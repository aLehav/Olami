Like many college students, Tiger Lam and Sallar Tahbaz found it difficult to make plans during their freshman year because all of their friends had different schedules. Learning from their frustrations, they decided to take matters into their own hands. The duo created Hangski, an app that allows users to input their schedules and see when their friends are available, to help other students avoid this issue.
The app, which launched Nov. 18, makes it easier for users to see their friend’s availability  and message them or make a group chat ideally leading to more spontaneous plans. 
“So we developed this idea because this would allow you to know exactly when all of your friends would be available at any point,” said Lam, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “When you’re bored, you can just see who is available and then text them — people who you wouldn’t have texted in the first place.” 
Lam came up with the idea during high school but only started working on it with his roommate in Fall 2018. They hired a developer in India to create the app. 
“It took about a year and a half to finally push it to market … so it’s been a while, but now that we’ve released it, we’re really happy with the results,” said Tahbaz, a sophomore majoring in real estate development. 
The app contains three pages that include messages, a directory and the user’s profile. The directory page shows the friends’ statuses, and the profile shows the user’s own availability status and interests.
Users can share their availability through a green, yellow or gray dot on their status to show whether they are available, may be available later or are unavailable. 
Lam and Tahbaz looked to apps such as Snapchat, Instagram and Skype when developing the feature that shows when users are on the app. Tahbaz said he wanted to use this feature in a way that would help people meet up in real life, rather than just show when they could chat with each other online. 
“We pretty much found out a way that this would be the best way to bring people together through the use of statuses, which no app is currently doing,” Tahbaz said. “I think it’s a pretty new market … but I think that one big app could really just change the entire landscape and cause a lot of more apps to come into play.”
Lam and Tahbaz are trying to grow the app’s usership by marketing primarily through social media and posting on college Facebook pages. 
“A lot of people enjoyed the UI [user interface] of the app. It’s really clean, it’s really basic. We’re slowly gaining traction,” Lam said. “We’re just slowly trying to gain more traction to get some more users on the app and hope that it grows bigger in the coming few months.”
Robert Tang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said he started using the app after he heard about it from his friends and said he liked how convenient the app made it for him to hang out with friends he wouldn’t normally see. 
“[The app] makes it really easy to just go straight to who’s free to hang right now instead of having to ask a bunch of people,” Tang said. “It’s a wonderful accessory on top of your other messaging apps.”
Lam said he believes the app would be useful to other students like him who had faced trouble coordinating plans or didn’t know who to hang out with when they were bored, especially on a large college campus that can be isolating for students who aren’t involved in organizations.
He said they are already working on an update to make the app more accessible, allowing users to upload their class schedule and personal activities so the app can automatically change their status. 
“I think that would help a lot because a lot of people find it a little bit tedious to change your status every time you’re free and change your status every time you’re not free,” Lam said. 
Tahbaz said the app has made it easier for him and his friends to plan activities with others and helped him avoid scheduling conflicts and miscommunications. 
“It definitely has been easier,” Tahbaz said. “We’ve been using it, and it’s made it more convenient for us to figure out who’s available and who’s not at whatever time that we want to hang out, go get something to eat or go watch a movie or something.”

Men’s water polo — Joe Skinner, assistant sports editor
Grade: A-
After going 14-5 against regular season and playoff opponents, USC men’s water polo’s stellar 2019 campaign is nearly complete. 	The players and coaches had to overcome a great deal of adversity this year but now find themselves ranked No. 2 in the nation with an opportunity to win their second consecutive NCAA Championship this weekend.
After it was discovered in March that longtime head coach Jovan Vavic was involved in the college admissions scandal, former assistant coaches Marko Pintaric and Casey Moon have stepped up to lead a talented roster to its 15th consecutive appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
Whenever a program puts itself in a position to win a national title, it deserves an A grade of one kind or another. This season’s water polo team earns an A- because USC had its share of ups and downs. That said, the downs were few and far between.
The team suffered just four defeats over the course of the regular season. These losses came against highly skilled competition in UC Santa Barbara, Pacific and Pepperdine — each of these programs rank in the top six nationally. The Trojans’ lone postseason defeat thus far came in the opening round of the MPSF tournament against Cal in Berkeley, though USC defeated the Golden Bears up north the weekend prior.
With just three wins standing between them and the 2019 National Collegiate Men’s Water Polo Championship, the Trojans still have a chance to turn that A- into an A+.
Women’s soccer — Harrison Cho, assistant sports editor
Grade: A-
The No. 9 USC women’s soccer team’s season came to a close with a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to No. 2-ranked UNC in the NCAA quarterfinals this past Friday. The Trojans ended the season at a solid 17-5-1 and made it further into the postseason then they had the past two years. For the third season in a row, head coach Keidane McAlpine put forth an elite unit, but the team could not pull off enough big wins to separate itself from the rest of the pack. Because of this, the team gets an A- instead of an A. 
The huge losses to Cal, Washington and UCLA during Pac-12 play demonstrated that USC was not quite at the same level as teams like Stanford and Virginia. Although USC could have played better in the Pac-12, McAlpine still did an impressive job leading USC to its third Elite Eight. Next year, the Trojans will return players such as sophomore forward Penelope Hocking, junior forward Tara McKeown and redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins in an attempt to improve upon this season’s effort. 
Football — Nathan Ackerman, sports editor
Grade: B-
This season hasn’t exactly been the pinnacle of USC football, but it hasn’t been quite the trainwreck many think. USC picked up a few solid wins this year, knocking off now-No. 6 Utah and dominating then-ranked Stanford by 25. It competed with then-No. 9 Notre Dame until the fourth quarter and only lost by 3 on the road, and it picked up convincing wins against Cal, Arizona and UCLA.
Underrecruited freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis emerged as one of the nation’s best signal-callers, senior wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. is a Biletnikoff Award finalist, the team overcame injuries to several running backs and the defense took considerable strides forward despite subpar coaching. 
Still, USC lost to a poor BYU team, almost blew a 27-point lead against Arizona State and its backup quarterback, nearly lost to Colorado and got demolished by 32 points against Oregon at home. 
A season in which USC, given all its talent, doesn’t at least win the Pac-12 South cannot earn a particularly high mark. This season has been littered with inconsistency, and USC never really seemed to find its groove against good competition. The Trojans’ 8-4 record isn’t anything worthy of excitement —  it’s above average but, for this program, underwhelming.
Women’s volleyball — Michelle Mankoff, beat writer
Grade: C
The women’s volleyball team never quite reached its potential all year. Injuries plagued a group that started as the No. 14 squad in the nation. Early in the season, All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier was out for a couple of weeks with a concussion. Junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin suffered an Achilles injury in November, which put extra pressure on Lanier to produce. 
Despite her early injury, Lanier was a rare bright spot this season for the Trojans. She tallied 40 kills against Utah, the second-highest mark ever by a USC player. Lanier rose to second in the all-time kill category for USC behind only former Trojan great Sam Bricio.
USC was swept in the final match of the regular season, dropping to a 17-13 overall record. The Trojans were never able to string together a significant series of wins, with their longest win streak spanning just three matches. The team lost seven five-set matches during the year and won just four. The only top-tier team USC beat this season was Washington, whom they defeated twice. Ultimately, many of USC’s victories came against weaker opponents. All that said, USC has a chance to improve its mark with a deep tournament run, but the road will be tough.

Six USC schools have joined forces to form the Election Security and Information Project, a program that will employ on-the-ground training sessions in all 50 U.S. states to educate election officials about election fraud prevention. 
The training sessions are slated to begin in February and will continue through September. Each session will be led by at least two USC faculty members in addition to experts from other industries such as cybersecurity groups and government agencies.
The project is a collaboration between the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Gould School of Law, the Price School of Public Policy, the Marshall School of Business and the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“As far as we know, USC is the only private entity which is going to be on the ground in all 50 states as part of this cybersecurity initiative,” said Adam Powell, the managing director of the project. 
The curriculum comprises three areas of election security: cyber safety, disinformation and malicious bots and crisis communications. Powell said the content will be simplified for accessibility to avoid computer science jargon and coding.
The precursor to the project was a partnership with the National Governors Association with support from the Democracy Fund. Through this partnership, the team of USC faculty traveled to six states and presented election fraud prevention tools tailored to each state’s electoral system. 
While this first project inspired the current one, Powell emphasized the differences in scale and target audience. 
“This is a very different project not only in size but also in focus,” Powell said. “Instead of having small closed meetings which we’ve been having in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles and around the country, these will be open sessions so we could have quite a few people coming.”
The new project’s sessions will be open to the public, including campaign leaders, election officials and the students and faculty at colleges where the training sessions will be held. 
“[The sessions are] directed primarily [by] anyone who’s involved in elections: candidates, parties, campaigns, state and local election workers,” Powell said. “Our primary mission is to share best practices in election cybersecurity. Our focus is going to be sharing best practices to do the best job we can — not only tell people about systems and principles but to help people internalize, ‘You don’t click on that link.’ That was what we saw in 2016.”
The project aims to educate those on the ground about best practices for conducting elections after learning from the mistakes made in past ones, including the recent elections in Louisiana and Minnesota that resulted in electoral fraud.
“This is a huge issue for every country and every state to protect the integrity of elections,” project principal investigator and  professor Geoffrey Cowan said. “Our piece of it is to really try to help all 50 states think about how they can be less likely to have their system exposed to problems.”
The project is funded by Google, which allocated the project team a seven-figure grant to facilitate the sessions.
“In advance of the 2020 election, we are committed to enhancing election security for voters, campaigns and journalists alike,” said Kristie Canegallo, vice president of Google’s Trust and Safety team said in a November press release from the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy.
While national attention has mostly focused on presidential election fraud, Cowan said hacking is prevalent in state and municipal elections, too. The project’s bipartisan team includes Center for the Political Future directors Mike Murphy and Bob Shrum, two former campaign staffers who have worked on congressional, gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.
“This is not just one country, it’s not just one political party, it’s not just one office,” Cowan said. “It’s an issue that’s going to be with us for a long time, and hopefully we’ll help the states to protect themselves against it — not just in the presidential race but for state and local elections, too.”

With just four weeks left in the NFL regular season, the weight of each game is increasing. As any football fan knows, earning a first-round bye significantly improves a team’s likelihood of competing for a conference championship or even a Super Bowl.
This week, I’ll focus on the four most important remaining games this season that have the potential to shift the playoff picture.
Week 14: San Francisco 49ers at New Orleans Saints
Two heavyweights in the NFC are going head-to-head Sunday, and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs could be on the line. The 49ers dropped to 10-2 after losing a close game in Baltimore to the hottest team in football, and the Saints became the first team to clinch their division last Thursday.
However, the Saints could still see an edge — traveling halfway across the country for another early game will surely take a toll on the 49ers, and the Superdome is one of the toughest places to win in the NFL. 
When San Francisco’s offense is on the field, the key matchup will be its dominant running game (No. 2 in the league) against the Saints’ sturdy run defense (No. 3 in the league). The Saints pass defense has been suspect at times, and Niners quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo’s ability to exploit this advantage may be the deciding factor in this game.
When New Orleans’ offense is on the field, it will need to create big plays against a suffocating 49ers defense that has allowed the fewest yards per game and second-fewest points per game this season. 
Left tackle Terron Armstead may return from his ankle injury, and his presence could make the difference against the 49ers’ dominant pass rush. Saints receiver Michael Thomas has been unstoppable; it’ll be interesting to see if the 49ers are able to slow him down. 
The winner of this game controls its destiny in the race for the NFC’s No. 1 seed.
Week 14: Kansas City Chiefs at New England Patriots
It’s been almost a full year since the Patriots went into Kansas City and won the AFC Championship en route to quarterback Tom Brady’s sixth Super Bowl victory. While neither of these teams has been as dominant as they were last season, this game still has the power to impact the AFC playoff seeding and, perhaps more importantly, gives the Chiefs a chance to prove they have the ability to compete with anyone in the AFC.
The vulnerability of the Patriots’ offense was exposed on national TV in last week’s loss to the Texans, and the question of whether Brady is washed is resurfacing. The Chiefs are coming off a blowout win over the Raiders, who seemingly had the potential to compete for the AFC West, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes is starting to find his rhythm after missing two games due to a dislocated kneecap. 
The Patriots’ greatest strength is their defense, although it has been susceptible to mobile quarterbacks like Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson and Houston’s Deshaun Watson in recent weeks.
On the other side of the ball, the Chiefs defense has been average at best, coming in at No. 25 in yards per game and No. 16 in points per game. Brady and the New England offense will need to bounce back after struggling against the mediocre Texans defense. 
A Chiefs win would bring them one step closer to a highly sought-after first-round bye and increase Baltimore’s chances at home-field advantage in the AFC. 
Week 16: Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings
The NFC North title will likely be on the line when Green Bay and Minnesota meet Monday, Dec. 23. 
With the division title comes the right to host a playoff game rather than spend the playoffs on the road as a wild card team. Both teams have had their share of triumphs and struggles so far. The Packers’ offense looked elite in wins over the Cowboys and Raiders, but it faltered both times they traveled west, resulting in ugly losses to the Chargers and 49ers.
The Vikings lost the first time they faced the Packers back in Week 2, but quarterback Kirk Cousins has stepped up the last few weeks, and Dalvin Cook has been one of the league’s best running backs. If Cousins continues playing at a high level, it is difficult to fathom the Packers beating the Vikings in Minnesota, but if he collapses on the big stage as he is known to do, you can expect another wild card playoff appearance for the Vikings.
Week 17: San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks
This looks to be another division-deciding game, as the Seahawks have kept pace with the 49ers’ elite performance so far this season. These teams hold two of the best records in the NFC, meaning a bye week or even the No. 1 seed could be at stake come Week 17.
The first meeting between the two was an overtime thriller that came down to missed kicks and saw Seattle hand San Francisco its first loss of the season. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has arguably been the league MVP so far, pulling off one miraculous play after another to keep the Seahawks in nearly every game. 
The 49ers’ elite defense must make adjustments to contain Wilson the second time around while remaining unfazed by the noise at CenturyLink Field. One can only hope for another fantastic battle between these two bitter rivals, who just might see each other a third time in the postseason.

On Justin Accardi’s birthday last year, his two best friends Prerika Chawla and Marcelle Saulnier took him out to brunch in downtown Los Angeles. They spent the day exploring the city and wandering through the dim maze of books in The Last Bookstore. The three friends had bonded over a sketch comedy group their freshman year, so celebrating the day surrounded by words, history and art couldn’t have been more perfect.
One year later, Accardi would have been 21 years old.
“I still remember that [day] and feel happy, but it’s just so sad that this year’s different,” said Saulnier, a junior majoring in creative writing and French.
Accardi passed away Sept. 5. He had battled depression for many years and died by suicide. 
In honor of their son, Selena and Jim Accardi have launched a foundation that will provide grants and scholarships for students studying cinematic arts. Accardi’s parents officially announced the foundation’s launch Monday, what would have been his 21st birthday. The Justin Accardi Foundation for the Arts will provide funding for student projects and films “that capture Justin’s visionary spirit and reflect his positive impact through the arts,” the website read.
“He had such a passion for music and cinema and media and was also just naturally brilliant, just naturally intelligent,” said Selena Accardi, Justin’s mother. “[He] cared about the world and politics and nature and the environment and just everything. When you have a child like that from an early age, it makes you pay attention to things bigger than yourself.”
Chawla, a junior majoring in cognitive science, was the initial founder of the sketch comedy group that led her to connect with Justin. She had reached out to people over Facebook to encourage them to join and gather ideas for the group. Accardi was one of the first people to respond.
“He just messaged me with a whole list of ideas that we could do for our sketches, and through that, since we’d be meeting every week and just trying to make new videos and content, we’d … write a lot of jokes all the time,” Chawla said. “We just became super close from that.”
From that point on, Chawla and Accardi’s friendship grew out of their shared love for acting and comedy. Creativity was something that enthralled both of them, and they spent hours together bringing their ideas to life through sketches and videos. Their favorite activities included watching films or old episodes of “Seinfeld” and having long, in-depth talks about what they thought. 
“We were in the same Intro to Cinema class and after every movie we watched, it would take me a few minutes to still decide whether I even liked the movie or not, but he had a full-blown analysis already ready of the movie and all of its pros and cons, and what he thinks about that,” Chawla said. “So it used to be really fun to talk to him about anything creative.”
Though the foundation is new, Accardi’s parents hope to give at least one scholarship to a student at their son’s high school, Cherry Hill High School East in Cherry Hill, NJ, where he cultivated his passion for performing arts. Ultimately, however, they hope the money will go toward students at USC and from the surrounding community.
“We want to make sure that the students that receive the scholarships are somebody that uphold his values, that believe in the industry, [that they] aren’t looking to go into the industry because [they want to] make a lot of money,” Jim Accardi said.  “It’s really about making an impact in the work they want to do.”
UnderSCore a Capella, a student organization that Justin was a part of, began a fundraiser in November. It started as a GoFundMe for the recording of a tribute song titled “Say Love” but flourished into a larger fundraiser to support the foundation.
“Justin was a unique person and no one will ever be quite like him, but there are so many other people out there who are just as passionate and just as ready to pursue their creative ideas,” Saulnier said. “We should be able to create without limits and without restriction and without fear because I think there’s something really beautiful in just being able to go for what you believe in. I know that he would have loved to see whatever comes of it and whoever gets to benefit from it.”

Following a narrow home loss against Temple Nov. 22, the Trojans took on a talented field Thursday through Sunday in the Orlando Invitational. USC came home with third place behind two 2019 NCAA Tournament teams Marquette and No. 3 Maryland.
The Trojans made their way past Fairfield in the opening round, defeating the Stags 54-47. USC’s stout defense held Fairfield to just 27% shooting from the field and forced 10 turnovers.
The Trojans’ offense was fairly stagnant, scoring just 54 points on a 41.7% field goal percentage. Guards senior Jonah Mathews and sophomore Elijah Weaver and freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu monopolized the Trojans’ scoring effort, combining for 41 out of the team’s 54 points.
As in previous games this season, USC’s versatile defenders are making up for poor 3-point shooting performances, preventing opponents to capitalize on perimeter shots.
“Our guards played tough, especially against their perimeter shooters,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
Following the opening round victory, the Trojan defense was unable to hold up as effectively against Marquette. Marquette boasts the top scorer in the country in senior guard Markus Howard, who currently averages 29.3 points per game after putting up 51 points against the Trojans.
After USC surged to an early 11-5 lead, Howard went on an 11-0 solo run. The Trojans failed to match his offensive output and never led from that point on, falling 101-79 to the Golden Eagles.
“We didn’t play well. We really had trouble stopping Howard and what he did to our defense,” Enfield said after the loss. “But it’s one game, it’s one loss, so we have to bounce back mentally and physically.”
USC did just that against another quality opponent in Harvard. The Trojans stepped up to the plate and put together a complete game for a decisive 77-62 victory.
After giving up 43 points in the first half, USC made the necessary defensive adjustments to allow just 19 in the second. Okongwu led the way for the Trojans with 27 points on 12-of-14 shooting and 14 rebounds, while Mathews and graduate transfer guard Quinton Adlesh each added 12 points. Okongwu finished with his fourth double-double of the season, continuing to establish himself as one of the top freshmen in the country.
The big difference offensively against Harvard was the Trojans’ ability to shoot efficiently and get strong offensive production from their guards. At 49.2% from the field and 50% from behind the arc, USC had a balanced scoring effort. 
The Trojans’ stellar frontcourt continued to dominate. Okongwu and senior forward Nick Rakocevic have been a steady presence inside, with freshman forward Isaiah Mobley heating up as the season goes on. 
“[They were] too much for us to defend,” Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker said of the Trojans’ frontcourt.
While Rakocevic struggled in the opening round against Fairfield, shooting 2-of-9 for 5 points and conceding four turnovers, he improved his play over the next two matchups, shooting 60% from the field against Marquette and turning the ball over just once against Harvard.
After going 2-1 in the tournament and achieving its most complete victory of the year over a talented Harvard team, the Trojans hold a 7-2 record and have shown the potential to make noise in Pac-12 play.
After four days of rest, USC will head to Fort Worth and the brand new Dickies Arena to take on 5-1 TCU Friday night.

I can’t write to you about the definitive album of the decade or give you a hodgepodge of songs that make up the quintessential soundtrack of the 2010s. 
I was six months shy of 12 years old in January 2010, and my musical acumen in my early adolescence was better than most teenagers’ but pales in comparison to the listener and critic I am now and will be in another 10 years. 
It’s impossible to think of all the “important’’ albums I paid no attention to in middle school and the records that I held in ridiculously high regard due to my youth. 
Generally, if asked by friends or when replying to tweets for the standout project of the 2010s, I’d turn to Kanye West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” The rapper’s fifth studio album is 13 tracks and 68 minutes of unmatched production featuring Nicki Minaj’s hardest feature, an iconic sexually charged Chris Rock monologue and West’s fantasies of life and love mixed with his warped perceptions of reality. 
In my eyes, only a few albums outside of Ye’s brought varied musical stories in one concept album, creating something for everybody.
But in a decade where Nicki Minaj single-handedly resurged female rap and Kendrick Lamar dropped Pulitzer-winning “DAMN,” is there really one definitive album or even artist we can give the ’10s to?
With the rise and steady reign of Drake, Noname creeping up with her widely slept on but critically acclaimed debut and many eras of Tyler, the Creator, it’s hard to pick just one project which characterized and dominated the decade. 
So I’ve decided to shy away from this conversation plaguing the masses and music critics alike and turn inward. 
A month ago, I started a challenge on Instagram posting 10 albums that impacted me over 10 days. And in that bunch, only two of the records were released in this decade — Solange’s “A Seat At The Table” and J.Cole’s mixtape “Friday Night Lights.” I grappled with posting some of them, including Lady Gaga’s “The Fame and Dead Presidents Vol. 1/Music From The Motion Picture.” 
They didn’t seem like the “right” albums to post, the former almost too mainstream and the latter too random to be deemed impactful. But then I remembered the challenge was about me — not what critics said or what moved the general populace but what music is awe-inspiring to me. 
It’s not that the music of the 2010s wasn’t my cup of tea, but that the albums I posted are tethered to people and experiences rather than what I felt was the “best” or what was the most revered. My social media retrospection taught me the decade-defining albums, the ones we call “classics” are essential to rank and argue over but pale in comparison to the weight of the projects that moved us regardless of what the critics say. 
Yes, some projects reach and resonate with the masses and will do so for years beyond their release date — a typical marker of these so-called definitive albums. And modern music journalism wouldn’t be what it is today without arguments over Lamar’s best record or if Beck indeed should’ve won Album of the Year over Beyoncé at the 2015 Grammys. 
But to the listeners, I urge you to look at your life from 2010 to 2019 and give praise to the albums and songs that inspired you, excited you or made you feel something, regardless of what that feeling was. Forget what rose to the top of the Billboard charts, what Jon Caramanica mentioned on Popcast or what was even released this decade. The definitive record of the 2010s is what made you feel whole.
On April 1, 2017, my dad died. To cope, I cried, re-read old texts, listened to saved voicemails and went to therapy. But most importantly, I listened to music. I grew up running errands with my dad, every car ride ending with Earth, Wind & Fire’s “That’s The Way of The World.” Ingrained in my mind is my father singing the refrain on Miguel’s “Sure Thing.” And not more than a month would go by without hearing him play Steely Dan’s “Aja” in full. 
Up until around 4 p.m. on the day of his death, I was sure that Kanye’s “MBDTF” would stick as my “top” album of the 2010s but a pulmonary embolism changed that. 
My consumption as a listener from then on generally focused on healing wounds and taking myself back to the tan leather seats of my dad’s Toyota Land Cruiser. In comparison to my current reality, the world of fantasy I created through lengthy playlists titled “RIP DAD” could not be created by solely listening to “MBDTF.” The album, which I often push as the “record of the decade,” could not help me escape the never-ending pain and sorrow. 
If I had to pick just one album from the 2010s that single-handedly nursed me while in mourning, it would be Solange’s “A Seat at the Table.” “Cranes in the Sky” was therapy. I was “Mad,” just like the song and had the right to be. Every night that I cried myself to sleep ended with me awaking to “Rise.” 
When speaking of the differences between “A Seat at the Table” and her consecutive album “When I Get Home” the singer said, “with ‘A Seat At The Table’ I had so much to say. With this album, I had so much to feel.”
“A Seat at the Table” put words to the pain I felt — I mourned with this album. 
Nevertheless, picking just one album leaves out so many others that helped me grow from the most trying period in my life to date. What about the countless times I revisited Stevie Wonder to hear my dad’s favorites? Or the Chic I’d dance to in my room? I can’t forget the days where I played Earl Sweatshirt’s “Some Rap Songs” on an infinite loop, or gloss over tracks like “FEEL” or “Trauma” that didn’t directly address grief but made me feel something other than insurmountable loss. 
Anything I’d write about the “definitive” music of the decade would be deeply fictitious if I failed to mention each and every piece of music that helped me move past this “definitive” moment of my life. 
For myself, looking back on the music of the 2010s is less about what was the “best.” I don’t care to have an answer that is politically correct or paints me as a listener with the most exquisite and knowledgeable taste. I reflect on my 2010 to 2019 favorites to stand in my truth and express gratitude to this family of songs, interludes, skits and records that healed me.

Writer-director Rian Johnson isn’t content with making generic, run-of-the mill films. As controversial as “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” may be, there’s no disputing that Johnson wasn’t interested in making a conventional “Star Wars” film. Not at all. With “Knives Out,” Johnson once again takes the standards of a classic genre — the whodunit — and subverts them for an innovative, thrilling ride.
After the sudden death of renowned mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), detective Benoit Blanc (played by Daniel Craig with an exquisite Kentucky accent) is asked through an anonymous letter to figure out who is responsible for Thrombey’s death. Everyone in the family is a suspect in his murder. 
Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) realizes who Blanc is, saying, “I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you.” Lines like this cement the time in which the Thrombeys live in. Their residence does resemble the classic era of mystery novels: with bookshelves casting a looming presence as they reach the ceiling and a wide assortment of knives circulating around a chair. 
However, they don’t live in the classic era of whodunits from the ’60s and ’70s. This is a family that argues about the Trump administration, Harlan’s son Walter (Michael Shannon) wants to sell his dad’s TV rights to Netflix for millions and Joni makes her living as a lifestyle “influencer,” whatever that means.
Despite the modern setting, Johnson still pays homage to the murder mysteries of Agatha Christie, as Blanc attempts to uncover each clue and question every suspect, no matter how innocent or guilty they appear to be. Contradictory accounts of what happened the night of Harlan’s death make Blanc “suspect foul play.” The Thrombeys can’t even be trusted in recounting an argument. They can’t stand to be perceived as unlikeable. 
Johnson isn’t completely opposed to the cat-and-mouse game that has worked in the past. He pits Blanc against the Thrombeys in their elaborate mansion for much of the film — a standard in mystery films to create tension between the characters. He’s just more interested in finding new ways to work within an already established genre.
The Thrombeys comprise a star-studded cast that also includes Jamie Lee Curtis, LaKeith Stanfield, Chris Evans and Katherine Langford. The most surprising part of “Knives Out,” aside from all its intricate plot twists, is how much of a backseat the Thrombey clan takes. Even Blanc, the lead investigator, isn’t the main character through which we experience the movie. 
That role falls to Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), an immigrant whose sincerity stands out (through a literal biological inability to lie) among the narcissistic and entitled Thrombeys. Concern over receiving their portion of the will produces more concern and worry than resolving what happened to one of their very own. Harlan’s own forged success spoiled the rest of the family into being dependent upon his wealth.
A running gag occurs in which the family can’t seem to remember which country she was born in — a different Latin American country is mentioned each time. It’s a subtle reminder of the unconscious prejudices and insincerity the family truly exudes. The challenges that the wealthy Thrombeys face pales in comparison to those of Marta, who lives in a small apartment fearing for the well-being of her undocumented mother.
As effective as Johnson’s class commentary is, there are still a few moments where the inclusion of politics and pop culture is a bit too on the nose. It’s not that the lines themselves aren’t witty or comedic — they are, but they reek of surface-level social commentary intended to be culturally relevant compared to the better executed commentary exhibited in Cabrera’s plot line. For example, Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson), Thrombey’s son-in-law, makes a reference to the musical “Hamilton” with the line “Immigrants: They get the job done.” It shows that the family doesn’t understand Marta’s genuine fear of deportation, but it’s impact falls short compared to when Drysdale pretends to care for her, only to hand her a dirty plate without even looking at her. These small gestures of hypocrisy do more than a throwaway pop-culture reference. 
“Knives Out” first and foremost excels as an intricate mystery film. That’s what audiences are going to want: the unexpected turns. They want to be the detective alongside Blanc, guessing who the culprit may be. The twists along the way, for the most part, never appear to be simply for shock value. As keen as audiences are in trying to figure out a film before it’s over, with “Knives Out,” it’s better to just let the film play out and reveal itself. 
It’s apparent that Johnson planned out every meticulous detail and twist to ensure they serve the plot first before anything. Alongside cinematographer Steve Yedlin’s close-up shots of the characters and tendency to linger on certain objects, the film is both a visual and textual achievement in engaging its viewers.
Straying away from the CGI, big-budget spectacle that is the “Star Wars” franchise, Johnson reverts to a classic yet innovative murder-mystery tale. The quest to find out who killed the patriarch of the Thrombey family and why they did so unravels into a film about how kindness and honesty go a long way in a country exploited by material and societal wealth. But, if you aren’t interested in all the subtext, “Knives Out” works just as well as a thrilling film that’ll keep you guessing until the very end.

It may seem to the world that with his new EP “No Roof Access,” Kyle Lux is just getting started. However, Lux’s talent has already been recognized by many. 
The artist (née Kyle Tolbert) has been featured on several Spotify playlists, including Fresh Finds, Alternative R&B, Libra and Lorem. 
Lux’s musical career began in his church and school choir. His stage name is a nod to this foundation and a reminder of his roots. 
“Around the time when I was deciding what my artist name would be … and how it’s just used like glorious light and talking about God, and I thought it would be fitting to tie it into my name since I really started in music with church,” said Lux, a sophomore majoring in popular music. “Even though I’m not Catholic, it’s still just talking about the same God, so I thought it’d be fitting to have that in my name as just a reminder of where I came from.” 
For his junior and senior years of high school, Lux left his public high school to attend the South Carolina Governor’s School for the Arts & Humanities, where he concentrated in music. For the first time, he was surrounded by fellow artists and was given the confidence to really consider a career in music. 
“Having that community of artists, being in a place where you’re encouraged to do what you love — that was invaluable to me,” Lux said. “And that kind of gave me confidence to do my own music and really just was a big foundation for me … It wasn’t really encouraged before I went there.”
It was there that he met his best friend, New York University sophomore Layton Davis, who has supported Lux’s career since the beginning. Davis made the cover art for Lux’s first six singles. By working with him, Davis noticed that Lux was extremely patient when it came to his music. 
“He’s a bit of a perfectionist, which is really annoying to work with … But he’s only that way because he has a very specific vision, and he knows exactly what he wants things to look like and what will look best,” Davis said. “He’s pretty spontaneous and super high-energy, but he’s very patient with his work.”
Davis was there when Lux received an email from his soon-to-be manager, Justin Lehmann of Mischief Management. Lux, having found Lehmann’s contact information from his client Aminé’s Instagram bio, decided to send him an email with a link to a song he had just released. 
When Lehmann first heard the song, he was struck by Lux’s raw voice. Lehmann said the song got stuck in his head. He spoke to Lux the same day he received the email and has been his manager ever since. In those three years, Lehmann has watched Lux grow as an artist.
“He’s improved at his craft in the sense that the songs he’s making now are leagues abound of where he’s started,” Lehmann said. “He also has a much better understanding of himself in the sense of the art, the persona and [the] story that he wants to put forward about his art but also about himself.”
Lux did not feel a true connection to the music he was making prior to this year because he was making it for a specific audience. However, this changed after the release of his first single, “Rollin’ Stone,” earlier this year. Lux began making music for himself rather than an audience. Because of this, he began to think of himself as an artist.
“I felt completely grounded in what I was doing,” Lux said. “I was doing what I wanted to do and putting that out in the world and being OK with that.”
His debut EP “No Roof Access” was released Nov. 15. Three years in the making, the EP represents the culmination of his artistic development thus far. The songs on the album draw inspiration from artists such as Solange, James Blake, Gabriel Garzon-Montano and Frank Ocean. 
“I look back a lot, and so I wanted this EP to be something I looked back and there wouldn’t be that much I wanted to change about it,” Lux said. “People are just gonna have that impression [of the music] for the rest of their lives, so I just wanted it to be the best it could be.”
Lehmann believes that Lux’s patience while making the EP is what sets him apart from other artists. 
“The fact that we’ve been working together as long as we have and are only putting out his first project now is a testament to the fact that he’s patient, which a lot of artists might not be,” Lehmann said. “It’s not the easiest thing to say ‘I’m just gonna really, really take my time on this, I don’t need to be putting out music immediately’ … I think it’s the mark of an artist that really cares a lot about their craft and about making sure that it’s quality over quantity.” 
This EP shows a vulnerable side of Lux, and the feeling of people knowing details about his life was slightly odd to him, he said. However, he believes that the best music comes out of this vulnerability and hopes that listeners will be inspired to overcome feelings that hold them back.
Despite the recent release, Lux is already looking toward the future, and he plans to put out an album. However, he is in no rush to do so, thanks to the stability that USC provides. 
“Being able to be at school is definitely comforting, knowing that I’m here for two more years, so it’s like there’s no rush for me to do anything,” Lux said. “I have time to really just sit back and take my time with this album and I’m definitely gonna take that time.”

Think of the worst customer service you’ve ever experienced or the worst quality food or product you’ve ever purchased. Chances are whoever interested you into buying the product could afford not to put as much effort into pleasing you. In other words, the interaction or purchase was your choice alone — there were no competitors. 
It’s common knowledge that increased competition leads to lower prices, better customer relations and overall more benefits to consumers — it’s the simple logic of supply and demand. That’s why the United States enforces an antitrust law and has engaged in trust-busting since President Teddy Roosevelt’s time. 
All competition stems from one common denominator: increased knowledge to the consumer. Say what you will about the Trump Administration, and especially about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, but their policy to release salary earnings data per college per major is a paramount step in forcing universities to offer students better deals for a lower price. 
Following through on a March executive order, the Trump Administration recently released first-year salary and average debt data for each college and each major within that college. The data, collected based on federal tax returns, allows prospective students to browse and compare colleges and ultimately make a more informed decision about what school they want to attend based on the financial offer they are likely to be awarded upon finding a job after graduating. 
“The best way to attack the ever-rising cost of college is to drive real transparency,” DeVos said in a statement.
While the student debt crisis is in full swing, the data reveals that in the majority of programs, average first-year earnings for students top average debt. The common perception that STEM majors make the most coming out of college proved true, according to the data: The best debt-earnings ratio hails from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where math students take on an average debt of around $8,000 and earn more than $120,000 their first year out of college. 
Yet the common trend that the more selective the school, the better the ratio also holds true. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the typical bachelor’s degree from the University of Alabama results in roughly $25,000 in student debt and a first-year income of only $14,000. 
However, the WSJ, which analyzed the data extensively, pointed out that there are some red flags, proving that students ought to be wise in choosing their majors. Even in a highly selective school such as Columbia University, rhetoric and composition/writing studies majors graduate with a median $28,556 in student debt yet earn just $19,700 in their first year. Similarly, at USC, a master’s degree in drama and theater arts costs graduates $100,796; they earned just $30,800 in their first year.
Thanks to the availability of the data, which excludes programs with too few students to protect their privacy, students have the opportunity to think twice before committing to a particular university given the financial payoff they receive after graduating. The data reveals  that choosing a school like USC, for example, is often a safe bet. USC graduates have an average of $24,000 in debt, less than the national average of $29,000. 
That said, if a student is admitted as a sociology major and is projected to have to take more than $13,000 in loans, perhaps that student should reconsider USC, given that the median total debt for a sociology major at USC is $13,000 with expected first-year earnings of $33,600. 
Of course, every student and every situation is different. One’s salary shouldn’t be the only factor in deciding where to attend college. The data is meant only to be a supplement to every other factor. However, the salary and debt information are undeniably an important data set to put increased pressure on low-performing schools. It will force them to either better their scholarship offers, better their education or risk losing applicants. That is the nature and power of competition.

At USC, more than 2,500 undergraduate and graduate students are 40 years or older. 
Obtaining higher education is not meant for any specific age groups, it is meant for everyone. Sure, most undergraduate students are typically between 18 and 22 years old, but that does not apply to every student. There are plenty of students who do not identify with the “normal” college age but that does not make them any different from the larger student body.
Everyone comes from a different background and different circumstances that may impact the time and place they may obtain a college education. For instance, there are 1,200 enrolled veterans at USC per semester. It’s important to avoid making generalizations when it comes to age and education and be more inclusive of others. 
Those within the average college student age should be more informed and aware of the wider range of individuals that make up the entire student community on college campuses, specifically here at USC — without treating them differently. You would not ask a 20-year-old looking student how old they are, so why ask a 30-or 40-year-old looking student? Why does it matter how old they are? They are here for the exact same reason you are, which is to get a college education. 
Ageism is not something that is often as heightened as something such as sexism. But it is just as prevalent. Like sexism, it is a form of prejudice but on the grounds of a person’s age. Older students are often stigmatized on campus because they are generally underrepresented. People may make assumptions or stereotypes — or as mentioned, ask their age — which can be intrusive or make one feel uncomfortable. That is not to say that younger students should not ask older students questions if they are just curious about their life path, but they should be more mindful with what kinds of questions they may ask and how. 
At USC, 38.3% of students are ages 25 and over. This population of students may be made up of veterans, working parents, international student or simply those who desired the opportunity for a college education. There is an array of diverse students on campus who all have a story that led them here. These stories can be shared with others and conversations are invited. But it is important to be respectful of others and inclusive. 
Yes, older students exist on campus. Yes, they may stand out in a lecture filled with a majority of students who recently graduated from high school. No, asking their age because you’re just “curious” is not appropriate because it can make someone feel uncomfortable or put on the spot. Instead invite them for a conversation like you would with any other student and share your stories with one another. Be open-minded about other people’s pathways and know that there is more than one. 
Not everyone on campus is part of the “average.” But that’s what makes USC a more diverse community.

“Good afternoon, guys,” “I don’t see color — just people,” “What’s your major? I bet it’s computer science,” ‘’Where are you from? … OK, but where are you really from?” 
These subtleties, despite being such commonly used phrases among students and professors alike, can manifest as snide remarks and unintentional insults toward subordinate groups. 
They are called microaggressions —  everyday verbal or nonverbal insults that communicate negative messages or hostility to marginalized groups. Microaggressions can be based on race, sex, gender identity, socioeconomic status and other factors. On college campuses specifically, they can occur among students, faculty and staff — or between students and professors. They can include a professor refusing to use a student’s preferred gender pronouns or mispronouncing a student’s name after being repeatedly corrected. 
Although they seem trivial, microaggressions are so prevalent on college campuses that people can undermine their racist, sexist and heteronormative undertones that alienate marginalized groups. To help combat this issue, the University must spread awareness to the entire student population, but that starts with professors who also exhibit these behaviors. To cultivate a more inclusive learning culture, USC professors should be mandated to undergo inclusion and microaggression training with the ultimate goal of educating students and creating environments more conducive to learning. 
Professors teach on this campus to communicate their fields of expertise to a diverse student body from varying cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds. However, the use of microaggressions turns the classroom into a noninclusive environment and insecure learning space. Because this reflects poorly for both the professor and the University, USC must take the initiative to ensure its faculty is not discriminatory. 
After all, by attending a University that prides itself on its diverse student population, students should feel comfortable learning in a setting where their identities are not devalued by educators through microaggressions. Implementing a program — whether it be an online program akin to AlcoholEdu or a training seminar led by a sociologist — would shed light on the subliminal meanings of such metamessages.
For instance, although using “guys” to refer to a class of individuals on different parts of the gender spectrum appears harmless, it could insinuate male-identifying individuals as dominant and all others as less significant. Assuming a student’s major based solely on their race could stereotype the entire group to one skill. Exclusively using heteronormative examples could disregard the other portion of the sex spectrum apart from heterosexuality. While ostensibly menial, backhanded actions like these isolate marginalized groups as abnormal and as if they do not belong, which could make a learning environment feel less open to everybody. 
While interacting with professors outside of lecture can be beneficial to students’ success, students may not feel comfortable talking to a professor outside of class because of comments that inadvertently discriminate against them and demoralize them. This would put underrepresented groups at even more of a disadvantage compared to the majority. 
Instilling a mandatory training for professors would be one step closer to providing all students with equal opportunities to succeed, at least in the classroom. Plus, this sort of program would not be new to campus — certain students actually do have to go through microaggression training. Resident assistants, for example, undergo a two-day training on equity and inclusion to learn about racial inequalities, historical trends of discrimination and microaggressions. 
This allows RAs to be better equipped to foster living atmospheres that are inclusive to all identities and backgrounds. While this training is especially pertinent in the residential housing branch, the University should translate its efficacy to the classroom where prejudiced remarks of different magnitudes are still prevalent. 
Ideally, this training would not only improve the way professors conduct their class but also the way students conduct themselves out of class. Whether participating in a class discussion or listening to a professor’s lecture style, students can also understand the implications behind microaggressions and the reasons for avoiding them. Students could then contextualize this knowledge by interacting with peers and strangers, which would directly reflect a university that produces conscientious individuals who are also capable of promoting safer workspaces and atmospheres. 
By educating professors about these insinuations, USC could make great strides in acknowledging microaggressions as a macroscopic problem. And it all starts with a shift in vocabulary and mindset — for what seems like a microscopic adjustment today could cause drastic change tomorrow.
