When USC classes begin Aug. 22, it will be the first time the traditional academic school year will begin in California without a statewide enforced school mask mandate since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in an interview with the Daily Trojan on Monday that the University anticipates a surge in positive cases as a result of students and faculty returning to school and encourages students to wear masks regardless of regulations. 
Van Orman indicated that Student Health is not currently considering mandating a second booster as part of the University’s vaccination requirements. As of last semester, over 95% of students and faculty are vaccinated with the primary series and approximately 86 to 87% of students and faculty are vaccinated with the booster in addition to the primary series. 
In response to the development of the Novavax vaccine — which uses copies of coronavirus’ outer coating, the spike protein, to make nanoparticles that are delivered into the body to train the immune system against infection — Van Orman said the University is currently waiting to confirm with USC pharmacies on its availability to students and faculty. The Novavax vaccine uses a “more traditional method” of moth cells and tree bark as opposed to mRNA vaccines — Pfizer and Moderna — or viral vector vaccines — Johnson & Johnson. 
“Novavax is a very good COVID-19 vaccine … the data on it is equivalent, as far as we can see, to the other vaccines that are approved such as Pfizer and Moderna,” Van Orman said. “It’s a very good choice for people. There don’t seem to be any particular sort of advantages or disadvantages compared to the other mRNA vaccines we have.”
For people who are unvaccinated and concerned about the relatively novel mRNA technology, Van Orman said, the Novavax vaccine’s traditional composition makes an appropriate addition. Van Orman said people have concerns that vaccines which are developed quickly or perceived as newer technology are unsafe. However, she said that vaccine technology is constantly evolving, and that having mRNA and traditional protein vaccines are important because they give people options that they can select based on their personal preferences. 
“​​I think somehow the narrative was picked up that [mRNA vaccines] were very new technology,’’ Van Orman said. “We certainly know that [concern] can be heightened by disinformation and misinformation, as the pandemic rolled out, which was being perpetuated by various people for ideological reasons. We never want to minimize people’s real fears … but it definitely gives people a choice.”
The Novavax vaccine is currently offered in two doses in the primary series, which are given three to eight weeks apart. Although there is currently no booster dose available, Van Orman said that it is possible that people who receive Novavax may require a booster shot as time passes.
“[Traditional protein vaccines and mRNA vaccines] are just different ways of introducing your body to the protein … so your body then makes an immune response to that protein, and when it encounters the protein from the actual infection, it already has an immune response waiting,” Van Orman said. “We just imagined that some people might want to choose a protein-based vaccine, and so now they have Novavax as a solution.”
Although the University will no longer conduct weekly surveillance testing, Van Orman said students should test even when experiencing minimal symptoms or when they suspect infection. Student Health recommends testing with antigen tests — which are available at drugstores, by mail through the U.S. Postal Service and will be available at USC testing stations — one and three days after exposure. Another time to take a test, Van Orman said, is when people expect to be in a high-risk environment or situation, such as traveling. 
“People should very much consider testing if they’re going to be visiting someone that might be at higher risk, so if you’re going to visit someone who’s ill — an older relative or children — testing before you’re going into an environment where you could inadvertently spread to someone who might be at higher risk are really the environments that we most recommend people consider testing in,” Van Orman said.

USC experts in social work, constitutional law and nursing are concerned about abortion access in restrictive states following the Supreme Court’s repeal of abortion rights case Roe v. Wade June 24, bringing to discussion the overturn’s impact on healthcare and various areas of law. 
The overturn returns authority to the states, said Nomi Stolzenberg, the Nathan and Lilly Shapell Chair in Law at the Gould School of Law, meaning that individual states can decide whether or not to regulate abortion, ban abortion entirely, insert protections of abortion as a right in their state constitution or create any exceptions — exceptions are decided by each state and can include or not include rape, incest or threat to a mother’s life. 
A vote on Proposition 1 in November will allow Californians to decide whether the right to an abortion and the right to contraception is included in the state’s constitution. Kansan voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have banned the right to an abortion Tuesday, becoming the first state to decide on abortion rights since the repeal. Other states deciding these rights in November include Vermont, Kentucky and Montana. 
However, Stolzenberg said the Supreme Court’s opinion does not say abortion rights are entirely up to the states. The Court is instead delegating power to the people to vote for their elected representatives who enable Congress to pass legislation.
“The people have both state elected representatives and federal elected representatives so … essentially it is returning the authority to Congress to enact legislation, if it so chooses, every bit as much as it’s returning power to the States,” Stolzenberg said. “It’s basically saying this is a matter for the legislature, not the courts to decide, and that could be the federal legislature or Congress, or it could be the legislatures of individual states.”
Stolzenberg said one concern people have about the overturn of Roe v. Wade is that restrictive states may prohibit people from receiving an abortion in another state. Currently, the Court has not recognized the right to travel or right to privacy under the Constitution because they, like the right to abortion, are not enumerated rights — which are explicitly written in the Constitution — making these rights vulnerable, Stolzenberg said.
“Even if the court says there is a right to travel, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to agree that making people criminally liable, or civilly liable for that matter, for doing something when they travel is an infringement on the right to travel,” Stolzenberg said. “These are completely novel, open questions.” 
Mark Haddad, an adjunct lecturer of law at the Gould School of Law, said the Supreme Court’s majority ruling indicates only enumerated rights as constitutionally protected under originalist views. Originalism, a theory of interpretation in law holding that rights should be interpreted as they were understood at the time of their adoption, says judges should consult frameworkers’ original meaning of the law to deliberate new cases. While the philosophy of originalism seeks to limit judicial bias, Haddad said the Court’s opinion was “not persuasive” because their reasoning references a time where many people were excluded from the law and barred from lawmaking. 
“Why would we look to a tradition in which women were completely subjugated as a matter of law, in which they could not vote and they could not hold office at the time of the founding of the Constitution?” Haddad said. “Why would we look to that tradition and ask about whether it’s a reasonable guide, in this century, to decide whether to recognize this right [to abortion]?”
Although unenumerated rights, such as the right to contraception, interracial marriage and same-sex relationships, are based on years of precedent from prior Courts, Haddad said the repeal leaves all unenumerated rights “vulnerable.” Haddad said he hopes to see the Court revisit Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that repealed Roe, and constitute a right to bodily autonomy under equality based arguments. The Court did something similar in Skinner v. Oklahoma, when they decided Skinner, a male prisoner, couldn’t be sterilized under the Equal Protection Clause because there was interference with procreative autonomy, in turn establishing the right to procreation as fundamental.   
If unenumerated rights continue to be dismantled by the Court under originalist views, Haddad said, the Court’s logic sets the law back to the ages of American colonial society.
“The arguments for the right for women or other pregnant persons to decide whether to carry the pregnancy to term are not just liberty or privacy rights, the way Roe talked about them, but they’re also rights of equality [and] being an equal member of the society,” Haddad said. “If the courts are not prepared to do that … you may as well just think in terms of reestablishing the law of the agrarian republic that the United States was in, in the late 18th century.”
There is currently no explicit written right to privacy in the Constitution, which leaves this unenumerated right susceptible to amendment by judges — who will decide the cases dealing with the repeal’s aftermath — as more post-Roe cases emerge in the next few years. For example, if a state chooses to pass laws making it illegal to receive medications in the mail and if a state sets up any kind of enforcement apparatus that involves monitoring people’s online communications and mail, there will be controversy over what grounds states have to impose these rules, Stolzenberg said. 
“I think the concerns about privacy and the sense of being subject to surveillance for your online purchases, communications and purchases of medications is just one of numerous examples of new areas of legal dispute that are bound to open up in the wake of this decision,” Stolzenberg said.
The emerging legal controversy indicates that the majority opinion’s claims in Dobbs generated controversy, political divisiveness, social unrest and endless legal conflict, and the suggestion that the overturn of Roe will “calm the legal waters down” isn’t going to happen, Stolzenberg said. 
“I think the very opposite [of what the majority opinion claimed] is what’s going to happen,” Stolzenberg said. “[The country] is far from settling anything … there’s going to be far more litigation, far more legal disputation, far more uncertainty, far more chaos.”
Cynthia Sanchez, a clinical assistant professor of nursing and clinical placement director at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, hypothesized that abortions will occur later in pregnancies because of the added obstacles of making appointments out of state, funding travel, taking time off work and more. Sanchez said it’s “scary,” to see the possibility of people resorting to various forms of illegal abortions and predicted that the overturn will increase the national maternal mortality rate. 
“Abortions, like any other aspect of health care, are regulated,” Sanchez said. “They have standards that they have to meet, [including] standards of equipment, standards of training of the providers, standards of how you’re going to get treated and how many people need to be in the room. If you go to another random person on the street … you’re just trusting that they’re going to do it right.” 
To travel and receive an abortion in a non-restrictive state is a privilege of wealth, Sanchez said, as wealthier individuals may have the financial resources to fly to another state and afford a few days away from work. Impoverished people seeking abortions — historically and predominantly people of color — are going to be disproportionately impacted by travel expenses, the expense of the procedure and the added task of asking to take time off work to attend an appointment. 
Residents of states with restrictive abortion laws — such as Texas and Alabama — who are capable of becoming pregnant will need to travel greater distances, Sanchez said, to seek legal, safe abortions in non-restrictive states, which will contribute to more late-term pregnancy terminations.
“For women [with money] that have a problem, they can fly and go to New York or California and get their procedure done,” Sanchez said. “But the other women, where it’s going to be a three-day trip [to drive] and … they have to ask for the time or for work, they have to do all these things, so now it’s going to take longer.”
The University makes available a variety of mental and physical supports for students who are survivors of gender-based harm and sexual violence, and who may be looking to obtain an abortion. Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said the University has a “really important” role to play in preventing gender-based harm and supporting students who have experienced it through the Relationship and Sexual Violence Protection services, which provides an advocate team for confidential 24/7 response to situations including sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking through the line. 
The Engemann and Eric Cohen Student Health Centers also offer an array of ambulatory health care services, including via Telehealth for patients not presently in the state of California. Medication abortion services and the entirety of in-clinic care, including ultrasound, are included in the USC Student Health Fee, and Student Health also provides referrals for students to receive surgical services off-campus.
If you are in need of support, here are some resources you can contact:
USC Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services: Located at Engemann Student Health Center Suite 356. Individuals can call (213)-740-9355 and request to speak with an advocate or counselor. Services are confidential.

I would imagine that this is not that profound a thought, but if I know anything to be true, it is that good sex is like good music is like good drugs. And nothing else comes close.
I understand things as synonyms, metaphors and romantically drawn out comparisons with too many words and specifications and very few commas like how people from California speak and think and live. Train of consciousness, I guess. 
They tell you to write about what you know. 
I understand some things about being first-generation, the heartbreak after a parent is deported, the physical toll from your first love leaving. I’m more than proficiently versed in knee surgeries and have six years of piano in my brain somewhere. I can adequately write HTML and I’m still learning how to be a big sister. I just signed up for a drumming class. 
Though, nothing in the world is better understood in whatever part of my brain understands these things as is sex, drugs and Spotify. 
As a kid, I used to read a lot and then I started writing a lot and then I stopped reading and then I stopped writing. And then I found myself in hatchback cars and at smoke-stained elementary school parks listening to music better than everyone else. 
There is less backseat promiscuity, less makeshift bongs. They’ve upgraded to singles with back entrances, and I’m still pretty broke so an extra apple can be handy but there’s definitely more drugs. The music has remained. 
Many years of mine have been spent trying to find the right words to describe the (for lack of a better word) drug that is music. There are no words, only a lot of likes and a little too much context. 
They also tell you to be specific in journalism class and that you can’t use words like “many years” when talking about a Fact, but if there’s anything I don’t know, it’s time. My memory is not marked like calendar days but maybe if there was one of those songs playing, I can relive it again. 
“the afterglow” EP by blackbear was playing when I fell for my friend in middle school. “Body Party” by Ciara brings me back to smoking in bushes and sneaking into unsupervised trailer homes. “1st Position” by Kehlani (and actually all of “Cloud 19”) gave my little queer self some grounding in the Bay Area. 
“Come Through and Chill” by Miguel is foggy windows at Heritage Oaks Park with the lacrosse player I guess I lost my virginity to. Whenever Carti’s self-titled plays, I’m immediately transported back to riding shotgun in beemers with boys with DUIs. “Amphetamine” by Smino is when I decided this is all I care about. 
My greatest memories are pretty orange prescription bottles filled to the brim with soft neck kisses. They are lies coated in intimacy, nicotine rips fueled by bated breaths. My life is tracked by over a hundred playlists (since I was graciously gifted Spotify Premium one Christmas) and the list in my Notes app that I assume we all have. Mine also has their astrological signs. 
Now, I never said I was an expert on anything — I don’t believe in those — but I have accumulated enough encounters and experiences that have provided me with some stories to share. 
Whether it’s rolling at a concert or sharing cigarettes after sex, life for me, and maybe some of you, is driven by moments where everything seemingly bad feels seemingly good. 
I began at this publication as a staffer with high hopes to write for the Arts & Entertainment section and then proceeded to not write once. I found my way to News, became section editor for our two entirely online semesters and learned more about this University than I wished. And then I left.
During my hiatus, I picked up a music industry minor and refocused my efforts toward MASH Magazine, a business of fashion journal established at USC by two amazing people who took me on to run editorial. You should read our stuff. 
Despite every intention of not returning to the fourth floor newsroom, I was offered the chance to edit A&E for just two months last Fall and fell back into the late nights and nonstop Slack notifications. I still wasn’t writing a lot. 
Last semester as associate managing editor, I made a lot of what you might consider to be mistakes. I spent my days high and found a smoke shop that didn’t card if I smiled at the guy behind the counter. I had a lot of sex with people that mattered too much (read: didn’t matter at all). I crossed lines that have been blurred in my head for quite some time and realized my past traumas still weren’t healed. 
But I don’t consider these mistakes anymore. 
Writing what you know feels self-important but that’s because it is, I guess. 
Admittedly, it required great restraint to not type out an alarming amount of concessions and apologize profusely for the ego of this column. I have no time to fill in the gaps — you either get it or you don’t.
I’ve come to learn that when your brain runs a mile a minute and you approach everything as a critiquing editor — even before you have a right to — you tend to gravitate not towards slower pacing or refined works, but to spaces where the chaos doesn’t feel like a bad thing anymore.
I don’t desire decency. I want to be blown away.
They tell you to write about what you know. I’m writing again. You should listen to “Floyd” by Kelis on “Food.” 
Ana Mata is a senior writing about everything related to promiscuity and playlists. She is also the managing editor of the Daily Trojan.

On June 24, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled to overturn the landmark court case Roe v. Wade, marking the end of nearly 50 years of reproductive freedom in the nation. The decision returned the question of how to regulate abortion to the states, which can now legislate to ban or protect abortion access as they wish. The fate of reproductive access lies upon elected officials advocating for “pro-life” or “pro-choice” agendas and the donors that fund their efforts. 
The 34 members of the USC Board of Trustees are employed and retired corporate executives, as well as industry and community leaders who wield a great deal of influence, both within and outside of the University. As a self-perpetuating body, the Board of Trustees governs the University and serves as the “ultimate decision-making body,” according to University policy. A majority of the Trustees regularly make donations to political campaigns, elected officials and party committees that hold the political power to alter the course of protected rights and liberties for their constituents.
Through the use of public political donation records, the Daily Trojan has compiled a data set of the contributions Trustees made to politicians and parties since web records began in the early 2000s. This article is not meant as an attack on the Trustees’ political donations and views, but as a way to inform the University community on their political expenditure.
It is important to note that it is unclear as to whether Trustees considered a candidate’s or elected official’s stance on reproductive rights when making their donation, so information presented here should not be taken as each Trustee’s definitive view on the issue. Trustees’ independent, personal political donations are not affiliated to their role as Board members; thus, the Daily Trojan was unable to obtain comment from the Board about this article.
Methodology
To conduct this investigation, donations were verified with the National Institute on Money in Politics and Open Secrets. Both are nonpartisan, nonprofit organizations promoting transparency for donations made regarding U.S. politics, including campaign donors and lobbyists. We surveyed donations from Board of Trustees members, as well as the companies and organizations they are associated with if the Trustee currently holds an executive position within the organization.
The compiled list is not exhaustive — it includes the largest donations for each Trustee, and only those donations greater than $999 were included. Furthermore, only donations made to winning campaigns were included — exceptions were made in cases where donations to losing campaigns were among the largest for the donor. 
Donations were verified on both organizations used during the research process, but donations only listed on one of them are marked with an asterisk. A full raw set of the data can be found here.
Analysis
Alumna and real estate professional Stephanie A. Argyros has been a member of the Board since 2018. Argyros is a principal at Arnel, a real estate firm, and serves as director of the Argyros Family Foundation. Argyros has donated $7,400 to elected officials working to restrict access to abortion services — including a $10,000* donation made to Butch Otter by Arnel Development.
Marc R. Benioff is chair, co-CEO and co-founder of Salesforce. A member of the Board since 2011 and a member of the USC Marshall School of Business Board of Councilors, Benioff has contributed $164,400 to campaigns for candidates who support reproductive rights and $57,300 to ones who work to restrict them. The day Roe v. Wade was overturned, Benioff Tweeted that he “believes CEOs have a responsibility to take care of their employees — no matter what. Salesforce moves employees when they feel threatened or experience discrimination.”
A member of the Board since 2020, Corii D. Berg serves as the executive vice president and general counsel of Lionsgate Entertainment. He also served as president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors. Berg does not have any publicly listed donations to political campaigns.
Chairman of Chaparal Investments and member of the Board of Councilors of the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Robert D. Beyer joined the Board in 2021. Beyer has contributed $114,000 to politicians working to preserve reproductive rights and $135,507 to politicians working to restrict them.
David C. Bohnett has been a member of the Board since 2015. Bohnett also serves as chair of the David Bohnett Foundation, which is “committed to improving society through social activism.” Bohnett has donated $221,500 to politicians who work to protect reproductive freedoms.
Amgen CEO Robert A. Bradway has been a member of the Board since 2014. Bradway has donated $317,123 to campaigns supporting elected officials in favor of protecting reproductive rights — including a $152,923* donation to Gray Davis (D) made by Amgen — and $175,400 to officials against it.
Former Chair of the Board and current L.A. mayoral candidate Rick J. Caruso Tweeted that he is “heartbroken and outraged by the decision of the Supreme Court,” referring to the repeal of Roe. He has contributed $185,300 to officials working to protect reproductive rights and $53,100 to officials working to bar them.
Chairman of the board of the Herrick Corporation David H. Dornsife has been a member of the Board since 2002. Dornsife has donated $14,500 to campaigns supporting officials in favor of reproductive rights and $83,200 to officials against them.
A member of the Board since 2012, Michele Dedeaux Engemann is a philanthropist and actor. She has previously served as president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors and is a Founding Chair of the USC School of Dramatic Arts. Engemann does not have any public donations to political campaigns.
Michael A. Felix is a retired financial services professional. He served as the 95th president of the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors and has been a Board member since 2019. Felix has no listed political donations.

Concluding thoughts
While the state of California has upheld that it will protect access to reproductive healthcare, students hailing from every state come to the University. Thus, policy-making in every state concerns the student population, especially during academic recess, when students often return home. 
The University’s leaders and their contributions to politicians and campaigns working to protect reproductive rights or restrict abortion access should be kept in plain sight for the University community.

Former Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work dean Sarah Gehlert left her position effective Aug. 1, Provost Charles Zukoski and Senior Vice President for Health Affairs Steven D. Shapiro announced in an email to the USC social work community July 21.
“We write today to share with you that Sarah Gehlert has informed us of her decision to end her tenure as Dean of the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, effective August 1, 2022,” the email read. “Please join us in thanking her for guiding the School over the past two years.”
Gehlert’s decision marks the end of her two-year tenure as dean, which started April 2020 after an extensive search to replace former Dean Marilyn Louise Flynn. Flynn was removed from the role in September 2018, after which in 2019 she was indicted on bribery charges alongside former Los Angeles City Councilmember Mark Ridley-Thomas. USC announced Gehlert as the new dean in January 2020, replacing interim Dean Suzanne Wenzel.
Gehlert’s career spans decades: After earning her Ph.D. at Washington University in St. Louis in 1991, she continued her work on health disparities and community-based research. From 2003 to 2007, she served as deputy dean for research at the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration; from 2011 to 2016, the director of the Center Community Engaged Research at the WashU St. Louis Institutes for Clinical and Translational Sciences; then from 2017 to 2019, dean of the University of South Carolina College of Social Work. She has also served on several editorial boards and advisory committees, and as a member of the White House Health Equity Leaders Roundtable during her tenure at USC.
The Daily Trojan was unable to reach Gehlert for comment.
In the 16 months it took to search for and appoint Gehlert, Dworak-Peck underwent a tumultuous period, having been heavily criticized for its budgetary issues and admissions scandals. The Los Angeles Times reported in May 2019 that the school was operating at a projected deficit of $40 million by the end of the next fiscal year, and allegations surfaced that the school was compensating for the deficit by lowering its admissions standards. 
Zukoski and Shapiro wrote in their email that since Gehlert’s arrival, “her steady leadership through the grave challenges of that time helped Social Work reestablish forward momentum.”
Under Gehlert’s leadership, the school has since developed the Integrative Social Work master’s program, the lower credit and cost of which aims to reduce debt burdens for students aiming for a master’s degree in the field. The school also became the primary sponsor of the Trojan Guardian Scholars, which aims to provide a supportive network for current and former foster youth attending USC.
In a separate statement to the Daily Trojan, Zukoski said Gehlert “came to us and shared her decision to return to Missouri with her spouse. We are grateful for the vital work she has done for the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and our university community.”
USC School of Pharmacy dean Vassilios Papadopoulos will serve as Dworak-Peck’s interim dean until a new dean is found. Gehlert will continue to serve as professor emeritus at WashU St. Louis.
A previous version of this article stated that former Dean Marilyn Louise Flynn was involved in the “Operation Varsity Blues” scandal. It was updated at 10:00 p.m. Aug. 17 to clarify that Flynn was indicted on bribery charges in an incident separate from “Varsity Blues.” The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Finding new music can be hard, but our resident students and alumni are here for you with hits they dropped this past summer. From pop to smooth R&B to indie, we have curated some tracks that will have your friends covertly Shazam-ing every time you have the aux. 
“Juno (Deluxe)” by Remi Wolf
Remi Wolf, bedroom pop darling and USC Thornton School of Music graduate, released the deluxe version of her debut album, Juno, in June, featuring an additional five new tracks as well as a live performance of the track “Street You Live On.” “Cake,” in particular, stands out as a hyperpop-adjacent entry that makes you feel like you’re in a video game as Wolf pleads with an unrequited love. With widespread acclaim, unique vocals and fun melodies, Wolf cements herself as one to watch on the pop scene and the perfect addition to your end-of-summer rotation. 
“Before I Prosper” by Ayoni 
Also in June, Ayoni released the track “Before I Prosper” as a follow-up to single “You Said I Love You Too Soon,” both of which will be featured on her upcoming EP to be released later in August. “Before I Prosper” highlights Ayoni’s vocal prowess and beautiful sound and employs evocative imagery as she belts, “I won’t bleed for your love, I won’t bleed.”  Look for her alongside other big names such as The Roots, HAIM and The War On Drugs at The Big Climate Thing Festival in mid-September.
“Are You Happy Now” by Jensen McRae
Released this past March, this spring album by another  Thornton alumna is a pop/R&B/rock triumph that has led to critics drawing comparisons to the legendary Tracy Chapman. Remember that viral tweet that said, “in 2023 Phoebe Bridgers is gonna drop her third album & the opening track will be about hooking up in the car while waiting in line to get vaccinated at dodger stadium and it’s gonna make me cry” with an accompanying video predicting what it would sound like?” Yeah, that’s her. Check out “Immune” to hear a studio version of the homage to Bridgers.
“This Job” by Kabwasa
Kabwasa has kept his fans well fed with single after single this summer. Starting with the releases of “To Be A Star” on May 26 and “This Job” on July 1 and with yet another track on the horizon — “How U Feelin” is slated for release Aug. 19 — Kabwasa is making sure his 44,000 Spotify listeners always have something new to listen to. Check out his TikTok while you’re at it, he’s hilarious.
“MUNA” by MUNA
If “Silk Chiffon” isn’t already on your summer playlist what are you doing? MUNA — another act with a conspicuous connection to Phoebe Bridgers (they’re under her record label) — met at USC and have been reaching greater and greater success ever since. The band was first introduced to a wider audience once pop star Harry Styles enlisted them for his very first tour post-One Direction. Releasing tracks about queer love and relationships to widespread acclaim, MUNA is only getting bigger and it doesn’t look like they’ll be hitting the breaks any time soon. 
“Reminisce on Innocence” by Lily Forte
Forte serenades listeners with a voice that invites comparisons to the likes of Amy Winehouse. The sultry track is the perfect angsty rock track to round out this list. It’s the perfect song for belting in your car or in your room after a particularly frustrating romantic encounter. The backing rock instrumental reminiscent of early 2000s pop rock jams make this the perfect nostalgic hit that can bring you back to the past.

The Department of Public Safety has extended its search for a new leader, with applications for the role of assistant vice president/chief of public safety — a change from the previous title, executive director/chief of public safety — being accepted until the end of August. The search, which began following former DPS Chief John Thomas’ retirement Jan. 12, was narrowed down to two finalists in April and an appointment was set to be made in May. 
Interim DPS Chief David Carlisle has served in the role since Jan. 13 and will continue to do so until an appointment for the permanent position is made, said Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance Dr. Erroll Southers in an interview with the Daily Trojan. The updated position was posted July 5 and the extended timeline for the appointment now stipulates that a final candidate will be chosen by mid- to late November. 
The decision to change the position title, Southers said, was made partly as a way to keep pace with titles of public safety leader positions at other universities and to broaden the applicant field. Many previous candidates in the search, he said, were assistant vice presidents of comparable departments — UCLA recently appointed a new assistant vice chancellor of environment, health & safety; a chief of public safety oversees campus safety at Chapman University, and NYU appointed in 2016 a vice president for global campus safety. 
“One of the things that prompted the change was we were hoping that we might attract individuals who transitioned from public safety to university administration oversight of these areas,” Southers said, noting himself as an example of this career trajectory — Southers began his career in law enforcement at the Santa Monica Police Department, later working at the FBI and in the California Office of Homeland Security, as a USC professor and now within the University administration.
The 22-person search committee, consisting of students, staff, faculty and neighborhood stakeholders, will revamp the process of identifying and screening candidates in September. Interviews with executive level leadership will be conducted earlier on in the process this time around, Southers said, in September and October, before candidates are brought to the full search committee. A town hall will be held in October that will again present two top candidates, similarly as was done in April at two Finalist Community Input Sessions.
The responsibilities falling under the leadership position will not change despite the position’s new title, Southers said, but the process will emphasize regulatory issues as they relate to Clery Act — which requires universities to report campus crime data, support victims of violence and publicly outline safety policies — on Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX.
“We want to make sure that that person is steeped in that area, and then some operational challenges,” Southers said. “We faced the same challenge as many public safety entities across the country — municipal and campus — in terms of recruiting, retention and getting people on board, so those are things we want to make sure that someone is able to address and have some experience doing that.”
Deliberations on new candidates did not continue over the summer, but a subcommittee met and discussed lessons learned and input received during the earlier search. 
“We could take advantage of the fact that we had all that valuable information from previous community input sessions we could use, so we eliminated having to do that again,” Southers said. “We’ll go forward now with a more streamlined and, hopefully, seamless process going forward.”

As school starts up again, I have to remind everyone not to forget the best part of summer: the bops. I love summer songs as much as the next person. In fact, for the most part, music is how I define summer.
The summer after my freshman year of high school, I listened to Twenty One Pilots’ “Ride” and Drake’s “One Dance” (featuring WizKid and Kyla) on repeat while attending an exchange program in France. To this day, my memories of the Paris airport are inextricably tied to those two songs. Summer 2017 meant having pop hit “Back to You” from Louis Tomlinson (featuring Bebe Rexha and Digital Farm Animals) on repeat in the dorm room of my summer program. 
This summer, I listened to a lot of Dua Lipa — more specifically, “Levitating,” the “Cold Heart” PNAU remix with Elton John and the comparatively underrated “Hallucinate.” By virtue of being on repeat almost all the time, Dua Lipa became my pop queen of the summer. Following my tendency to fall into the deep dark YouTube hole after discovering something that I even remotely like, I ended up on a Dua Lipa music video marathon. 
After watching way more Dua Lipa videos than I should have, I discovered that there was one element that really exemplified her role as a musical “artist”: the use of animation to vivify her music and tell a story. 
Just look at the official video for Dua Lipa’s “Physical” (arguably my favorite Dua song, but who’s asking?). Interspersed throughout the live-action footage of Dua Lipa dancing are various animation images reminiscent of old cartoons, such as an animated version of Dua Lipa playing around with superpowers to a pulsing animated heart. 
“Hallucinate” is another one of these music videos where animation fits perfectly into the meaning of the music. Since the lyrics of the song are about diving headfirst into a fantasy, Dua uses animation as a medium to convey a message about the “hallucinations” of a romantic relationship. 
The fully animated video follows a version of Dua Lipa journeying through various bizarre landscapes, literally driving the point home of “Hallucinate,” with the video feeling like a hallucination itself. Doors open one after another and the Dua Lipa cartoon multiplies. Backup dancers with stars for heads swirl around the dancing Dua Lipa. Dancing eggplants and grooving unicorn cartoons also make their appearance. The whole video just feels like an incredibly out-of-body experience, and it’s a thrilling adventure. 
The “Levitating” animated video features Dua Lipa paying homage to her inspiration: Sailor Moon. From the art style to the galactic content, “Levitating” is Dua Lipa’s take on the iconic anime, one that’s specific to the lyrics of her music. In this case, the pop star is given the qualities of a superhero, as if the video is reminding us that pop music has its own magic. Similar to that of “Hallucinate,” Dua Lipa and Elton John’s “Cold Heart” music video is also an eclectic mix of visuals, with animated versions of the singers coupled with stop-motion dancers and solar system imagery.
While Dua Lipa’s use of animation in her music has been my go-to for the summer, she’s not the only star that’s demonstrated her appreciation for the art form. Billie Eilish’s live concert experience, “Happier than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles,” is a concert film that combines both animated sequences with live on-stage performances. 
True to the title of the film being a “love letter to L.A.,” an animated version of Billie Eilish explores the city in between each performance. This integration of an animated character is an awe-inspiring way of looking at the city through the lens of its romanticization. 
In the film’s trailer, Eilish states that she definitely has “fantasies about L.A.,” explaining how the film is more than a concert film, but a narrative about the “idealized version” of herself.” With animation to depict this “idealized” self, Eilish successfully crafts a story that goes along with her music. Animation is really about creating an alternative version of reality, and the “Happier than Ever” film shows that with its animated elements. 
To see the real Billie meet the animated Billie at the end of the concert feels like a merging of two worlds. It’s a beautifully humane way of reckoning with the fantasies of L.A. while simultaneously dealing with the depth of Eilish’s own experiences growing up in the city. Once again, animation is able to effectively illustrate the divisions of the self, as well as their ultimate reconciliation. 
Animation is a powerful tool for storytelling, and it’s obvious that musical artists are responding to that by integrating animation into their music videos. The more that artists in all disciplines start noticing animation as a way of telling their stories, the more that animation can truly take us out of this world.

Dear President Folt:
Although I am proud to be a Trojan and grateful for the positive changes you have brought to the university, there are undoubtedly many areas still open for improvement at USC. I am writing to you and the readers of the Daily Trojan to express my concern about the active ban of pepper spray on campus.
In 2017, former USC Public Information Officer and current Interim Chief of the Department of Public Safety David Carlisle told reporters at Annenberg Media, “The University has a no weapons policy and that includes pepper spray … Pepper spray is generally considered a defensive weapon, which is also prohibited on campus.” This policy differs significantly from other schools in surrounding areas, such as UCLA and Pepperdine, which both allow students to carry pepper spray as a self-defense mechanism in compliance with California law. 
As in many big cities, students and residents in Los Angeles are at high risk of encountering crime. Homicide rates hit a decade-long high in 2021 and vehicle thefts, robberies and property crime have also spiked over the last few years. However, on campus, students have the additional fear of experiencing another heinous act of violence: sexual assault.
In the past, you have expressed anger towards sexual violence at USC and compassion for victims, specifically in response to the Sigma Nu sexual assault allegations and the abuse inflicted by former Student Health physican Dr. George Tyndall. You were right in stating that these events have been devastating for our community. Provost Charles Zukoski also issued a heartfelt letter to USC faculty expressing sincere empathy for my peers who have been impacted by sexual assault at USC, calling it “abhorrent criminal behavior that is unacceptable at our university.” As a former Greek Life member and a former student-athlete, I deeply appreciate the administration’s stance and the efforts you have made thus far to combat sexual assault on campus. However, students need to be given access to tangible resources in order to break the perpetual cycle of vicious assault in our community. 
Unfortunately, currently implemented prevention tactics for sexual assault, such as mandated workshop training and supportive hotlines, are ineffective. As you know, cases of sexual assault at USC are disproportionately high compared to other universities. At USC, 1 in 3 women will be assaulted, as opposed to the national average of 1 in 4. I acknowledge that the issue of sexual assault on campus is complex, and there is no single solution we can pursue. However, USC is one of the few universities to place a ban on self-defense weapons that could give students the opportunity to defend themselves and potentially deter sexual assault. 
While the USC community values the transparency offered by Department of Public Safety Crime Alerts and Annual Safety Reports, the reality is that the number of sex-related crimes occurring on and near campus is unsettling. In the 2021 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report released by USC, there were a total of 32 sex offenses reported in 2017, 203 offenses in 2018, 86 offenses in 2019, and 37 offenses in 2020 (when most students were only on campus for about two months of the calendar year). In addition to sexual assault, aggravated assault reportedly occurred 21 times in 2017, 25 times in 2018, 26 times in 2019 and 17 times in 2020. 
All universities have a legal obligation to protect students from foreseeable crime, as determined by Stanton v. University of Maine System, Mullins v. Pine Manor College, The Clery Act, amended by The Federal Campus Sexual Assualt Victim’s Bill of Rights, and more. In essence, these cases decided that because of the frequency of occurrence, sexual assault is a foreseeable crime on campuses, and universities must be transparent when it comes to reporting crime-related data. By banning pepper spray, USC is not only neglecting its duty to protect its students but also perpetuating  the attitude that sexual assault is something that “just happens.” Lifting the ban is one step away from complacency.
A pro-pepper spray policy could lower the risk of sexual assault and protect students from falling victim to other types of crimes, such as robbery and battery, even if the students are not formally trained on the use of pepper spray. It is immediately incapacitating, allowing defenders to ward off attackers, but the short-term effects wear off in time, making it a safe defensive weapon for students to carry on campus, as there are incredibly rare instances in which pepper spray has been lethal. Some also believe that encouraging students to carry pepper spray for defensive purposes could inspire those with malicious intentions to bring pepper spray on campus. A person who wishes to attack students with pepper spray or any other weapon will not be deterred by a universal ban; however, they may be deterred knowing that students have self-defense tools on them at all times.
It is past time that our university implement action to stop sexual assualt on campus. Please consider lifting the ban on pepper spray and working with Interim DPS Chief Carlisle to actively encourage students to carry pepper spray at all times before classes begin on Aug. 22. 
Sincerely,
Molly Davis

Every week for “Organic Chemistry”, I spent three hours in lecture, three hours in lab and one hour in supplemental instruction. For another course, I spent only three hours in class, yet somehow both classes hold identical weight on transcripts.
It is important to note that every class is unique. However, it is evident that there should be some formal acknowledgment that many lab courses at USC are more demanding by virtue of their additional periods and subsequent at-home work, so it is only fair that students are given credit for this extra time. This change would require the rearranging of course schedules and graduation requirements, but USC should recognize the extra demands of these classes and accredit them by increasing their unit count.
While not all lab classes are going to demand the same amount of time, and not all lecture-only classes are going to be less demanding than those with labs, none of my non-lab classes come close to the demand that my STEM lab courses have called for.
I am not suggesting that any non-lab or non-STEM classes are easier, as I, of course, have not taken every class at USC. This being said, I do have a combined humanities and science major and an engineering minor, and I have taken almost 30 classes at USC (and 10 classes at another university) and my lab courses at USC still hold the highest rank for the most painstaking hours I’ve spent on a course. Sure, classes at USC are meant to be rigorous and challenge its intelligent students, but the distinction between a difficult class and unfair accreditation lies in the doubled amount of time spent in classrooms and the additional assignments and exams. 
Giving credit for only one class when students are expected to attend both a lecture and a lab, perform separate weekly assignments and study for unique exams, is misleading and unfair to say the least.
USC defines one “unit” as being equivalent to 12.5 contact hours per 15-week semester. For a four-unit class (50 contact hours for the semester), this equates to three to four hours of in-class instruction per week. For many STEM classes, lecture and lab attendance is mandatory to pass, and each accounts for about three hours. The number of units equivalent to the six hours this course requires should — by definition — be seven units but this also disregards the recommended two hours of work per unit done outside of class by the University. 
Although I cannot speak for everyone about the time spent studying for these classes, 14 hours of studying a week does not seem far off. Both the lecture section and the lab section have their own at-home work, tests and final, essentially making them two different classes. Academic intensity aside, the fact alone that the lecture and lab could stand as two separate courses should be enough to make people question the credit USC gives for these classes.
Putting extra weight on lab classes is nothing out of the ordinary. Other top universities such as UCSD, UCLA, NYU, Vanderbilt and Stanford all weigh their lab classes differently from non-lab classes. Some schools, such as NYU, choose to combine the lecture and lab for more units, while others, such as Vanderbilt, count lab as a separate one-unit class. Although their methods vary, at least they acknowledge the differences in demand that these courses possess. USC must do the same.
One concern with these proposed changes is that putting more weight on these classes will negatively affect students’ GPA, but with fewer courses, students can focus more on each of their classes. If a student is taking four four-unit classes, with one being a lab course, they are essentially taking 19 units, which even the University doesn’t recommend. 
Now imagine if two of those courses were labs; 22 units is so discouraged that it requires special approval from the school. ` the other hand, if a student registered for a seven-unit lab course, tuition would only cover two other four-unit classes. This ensures that students can maximize their tuition without overloading their schedules.  Not only would this system more appropriately adhere to the University’s suggested contact hours, but it would also give students enough time to study for their courses.
This change would require some adjustments on the University and its students, as restructuring a whole section of courses is tedious. This would need to be a compromise between adding units to the major and removing some of the courses, but this level of change is nothing new. In 2015, USC made GE changes that affected all undergraduate schools, students and faculty. As a student who started at USC in 2019, these changes feel seamless and the University seems well-adjusted. The updates that I propose wouldn’t even be this drastic, as it would only affect a fraction of the University.
Students deserve the credit they have worked for. Last semester, I took 20 units of classes, none of which were a lab course, and yet I spent half as much time studying and doing assignments compared to semesters when I had just one lab course. Being a student is hard enough as it is, but being a student without getting any credit for it is unfair and far worse.

Growing up with two generations of Japanese Americans who were incarcerated during World War II, I was excited to hear about President Carol Folt’s decision to dedicate a rock garden to the USC Nisei students — children of Japanese immigrants who were forced into incarceration camps and whose education was stripped from them, as they were not allowed to complete their degrees after the war. However, as I strolled into the new rock garden and admired its lush greenery and beauty, I couldn’t help but look around for the dedication plaque – one that officially dedicates this section of campus to honoring the Nisei students – but I couldn’t find it. 
Puzzled, I took a closer look at the kanji engraved on the beautiful rock by the entrance with its translation below,  “On a stone for three years – A Japanese Proverb.” 
This phrase immediately reminded me of the war that entrapped my ancestors in incarceration camps for nearly three years from 1942 to 1945, but the true meaning of the proverb still escaped me. In hopes of discovering its established meaning, I turned to Google. Some sources stated that the proverb teaches how “perseverance wins in the end and that endurance is a virtue” while others mentioned it’s a “lesson in patience: three years sitting on a cold stone will eventually make it warm.” 
In talking to one of my peers, Justin Abe, a USC Japanese language alumnus, I discovered another meaning to the proverb: if one has the discipline to sit on a stone for three years, nothing can stop them from doing anything else. 
Although I admire the ode to Japanese culture that the kanji inscribed on the rock represents, I became disheartened, as the meaning of the garden is subjective to the beholder and does not explain the true reason for its existence: the University’s attempt to right their wrongdoings of unjustly prohibiting all Nissei students from continuing their studies after the war.
The space is intended to be a dedication to the University’s 121 Nisei students whose education was wrongfully taken away. Calvin Abe, the garden’s architect, constructed it to be a reflective and meaningful space that is “symbolic of a return” for the Nisei scholars who were never allowed to finish their studies almost 80 years ago. But without a dedication plaque or even some reference to that context: Is this garden really a memorial to the Nisei students? According to the architect, “the garden is a place to relax and reconsider what happened in the past, an expression of perseverance and hope.” As it is currently, visitors won’t know to reconsider the University’s tainted past, to them the garden will just be another pretty place to relax on campus.
It’s admirable that in addition to erecting the rock garden, President Folt provided Nisei scholars with posthumous honorary degrees and a formal apology at the Asian Pacific Association gala last April. This recognition came twelve years after the Japanese American Citizens League passed a resolution that urged USC to award honorary degrees to the Nisei and eleven years after a student-run coalition called the Nisei Diploma Project at USC sought to achieve this acknowledgment. With this, the University has finally caught up with several other California universities that have already issued honorary degrees to Nisei students in the past few decades.
At San Francisco State, there is another memorialized garden in honor of former Nisei students. Their Garden of Remembrance honors the 19 students who were robbed of their degrees and features a plaque that provides historical information about the Japanese American incarceration and their affected Nisei students. In their dedication ceremony, San Francisco State said that they created the garden as a “beautiful and inspiring memorial [that] will stand on this diverse and international-minded campus as a permanent reminder of past errors and future commitment to the values we need to sustain our nation and our shared global society.” 
USC must follow this example. I’d like to believe that we didn’t just build a garden to build a garden, but rather that we erected this symbolic and significant space to publicly acknowledge and honor our Nisei students. In order to formally honor them, the rock garden must include a section that explicitly lays out the history and meaning of this space so that all visitors can understand and grasp the importance of this area. 
USC needs to do more than just say that the rock garden is a dedication to its Nisei students. The University must acknowledge its former wrongs permanently. A one-time speech at a gala and a vague proverb that provides outsiders with no context for why the space exists is not enough. The Nisei students deserve a plaque and USC must give it to them.

Last year, Florida’s banning of critical race theory — a legal framework that argues racism is embedded in our nation’s most important structures — in classrooms gained significant media buzz. However, despite tremendous backlash from educators, parents and the general public, several states are riding the wave of the CRT fervor, moving ahead with legislation attacking classroom conversations on LGBTQ+ history, systemic racism and other so-called “divisive topics.” 
The Tennessee state legislature imposed several bans on books discussing race, sexuality and gender, and even threatened to cut state funding to schools that continued discussing systemic racism with their students. Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel Maus, which details the horrors of the Holocaust, was notably banned by a Tennessee school board earlier this year. 
In Texas, the state legislature passed a bill strongly dictating how educators may discuss current events and America’s history of racism to their students last summer. Currently, Texas administrators are working to recontextualize the public school social studies curriculum in an attempt to “make sure that no student comes away from class feeling guilty about the roles of their ancestors.”
A recent UCLA study found that at least 35% of all K-12 students in the United States have been impacted by anti-CRT efforts. These restrictions deter students from honest conversations about history and prevent them from learning about the backgrounds and perspectives of all communities represented in a classroom. 
These educational gag orders not only deny students access to a complete, accurate and inclusive teaching of history, but also stifle teachers’ autonomy in classrooms.
Even in states that have not or are unlikely to pass classroom censorship laws, teachers feel pressured by parents to water down curricula to avoid penalty. Sarah Mulhern Gross, a teacher from New Jersey, was bullied by parents online and accused of trying to “cancel” Shakespeare after discussing the role of toxic masculinity in “Romeo and Juliet.” According to the National Education Association, “The perception that hordes of angry parents are constantly monitoring educators’ every step has a chilling effect in the classroom,” describing the “soft censoring” of classroom discussions.
Much of the fight to sustain the integrity of their curriculum falls squarely on teachers’ shoulders. However, with an ongoing national teachers’ shortage and poor classroom conditions, the added burden of combating censorship laws has teachers spread far too thin. Considering the stress of teaching in exploitative work conditions with few breaks, teachers are left to protect the integrity of their curricula with little to no resources or support.
California has one of the highest teacher shortages in the nation, along with Nevada, Washington, Indiana, Arizona, Hawaii and the District of Columbia. According to the Economic Policy Institute, by 2024, the U.S. can expect a national teacher shortage of up to 200,000 educators.
Desperate, Florida recently authorized military members and their spouses to teach in order to fill teaching vacancies and fulfill select duty requirements. New Mexico has encouraged National Guard members to become licensed substitute teachers, and Arizona recently approved a new law that allows college students to become full-time teachers before completing their bachelor’s degrees.
Aside from the obvious impact of putting less qualified educators in classrooms on students, these desperate measures also devalue teachers’ credentials. Bringing in military personnel and college students to fill teaching vacancies is a temporary solution to an increasingly dire problem. If teaching conditions don’t improve, vacancies will only multiply. Even more so, less qualified teachers are less prepared to withstand the barrage of legislators and parents pushing to teach students a watered down version of history.
However, there is hope. In Indiana, parents and teachers moblized to strike SB-167, a bill that would have banned “the use of supplemental learning materials to promote certain concepts regarding sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.” Despite Indiana’s GOP supermajority, their efforts worked and the bill was pulled from consideration. And, while the victory in Indiana may be an outlier in what seems like a torrent of opposition, it is also a reminder of how impactful it can be to “put pressure on moderate lawmakers, help them come to their senses and see how dangerous these bills are,” said Jonathan Friedman, the director of free expression and education programs at PEN America.
We must support teachers in any way we can if we expect them to fight for our students’ right to a complete, accurate history. About 50% of educators are crippled by student loan debt by the time they sign their first teaching contract. Even 25% of veteran educators over age 61 still owe balances. One idea would be to implement an updated and robust Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program so teachers aren’t drowning in debt. The current program is hopelessly broken, as 98% of those who apply for debt relief are denied.
When it comes to the classroom, our teachers are our greatest warriors, fighting for students’ best interests and defending integrity, truth and curiosity. Our teachers deserve freedom to not only tailor their lessons to meet their students’ needs, but to move forward with providing complete, inclusive and unadulterated education to our students. They deserve autonomy in how they write and implement lesson plans, as well as encouragement to do so to better suit their students’ needs. What we’re seeing now is the tossling of educators in a larger cultural battle, but it is teachers that prepare us to fight them in the first place.
The downright abuse of educators across the country is a huge disservice to young people who are set to inherit a conflicted, polarized and ailing world. Students deserve access to our nation’s full history, and students of various backgrounds have the right to learn about their own cultures and stories, not just ones deemed uncontroversial enough for parents and lawmakers. The manipulation of curricula promotes historical erasure, is racist and shows our kids that it’s okay to ignore a problem if you feel too guilty to face it.

I’d like to start off by admitting that I love to eat. It’s true. There’s nothing more euphoric than the first delicate bite of a Cronut (the shortened name for the croissant-donut sold at the infamous Spudnuts;  can you believe that humankind has developed far enough to create the perfect dessert?) or the late-night $1 birria tacos near Exposition Park. For me, food is much more than a mere life-sustaining nutrition source, but rather a love language and happiness distilled into edible masterpieces.
However, my stomach twisted when I heard in June that the Cardinal Meal Plans were needlessly meddled with. Without an official announcement or notice, USC Hospitality implemented the critical switch of limiting students to its three traditional dining halls. Underneath the high-shine gloss of the word “unlimited,” I found myself gasping at the small print. With the new meal plans, we lose. Not only will students be forced to spend more from eating at on-campus cafés, but could  Hospitality possibly be attempting to siphon a whopping $400 extra on top of the incredibly high costs we had been coerced into paying already? Surely, I thought to myself,  Hospitality knew that 19 meal swipes per week was enough for a majority of the students last semester? The dining habits of students have not and will not change, and  Hospitality knows this.
This isn’t the first time that meal plans have taken advantage of students. In an email this January,  Hospitality announced a reversal in policy that would have restricted students to three meals per day at specific time periods. Taking advantage of incoming freshmen is a low blow, even by the standards of the same people behind the decision to try recreating pho at Parkside Restaurant & Grill. This substantial subset of students with meal plans is being blindsided. 
The reason given on the FAQ section of the  Hospitality website also makes little sense: “Creating communities within the Residential College Experience is an essential part of student life at USC. That is one reason why our Cardinal Meal Plan is anchored in the three residential dining halls and we are delighted to be able to go back to the unlimited Residential Dining meal swipe plans that we had pre-covid.” As Los Angeles County continues to be categorized as high coronavirus activity by federal standards, this push for an increased density in communal spaces is reminiscent of an old, bittered relative on Thanksgiving. Stay home, Uncle Carl.
If you’re anything like me, dining halls were too far to be a daily walk from classes. Ask any Parkside resident, who had to walk 15 minutes every day to classes, if they would prefer to trek back to their dining hall for each meal. I did, and they began to weep profusely at the sheer suggestion that would be a potential predicament. 
Upon analyzing my own dining habits in the past semester, an average of 12 swipes were spent at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and cafés each week. As someone who has formed a deep, personal relationship with the Protein Power smoothie at C&G Juice Co., it’s hard to imagine a future without it. How else would I live out my quirky TikTok micro-influencer fantasy without access to aesthetic acai bowls? The RTCC  food court has always been a haven to students, in the same manner that the Starcourt Mall had been for our favorite “Stranger Things” character, Max Mayfield. Though we may not be running up any hills, the time might be growing near for us to make a deal with God to deliver us from the money-hungry clutches of  Hospitality.
According to the Loyola Marymount University Law School, the South Los Angeles area is currently considered a “food desert,” a term that emphasizes the lack of access to fresh foods and supermarkets, which results in an increase of fast food and liquor stores in our local community. 
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation would often utilize meal-swipe donations to serve members of the local community, but the changes to the Cardinal Meal Plan hinders their ability to do so. 
“So a lot of our unhoused community members relied heavily on those meals every week… and the community really grew to embrace the resources that were coming from such a resource-rich environment like USC, where students were freely giving because their meal plans would not be compounded at the end of the week. We were able to space out deliveries to the fridge to sustain visitors throughout the week,” said Nancy Shao, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering.  “So USC’s decision to nix this meal plan is a huge loss on meal swipe donations to the fridge this year. We’re talking hundreds of meals that the fridge no longer gets and directly obstructs our efforts to meet even the most myopic needs for the community surrounding USC.”
Along with SCALE’s work, similar groups such as Meaningful Meals and Trojans Give Back also feel similar impacts. Our meal swipes have had an amazingly positive impact on a plethora of people, and  Hospitality has effectively limited all of our community-oriented organizations to reclaim these meals as pure profit. Greed isn’t flattering, dear.
Historically, Trojans stood resilient in the face of slimy workings, and it’s our job to get the University experience we signed up (and pay) for. We deserve to have meal plans that serve the students, based on what our needs are. If we’ve been able to overcome the three-meal restrictions, this should be a piece of cake. So, whether you have a steamy obsession with RTCC (like I do) or are looking for an excuse to care about something bigger than just yourself, stop eating your feelings and let them teach you to fight for better from the  Hospitality management. Let us eat cake!

Some people know what job they want from the moment they can speak. They dream of being a scientist or a writer with such conviction that when it comes time to apply to college, they have no doubt about which major they will choose. However, this is not the case for many 18-year-olds, but nonetheless, they are pressured to decide on a major that often dictates their career. 
At USC, students can change their major, but there are restrictions in place that can hold students back from exploring various fields of interest. Certain majors require a student to submit another application separate from the one they completed to be admitted into USC initially in order to make the switch. There are even particular majors that only accept applications once every academic year, an obstacle that can keep students from applying for fear they will fall behind in their current requirements.
As stated on the “Declaring Your Major” section of USC’s website, “Competitive majors require specific prerequisite courses and usually a minimum GPA, but meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission … the competitiveness of the major depends on how many students apply.” 
Language that reinforces the idea of competition undoubtedly hinders a student from applying for fear they are “not good enough.” Not only is an undergraduate pressured to know exactly what they want to do with their life, but they may not be able to pursue it due to competitive barriers.
A study published by the Education Advisory Board found that students who waited to declare their major, even as late as their junior year, were still able to graduate on time in four years. Moreso, despite the fact that about 80% of college students change their major, students are often encouraged to apply to universities under a certain major, even though there is a high likelihood that it will end up changing. 
Students tend to also feel the burden of having to pursue a major that will lead to a fruitful career instead of following their passion. As reported by the University of California at Riverside’s student newspaper, “Oftentimes the ‘perfect’ major is defined as one rooted in the STEM field. Many low-income students attempting to break free from the cycle of poverty hold onto this dream of a STEM degree … However, students forced to obtain this degree often find themselves unhappy when thrown into this school of study.” 
Not only do colleges and universities need to change the way they approach the major system and how easily students change their majors, the conversation around college majors itself must change as well. 
There are multiple website entries that actually list the “worst college majors” for high-paying careers, enforcing the idea that there are limited paths to success and fulfillment post-grad. Colleges should encourage academic and intellectual exploration by making it easier for students to switch majors, within reason of course. 
College students have a role to play in reforming the conversations by not engaging in language that suggests one major is better or more difficult, and therefore more valid, than another. When talking to ourselves, too, we have to be uplifting and reassuring, since negative self-talk has the potential to affect the way we view ourselves and how we take advantage of opportunities.  Celebrate everyone’s chosen path, even if it makes no sense to you, and encourage those in your life to pursue something they care about or find interesting.

The American public school system seems to do only one thing consistently: fail. As a former public school student, I was thrown into the world with a vague understanding of geography, white-washed history under my belt and deficits in more categories than I’d like to admit.
With the mere state of our political and social climate, I panicked internally as I quickly found out that I had half-baked knowledge on the world and zero clue how to respond adequately. Sure, we can blame public schools ad nauseam, but the reality is that schools are just pawns that participate in a larger construct — one that permeates everyday life and inhibits Black, Indigenous and people of color from succeeding.
In just the book industry alone, research done by writers at The New York Times found that 95% of fiction books published between 1950 and 2018 were written by white authors. But maybe this is a bygone problem that is remedying itself? Not quite. The research reflects that still only 11% of books published in 2018 were written by non-white people. Whether that figure can be attributed to the 85% white majority book editors at the largest publishing firms or perhaps something larger … try a demoralizing combination of both. 
“Something larger” that made headlines in 2020 was the “#publishingpaidme” hashtag where authors shared how much they were paid in advance for their books. Author Mandy Len Catron tweeted: “I, a totally unknown white woman with one viral article, got an advance that was more than double what @rgay got for her highest advance. #publishingpaidme $400,000 for How to Fall in Love with Anyone.” Whereas successful Black author, Roxane Gay, was offered a mere $15,000 for her best-selling essay collection, Bad Feminist. 
What’s worse is that this is not a one-off occurrence, #publishingpaidme is littered with book advance offers that are evidence of a blatant bias for white authors. By examining just this sphere alone, we see how little the experience and productions of Black, Indigenous and people of color mean to a white majority. 
Although the intention to support Black, Indigenous and people of color may be there, it is understandable that it may be difficult to know where to start. However, performative actions and empty promises of support are no longer sufficient; being in the position to decide whether or not to educate oneself is a demonstration of privilege. 
Though increased inclusion seems to be a tall order to fulfill, starting with reform within school curricula could be a good place to start. Over the course of my education, I’ve had to read countless books by white authors that are only kept relevant by their alleged status as “classics” — of course there are actually some “classic” books that are worth reading, but the vast majority are dated, easily forgotten and arguably have very little to teach in actuality.
In the handful of times where I’ve been assigned works by authors of color in school, I can confidently say that they cannot be forgotten so easily. Earlier this year I decided to join my roommate in watching “13th,” a documentary directed by Ava DuVernay for one of her classes. 
The documentary fluidly delineates the United States’ history of racial discrimination and the contemporary version of slavery that is mass-incarceration. In a powerful — and often jarring — documentary, the directors implore Americans to take a look at their country’s government. How can one just forget such haunting subject matter? But I have already forgotten the plot of “Othello” by Shakespeare which I read around the same time.
Education is one of the largest sectors that could increase engagement for works by Black, Indigenous and people of color — and frankly, inane debates on whether or not to represent the 40.9% non-white American population have prevented us from taking advantage of such a large and impactful body of work up until now. The truth is that however menial these changes to curricula may seem, they not only open the door to more informed thinking for the coming generations but also make the pursuit of creative careers less hostile for communities of color.

As training camps begin across the country, there is a noticeable feeling of uncertainty casting a cloud over the usually gleeful anticipation of the start of the season. Not only for a team like USC, which is looking to welcome the Lincoln Riley era with a playoff appearance but for almost every team in the nation.  
This summer, the structure of college football has shifted beneath our feet more than perhaps any other offseason in history. In its wake is a complete restructuring of all of the Power Five conferences, driven by the new college football NIL rules. Out of the 10 D1-A conferences, 7 have undergone changes in membership just in the last year. Now, players, coaches and fans are anxiously awaiting how their teams will fare after the next major realignment. 
The first domino fell when Oklahoma and Texas announced plans to leave the Big 12 to join the SEC in July 2021. To make up for these losses, the Big 12 added Brigham Young University, Cincinnati, Houston, and University of Central Florida. The Pac-12, Big Ten and ACC also responded, arranging a scheduling alliance to compete against an increasingly dominant SEC. Then, after some quiet, the previously unfathomable decision that USC and rival UCLA will join the Big Ten rocked the sports world, accelerating conference realignment rumors.
The most significant implication of these realignments might be the irrelevancy, and possible destruction, of the Pac-12. A once mighty conference that has won more national championships than any other conference in history might soon be reduced to a few mediocre teams, or worse. If the Pac-12 fails to solidify a lucrative TV deal with ESPN and FOX in the current negotiation period, the Big 12 or Big Ten might easily snag the few remaining impressive programs. 
As the Power Five becomes the Power Three or even Two, one may wonder whether realignment is changing college sports for the worse. The formation of these “super-conferences” will certainly be entertaining, but it also causes some outrageous logistical challenges. 
President Folt acknowledged some of these issues in her statement regarding the Trojan’s move to the Big Ten. While the challenges may not be as significant for football, as they only play once a week and have more resources, other programs are more susceptible to these issues. Will USC basketball have to travel to play Rutgers, Michigan, and Indiana in the same week; probably not, but it is going to be extremely difficult to avoid dealing with some burdensome scheduling issues. 
In any scenario, it will be difficult for the families of USC athletes to watch them play as they travel across the country, and does not bode well for athletes’ academic prospects. 
Besides the geographical chaos occurring mostly in the Big Ten, realignment has destroyed some of the most storied rivalries that have lasted centuries like Missouri vs. Kansas and Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State. 
Fans care about certain games because of the history and regional rivalries, much of which are being dissolved by realignment. I’m sure many people will tune in to watch USC fly from Los Angeles to play Michigan in the Big House in below-freezing weather, but is that really something that should be happening every year?
Some critics argue that with players, sometimes in dubious ways, making hundreds of thousands of dollars through NIL and playing games stretching across the entire country, college football has just become another professional league with younger players. 
While I support the move to allow players to benefit from their name, image, and likeness, the blanket approval of NIL with almost no rules on behalf of the NCAA created a worsening wild-west environment. If the NCAA moved to regulate NIL years ago, their hand wouldn’t have been forced so far in the pro-NIL direction.
Boosters who are openly offering millions to convince players to join their programs have turned the transfer portal into a money-making vehicle more than anything else. USC is not innocent, bringing in wide receiver Jordan Addison from Pitt on an eye-watering 3.5 million dollar NIL deal. Other programs, like Oregon, have created NIL marketplaces, expanding the profitability of college athletes. 
Beyond some of the deliberate “pay-to-play” activity, the new anything-goes NIL culture tarnishes one of the best parts of college sports, the unmistakable emotion that the athletes on the field love your school as much as you do.
There’s a unique bond between the fans and athletes in college sports because they chose to attend the same school, sometimes for similar reasons. This is radically different from professional athletes, who are expected to prioritize financial decisions and are sometimes traded yearly. 
This bond will continue to weaken as players abuse the transfer portal to rake in profits. The NCAA must regain some semblance of order in the NIL world to regain the consciousness and integrity of the game.
At the end of the day, all of these changes are about money. Maybe it is naive to think college football wasn’t always about money, but something about the recent moves in the sport seem particularly far from its founding purpose. Hopefully, college football does not lose its spark and some level of normalcy can be restored.
It is undeniable that the move to the Big Ten could bring an era of excitement and attention to USC’s football program that rivals some of the best times in the legendary history of Trojan football. I hope that does not come at the cost of student athletes’ mental and physical well-being or the spirit of the game.
In any event, the Trojans will still have a couple of seasons in the Pac-12 before facing some of college football’s most formidable programs in 2024, and the college football world is holding its breath.

In the summer of 2021, Texas and Oklahoma suddenly revealed that they will be leaving the Big 12 to move to the Southeastern Conference. This summer, USC and their cross-town rivals UCLA decided to make a similar move, this time to the Big Ten. 
As members of the original Pacific Coast Conference which later became the Pac-12, USC and UCLA have significant history. To many, it was stunning to see the universities leave a West coast-based conference with which they have a strong relationship for a conference concentrated in the Midwest. 
However, as the college athletics landscape is dynamically changing with both the SEC and Big 12 expanding, it is clear that USC wanted to be part of the action by joining the Big Ten so that its national presence can continue to grow. 
It appears that USC had been thinking about this move for a while in the past year. After the Texas and Oklahoma announcement, the new Pac-12 Commissioner George Kliavkoff was listening to Big 12 schools who were thinking of joining the Pac-12. So, he held a call with three presidents and three athletic directors from the Pac-12, including USC President Carol Folt. In this meeting, they were to deliberate on which Big 12 teams to potentially add to the conference.
Within about 15 minutes of the presentation, Folt ended the discussion on Pac-12 expansion.  
“Carol [Folt] shut it down,” a source said to the Los Angeles Times about Folt’s involvement in this expansion call. “She [Folt] cooled the whole process,” according to another source from the same article. 
Expanding the conference would mean less revenue per school until the new media contract and USC did not want to stay for that long, especially with the conference’s recent struggles in TV viewership and on-field performance. 
For UCLA, the move was easier to understand. At the start of this year, their athletics department was $62.5 million in debt, so they needed an infusion of cash. Right now, the new Big Ten media deal is expected to pay each member school nearly $100 million per year. Depending on whether the Big Ten can also secure major revenue-building schools like USC’s rival Notre Dame, this value could potentially increase.
With many Pac-12 games happening later in the day for Eastern and Central Standard Time viewers, these schools are not receiving as much viewership compared to other Power 5 conferences in the country. For example, the ratings for the 2021 Pac-12 football championship game between Utah and Oregon had a mere 4.2 million viewers. On the other hand, the Big Ten’s championship game that year between Michigan and Iowa had 11.7 million viewers, the third highest in college football for the 2021 season.
Finally, although USC and UCLA are among prestigious schools such as Stanford and Cal in the Pac-12, the Big Ten provides additional academic benefits as well. Aside from Nebraska, all of their members are part of the Association of American Universities (AAU) which includes the strongest research universities in the country. Moreover, the Big Ten Academic Alliance fosters research collaboration among its schools which strengthens USC and UCLA’s prestige.
Therefore, from the financial, viewership and academic standpoints, it makes sense for both schools to make the move even though it may be complicated geographically. 
Overall, reactions to the decision have been mixed.
“The Pac-12 had to have seen this coming, despite George Kliavkoff’s efforts to connect with USC AD Mike Bohn and sell his vision for football,” said Brady McCollough, a college sports reporter at the Los Angeles Times. “In the NIL era –– and eventually, the pay for play era — the Trojans wouldn’t be able to compete without tons more media rights revenue.” 
“Just got off the phone with someone who believes this eventually leads to two megaconferences — the Big Ten and SEC — with 20 or more members apiece,” said Nicole Auerbach, a senior writer at The Athletic.
There were more comedic remarks on Twitter as well. 
“UCLA at Iowa in November during a driving snowstorm at 11 a.m. CT is just what college football was missing,” said the RedditCFB account. “Sources tell us that the thing that really made up USC/UCLA’s minds was the fact that Ohio State actually got a trademark on the word ‘the’.”
During the Pac-12 Football Media Day last month, Commissioner George Kliavkoff expressed dismay at the departure but still recognized the importance of both schools to Pac-12 history.
“As a conference, we are of course very disappointed by the decisions by USC and UCLA to leave the Pac-12 and a century of tradition and rivalries after 2024,” said Kliavkoff. “That said, USC and UCLA have been proud members of the Pac-12 for almost a century. Despite their decision, we cherish our relationship with their student-athletes, coaches, staff, faculty, alumni and fans.” 
Even though there are a couple of years until the move and UCLA, as a state school, is facing potential challenges from Governor Gavin Newsom and the UC Board of Regents, this move is immense for both schools and will shift the college football landscape. 
Kliavkoff recently re-emphasized his disdain for the decision, telling The Athletic that “It’s clear that USC and UCLA made a decision for short-term financial gain at the expense of their student-athletes … I think they will regret it more as time goes on.” 
The Pac-12 has been exploring options of expansion and could partner with the Atlantic Coast Conference or welcome schools such as SMU or San Diego State to replace its former Los Angeles universities.

Last season was a mess, with a 4-8 record, including home losses to Stanford, Utah and Oregon State. USC had not had such a losing record since 1991 when the Trojans went 3-8. 
Then came the offseason. As soon as the hiring of former Oklahoma Head Coach Lincoln Riley was announced, the excitement around campus was palpable. The transfers of high-caliber players such as receivers Mario Williams and Jordan Addison and defensive leaders like Shane Lee of Alabama only continued to feed the national storylines that begged the question: Could USC return to college football relevancy? 
USC fans should expect a lot of high-scoring games from their Trojans, as USC touts an offense chock-full of Pac-12 Preseason All-Americans — as well as a defense that could be tested. Let’s dive into each position group, beginning with the man who followed his former head coach to Southern California. 
Quarterbacks
In his first and only year at Oklahoma, Caleb Williams earned Freshman All-American honors and bumped former Heisman Trophy contender Spencer Rattler to the bench in the process. Williams came onto the scene with a bang, entering the middle of the Oklahoma-Texas Red River Rivalry down 17-35 before leading the Sooners to a thrilling 55-48 victory with two passing touchdowns, a rushing touchdown and zero interceptions. The preseason Heisman contender finished his season with almost 2,000 passing yards, 21 passing touchdowns and just 4 interceptions. The dual-threat quarterback used his feet for another 6 touchdowns and 442 yards on the ground. USC has a potential first overall NFL Draft pick in Caleb Williams. Backing Williams up will be sophomore Miller Moss, a pocket-passer with a keen ability to evade pressure and throw the deep ball with accuracy.  
Receivers
Just as with the quarterback position, the wide receiver room gained invaluable skill and experience through the transfer portal. Former Sooner Mario Williams joined Riley before Caleb Williams made his decision. Williams averaged 10.9 yards per catch and scored 4 touchdowns for the Sooners last year. His already-established connection with Caleb Williams will certainly help Riley’s offense find its footing. 
Jordan Addison, winner of the 2021 Biletnikoff Award for college football’s most outstanding receiver, will also be sporting cardinal and gold this season after transferring from Pittsburgh. Addison had a whopping 1593 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns last season. 
Third on the receiving depth chart is Colorado transfer Brenden Rice, whose speed and size are reminiscent of his father Jerry, who played some decent football in the state of California in his hayday. Rounding out the board are returning receivers Tahj Washington, who had 54 receptions for 602 yards for the Trojans last season, and Kyle Ford, who averaged 13.3 yards per catch last year. 
Running Backs
Continuing the theme of star players transferring to USC is redshirt senior running back Travis Dye. During his last season at Oregon, Dye rushed for more than 1200 yards and 16 touchdowns. Dye played a key role in the Ducks’ passing game, adding 402 yards and 2 touchdowns on 46 receptions. Dye is shifty and has an innate ability to make tacklers miss in the open field. He can turn on the jets right out of the gate, using his speed to blaze past the defensive line and into the secondary. 
Riley has expressed his desire to develop USC’s run game. Last season at Oklahoma, only six teams averaged more yards per carry than the Sooners. The Trojans also added former Stanford senior running back Austin Jones to their backfield. Jones was a solid contributor to a subpar Stanford team with over 500 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns. Also in the backfield is returning redshirt USC junior Darwin Barlow, a strong and powerful back good for short-yardage situations. 
Tight Ends
Redshirt senior Malcolm Epps is the likely starting tight end, and has received praise from tight ends coach Zach Hanson for his work ethic and impressive plays on the field. Epps was not necessarily a receiving threat last year, with only 10 catches for 173 yards, but with a talented group of wide receivers attracting more attention from opposing defenses, the former Texas transfer could have more opportunities this season.
Joining Epps in the tight ends room is redshirt junior Jude Wolfe and redshirt freshman Lake McRee. Neither bring much receiving experience to the table, but their size will be effective in Hanson’s vision for the tight end position at USC. Hanson, a former offensive line coach, has said his players will be focused on blocking in USC’s new offensive scheme.
Offensive Line
Some blocking assistance from the tight end position might be welcomed by USC’s offensive line, which is perhaps the biggest question mark on the offensive side of the ball. While returning starters redshirt seniors Andrew Vorhees, Justin Dedich and Brett Neilon bring that ever-so-valuable experience to the first unit, there are questions about those further down the depth chart. Vorhees had an excellent season last year, the only lineman in the NCAA who sported a 90+ pass-blocking and run-blocking Pro Football Focus grade. Neilon didn’t allow a single sack in 534 snaps last season. 
However, playing in the trenches is no easy task, and USC’s veteran offensive linemen will need relief from the second-string. New offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Josh Henson will be vital in developing solid options for protecting Caleb Williams and USC’s run game. A national champion and former lineman himself, Henson is celebrated as one of the best offensive lineman coaches in college football. 
Defensive Line
Last year, USC’s pass rush struggled, allowing 8.77 yards per pass attempt and sacking the opposing quarterback just 1.75 times per game, on average. The return of starting defensive end redshirt senior Nick Figueroa, who had 16 total tackles last year, will help bolster the defensive line. Figueroa’s explosiveness and ball location put pressure on both passing and rushing plays. 
Another star of the defensive line is junior Tuli Tuipulotu. The junior had a monster season last year, with 34 tackles, 17 quarterback hurries and 6 sacks. NFL Draft experts project Tuipulotu to have top 50 pick potential and under new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, the defensive lineman native could have another dominant year. 
Linebackers
Returning senior Ralen Goforth leads the linebacker room, with 60 total tackles and a forced fumble last season. Alabama transfer Shane Lee adds valuable championship experience to a team that hasn’t been to the Pac-12 Championship since 2020. Lee had a breakout year in 2019, with 86 total tackles and 4.5 sacks, but in the following two seasons made significantly less of an impact on Alabama’s competitive roster. Riley has spoken highly of Lee’s leadership, comparing him to former Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts, who transferred to Riley’s Oklahoma team in 2019. 
Cornerbacks 
The cornerback position, unsurprisingly, benefited greatly from the transfer portal. Former Colorado corner Mekhi Blackmon had 41 total tackles, broke up 4 passes and added an interception last year. The redshirt senior from Palo Alto will be in a position to lead the pass coverage, which has struggled as of late for the Trojans. Redshirt sophomore Joshua Jackson Jr. is the projected starter opposite Blackmon. Jackson Jr. switched positions from wide receiver to cornerback in the spring of 2021, and 9 nine tackles and 1 interception in 7 games for the Trojans last season. 
Safeties
Xavion Alford, a redshirt sophomore returning to USC, secured his starter status last season with 31 total tackles and 3 interceptions. The former Texas Longhorn will look to build on what was an impressive first season with the Trojans. As a freshman, Calen Bullock started the season opener and had 8 tackles against San Jose State. Bullock finished the season with 6 starts, 39 tackles and 2 interceptions. Bullock was a Freshman All-American in 2021 and will see a lot of playing time this season. 
Special Teams
USC will revamp their special teams, with the loss of punter Ben Griffiths, placekicker Parker Lewis and long snapper Damon Johnson. There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the punter position, as both walk-on candidates redshirt junior Will Rose and redshirt sophomore Michael McAllister have not seen game action. Redshirt senior Alex Stadthaus will likely be the starting kicker for the Trojans. The redshirt senior is 6-for-6 in his in-game field goal attempts, adding a perfect record on his PATs. Redshirt senior Jac Casasante, junior Daniel Meunier and redshirt sophomore Nathan Weneta will compete for the starting long snapper role.

In the internet age, and especially in a city as alive as Los Angeles, the air is constantly buzzing with music. Where prior generations may have heard only live performances or radio singles doled out in meager portions, we now live only seconds away from more new tracks than we could ever hope to hear. In this unceasing ocean of sound, rather than feeling overwhelmed or lost, Jackie Greenberg finds potential for life’s most sincere connections.
“Everyone says math is the universal language. No, it’s music — I don’t know how to do math,” Greenberg said with a laugh. “Music can bring so many people together, in ways that are just indescribable.”
Greenberg, a senior majoring in creative writing and music director for USC’s KXSC, has done just that — harnessing the connective power of music through her online radio show, “Jackie’s Trackies.” In just two years of running the weekly radio hour, Greenberg has expanded her reach thirtyfold while cultivating a tight-knit community of listeners.
A longtime fan of indie music, Greenberg has devoted her extracurricular attention exclusively to music curation since she was in high school — at L.A.’s Harvard Westlake, Greenberg worked at the school’s KHWS station, where the skills and moniker behind the show were built.
While spending her freshman year at the University of Portland, Greenberg had her work as assistant music director at the school’s KDUP station interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
“I’ve always been really into radio. I did it in high school for two years, so I got my grounding there,” she said. “[But] once COVID hit, I knew I wanted to start my own thing because I didn’t really know when I would get back to Portland.”
With newfound time and old passion, Greenberg went all in on launching her new project, adjusting to technical difficulties with a multi-medium creativity, apparent upon landing on the website and exploring Greenberg’s original art and poetry.
“I initially bought my domain name in January of 2020 as my birthday gift, and it took me up until March to get the design and the layout going. It was definitely just trial and error in making it,” she said.
It also took time for Greenberg to settle on the format of the show. Though “Jackie’s Trackies” is now an hour-long weekly broadcast, it began in the spring of 2020 as multiple streams per week of a longer-form program.
“In 2020 when it was peak COVID, I had all the time in the world, and I was also [using the server’s] free trial, which means you can stream 24 hours a day,” Greenberg said. “So it would definitely go between two to four hours, but once I started getting a routine and a typical crowd, I just kept it at an hour.”
Greenberg said that while her radio work has always been “more of a hobby than anything,” it is one she thinks fulfills an important role in her life and in society. While the widespread availability of streaming services has limited the degree to which listeners rely on radio to break new music, Greenberg has used the project to explore how curation can still be remarkably enriching, if not for discovering music, then for connecting with the audience — something she’s also experienced with her role at KXSC.
“‘Jackie’s Trackies’ is sort of my own free reign; I can choose whatever I want, find as much music as I want or as little music as I want and know that the music that I choose, I’m giving directly to the audience that tunes in every week,” she said. “But [at] KXSC, I sift through thousands of emails of new music submissions and have to pick, not necessarily the best of the best, but something that’s good enough for college radio.”
Greenberg has found a home at KXSC, not just because it provides an additional platform for music curation, but also because it prioritizes personal connections, both with its listeners and among its staff.
“This is literally the only club I’m a part of at USC, and it’s the one thing I was most excited for when I transferred initially,” she said. “It just fit in so perfectly, and I love the people I meet at the station.”
KXSC general manager Spencer Churchill harmonized with Greenberg’s thoughts on curation in the digital age. As a music director and assistant music director duo last year, Churchill and Greenberg spent countless hours digging through thousands of direct submissions and online spaces each week to find brand new music for KXSC listeners.
“In my opinion, nobody’s finding out about anything through radio anymore,” Churchill, who now serves as KXSC’s general manager, said. “But sometimes people don’t want to pick what gets played, and people want to hear other people’s taste, so I think it’s less about breaking new artists and more about showing people your taste. It’s more about the personality behind it.”
In the case of “Jackie’s Trackies,” Greenberg’s ability to inject her broadcasts with personality is part of why her online community has grown so quickly. And according to Churchill, on top of being “just fantastic with listening to music,” this quality makes her independent endeavor all the more special.
“It’s a really unique way to build a community online,” Churchill said. “I’ve never seen anybody else make a presence online like that, alone.
The unique qualities of the broadcast are evident to new listeners, but most apparent among the long-time audience of “Jackie’s Trackies,” who, over time, have grown sincere friendships through their similar tastes. On the “Jackie’s Trackies” Discord channel, which Greenberg launched this February, listeners-turned-friends talk and play games late into the night, comparing Last.fms and competing to guess song titles.
“As someone that didn’t really have any friends besides two of my closest friends, having the power to use music in a way that brings people together, it’s so cool,” Greenberg said. “[Music is] such a good way to make friends — it’s one of the most universal things in the world.”
Members of Greenberg’s community reflect similar sentiments. Aiden Brady, a senior majoring in journalism, remarked that even as a first-time listener in the spring of 2021, he felt personally welcomed.
“I think that Jackie did a really good job of creating a tight-knit community where everybody feels welcomed and included in the chat,” Brady said. “From the first time that I ever joined, she welcomes you by name. She asks how everybody’s doing. She’s talking about her own personal life. It kind of feels like, immediately right off the bat, it feels like she’s a friend.”
To Greenberg and the listeners of her program, those feelings are just as important as the music recommendations. She doesn’t just curate her favorite tracks each week — she cares for a community.
“It means the world to me. Every time I go live and I see 16-20 people in there, I’m like ‘Oh shit, people actually want to hear my voice, people want to hear my music,’” Greenberg said. “To know that I have the ability to curate a community and make it a loving and friendly environment where people like to come back to and people feel like they have a safe space almost, it’s one of the most tender feelings in the world.”
“Jackie’s Trackies” streams every Wednesday at 5 p.m. PST on jackiestrackies.com.

When a Big Ten coach told women’s volleyball Head Coach Brad Keller that USC and UCLA were leaving the Pac-12, he didn’t believe it.
“I had no clue, and I didn’t believe him too,” said Keller in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “He told me I was like, ‘Yeah, whatever. You got to be kidding me.’”
The move came out of nowhere and, ironically, while Keller was in Big Ten country recruiting. He’s in full support of the move, one he called “really exciting” that has already made a “significant change” in recruiting. 
But for now, Keller’s main focus is turning around a program that hasn’t won 20 games in a season since 2018. This year’s team might be the one to break that streak. 
“I’m excited about this team because of how into it they are and how bought in they are to each other and just the enthusiasm,” he said. “And there’s a lot on the table here that’s really, really positive.”
Keller expects this year’s team to be “very athletic” with the task of learning how to “pass and touch the ball well.” 
Senior Skylar Fields and sophomore Mia Tuaniga are expected to be “dynamic players.” Senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske is coming off another strong season. Players have been putting in extra work together since the spring semester too, building strong chemistry they lacked last season, according to Weske. 
But the Trojans will look a lot different this year compared to last. 
Eleven out of 17 players are new to USC, including the nation’s top recruiting class and two graduate transfers. Four of the six statistical leaders from last season — Brooke Botkin, Brooklyn Schirmer, Candice Denny and Sabrina Smith — are all gone. 
With all the new faces and lost contributors, it begs the question: Where’s all this excitement coming from? 
“On and off the court, just the enthusiasm and the love for this and the buy-in and just the genuine smiles of ‘you want to be here 24/7’ type of thing is what you want to have … as a coach for your athletes,” Keller said. “They want to be around each other.” 
The improved chemistry of this year’s team is the biggest difference for Weske so far.
Weske said playing during the pandemic with restrictions and not being able to socialize with teammates off the court “definitely had an effect on our game.” 
There’s already been a major shift in the camaraderie of the team behind the new additions. 
“Overall, we’re a younger team now, a much younger team, and I think you can feel that everyone’s full of energy,” she said. 
There’s still work to be done on the court though. USC started practice just last Monday with its season debut set for Aug. 26 against Colgate. 
An emphasis for Keller this season will be ensuring the Trojans come out to a strong start, something he said last season was a learning lesson. 
USC began the first month last year with a 5-6 record, seemingly playing catch up the rest of the schedule. As the Trojans notched wins late into the season, it became too little, too late. 
Paying attention to the smaller details may be the difference maker in a better start, Keller said.
“I always tell my team about the low hanging fruit or the things that are easy that you need to take care of and really be able to touch the ball well and take care of the easy points or the easy transitions or the easy situations where you are on top of it,” he said. “So I think a lot of attention to those simpler things because those are easy points and you have to capitalize on those easy points.” 
In a job that has become “180 [degrees] different” because of the transfer portal and NIL, the goal is still the same for the third-year head coach.
It’s championship or bust. 
“The goal is going to be always competing for national championships. We clearly need to get back into the playoffs, and we clearly need to, once we get back in playoffs, make deep runs,” Keller said. “We just got to get there.”
USC’s quest for its sixth national championship begins on Aug. 26.

Welcome back to another school year at USC! For all my new Trojans who may be worried about what to wear or how to look among the effortless cool girls of Los Angeles, fear no more — I’m here to let you know exactly what will be trendy this Fall/Winter season. 
First, we have to discuss our beloved trend cycle. It’s been a little chaotic, but it seems to have finally settled on what may be the next “it” vibe: sultry. Smokey eyes, red lips, suggestive cutouts  and sheer fabrics will be key for this model-off-duty look. If it isn’t for you, that’s fine too — it seems to be competing for first place with bobo fashion, which elevates the patterns, beading and soft flowing energy of traditional bohemian styles, and twee, a style all about dainty and quaint -— essentially Jessica Day from “New Girl.”
Ballerina core will continue to be in. Ballet flats with bow accents, such as the Miu Miu black and pink flats or classic Repettos, will be stylish and versatile for your next networking night. Want a small heel? Look for the classic Mary Janes. Bodysuits will continue to prove their superiority and take on more leotard elements, such as small ruched details on the neckline, and low and high buns with hair pins will also maintain their popularity, along with boleros or knit shrugs.
Mirror Palais has demonstrated that it can keep the world in its chokehold, and I, too, am a devoted follower. But, like many other average consumers, I can’t afford nor justify spending $800 on a dress. So, Mirror Palais’ aura of delicate lace, maxi skirts, midi dresses and delicate, elegant, almost flirty corsets have been actively gaining popularity. When thrifting, look for white linen pieces with floral cutouts, shaped bodices and tiered prairie skirts. But, if you would like to purchase directly from retailers, other brands that share the same quality are Fait Par Foutch and Enduring Kairos. Pair these with kitten heels with flowers, delicate cutouts or hardware — specifically vintage Prada or Manolo Blahniks (there are some great deals on eBay) — and a small baguette bag to turn heads. 
Since the fall can get chilly, especially at night, it’s time to whip out the jackets. This year, look for motorcycle jackets with straight, choker collars (bonus points if you score a double zipper). Stick to neutral colors like khakis, cremes and greens — or if you’re feeling bold: white. You might find that more jackets may have shoulder pads or a cinched waist, as the structure and physical shape of garments will be imperative this fall. But, if you aren’t into leather (or, lets be honest, pleather), utility jackets, quarter zip windbreakers and light bombers will also come back into style. Just one pro tip, it’s all about the slouch! Notice how recently denim has shifted from high waisted and fitted to mid/low waist and a boyfriend cut? Aim for looser fitting jackets with slightly longer sleeves for the perfect, effortless coverup as the nights get cooler. 
On the topic of effortlessness, brands such as Djerf Avenue will continue to lead the way of the cool business casual girlies. Stick to elevated basics like loafers, medium wash denims, single color midi dresses and the classic tank top. Some great brands besides Djerf Avenue are Joah Brown, Aritzia, Helmut Lang, The Line by K and SKIMS. Want more of an edge? Consider Diesel, Khaite, Pleats Please by Issey Miyake and Sandy Liang. Not a fan of the classic tank top? That’s fine too! This year, Y2K has gone through puberty and emerged with its teenage and college year forms. For a more youthful Y2K approach, continue to look for ironic texts and screen prints from brands such as Melimayystudios, Juliette Johnstone, OGBFF, stomachofyourdeadsoulmate and cydn3yyy. On Y2K’s wild nights at the 901, a cute twist to the miniskirt trend is Danielle Guizio’s sequined mini skirt. 
Have a date with a cute classmate or someone from USC Missed Connections? This year, the sneaky and sexy sheer is back to remind us she can’t be beaten. We first are transitioning out from slip and slinky midi dresses, as the vintage midi slip dresses with asymmetrical, torn and ruffled hem are taking up the spotlight. These dresses are a whimsical amalgamation of bubbles, laughter and DIY jewelry kits, donning fun patterns like bobo prints or splotches of color with the elegant cowl neck neckline — look up vintage Plein Sud, vintage Betsey Johnson, or Fanci Club to see more. While some completely sheer dresses will be popular again and intentionally worn with undergarments like barrettes and high-waisted underwear/boy shorts, it’s also about semi-sheer, where outlines of your legs or your silhouette only come through in the sunlight during the most seductive times of day. 
The half moon nail is rumored to come back, taking inspiration directly from Old Hollywood amidst the release of films about these golden age stars, like Ana de Armas’ soon to be released biopic on Marilyn Monroe. And, with the rise of sultry, there will continue to be an emphasis on the doe-eyed-Lily-Rose Depp-coquette makeup look, often using neutral or base color palettes like those from Dior’s Backstage collection. But, I have a small hunch blue eyeshadow is coming back soon. 
Some other great accessories having their moments are chunky heart necklaces, lockets and straw/weaved bags. My obsessions as of right now are the horny heart from Muddpearl and With Jéan’s latest jewelry drop. A more affordable option to check out is 67 jewelry. Want a smaller everyday necklace? Vintage lockets a la Lana Del Rey are rising in popularity, specifically through American author Ottessa Moshfegh’s Depop page, as she often ships them with a sweet message inside the lockets such as “everything will be okay” or “you are a genius!” Still not sold on the weaved bag? Some great inspiration comes from Prada’s free bag (with purchase) they have given at select stores and Emilio Pucci’s new basket bag with a detachable scarf tote inside it. You might disagree with me on this, but according to fashioniabledata.com, the work of Harvard graduate Madé Lapuerta, the basket bag has seen a 120% rise in popularity recently. 
What are your thoughts on these trends? Happy, or about to call the fashion police? Regardless, the best part is that trends come and go, and you won’t be reported to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for not following them. Go forth and trailblaze with confidence, little fashionistas!

In a year crippled by uncertainty for the Los Angeles Sparks, two things were consistent night in and night out: Nneka Ogwumike has shown up and shown out this season, as have the fans wearing her #30 jersey. 
Consistency is one of the most valued character traits in sports, and most fans don’t even realize how much it matters to them. 
It’s thrilling when a great player signs with a new team, dramatic when they demand a trade, mystifying when they are in a slump and tragic when their skills start to fade. 
With all the excitement that uncertainty brings to sports, it’s easy to forget that everyone’s favorite players are the ones who avoid the drama. 
Uncertainty sells newspapers, but consistency sells jerseys. 
Ogwumike is a prime example of this. As perennially great as they come, she’s filled her trophy case with a WNBA Finals title, WNBA MVP award, 6  All-Star game selections, 4 WNBA All-Defensive first team selections and an All-WNBA first team selection. It wasn’t a surprise when she was selected to the W25 team, a team composed of the 25 greatest players in WNBA history, in 2021. 
She’s a baller, no doubt, but she’s an even more impressive leader. 
You have to be a pretty remarkable human being and be doing some pretty remarkable things to be elected WNBA Players Association President for two consecutive terms, as well as win the Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award for three consecutive years.  
Ogwumike has indeed been remarkable. She’s led the most united and organized pro sports league in the world on the front of social justice, helped salvage a WNBA season in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and led negotiations for a groundbreaking new collective bargaining agreement — and that’s just within the last few years. 
The star player also showed her acting prowess, making her debut in “Space Jam: A New Legacy ” alongside LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Klay Thompson — Arachnneka was the dopest Goon Squad member too. 
All things considered, it’s no wonder it seems like every jersey at Sparks games reads “Ogwumike 30” on the back. 
In a season with so much turmoil, the Sparks especially needed Ogwumike’s consistent greatness. Head Coach and General Manager Derek Fisher was fired due to the team’s underperformance, star center Liz Cambage effectively quit on the team midseason and the team saw a plethora of injuries. Although the Sparks were statistically in the playoff hunt for a majority of the season, they once again fell short.
But Ogwumike has continued to ball at her highest level yet. She in the top 7 in points per game, steals per game and efficiency — her three trademark skills. In other words, as the Sparks miss the playoffs, it wasn’t because she didn’t lead, but because others didn’t follow. 
Most superstars would leave their team after a season like the Sparks have experienced, and who could blame them? Players want to win and the Sparks aren’t winning. There’s no obvious plan for the future and Ogwumike’s contract is expiring. She’s in the prime of her career, and she could get paid well and spend a decent number of years in the prime of her career on a team built to win now. 
But I think she’ll stay. History suggests it. She stayed when Chelsea Gray and Candace Parker left — she’s never given up like Cambage did. There could be a rebuild, or at least a retool, in store next year for the Sparks. But, if I know anything about Ogwumike, she’ll stick around, embrace the challenge and lead the charge like she always has, steady on course. 
Even in the event that she doesn’t return, she’s done enough to establish herself as a franchise player. Her name will always be tied to the Sparks and her jersey should be in the rafters as soon as she’s done playing. 
Here’s to hoping we don’t have her jersey retired for a while, though. Here’s to hoping she can wear her iconic #30 Sparks jersey on the court for a good while longer, because she’s been an icon in action night in and night out. 
As sports fans, our favorite players are the ones who are always there for our team. Nneka Ogwumike has always shown up in full force. 
As long as she continues to shine in the L.A. spotlight, fans need to show up for her in return. They’ll miss an icon if they don’t.
