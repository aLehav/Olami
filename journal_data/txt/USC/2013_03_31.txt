Students listen to Dan Deacon deejay at the fifth annual KXSC Fest, hosted by independent student radio station KXSC. The event was held indoors for the first time in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom on Saturday night. Performers also included Chelsea Wolfe and Nguzunguzu. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Students danced into the night to the sounds of KXSC Fest in the Tutor Campus Center ballroom on Sunday.  Pop/Rock electronic artist Dan Deacon performed in the center of the audience where he pumped up the crowd urging students to let loose in multiple dance offs and synchronized circles.
Deacon’s performance focused on audience participation as students waved their cellphones in the air flashing multicolor light from the self-titled app that he created. Andrea Alonso, a junior majoring in Print and Digital Journalism, felt that Deacon closed the event on a great note that helped to increase the energy and allow students to engage more with one another.
“It was incredible and I’ve been needing to move my body like that so it was an explosion of excitement.”
so happy and bizarre and perfect. 
Thank you so much to KXSC for working their butts off and putting on an amazing Fest that greatly adds to art/music/collaborative culture at USC.
I would like to see support from the university to move the event back outdoors in order to return to the traditional springtime festival atmosphere of the last four years, an atmosphere that necessitates open space. BUT, mad props to KXSC for working within the system this year and bringing an artist that definitely worked in the indoor venue. It was such an awesome experience.
And thanks to DT for covering it!
i love KXSC this years fest was good even tho it had to be underground and students only :(
Thx for coverin, DT.
Wack caption doe… Deacon did many things on sat night, but he aint no “deejay”
Great video! Thanks for capturing such awesome moments, DT!

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, March 28, and Friday, March 29. 
Crimes against a person
At 7:17 P.M. on March 28, DPS officers on routine patrol were flagged down by a witness who reported that two non-USC females were involved in an altercation at 2828 Figueroa St. One of the subjects had been punched in the mouth during the incident, but she did not desire criminal prosecution of the matter and an Los Angeles Fire Department rescue ambulance unit subsequently transported her to LA Metropolitan Hospital for medical treatment. The second female and her companion were questioned and released at the scene.
Crimes against property
at 1:24 p.m. on March 28, non-USC male reported that he observed a suspect remove a tip jar from a restaurant counter inside the University Village International Food Court and that he confronted the subject. The suspect relinquished the tip jar and the male returned it to the restaurant. The suspect fled on foot and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:48 A.m. on March 29, four students were arrested, cited and released by DMV investigators for possession of fake IDs at the 901 Bar & Grill.
at 10:09 P.M. on March 28, DPS officers responded to a student who sustained a cut when he smashed his finger with a dumbbell while placing it on the floor at the Lyon Center.  An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #826 responded.  The RA unit treated the student; he was then released to the officers, who transported him to California Hospital.
at 1:02 P.m. on March 28, DPS officers contacted a student who was reported to be behaving erratically at Leavey Library and transported him to the Engemann Student Health Center for evaluation. The student was then transported to a mental health facility for further evaluation.

Motion-sense video games have found a higher calling than simple entertainment. A researcher at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, Belinda Lange, has been exploring the potential this type of gaming has to improve the way physical rehabilitation is performed and monitored.
“This game-based technology can really help us to, firstly, encourage people to do their exercises,” Lange said. “Secondly, we can collect some data that will help us to see how people are doing their exercises and how they’re improving over time, and we don’t have that capability right now.”
Since 2010, Lange and her team have been developing a motion-sense application called Jewel Mine, which is aimed at addressing the unique challenges physical therapists face in their daily work. Lange’s team uses focus groups and frequently tests prototypes in local clinics to ensure the needs of both physicians and patients are being met.
“We’re really focusing on how can this be used in the clinical setting and how can we get this application to be something that physicians understand, patients understand, and we know that they’ll use it together because we’ve been working with them along the way,” Lange said.
The project began after Nintendo released its Wii gaming system. Researchers took notice of the immense popularity of the games on the platform and the ability games such as the Wii Fit had to motivate people to get moving.
“[We were] watching people use the [Wii Fit] balance platform and really seeing them want to shift their weight, which is always exciting, for a physical therapist at least,” Lange said.
Lange said the need for gaming technologies specific to physical rehabilitation quickly became apparent.
The first alteration to the motion-sense gaming system was the ability to customize exercises on a patient-by-patient basis. To do this Lange said there needed to be a stronger emphasis on specific areas of the body and restricting certain movements dependant upon the abilities of the individual.
“For example, someone who had a stroke might not be able to move one side of their body, yet the games can’t be changed in order to have them fit their level of ability,” Lange said.
The second area of concern was the commentary games like the Wii Fit provided to its users.
“The feedback is really negative [in video games],” Lange said. “In the rehab setting we really have to be careful about what we say to people because that can really change the way they feel about continuing doing exercises.”
These problems were some of the first addressed by Lange’s team, who has been knit-picking the project to perfection ever since and as the project has grown, so has the distribution of the application.
“Since 2010 we’ve been going through [the aforementioned process] with a number of existent clinics around the Los Angeles area and now we’ve reached about four clinics around the U.S. as well,” Lange said.
Lange said many physicians and their patients are beginning to view this application as a helpful and innovative method to add to their rehabilitation programs.
“It’s helping them to realize their potential because they’re focusing on a game and not focusing on what they can’t do,” Lange said.

The Viterbi Startup Garage, a technology accelerator aimed at growing startup companies run by USC students and alumni, is looking for its first crop of companies to assist and advise.
Game time · Google VP of Social Products Bradley Horowitz speaks to students at a event hosted by the Viterbi Student Innovation Institute, which also encourages students to create their own start-ups. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Startup Garage, announced by Viterbi on March 26, is accepting applications through April 22; the 12-week summer program will begin May 28.
Students in the program will receive expert mentoring, access to investors, working space and $20,000 in funding. Ashish Soni, the program’s director and a founding director of the Viterbi Student Innovation Institute, said two primary goals of the program were to help USC achieve its vision of developing the next big technology company and enable students to start successful companies.
“One of the things we realized was that students need time, access to resources [in the form] of financial support systems, mentoring and coaching. It’s hard to get all of that in a semester,” Soni said.
In addition to focusing their attention on the university, the program also seeks to encourage technology startups to stay in the Los Angeles area.
“With the Viterbi Startup Garage, we aim to provide the support needed so that this talent can fully develop its potential and make Los Angeles and Southern Californiaone of the most vibrant technology startup regions in the world,” said Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis C. Yortsos in a statement.
Viterbi is partnering with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, a leading venture capital firm, and United Talent Agency, a talent and literary agency, to run the program. As a part of the program, participants have access to the KPCB and UTA networks when they are building their companies.
“Students will have access not just to capital, but to insight into building companies, insight into the market, into how you build successful companies,” Soni said. “[The combination of] a top engineering school, a top venture capital firm and a top business development talent agency is a unique combination that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the country.”
Though other technology accelerators exist in Los Angeles, the Viterbi Startup Garage is unique in its focus on students and its link to a major university.
“We’ll leverage our partners, our faculty and our alumni to help make these companies successful,” Soni said.
This year the Viterbi Startup Garage will look at digital andsoftware-based companies, as well as hardward companies. Soni said the directors of the program are looking to increase the size of the program in the coming years.
“The goal is to increase the number [of accepted companies], but this is the first year, so we want to start small, have some early success and grow from there,” Soni said.
Founders of AIO Robotics Kai Chang and Jens Windau, both Ph.D. students in computer science who applied to the program, hope that their company is one of the few companies accepted into the program.
Chang and Windau said the Viterbi Startup Garage’s association with USC and dedication to supporting students makes it very appealing to them.
“We can trust the entire Viterbi community. The Trojan Family seems more comfortable to approach than someone who is not ‘related’ to you, necessarily,” Chang said.
Jason Wei, the co-founder of Taggle and a junior majoring in business administration who applied to the program, said he hopes his company, which helps people find the best price for printing custom T-shirts, is accepted into the program because of the technology accelerator’s extensive networks.
Wei and his partners said the Viterbi Startup Garage’s resources could help their business grow rapidly, and that they would use the $20,000 funding to reach college campuses beyond USC and UCLA.
“[We are] trying to scale aggressively this summer. In order to do that, we’re going to need office space, we’re going to need financial resources and moving onto the next stage is also much easier with great mentors, which this program offers,” Wei said.
Any current USC students or alumni who graduated from USC within the past five years may apply, as long as at least one co-founder or CEO is a Viterbi student or alumnus.
Really love the driving force behind this project. Los Angeles has so much potential for its tech enterprises, but we need to keep these bright entrepreneurs and developers in Southern Caifornia in order for Silicon Beach to really get going. Great article.

The final stage in the international search for a new director for Annenberg’s School of Journalism began March 26 after the last “Director Search Job Talk.”
Final stretch · Geneva Overholser, the director of Annenberg’s School of Journalism, will step down in June. Her successor will start work in July. — Courtesy of USC News
The new director is slated to begin work on July 1.
“The expectation is that the school will have a new director in the next few weeks,” said Bill Celis, the associate director of the School of Journalism. “USC Annenberg Dean Ernest Wilson III, advised by faculty feedback, will make the final decision.”
The selection process began when current School of Journalism Director Geneva Overholser announced last year that she would leave at the end of June 2013, the conclusion of her five-year term.
“Geneva Overholser is a visionary leader who has spent her career focused on how to make journalism excellent in every way — more inclusive, more democratic, more focused on civic engagement,” Wilson said. “When she agreed to put her experience and energy toward the education of the next generation of journalists for a five-year term here at USC Annenberg, we knew we were embarking on a revolutionary time for the school. Geneva has set the bar very high for her successor.”
Vice Dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Larry Gross said it is imperative for the new director to continue Overholser’s legacy.
“The chief qualities we are looking for in a new director include someone who can maintain the extraordinary momentum established by Geneva Overholser and her colleagues in the past few years as the School of Journalism has responded to the upheavals in the field of journalism by transforming itself into a journalism school for the 21st century,” Gross said.
The finalists to succeed Overholser as director of the journalism school include Executive Editor and Senior Vice President for The Seattle Times David Boardman, Associate Professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University Douglas Foster, Vice President and Managing Editor of The Associated Press Kristin Gazlay and Dean of Academic Affairs at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism William Grueskin.
The quartet of finalists represent the top applicants from a pool of dozens that was gathered beginning last spring. Each was selected by a committee and invited to meet faculty, students and the administration and deliver a talk on the nature of journalism in the modern world.
“We wanted a wide swath of feedback for deciding the leader of one of the country’s most prominent journalism schools,” Celis said.
Based on the feedback gathered during each candidate’s visit, a variety of criteria will be applied in the process of determining the new director.
“We are looking for someone who embraces change and are effective in leading faculty and staff colleagues through change,” Celis said. “We want a director who is forward-looking and who acknowledges not only the problems but also the promise of journalism and how we reframe the practice of journalism in a new century.”
Celis said that the changing role of journalism to reflect digital platforms, more diverse voices and greater public dialogue will frame the qualities sought for in the new director. With the emergence of citizen journalism and journalism’s evolution as a form of two-way conversation with the public, Celis said the new director will need to be open to both new ideas and new voices.
“We are looking for someone who is open to experimentation, acknowledges the importance of diversity both in terms of recruiting students and faculty and teaching a new generation of journalists to include a broader range of voices,” Celis said. “We want somebody who values the fairness, accuracy, context but also understands that much of how we practiced journalism in the past is changing and must change.”
Gross emphasized that the importance of journalism to greatersociety places a high responsibility on the journalism school’s next leader, who will be charged with leading the journalism school.
“Journalism schools are the teaching hospitals that train the next generations of professionals to provide the information in the public interest that is the lifeblood of democracy,” Gross said.

When it comes to the subject of supernatural phenomena, producers have moved in quite a few different directions.
There are the romantic, sexualized vampires that seem more interested in finding potential mates than sucking blood, which supposedly is their natural instinct.
And there are glamorized witches and wizards from series such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Wizards of Waverly Place.
Whatever forms they take, paranormal creatures recently have been portrayed as desirable, alluring or comedic — the film Zombieland made zombies into a joke and Warm Bodies portrayed a zombie as loving and expressing human characteristics (which is much different than the archetypal Dawn of the Dead-type of zombie situation).
However, the much-acclaimed The Walking Dead, which ended its third season on Sunday, is bringing the true, original blood-and-gore of zombies back to reality.
Fortunately for AMC, the show is not all blood, guts and gore. In a seemingly impossible situation, it seems AMC has brought deep meaning into the goriest of the supernatural.
Fans seem to rave about how each episode leaves them longing for more. How can a show called The Walking Dead — a title that conjures images of zombies ripping flesh off of screaming victims — keep viewers on the edge of their sofas?  The drama and personal stories amid the zombie apocalypse though, are what make the show worth watching.
In fact, even someone who would never in a million years expect to enjoy a zombie-filled apocalyptic world (and would much prefer harmless romantic comedies) can be swept away by the story line and outrageous arc in The Walking Dead.
What is truly remarkable about this show is that, essentially, it is an outrageous hyperbole of everyday life situations. It brings up common issues such as what we, as humans, do when we are desperate in traumatic situations. Do we look out for ourselves or do we keep our compassion for our loved ones?
It brings up inherently complex issues of loyalty, loss, self-worth and regard for human life while still remaining true to the idea of waking up to a terrifying world taken over by zombies.
Essentially, is The Walking Dead meant to be a metaphor for real life?
Characters, such as the leaders Rick and Shane, are thrown into complex situations in which they must take control of their questionable motivations to try and come up with the “best” solution for the struggling group. The choices are never clear, and the answers are never obvious.
Failure is not an option. For the show’s characters, death occurs often, in tragic ways. Despite the instances of heartbreak that characters face, they move on and continue trekking through the zombie-filled forests.
In the last episode before the season finale, the returning crazy yet beloved character, Merle, finally “mans up” and attempts to help the group — unfortunately, he does not quite change his irrational ways in time to survive.
Guilt also exists. After all, why should a friend die when another friend lives?
Characters point fingers, sleep with their friends’ wives and kill their best friends in Lord of the Flies-esque situations.
This is one of the most profound paranormal television shows currently on air.
The characters deal with tragic loss, heartbreak, and issues of moving on, which are matters all individuals deal with at one point or another, whether the situation is as simple as an elder family member passing on or dealing with a catastrophic event such as 9/11.
In the article from Psychology Today, “The Moral Molasses of the Walking Dead,” Dr. Steven Schlozman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, discusses the psychology behind The Walking Dead.
According to Schlozman, The Walking Dead “keeps the outlandish authentic and real.” In the article, he states that the show uses moral questions as a means of how humans react to terror.
“You can’t watch the show without putting yourself in the characters’ shoes, and that, for my money, is key to good drama,” Schlozman writes.
Moreover, The Walking Dead goes beyond other zombie-centric works where the main point is to watch zombies brutally taken down by heroic champions. Instead, it presents morally complicated choices that make the viewer stop and think about what he or she would do in the situation (no matter how outrageous it is).
Perhaps there is something authentic about the outrageous. Using the hyperbolic situation of a zombie invasion can show humanity’s deep tendencies more than a realistic, nonsupernatural show.
The Walking Dead shows humanity at its lowest — in desperation, searching for a way out of the most traumatic of situations. That alone sheds a new light on television (and specifically, the “dreamy” vampires that do not even drink human blood).
The one issue with The Walking Dead, however, is that sometimes it seems to go on and on, with no way out and no clear imminent ending. After all, it’s not like Superman can fly in and save the day by ridding the world of the “biters.”
Inevitably, it seems there is no way out of “zombieland.” But perhaps there, lies the true metaphor to reality.
As zombies cannot be simply eradicated from the earth, people cannot simply escape from their problems. Instead, they must fight to live good, honorable lives – — and take out as many zombies as they can along the way.

Great article, I found it to be spot on, and very well thought out comparisons and analogies. The changes we witness wholesome characters go through is something one can miss if they aren’t paying attention to subtle cues, such as shane slowly turning bad, or Carl’s slow turn into exactly what his mother feared. The basic human instinct of helping people in need, turns into a shoot out between two parties simply because their is no real way to determine whether they mean to do you harm. It’s crazy to think the solidity of civilization, the basic connection of goodness between living things, the good that always defeats the evil….is more or less just an instant slip back into the dark ages in a world changing event like what’s depicted on the show, or even less in a very serious natural disaster, the people turn primal, survival comes before moral decency, there seems to be a lot of room for error and when I look at the possibility that good people may engage each other in violence simply by crossing paths and not knowing the intentions of the other is sad and it makes all the advancements in culture, lifestyle, and civilization over the past few hundred years, look far less concrete and more of a facade we put on, to get away from the fact that instead of hunting food with spears and bows, we have shopping carts. This cycle of war peace war peace historically repeats itself, but anyhow, I found this piece of writing to be spot on and above and beyond the average pieces I’ve been reading. Very keen of you to approach that angle of this series, which has dumbfounded me in how popular it’s become, I expected the cult fanatics but not mainstream average folks to be as engulfed in it as they are shows like homeland and dexter. Anyhow it’s all very interesting food for thought and philosophical consideration, theirs no room for saints or sinners…dale, Hershel, all have a great outlook but unfortunately that do unto others stuff goes right out the window when failure to engage a group like ricks passing by could result in them engaging you, neighbors, common people who were once closer to the side of saints, having to do whatever it takes, to save the ones they love from even the chance that the passerbys aren’t peaceful….it’s a very grim outlook of humanity, in the words of Merle, “you as cold as they come officer friendly” systematically you go from best friends to deterioration of everything you once were when food and water and shelter and security were readily available. It is optimistically worth noting that when their is growth, acts of kindness and peace are worth more than they were to begin with. When you can grow to trust people  you are either smart or dumb, but one thing is for sure…the made for tv version is easy for people to distinguish its make believe, what is not make believe though are the human interactions, tendencies, evil getting a place to thrive, good having a difficult time staying on the path or righteousness, and the basic yet super justifying need to survive, their are a lot of things a human would do without hesitation to survive, that he or she would never even see themselves doing. All of the skills that would make you a good asset to the group to be invited to stay as part of the family, are exactly the same dangerous skills that would make you a threat. Or simply in a more desperate time, having your own food and arms is easy Pickens for sinners next meal without any remorse felt. The show does an amazing job of diversifying the prototypical characters….exhibiting pregnancy, and lack of communication, children, lone wolves, weirdos, veteran, rednecks, hunters, michonne the only black female samurai possibly ever, nerds like Milton, heroes, villains, saints, devils, prey, predators, peacemakers, peacetakers, possibly the most real emotions I’ve ever fealt from a show which have even been terrorizing nightmares….fear, safety, anger, rage, forgiveness, loss, courage, growth, peace, mistakes, love, sacrifice, family, cannibalism, leadership, allegiance, betrayal, and most of all the expectation of anything….all the photographs come from a time before, no one is taking any post apocalyptic group photos or Polaroids …. I’m so excited to see where this direction is heading, I expected more closure from tonight’s episode as twd has become notorious for finale closures. Thanks for writing this piece! Keep up the good work and best luck to you on your career path, with pieces like this you are destined for greatness, this is what people want to read aa out and are juggling in the back of their minds between episodes and cliffhangers.
Mollie Berg, a freshman majoring in “Stating the Bleeding Obvious”….

In a city that’s always buzzing with activity, whether it’s an upcoming movie release or restaurant opening, there’s always something to look forward to — or rather, count down to.
Tic-tock · After observing that Facebook desperately needed some sort of social countdown feature, Nick La Maina was inspired to create Tikr. — Courtesy of Nick La Maina
Tikr, a social countdown app that connects users with their interests and friends, is a tool that Nick La Maina, a senior majoring in business administration, thought up after coming across a high school friend’s newsfeed on Facebook.
“She would always post [on Facebook] that her birthday is coming up, and she would say something like ‘50 days, 49 days…’ every day,” La Maina recalled. “I wondered why she didn’t just create a countdown, so I started searching countdowns and there was nothing out there that was both user-friendly and also fun. Then I thought how great it would be if people could follow countdowns.”
With this idea in mind, La Maina began to reach out to friends and past co-workers, searching for any valuable players to jump onto his project.
“I reached out to everyone and anyone I could think of. I brought the idea to life with mock-ups and graphics and started networking,” La Maina said. “I got lucky through a mutual friend with Amplify, an accelerator here in Los Angeles, and connected me with a mobile developer who liked the idea.”
La Maina even got a hold of Dallas Mavericks owner and venture capitalist, Mark Cuban.
“I worked on Shark Tank last summer as production assistant and there was this moment — I heard in the lobby that Mark Cuban needed some cookies. I knew which cookies they were because it’s a company he’s invested in so I said I’d do it,” said La Maina. “[Once I met him] I told him there’s a project I’ve been working on for a while, and he gave me his email. Six months later, I reached out to him and he replied back saying he liked it.”
The app, which includes five widgets including an “add countdown” option, is easy to use. Users can create countdowns in which they can add photos to or tag friends. Once the countdown is set up, users can share it via Facebook, Twitter, email or even text.
But if there’s nothing too exciting coming up in a user’s agenda, he or she can discover other countdowns by connecting with interests, companies or friends on the app. So if a new gadget — say, the rumored iPhone 5S — is coming out, a user can follow the Product Releases feed or follow a friend’s iPhone 5S countdown.
La Maina also has Tikr mapped out for brands and celebrities, where social countdowns can be created and users can follow the brand or celebrity within the app and share new content through social media.
So far, the featured feeds on Tikr include the USC Academic Calendar and Silicon Beach LA (a calender of events for start ups in the area), but La Maina is hoping to accrue more content and notable names.
“The next step in development is content partnerships,” La Maina said. “We’re hoping to do some test Tikrs with Sony in the next month.”
Between networking and perfecting the app, La Maina continues to take advantage of all the school’s resources before he graduates in the spring.
“I’m in an entrepreneurship class, and it goes hand in hand,” La Maina said. “Part of those assignments are networking, and I’ve built a good relationship with my professor who’s become a mentor throughout the process.”
In the transition from full-time student to full-time entrepreneur, La Maina has taken away important lessons on how to foster success.
“Start [as] early as you can, as fast as you can. … There are 30,000 people here, so take advantage of it while you can because it’s really helpful,” he said. “Get a mentor too, someone who’s been doing it, so they can help you. There are a lot of cool opportunities on campus.”
And even though he’s graduating soon, La Maina still hopes to tap into the Trojan network for as long as possible. He’s even looking to hire a USC student soon.
“Currently, I’m looking for a new engineer or Viterbi student,” La Maina said. “It would be a great opportunity for a student to get on board a project that is already live.”
If you haven’t downloaded the app yet, perhaps it’s about “time” you did.
Correction:  A previous version stated that Dallas Mavericks owner and venture capitalist Mark Cuban serves as an advisor for Tikr.  The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Growing up, alumna and award-winning singer and songwriter Kina Grannis wasn’t always comfortable in her skin.
But, through her own music and lyrics, the Japanese-Caucasian singer started to gather a following of fans who appreciated her style and, in turn, felt more able and happy to embrace who she is.

As  a part of Mixing It Up, a Visions and Voices showcase event on Tuesday, she will celebrate her mixed heritage with a performance at Bovard Auditorium.
“Some people thought I was Hispanic or part black; I was this confusing-looking person, and it made me very adaptable,” Grannis said. “I wouldn’t say that it directly affects the music I make, because music is about the human experience regardless of race or anything like that, but I do think in my career that I’ve had a ton of support from the Asian community because of this,  which is really amazing.”
Grannis’ support hasn’t just come from the Asian community. She began her career with the support of friends and mentors at USC, who convinced her to release three EPs during her time in school. College gave her time to retreat to the stairwells to perfect her songwriting skills and also gave her experience performing.
“It really allowed me to work on my songwriting even though I was doing a bunch of other academic stuff too,” Grannis said. “Also, I started playing shows — I played at Ground Zero all the time — so it was a perfect practice stage for me.”
Her success grew exponentially through all of her online support. Most artists have dreams of making it big — of having audiences scream for encores, of selling millions of album copies, of doing what they love and getting rewarded for it.
She was close to fulfilling that dream. Her music video was featured during the 2007 Super Bowl to 97 million viewers, and then following that she landed a major record deal with Interscope Records in 2008.
But then she turned it down.
Her confidence in her own sound, as well as her independence as an artist, made her rethink and finally forfeit the deal in favor of publishing her album herself.
“They wanted me to scrap the album and make a new one with songwriters they would choose,” Grannis said. “For me, music had always been very important and personal, so the idea of having to make a new album that I don’t really care about when I have one that meant a lot to me sounded bad.”
Despite taking an alternative path, she has gained huge popularity, especially in the singer-songwriter world. Her sound is very much acoustic and mellow, perfect for a coffee shop.
“A lot of my songs can have a more introspective and, on the surface, sad feeling, but I think the thing I hope comes out through my music is a feeling of hope,” she said.
After a whirlwind of time since she graduated in 2007, Grannis will begin producing her second album, set to debut in the fall.
She also hopes to tour again soon, debuting her new music, spreading the Trojan love and continuing to fight the odds as a half-Asian performer in the music industry.
Meanwhile, she will return to USC in the hopes of inspiring the same tenacity and dedication in current students.
“I really will take any excuse to come back to ’SC, and it’s been a couple years now, and it seems like a fun opportunity,” Grannis said. “It’s also a hapa show, so all the performances are half-Asian. … All of my life that’s been a big part of my identity, so it gives me an excuse to give back to my alma mater and get to meet some cool people.”

Despite some questionable officiating, faulty timekeepers and a few missed opportunities, the No. 1 USC women’s water polo team played past distractions on Saturday to pick up both wins of a doubleheader against Cal State Bakersfield (10-18, 0-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) and Brown (12-13, 2-2 Ivy).
The Women of Troy (18-0, 4-0 MPSF) continued their undefeated season with flair, easily dispatching the CSUB Roadrunners 19-6 in the early game and finishing the job with a 16-5 victory over the Brown Bears immediately after.
Along with adding two wins toward their overall record, USC gets to add an important MPSF win to their conference record — a win that will come in handy when trying to land the No. 1 seed in the MPSF conference tournament.
Against the Roadrunners, the Women of Troy offense came alive in blistering fashion, scoring six unanswered goals to begin the game. CSUB scored its first goal of the game midway through the second quarter, but USC responded effectively with four more goals of its own before the half was over.
After a strong first half, the Women of Troy were less sharp to begin the third quarter, coughing up multiple turnovers and suffering ejections that led to three Roadrunner power- play goals. USC was outscored 3-2 in the quarter, but the team bounced back in the fourth to put the game away for good.
Sophomore Eike Daube, who proved to be the most prolific USC scorer on the day, opened the scoring in the final quarter, slipping by a Roadrunner defender and rocketing the ball past the goalie. Sophomore Monica Vavic and junior Kaleigh Gilchrist each added goals before the Roadrunners got on the board for the first time. All told, the Women of Troy would outscore CSUB 7-2 in the quarter and ultimately win the game 19-6.
Daube was especially impressive, scoring a career-best five goals in the first game and tacking on three more against Brown.
“Eike was excellent shooting-wise,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “She was eight out of nine [shooting], and it was really encouraging to see her have the best games of the year for herself.”
Against Brown, Daube led the team in scoring again, followed by juniors O’Donnell, Hannah Buckling and Olivia Cummins, each with two goals apiece. The Women of Troy featured two different goalies in the game, with junior Flora Bolonyai making four impressive saves in three periods and freshman Alegra Hueso saving a goal in the fourth quarter.
The Women of Troy swarmed on defense, allowing only 11 goals on the day, most of which came when the team was down a defender because of an ejection. The defenders swatted away most shot attempts, and Bolonyai and Hueso blocked the few that reached the cage.
“We know that our defense is the main component of our game,” senior co-captain Dominique Sardo said. “From here up until the NCAAs, we live by the motto that ‘defense wins championships.’”
But offensively, USC was even more dominant. The Women of Troy had an unrelenting attack throughout both games and were particularly efficient in power-play situations.
“The best part of our game was our 6-on-5,” Jovan Vavic said. “We shot 13 for 17 in those situations, which is very, very good.”
Usually accompanying those power-play goals was a flurry of passes, another sign of an unselfish USC offense. Junior co-captain Gilchrist was an excellent facilitator on offense, racking up 8 assists to go with her 4 goals over both games.
“Our team did a great job making extra passes, which led to easier scoring opportunities,” Monica Vavic said. “Kaleigh Gilchrist had eight assists between the two games, so having people like her able to find the open player really makes our team a much more dangerous offensive team.”
The Women of Troy will play next at Loyola Marymount on Thursday, April 4.
Wow, beating Bakersfield and Brown draws some distinction. This sport has only one criteria which is to win
your last match in the finals. Undefeated at this stage means very little.

High-profile athletes take a lot of barbs during their careers — both warranted and unwarranted. But perhaps no insult gets tossed about more recklessly by armchair fans than the “soft” label. And, unfortunately for the players, when the label gains momentum, it often sticks.
We’ve all seen it: the receiver who alligator-arms a pass in fear of an oncoming collision with a head-hunting safety, the running back who scampers out of bounds instead of burying his head for an all-important first down and the player who languishes on the bench for half of the game because of a tweaked hamstring.
Of course, I would never call any players in Division I college football soft. Heck, most of the players I’ve interviewed here have biceps bigger than my torso. It’s impossible for a player to progress to this stage without a tolerance for debilitating pain and without the courage to run full speed into brick walls.
That said, few people at the moment would categorize USC as the nastiest, grittiest football team, even in the city of Los Angeles. Far too many times last season, USC came up short on what I term “pure” football plays: not plays with any frills or misdirection, just those involving strong athletes trying to outmuscle one another when everyone in the stadium knows what’s coming.
In addition to Notre Dame’s energy-sapping, fourth-quarter goal-line stand in the Coliseum, there were plenty of other examples of USC’s failure in these situations. Oregon running back Kenjon Barner — thankfully ticketed for the NFL this offseason — ran for 321 yards at USC in 2012. Of those 321 yards, a whopping 272 came before contact.
What does that mean? USC’s defensive front seven got absolutely manhandled at the point of attack by Oregon’s blocking scheme. A svelte Oregon starting offensive line that averaged a mere 299.2 pounds steamrolled four-lane highways through which Barner waltzed.
To remedy this lack of toughness and to return to power football heading into next season, USC head coach Lane Kiffin has restructured his practices this spring, integrating more full-contact sessions. To win games consistently in 2013, USC will need to manage the clock with a proficient run game and improve tackling technique, both of which can only be enhanced and cultivated through physical practice. Of course, Kiffin has recognized this for a while but still will not commit to a similar approach in the fall because of limited numbers imposed by sanctions.
Thus far, the roster attrition as a result of player injury has been startling. Seventeen players, the vast majority of whom are on scholarship, sat out of Saturday’s scrimmage with an array of injuries; at this time, there are only 62 scholarship players in the entire program.
The list of injuries to this point includes junior wide receiver and Biletnikoff winner Marqise Lee, presumptive senior starting running back Silas Redd and half of the two-headed tight end monster in junior Xavier Grimble. That’s a tremendous amount of all-star talent on the training table.
But despite the growing injured reserve list, Kiffin must continue to forge ahead this spring in his efforts to exact more tenacity out of his players.
For the time being, defenders need repetitions tackling at full speed so that when the 2013 season begins, they are not constantly getting dragged five yards before hauling the opposing ball carrier down to the ground. Similarly, the offensive line — perhaps the most underachieving position group on the team — needs to cultivate a willingness to play for the entire snap and to knock down anything in its way.
Kiffin can always scale back once fall camp rolls around. For example, he might force Lee to wear a yellow “no-contact” jersey during the fall — much like he did with former wide receiver Robert Woods — to limit his defenders from laying punishing hits on Lee, considering the junior sensation already sustains far too many blows on Saturdays. Unfortunately, USC will not have the luxury of conducting full-contact practices in the fall, simply because the roster contains several holes and too many players who are absolutely indispensable.
It’s unrealistic to expect players to simply flip the switch come game day and summon the necessary technique and mentality needed to win these individual battles, which is why this spring practice experiment is so important. Of course, only time will tell if this black-and-blue spring will pay dividends in the fall by helping to produce the hard-nosed Trojan football that fans have cheered for in past generations.

Coming into an Easter weekend set against the Cal Golden Bears, USC’s baseball team had won a dismal three of its last 15 games. It hadn’t won a conference road series since April 2011, and seemed in danger of losing 15 games in the month of March alone.
Making strides · Though he was hitless in Saturday’s loss, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs singled and scored a run in Friday night’s win. – Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
 
Instead, the Trojans walked out of Berkeley with an impressive series win, playing the kind of baseball USC head coach Dan Hubbs has been waiting for all year.
The Trojans (11-16, 4-5) took the Thursday and Friday matchups in a pair of complete team efforts, and went into the Saturday finale against the Golden Bears (16-12, 5-4) looking for their first conference road series sweep since 2003.
The Trojans led 4-0 in the fifth inning, but disappointingly fell back into old habits that plagued the squad throughout the frustrating month of March and was unable to hold the lead.
Freshman shortstop Blake Lacey smacked a two-run homer — the first of his career — to give the Trojans a 4-0 lead in the top of the fifth. But in the bottom half of the inning, freshman pitcher Kyle Twomey — stellar to up that point — walked and hit the first two batters, then gave up a three-run homer to cut the Trojans’ lead to 4-3.
After USC was held scoreless in the top half of the sixth, Twomey allowed a pair of solo shots in the bottom half as Cal took a 5-4 lead. When the offense failed to respond again in the top of the seventh, Twomey and the Trojan bullpen imploded in the bottom half. Twomey gave up two singles to the first three hitters he faced and was removed in favor fellow freshman Marc Huberman, one of the more reliable pitchers for Hubbs this season in a wildly inconsistent bullpen.
But Huberman was also shaky, surrendering four consecutive singles without recording an out before being lifted. With the bases loaded, senior Matt Munson was called in to relieve Huberman. Munson promptly allowed a grand slam before settling down and getting the Trojans out of the inning, but not after they surrendered eight runs en route to a 15-5 defeat.
Saturday’s blowout, however, was not at all representative of the first two games of the series. USC took advantage of four Golden Bear errors on Friday to battle back from a 3-0 deficit and cruise to a 9-5 win. Every Trojan starter had a hit, and six recorded at least one RBI. Sophomore starting pitcher Wyatt Strahan tossed six solid innings of three-run ball to earn his long-overdue first win of the season.
In Thursday’s game, junior starting pitcher Bob Wheatley and his Cal counterpart, Ryan Mason, engaged in an impressive pitchers’ duel, each going seven strong innings. But Mason, who allowed just three runs (two earned), was outdone by Wheatley, who gave up only one unearned run.
USC allowed Cal to tie the game at 3-3 in the eighth, but the Trojans were able to string together three straight singles to plate the winning run in the ninth, giving the team the momentum it needed to earn a much-needed series win.

The USC swim and dive athletes always have the goal of restoring pride to the storied tradition program, and the Trojans accomplished just that this past weekend.
Finishing strong · The USC men’s swim and dive team toppled a bevy of school records over the weekend in Indianapolis. Its fourth-place finish was the best since head coach Dave Salo came to the school in 2006. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Junior Vladimir Morozov took home two individual titles and led the Trojans to their first 400-yard freestyle relay title and an overall fourth-place finish at the 2013 NCAA men’s swim and dive championships in Indianapolis.
After claiming the 50-yard freestyle crown on day one of the competition, Morozov snapped the NCAA record in the 100-yard freestyle in 40.76 seconds on the final day, becoming the first Trojan to win the race since 1974.
“That 100 free is by far the race that I’m most proud of,” Morozov said. “I took it out there about half a second faster than usual at the 50 and did my best to hold on to break the record.”
Morozov also teamed with juniors Dimitri Colupaev and Jack Wagner and sophomore Cristian Quintero to clinch the 400-yard freestyle relay in a school-record 2:48.33.
“It felt great to be the last ones to stand on the highest step of the podium as the meet came to an end,” Morozov said.
It was the first time USC won the race since 1977 and USC’s first relay title since 2002. With the win, USC passed Florida, Texas and Stanford in the standings, jumping from seventh to fourth.
“What a great evening to be a Trojan,” USC head coach Dave Salo said in a statement. “Watching the score through the night, our only ‘hope’ was to take care of business in the 400 free relay. We did our job with the win and another school record and the rest of the pieces fell into place.”
In a competition in which USC had only 11 racers, the Trojans broke school records 15 times — including in all five relays — and ended with 289 points overall to take their highest finish since placing fourth in 2001.
“I’m really proud of these guys and my staff with all the hard work and determination over the past seven years to get here,” Salo said.
After a disqualification last year, USC’s 800-yard freestyle relay team, composed of senior Alex Lendrum, sophomore Chad Bobrosky, Colupaev and Quintero, placed third in a USC-record 6:15.94 time.
“Dimitri and Cristian picked up where Morozov has been leading the team. Colupaev’s lead off and Quintero’s anchor legs in the 800 free were critical to our performance tonight,” Salo said. “Coming off outstanding individual performances in the 200, their unselfish performance in the relay was inspiring.”
Morozov highlighted the first day of the competition with USC’s first title in the 50-yard freestyle since 1977. His 18.63 mark was the fourth-fastest time ever and was USC’s first men’s NCAA title since 2007.
The Trojans placed second in the 200-yard freestyle relay with the efforts of freshman Maclin Davis, Colupaev, Morozov and Wagner in a school-record 1:16.22 time.
On the same day, Davis, Lujan Rivera, Morozov and Spinazzola set another USC record after placing fourth in the 400-yard medley relay with a time of 3:04.98. Spinazzola’s lead-off 100-yard split in 46.36 also broke a school record.
Coming into the momentous weekend, Salo said his goal was for the program to become a perennial top-five finisher at the NCAA championship meet. After last season’s seventh-place finish, the seventh-year head coach appears to have the team well on track.
“I’m just so proud of these guys,” Salo said. “My players and my staff, with all the hard work and determination over the past seven years to get here, it’s just great to see this success.”

Students for Israel
On the right to national security
Two weeks ago, during his visit to Israel, President Barack Obama told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that “[his] first task is to keep the people of Israel safe.” Israel is the most important ally of the U.S. in the Middle East and it is the only one that is a democracy.
Every nation has the right and responsibility to protect its people, and the security fence that keeps Israelis safe is a justified method of protection.
This fence was erected in response to the Second Intifada, a period of massacres and suicide bombings during which an overwhelming majority of those Israelis injured and killed were civilians. Following the construction of a significant portion of the fence, the number of attacks decreased dramatically.
Another fence built to save lives stands between Gaza and Israel. These nonviolent structures are harshly criticized. To be sure, the fences interfere with the daily routines of the Palestinians living in those areas and must have some negative effects on the general population. Yet they exist out of necessity, not ill will.
This preventative heightening of security is a normal reaction to the constant threats and multiple acts of terror committed by a hostile neighbor. This same response was seen in America following the 9/11 terror attacks. To this day, there is increased security along U.S. borders and in all airports.
Of course it is inconvenient to arrive early at an airport to be wanded, to step into full-body scanners and to even be forced to remove clothing. However, most Americans, including myself, would most likely not board an airplane nowadays without these preventative measures.
Certain tactics have been used by several activist groups to undermine Israel’s efforts to keep people safe. First, they set up “checkpoints” on campuses and subject students to intimidation techniques. This is an effort to delegitimize the state of Israel. Furthermore, they demand that certain everyday products produced in Israel be boycotted, a call that USC has rejected. This, once again, is an attempt to delegitimize the state of Israel.
Noam Chomsky, an American activist for the Palestinian cause, calls the movement hypocritical and says it has a double standard. He continues to say that the Palestinian people don’t want the boycott. Ardent supporters of these sanctions also have stated on record that the purpose of the boycott is the destruction of Israel.
This anti-Israel sentiment is also seen in the Palestinian government. Hamas, the controlling party in the Gaza Strip, is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada, the European Union and others. Hamas’ charter calls for the complete destruction of Israel and still does not recognize Israel as a country.
The Palestinian Authority is no better. Before Obama’s trip to Israel, the PA honored a woman who urged her three children to commit acts of terror. Earlier this month, Hamas seized control of the entrances of Gaza and refused to allow 65 humanitarian aid trucks into the Gaza Strip, causing harm to the Palestinian people.
In addition, both Hamas and the PA have refused the UN’s request that they take in Palestinian refugees who had fled from the conflict in Syria. Israel has actually brought Syrian refugees across its borders to receive humanitarian aid and medical treatment in Israeli hospitals.
Lt. General Sir Alexander Galloway, a former director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said that “It is perfectly clear that the Arab nations do not want to solve the Arab refugee problem. They want to keep it as an open sore, as an affront against the United Nations, and as a weapon against Israel. Arab leaders don’t give a damn whether the refugees live or die.” It is very sad when leaders cause the general population to suffer in order to further their own agenda.
Israel, like every other country, is not perfect. Yet it is held to standards not required of other nations and is constantly criticized — in fact, some of Israel’s harshest critics are members of the Israeli government.
However, history shows that Israel has been willing to make tremendous sacrifices for peace, such as giving up half of the capital city of Jerusalem. Ultimately, it takes two to make peace.
I suggest that we focus on ending the suffering seen on both sides of the fence. Currently, the fence is a necessary barrier for defense, but it is mostly chain link and therefore temporary. All that is needed is a government on the other side who cares about its people enough to want the fences removed, too.
 
Harris Nickowitz
Junior, Neuroscience
While I do appreciate your attempt at TRYING to show Israel as a peaceful nation who only wants what’s best for both the Palestinians and the Israelis….most educated individuals are aware that Israel is not a nation that advocates fair rights for all people. How could anyone support building of a wall? Israel has taken Palestine’s land, and is further isolating them with these walls.
Is the following also Israel’s fault?  Why is it that wherever we find Islam we find restrictive freedoms?  Is this ALL Israel’s fault or does Islam share the blame for this consistent pattern found throughout Islamic countries?
…………
Feb 13, 2013
In another story the Western media apparently refuses to cover, any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas or the Palestinian Authority risks being arrested or summoned for interrogation.
Palestinian journalists are now hoping to bring this to the attention of President Barack Obama when he meets with President Mahmoud Abbas next month.
The journalists say they want United States and the rest of the world to know that the crackdown on freedom of expression in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip is designed to hide the fact that Palestinians are governed by two repressive regimes that have no respect for human rights and democracy.
There has never been a Palestinian state or Palestinian people (other than Israelis), so there is no such thing as “Palestine’s land” to take.  However, Israel has attempted to cooperate in facilitating the creation of a “Palestinian”  state for Arabs who dwell in areas liberated by Israel.  This notwithstanding unprovoked multiple acts of aggression against Israel, by its Arab neighbors, unwilling to recognize Israel’s right to exist notwithstanding UN mandate. FYI, every autonomous nation in the world builds security walls to protect their boarders.  It is the PA that have isolated the people for which they ostensibly govern, by declaring 2 intifadas rather than negotiating in good faith (or otherwise) for a final peace accord, after Israel offered over 96 percent of the land demand by Arafat’s government and after the PA refused to even propose any counter offers with land swaps. It is the the PA that have isolate the people they ostensibly represent by  inexcusably launching rockets (over 10,000 of them ) into civilian populated areas of Israel since Hamas has taken over Gaza.  It is the PA that have isolated the people for which they ostensibly protect, by indoctrinating hatred toward Israel and Jewish people in their PA controlled media and schools, and cutting all opportunities that once existed for cooperative trade zones with Israel, calling for divestiture and prohibiting any Jew or Israeli from establishing residency in any area controlled by the PA.  Fair rights for all people?  Jews and Israelis have no rights whatsoever in the area occupied by the PA. In contrast, Arabs reside in Israel, have the right to vote, practice their religion, pursue relationships regardless of sexual orientation, attend public schools, access the healthcare system, own real property. None of these rights are extended to Jews by the PA – and you speak of fair rights for all people? In Israel, there are duly elected Arabs in the Keneset (legislature) and Supreme Court.  Arab Israelis have won recent televised contests.  Unlike the totalitarian regime operated by the PA, Israel is a democracy with civil rights and liberties that do not exist in the Arab would. If the PA would just accept the right of Israel to exist as the Jewish homeland (the only Jewish state in the world where Jews can be guaranteed freedom from discrimination, which is only fair, given that there are dozens of Muslim and Christian countries in the world,  Israel is only the size of New Jersey (approximately 20,000 km) whereas the Arab countries occupy approximately (13,486,861 km ).  There is no need to “try” to show Israel is a peaceful nation.  The fact remains that Israel desperately seeks peace, and has a history to prove it.  It reached a peace accord with Egypt and Jordan. Israel facilitated creation of a PA.  Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza.  In contrast, the PA and hostile terrorist organizations, which share power within the region, thwart all efforts to achieve peace, so that they may pursue their own selfish power motives, by perpetuating hate and conflict.
A few errors in this article, coming from an Israeli Jew:
* “Israel is the most important ally of the U.S. in the Middle East and it is the only one that is a democracy.”
* In fact, Turkey is a member of NATO, allied with the US, and is a democracy.
* “Israel has actually brought Syrian refugees across its borders to receive humanitarian aid and medical treatment in Israeli hospitals.”
* Hamas also gives aid to palestinians in Gaza; giving aid is no excuse for violent actions in other venues
* “To be sure, the fences interfere with the daily routines of the Palestinians living in those areas and must have some negative effects on the general population. Yet they exist out of necessity, not ill will.”
* No one is criticizing Israel’s right to have a border fence; rather, they are criticizing Israel’s decision build and maintain a wall that encroaches on Palestinian lands (past June 4th 1967 lines) in a blatant land grab
* “[Noam Chomsky] continues to say that the Palestinian people don’t want the boycott.”
* That is a huge claim, and you better back it up with sources, as I (and most everyone else, I believe) finds that incredibly difficult to believe.
I urge the author of this article, along with many others, to realize that just as a patriotic Democratic American can criticize American Foreign Policy, a Zionist Jew can criticize Lieberman and Netanyahu.
Turkey a democracy?  Compared to what?
Turkey has imprisoned more journalists than any other country in the world.
…………
Hamas has provided aid to Palestinians in Gaza just like Israelis?
Yes but that’s not the issue.  Has Hamas ever extended a hand to help an injured Israeli?  Never is the answer.
…………
Building the wall was NOT a “blatant land grab” it was to prevent the endless homicide bombings in Israeli restaurants, buses and at wedding ceremonies and the fence stopped these things from happening.  It’s too bad Palestinians forced the construction of the fence but they did do so by their success at killing Israeli women and children.
……….
Though I too condemn Israel for their blatant disregard for basic human rights and their continued settlement building and their complete animosity for the Palestinian people, I would urge everyone to check out the Op-Ed published in Monday’s edition of the Daily Trojan from a student representing the other side from SJP. It looks like the DT has been covering a great deal of events from both communities, so before you start launching accusations of bias maybe try reading the paper or, even better, writing an op-ed yourself.
As for Arafat – before you go of on your islamophobic and stereotypical rants void of any real argument, it may interest you to actually try reading some of the comments being made before you start launching accusations about muslims and palestinians on this campus that are just blatantly untrue. BEING PRO PALESTINE DOES NOT MAKE YOU ANTI SEMATIC.
The wall is referred to as a “fence,” or “barrier,” because 95% of it is a fence.
The only instance I know of, where the fence separated Palestinians from their land was Bil’in. The Israeli Supreme Court ordered the fence re-routed and that was resolved.
As Palestinian shahids massacred dozens of Israeli men, women and children in the early 2000s—at times almost daily, in discos, pizzerias, hotels, and on buses—the Israeli public cried out for a solution.
The famed Israeli intelligence and military were rendered useless; despite all their efforts, they could not stop the carnage. People would shudder as they got on a bus, not knowing whether they would make it alive to the end of their ride. Daily life became a nightmare.
The right-wing Sharon government, which did not want to put any barrier between “Judea and Samaria” and the rest of Israel, was finally forced to erect the separation fence and the onerous checkpoints.
The bombings stopped cold.
The attempts at murdering Israelis—“amaliyats,” which received the blessings of the vast majority of Palestinians—have never ceased. There are dozens of attempts every single month and the only things that stop them are the barrier, the checkpoints, and the intelligence-driven arrests.
The barrier placed 80% of settlers and 3% of the West Bank land on the Israeli side—land that under all negotiations and agreements was to fall under the Israeli state anyway. But for pro-Palestinian propagandists, this has been enough to call it an “apartheid wall,” a “land grab,” etc.
If you were an Israeli, would you rather be labeled a “racist” and stay alive, or would you rather have a good reputation but have your life turned into a living hell until one day you yourself get blown up into shreds?
This language, about “Israeli Colonialism” only serves to provoke hatred of Israeli Jews, does little to really help the Palestinians, and makes peace even less possible. It may lead to events such as the ones brilliantly depicted in Jonathan Bloomfield’s award-winning thriller, “Palestine.”
AIPAC, AIPAC, AIPAC, AIPAC…… 
Buy them, sell them, threaten them, but above all, get what is best for Israel….nothing else matters, nothing. You are either with us or against us–there is no in-between. Drink the KookAid or die. Drink my minions drink.
Without American money and support we are nothing, nothing. So, get your AIPAC on and get out there for Israel!!!
That Israel is still the subject of hatred is deeply disturbing and one of the forces that drives my support for the Jewish State.
In choosing not to stand idly by as the age-old hatred of the Jewish people has been transferred to the “collective Jew,” I have been speaking up against the new anti-Semitism that is so pervasive today.
It targets the Jewish people by targeting the Jewish homeland, as the source of injustice and conflict in the world.
It is perversely couched in the language of human rights.
Just as conventional anti-Semitism denied Jews the right to live as equal members of humanity, the new anti-Semitism denies the State of Israel the right to live as an equal member of the international community.
The Cult that is Hillel speaks and dribbles and vomits….all over itself.
‘The only religion I respect is Islam. The only prophet I admire is the Prophet Muhammad.’ — Adolf Hitler
As a bystander who continues to learn about this conflict, I think it’s sickening to see how the Israelis/Zionists normalize and even deny the Palestinian oppression. Israel is one of the major human rights violators of the world and that’s a FACT.
Given that you support the Palestinians who openly advocate Jewish genocide (see their duly elected leaders clear-cut party covenants), you correspondingly do as well. It’s hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would openly advocate the liquidation of Jews, but you clearly do and it doesn’t seem to bother you a whit.
Moreover, it would be hard to believe that anyone would support second class status for women, the honor murder of teenage girls, the brutalization of gays and the suppression of dissenters. But you, as supporters of the Palestinians who regularly practice all of the above, are therefore complicit in these sexist, racist and fascist beliefs as well.
Why are you so bigoted, misogynist, anti-gay and such hater of Jews? Please tell us pray tell.
And if to be opposed to such garbage practiced by so many Muslims world-wide makes one an Islamophobe, count me and all who believe in freedom and hate sexism and bigotry vs Jews as a proud Islamophobe.
I fourth that!
More money for Israel, more money for the oppressors, more money to build that wall bigger!
Go Israel–straight to hell
While Muslims in Syria kill women, children, elderly indiscriminately – up to 90,000 people and counting – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites in sheep’s clothing.
While Muslims have killed up to one million in Sudan, and counting, we devote our anger on Israel for we are really just anti-Semites pretending we are humanitarians.
While Muslims in Mali have forced 500,000 (and counting) people into refugee status – as they have done in the past year – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be for social justice.
While Muslims kill off what remains of the ancient Hindu population in-and-around Pakistan we devote our anger on Israel for we are like the Germans during the 1930s – people who needed a convenient scapegoat to escape their own feelings of frustration.
While Muslims have wiped out all the Buddhists from their ancient homeland in Afghanistan we devote our anger on Israel for it’s easy to pick on Jews and we are shameless hypocrites engaging in man’s oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism, while pretending to be holier-than-thou.
The Isaelis for USC are running wild!
Build that wall higher and longer Mr. Netanyahooooo…….
OMG, you are defending the concept of the wall, Mr. Nickowitz?
You missed your calling–you should have been a Nazi–maybe you are a modern day one.
“Arabs, rise as one man and fight for your sacred rights. Kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history, and religion. This saves your honor. God is with you. ”
– Hajj Amin al Husseini on German Nazi radio.
……
Rob – maybe you are the modern-day Nazi.  Your own words implicate you as one.
Ad Homonym attacks are quite ineffective. I guess by your logic, every nation in the world which erects border fences are Nazis.  Query, is the PA a Nazi organization?  They refuse to allow any Jews to live within the area under PA control.  To me that sounds awfully familiar to what the Nazis set out to do, rid themselves of the Jews.  Are you a supporter of that PA objective Rob?
Israel can take their wall and stick it where the sun don’t shine.
Israel is a fascist state run by fear and violence against people who disagree with them.
For every Israeli who dies in the conflict 40 Palestinian die. You tell me who is doing all the killing and taking and lying.
The following was written by an Arab Muslim:
“So, the question now is that who is the real enemy of the Arab world?
The Arab world wasted hundreds of billions of dollars and lost tens of thousands of innocent lives fighting Israel, which they considered is their sworn enemy, an enemy whose existence they never recognized. The Arab world has many enemies and Israel should have been at the bottom of the list. The real enemies of the Arab world are corruption, lack of good education, lack of good health care, lack of freedom, lack of respect for the human lives and finally, the Arab world had many dictators who used the Arab-Israeli conflict to suppress their own people.
These dictators’ atrocities against their own people are far worse than all the full-scale Arab-Israeli wars.
In the past, we have talked about why some Israeli soldiers attack and mistreat Palestinians. Also, we saw Israeli planes and tanks attack various Arab countries. But, do these attacks match the current atrocities being committed by some Arab states against their own people.
In Syria, the atrocities are beyond anybody’s imaginations? And, isn’t the Iraqis are the ones who are destroying their own country? Wasn’t it Tunisia’s dictator who was able to steal 13 billion dollars from the poor Tunisians? And how can a child starve in Yemen if their land is the most fertile land in the world? Why would Iraqi brains leave Iraq in a country that makes 110 billion dollars from oil export? Why do the Lebanese fail to govern one of the tiniest countries in the world? And what made the Arab states start sinking into chaos?”
Just another Israeli brick in the wall and ultimately in their own undoing.
What a load of crap from the drones for Israel.
The Israelis don’t want peace and everyone knows it, at least not until they get everything the Palestinians have: land, water, money, resources, everything
Israel is universally condemned by the world for it human rights abuses.They are virtual outcasts. Obama castigated Israel for its self-imposed isolation from the world and urged it to change the way it treats its Palestinian neighbors, if they want peace. 
Aparteid practiced by Israel is not democracy it is human abuse! Separate roads, towns, buses, schools, etc.
How long is the Daily Trojan going to continue acting as the mouth peace for the Israeli Government Garbage. This is truly sickening.
The Israelis own the Daily Trojan. Despicable Bias!! Unconscionable glad handing to Hillel and its professional lobbying campaign at USC. This is truly outrageous disregard for the rights of the Palestinian People. 
We will not be lobbied into believing that THE WALL is anything but a prison!
I just want to know, have you ever been to Israel to confirm these bold claims you make? Have you seen these human rights violations and “separate roads, towns, buses, schools, etc.”? If you haven’t, I’d encourage you to go visit sometime. You’d be very surprised to see that everything you think about Israel isn’t actually true. 
But if you haven’t gone, you probably won’t go visit and will continue thinking you know everything about a country you haven’t even been to before. Being pro-Israel does not inherently make you anti-Palestinian, you just need to take a step back and realize maybe both sides have valid points and concerns.
Why is it do you think that no Arab country has ever been condemned for its human rights violations by the UN.  Look at what is happening in Syria?  Israel, Apartheid, not even close. talk to anyone who lived in South Africa at the time.  They would be offended by your suggestion.  No other country in the Middle East has anywhere near the civil rights that exist in Israel. Walls define boarders in every country in the world.  I guess Egypt too is guilty then of creating a prison for the people of Gaza.  But you make no mention of that.  Perhaps, the Daily Trojan is biased toward Egypt too?  Apparently, you have issues with the Hillel organization, as well? I understand that you have your opinions, and biases, but do you not think others have the right to express their opinions in the opinion section of this publication.  Sad and pathetic.

It’s not uncommon in 2013 to hear a media outlet of some sort calling on Americans for a “frank and honest discussion about race.”
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
Quite honestly, a large proportion of articles I’ve read that document racial and cultural tensions seem to conclude with an anecdote about how Americans need to talk about race in order to make it less of an divisive issue.
And the general volume of material about race generated online and over the airwaves is tremendous. In that sense, it seems quite plain that this “conversation” is already happening, and happening a lot. It doesn’t hurt that articles corroborating claims of racism in America tend to court controversy and attention, as they strike a nerve about a problem that many would prefer to ignore.
Indeed, despite its publication more than two weeks ago, Robert Huber’s article “Being White in Philly,” published in Philadelphia Magazine, is currently in the online top-five list of The Philly Mag Network and continues to be the center of great discussion about the article’s merits.
Ta-Nehisi Coates makes the case, in a recent piece for The Atlantic, that people who call for a discussion about race often do so with the thought that the “issues that they are tackling have, somehow, never been tackled before, or if so, have not been tackled ‘honestly’ or ‘forthrightly’ or ‘candidly.’”
“In the arena of race, the notion that Americans ‘don’t talk about race’ is a particularly pernicious rendition of this logic,” Coates wrote.
In light of that, Coates is calling for more depth, not just more talk. He notes how a number of the race-issue articles he reads get “lost in a sea of interesting anecdotes that never gel into anything.” Even when they call for a discussion, these articles never amount to more than a simple description of a reality, as opposed to addressing the root causes.
Clearly, this isn’t working as well as it should. The amount of news dedicated to documenting racist acts indicates that racism is prevalent in contemporary society. But, clamoring for more discussion on race for the sake of it is misguided because the most obvious point discussed — differences in race — is not the root issue at hand.
By contrast, having a “discussion” about race often glosses over a greater issue, one that involves not only racial interaction, but also gender relations and sexual identity.
The United States needs to talk about not just race or sexuality or gender but about national ignorance. Discourse on ignorance would do more to solve the common issues of intolerance that the nation faces than trying to attack on issue on the surface.
Although a “dialogue about ignorance” could easily be dismissed as a topic just as broad and faulted as one on race, I think that writing on and conducting forums about just race is limiting largely in part because the root cause of racism — ignorance — is a thoroughly widespread issue that leads to more types of intolerance than simply ones that relate to race.
In many cases, individuals act intolerantly when they know they’re wrong but are unable, or refuse, to accept that. This refusal can result in anger that is taken out on the perceived problem, which, for many racist individuals, comprises the people who are different. In this case, the focus upon the perceived problem — that person’s racism — overlooks that person’s general mindset of willful ignorance.
I don’t think there is any question that the United States has reserved a special niche for producing some of the most ignorant people on planet Earth. Ignorance, for one, contributes to a general social air that “it’s cool to be dumb.” The apathy toward education and intellectualism in many parts of American society do nothing to advance greater tolerance toward people of different races, genders, etc.
Though dialogues on race are needed to keep the topic fresh in our collective mind, I believe that pure and unadulterated ignorance is very often overlooked in light of “solving racism.”
I could be interpreted as simply deferring a conversation on race into one on ignorance. Nevertheless, I don’t think that argument changes the importance of addressing canonical ignorance. Battling ignorance might be less black and white than fighting for one particular hot topic, but it’s also the foundation of why our nation remains so divided.
