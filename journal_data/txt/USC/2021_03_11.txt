After picking up his second foul with over 13 minutes left in the first half of Thursday night’s Pac-12 quarterfinal matchup, USC’s star freshman forward Evan Mobley walked back to the bench in frustration. Facing a Utah team that held Mobley to just two field goals in their previous two meetings combined, it seemed as though the Utes might have gotten Mobley’s number defensively. 
Mobley’s long stretch riding the pine proved to be a blessing in disguise for the Trojans. The well-rested 7-foot big man put up a dominant second half effort in USC’s 91-85 double-overtime victory against Utah.
After registering only two points and no rebounds in the first half, Mobley came out of the locker room actively looking to take over on both ends of the floor. He finished with a career-high 26 points, nine rebounds and five blocks, in addition to shooting a solid 11-14 from the free-throw line, where USC has struggled all season. 
“Evan played an all-around game. He was just spectacular on offense, he was under control,” head coach Andy Enfield said after the win. “I think you saw the whole offensive repertoire; I just thought he played an unbelievable game in the second half and the two overtimes.”
Mobley looked like a player who was very much worthy of the honors he earned this past week — Pac-12 Player of the Year, Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, and the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year —  becoming the first-ever conference player to win all three awards. 
In the second half, Mobley was everywhere. He challenged shots at the rim and forced the Utes to kick the ball back out to the perimeter. Offensively, he was knocking down outside jumpers, getting to the rim for easy jump hooks and drawing fouls down low. It was clear who USC’s go-to guy was, especially down the stretch as Mobley put up 13 of his 26 points in the game’s two overtime periods. 
Contrary to USC’s slow, mechanical offense, the Utes up-tempo offensive system relied on numerous difficult shots to keep themselves in the game. Junior forward Timmy Allen did his best to steady the ship for Utah, putting up 20 points and 13 rebounds in a team-high 48 minutes. 
Senior guard Alfonso Plummer came out of the gates hot for Utah, connecting on two tough, heavily contested jumpers to start the game. He finished with 16 points, including a game-tying three over Mobley’s outstretched arms to push the game to double overtime. 
Freshman guard Ian Martinez, who averaged 4.6 points per game this season, was a thorn in the Trojans’ side all night long, scoring 18 points on an efficient 7-10 shooting night. His mid-range jump shot seemed to be going in all night, and Martinez continued to use the threat of his jumper to get to the rim at will with his quickness. 
“We played really hard tonight. Plummer was 6-15, and Allen was 6-17, so that’s 12-32,” Enfield said. “Timmy Allen is a two-time All-League player — you’re not going to shut him out, and Plummer, with the exception of that last [3-point shot], we held him in check [for] most of the night.” 
Utah’s three-headed monster comprised of Allen, Plummer and Martinez ran out of gas to close out the game. Allen and Martinez, along with two other Utes, fouled out in the second overtime when the Utes needed a scoring boost to keep the game alive. 
Despite losing Mobley to foul trouble early in the game, a plethora of Trojans stepped up to fill in for his occasional absence. Six Trojans finished in double-digit scoring figures, with an all-around team effort on the defensive end to clinch the win, holding the Utes to 30% shooting from beyond the arc.
Senior guard Isaiah White added 14 points along with five rebounds. Junior guard Drew Peterson and senior guard Tahj Eaddy each contributed 13 points.
“It was a long game, a hard game. That’s what March Madness — the postseason — is,” Mobley said. “There [are] going to be a lot of big shots, a lot of overtimes, hard games. So, you’ve just got to push through, stay tough and stay focused.” 
USC moves onto the semifinals of the Pac-12 tournament, where they will face the winner of the California-Colorado matchup at the T-Mobile Arena. Tip-off is Friday at 8:30 p.m.

For distinguished activist and bestselling author Ibram X. Kendi, the pandemic has brought racial disparities and Americans’ denial of racism and promotion of ‘color blindness’ front and center. At a Zoom event Wednesday, Kendi explained that refusing to talk about and identify race will not make racism disappear. Ignoring race during the pandemic would amount to ignoring the fact that Black and Indigenous people and people of color have been dying at disproportionate rates, he said.
“When we identify racially it allows us to collect racial data, and if we have racial data that allows us to see racial disparity …we can start to now figure out what are the policies and practices and conditions and structures that are causing those disparities,” he said. “The worst thing we can do is have a deeply unequal society that nobody can see, let alone challenge.”
In partnership with Culture Journey, the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion week team hosted a dialogue with Kendi, who is also the founder of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. The discussion focused on the practice of anti-racism and how it applies in the context of recent events in the United States and promoting change at USC. 
Black Lives Matter protests and marches following the murder of George Floyd in May last year served as a catalyst to further expand the conversation on racism in the U.S. Books such as Kendi’s “How to be an Antiracist” saw an exponential increase in sales during this time. His work has been a significant contribution to the plethora of work done by Black and Indigenous people and people of color activists and academics for years.
“I think to bring in one of the most renowned scholars in this work helps us navigate this intellectual territory around racism, because he also helps us see racism through many lenses,” said Renée Smith-Maddox, a clinical professor, diversity liaison in the School of Social Work and chair of the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee, “I don’t think we could have made a better choice than to have Kendi come and talk with us at this point in time.”
Smith-Maddox is also the co-founder and co-chair of DEI week, a week dedicated to building a ‘tool kit’ of equity and inclusion through a series of events and programs that draw on the insights, expertise and experiences of various experts both within and beyond USC. 
“It was an opportunity, in our minds, that we could create this learning space for the Trojan community to have this ongoing environment that will cultivate their understanding and learning of diversity, equity and inclusion,” Smith-Maddox said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
In conversation with Kendi was professor Camille Gear Rich from the Gould School of Law, who co-founded and co-chairs DEI week with Smith-Maddox. Rich is also the founder of PRYSM, the USC initiative for the study of race, gender, sexuality and the law. The pair started DEI week five years ago and have been working diligently to make the week a meaningful source of growth for USC. 
“For the past five years we’ve been bringing people together to teach new skills to have difficult conversations and really to celebrate the members of our community who do this hard work, all year long, and to invite more people into the conversation,” Rich said.
Kendi is one of these people. His work has focused on how being anti-racist differs from being ‘not racist’ and how one can implement anti-racist principles and practices in their lives, at both personal and institutional levels. Rich and Kendi’s conversation opened with a discussion on what the difference between anti-racist and ‘not racist’ means. 
“To be anti-racist is to figure out a way for us as individuals to challenge that system of racism,” Kendi said. “But also the way in which we go about challenging that institutional racism is really coming to grips with and being honest and vulnerable with ourselves, and recognizing the racist ideas we’ve internalized that cause us to see the problem as people, as opposed to that racism we should all be fighting.”
Their reflections on the U.S.’ journey with racism led to an impassioned conversation about the storming of the Capitol in January, an event that blatantly showcased the threat of white supremacy. For Kendi, it was proof of two things that the U.S. public can no longer deny. 
“First, that the greatest domestic terrorist threat of our time are white supremacists. Secondly, that police officers have the ability to show restraint,” Kendi said. 
The latter point addressed public discourse around police brutality towards Black and brown people that argues bias training and other such reforms are part of the solution.  
“If they can show restraint to an armed mob who is sacking the U.S. Capitol, then they can show restraint to any American,” Kendi said. 
The storming of the Capitol has also been evidence of what Kendi identifies as the course of racism. While some typically think ignorance and hatred inform racist thinking which then leads to the institution of racist policies, Kendi identifies it as the other way around. Elected officials use voter suppression policies targeted at Black and Indigenous people and people of color, and thus encourage the spread of racist ideas, he said.
“This is what’s critical, thinking about the attack on the Capitol, you had the mass consumption of those ideas. So you had American people who were misled into believing that indeed the election was stolen by those Black and Brown voters,” he said, “And then that caused them to be ignorant and hateful and thereby stormed the U.S. Capitol.”
Rich and Kendi also discussed the compassion, vulnerability and transparency involved in the anti-racism process and in the process of holding other people and institutions accountable for their racist behavior. Kendi’s own experiences as a cancer survivor have informed his observations on this, he said. 
Kendi compared being held accountable for racism to being diagnosed with cancer. Despite receiving devastating news, patients still view the physician as someone who wants to help and view those who pushed them to ignore the problem, as if everything was okay, as not having their best interests at heart. 
“What if we as an American people stated that those people who are willing to diagnose racism in institutions and individuals are actually those who love us the most, are those who want us to get healing, are those who will actually make this nation great and these institutions great,” Kendi said.  
Rich offered a similar point of hope for members of the USC community that continue to work and fight towards institutional change, and a word of advice for those that may have seen the fight for equity and justice as divisive.
“Accountability is partially about love. You don’t try to hold people accountable unless you still care about them,” Rich said. “And so if that dynamic goes away, if people stop trying to hold folks accountable, it is a very bad sign to the institution.”

Long before he was the face of the Los Angeles Lakers, NBA superstar LeBron James left his home in Cleveland to join stars Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade on the Miami Heat — and instantly became the most hated athlete in American sports. 
James wasn’t the first to do it, but at the time, he was the most recent and by far the most popular athlete to leave his team for one with better talent in hopes of winning a championship. Since then, conversations about “superteams” and player movement have been commonplace (and mostly negative) in sports circles.
The current incarnation of the 2010s Heat is the 2021 Brooklyn Nets, and the NBA feels less exciting and less competitive than it did a year ago. 
The construction of the Nets was enabled by the power the players hold in the NBA. The NBA is a player’s league in comparison to other U.S. sports leagues, in which coaches and owners have more influence, and an individual player has less impact on a team’s success.
James did not start the era of superteams, he just made it seem like the only way to win was to pair multiple stars. James will be remembered for changing the formula for success in the NBA, but the reality is superstars stacking the deck has been a part of the NBA for years before James’ decision. 
There was the Boston Celtics’ “Big Three” in 2008. There was Karl Malone and Gary Payton joining Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal on the Lakers in 2004. There was former MVP Charles Barkley requesting to be traded to the back-to-back champion Houston Rockets in 1996. 
Even before there was free agency in basketball, Wilt Chamberlain demanded a trade to the Lakers in 1968. Players have known for a long time that teaming up with other great talent can result in championships. They knew back then, and they’ve tried to do it ever since. 
Of course the players should have a say in where they take their talent, but it doesn’t always create the best product for fans. The most extreme example of a superteam began in the summer of 2016, when superstar Kevin Durant left the Oklahoma City Thunder to join reigning MVP Stephen Curry on a Golden State Warriors team that had just won an NBA record 73 games in the regular season.
We know what happened next. It wasn’t very entertaining to watch an NBA season when you knew who would be holding the trophy in June. 
Here we are two years after Durant’s injury and the Warriors’ downfall, and the story is the same. Durant leads another star-studded team in Brooklyn, which was already a solid group before he and Irving signed in free agency two offseasons ago. 
When reigning scoring champion James Harden was unhappy in Houston and demanded a trade to a contender, he listed the Nets and Philadelphia 76ers as desirable locations. The Rockets’ hands were tied. Harden wasn’t buying in for another season with Houston; he didn’t even show up to training camp on time. They were forced to trade him, and Brooklyn had the assets. 
This brings us to this week, when Blake Griffin, once a dominant power forward in the NBA, makes his way to the Nets. Griffin is a six-time All-Star and was a critical piece of a Los Angeles Clippers team with high hopes several years ago. You might remember that team also featuring DeAndre Jordan, All-Star and now Brooklyn Nets center.
Griffin signed a five-year, $171 million contract with the Clippers in 2017 and was traded to the Detroit Pistons months later. But this year, Griffin decided he was done playing in Detroit, and the Pistons bought him out of his contract, making him a free agent. Griffin will still make $75.7 million over this season and next, and ended up in a favorable situation. 
He might not be in his prime, and Jordan might not be either, but Griffin is joining a lineup full of All-Stars and is being paid generously by Detroit to contend for a title in Brooklyn while his old team languishes in the lottery. 
In this case, Griffin got the best of all worlds, and what he left behind in Detroit is probably the worst team and situation in the NBA. On the other hand, the Nets have three of the best scorers in the NBA, and the projected lineup of Harden, Irving, Durant, Griffin and Jordan has a history of 32 combined All-Star appearances. 
I have no problem with Durant and Irving choosing to sign with a team as free agents. Even Durant signing with an elite Warriors team was technically by the book, although it also destroyed the competitive balance of the league for a few years. Same story with James choosing Miami as a free agent.
Players should choose where they want to play — that’s the point of free agency. But forcing a team to trade you where you want to go or sitting out until your team releases you is another conversation. We’ve seen this frequently over the past few years, and it’s getting out of hand. You should be obligated to uphold the contract you sign. 
So, the result is that there’s yet another superteam in the NBA, and it’s perhaps the most talented team ever put together. Brooklyn can easily have at least one superstar on the floor for all 48 minutes of a game. 
Unfortunately, it’s difficult to see the Nets doing anything other than dominating the league for the next couple of seasons. This was all possible because Harden got exactly what he wanted from Houston, and that’s the nature of the NBA today. It’s good for the players and bad for the product that is professional basketball.

The selfie-stick-waving, spray-tanned fashionistas of the social media world are perhaps the most inappropriate choice for government-sponsored propaganda. Yet, during the pandemic, Finland employed the influencer infantry to circulate information on the coronavirus on social media platforms.
In between hyperbolically beautiful posts of Lapland and the testing trials of getting an iced oat milk latte, Instagram stories branded with the hashtag “#faktaakoronasta” (or #factsaboutcoronavirus) informed followers of national guidelines. Armed solely with their iPhones, these ‘critical’ operators delivered sensitive information to the media-addicted youth, who are less likely to pay attention to traditional government communication methods. 
Consequently, Finland has 69.4 cases per 100,000 individuals as of March 10 for the last week. This is far lower than the United States, with its 121.2 per 100,000 case rate. In part, hiring influencers must have worked for Finland and should be considered in the U.S. However, the success of Finland’s influencer army relies on two fundamental factors that are not found in U.S. society: the size of the nation and public approval of influencers.
Finland’s population is only 5.5 million. This means that an influencer with 100,000 followers, for example, can impact a large proportion of citizens. However, to have the same influence in a country as expansive as the U.S., the influencer would need to have followers in the millions. Coupled with state-by-state inconsistencies in social distancing rules, it would be hard to manage and grow an influencer army powerful enough to change public perception in the U.S.
Furthermore, toxic cancel culture has transformed influencers into sources of controversy. This is not with undue cause — recent scandals include frat boy wannabe Bryce Hall throwing a TikTok rager mid-pandemic and the learned Kourtney Kardashian teaching us all that, apparently, blue surgical masks cause cancer. The behavior of these influencers makes it clear that influencers in the U.S. are inevitably contentious characters. 
If the U.S. government called in the Hollywood cavalry to spread information about the coronavirus, the pandemic may become unnecessarily socialized. Since these influencers are considered untrustworthy sources of information, becoming mouthpieces for the government may cast doubt on what actions to take in response to the virus. Moreover, thanks to the toxicity surrounding the Bryce Halls of the social media world, many will outright reject any information that comes from influencers, disincentivizing a safe coronavirus response team.
Yet, this hasn’t prevented some local governments from attempting to hire social media influencers recently. In the midst of the upcoming trials of the police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd, the Minneapolis City Council wanted to pay six social media stars $2,000 each to spread confirmed information about the high profile case. This plan was almost immediately scrapped because the influencers were accused of trying to change public opinion, despite presenting objective facts. This shows the extent of Americans’ distrust in social media and their automatic assumption that influencers are inauthentic.
Hence, the U.S.cannot unlock the potential of social media until it changes its influencers. 
Cancel culture fosters toxicity and controversy that clouds the actions of social media moguls, preventing them from having credible careers. As a result, the U.S. is unable to communicate with this new sector of its population, perhaps exacerbating the issue of the pandemic further. If the U.S. wants to tap into social media’s mass network, it needs to reinvent its influencers from the root.

In an age where mental health issues are at the forefront of many minds, senior Josie Bullen and alumna Zoe Brown are using social media to increase awareness and education on the matter. 
The Mental Health Content Collective took off as an organization within the last year, creating a space where people can discuss media representation of mental health to become more comfortable with personal mental health conversations and increase coverage of mental health. This spring, the Mental Health Content Collective became a registered student organization. 
“We saw a lack of accurate representation of mental health in the media,” Brown said. “The main focus right now is to have discussions about and spotlight different pieces of content that portray mental health and talk about why that’s important. We think that these discussions of mental health and media, which is sometimes easier to talk about than your own personal mental health, hopefully, makes it easier to then talk about personal mental health.”
Bullen, who is majoring in communication, said she considered starting the collective for years. However, the pandemic allowed for extra time to plan and create the organization, as well as an environment where even more people may need access to a space where they can talk about mental health.
Alison Trope, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the faculty advisor for the Mental Health Content Collective, said the stigma around mental health is decreasing with each generation.
“With the pandemic, too, you have people that may [have] never experienced mental health issues before having mental health issues,” Trope said.“I think that that is going to make people more aware, more sympathetic, empathetic and more engaged in the topic.” 
Bullen and Brown met at an Annenberg Career Track event at the Busy Phillips Show. On the bus, they began sharing stories about their own personal experiences with mental health and instantly became friends, bonding over their shared passion for mental health advocacy and media.
“We’ve bonded over talking about how we went through our own struggles with mental health, and we are both really passionate about entertainment so we thought how we can merge those two interests,” Bullen said. 
In addition to her passion for media, Brown said television helped bring her joy when she was going through a hard period in life and sees potential in using this as a technique to help others as well.
“Some of the shows that I was watching, like, ‘The Good Place’ and ‘This Is Us’ talked about mental health and made me feel less alone in my struggles and I think that it’s really important to have more content like that to help other people,” Brown said.  
Bullen and Brown said they were also inspired by the 2019 Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s “Mental Health Conditions in Film and TV” report. The study showed that despite 20% of the United States population struggling with mental illnesses, only 1.7% of characters in the top 100 films portrayed a mental health condition or illness. 
Their club objectives include creating a safe space for students to talk about mental health and media, listen to the others’ stories of their own experiences and ask questions about how students can make a difference in the professional realm of mental health. They have also had guest speakers, including NBC executives and mental health and body image speaker Victoria Garrick.
Bullen and Brown said they hope to eventually turn the Mental Health Content Collective into a nonprofit in the mental health and entertainment industry. 
“We are definitely dreamers, and we think the sky is the limit,” Bullen said. “We would also in the future love to become a nonprofit and have screenwriting contests that center around mental health and be able to give grants for different films.”
It’s been challenging to start a new student organization during the pandemic, particularly when it comes to resources, time and members, Brown said. However, being determined and working on the organization is an important first step on the road to creating their nonprofit. Brown and Bullen are currently planning more events, guest speakers and creating an open environment on campus. 
“I think the broader goal that they have is really to expand the way we see representation of mental health in mainstream media,” Trope said. ”Whether that’s in streaming content or films or different kinds of user generated content, how can we really explore stereotypes that we see … and possibly change them through new representations. Hopefully, they can have a kind of ripple effect and impact on various stakeholders that are in media industries or at large.”

In a criminal justice system that handles trauma with punishment, it can be hard to break out of stigma and rebuild a life. With incarceration itself being very traumatic, there are already so many people in prison incarcerated at a very young age or who have previously experienced unstable living situations. 
Post conviction, formerly incarcerated individuals can face a multitude of challenges such as difficulty landing internships or job opportunities, finding suitable housing and continuing their education. All of these factors can be linked to one question that many people have overlooked if it did not apply to them: Have you ever been convicted of a felony?
On Feb. 12, the USC Suzanne Dworack-Peck School of Social Work repealed the question asking prospective doctoral applicants to disclose previous felonies. The decision also followed the Master’s of Social Work programs removing the question in 2014 to promote the equity and inclusion of applicants with criminal records. 
The Unchained Scholars at the School of Social Work, working with their co-advisor and social work professor Susan Hess, and the admissions office, are taking steps to replace this question with inclusive and equitable language. The Unchained Scholars is a caucus composed of formerly incarcerated masters and doctoral students working with allies to dismantle the barriers faced by people impacted by the criminal punishment system.
This initiative works in tandem with the Ban the Box movement, a country-wide effort to repeal the felony question in all forms, including in housing, workplace and higher education. 
According to Root & Rebound, 70% of colleges in the United States ask applicants to reveal if they have a history of a felony conviction. Additionally, two-thirds of all applicants with a criminal record forgo their applications once they encounter this question. Although California will require all colleges to remove the felony question from undergraduate programs beginning 2021-2022 school year, professional degrees and graduate programs will be exempt. 
Like the School of Social Work, other universities in California and worldwide should make education more accessible to prospective students with criminal records by removing the felony question. 
Excluding people with criminal records from fair consideration for educational and job opportunities is harmful to marginalized communities, with Black, Latinx and transgender people disproportionately represented in the carceral system. Many people in marginalized communities are already disadvantaged and face barriers to the workplace and higher education. A miniscule check in the box for one specific question can be the kiss of death for their hopes and dreams, regardless of how qualified they are.
The felony question on many school and job applications has been widely contested in recent years. In 2016, former U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. urged colleges to no longer ask prospective students about previous felony convictions and sent the head of various universities across the country a guide to move “beyond the box.” However, schools such as New York University and Princeton University maintain that the question is a measure of safety and does not play a role in preliminary admission processes. 
While there has been some effort to make the application processes seemingly objective — as long as individuals are required to disclose their previous felony convictions — they will be subject to a stigma, and the process will never be fair to them. 
Society and the media perpetuate a stigma in regards to prisons and incarceration out of fear that the person will reoffend and cause harm in some way. This is psychologically harmful to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals, who then feel a lack of confidence and self doubt.
Misdemeanors and some felonies can be expunged from records in California to prevent the individual from being discriminated against during onboarding employment and higher education applications.
According to the Prison Policy Initiative, formerly incarcerated people are twice as likely not to have a high school education and eight times less likely to have a college education than their counterparts. Additionally, formerly incarcerated people are at rate five times higher for facing unemployment than their counterparts, which can also be linked to a lack of education. When a formerly incarcerated person makes a decision to further his or her education, we should support them and not pose any more barriers to their success. 
Education is a right, and formerly incarcerated people should be given equal consideration for opportunities to better themselves. Schools should eliminate the question about conviction history entirely, so that students are based on merit and fairness with no stigma involved. While their charges are unchangeable, that doesn’t mean that they aren’t capable of change.
To support the advancement of formerly incarcerated students and workers, who in many cases are also from marginalized communities, we can follow the guidance of Unchained Scholars, as they are the students that have experienced this themselves.
In a newsletter sent out Tuesday (issued Sept. 22, 2020), Unchained Scholars called on USC to expand their scope of initiatives to address systematic racism by addressing the role of the carceral system more directly, and openly address the needs of students who have experienced it first hand by offering scholarships and housing assistance. 
Unchained Scholars also asked USC to develop curricula that address educational and economic effects of incarceration and the carceral system as part of training materials for Student Equity and Inclusion Programs. In addition, they called for extending space to systems impacted students and expanding collaborative initiatives such as participatory research in Los Angeles County, which has the largest jail population in the world.
Students who are formerly incarcerated bear an unfair stigma that prevents them from advancing and moving forward with their life. Formerly incarcerated students are strong and have persevered through far more than anyone could imagine. We must celebrate their perseverance rather than oppress it. We should recognize the accomplishment of someone who was incarcerated to overcome the barriers they faced and do incredible work after gaining admission to an elite school such as USC. 
Writer’s note: I would like to thank Deirdre Wilson, Susan Hess and Yehudah Pryce, who are part of the Unchained Scholars, Ernst Fenelon Jr. from the Prison Education Project and Susan Bustamante from the California Coalition for Women Prisoners for sharing their incredible efforts and perspectives about prison reform and equitable education for formerly incarcerated students.

It was middle school, and during an impassioned speech about who knows what, one of my close friends, who’s Black, turns to me and says, “Period!” That wasn’t out of the ordinary, especially for a Black girl in 2014, but I’ll never forget the look of disgust my white peers had on their faces when they overheard it. I was confused, but this was also around the same time I was told by a white classmate, “Marlize, you aren’t like them” — referring to my Black friends — “You don’t talk like you’re ghetto.” 
Well, what exactly did that mean? That these Black friends in honors-level classes were uneducated? To me, that’s just how Black people communicated, and either way, by age 13, I was already code-switching, which I’ll talk about later. But, hey, who would’ve thought years later this same way of speech would be popularized and considered the official lingo of Gen Z.
I find that a lot of these phrases like “cap,” “spill the tea” and “extra” are found in internet communities such as Twitter and TikTok, but what must be understood is that it started as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). 
For decades, Black people have shortened and invented words to not only communicate but to build community. So, when white influencers like Brittany “Kombucha Girl” Tomlinson associate words like “sis,” “period” and “snatch” to the language of internet culture, it erases the importance of the language.
The internet is so widely used, though, that AAVE has found its way into the vocabulary of non-Black people. A recent example is Sarah Paulson pronouncing the word “period” (often written as “periodt”) as “period T” in an Instagram live. 
It wasn’t Paulson’s fault that she mispronounced this phrase, many non-Black people do, but that’s because there isn’t proper education on it. Some watchers even confused her pronunciation with the phrase, “period tea.” When people see a phrase used over and over again in mass media, in most cases, it becomes a trend and doesn’t receive the proper attention to its historical context as it should.
Similarly to the video of Paulson, in 2018, there was a viral video of a Black man asking his white friend how she pronounces, “Whew chile,” — where the “d” in “child” is replaced with an “e” — to where she responded with “whew chil-ay.”
What makes the integration of AAVE into Gen Z language so upsetting, though, is that for years Black language has been mocked, parodied and associated with stigmas like lack of education. Non-Black Gen Z members integrating AAVE into their everyday language, while Black people are stigmatized, conceals the prejudice people have toward the language and exemplifies their ignorance on the topic. Especially when its usage has gone so far as to label Black people as less ambitious and less qualified for jobs which leads to something most Black people are familiar with: code-switching. 
Code-switching is a way for Black people to navigate white spaces by optimizing comfort via changing their speech, expression, etc. in order to receive fair treatment, quality service and employment opportunities. 
This is used so often, it’s been satirized in many Black television shows and movies. In the ’90s sitcom, “Martin,” the show’s namesake (Martin Lawrence) is seen convincing a 911 operator he is a white man by over-enunciating his words and answering questions like, “What America’s favorite pie is?” (It’s apple by the way.) It’s also seen in the 2018 film, “Sorry to Bother You,” where Cassius Greene (LaKeith Stanfield) finds little success as a telemarketer using his real voice, so he adopts a “white voice,” and his calls go through the roof. While many think the reason they don’t understand the words used today is because they aren’t in tune with the youth — there’s even a makeshift “Gen Z Dictionary” for it — they’re mistaken. It’s because, in most cases, it isn’t their culture to begin with. The use of AAVE by non-Black people can be a game of either cultural appropriation or cultural fusion, and with the correct background knowledge, it can be the latter. So for those who have taken the time to peruse this piece, I hope you have been enlightened by my composition. Periodt.

Since the release of its first film in 2018, the “To All the Boys” series has been one of Netflix’s most popular releases worldwide. The teen romance series, focusing on the story of Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), wrapped up with its final installment, “To All the Boys: Always and Forever,” released Feb. 12. On Tuesday, the School of Cinematic Arts hosted a Q&A with several members of the cast and crew over Zoom.
The panelists included director and director of photography Michael Fimognari, screenwriter Katie Lovejoy and executive producer Robyn Marshall, all alumni of SCA. Additionally, actresses Anna Cathcart (Kitty), Madeleine Arthur (Chris) and Emilija Baranac (Genevieve) were also present. The conversation was moderated by SCA’s director of programming, Alex Ago.
The first topics of the discussion centered around the adaptation of the film, both from the original book written by Jenny Han, and from the other installments in the trilogy. Katie Lovejoy talked about her writing process, stating that she wanted the film to feel thematically similar to the rest of the trilogy, but also represent the characters growing up and maturing.
“The characters are growing up and the stakes are getting more real and more grounded,” Lovejoy said, while discussing how the third film explores the characters tackling mature topics like college decisions and the start of the rest of their lives. 
Lovejoy also brought up how each film in the series follows a love triangle, but the love triangle in the last film is Lara Jean’s choice between Peter or New York City. She must choose between going to University of California, Berkeley to be close to Peter, or forging her own path by going to New York University. Lovejoy believes this shows maturity in Lara Jean while also staying true to the original storylines of the other films.
Fimognari, having worked as the director of photography on all three films and directing the final two, discussed how he maintained a consistent visual look throughout the trilogy.
“It was important to me as a director that you’d be able to push play on the first and see it evolve and see the characters grow up but also feel like you’re contained in the same world,” he said. 
Fimognari stated that the greatest arc in the series is in the relationship between Lara Jean and Genevieve, as they slowly evolve from rivals to friends and end up attending the same college. Emilija Baranac also touched on this relationship, stating that she was happy to see that her character and Lara Jean had become “two women that can come together and just talk.” 
Baranac revealed that a scene in which Gen knocks on the door of Lara Jean’s dorm room was cut from the film, but she wishes it had stayed in to show the possibility of them forming a friendship.
The actresses all touched on their experiences with comedy on set, and how Fimognari allowed them to improvise some of their own comedic moments, such as in the montage when the characters explore New York City. They also had a role in choosing what their characters wore in the film, particularly for each character’s prom look. 
Audience member Ann Vu asked the actresses where they saw their characters’ lives going after the end of the film. Arthur said that she believes Chris is a free spirit who won’t settle down for a while, but she also thinks she might end up in the music industry. Cathcart said that Kitty will probably become the student council president in high school and will continue to not let anyone push her around. Baranac believes that Gen and Lara Jean will be friends in college and that Gen might end up working with kids or giving back in some other way.
Each audience member that asked a question prefaced their question by telling the cast and crew how much this series meant to them. It’s a series that reached young audiences around the world and while the series is over, it’s clear that it will continue to captivate audiences and cement its role as a classic teen romance.
“To All the Boys: Always and Forever” is streaming on Netflix now.
