Every time he dives into the pool, senior water polo captain James Walters carries his brother, Jon, with him.
Jon’s initials, JDW, are emblazoned on James’ cap, suit and sweats. A plaque memorializing Jon, a 2-meter who was key to the Trojans’ national championship victory in 2013, hangs on the wall alongside the supporters’ section where James’ parents, Jaque and Bill, sit in the stands. 
Jon’s name is engraved in the NCAA championship ring that hangs on a chain around Jaque’s neck. She clutches at the pendant, running her thumb over the letters, when a game comes down to the wire.
Bill has a ring of his own, as do Jon’s older siblings. It’s one of their favorite memories of Jon — a true freshman, still recovering from an elbow injury, who squared his jaw to lift USC to a victory.
James is the only one without a ring. When his family ordered them four years ago, he refused to accept one of his own. He didn’t want to take Jon’s ring. James needed to earn his own.
For three years since, James has been looking to redeem his brother’s championship. For three years, his team fought its way to a No. 1 ranking, to an MPSF title, to the national championship title game. And for three straight years, the Trojans have fallen just short. 
This weekend is his last chance to change that. And for James, this weekend means more than just redemption. Because four years ago, after winning the national championship, Jon fell into a coma after a New Year’s party. He battled pneumonia and a series of heart attacks before dying eight days later. He was 19, a freshman and a national champion. He was also James’ best friend.
This weekend, James will captain his team in its final national title run. But he’ll play for more than just a title or a trophy. He’ll play for his brother, for the final time. And he’ll play for a ring of his own.
“I think, at the end of it, I want to make him proud,” James said. “I know he’s proud of me, but I still want to do this for him. I want to finish what he started.”
Arm in arm
For most of their lives, it was always assumed that Jon and James were twins.
They had the same strong frame — broad shoulders, long arms, square jaws. Jon wore glasses, and James was an inch shorter. They were separated in age by a year, yet it was rare to see them apart.
In and out of the water, Jon and James were the perfect pair. Jon was hot-headed, stubborn, quick to act first and think later. Despite being younger, James was the mature one. He woke Jon up in the mornings and reminded him to not forget his glasses or notes on the way to school. They lived in a four-bedroom house and insisted on sharing the same room. Neither one really seemed to make sense without the other.
Even their positions were complementary: James played utility, the polo version of a point guard, feeding the ball to Jon down low in the 2-meter slot. They never felt the need to compete because their roles in the pool were a perfect fit — designed to assist one another. 
Sometimes, James remembers, he didn’t even have to look at his brother when they were in the pool. He knew where he’d be, how he’d move, which play to run. In three seasons together at Mater Dei High School, the pair never lost a game.
“You had to be on their team because if you weren’t, you were going to lose,” said senior goalkeeper McQuin Baron, who has played with the Walterses since freshman year of high school. “If Jon and James were on a team, they were winning. They were unstoppable together.”
They were on each other’s teams from the start, although their athletic careers began on the football field. Bill played defensive line at the University of Kansas, so he signed the boys up for Pop Warner, hoping they’d follow his love for the game. 
They took to it immediately, as most little boys do, except for one problem — Jon’s size. He was a stocky kid, tall for his age and thick around the middle, and he needed to drop 35 pounds to play in his own age group. Bill knew it was impossible, so he walked the boys home, determined to find something else.
The answer came in that short walk, as the trio walked past water polo practice at the pool of their recreation center. Jon pointed at the splashing players and asked if they could join. Within a week, Jon and James were water polo converts.
They grew up in the game, spending every afternoon in the pool, reeking of chlorine and gobbling down sandwiches and In-N-Out between swim and water polo practices. James never considered being on a different team than Jon, so he played up an age group for the next five years. 
Bill and Jaque knew the boys would always be good at whatever they tried, and it was true from the start. The pair joined a club team that soon traveled the country and secured a national title. They won state championships in high school and declared for USC together during Jon’s junior year. For both of them, water polo just made sense.
“We just got so caught up with it from the beginning,” James said. “When I think of growing up, I just think of the pool with Jon. It was our everyday, and it just never got old. It still hasn’t.”
Jon’s freshman year both started and ended with tragedy. He injured his elbow within weeks of the first game, grinding a promising start to the season to a halt. As Jon warmed the bench and recovered from his injury, James adjusted to life without his brother. They saw each other on the weekends and talked on the phone, but the distance made things different.
Without his brother by his side, James lost the first game of his high school career. But it was alright, he said, because next year he would be at USC. They’d play together and win a championship. Just as planned.
Jon recovered in time for postseason play, netting 2 goals in an NCAA semifinal to push the Trojans into the final game. On Dec. 8, James was in the stands watching as Jon won the national title in an overtime thriller over Pacific. It was the sixth straight national championship for USC. 
Afterwards, Jon hugged his brother, grinning widely as they celebrated the first of many trophies. The celebration continued weeks later, on New Year’s Eve back in Newport Beach. Jon, who struggled with insomnia for years, took Xanax before heading to a party with his brother. They drank champagne and fell asleep, like always, side by side. But that morning, Jon didn’t wake up.
For a week, Jon remained in a coma. On the third day, he contracted pneumonia. On the eighth day, he suffered a series of heart attacks. He died on Jan. 8, at the age of 19, exactly a month after winning the national championship.
“It was devastating for all of us,” Bill said. “It’s like a fog. It fills you and surrounds you, and you don’t know how you’re going to get out of it. I think we’re just waking up now. Years later, I think we’re still just waking up.”
For James, the weeks following Jon’s death felt hollow. He forgot, almost every day, that his brother was gone. Remembering again was the hardest part. When James graduated that spring, Jon wasn’t there to see it. He wasn’t there to help him move into his college dorm, or to shove him underwater in his first practice as a Trojan. And in the weeks following his brother’s death, James became accustomed to firsts without Jon.
With the last of her children away at college, the house was too quiet for Jaque. James knew that, so he called his mom every day, letting her know how his day was going. It wasn’t quite enough to fill the space that four children left in her home. But it helped.
In the time that passed, water polo allowed the Walters to heal. The team dedicated its season to Jon, emblazoning his initials on every piece of official polo gear. Head coach Jovan Vavic promised Bill and Jaque that the team would treat James like family. To memorialize Jon, he hung a plaque permanently in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
The family dove into the game again with a new sort of passion. Bill and Jaque refused to miss a game, cooking dinner for the players and their families after every match. And James quietly followed in the promising steps of his brother, scoring 34 goals as a true freshman. 
“I think that’s when you need the game,” James said. “There’s a comfort to it, you know, to it being something that has always been here for me. I found so much comfort in my team and in the pool, especially in that first year when I needed it.”
Four years later, the Walters love to talk about Jon.
Not in public. That freaks people out, Bill says. It’s awkward. Other people don’t know what to say, how to act. There’s nothing for a friend or a stranger to say when a family casually brings up their boy who died too soon.
But when they’re alone together, the Walters talk about Jon. What he would say or think in a situation. A joke he would probably crack, the line he would probably fall for, the advice he would probably give.
“I don’t go an hour without thinking of him,” Bill says, and Jaque shakes her head in agreement. “Not an hour.”
They moved several years ago, to a lavish house overlooking the ocean by Crystal Cove. Jon never lived here, but it’s hard to tell. Pictures of him and James cover the wall of a hallway. Family portraits, awkward poses after water polo games, a faded picture of the pair back before they lost their baby fat. Jon’s obituary, which filled the cover of the Daily Trojan four years ago, hangs in between.
“There’s no new pictures, so we have to cherish all the old ones,” Jaque says, running her hand across a framed picture of Jon when he was young, his curly blonde hair falling into his eyes. “He died, and there’s no new pictures. It’s just memories.”

Moving forward, not moving on
James never planned for a life without Jon.
He knew, in detail, what he wanted from life. He wanted to play in the Olympics alongside his brother. He wanted to graduate USC, start a real estate business with his siblings and father. He wanted to buy a house with Jon living right next door, so the pair could eat dinner, get married, raise their children together. When he thought about the future, he thought about ending each day of work by going home with his brother and best friend.
For the first 20 years of their lives, Jon and James were two halves, two pieces of a puzzle. Now, it’s been three years and James is still getting used to being on his own.
It’s amazing, Baron says, because if you meet James now, you’d never knew what he went through. He’s warm, friendly — the type of guy who is quick to help and easy to laugh. In the pool, he’s still the same as before, fierce on defense and calculating on offense. He’s a true captain, Baron says, the guy everyone else wants to follow.
James is still living the life he and Jon had dreamed. He’ll graduate this year as a two-year captain and go into business with his family, just as planned. He’ll still buy a house and raise a family, just without his brother next door. But there’s one dream that James won’t let himself live. 
When they were young, Jon and James were expected to become a star duo for the U.S. national team, natural athletes who traveled along with Baron with the Olympic development teams throughout high school. Now, James turns down any invitations to the team. Baron now plays for the U.S. on his own, the final remainder of the trio from high school.
After college, James will leave water polo behind. The Olympic team might have allowed him to play for years into the future, but now, he’s OK with his time in the pool coming to an end. That was their dream, not his.
But for now, there’s still a few more games to play. If James has his way, his career will end on Sunday, in the pool dedicated to his brother.
Most of this team didn’t know Jon. For them, this weekend is a chance at redemption for their seniors, at revenge against Cal and UCLA teams that have upset them in the past. But for the team that has become a family for James, every player knows the weight that a championship would hold.
Win or lose this weekend, James will play for his team and his family, for his brother and for the ring he feels he still must earn. And win or lose, Jon will be watching from the best seat in the house.
“There’s still days where it hits me in waves and I’m not sure how I’m going to do it,” James said. “But you just keep doing it. You move forward. You don’t move on.”

Senior goalie McQuin Baron looks to conclude his Trojan career with a national title as USC begins the NCAA Tournament this week. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
For the 13th year in a row, the No. 4 men’s water polo team will be competing in the NCAA Tournament, beginning with a matchup against No. 15 Harvard on Thursday. 
This year, third-seeded USC will host the tournament at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The team has won six titles in its previous 31 tournament appearances and is looking to add to that number this year. The last time the Trojans hosted the tournament, they came away with the trophy. Cal hosted in 2016 and claimed the title.
“The last two or three years, the host of the tournament has always won,” senior goalie McQuin Baron said. “So hopefully that’s the case this year.”
For the Trojans, this tournament is more than just another appearance, as they seek their first national title since 2013 — the last championship in USC’s unprecedented six-year winning streak. After suffering heartbreak in the championship match last season, USC put 2016 out of its mind and started this season with its eyes on the prize.
“I don’t think losing had anything to do with our prep this year,” Baron said. “We just want to bring it home. We’ve kind of just been focusing on the games earlier in the season and what we need to do to win this weekend.”
The Trojans have been preparing for this tournament all season. Coming into the tournament with a 25-3 overall record and winning the MPSF Tournament championship title over UCLA last weekend, the team has the momentum and the desire. However, the players also know they must keep improving before facing any teams this weekend.
“I think it is a big confidence-builder to be able to beat [No. 3 UCLA and No. 1 Stanford], especially by the margins we did,” Baron said. “But looking back at the film, we saw a bunch of mistakes that we can fix and capitalize on this weekend.”
Some of the mistakes the Trojans are looking to fix were from games where victory came after some nervous moments. Though the team hopes to avoid similar nail-biters in the postseason, the close calls actually were a way for the Trojans to practice handling tougher situations and learning how to perform under pressure.
“We have had a lot of close games this year — I think more so than any other year,” Baron said. “We had double-overtime with Long Beach [State], we had a close game with UC [Irvine] and almost lost to them once. So I think the amount of close games and pressure situations we’ve had this year are really going to help us in the tail end of the season.”
For Baron, who is three saves shy of taking the MPSF all-time career saves leader title with 1,055, his final tournament appearance is the culmination of his time at USC. Even with all Baron has accomplished during his Trojan career — from winning the Cutino Award last season to representing Team USA at the 2016 Olympics — the one accolade he has left to add to his trophy cabinet is a national title. But in his last season before graduating, Baron has been pushing himself to continue to improve.
“For me personally, the hardest thing to overcome is that I think this is one of my worst seasons I’ve had at USC,” Baron said. “I mean, if you look at the stat line, obviously not, but [that’s] how I personally felt. I think there were only two or three times I played badly in big games, but that can have a huge effect on you.”
Baron said he was focused on “overcoming that on the confidence side” and making minor adjustments to bring him back to his best. But Baron also said he was still excited to reach this point in the season. For Baron and the other seniors, this weekend will determine the last mark they will leave on the program. The quarterfinal against Harvard also marks one of the final steps they have to take before reaching the ultimate goal  — and the Trojans can almost taste it.
“Every year you’re kind of looking forward to this point, and it’s finally here,” Baron said. “I’m a senior, along with the 13 others, and we’ve been training four years for this moment. It is our last collegiate water polo weekend. Hopefully we make it to the finals and come out on top.”
The Trojans begin their championship chase against the Crimson 7 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. With a victory, USC will advance to face Cal in the semifinals on Saturday. The championship match will be held on Sunday at 3 p.m.

Redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins will look to keep Stanford’s offense bottled up once again this Friday. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
As No. 10 USC prepares to face No.12 Stanford for the fifth time in three years, some of the veteran Trojan players reflected on the last time they clashed with the Cardinal in a Pac-12 Championship. 
After going 5-2 as interim head coach in 2015, Clay Helton was promoted to permanent head coach leading up to the conference title game. It was a move that delighted the roster, but ultimately, the team was unable to deliver, losing to Stanford 41-22. 
“We were head over heels for him, but at the same time, we didn’t come out and perform like we wanted to,” redshirt senior safety and defensive captain Chris Hawkins said.
USC now seeks redemption two years later, with the program in a much more stable position than before. In his first two full seasons, Helton has gone 20-5 with a Rose Bowl victory and a Pac-12 South title. After two brief, yet controversial tenures turned in by former head coaches Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian, it was the un-flashy, unflappable Helton who brought USC back to national prominence. Yet in order to silence all doubt that he was the right hire in 2015, and cement this season as a successful one, Helton requires one more win at Levi’s Stadium this Friday.
“I feel like last year if we would’ve went [to the Pac-12 Championship], we would’ve won it then too, and I feel like everybody in the country thought the same thing,” Hawkins said. “But this is a big step moving forward for this program and Coach Helton as well.”
Playing Stanford is always a difficult task, with its hard-hitting, physical style of play on both sides of the ball. Playing the Cardinal twice in the same season is even tougher. In the two teams’ first meeting in Week 2, USC trounced Stanford, winning by three touchdowns and rushing for over 300 yards. At the time, even Helton was surprised at the way his squad man-handled a David Shaw-coached team. 
But this Friday, the Trojans are expecting a different Cardinal squad. They’ve finally settled on K.J. Costello as starting quarterback, and the returns have been encouraging. He’s thrown for nine scores and just two interceptions, with an efficient four-touchdown performance against Notre Dame last week being his career highlight. Shaw won’t ask Costello to do too much against USC; at the very least, he provides balance to an offense that placed too much pressure on Heisman-hopeful running back Bryce Love early on. 
There is perhaps no other college football player more valuable to his team than Love is for Stanford (in the one game he’s missed all year, Stanford struggled to beat lowly, 1-11 Oregon State). When healthy, he’s one of the best athletes in the nation. When hurt — which he has been for nearly all of November — he’s still one of the best athletes in the nation. The junior is averaging 115 yards per game since suffering an ankle sprain, proving that he possesses durability to match his explosiveness. He’s been an essential ingredient in his team’s three-game, Pac-12 North-clinching run to close out the season. 
“I’ve been impressed with him all season,” Hawkins said. “Usually, you think it’s the O-line that’s doing the job, but he’s really making people miss now.” 
Much like USC’s offense, which churned out over 600 total yards against Stanford in September, the defense also wouldn’t mind a repeat performance. Save for a 75-yard touchdown run in the first quarter (which the coaching staff chalked up to an alignment issue), the unit did a nice job of containing Love, forcing Stanford to throw: The Cardinal’s 28 pass attempts are the second-most they have thrown all year.
To again prevent Love from taking over the game, USC will rely on senior nose tackle Josh Fatu (eight tackles for loss) to clog up holes inside and hope inside linebackers redshirt sophomore John Houston Jr. and junior Cam Smith are able to wrap him up in open-field situations.
“You try to make the quarterback win the game because runners and offensive linemen rarely have bad days,” Helton said. “Sometimes you’ll catch a quarterback having a bad day, but when you force a team to be one-dimensional, it’s a lot harder to move the ball.”
For the offense, the group’s biggest transformation since Week 2 is redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s improved chemistry with his receiving corps. Over the past few weeks, redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. have gone from afterthoughts to bonafide offensive weapons. Their emergence helped Darnold rattle off three of his best performances of the season following the loss to Notre Dame before the offense sputtered against UCLA (the Bruins rank 123rd in FBS total defense). The group will need both the passing game and the ground attack — behind junior running back Ronald Jones II (1,346 yards) — to fire on all cylinders and down Stanford for the second time in 2017. 
“Our skill positions have so much improved,” Helton said. “From a Tyler Vaughns developing to a Michael Pittman coming onto the scene, plus the health of some guys.”
A win in Santa Clara on Friday would be USC’s first conference title victory since 2008. Since the Pac-12 Championship’s inception in 2011, a Pac-12 South team has yet to win the game, while Stanford has won three of the six Pac-12 titles. 
In USC’s last appearance in the Pac-12 Championship the program was in a state of flux, but in Helton’s return to Levi’s Stadium with the team back in the national spotlight, the pressure is heightened.
“The expectations when you’re at USC are championships,” Helton said. “I knew that going in.”

The women’s volleyball team (22-9) earned the 10th seed in the 2017 NCAA Tournament, and the Women of Troy will take on Central Arkansas (27-4) at the Galen Center in their first-round matchup. This season marks USC’s 35th all-time appearance in the tournament and its 27th consecutive berth.
The Trojans host the Southland Conference champion Sugar Bears at 7 p.m. on Friday night. The winner will advance to the second round, which begins at 5 p.m. on Saturday. The victor of that match moves onto regionals. 
USC is 17-3 all-time in tournament matches at the Galen Center. In 2015, the Women of Troy started their regional run after winning their first- and second-round matches at home. Last season, the team traveled out to Minneapolis, where it fell in five sets to Hawaii. The loss marked just the fifth time USC did not advance out of the first round — and the first time since 1989.
“The best thing for us is not having to travel,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We wanted to make sure this year that we gave the best effort we could to host the first and second rounds. We’ve been able to accomplish that, so now we should focus and see if we can play as well as we can play.”
Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier spearheads USC’s attack: She was one of two Women of Troy who were named to the Pac-12 All-Conference Team.
Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie was the other player named to the All-Conference team. For both players, it was their second time being named to the All-Conference team. 
“I think at this point, it’s so far and late in the season, there’s not much we can do to get better, necessarily, but we just kind of have to maintain the high level that we’re at,” Lanier said.
Lanier emphasized that the team has been continuing to get reps in the gym during practice, working on its chemistry and overall cleaning up its play to avoid making errors. She said the team focused on working hard and going all-out every single time. Haley echoed her sentiments.
“The practices have been very good this week,” Haley said. “We’ve been working really hard on various aspects of our game, plus we’re trying to improve what we do.”
USC has faced 12 teams that also made this season’s tournament. In the 18 matches they played against these teams, the Women of Troy went 11-7. 
The team’s main focus right now remains Central Arkansas. This is the first time the teams will be playing each other. 
“We’ve seen tape on [Central Arkansas], and they’re a good team,” Haley said. “They control the ball well, they play hard [and] they’re well-coached, so we’ll just take them one at a time.”
To win the national championship — which USC hasn’t done since claiming back-to-back titles in 2002 and 2003 — the Women of Troy must win six matches as they move through the bracket composed of 64 teams.
“We want to try win six matches here,” Haley said. “The first one is Central Arkansas, so we have to only think about those people and make sure that we’re ready.”

As we reach the end of the season, I’ve become more and more grateful for head football coach Clay Helton.
I’ve griped about Helton a good amount throughout this season, believe me. If I hear him repeat the phrase, “We control our own destiny,” one more time, I might just go out of my mind. And when I look at our rankings in the College Football Playoff one week before the end of the season, I can’t get that dismal line of thought — the litany of different “what if” questions — out of my head.
There’s a lot that can be blamed on Helton for the struggles of this season. Our deputy sports editor Trevor Denton touched on the mishandling of key injuries, such as those of sophomore linebacker Porter Gustin, that have held up players on both sides of the ball this season. There have been poor play calls on offense, struggles with redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s ability to stay cool in the pocket.
But the end of Helton’s second full season as our head coach, I still believe that we’ve found a keeper.
I felt this the most strongly on Sunday as I watched the Tennessee football program self destruct. The program, which has struggled in recent years, announced the hire of head coach Greg Schiano.
Within hours, a Twitter mob had formed. Schiano was accused of involvement but legally cleared in the Penn State case against Jerry Sandusky, and although this accusation hadn’t affected him in past positions, Tennessee fans became incensed at the hiring decision. At breakneck speed, Schiano’s offer was revoked, and Tennessee’s football program was left floundering even more than before.
In moments like this, I’m proud to have a man like Helton in charge of our football program. There’s a reason that his players talk about him with that tell-tale tone of protective admiration.  Helton is everything you want out of a coach: stable, humble and passionate about his players. 
If his approach to his team isn’t enough for you, his 20-5 record over his first two seasons outflanks that of Pete Carroll, who went 17-8. Helton might not have stood up to this year’s preseason hype, but I think the numbers reflect that he’s doing alright.
At the end of the season, we are still looking forward to the Pac-12 championship game. And while it may not have been what we expected, I think that’s something for which to be grateful.

Graduate students participating in a national walkout gathered at Tommy Trojan on Wednesday to protest a provision that would raise taxes on graduate students by almost 400 percent. Kyle Kawaguchi | Daily Trojan
Gathering around Tommy Trojan on Wednesday morning, hundreds of graduate students and professors rallied to oppose provisions in the House of Representatives’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Some held signs demonstrating their opposition, while others chanted “Kill this bill!” and “Fight on!” in Hahn Plaza. 
The provisions the crowd opposed would raise taxes on graduate students by almost 400 percent, according to the Grad Tax Walkout website. 
The Grad Tax Walkout, a national protest, was planned and organized by five USC graduate students: Hannah Khoddam, Nina Jhaveri, Marie Gillespie, Hannah Rasmussen and Miriam Rubenson. They are all clinical psychology students pursuing doctorate degrees.
Since the USC students put the plan into action, hundreds of students attending 50 universities spanning 32 states registered to participate. The proposed tax bill, which passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago with only Republican support, would change the current law that allows graduate students to receive free tuition without being taxed. The new bill, if signed into law, would reclassify free tuition as income, which can be taxed.    
This prospect has left many graduate students, who often earn little income on top of receiving free tuition, worried about not being able to afford to continue their higher education. 
“If this bill passes, I don’t know if I will continue my [doctorate degree] — and this is my dream,” said Mariel Bello, a first-generation college student studying in the clinical science program. 
Bello ran a photo campaign table during the Grad Tax Walkout at Tommy Trojan on Wednesday.  Bello sat behind a foldable table ,helping students, faculty and general passers-by fill out signs explaining why their tuition waiver was important.
The table was filled with write-in signs with examples of what graduate students do: provide free services to veterans, work to cure cancer and provide therapy to low-income children in the community.
“Ultimately, I’m here to provide an avenue for students to fight against this bill,” Bello said of the rally’s photo campaign, which helped gain social media traction for the movement.
Stanley Huey, an associate professor of psychology and American studies and ethnicity, was one of the first speakers to kick off the event. He spoke to the crowd about his own experience as a graduate student.
 “I got a very modest stipend because the government was investing in me,” Huey said. “Debates at the time were how you opened up access, how you increased opportunities for students to get a good education. But the House bill is the inverse of that.”
Following Huey, her adviser, Gillespie marched up to the steps of Tommy Trojan with a bullhorn and instructed protesters to pull out their cell phones. Several hundred protesters pulled phones out of pockets and backpacks, as she instructed everyone to take a picture or video of the event. 
“I need you to post [that] on social media,” Gillespie said. “Do it loudly, do it proudly. We are higher education and we will not be taken away from America!”
Gillespie encouraged rally participants to approach the surrounding tables, which were organized around different themes to help individuals get involved. 
One table hosted a phone bank and laid out step-by-step instructions about how to call state senators and representatives, as well as a word-for-word script on what to say. 
Graduate students also circled the crowd with clipboards and laptops, aiming to get signatures on appropriate petitions. 
“I think this is hopefully the beginning of something,” Lyden said of the event. “Graduate students across the nation, I think, are a great group. If we can come together to fight something so absurd, we should keep going.”
Once again this current group of young people want more freebies while the rest of us pay the bill.  Free food, sex without marriage and unrestrained licentiousness without judgement.   
I pay taxes, lots and lots of taxes because the Lord has blessed my family with his grace.  I have written checks to the US Treasury (not the IRS for you that don’t pay any taxes) that would make many people gag in disbelief.   I would much rather take the blessings my family receives and pass those funds directly to those in real need.  Instead my money passes through the hands of our immoral government and subsidizes new i-phones and spring break vacations for those unwilling to pay anything on their own behalf.
Regardless, I am going to pray for all of you!
God Bless!
You seem to be ignorant of what is actually going on here. Nobody is asking for freebies.
Not paying taxes while others must is a “freebie”.  
I’m sure you have a nice phone and expensive sunglasses.
My son and I are both going to pray for you!
God Bless!
Many grad students go to school because they are offered a tuition waiver. This is not income. Your assumptions about me are wrong as well. You are sick.
What is sick is your self imposed entitlement. Grow up.
You can’t  explain away the inadequacies of your arguments by calling the younger generation entitled while simultaneously ignoring how pampered your generation was.
Examples of the baby boomer pampering?
Pampering is not the best word. Comparatively, boomers had it much easier when they were coming of age (economically). Riding progressive reforms from the 1930’s and the post-war boom, boomers had strong unions, higher labor share, higher real wages, affordable schooling, affordable health care (for-profit health care was illegal until the Nixon administration), and affordable housing. Considering housing, LA’s median home value in 1996 was $163,800. Using the BLS inflation calculator that comes out to $252,811 in 2017. The median cost of housing stock in LA in July 2017 was $589,000. Even during the recession it only dipped to $369,200.
I don’t know Mr. Katman but he seems much better at making a point than you Ms. Satriale.   I assume you are a woman but you never know these days.
God Bless!
Fight On.
Your statement is based on generalities.
You can refuse to accept that millenials face a tougher economic climate but my statements are based on economic reports and data. If you google anything related to this you can find hundreds of reports. Keep your head in the sand
Pampered?  Perhaps there are some, but most people I know had to work for our successes.  The younger gens want it provided for them.  I have first-hand knowledge of such behavior and requirements from the Millenials….. though not all M’s are crybabies, but most are.  Just watch the news.
Stop with the “I am going to pray for you” BS… You sound exactly like the Pharisees that Jesus mentioned on how NOT to pray. Keep your rat infested prayers to yourself, you self-righteous Delphic priestess.
I’m sorry that you have such anger toward me and my family’s faith.
I’m going to make a special prayer for you tomorrow at church.
God Bless!
The whole point of this tax bill is to out everyone on solid ground all to be treated as fairly as possible. Free tuition is a benefit that others don’t get so why should you be n somspexial. If you cannot afford to pay tuition, get loans grants and scholarships to help what you can pay.  If you tried to get public assistance for foods stamps, housing subsidies, etc… you’d find that your free tuition is considered income and you won’t qualify.  This has been going on for decades and is nothing new.
What you should be protesting is not the fact that the government wants to reclassified the free tuition as income,but that the high cost of getting an education in this country has skyrocketed because the feds have ex been subsidizing your cost of tuition. 
USC amongst most universities have outrageous costs to attend the university, except when they provided that info M to the NCAA, during the discussi I ns abiut paying student athletes a subsidy to help with the cost of attending the university.  USC undervalued that number so much that USC get less than half of that benefit than student athletes at the University of Tennessee.   Give me a break.  You guys are protesting the wrong entity. It is the university that you should protest, for enacting the highest fees in the world, rather than the federal government. …  this n sin why the feds are pulling out of augmenting the out of control university cost of education.  Get loans, grants, academic scholarships.  Free education?  You know better than that.  Nothing is free.
This adds tax burdens to poor graduate students who are working for the school on top of their studies. Many will be forced to stop attending their respective programs. The U.S. will have less people with advanced degrees. You are incredibly misinformed.
No. not misinformed.  Perhaps you should pursue your PhD certification from a university that provides for the same or similar research for your doctorate, but without the heavy burden of paying income taxes on the assessed value of the free tuition.  Or protest the university to stop increasing tuition fees.  Nikias is all about fund raising and the high cost of tuition does not have to happen.  USC can certainly reduce the cost of tuition, but then that wouldn’t be cool in the eyes of university presidents who are always trying to outdo one another.
Everybody has to pay taxes, so why not you?
If you win the lottery, you have to pay income taxes on that money.
If you win in Vegas, you have to or “should” pay income taxes.
So if you receive free tuition, you should have to pay income taxes on that benefit.
Why not petition the university to consider the free tuition to be based on a merit scholarship?
Why not petition the university to pay you more for your “post-grad” status as a researcher.
If you are not doing research for the university but for your doctorate, then you should foot the cost of your education.  Why should I as an alumni, or even another student? Someone has to pay for the cost of your education.  Be an adult and be responsible for your own actions.  Life is a bitch.  So stop bitching about the ramifications of your decisions.  That’s called life.  We all make mistakes, but it’s how you handle the challenges that makes you grow up and become a contributor to society and not a self-professed, better than thou leach.
The US will continue to support advanced degree programs because eventually the university system will have to reduce the cost of tuition if the tax incentives go away for the attendees, and if the government stops subsidizing the tuition.  You might agree with me that the cost of attending university these days is so out of control that it precludes a lot of folks from being able to attend university. When I attended USC (1980-1982) the cost per credit was ~$85/unit, and by the time I graduated it was $125/unit.  My first job paid $17k per year and I still managed to pay off my college debt within 10 years…..  If you want to attend USC for your doctorate, you’ll find a way to pay the income tax.  You are a resourceful person, aren’t you?
Fight On.
Beat the Farm.
Decisions to go to grad school were made under different circumstances so that is a failed argument you’re trying to make.  You are also comparing your 40 year old degree to one in 2017 – where real wages have dropped absurdly over that time period. Do the wealthy need a tax cut? Do they not already have enough that was earned through the value created from the poor and middle classes? Should we really be making it more difficult for grad students to finish or even begin a degree? You are certainly misinformed and less enlightened that you think.
If I agreed with you we’d both be wrong.  Your opponent opinion is heard but you fail to understand Th fat it is not up to me or anyone to find your education.
If you want to use the reduction in the value of the dollar to find your education you can blame the federal sanctioned program of the government that reduces the purchasing power of the flat.  You and you shine are responsible for the cost of your education not the taxpayers nor the government.
So according to you, subsidizing education is bad but subsidizing a second yacht for millionaires is good. Everyone understands the simple logic behind GOP tax cuts, but history has shown that tax cuts for the wealthy doesn’t create more jobs. What’s easy to understand is that increasing access to education increases the wealth and prosperity of a country. Thousands of Phd students in engineering and science will never graduate and never create life-changing discoveries in an era where we need them the most. This is a moral failure for America and will lead to future economic disaster.
No one just prohibiting you from going after your educational goals. Just do it on your own. Grants, loans snd schollies will help. blaming the wealthy for their hard work and earned goodies is misguided.  Everybody should pay taxes and those who do should get tax breaks.  Those who don’t pay taxes don’t get tax breaks.

Student volunteers in USC’s Jumpstart chapter work closely with preschool children in the South Central Los Angeles area. Photo courtesy of Erin Croix.
AmeriCorps’ Jumpstart program is an educational initiative that works to connect underprivileged preschoolers with undergraduate students across the United States. Jumpstart’s USC chapter is going on its eighth year, helping children in the South Central Los Angeles community develop a strong base for their academic futures. 
Lamisa Hasan, a Jumpstart volunteer and junior studying human biology, said the program helped her find her place on campus. 
“One of my goals I set to myself for going to college outside of my hometown is that I want to get involved with the local community,” Hasan said. “For me, Jumpstart is the best of both worlds. Not only am I able to make an impact on the local community, but it’s also through a way that I love — working with little kids.”
Jumpstart connects with four different preschools in the area and around 150 children around the ages of 3 to 5 years old, according to Erin Croix, the USC program manager. 
“The preschool directors really decide whether they have room or if they’re interested in doing it,” Croix said. “They ultimately pick what it looks like when it’s implemented. Most of the time, though, it’s us reaching out and asking if [the program is] possible.”
Each year, Jumpstart recruits a minimum of 40 USC students to join, Croix said. 
“There are some [students] interested in working in education later in life — whether that be in the classroom or in advocacy or in policy,” Croix said. “We also see a lot of students who are interested in pediatrics or family law, so we really have undergraduates from everywhere. This speaks to our program and how wide our reach is. It attracts different students for different reasons.”
While the organization is intended to benefit the preschoolers, it also benefits USC and the surrounding area, Croix said. 
“[Jumpstart] builds a bridge between USC and the community outside,” Croix said. “There are a lot of ways USC students can easily be disconnected from the community just because of the format of campus and the new [USC] Village. Jumpstart is one of those programs that directly involves students.”
While this chapter of Jumpstart does have funding from its national AmeriCorps office, its program operating budget comes from USC’s Good Neighbors Grant, Croix said. The grant, which comes from faculty salary donations, is dispersed to various USC programs built to improve the surrounding community. 
Good Neighbors has been in place since 1994 and has given out nearly 700 grants in total, according to its website. 
“We are always at the involvement fairs and our applications for next semester open early spring,” Hasan said on getting involved with Jumpstart. “We also have a Facebook page and a website for contact.”

A screenshot from USC Annenberg professor Daniel Birman’s documentary Me Facing Life: Cyntoia’s Story, which focused on Cyntoia Brown, a 16-year-old arrested for murder in 2004. Photo courtesy of Daniel H. Birman Productions, Inc.
In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown was convicted of murdering a man who hired her for sex, an act she says she was forced into as a victim of sex trafficking. Brown, now 29, has served nearly 13 years of her life sentence in a Nashville prison — but in recent weeks, her story has entered the public consciousness as celebrities like Rihanna, Kim Kardashian West and Lana Del Rey shared their support online through the hashtag #FreeCyntoiaBrown. 
Daniel Birman, a documentarian  and professor at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, first brought Brown’s story to life through a 2011 documentary titled Me Facing Life: Cyntoia’s Story. At the time, he was inspired to focus on the juvenile experience in the justice system, without realizing its impact years later. 
“Back in 2002, I became interested, as a documentarian, in looking into how it is that juveniles can become violent,” Birman said. 
When reaching out to the Nashville Public Defender’s Office, Birman said it was very receptive to his interest in the correlation between juveniles and violence. 
In August 2004, Brown’s former attorney Kathy Evans called Birman and told him about Brown’s case. 
Having not yet acquired support from PBS Independent Lens, the studio that would eventually release the documentary, Birman agreed to interview Brown. Even though he was working alone at the time, Birman said he did not hesitate.
“I got off the phone, I called the airline, and I was on a flight that night, and the next morning I was in Nashville with a camera in my hand,” Birman said. “I started interviewing Cyntoia in the juvenile detention area.”
From that first interview, Birman said Brown came across as an incredibly bright and articulate woman, who was charged with a serious crime.  
“I’m looking through a viewfinder of a camera, and I’m looking at a kid [who] just days before had murdered a 44-year-old man who had picked her up for sex,” Birman said. “[That was ] when I really stopped to think about the fact that children are exposed to that kind of cruelty. It made me want to learn more.”
Birman admitted that his parents’ influence growing up, combined with his innate curiosity and stubbornness, all factored into the seven years he spent developing the documentary about Brown. 
“My mother was a huge proponent of social justice,” Birman said. 
He said she instilled in him ideas of justice and equality. On the other hand, his father worked as a scientist, analyzing complex ideas from different perspectives. When putting those two factors together, Birman believed it was inevitable that he would become a documentarian. 
At the very beginning of his journey, Birman took on all of the aspects necessary to develop the documentary — a large-scale project that lead him to return to Nashville frequently, spending entire evenings wide awake. 
“I’d be staring at the ceiling, wondering if I’m making the most expensive home movie I could ever imagine,” Birman said. 
He would pay for the airfare, the hotel, the car rentals; he also hired Annenberg students from USC to transcribe and examine the footage. 
So while Birman was funding his own project, he was also deciding how best to shape Brown’s story. 
“I wanted an audience to understand not only what happened to Cyntoia Brown as a kid but also to see what she was up against in a system,” Birman said. “If you see my documentary, you find out that Brown was at the tail end of three generations of violence against women.”
Birman said Brown’s grandmother was raped. Brown’s mother was also involved in drugs and prostitution before becoming a teen mother. By revealing the complexities of Brown’s history, Birman said he hoped to encourage audiences to think differently about juveniles in the criminal system.
“And thankfully the court system in Nashville was open to my telling this story,” Birman said. “What they had to trust is that, as a journalist, I would be fair. And I was, every step of the way.”
Funny how feminists ask us to sympathize with women who commit disturbing and violent crimes, while screaming for the resignation of someone like Senator Al Franken because he took a stupid funny picture.

The grant aims to fund the development of a full-scale four-year undergraduate track set to launch as early as Fall 2019, according to Market Insider. 
The Phase ONE Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to cancer clinical research, education and treatment programs as well as funding leaders in the scientific and medical community. 
With the foundation’s seed funding, the school will expand its interdisciplinary academic curriculum and co-curricular offerings in partnership with the Convergent Science Initiative in Cancer led by Peter Kuhn, a founding faculty member of  the Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“We are emboldened by Phase ONE’s commitment to education and innovative research,” Erica Muhl, founding executive director of Iovine and Young and dean of USC Roski School of Art and Design, told Markets Insider. “Their gift ensures we have the resources to continue to provide best-in-class education and develop innovative, agile thinkers who will help to shape the future of the health industries.” 
The health innovation track will allow undergraduate students to interact with teams of physicians, scientists, cancer patients, user experience and user interface designers and graduate students to develop health solutions to improve patient outcomes. 
In 2016, the pilot cancer module was created in collaboration with CSI-Cancer and Kuhn’s laboratory. Students from the academy worked with members in Kuhn’s lab as part of CSI-Cancer to develop CancerBase, an online platform that allows cancer patients to track real-time biometric data and measure the effectiveness of cancer treatment. 
“By blending the Academy’s human-centered design methodologies with biosciences, we can leverage the power of convergence to spark innovative approaches to the most intractable health problems,” Kuhn told Markets Insider.
Phase ONE Foundation Board Chair Royce Bergman said the collaboration between  Kuhn, the Academy and the Foundation has already yielded results for the future of cancer care. 
“The USC Iovine and Young Academy is clearly becoming a hotbed of ideas and innovation due to its collaborative and convergent framework,” Bergman told Markets Insider. “We are confident this new program will open new possibilities for future cancer researchers and transform patient experiences for generations to come.”

Peter Jesperson, the longtime manager of alternative rock band the Replacements, first discovered the band when the lead vocalist Paul Westerberg gave him a four-song demo tape. Photos courtesy of Alberto Nissim.
The Replacements, a band considered a pioneer of alternative rock, was formed in late 1979 in Minneapolis, Minn. The band’s classic lineup featured lead vocalist and guitarist Paul Westerberg; lead guitarist Bob Stinson; Stinson’s younger brother, bassist Tommy Stinson; and drummer Chris Mars. The band’s longtime manager Peter Jesperson discovered its members when Westerberg gave him a four-song demo tape. Jesperson signed the group to Twin Tone Records and served as the band’s manager until 1986, helping them grow from indie to the mainstream. 
The group was initially known as part of the punk scene in Minnesota, but Westerberg’s songwriting never truly fit that mold. He drew from a much larger palate, writing songs that drew as much on classic rock and country music as they did the punk rock of the day. This became evident in 1983’s Hootenanny, and earned the Replacements widespread critical acclaim on the band’s fourth album, Let It Be. The band built on this success with its major label debut Tim, which contained many of the band’s most famous compositions, including “Bastards of Young” and “Left of the Dial.” Westerberg’s songwriting drew much attention, and some hailed him as the voice of a generation. The band broke up in 1991 after the release of its final album All Shook Down. 
Currently, Jesperson resides in Los Angeles, where he is working to reboot Twin Tone Records. The Daily Trojan caught up with Jesperson for a conversation about his time as the Replacements’ manager and his role in its success. 
Daily Trojan: What made the Replacements different from any other band of the day?
Peter Jesperson: [The band] formed in late ’79, just as post-punk and new wave were getting popular and [it] didn’t sound like the other bands of the day to me. It was interesting to me, because at that time in Minneapolis I had a real bird’s eye view of the scene. A lot of people were playing as fast as they could and shouting slogans, and some of that I liked, and some of it I didn’t. But there was a lot of mediocre stuff crossing my desk. And when the Replacements came along, they sounded so different. They had a lot of elements – teenage angst, a punk-y style of playing and attitude and they just stuck out like a sore thumb. I was hearing so much stuff that sounded contemporary, that to hear them just took me back. I thought they sounded like a hopped-up version of Chuck Berry. 
DT: What was on that first demo that you heard?
PJ: There were four songs on it, two of which we put on the first album. The first song was called “Raised in the City,” the second one was called “Shape Up,” and then there was “Don’t Turn Me Down” and one called “Shutup.” They didn’t sound like anybody else. And they were just better than anything I’d heard. They weren’t afraid to sound like a traditional rock band. So many other bands were like “No more Elvis, no more Beatles, no more Stones” in 1977. I thought that was kind of a silly attitude. They just sounded so different and so good. I honestly thought someone was playing a joke on me. I thought, “These guys are signed to a major label, and somebody is pulling my leg.”
DT: The Replacements have several songs — “If Only You Were Lonely,” “You’re Getting Married,” “Within Your Reach,” “Skyway” — focused on love and relationships. Would you consider them a romantic band?
PJ: I don’t know if I’d consider them a romantic band, but I’d consider Paul a romantic guy who’s inclined to write romantic songs. It was a while before he could incorporate those into the band thing. When we were recording Hootenanny, I remember we tried to record “You’re Getting Married,” and I remember Bob at one point saying, “Save that for your solo album. That ain’t the Replacements, Paul.”  So it took a while to get there. And the dynamic was weird, because it was Bob’s band to begin with. Bob was really resistant to Paul becoming the frontman. And I know deep down Bob understood that Paul was what gave them the broader appeal. 
DT: What do you think Bob’s guitar playing added to the band?
PJ:  A lot of energy. And Bob’s influences weren’t traditional for a punk band. Most punk bands were self-taught and eschewed the Jeff Becks or the Jimmy Pages or the Eric Claptons and were trying to sound like the other punk bands of the day. But Bob loved The Beatles, and he loved Yes. Steve Howe was one of his favorite guitar players. One time I got Bob in to see Asia, the band that Steve Howe was in at one point, and got him backstage, and Bob was out of his mind. For him it was like meeting his hero. So Bob brought that rampant energy of punk, but he was also schooled on more traditional rock guitar players.
DT: As much as The Replacements had all these amazing original songs, a huge part of the band’s persona was all the covers it played. Why did they incorporate covers so frequently in their live shows and albums?
PJ: To me, all great bands start by playing covers. Generally speaking, people don’t form bands and have all original material. So they played covers to fill things out in the early days. The Beatles knew so many covers that they had enough material to play in Hamburg six nights a week, seven hours a night and not repeat songs. Doing covers and learning how a song works helps people write better songs of their own. At Twin Tone, some people were afraid that they’d be seen as a cover band, which I knew wouldn’t be the case. It was something that helped them write better songs and they were great songs for live sets. There’s a certain point where it tipped — where their own songs felt as strong as the covers. But in the early days, they’d play the covers and think they were better than their originals. And it helped the audience understand that these were people who listened to music and loved other people’s music.
DT: Changing gears a little, Tommy was 12 when he became a part of the band. How did he fare at such a young age and what was it like to watch him grow up?
PJ: The reason that Bob pulled Tommy into the group in the first place is that Tommy was getting in trouble, and he was trying to give him something more constructive to do. Tommy was 12 when we met. He certainly did childish things and acted like a kid sometimes, but a lot of the time he was just a musician. And he was such a good musician from the get-go that nobody ever questioned it. Watching him grow up was a funny experience. A lot of the time I felt the same way as you. I’d think, “Oh my God, are we ruining this person?” There was a point when bar owners would hassle us for him being under-aged. I had to go to a notary public and become his legal guardian for touring purposes. And up to a certain point he wouldn’t drink or be involved with any of the other substances we did. 
DT: What do you think it is about Paul’s songwriting that makes it so powerful?
PJ: He read a lot. He’s super smart. I think the word “genius” gets thrown around way too often, but he is definitely a genius, no question about it. He loved words, poetry and literature, and he loved rock and roll with an all-consuming passion. He grew up loving music and studying it. He listened to songs and took them apart and tried to figure out how he could do something as good. And in some cases he did better than a lot of stuff he grew up listening to.
DT: The Replacements were able to have those serious, heartfelt songs and also have some silly, hilarious songs. How do you think the band members’ sense of humor added to their music?
PJ: I think a sense of humor is essential to any rock band. Not having one is the downfall of many a rock band. Forgive me if you’re a U2 fan, but I find them overly earnest. I think they could use some funny songs and some humor. I even feel like Bruce Springsteen, who I admire to the nth degree, can be a little overly earnest as well. But The Beatles had a great sense of humor, The Rolling Stones had a great sense of humor. I think the greatest bands had that. The bands that are overly serious are hurt by that. It takes them down a notch or two or three. Having a sense of humor and not taking yourself too seriously is really important. Rock ‘n’ roll is largely ego-driven, and when that ego isn’t checked, bad music can happen.
DT: How have The Replacements influenced the rock scene today?
PJ: You still see bands emulating them. I imagine there are a lot of people who don’t know who they are, like kids who my son goes to school with. But Beach Slang, they’re very Replacements-esque. Wilco was super influenced by The Replacements. Jeff Tweedy once said, “We love The Replacements so much we want to be The Replacements.” And I think they will continue to be discovered and influence music. How many times have we heard that guitar music is out? It’s never out for good. These things go in cycles.
DT: How would you summarize the primary message The Replacements wanted to communicate through their music? 
PJ: Be yourself. I’ve always said I don’t understand it when people talk about guilty pleasures. If I like something, I like it. I don’t have a guilty pleasure. Some people will confess to secretly loving bubblegum music. Sh-t, there’s a lot of great bubblegum music, why wouldn’t you like it? The Replacements invited people to be themselves and not worry about it. If this is the way you are, just give it all you’ve got.

Brandon Douglas, a sophomore majoring in creative writing, is heavily involved in the student-artist community. Photo courtesy of Brandon Douglas.
Through an EP replete with catchy rap choruses, saxophone solos and funky guitar riffs, Brandon Douglas has developed a distinctive hip-hop and neo-soul sound as well as an original and trendy aesthetic. Douglas, better known as Bran Movay, is a sophomore majoring in creative writing  who has cultivated a strong presence in the student-artist community despite not pursuing an education in music. On Friday, Douglas will play a local show at the Yoni House with fellow USC musicians Zembased and Martin Ladell.
Over the summer, Douglas marked his debut in the music industry through the release of  “Flower Talk,” an entirely self-produced five-track EP. Douglas’ childhood growing up in Dallas has often inspired his songwriting. Douglas’ musical talent and experience  in graphic design and videography has granted  him full creative freedom to carry out his artistic vision. A melange of rap, neo-soul and jazz, Douglas’ musical style embodies his aptitude for melding hip-hop with personal influences. 
The Daily Trojan sat down with Douglas to learn more about his development as an artist as well as his upcoming plans.
Daily Trojan: Your childhood has been a major inspiration in your music. How did growing up in Dallas impact your musical style?
Brandon Douglas: I’d say being from Dallas didn’t have any specific impact on my music, rather growing up in the school system I went to, a really small private school, definitely allowed me to try a lot of different things that I wouldn’t have at a big public school. I definitely would’ve been too scared to do anything at a bigger school … so it enabled me to experiment and not be too afraid to try something new.
DT: How did the local scene play a role in your growth as an artist?
BD: I’m still exploring the local scene in terms of the bigger picture of Dallas, like all of the music that is coming out of there. I’d say my friends are more involved in it than I am; they know other rising hip-hop artists who are on the scene in Dallas, as well as the whole community there. We’ve played a couple of clubs there whenever we [were] back together, so it’s always fun to be involved in the scene.
DT: Growing up, you maintained a relationship with music producers Erykah Badu and André 3000. What was some of the best advice they gave you in terms of being an artist in the music industry?
BD: Keep going. I remember André said those exact words: “Just keep at it.” Even if you do have some sort of talent or something is there, you’ll never know for sure until you explore your style and who you are as an artist, which comes with time.
DT: How did you get your start in music?
BD: My friend and I would always love playing around in GarageBand, so that’s definitely where it started. I didn’t get serious about until my sophomore year of high school. My friend bought this really nice recording mic and we just ended up making a project together. All throughout school, I was getting better at producing, rapping and all of that. Last year was the first time I released something on my own without my friends backing me up.
DT: When did you realize that you wanted to pursue a music career?
BD: I’m still kind of realizing it now. It’s a weird thing because I feel like there’s more to me than music, but music can definitely take me to a place where I’d be able to explore everything else that I want to do. So I’d say I am pursuing music but it’s definitely not just music. I don’t know, it’s just something that I’ve happened to get good at and other people seem to like it so I’m going to keep doing it.
DT: How would you describe your musical style to someone who has never listened to your work?
BD: I usually tell people it’s a mix of neo-soul, hip-hop and a little bit of jazz thrown in there. I have a lot of friends who are instrumentalists so I like to get a few saxophone and guitar solos. It’s definitely grounded in hip-hop since I’m rapping most of the time and also singing a lot.
DT: Describe your creative process.
BD:  Most of the time it starts with a voice memo. I’ll take a voice memo of anything; it could be a melody, a flow, an idea for a hook or a chord. Then I’ll either start making the beat or start writing the song. Most of the time I start with the beat and then write over the beat that I produced, but a few songs on the EP started with the lyrics and I made the beat around the lyrics, which is a lot harder to do in my opinion.
DT: What is the biggest thing you have learned from releasing “Flower Talk”?
BD: I learned that I definitely don’t want to be mixing and mastering my music anymore. I like producing the beats and everything, but mixing and mastering seem like busy work. So I definitely want to move on from that and I’ve found a couple of people who might mix for me. I’m also just happy to have something out with my name on it. I learned that it was an adventure. Nothing ended the way I thought it would, but it turned out pretty cool.
DT: Who are your style influencers?  
BD: Fashion-wise I’d say I look up to people like Tyler, the Creator and Luka Sabba — they’re both really cool. My dad is probably my biggest style influence because I borrow a lot of his clothes sometimes and he just has a great sense of style.
DT: What is your dream collaboration?
BD: Pharrell, Childish Gambino, Tyler, the Creator or Smino would be cool.
DT: It’s been about six months since “Flower Talk” was released. Are you working on any new music?
BD: Yes, there is always something going on. I’m hopefully going to come out with a song “Mama” with my friend Ahmed. It’s kind of a collaborative track, so it’s both of our songs and it’ll be a single dropped later in December or January. We’re wrapping it up now, so we’ll see because it might lead to a full-length project with him.
DT: Can you tell us about any plans you have for 2018?
BD: I’m hoping to get a website up at least by the summer. I’m also working on a few music videos. One of the songs off of “Flower Talk,” “Willie Mayes,” is the furthest along. I’m working with a friend named Lindsay who is a junior [studying] film at UCLA and she will be directing it. We will hopefully be shooting all that in January or February next year. I’ve been performing a whole lot, so I’m looking forward to more of that next year.
DT: Do you have any advice for those who want to get a start in the music industry?
BD: Don’t be afraid to start somewhere — everyone has to start somewhere. Find people with similar tastes or even people [who] don’t have similar tastes. Collaborate, collaborate, collaborate!

The Chronicles of LA will take place at an undisclosed vintage hotel located in Downtown. Photo courtesy of The Confluence.
In an experiential art exhibit and pop-up store set against the backdrop of an undisclosed vintage hotel, Angelenos will be able to experience fashion, art, performance and music under one roof. From Friday to Saturday, The Chronicles of LA, self-branded as “a weekend of immersive storytelling retail,” will bring together more than 60 different artists from across the globe to showcase their notions of sex through a variety of media.
Over the course of the two-day event, guests will have the opportunity to purchase art, clothing and products from participating artists and also witness surprise performances by dancers, performers and musicians. The immersive experience was conceptualized by multimedia artist James Mountford and fashion expert Leena Similu. 
“We wanted to create a space that would be inspiring and experiential but also a place to shop for exciting new items,” Mountford said. 
The two, who are based in London, chose Los Angeles as the destination for their next venture because of its vibrant art and fashion scene. 
“When we moved to Los Angeles from London, we found a huge community of locally grown talent that was so raw and energetic and full of life,” Mountford said. “We felt it was the ideal place to initiate a project that can spotlight and nurture these young, diverse and unique talents.” 
To ensure that every guest has an individualized experience based on when they arrive and how long they stay, exhibits and performances will be unannounced and scattered throughout the venue. The event will take place in Downtown Los Angeles but its exact location has not yet been announced, beyond the fact that it will be hosted in a vintage hotel. 
“We wanted a venue that was completely out of the norm for a pop-up store,” Similu said. “Something that would ignite curiosity and intrigue, and hotels always have a very sexual undertone to them so it seemed perfect.” 
Mountford and Similu conducted extensive research to identify and assemble their team of participating artists. Their backgrounds vary from classically trained artists to self-taught fashion designers. Notable and diverse attendees will include abstract BDSM painter Ali Silverstein; dancer and choreographer Jessica Emmanuel; ballpoint pen artist Cary Kwok; designer duo Namilia; and the creators of luxury fashion brand Ammunition Couture. 
“Once we found a core group of artists, it grew organically through word-of-mouth and introductions,” Mountford said. “We were very fortunate in the sense that everybody we met was so open and enthusiastic about the idea.” 
The event will also see big name performers who are performing “secret gigs” so that they can experiment and be creative with their media without the pressure of pleasing fans. At night, a dominatrix, who doubles as a Ph.D. student by day, will gently electrocute willing volunteers to raise money in support of the transgender community. 
By focusing the exhibits, performances and storefronts on sex, Mountford and Similu hope to encourage an open discussion surrounding the topic. 
“We hope the event will open a discourse about sex in all its guises,” Similu said. “We’ve pushed hard to try and represent all aspects and most [artists] have really surprised us with the depth of their thought process.” 
The roster also comprises 70 percent female artists, which the event organizers hope will ensure that the portrayals of human sexuality are appropriate, respectful and interesting to all patrons. 
This debut installment — called Chapter I: Sex — will be the first part of The Chronicles of LA series. Forthcoming chapters will be based on new themes and take place in different secret locations throughout the city. 
Those interested in attending are encouraged to RSVP online, where they will receive more information and a formal invitation to the secret venue.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
Earlier this week, I was thrilled to publish a letter to the editor from UCLA’s undergraduate student government president about female leadership and the representation of women. It’s a topic that’s not only close to my heart, but also of profound relevance as report after report surfaces of men in positions of power — in Hollywood, on Capitol Hill, everywhere — abusing their power to sexually exploit those who lack the resources to fight back. 
Many have responded to the unveiling of this systemic issue by rising in solidarity, bravely sharing their stories and demanding accountability. But others, like Republican Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, have suggested that the solution to this issue might be to hire fewer women — as if women should be punished for the inexcusable behavior of men, and, as if hiring more people who are less likely to sexually harass their peers and subordinates — women — would hurt rather than help the situation. 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has argued, while responding to a journalist’s question about the handfuls of allegations against President Donald Trump, that accusations of sexual misconduct should not even be investigated unless the accused man admits to his misdeeds. Sanders has a long history of saying dangerous things to defend her boss, but without doubt, this — a blanket shield for sexual predators to hide behind across the country — was her most dangerous yet. Her words discredit and directly attack all women who are survivors of abuse, and tell the many women who experience harassment and abuse every day that they must suffer in silence because their words will never be believed over those of their powerful male abusers.
As I write my last column of the semester, it seems we’ve reached a crossroads. Women and survivors of sexual abuse across the country have finally managed to prove that a systemic issue we’ve faced since the dawn of time actually exists. Proving this was far from easy. Many who have never experienced sexism firsthand are skeptics of its continued existence, and the cultural awareness that we’re seeing now marks a crucial step in the right direction. But the aforementioned responses to these revelations make it painfully clear how much work still remains to be done. 
The issue of limitations on female authority in this country pervades everything — gender gaps in Hollywood and Congress, laws that deny women basic decision-making authority over their own bodies and, more than anything, the widespread notion that masculinity rather than femininity equates to strength and effective leadership. Why is industry sexual abuse so prevalent? Because of male dominance in leadership across every industry. And why do men dominate leadership roles across every industry? For far too long, we as a society have accepted the lie that there are simply fewer qualified, ambitious women than there are qualified, ambitious men as an acceptable answer. 
But then came Nov. 8, 2016.
For the many who have tried to repress the events of that date from their memories, Nov. 8, 2016 was the day we elected Donald Trump: a man with over a dozen accusations of sexual abuse toward women and zero public service experience, over the most qualified — and first female — candidate in our nation’s history. After that, how could we ever again delude ourselves into believing that gender gaps in leadership roles are not, at least in some measure, the product of disdain for female authority? 
A few months after the election, I had the honor of becoming the Daily Trojan’s editorial director, succeeding a long line of brilliant, ambitious and fearless female editorial directors. For most of my life, I’d internalized my identity as a follower. Only through observing the graceful leadership and receiving the guidance and support of Danni Wang and Sonali Seth, both editorial directors before me, did I finally begin to see myself as more than just a girl who loved to write, but as a leader. 
Of course, it wasn’t just them. Through the weekly “Playing Politics” column authored by Lily Vaughan, the editorial director before me, I’ve learned the importance and power of outspokenness from young women. And this semester, from watching the leadership of our editor-in-chief Emma Peplow, I’ve become convinced that no challenge — nor any rapid succession of challenges — is too much for a determined woman driven by the desire to serve something she believes in. 
What I’ve learned from all of this is that powerful women deserving of all the opportunities in the world, qualified and equipped with all the requisite skills to be brilliant leaders, aren’t just the icons we see on TV screens or read about in news articles. Powerful women are everywhere because, simply put, it takes power just to be a woman in a society ruled by men. That’s something I’ve always believed in, and working as the editorial director of the Daily Trojan for this past year has only reinforced that belief. 
Kylie Cheung is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Her column,“You Do Uterus,” ran  Thursdays.
“…succeeding a long line of brilliant, ambitious and fearless female editorial directors.” HAHAHAHA. Loser.

Today marks our last issue, and with it, our last editorial board in what has proven to be a historic semester at USC. At the beginning of the Fall 2017 semester, our first editorial board called on the University to be proactive rather than reactive in preventing corruption and responding to scandals. Since then, we as journalists at the Daily Trojan have done our utmost to hold the University accountable amid an ongoing cycle of breaking news.
In many ways, news on campus this semester has mirrored the climate of the nation as a whole. A seemingly relentless string of controversies has rocked the University, from the revelations over the summer about former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito’s drug use and involvement with criminals to the most recent allegations about School of Social Work professor Erick Guerrero’s alleged sexual misconduct. In between, there was an FBI investigation that led to the indictment of assistant basketball coach Tony Bland on charges of corruption and bribery; the resignation of Keck Dean Rohit Varma following a Los Angeles Times story about a sexual harassment case from 2003; and a false alarm of an active shooter that locked down the entire campus in October. 
All of this has taken place amid a backdrop of social and political turmoil across the country, from Congress’ efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act to fears about nuclear war with North Korea. And much like the rest of the country, the USC community is exhausted. The news cycle can seem unrelenting at times, and it’s easy to fall into the trap of apathy — not caring about a particular issue, or letting one fall through the cracks, because it’s clear that another one will soon arise to take its place. 
As USC’s oldest news source, we cannot — and will not — allow ourselves to succumb to that desire. Since 1912, we have provided the student body, staff, faculty and other community members with information about events, issues and people on and off campus, and now more than ever, it’s crucial for us to continue our role in keeping the administration and student organizations accountable and to ensure that the stories our community must be aware of are not brushed off and forgotten. Through our reporting, the onus is on us to not take anything at face value, to include information from all sides of an issue and to cover campus in a way that represents all of its diverse facets. 
With every breaking news event and scandal that has taken place at USC this semester, our reporters have been on the frontlines, speaking with all of the possible stakeholders in every news story,  from University administrators to faculty accused of wrongdoing. In turn, the Daily Trojan’s editorial section has shared diverse voices and perspectives based on the findings of our reporting, and fostered an overarching dialogue geared at producing solutions, transparency and accountability. Our special issues have critically examined USC as an institution and a growing powerhouse, and shared voices about what the University can and must do to become a force for positive change.
However, that is not to say that we’re perfect. Like all media organizations, we occasionally make mistakes, and when they are brought to our attention we take steps to correct them. But our goal is always to provide fair, accurate reporting, and we value any feedback that we receive. Ultimately, while our goal is to ensure accountability at the levels of students, faculty and administrators, it is our readers who in turn keep us accountable — and we want to continue to build that relationship of mutual trust in semesters to come. 
It is both a difficult and exciting time to cover news at USC, and at a time when trust in media and institutions is at an all-time low, we vow to continue this semester’s pledge to earn our readership’s trust: with every issue, every day. 
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
I wonder if the next group of easily offended DT women writers will be has constantly hungry as this group.  Seems that half of the stories were about food and getting more at all hours for free.  
God Bless Ladies!
Neat to see another morally bankrupt organization patting itself on the back for continuing to trundle onward with what little momentum has been left over from the more talented inhabitants of USC journalism’s brighter past. With a student body that wouldn’t trust you to copy-edit their freshman essays, a faculty that spews pleasantries through your all-too-willing pens in the face of genuine scandal, and the broader cultural relevance of my roommates’ nascent post-grunge metal band, your continued existence, much less credibility, seems suspect at best to this observer.

Earlier this week, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced its plan to launch the Inclusion Initiative under the leadership of journalism professor Stacy Smith. The goal of the project is to promote diversity in a broader range of industries; while the Media, Diversity, and Social Change Initiative focused on film, this project will involve both the film and music industries. The project was heralded by Annenberg Dean Willow Bay as “a true force for industry change.” 
Smith’s Inclusion Initiative is necessary because the entertainment industry is a crucial channel through which people — especially young people — absorb information and develop their understanding of society and identity. For example, American teenagers consume an average of nine hours of entertainment media per day. The influence that entertainment media wields over this rising generation cannot be understated. Subsequently, the industry has the ability to shape young people’s values and perspectives to be welcoming of diversity, inclusion and their greater roles in society. 
In other words, when underrepresented groups are not given the same opportunities in media, a non-inclusive culture is dangerously normalized. If characters, actors and artists of varying minority groups are not given the same kinds of careers, hobbies and relationships in entertainment media as majority groups, we are more likely to see this passively accepted in the real world. A prime example of underrepresentation in a certain is the lack of minorities and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. 
The Media, Diversity, and Social Change Initiative at Annenberg recently held a panel called “Cracking the Code” earlier this month and discussed a project the think tank has been working on with Google. The project aims to represent more women and minorities in the field of computer science on television shows by replacing the stereotype of the straight, white male computer scientist with an equally competent scientist who represents one or more underrepresented groups.
This diversity and representation could mark a key step toward changing the demographics at institutions like USC. While the Viterbi School of Engineering saw its highest number of female students yet at 44 percent last year, there is still work to be done to improve the skewed gender ratios in faculty. Only one third of faculty in Viterbi are female, and the diversity of both students and faculty in terms of ethnicity and sexual identity and orientation. However, the University is taking necessary steps to remedy the cultural biases that shape these demographics. As seen in the Media, Diversity, and Social Change Initiative’s work with Google, USC recognizes that a crucial component in changing dated norms is changing our media.
Through their various projects and initiatives, Annenberg and Smith are actively addressing USC’s desire to increase diversity in other fields as well. Another important part of the new Inclusion Initiative Think Tank addresses storytelling and discourse within the music industry. As Bay explained in a statement, “The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative is a leader in addressing inequality in entertainment and by expanding their work to include examinations of mental health in storytelling and inequality in all aspects of the music industry.” 
Not only are groups represented through visual portrayals, but they are also represented through spoken word, audio media and, of course, the everyday dialogue unfolding around us. Outside of the music industry, the inclusion of all groups in the conversations at USC is crucial for creating more opportunities for and recognizing the different needs and experiences of everyone. 
While it is difficult to determine the solution to promoting diversity in each field, changing what we see in the media industry marks a crucial starting point. What we see and hear in the media shapes what we believe is normal. It’s what shows young boys and girls their potential. It plays a decisive role in shaping their futures. Representation in both media and popular discourse is the key to increasing diversity at USC.

A USC student-run media outlet will soon be accessible on Snapchat, thanks to a partnership between the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the social media company. 
Earlier this year, Snap, Inc. began reaching out to several college campuses across the country, asking them to create weekly local campus editions for Snapchat’s Discover section.
Upon learning about this initiative, Annenberg associate professor Amara Aguilar worked with Snapchat to help expand Dímelo, a subset of Annenberg Media that creates Latinx and bilingual content, to reach wider audiences using the app. 
Aguilar co-teaches a journalism course called “Social Media Storytelling for Diverse Audiences” with professor Laura Castañeda, which focuses on multicultural journalism. Students in the class produce content for Dímelo, which will be posted on Snapchat weekly starting Friday. 
“I think we’re the only Latino campus media brand featured in this program right now, so that’s really exciting for us,” Aguilar said. “I think what’s really important is that students are creating the types of stories that they also consume and engage with, and this is a great opportunity for our Latino brand to have exposure and more engagement with our local audience.”
Since its inception in Fall 2016, Dímelo content has been shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Medium and Instagram. With this new partnership with Snapchat, editor Claudia Buccio, a graduate student studying journalism, has been working with Dímelo staff members to adapt to the app by creating shorter versions of what they typically post on other platforms. 
“It’s been learning to choose snippets of a story that would be appealing to viewers so that they can tap on their screens and watch the whole thing, but at the same time it is also shareable on Facebook or on Instagram,” Buccio said. “It’s been fun because this is a whole new platform we are learning about.”

According to Buccio, Dímelo’s Latinx and bilingual content greatly appealed to Snapchat. Through weekly editions featured in USC’s geographic area, the Dímelo staff hopes to introduce its audience to Latinx culture, as well as the ins and outs of what it is like to be Latinx in the United States. 
Additionally, Buccio hopes to help the audience feel included in the Dímelo community by producing both English and Spanish content.
“We are in Los Angeles, so it’s important to use both languages in a way that we are comfortable with it,” Buccio said. “Just having the opportunity of using a platform to voice that and also make it available to other students … It’s a way of bringing cultural awareness to our community, which at many times isn’t really represented on platforms, so Dímelo makes sure that that is not the case.”
In the future, Dímelo looks to further expand its social media presence by launching a Spanish-language broadcast for Facebook, as well as experimenting with virtual reality projects. Additionally, the students hope to continue their partnership with Snapchat beyond next semester. 
“[Working with Snapchat] is already an amazing way of getting our voice into the conversation,” Buccio said. “It is a great opportunity for our students, regardless of their interests in media or entertainment or news, [because] there’s a different way of telling stories, and I feel like the platform is friendly for any of those options.” 
Editor’s note: Daily Trojan news editor Tomás Mier also serves as the managing editor of Dímelo.

Students will soon have access to free testing materials and hygiene products thanks to an Undergraduate Student Government initiative. 
USG plans to provide free “blue books” and Scantron forms used in exams beginning next week, and free menstrual products may be available as soon as next semester, according to USG President Austin Dunn. The USG Facebook page will be updated with the pickup locations for blue books and Scantron forms on campus once they are confirmed.
Marina Hrovat, director of wellness affairs for USG, has spearheaded the effort to implement free menstrual products on campus. She worked with USG to conduct a trial run of free menstrual products to gauge the idea’s popularity.
A USG poll taken during the trial run found that 99 percent of student respondents believed that free menstrual products are necessary.
Dunn explained that while products like Scantron forms and blue books may be affordable — most cost less than $1 at the USC Bookstore — they pose an inconvenience to students if they are not provided by the school.
“There was no reason, whatsoever, that students should have needed to pay for a school supply that is required for exams,” Dunn said.
While providing free blue books and Scantron forms is imminent, the same cannot be said for menstrual products. Dunn is aiming for implementation of these products in the coming months, but said the process is not entirely under USG’s control.
“The goal [for free menstrual product availability] is next semester,” Dunn said. “I cannot put a hard deadline or prediction on when this will be completed because we do rely on outside companies to make these products free. We need to figure out if this is going to be a sponsorship or partnership with an outside company or if they will be provided by the University.”
Dunn stressed his administration’s belief in keeping costs outside of tuition at a minimum, and that this was the primary motivation behind these measures. 
“College affordability and tuition transparency, those issues being an overarching topic, are things that [USG Vice President] Morgan [Monahan] and I have talked about from the beginning,” Dunn said. “We recognize how much of a burden finances can be at this University and we are just trying to meet that need in the best way that we can.”

Graduate students at USC pose with posters explaining why they oppose a proposed tax change that would cause students to be taxed for tuition exemptions. Photo courtesy of Grad Tax Walkout website.
Five USC graduate students have organized a national walkout on Wednesday to protest provisions that would affect higher education in the Republican-sponsored tax reform bill. 
Over 50 campuses across 32 states have registered to walk in the Grad Tax Walkout at the time of publication, including Columbia University, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley.
The provisions in the House of Representatives’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are not included in a separate tax Senate tax bill, would count graduate and professional students’ waived tuition as income, allowing it to be taxed. Currently, many graduate students receive free tuition as part of their program, along with stipends they receive for serving as teaching assistants. If the current tax reform bill passes the Senate, both bills will go to conference, where provisions will be negotiated for the final bill. 
“The [provisions] would make it prohibitively more expensive for people to get into higher education, even more so than it is now,” said Hannah Khoddam, a national organizer of the walkout. “I think a lot of people don’t really know what graduate students do, especially as it relates to other parts of society … For this movement, we wanted to draw attention to what graduate students offer beyond sitting in a room and taking classes.”
The bill would affect their professional training,” Khoddam said.  “Graduate students, work in labs, teach undergraduate students and provide external care in various medical centers.”
Khoddam and her fellow organizers, Nina Jhaveri, Marie Gillespie, Hannah Rasmussen and Miriam Rubenson, are all clinical psychology students pursuing a doctorate degree. 
The five discussed the possibility of movement after a faculty clinical science meeting on Nov. 15, where concerns about the tax bill were raised. The idea evolved into a national walkout event, after they connected with experienced organizers from March for Science and Save Grad Ed, a group of six universities across the East Coast and Midwest region, according to Jhaveri. 
“There are a vast number of students across a vast number of universities who are against this tax bill,” Jhaveri said. “Graduate students are the bedrock of innovation, of research, of technology, of the economy. And if [the tax bill affects] graduate students and future researchers in this manner, it’s threatening the very economy of the country.” 
In addition to taxing tuition waivers, the bill also targets $5,250 of tax-free income faculty, undergraduates and graduate students receive. Students’ loan interest deduction is also at risk for repeal. 
Although mainly graduate students have been vocal against the bill, it still holds implications for undergraduate students, according to David Schwartz, an associate professor of psychology. 
“It’s not just graduate tuition that’s going to be taxed, but it’s also going to be interest on student loans,” Schwartz said. “So, an undergraduate [student] to get out of the University of Southern California with loans will now be paying tax on the interest.”
Rubenson, the local organizer of the walkout, hopes undergraduate students and staff will participate alongside graduate students. 
“We want to call our senators, in California and for people who are out of state, call their home state senators, [to] get them to vote no on this tax bill,” Rubenson said. 
In addition to the walkout, students will also be phone banking to key legislators. 
“This isn’t a walkout to protest our administration, it’s a protest with our administration against this tax reform bill,” Gillespie said.
Both Rubenson and Gillespie expressed their gratitude for the support of the clinical psychology department and the USC administration. Despite University provisions that require student protests to be registered five weeks in advance, Rubenson said USC has supported their right to demonstrate.
The Office of the Provost has previously issued a letter stating its support for graduate students and emphasizing USC’s advocacy efforts as Congress debates tax reform.
“We are working in Washington, D.C. every day — along with other higher ed organizations — urging lawmakers to support our hard-working graduate students, staff, and families,” USC Provost Michael Quick said, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We unequivocally back continued investment in American education as a highly-educated and highly-skilled workforce is critical for a better future for our country and for the world. Regardless of the outcome of this process, we will continue to support students and staff from all backgrounds and work to make educational opportunity as accessible as possible.”

Students who participate in Innovation Corps gain skills to market businesses. Photo courtesy of Viterbi News.
Kickstarting a company can be a difficult feat for some students while balancing school and other activities. Seventy-five percent of venture-backed startups fail, according to a Harvard Business Review study. 
But at USC, the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps, or I-Corps program, teaches the skills Viterbi School of Engineering students need to learn how to market their products and grow a start-up.
USC was recently renewed as an anchor institution of I-Corps, meaning more students may have the opportunity to take part in this program.
“The I-Corps program is really focused on getting academics to translate their research over to industry or to profitable business so that it can be marketable to the public,” said Jasmine Berry, a doctoral computer science student participating in the I-Corps program. “One of the main goals of I-Corps is to teach students business skills that they would not otherwise get working in a lab.”
Founded by the National Science Foundation, the I-Corps program teaches students entrepreneurial skills to help them connect their research projects to the real world. 
Participants are given $50,000 to grow their project and seven weeks during which they must talk to 100 potential customers to learn how to fit their technology to the public’s needs. 
Translating research into solutions for real-world problems is one challenge that many students struggle with, said Zumra Peksaglam, a doctoral student studying chemical engineering who will be participating in the I-Corps program in January in Atlanta. 
I-Corps looks to alleviate this issue by having students to participate in conversations with potential customers to get feedback on how their product could be changed to better fit the public’s needs. 
“You are talking about their needs,” Peksaglam said. “If they don’t need it, they are not going to buy it.”
Participation in I-Corps connects students to established companies that can offer them feedback and advice.
“Through the program, I was surrounded by a valuable network of founders,” said Niki Bayat, a doctoral I-Corps participant studying chemical engineering. “The unique environment of the program helped me to accelerate our business.”
To participate in I-Corps, students must first have an idea for a product. They then form a team that consists of a technical lead, an entrepreneurial lead and an I-Corps mentor. 
Ted Lee, an associate professor of chemical engineering and material science, has worked as the technical lead part of an I-Corps team and has seen I-Corps grow over the years at USC.
“There’s the direct benefit of … learning the business world, which as an engineering graduate students, we don’t get a lot of,” Lee said. 
Lee said the skills and connections that students develop in I-Corps can assist them in their ventures once they leave school. 
Ross Mead graduated from USC in 2015 and founded his start-up, Semio, a month later. Mead said he now regularly gets investment inquiries and is looking to grow his company.
“A lot of it is thanks to the I-Corps program, which instilled in me a very formal framework for talking to customers and understanding the market,” Mead said. “[I-Corps] completely changed my perspective. I’m a hardcore researcher who now thinks more like an entrepreneur.” 
Recently, the National Science Foundation renewed USC’s status as an anchor institution for its I-Corps activities in Southern California. USC will act as a node for the I-Corps program, working to build a network in the region to foster innovation. 
“USC has a history of recognizing the importance of entrepreneurship,” Lee said. “From that perspective, I think USC seems like a natural place to serve as a node.”

Two days before USC’s football team defeated UCLA at the Coliseum, graduate students from two USC schools beat their crosstown counterparts in another field — real estate planning.
On Nov. 16, the USC Marshall School of Business and Price School of Public Policy took home the coveted Silver Shovel prize at the NAIOP SoCal USC vs. UCLA Real Estate Challenge. 
For the past 20 years, the challenge has showcased graduate student teams of five from the Ziman Center of Real Estate at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management and the Lusk Center for Real Estate at Marshall and Price schools. The teams go head-to-head to create the best use for a specified land site. 
This year,  master of real estate development students Cutter MacLeod, Lindsey Mills, Christopher Kovel, Leah Mogabgab and Walker Wood developed the winning proposal for Sky Studios. They proposed transforming the site in question — eight acres of land at the corner of Maple Avenue and Douglas Street in El Segundo, Calif. — into a state-of-the-art content and media campus for companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. 
“We took a step back and thought about what industries were driving the economy, and it was always the entertainment industry in Los Angeles, [so] we kind of wanted to jump onto that wave,” MacLeod said. “We wanted to put forth a proposal that was exciting and transformative for El Segundo, and one that the actual developer would be inclined to build.”
Prior to the competition, each team member was required to go through an audition process conducted by the master in real estate development program director. Since there was a variety of roles required for the competition, each member had a specialized background in areas like architecture, finance or brokerage, which ultimately helped the members strengthen their ideas for the land site.
“It’s cool because we all come into the [MRED] program with different backgrounds,” Mills said. “We of course learn from each other in the program, but in the competition, it’s all of those skillsets put together, and you really have to work together.”
Immediately after the team was finalized, the next six weeks consisted of pulling all-nighters and working on the project non-stop. According to MacLeod, a week and a half into the competition, the students had the basic points of their idea already nailed down, but after a few meetings with several developers, who suggested other ideas, they started to doubt their plan.
“We spent the next two days spinning our wheels and arguing with each other,” MacLeod said. “That sucked because it set us back, but in the end, it was positive because once we decided to go back to our original plan, we had some alternatives mapped out and really thought them through [and realized that] we wouldn’t and shouldn’t be doing anything else. That was tough, but it was necessary.”
Despite these early setbacks in the competition, the team members said they succeeded in determining the best use for the El Segundo site.
“It was amazing, and we were kind of in shock for the first 20 minutes,” MacLeod said. “The coolest part was when the developer himself told us that it was one of the best proposals he had ever seen, and he was taking photos of the whole thing. We felt like we put together a really good proposal, something that we were really proud of.”
Can creating proposals like the one created here lead to good opportunities to work with Land Developers?

On Tuesday, Dornsife Dialogues hosted a panel discussion on the potential of a nuclear war with North Korea. Led by USC Dornsife Dean Amber Miller, the panel included David Petraeus, a retired U.S. Army four-star general, and David Kang, a professor of international relations and the director of the USC Korean Studies Institute. At the event, the panelists discussed the political and economic issues between North Korea and the rest of the world.
With intensifying political tension with North Korea from the Trump administration, the possibility of a nuclear war hangs in the minds of American citizens. According to a Pew Research study, 65 percent of Americans are concerned about North Korea’s nuclear weapons. 
Both Petraeus and Kang focused on the perceptions and their opinions on North Korea leader Kim Jong-un and how his leadership affects international politics, specifically the relationship between North Korea and the United States. 
“I actually think [the Asia] trip is really important,” Kang said. “President [Donald] Trump, particularly on the Japan and Korea side where he was talking about North Korea, he hit all the right notes. In general, the message I hear from President Trump, even though it’s a little more flamboyant than perhaps others, remains a deterring message.” 
Kang explained how Trump’s recent visit to South Korea and Japan was a crucial step toward the relationship and future interactions between East Asia and the United States. 
Both Kang and Petraeus also assessed the security dilemma between the two countries and how the United States is trying to get a stronger stance against North Korea.
“To put this into context in United States terms, I think you need to be fair with the current administration and acknowledge that it faces a different prospect from any of its predecessors and other administrations,” Petraeus said. “I think it’s understandable that there should be such a focus on this [nuclear attack] issue with the U.S. National Security Team.” 
Because North Korea has the ability and resources to strike the United States, Petraeus believes that China must play a more prominent role in communications between the countries, because the current message discipline is lacking. Petraeus also emphasized that the sooner China realizes these strategic gratifications, the better this situation will be for all parties. 
Kang observed that the United States is more worried about a nuclear attack from North Korea than the rise of the Chinese economy, and he found it interesting how the United States fears a smaller country more than a great power. 
“I think it’s interesting that we’ve been worried about the rise of China, but the rise of China hasn’t caused a lot of military response in the region,” Kang said. “But the smallest country, North Korea, is getting South Korea to rethink their military commitment. I think it’s very interesting that it’s not the biggest country that’s causing the instability, it’s the smallest country and I think that’s something we need to think about and starting understanding.” 
Kang explained how North Korea has consistently made deterring statements in past years, such as “If you strike us first, we will strike you back.” However, one of the reasons a fear of attack in the United States is growing is because most of the media only reports on the second portion of the statement, to create a “sea of fire” image to the audience, he said. 
Petraeus and Kang ended the forum by conversing about how the decisions China makes in regards to joining sides with the United States or North Korea will severely impact the future of international politics. Trump has threatened multiple times to stop U.S. trade with China.
“If the trade sanctions are actually enforced by China, it would be a big deal,” Petraeus said. “China could literally turn the lights out in Pyongyang if it wants to. It will not, probably because it wants to try to calibrate this to bring Kim Jong-un to his senses instead of his knees. They don’t want North Korea to collapse.”

Andy Enfield remembers his free throw shooting percentage in college, down to the tenth of a percent.
Of course, it’s hard to forget if it was an NCAA record. For 17 years, Enfield’s mark of 92.5 percent shooting from the foul line when he played at Johns Hopkins University was the highest in the history books. It’s a rather unknown fact about the men’s basketball coach at USC, and he doesn’t mind.
“You don’t have to quote me on this,” he said, recalling his percentage. “I don’t like to talk about myself.”
It’s a common theme for Enfield. Mention the reason why he came across USC’s radar — his rise to fame as the head coach at the Florida Gulf Coast team that made an improbable Cinderella run to the Sweet Sixteen in 2013 — and he’ll credit the players he had on that team. Ask about how he’s turned USC from a perennial Pac-12 bottom feeder to a team with realistic Final Four hopes, and he’ll list off his coaching staff and point to the work the players have put in.
“I’m only as good as my coaching staff and players,” he said. “That’s what it takes to build a program.”
A genuine coach
Sitting behind his desk in his office on the ground floor of the Galen Center, Enfield can appear imposing. He is tall, lanky and speaks with a distinct drawl. Every word seems calculated and thought-out.
But beneath his serious exterior lies a funny, genuine man, according to his players. Senior guard and team captain Jordan McLaughlin, who was part of Enfield’s initial recruiting class and has played under him all four years, said Enfield has helped him improve each season as a player. 
“As a person, he’s even better,” McLaughlin said. “He’s become a part of my family.”
Enfield loves to joke, even at awkward times.
“Even when we’re in a dark situation, he’ll find a way to make light of it,” sophomore guard Jonah Mathews said. “Corny jokes, but they’re kind of funny.”
Senior guard Elijah Stewart, another member of Enfield’s original recruiting class, has also heard many of Enfield’s attempts at humor.
“He always talks about his playing days,” Stewart said. “Sometimes, he’ll make a joke like, ‘I could give you 30 [points] if you’re playing defense like that.’”
Or,  Mathews said, whenever he shoots a deep 3-pointer, Enfield pounces.
“It’s not the Santa Monica Pier,” Enfield will say to Mathews, who is from Santa Monica.
It’s this atmosphere that makes players comfortable. Enfield gives his players leeway on the court.
“He gives us offensive freedom,” Stewart said. “If you break the play, you better make [the shot]. He has trust in us.”
Enfield also lets his players explore different aspects of the game, not limiting them to just what their strengths may be.
“If it works, he continues with it, even draws up a play for you,” Stewart said.
McLaughlin said that Enfield has an open-door policy for his players off the court.
“Nobody’s afraid to walk up to him and talk to him,” McLaughlin said. “He’s really approachable. It goes a long way. Especially as a head coach of a team, you don’t want your players to be scared to talk to you. It allows us to talk to him whenever we need to.”
And the topics extend beyond basketball.
“Sometimes, you’ve got programs [where] coaches will just talk to you about basketball stuff,” Mathews said. “But Coach Enfield will talk to you about class, about family, about anything, really.”
Mathews added that Enfield is not a “fake guy” — as in, genuine and honest.
“He’ll tell you straight-up,” Mathews said. “He’s not going to beat around the bush, on the court or off the court.”
Shooting guru
Enfield, who turned 48 this year, has spent his life in basketball. Hailing from Shippensburg, Pa., a small town three hours west of Philadelphia with a population of less than 6,000, Enfield watched his father, Bill, coach the local ninth grade basketball team and then the high school varsity team.
“I was in a basketball family,” he said. “Basketball was my favorite and my best sport, so I decided to quit all the other sports I played — baseball, football, track and field — and just concentrate on basketball.”
His strength was his jump shot. He was a sharpshooter in high school, and when the 3-point line was introduced during his college days, he shot nearly 50 percent from beyond-the-arc at Johns Hopkins.
Enfield’s shooting touch launched his coaching career. Post-college, and armed with an MBA from the University of Maryland after graduating from John Hopkins with an economics degree, Enfield started a shooting consulting business called All Net Business. He produced an instructional video on shooting techniques, and offered his services to NBA teams and players.
At first, he said, it was a struggle to attract clients.
“It was challenging to try to create a market, so to speak, because it wasn’t as prevalent — there weren’t a lot of specialization coaches in the ’80s and ’90s,” Enfield said.
He eventually found players, and by 1994, the Milwaukee Bucks brought him on as a shooting coach. In 1998, he received a promotion, jumping to an assistant coaching role under Rick Pitino with the Boston Celtics.

After a stint outside basketball as vice president of a health care startup, Enfield went back to the coaching ranks in 2006 as an assistant at Florida State. It was there that he started a family with his wife, Amanda, a model who has been on the covers of Vogue, Maxim and Elle (in an oft-reported story, they did indeed meet in 2003 when Enfield, through a mutual friend, offered her a ride from New York City to Boston for an NCAA Tournament game), with two of his three children born in Tallahassee, Fla.
In 2011, he landed his first head coaching gig at Florida Gulf Coast — and two years later, in the wake of Dunk City fame, he got the call from USC. And he said, “yes,” despite knowing he would be moving an entire family, with three young children, across the country.
“Hopefully, it’s beneficial,” Enfield said of his thinking at the time. “Sometimes you just don’t know. You just take a chance. My wife was on board.”
Enfield carried over his career experiences — the shooting expertise, the business acumen — to USC. The first thing he did was bring in assistants that he believed would help build his program.
“At the time, you appreciate the opportunity you’re given as a head coach when you come to USC, and then you hire a great staff,” he said. “Very thankful to coaches we hired and their creativity and vision to try to put a plan in place to build a program the way we thought it could be built.”
And on the court, Enfield’s shooting advice has worked wonders for his players. According to McLaughlin, Enfield has one-on-one sessions with players, 15 minutes before practice begins. 
“He has a shooting strap that we use to keep our thumb out of the shot,” McLaughlin said. “Just getting your form right, practicing form shooting. He does that with everyone.”
The change in McLaughlin’s shooting was immediate — the point guard went from shooting 27 percent from 3-point range his freshman year to 42 percent his sophomore year.
Mathews, too, has seen positive results from Enfield’s mentoring. He’s learned to get his thumb out when rotating the ball, a minor tweak that he said has improved his shot.
It’s all been a gradual process, and the results are coming in gradual waves. USC won just 11 games in Enfield’s first season, but that number increased to 12 the following year, then to 21 and last season 26, when the team came within a few points of advancing to the Sweet Sixteen.
This season, the Trojans entered the campaign ranked No. 10 in the preseason AP Poll, their highest preseason ranking since the 1974-75 season. McLaughlin said that with higher expectations, Enfield has become stricter.
“We’re not going to be ranked No. 10 and blow it all away,” McLaughlin said. “When you’re ranked 10, it comes with more responsibility. You’ve got to work that much harder.”

Stewart thinks Enfield has gained more confidence, now that he’s among the top coaches in the nation.
“Despite the confidence boost, he’s not changed his demeanor,” Stewart said. “He might put on some Louis Vuitton suits or stuff like that.”
When adversity hits
On Sunday night, the shot doctor’s team wasn’t making its shots.
USC was playing No. 16 Texas A&M at the Galen Center in a big test against another top-20 team. And it was laying an egg.
USC’s best player, junior forward Bennie Boatwright, was bricking open looks from distance. Stewart, a knockdown shooter, couldn’t buy a 3-pointer. Neither could Mathews, who made just one of eight field goal attempts.
The packed student section cleared out midway through the second half — its loudest cheer of the game coming when it won free Chick-fil-A.
The Trojans shot just 28 percent as a team and were a woeful 26 percent from deep. They scored a season-low 59 points, lost by 16 and dropped out of the top-10 in the rankings.
Enfield could’ve easily chalked the loss up to a bad shooting night. He could’ve singled out players for taking ill-advised shots or made an excuse about a post-Thanksgiving hangover. Instead, he took the blame, head-on.
“I’ll take the blame for that,” Enfield said in the postgame press conference. “Whatever I did to prepare the team obviously did not work. Whether it’s their legs are tired, or we didn’t get enough shooting in this week or maybe I had the wrong rotations in. This game is on me. This is the worst we’ve shot the ball from the field since we’ve been here in five years. It’s on me.”
This is Andy Enfield in a nutshell — the genuine, straight-up figure who has turned the men’s basketball program into a Final Four contender in less than five years. In good times, he credits everyone else. In bad times, he blames himself.
There could be more bad times to come. The elephant in the room this season, even as the team aims for historic success, will be what comes of the criminal case against associate head coach Tony Bland, who pleaded not guilty to charges that include wire fraud and bribery after he allegedly funneled money to families of recruits and offered to lead players to agents in exchange for cash. Sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton, a starter last season, is likely one of the players caught up in the scandal; he has yet to play in a game this year, with the school admitting issues regarding eligibility.
The ramifications could be serious, if the NCAA chooses to slap sanctions on the program or if an internal investigation currently being conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, who USC hired, leads to self-imposed punishments.
Enfield deflected questions about the pending case.
“It has been emotional: It has been challenging on a personal level and on a program level,” Enfield said. “However, right now our focus is what we can control.”
What they can control is winning with this current group of players, which might be USC’s best roster assembled in decades. There are bona fide veterans in McLaughlin, Stewart, Boatwright and junior forward Chimezie Metu. There are promising sophomores in Mathews, Melton and forward Nick Racocevic. There is Derryck Thornton, a redshirt sophomore transfer guard from Duke. And there is an impressive crop of freshmen, including Charles O’Bannon Jr. and Jordan Usher.
“This is what, in our eyes, a program should look like,” Enfield said. “You’ve got a good mix of upperclassmen that are experienced and you have new players coming in who need to get improved.”
But Enfield doesn’t want to talk about how great he’s done or whether everything’s going to plan. He just wants to see his players improve, and he’ll go from there.
“A successful season is to have these players reach their potential,” Enfield said. “We don’t know how good this team can be, but we’re going to find out.”
Great article highlighting Andy’s impressive academic and athletic accomplishments. Truly a brilliant coach and person!
Really long useless article. He is still is a lousy game coach.
