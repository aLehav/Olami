Alumna Vanessa Luna first became interested in affordable housing after working in the Center for Economic Development at USC. She now serves as the housing director for Clifford Beers Housing. (Photo courtesy of Vanessa Luna)
USC alumna Vanessa Luna is overseeing the development of the King 1101 Apartments, an affordable housing project for homeless families and veterans located in Exposition Park. Often referring to the development as her “baby,” Luna is excited about her first project at Clifford Beers Housing, a company that creates affordable homes, and its positive effect on the South Los Angeles community.
As the housing director of CBH, Luna has taken charge of the project’s planning, funding and construction. The apartments are set to open Jan. 18, 2019.
“[Our mission is] giving people stable housing and keeping that housing beautifully maintained with services providing people what they need to find jobs and be productive,” said Audrey Peterson, the assistant project manager at CBH.
Luna first became interested in providing affordable housing through her work at the Center for Economic Development at USC and her fellowship with Housing and Urban Development. After earning a master’s degree in planning from the Price School of Public Policy and working at the Skid Row Housing Trust, Luna transferred to CBH in 2013.
“[King 1101 Apartments] is the first development that I started from inception when I came over to Clifford Beers, so we’ve been working on it since 2014,” Luna said. “It took a long time to put together all of the financing for the project.” 
According to Luna, King Apartments will have a total of 26 units with a mix of studio, one bedroom and three bedroom apartments. Special offices in the building house the case manager and service coordinators, which help to provide mental health services, individualized plans and additional information about job training, therapy and support groups. Luna said service coordinators will also occasionally host art and cooking events to engage tenants. 
Claire Okeke, the communications manager at CBH, said one special feature of the apartments is a ground-floor space for a local business. 
“We want to contribute to responsible community development and not displace local businesses that are being [kicked out because of] high rent,” Okeke said. “So we’re going to be renting that to a locally established historical business from South Los Angeles.” 
The apartments also have certified green sustainable features, such as solar water heating, a green roof and space for electric vehicle charging, according to Okeke. 
During the planning process, Luna said she faced an unexpected problem in 2016, right before she was supposed to close the project deal with an investor and begin construction. 
“In 2016, the elections happened and the fact that [Donald] Trump was elected [president] wreaked havoc with our tax credit market,” Luna said. “Because he lowered the corporate tax rate, investors weren’t as excited about investing and getting the tax credits for our developments. We had a financing gap on that project … which was over $800,000.”
Okeke said that few directors would have been able to handle the challenges of funding that came with developing King Apartments. 
“Vanessa has really helped transform the organization,” Okeke said. “[She’s] made a difference for 685 families that were formerly homeless. She’s a great leader.”
Luna’s goal with King Apartments is to provide permanent supportive housing to individuals who are at risk of retreating into the cycle of homelessness. Permanent supportive housing lacks a time limit, according to Luna, so residents can stay as long as they require the social services and stability offered by King Apartments. 
“Our goal is to get them housed first and foremost,” Luna said. “After that, we hope to support them so that they can remain stably housed and be successful in addressing whatever other challenges they are facing.”

VoteSC hosted an event on National Voter Registration Day, when it registered nearly 500 voters. This year, VoteSC signed up a total of 2,000 student voters through the online platform TurboVote. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
VoteSC signed up an estimated 2,000 student voters by Monday’s California voter registration deadline, a substantial increase from the 411 students were registered in 2016. 
VoteSC used the online platform TurboVote, which helps users register to vote, receive absentee ballots and be reminded of important deadlines. 
Previously, VoteSC set up a “Midterm Monday” table on Trousdale Parkway every week to register students and answer questions about the election. On National Voter Registration Day, it hosted an event that registered nearly 500 students. 
Now, VoteSC will focus on reminding student voters to head to the polls on Nov. 6 or send in their absentee ballots by their respective state’s deadlines. 
During the voting process, VoteSC plans to have free stamps at Customer Service Desks throughout campus for students mailing absentee ballots, according to Unruh Associates Director Eleonora Viotto. 
Briana Miles, director of the Political Student Assembly, said pushing for student voter registration from the start of the semester rather than having a National Voter Registration Day drive alone would be more efficient. She also said buying the TurboVote software improved these numbers by making it easier for all students to register. 
“[TurboVote] makes everything so much easier,” Miles said. “You don’t always have to have somebody right there handing out a paper form and making sure they’re filling it out correctly. Everyone can interact with it wherever they are.”
Viotto said that VoteSC will host an election viewing party in Wallis Annenberg Hall for students on Nov. 6. 
Viotto said she encourages registered students to vote so they can use their voices to help shape policy. 
“If everyone that is registered to vote showed up to the polls on election day, whatever they voted as a block would be the law of the land because there’s just so many Generation Z and millennials now that we outnumber every other demographic,” Viotto said. “If we want to shape the country to reflect our values and what we think our country should be, then we need to show up to the polls and really vote the way that we say we will.”
Going forward, USG Director of External Affairs Alec Vandenberg said VoteSC wants to reach out to the University administration to better integrate voting and voter registration into campus. With help from administrators, Vandenberg said VoteSC could reach all undergraduate and graduate students. 
Viotto said that she hopes VoteSC will continue after she graduates. The coalition paid for the TurboVote platform through 2020, but she said they hope administrators will also help invest in the software. 
She also said that she would like USC to adopt some of UCLA’s practices, including registering eligible student voters during new student orientations and encouraging more students to become politically involved. 
“We’re really hoping to take what we’ve learned this year and all the results that we were able to achieve and really show them the value of investing in this platform and making it a part of USC’s culture the way other schools, like UCLA for example, have embraced it,” Viotto said.
Vandenberg said the coalition also hopes to find ways to encourage political participation in non-election years and eventually reach out to high school students.
“In terms of campus culture, if I could see excitement around voting in off-election years, not even just midterm election years,” Vandenberg said. “I think that would be really rewarding just to kind of solidify that into the campus fabric that civic engagement extends throughout time.”

The Radio Television Digital News Association recognized Annenberg TV News with the National Student Murrow Award for Excellence in Video Newscast, on Monday. ATVN was recognized for its coverage of the false alarm campus shooting alert that happened in October 2017. 
The coverage, in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, was on a professor who falsely informed her students that there was an active shooter in Fertitta Hall. The reports of gunfire triggered a campus-wide police response.
A group of 42 student journalists on the ATVN team covered the breaking news, according to USC alumna and former ATVN Executive Producer Samantha Bergum.
“These outstanding student journalists represent not only the future of journalism, but also the professional level of reporting that student journalists are already bringing news audiences across the country,” said Scott Libin, the Chair of RTDNA, according to the association’s website. 
ATVN covered the breaking news on the shooting, gave informed eyewitness reactions and provided important actionable information to the USC community, RTDNA’s website said.
Bergum accepted the award at the event along with ATVN Faculty Director Stacy Scholder.
“I was shocked and pleasantly surprised when we won,” Bergum said. “More than anything, I think it’s just a testament to good journalism … it was a really significant day and a day that reminds you why journalism is so important to communities in crisis.”
Bergum said that the way the Annenberg newsroom came together amid the chaos on campus was inspiring.
“It was all hands on deck to cover the important story,” Bergum said. “Though I got to be on stage accepting the award, it’s truly, to me, an award for the whole newsroom.”
Daniel Toomey, an anchor of the broadcast that night and a junior majoring in journalism, described the media center as hectic when the news broke. 
“Not only were we covering this crazy thing that was happening on campus, but we were covering Vegas as well,” Toomey said. “It really [tested] your ability to work under pressure … You were dealing with two sensitive subjects on a super tight schedule.”
Toomey said that everyone at ATVN knew that they had to get the job done that day.
“You could definitely understand that our newsroom was locked in that day … and was determined to get an episode out,” Toomey said.
He also credits Bergum with helping with organizing and leading the newsroom during the shooting alert. 
“You wondered at points, when working with Sam, what she was doing in a college newsroom,” Toomey said. “You walk into a newsroom and … you [realize] that things are crazy … but you [knew] that if Sam is there, then you are going to come out with a good broadcast either way.”

USG Senate voted Tuesday to pass a resolution that asked the USC Credit Union to waive a fee associated with students registering for absentee ballots. (Aamani Ponnekanti | Daily Trojan)
At Tuesday’s Undergraduate Student Government meeting, Sen. Michaela Murphy introduced a resolution she co-authored with USG Director of External Affairs Alec Vandenberg to help out-of-state students vote with absentee ballots. 
Several states currently require voters to get their absentee voting ballots notarized, or verified. USC Credit Union offers this service for $10, according to Murphy. The resolution asked USC Credit Union to work with USG to waive the notarization fee. 
“This $10 fee creates a potential barrier for out-of-state students to be able to exercise their fundamental, democratic right to vote,” the resolution stated. 
It also noted that only 21 percent of eligible 18-to 24-year-old students voted in the last midterm election.
Murphy and Vandenberg said they found out about the $10 notarization fee last Friday and immediately began authoring the resolution. After the resolution passed unanimously, Vandenberg and Murphy asked the Senate for $300 to cover a portion of absentee ballot notarizations. 
Murphy said she doubts there will be enough time between the resolution’s passing and the upcoming midterm elections for any policy changes to be established. Because the notarization fees will likely not be waived for this election, the $300 Murphy requested will help cover 30 students’ notarization fees before the absentee voting deadline, depending on the state of residence. 
“The long-term ask is to continue collaboration with USC Credit Union to try to fully waive this fee in 2020,” Murphy said.
Sen. Jacquelyne Tan was concerned that the senate fund is not the appropriate place to draw money for subsidizing the notarization fees because this incurred fee does not affect international students. The fund, she said, should go toward initiatives that benefit all students.
“International students pay to this fund,” Tan said. “It’s meant to be for programming or initiatives that are open to all students, but this isn’t.”
Mae Gates, a sophomore majoring in public policy, defended the use of the senate fund to subsidize notarization fees.
“By giving these funds to ensure that all eligible students are able to vote back in their home states, you’re also empowering international students, because the things we’re voting on right now in the United States affect literally everyone who exists in these lands,” Gates said.
Murphy also said that historically, the senate fund goes to just a few people and that this allocation would be a significant improvement.
“I know that in the past, this money really has been spent on one or two people going to conferences,” Murphy said. “That really didn’t help with outreach. It really didn’t help with getting everybody supported with the fund from Senate.”
After the discussion, the Senate approved the $300 allocation unanimously. 
Vandenberg said he hopes that even if the USC Credit Union does not waive the notarization fee this year, a better policy will be in place for the 2020 elections. 
“What give us hope is at least we’re starting the dialogue,” Vandenberg said. “At the very least, in future election years we won’t have to [have] these barriers and challenges.”

Senior Logan Smith defeated redshirt senior Tanner Smith in the ITA Southwest Regionals singles finals to claim the title in a three-set match at David Marks Stadium. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Over the weekend, the men’s tennis team found success at Pepperdine during the ITA Southwest Regionals tournament, which ended with two Trojans going head-to-head in the singles finals. 
All eight men had a first round bye and won their second round matches with the exception of senior Jack Jaede. The third round provided an interesting matchup as redshirt senior Tanner Smith faced off against his younger cousin and No. 1 seed, UCLA’s Keegan Smith. With an emphatic 6-1, 6-3 win, Tanner Smith booked his spot in the next round. Junior Riley Smith and freshman Bradley Frye lost in the same round.   
The fourth round saw all five Trojans advance to the quarterfinals on Saturday. Tanner Smith squared off against teammate Jaede and came out with the 6-4, 7-6(4) win. Joining Tanner Smith in the semifinals was Logan Smith. Jake Sands and Daniel Cuckierman both fell in straight sets.
In the semifinals Sunday, Tanner Smith won 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. Logan Smith was also victorious with a 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win. The unseeded Tanner Smith and No. 6 Logan Smith faced off in the finals on Monday at Marks Stadium. Logan Smith claimed the title over his teammate in three sets.
All four of USC’s double teams did not have to play until the round of 32, as they entered the tournament with a bye. In this round, the men’s doubles teams had a perfect showing, going 4-0 on the day. Among these wins, the No. 40 team of  Cukierman and Tanner Smith had the most dominant performance, defeating Loyola Marymount’s junior Ryan Brown and sophomore Diego Nava 8-2. 
The semifinals on Monday became  a tie-breaking affair, where the team of freshman August Holmgreen and junior Joel Gamerov prevailed over Brandon Holt and Smith by the score of 3-6, 6-3, (12-10).
The Women of Troy also played their regional tournament in San Diego.
All seven advanced to the second round, where five of the seven Trojans fell. Freshmen Danielle Willson and Salma Ewing advanced into the third round and both won their next matches 6-1, 6-0 and 6-2, 6-3, respectively. The fourth round proved to be the end of Willson’s singles campaign as she lost 6-2, 6-2. Ewing beat UCLA senior Alaina Miller to reach the quarterfinals. 
Monday saw Ewing play in the finals, where she dropped the first set 6-3. It was the first time she had lost a set the entire tournament. She went on to win the next two sets 6-2, 6-2 and claim her first collegiate singles title.
The women’s doubles teams put up a strong showing as well, with two pairs of teams reaching the quarterfinals. These teams included the No. 27 ranked doubles team of junior Angela Kulikov and senior Rianna Valdes and the doubles team of junior Constance Branstine and junior Becca Weissmann. The team had one other doubles team compete in the tournament that consisted of Ewing and Willson. 
The men’s team will compete in their next tournament this weekend in the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships on the home court. The women’s team plays its next tournament starting Nov. 2 at the Jack Kramer Invitational in Rolling Hills.

Freshman linebacker Palaie Gaoteote lead the team with nine tackles against Colorado and had 11 tackles in Utah. (Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan)
Freshman linebacker Palaie Gaoteote lowered his helmet and exploded into Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault, making the tackle that would leave him on the ground for a few minutes after the play. Gaoteote knocked himself out.
When asked if he knew immediately after the play that he had a concussion, he grinned.
“Nah,” Gaoteote said. “Shoot, it’s just football. Just playing, big hits come and go. It was kind of funny — that’s why I walked off smiling.”
Gaoteote’s speed is striking for a player his size. At 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, you might expect him to lumber around the field and struggle to keep up with quicker playmakers. But this is not so with the youngster that teammates and coaches alike affectionately know as “EA.” Gaoteote often appears to be shot out of a cannon when plugging a running lane or tracking a receiver with his ability to accelerate at a moment’s notice.
USC football has had a chaotic season, but the rise of Gaoteote has been one of the bright spots. Even while Gaoteote sat out much of fall camp and the first two games of the season with a slight meniscus tear, USC coaches could hardly contain their excitement about the former five-star recruit out of Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas.
In two games since taking over at middle linebacker for injured senior Cameron Smith, Gaoteote hasn’t let his coaches down. In USC’s 31-20 victory over Colorado on Oct. 13, the true freshman hailing from Hawaii led the team with nine total tackles, despite playing just over a half of the contest. Even in the Trojans’ disappointing 41-28 loss to Utah on Saturday, Gaoteote showcased his talent with 11 tackles and his first collegiate sack. 
But athleticism isn’t the only marker of Gaoteote’s youth. The true freshman seems impervious to negativity. When asked how he felt the Wednesday after his head injury, Gaoteote smiled before saying he felt well and was improving every day. Even after USC’s lackluster defensive effort against the Utes, Gaoteote refused to say anything negative.
 “We played good, really well,” Gaoteote said. “We flew to everything, just did the best we could do and continued to do it.”
It was clear Gaoteote was unfazed by the blowout when he said he knew the Trojans would win this week’s home game against Arizona State. Some may call this proclamation after a significant loss naive or arrogant, but Gaoteote’s earnest confidence is something the Trojans could use a lot more of right now.
He has been one of the Trojans’ most productive players during his limited time on the field, even while taking over as the defensive signal-caller in Smith’s absence. This is quite an impressive load for a true freshman to carry, especially considering all the time Gaoteote missed to start the season, and shows that Gaoteote already reads the game at a veteran level.
“I’ve said this before, that linebacker position is like being a quarterback of the defense in terms of having to make calls and make adjustments,” head coach Clay Helton said to the Los Angeles Times last week. “You’re literally a quarterback back there trying to make those calls, plus doing your own job. I’m so impressed with what he [has done], and I think the future is extremely bright.”
Gaoteote’s positive attitude also manifests itself in his response to success, and he credits his teammates for helping him into a position to produce.
“I was really comfortable,” Gaoteote said the Wednesday after the Colorado game. “It just came from the other guys like [redshirt junior linebacker] John [Houston], and the defensive linemen, playing off of them. My teammates as a whole made it easy for me to be out there, and just have fun with it.”
It’s still early to tell, but Gaoteote has the chance to live up to the hype and become the next great USC linebacker. At the very least, it certainly seems clear that he was destined to be a Trojan; Gaoteote said he models his game after USC great Troy Polamalu and his idol Junior Seau.
There was speculation before the season that Gaoteote could earn the right to wear the No. 55 jersey that USC legends such as Seau and Willie McGinest made iconic during their time at the school. He ended up with No. 1, but a continuation of his strong start could change that. Don’t be surprised if Gaoteote eventually earns that honor only bestowed upon the best this blue-blood program has to offer.

Senior forward Leah Pruitt has scored 10 goals, a season high for her career as a Trojan. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The women’s soccer team will face a test as they travel to Colorado on Thursday to take on the Buffaloes.
The Trojans are playing some of their best soccer all season after scoring 10 goals in their last two games against Oregon State and Oregon while conceding none. Following its weekend display, USC now stands at a 14-1-1 record on the year.
Over the weekend, the Trojans introduced a new element to their game that they hadn’t shown much of all season. The Women of Troy have had a lot of shots in games, but haven’t been able to put a lot of them on frame. The team has addressed this issue in practice and has worked on creating more opportunities from wider positions. This was evident in the link-up play and the chances the team created to score its goals in Sunday’s game against Oregon.
“Colorado plays a little bit differently, but some of the elements from this weekend will definitely be in play,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said after the Oregon game. “I think the width will be important for us, but they have such a great counterattack. We’ve got to be careful that even as we attack and create width that we defend well against their two forwards and their attacking midfielder, because they’ve been scoring a lot of goals.”
Colorado currently holds a 13-1-3 record overall on the season. Despite its record, Colorado has been overlooked at times in the rankings due to its lack of quality victories. However, prior to this weekend, the Buffaloes had not lost a game all season despite playing in a competitive Pac-12 conference.
Stanford is currently the top-ranked team in the country, but to lose 7-0 to any team will take away some positive momentum.
It doesn’t get easier for Colorado either as it takes on No. 2 USC Thursday and No. 9 UCLA on Sunday. Facing three top-10 teams in the span of a week will put a toll on any team, no matter how much talent they possess, so the Trojans must look to take advantage of the situation.
“By the time they finish that stretch [of games], everyone in the country will know how legit they are and what kind of a team they are,” McAlpine said. “But I have always thought they are impressive. They are sound defensively, their goalkeeper is a senior. They returned a lot of quality upperclassmen. So, we will lock in and try to continue to move the ball and put shots on frame.”
This season, Colorado has scored 46 goals and conceded 15. Redshirt senior Jorian Baucom has been a key factor in the goals and assists department for the Buffaloes. In 17 games played, she has 12 goals and six assists on the season. Not far behind is junior Tatum Barton, who has 11 goals and four assists on the season. The creative spark of this team is junior Taylor Kornieck who has eight goals and 10 assists. The Trojans must prepare for these players, all of whom are deadly on the counterattack.
The Trojans have similarly scored 45 goals on the year, but hold a better defensive record than the Buffaloes, having only conceded seven goals to date. Freshman forward Penelope Hocking has been a leading contributor for the Trojans with 28 points on the year from 12 goals and four assists while coming off the bench in most games. Senior forward Leah Pruitt has also put up 28 points this season from 10 goals and eight assists. To round the bunch out, redshirt sophomore Savannah DeMelo has contributed six goals and a team-leading nine assists.
USC vs. Colorado will take place in Boulder on Thursday at 2 p.m.

Freshman quarterback JT Daniels is currently on concussion protocol, and his ability to play in Saturday’s game remains questionable. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Following a disheartening road loss to Utah riddled with player injuries, the football team prepares to take on Arizona State Saturday with some uncertainty.
Head coach Clay Helton praised the Sun Devils’ talent, and is not overlooking their 3-4 start.
“Don’t be fooled by the record,” Helton said. “They [were] impressive when they went up to Washington, … at Colorado and at Stanford.”
With freshman starting quarterback JT Daniels in concussion protocol and sophomore backup quarterback Matt Fink out with three fractured ribs, redshirt freshman quarterback Jack Sears continued to receive first string reps. The team is looking to simplify the game plan on offense given Sears’ limited preparation time by emphasizing his capacity to create dynamic plays with his running ability and short throws to slowly move the ball down the field. 
Quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis provided his assessment on Sears from fall training camp to Tuesday.
“He’s really athletic — that’s a good thing,” Ellis said. “We’ll have to move him around a little bit. He’s got a really strong arm. He had a great fall camp. It wasn’t necessarily his fault that he was named the third string guy. We just happened to have some good quarterbacks on our roster.”
Ellis believes Sears is up to the challenge mentally. 
“What I like about him is he’s prepared everyday like he is going to get an opportunity to play,” Ellis said. “He’s a smart kid, he’s been engaged the whole time, and we’ll see where we are at with the plan, what he knows, what he likes and hopefully go out there and play Saturday.”
Ellis also didn’t rule out a Daniels return.
“If [Daniels] gets to play, then he’ll get to play,” Ellis said. “And if not, then we’ll have to move on without him. [Daniels is] a football junkie, so he’s still studying like he’s gonna be the starter, and he still may. We’ll see where he’s at.”
Given USC’s record with injuries lately, the coaching staff isn’t putting all their stock on one player. They are also preparing walk-ons redshirt sophomore Holden Thomas and junior Brandon Perdue.
Daniels, who completed 6-of-16 passes with a touchdown and two interceptions on Saturday, has had an up-and-down season, but his burgeoning connection with junior wide receiver Michael Pittman and longtime chemistry with freshman wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown has helped steady an otherwise shaky offense. The team will have to adjust to Sears’ mobile playstyle and restricted play-calling options.
For now, the team is sticking to its next-man-up approach and is ready to rally behind whoever is under center.
“He’s got the talent,” Ellis said. “I got no doubt in my mind that we can win a football game with Sears, and that’s what we plan to do on Saturday.”
Sears downplayed any nervousness heading into Saturday’s game.
“Lot of preparation, lot of the time in the film room,” Sears said. “Just preparing like I always prepare, whether it’s week one, two or this past week.”
Sears also said that situations like these prove the importance of always being prepared.
“Coach preaches every week to prepare like you’re the starter,” Sears said. “If you’re not getting the physical reps, you’ve got to get the mental reps. Obviously it’s hard [not playing] as a competitor, but at the same time, watching [Fink] and [Daniels] go along the process, string them along, helping them out anyway I can and prepared as if I have to go in when my name is called.”
Injury update
Senior linebacker Cameron Smith was held out of practice with a hamstring strain. Daniels remains in concussion protocol but is progressing well, according to Helton. Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware was limited with a sore shoulder but practiced. Senior cornerback Jonathan Lockett is still recovering from a hip injury, and freshman cornerback Olaijah Griffin is limited with a shoulder injury.

It’s not the easiest time to be a USC football fan — the team physically can’t win games outside of the Coliseum and I wouldn’t trust offensive coordinator Tee Martin to call my plays in NCAA 14.
But I’m not here to rant about the program’s many, many flaws (if you’re still seething from the Utah loss, check out Monday’s edition of “Grinding Gears”). Instead, I’d like to focus on the positives of USC football — like its former players who are no longer hamstrung by an inept coaching staff. 
Several Trojans are balling out in the big leagues right now, which begs the question: Who is the best former USC player in the NFL right now?
I’ll first lay down some criteria. Only current contributions to a team count; prior accomplishments don’t. Packers linebacker Clay Matthews possesses a Hall of Fame-caliber resume, but at age 32, he’s not the fearsome pass rusher he once was. He’s no longer a contender for best NFL Trojan.
And in order to weigh different positions evenly, I’ll be judging players based on their raw importance to their teams. For example, Titans defensive lineman Jurrell Casey doesn’t always stuff a stat sheet, but he’s a cornerstone of Tennessee’s defense more so than fellow “Trotan” Adoree Jackson, who has intercepted two passes in 2018. Any inactive or injured players are out of the race.
With that said, it’s time to decide who the best Trojan in the NFL is, in order to distract ourselves from an inevitable trip to the Sun Bowl. The contending players will be categorized into three tiers:
The Baby Trojans
This section belongs to rookie Trojans who’ve shown flashes of potential, but simply need more time to solidify themselves as NFL stars. This year’s No. 3 overall pick, quarterback Sam Darnold, is the most prominent of the group. Having started all seven games for the Jets, Darnold is still turnover-prone like he was in college (10 interceptions). However, he’s led the Mean Green to three wins — an impressive feat considering the team’s 5-11 finish in each of the past two years.
Rounding out the group are pass rusher Uchenna Nwosu (one sack, three QB hits) and running back Ronald Jones, who punched in his first career touchdown Sunday. This trio needs time to see their talents fully realized in the NFL.
The Role Players
Unlike the Baby Trojans, this group features established veterans with major starting roles on their teams.  Wide receiver Nelson Agholor and cornerback Adoree Jackson are pushing into the “Superstar” category, but need a few more years of sustained excellence to qualify. A former first-round pick, Agholor got off to a molasses-slow start, averaging 23.1 receiving yards per game in his first two seasons. 
But in 2017, he became a key weapon on the Super Bowl champion Eagles, racking up 768 yards and eight touchdowns. It’s just his second year as a pro, but Jackson is already ranked as the No. 16 cornerback in the NFL this season, according to Pro Football Focus. He’s well on his way to become an elite corner at this pace.
Defensive tackle Antuan Woods and running back Javorius “Buck” Allen were each part of USC’s class of 2015, and both have carved out solid roles for themselves in the NFL. Woods has started all seven games for the Cowboys at nose-tackle, notching 20 tackles and two for loss, while Allen scored three touchdowns in the Ravens’ first three games. Still waiting on a true breakout year, Allen rushed for over 500 yards in 2015 and 2017.
The Superstars
Now, we reach the cream of the crop — the Trojans who are established stars in the NFL. Receiver Robert Woods is the wild card of the Superstar group, as he’s yet to notch a 1,000-yard season. But he broke out in 2017 with 65.1 yards per game, and continued his explosive play into this season. He currently leads the Rams with 602 receiving yards — good for No. 9 in the league.
Joining him are perennial defensive stalwarts Leonard Williams and Jurrell Casey. Williams experienced a down year in 2017, notching just two sacks. He’s reemerged as a fearsome rusher in 2018, however, with three sacks in seven games. Casey is one of the longer tenured Trojans in the NFL, having joined the Titans in 2011. Since then, he’s piled up 42.5 sacks and 74 tackles for loss, en route to three career Pro Bowl appearances.
Last but not least, Tyron Smith has been the NFL’s premier left tackle this decade. He’s a five-time Pro-Bowler, two-time All-Pro selection and likely future Hall of Famer. The Cowboys offense has sputtered in 2018, but hardly at any fault of Smith’s.
The Ultimate Trojan
Here we are. It’s finally time to name the best Trojan currently in the NFL.
 Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is just a second-year pro, but he’s already managed to build a valuable brand for himself on and off the field. Last season, he was becoming a favorite target of Ben Roethlisberger, leading all rookie receivers with 917 yards and seven touchdowns. Now, he is the favorite target of Roethlisberger. He has more receptions and receiving yards than teammate Antonio Brown, who has more receiving yards than anyone in football since 2010.
Smith-Schuster is currently No. 6 in the NFL in receiving yards per game, and his total yards would rank higher if not for the Steelers’ bye week. If he’s not dazzling on the field, he’s probably starring off of it, whether in pizza commercials or YouTube escapades. Yet, he manages to back up his vivacious personality every week. Not only is Smith-Schuster more visible than any former Trojan in the NFL, he’s also the most productive of the group.
On top of it all, Smith-Schuster is only 21 years old. His crown of best Trojan in the NFL may be staying put for awhile.
