The new campaign, the largest individual campaign that Dornsife has ever undertaken, was announced at a special dinner held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The dinner not only marked the official launch of the campaign but also celebrated the second anniversary of Dana and David Dornsife’s $200 million naming gift to the college. Alumni, trustees, the Board of Councilors and friends of Dornsife joined in the celebration dinner as a thank you for their past investments and to inspire others to contribute to the campaign.
Since the September 2011 launch of the $6 billion schoolwide endowment campaign, some of the professional schools have launched their own campaigns. Each school’s contributions will contribute toward the $6 billion goal.
Senior Associate Dean for Advancement at Dornsife and a 1981 graduate Neil Macready said this event and the monetary contribution will allow the college to progress further.
“Ultimately, this campaign will help us create the first truly modern university,” Macready said.
The $750 million initiative will support need-based and merit-based scholarships and fellowships for both undergraduate and graduate students, new faculty appointments and a strategic innovation fund. In addition, the campaign will fund a number of existing university programs, including the Joint Education Project, international travel programs, research opportunities and internships. The funds will even allow some programs to be permanently endowed.
Macready is optimistic about the benefits the campaign will give both current and future Dornsife students.
“It gives us the opportunity to provide more scholarship support to our students and also allows them to broaden their experiences outside the classroom,” Macready said.
The initiative will also go toward recruitment of new faculty members as well as the implementation of a strategic innovation fund, which will help the university maintain its cutting-edge research. The initiative will allow Dornsife Dean Steve Kay to fund projects that would otherwise go unexplored.
“If there is a new area of research across the college where we don’t have the resources on hand to fund some groundbreaking research by faculty, having a strategic innovation fund will give us the flexibility to invest in that kind of program,” Macready said.

For a team that had been outscored 25-7 between March 3-6, USC baseball fared unexpectedly well during a weekend in which it faced three different top-25 teams.
No luck against Irish · The Trojans mustered seven hits against the No. 22 Fighting Irish, stranding the game-tying run at third base in the ninth inning. Their lone run was scored by second baseman Blake Lacey. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Taking on No. 14 Oklahoma and star pitcher Dillon Overton in the weekend opener on Friday, the Trojans played arguably their most complete game of the season en route to an impressive 5-3 win. Some 25 major league scouts — including a few MLB general managers — were in attendance at Dedeaux Field on Friday night to see Overton, but the Trojan bats jumped all over the projected first-round draft pick for 13 hits over eight innings, handing Overton his first loss of the year.
“That team is probably going to win the Big-12,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs after Friday’s win over the Sooners. “Overton is one of the best pitchers in the country. And we can go out there and beat him and bang out 13 hits on him. We played our game tonight.”
Hubbs has said throughout the season that USC will be able to compete with anyone in the country when the Trojans “play their game,” and that was evidenced on Friday. The Trojans had been embarrassed in their previous two games, with overanxious hitting overshadowed by unwatchable pitching. But junior ace Bobby Wheatley was in command all game against Oklahoma, tossing 6 1/3 innings while allowing just one earned run (three total) on seven hits with three strikeouts and three walks to his name.
The Trojan bullpen, responsible for 13 runs the previous two games, shut out the Sooners the last 2 2/3 innings, yielding just two baserunners. Sophomore Nigel Nootbaar threw a scoreless eighth and ninth to seal the victory.
“For Nootbaar to come out and shut the door like he did, that was really encouraging,” Hubbs said. “I just feel like we did a better job of letting the game come to us.”
Throughout USC’s three-game mini-losing streak heading into the weekend, the Trojans were an abysmal 5-for-35 with runners in scoring position and a .143 batting average. Hubbs and several players attributed this to the Trojans pressing at the plate, trying to do too much with pitches that were realistically unhittable.
“We did a much better job of finding a pitch that we can handle,” Hubbs said. “There’s a lot of pitches that look good that we can’t do anything with. We’ve been swinging at a lot of balls that are [chest-high], and they’re just fly-ball outs. And so we’ve made a really concerted effort to attack the ball the right way. We did a better job of finding the box that we can do things in.”
Senior infielder Adam Landecker, who was 3-for-4 with four RBIs in his first game back from a hamstring injury, echoed Hubbs’ sentiments.
“I feel like if I do well, it gets the team going,” Landecker said. “It was really a great team win against a great team, and hopefully we can build momentum off of it.”
The Trojans appeared to carry some of that momentum into Saturday’s matchup against No. 26 Notre Dame, but ultimately the Irish came away with a hard-fought 2-1 victory.
It was a classic pitcher’s duel as USC sophomore Wyatt Strahan battled Irish starter Adam Norton. Strahan tossed an impressive six innings of one-run ball, his lone blemish being a solo home run to Irish slugger Eric Jagielo.
But Strahan was bested by Norton’s seven stellar innings. The Trojans lone run came in the second when freshman infielder Blake Lacey doubled, advanced to third on a grounder and scored on a single by freshman outfielder Connor Sullivan.
The Trojans threatened in the ninth against Notre Dame closer Dan Slania, putting runners at the corners with one down for junior designated hitter Jake Hernandez. With two strikes, Hernandez attempted a gutsy suicide squeeze, but popped up the would-be game-tying bunt right to the Slania, who doubled off the runner at third to end the game in stunning fashion.

For all of his detractors who grumble about his predictable, cautious play-calling, no one can accuse USC head coach Lane Kiffin of not thinking outside the box in other ways. Of course, a great deal of that thinking has been controversial and not exactly aboveboard.
News broke just last week that NCAA will institute, for all intents and purposes, a “Kiffin Rule” requiring coaches to tell referees when they switch a player’s number so that the officials can announce it over the public address system. This move was precipitated by Kiffin’s now-infamous decision to have redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler don senior punter Kyle Negrete’s No. 35 jersey while sneaking for an unsuccessful two-point conversion against Colorado.
But shenanigans aside, Kiffin has also exercised creativity with his player personnel, especially given the lack of roster depth brought about by the sanctions. Once Kiffin identifies a talented player on his team buried on the depth chart at one position, he has time and time again moved the player to compete at another position.
Even with this in mind, perhaps the biggest surprise of spring football thus far is Kiffin’s decision to move freshman offensive lineman Max Tuerk to center. Kiffin has often praised Tuerk’s intelligence and foresees the 6-foot-6 behemoth adapting seamlessly to his new role, which will also require him to identify blitz packages and call out blocking assignments.
Kiffin sports a mostly successful record on these roster moves to date with only a couple of exceptions, so it’s difficult to second-guess him too much.
In fact, some of his moves later became transformative, including when he converted Dion Bailey into an All-Pac-12 linebacker after recruiting him as a safety.
Similarly, former USC captain Rhett Ellison credits his current NFL success as a special teamer to his change from tight end to fullback in his senior season. His increased versatility convinced the Minnesota Vikings to take him in the 2012 NFL draft’s fourth round — much earlier than projected entering the year.
His move also freed up more playing time for the talented tight end duo of Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer.
Yet not all of Kiffin’s roster tinkering has panned out. Most notably, 6-foot-3, 240-pound junior defensive end Devon Kennard lined up at middle linebacker in 2010 and looked completely out of his element as the quarterback of the defense.
In former defensive coach Monte Kiffin’s Tampa-2 defensive scheme, the middle linebacker needed to drop back constantly to defend the soft underbelly of the system: short passes over the middle. Of course, such a responsibility sapped Kennard of his explosive pass rushing, which will one day earn him a healthy NFL paycheck.
Unfortunately for USC, I believe Tuerk’s switch to center will come to resemble the Kennard misadventure at linebacker more than Bailey and Ellison’s successful moves — not because Tuerk can’t handle the position, but because USC needs him more at offensive tackle.
Three practices in, the early returns on Tuerk’s switch are decidedly mixed, as there have been numerous fumbled exchanges between the quarterback and center. But such mistakes will surely diminish with experience. More worrisome is the fact that Tuerk is not the ideal height for the position. If redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler, who is generally listed as 6-foot-1 on USC’s official roster, ultimately wins the starting quarterback nod, his field vision will be impaired by the towering Tuerk.
The greatest concern, however, is that Tuerk, a 2012 All Pac-12 honorable mention selection despite only starting five games as a freshman, represents USC’s best option at the all-important left tackle position. Tuerk’s athleticism is wasted at center. The move doesn’t make much sense for a player who doubled as a tight end in spurts this season, especially given the alternatives present.
Sophomore offensive tackle Aundrey Walker struggled last season to maintain his focus and tenacity throughout all four quarters, at times flashing the nastiness of former Trojan Matt Kalil on a pancake block and at other times getting beaten by a speed rush and then subsequently giving up and not even attempting to recover. By moving Walker’s principal competition for the starting left tackle spot, Kiffin fails to challenge the Cleveland native to maximize his potential.
Upon breaking in a new quarterback this season, it’s critical that USC improves its offensive line play. Last season, with a savvy and elusive fourth-year starting quarterback, the Trojans still suffered 17 sacks. If the offensive line play doesn’t improve and if Kiffin doesn’t put his linemen in the best position possible to succeed, it won’t matter who wins the starting quarterback job.
To succeed at any level, the quarterback needs to feel comfortable dropping back in the pocket. Whoever winds up taking over the reins of the offense will need maximum effort from Walker and trust that he will protect his blind side. If this doesn’t come to fruition, then the decision to move Tuerk to center will prove costly.

Agree, but this problem is not due to sanctions. The problem is Kiffin’s inability to recruit quality, intelligent OL. Three years, and his best recruit for the OL is Tuerk who, as you pointed out, looked to be the most promising LT on the team. 
He’s also under recruited every year.

This was it: the USC men’s basketball team’s final regular season game, against the disappointing Washington State Cougars, no less.
Offensive woes · Sophomore guard Byron Wesley (above) and the Trojans shot just 19-56 (33.9 percent) against Washington State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The end to a tumultuous season filled with more twists and turns than an unpredictable fiction novel. The last chance for the Trojans to prove what they are made of before their NCAA tournament fate would be determined in the single-elimination Pac-12 conference tournament.
But for the second time in as many games, the Trojan (14-17, 9-9 Pac-12) came up short. They were thrashed 76-51 by the second-worst team in the Pac-12 conference. Sure, the Cougars (13-18, 4-14) were fresh off an impressive win over the Pac-12 regular-season champion UCLA Bruins, but still, that wasn’t an excuse for the lackadaisical performance USC put on. It was easily one of the worst losses of the season.
The Cougars amassed a 6-0 lead and never looked back. There were backdoor cuts, hard screens and a flurry of crisp passes, each dissecting the Trojans’ defense bit by bit. The Trojans were forced to deploy a 2-3 zone at about the 10 mark of the first half. It worked at first, but then the Cougars figured out where the gaps were and the embarrassment continued. Washington State only turned the ball over five times.
The game was all but over at halftime, with the Cougars enjoying a 39-20 lead. USC shot just 28.8 percent in the first half, continuing its struggles from the Washington game. For the game, the Trojans weren’t much better, shooting 33.9 percent. Their 3-point shooting deserted them — USC shot just 4-of-24 for the night, or an anemic 16.7 percent. And once again, the Trojans were dominated on the glass, 45-34, routinely giving the Cougars multiple shot attempts on a possession.
One of the beneficiaries was Cougar senior forward Brock Motum, who slithered his 6-foot-10 frame around Trojan defenders en route to a season-best 31 points on 11-of-22 shooting. In the first half alone, Motum scored more points (21) than the Trojans themselves did (20).
But Motum did more than score. He kept possessions alive with his three offensive rebounds and 10 rebounds overall. He had two blocks and two steals. He wanted this game on his senior day more than USC did, and his effort and intensity showed as much.
“We couldn’t stop Motum,” USC interim head coach Bob Cantu said. “He had 21 at halftime. That was a big problem. We kept coming back between man and zone to try to find a way to guard him, and we struggled defensively, got down in a hole and weren’t able to make a shot.”
Cougar redshirt sophomore Royce Woolridge chipped in 25 points, including three 3-pointers in a row in the second half to permanently separate the Cougars from the Trojans.
There were a couple of bright spots for the Trojans, though.
Junior guard J.T. Terrell had 18 points on 7-of-15 shooting, and he did more than his fair share to lead USC from down 19 at halftime to down five with 13:43 remaining. Senior guard Jio Fontan, playing through a right-hand injury, had nine points and six assists.
Meanwhile, the Trojans’ 18-4 run was arguably the best stretch of basketball by either team, but it was short lived, making way for the Cougars’ eventual run to seal the game.
“I was happy with our fight in the second half to get down to five,” Cantu said. “We kind of used so much energy to get out of that hole that we weren’t able to get over the top.”
USC will head into the Pac-12 conference tournament as the seventh seed, set to face the 10-seed Utah Utes at 6 p.m. on Wednesday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Trojans defeated the Utes 76-59 in their lone meeting in Utah, but if their last two games are any indication, they can’t afford to overlook any opponent. If the Trojans defeat the Utes, a second-round matchup with the Cal Golden Bears awaits them.
Things definitely did not go as planned in the state of Washington. The Trojans left with two losses in two winnable games. They shot 35.7 percent for the trip, a free-flowing offense gone cold and stagnant. Any momentum they had mustered after their sweep of the Arizona schools is gone. But it’s how they respond that will determine how they are remembered.
“We’ve had some tough losses and we’ve rebounded and we’ve had some huge wins,” Cantu said. “We’ve got to adjust and we’ve got to be ready to go on Wednesday.”

The No. 3-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team split its season opener in the first-ever competition at the brand-new Merle Norman Stadium Sunday afternoon in front of a large home crowd. The Women of Troy (1-1) defeated Loyola Marymount 4-1 and narrowly lost to No. 4 Florida State 3-2.
Grand opening · Junior Sam Hirschmann (right) and freshman Sydney Seau (No. 21) fell in close contests to LMU (21-18, 21-19), and also to Florida State (21-19, 21-19). USC still defeated LMU 4-1. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy opened up the day on a good note by soundly defeating LMU (0-2). USC got off to a good start with the USC pair of junior Brooke Fournier and senior Natasha Siljkovic defeating the Lions’ Ashley Maxfedlt and Taylor Sciocsia in straight sets, 21-13, 21-9. However, LMU would answer the Trojans when Amber Mirabello and Hannah Tedrow swept the USC pair of junior Sam Hirschmann and freshman Sydney Seau 21-18, 21-19.
With the match tied at 1-1, the USC’s second-best pair of senior Katie Fuller and graduate student Stevi Robinson came out to sweep the LMU pair of Rachelle Suaava and Anne Marie Taylor 21-15, 21-12 to give the Women of Troy a 2-1 lead that they would not give back.
The dual was clinched by USC with sophomores Eve Ettinger and Alexa Stonish defeating Avery Bush and Litara Keli in straight sets 21-15, 21-12.
USC’s top-ranked pair of junior Kirby Burnham and sophomore Bria Russ would then put the icing on the cake with a come-from-behind, three-set win over Felicia Arriola and Kenna Crouse, 18-21, 21-15, 15-11, to give the Women of Troy their first win in the new stadium.
“That first win was important because I thought that it instilled a sense of confidence in our team, and it was a relief to get that first win under our belt,” Robinson said.
In the second match of the doubleheader, USC took on No. 4-ranked Florida State but would struggle to find its groove early, which ultimately proved costly.
“I felt we played okay and thought we were a little more nervous than I thought we would be with the whole ambiance of the new stadium — the band, the crowd and not to mention an experienced Florida State team that beat us last year as well,” head coach Anna Collier said.
USC’s fourth- and fifth-ranked pairs opened up the dual with losses in straight sets, although they were close throughout. The No. 5-ranked pair of Hirschmann and Seau narrowly lost to the Florida State pair of Kristina and Stephanie Pelliterri, 21-19, 21-19.
“We competed in every game against Florida State,” Collier said. “The overall match is really only a difference in four points, which is really good for us with the limited experience that we have.”
The Seminoles (2-0) clinched victory by sweeping the pair of Ettinger and Stonish 21-17, 21-10.
Even with the match already decided, USC fought back with the top-ranked pair of Burnham and Russ, sweeping its match against the Seminoles. The second-ranked pair of Fuller and Robinson also won its match in a three-set thriller 21-16, 18-21, 15-12.
“Obviously, we would have liked to come out with the overall win, but for being a new team and only a few of us having experience from last year, I thought we did pretty well,” Robinson said.
In just its second season, the team is already making large strides toward becoming one of the top squads in the country and is currently ranked No. 3. It finished 7-4 last year in its inaugural season. However, experience remains the main issue for the Women of Troy.
“We don’t have a lot of beach experience, and these girls are just coming from an indoor program so we don’t have a lot of competitions under our belt,” Collier said. “So bottom line, the best thing for us moving forward is experience.”
Senior Natasa Siljkovic of Serbia, who just wrapped up her three-year career as a middle blocker for USC’s indoor team, played her first-ever match of competitive volleyball on the sand Sunday.
“For me, this is a whole new experience and a whole different game, but I am really excited to be a part of this team,” Siljkovic said.
USC will look to gain more experience on the beach circuit as it participates in another three-team dual against CSU Bakersfield and Grand Canyon University at Merle Norman Stadium on Thursday, March 14. First serve is set for 1 p.m.

USC Concerts Committee’s Springfest and the Black Student Assembly’s Gearfest, two annual festivals known for their artistic flair, will be held together on April 6 to save overall costs for both events.

The two events, funded through Program Board’s student-programming fees and sponsorships, traditionally have been held separately in McCarthy Quad. Last semester, the Concerts Committee and the BSA began planning the event in conjunction.
“It’s all about being able to execute the show in the best way possible without having a huge budget,” said Lamar Gary, the executive director of BSA.
Gary said that if the two events were held separately, each organization would have to pay the full price for their event.
The executive director of Concerts Committee Bryan Leong said the university’s new security policies factored into the combination of the two festivals. The administration now requires attendees to a university-sponsored event to present USC identification and security is necessary at events that last after 9 p.m.
“The price of security is at least 30-40 percent higher than usual,” Leong said. “We have to pay for the security — such as DPS and CSC officers, fencing and barricades — and the cost of tearing down the stage the day after.”
Leong said that in past years, Concerts Committee could have the stage struck down the same night after the festival. Yet the implementation of the university’s stricter security policies have made that more difficult.
Though recognizing that security did increase the cost of the event, Gary does not attribute the consolidation of both festivals to the new security policies.
“Both agreed that we want each show to have its own identity while bringing a festival vibe to USC,” Gary said.
Leong said the collaboration had financial benefits as well.
“We definitely would love to see more collaboration,” Leong said. “It would help out because production costs would be cheaper.”
Springfest is a free all-day music festival open to students, faculty and staff. Gearfest is a fashion show created to promote new designers and features student and professional models, according to BSA’s website.
Both events will still retain their original names. Program Board, however, is marketing the event with Gearfest as a component of Springfest, Leong said.
Leong believes the collaboration will be beneficial to both organizations and will enhance the overall event.
“By sharing stages and production costs, we can attract a much better day attendance, which we haven’t gotten in past years,” Leong said. “In the same way, we can take Gearfest to the next level and can get them a much bigger headliner.”
Some students said this combination shows that Concerts Committee and BSA are being financially conscious.
“With the increase in security, it’s understandable that they would schedule them both together to save money,” said Myles Nuzzi, a freshman majoring in vocal jazz. “I’m happy that the Program Board is doing its best to use its budget efficiently.”
Nuzzi also said that scheduling both events together would add to, rather than detract from, each event.
“It’s going to be exciting to see them both come together,” Nuzzi said. “For people that are too busy to attend both events, this will give them a chance to experience them both at the same time.”
Other students also said the combination will make more students aware of Gearfest.
“I personally am not familiar with Gearfest, so although I’m sure there are many other USC students who are familiar with it, it will bring a lot more awareness to that event,” said Shelby DeWeese, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies and creative writing.
Sam Couch, a junior majoring in computer science, agrees.
“I don’t think Gearfest has had much promotion in the past, so combining with Springfest will help get the word out and get better acts for everyone to enjoy rather than two separate events,” Couch said.
Leong said the lineup will be announced March 29. Past festivals have had Wolfgang Gartner, Mos Def and Blink-182 as headliners.
Both Leong and Gary believe combining these two festivals in the future would be beneficial, but Gary noted it is not a definite arrangement.
“I would say that it really depends on the direction of new leadership,” Gary said. “If they feel like they want it and like the type of show we put together, they may want to keep it combined.”

Members of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity expressed excitement over the signing of the lease of their new house at 624 W. 28th Street on The Row.
New home · Sigma Alpha Mu, which is currently located on the corner of Royal and West 32nd streets, will move to The Row in fall 2013. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The house was previously occupied by the brothers of Beta Omega Phi, an Asian-interest fraternity which is not affiliated with the Interfraternity Council.
In early October 2012, Sigma Alpha Mu began communicating with the landlord of the property, who had recently changed the terms of his lease with Beta Omega Phi.
Sigma Alpha Mu Housing Manager Justin Elliot said that though other fraternities and sororities were interested in the house, the landlord was interested in a long-term tenant.
“We had heard that the landlord was entertaining new tenant proposals, so we kept in close contact with him,” Elliott said.
Sigma Alpha Mu President Sam Canter said that a long-term commitment was just what the fraternity wanted to make. Since regaining its charter in 2007, Canter said the house has seen tremendous growth in membership, which has tripled in size in the past few years.
“When you’re at 91 guys, you need a bigger facility to go along with that,” Canter said. “Living on The Row is the next step in that growth.”
The new house and the attached apartment complex in the back has space for 54 live-in members, which is triple the capacity of the fraternity’s current house on the intersection of Royal and 32nd Streets. With more live-in space, many more actives have the opportunity to play a greater role in Sigma Alpha Mu, with 54 actives already committed to living in the house for the 2013-14 academic year.
Fraternity brother Louis Blacker, a freshman majoring in business administration who will be living in the new house next year, said moving onto The Row will bring his fraternity closer to the other fraternities in the Interfraternity Council.
“We are obviously excited to join the rest of the Greek community on The Row,” Blacker said. “The guys are just excited to live in all one house together. It’s going to be 54 guys compared to 18 in the old house, so it’s just more exciting.”
Canter said the fraternity hopes the move will allow Sigma Alpha Mu to also expand its campus presence.
“I think this is a great thing for us,” Canter said. “We are hoping to enlarge our social scene and our brotherhood and make a lasting name for ourselves at USC.”
Interfraternity Council President Ofek Lavian said he is pleased to welcome another member fraternity onto The Row.
“We are ecstatic that Sigma Alpha Mu is coming to The Row,” Lavian said. “It’s an exciting time for them as they move onto The Row and become part of the premier Greek experience.”
Though moving to The Row comes with many social implications and opportunities, Canter said he is confident that the fraternity will be able to maintain its identity.
“If we are recruiting guys who are a lot like us and who have the same outlook on life as us, then our house is going to be able to stay the same,” Canter said.
Canter said that though the relocation will mean an increase in the fraternity’s live-in dues from approximately $1000 to $1,300 per semester, Sigma Alpha Mu will maintain its commitment to being affordable. Canter said the live-out dues will be approximately $400.
“Our live-out fees are going to go up in order to pay for the higher price of rent,” Canter said. “We had to keep live-in prices low to create an incentive for the guys who are living in the house. Plus, living on The Row comes with doing more events and philanthropies, which is also going to cost more. We’ve done a good job of keeping our dues lower than other fraternities but still being able to do a lot with that budget.”
Sigma Alpha Mu’s current house, which it has occupied since 2009, is owned by USC Housing. The brothers will be moving into the new house over summer 2013.
Who is the landlord?  I thought the school (or one of its foundations) owned all of the houses on the Row.
It’s owned by Hollywood or banker types.   I think they are Jewish
Where will the 24hr BOP pharmacist go?
Congrats to the brothers of Sigma Alpha Mu. Best wishes for your continued success as you enter this new phase in the life of Mu Theta Chapter. Enjoy the view from your cat-bird seat at the top of the Row.

The Viterbi School of Engineering was named a top-10 graduate engineering school by a 2014 U.S. News and World Report preview released Thursday, March 7.
The preview, which reviewed 199 schools granting doctoral degrees, listed the top 10 schools in alphabetical order. USC shares the top-10 honor with several other California schools, including rivals UC Berkeley, Stanford and the California Institute of Technology.
In the 2013 U.S. News and World Report graduate school rankings, Viterbi was ranked 12 among 198 schools surveyed. Schools are ranked based on a number of factors including student selectivity, level of research and peer and recruiter evaluations.
Viterbi representatives declined to comment until Tuesday, when the full rankings are officially released.
Jay Singh, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said that the rankings didn’t change his perception of the school, which has been prestigious for some time.
“Viterbi was highly ranked even before this release,” Singh said. “It’s always been a phenomenal school, and it will continue to be.”
Wang said he was proud of the high ranking of his school.
“I thought it was exciting that a school I’m attending has moved into such a prestigious position,” said Eric Wang, a freshman majoring in computer science.
Chen said he is considering applying to Viterbi’s progressive degree program, which allows undergraduate students to earn both a bachelor and a master’s degree in five years.
“I think Viterbi’s graduate program is stronger than its undergraduate, which is also great,” Jacky Chen said. “Viterbi’s ranking was definitely a factor in my decision to apply for this program.”
the main reason the MBA program dropped is probably because they had a BAD year for employment.  about one fourth of the class did NOT get a job 3 months after graduation.  the main reason for that was because they were hiring new staff and so who help students get jobs.  students were sort of left on their own for a little while.
looks like USC MBA program got killed though.. out of top 25
Yup, the business school rankings are an issue, the MBA especially.  This is where, unfortunately, USC has to be evaluated on a school by school basis.  It’s frustrating given that Leventhal is very highly ranked.
I heard that b-school rankings are “self reported.” There isn’t a real, objective way to evaluate them, and hence I take them with a grain of salt…Oh, how ’bout this? Let’s see how successful b-school grads are after they graduate, with perhaps a study 5 years down the road. Let’s see how wealthy they become with all the tools they acquired in these “schools of capitalism.”
The title of this article is not completely accurate. Based on the US News preview, USC Viterbi is top 10, not necessarily number 10. We will find out when the rankings are actually released. USC might be #10.  Or higher!?!

USC’s decision to host a Visions and Voices panel Thursday on queer television just goes to show that more people today are discussing queer characters and their impact on television.
Over the past 50 years, television has taken large strides to portray more LGBTQ characters. But though queer television is no longer a niche topic, the question remains: Has television done its job in facilitating acceptance of gay culture?
Back in 1922, TV networks danced around homosexuality, as it was perceived to be a sensitive subject. In fact, the Hays Code required industry-internal review of all film scripts, primarily as an acceptable substitute for government censorship.
According to the panel, the first gay character on television came in 1959 in the form of Snagglepuss (then called Snaggletooth). Snagglepuss, who appeared on The Yogi Bear Show, took the form of a flamboyantly pink anthropomorphic mountain lion best known for his catchphrases like “Exit, stage left!” Still, no matter how pink or glitzy Snagglepuss was, his character’s sexual orientation or romantic preference was never explored on TV.
Boy, how times have changed.
Snagglepuss is no more. Not only are LGBTQ individuals portrayed on television without any pretenses, they have real, honest storylines — struggling with problems from the serious to the petty, along with searching for love, whether the person who holds their eyes is a man or a woman.
Modern television writers have clearly attempted to portray a different type of gay character: a character that is an individual with his or her own quirks that cannot be summed up in any one word or one stereotype.
Take Glee, for example. The show has had a massive effect on depicting homosexuality in today’s media. Glee broke ground by showing openly gay romances and taking on the subject of teen bullying. The romance between Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) is not just about them being gay in today’s world. Instead, like any struggling relationship, they deal with problems such as monogamy and long-distance relationships.
The show does not only focus on the news that these kids are gay and are struggling with their sexuality — rather, on Glee, the news is that Kurt is in New York and Blaine is still in Lima, Ohio, and the once in-love couple is trying to overcome the impossible difficulties of being apart and dealing with romantic temptations.
At Thursday’s panel, executive producer of The New Normal Allison Adler said it best when she stated that, “there’s a stereotype in invoking the stereotype.” Adler’s show focuses on parenting from the point of a single mother surrogate, a cranky grandmother and two gay men who want to have a baby. The bottom line, Adler said, is that the show is about parenting — and parenting isn’t about sexuality. It’s when that concept does not have to be cleared up — that parenting is parenting no matter the sexuality of the parents — that society’s progress will truly be evident.
Still, though television seems to be progressing to a point where LGBTQ characters can be themselves without any preconceptions, we have not reached that point yet. One only needs to look as far as a controversial article in Newsweek where writer Ramin Setoodeh attacked gay actors that play straight characters to see that there are still misconceptions about queer characters.
Setoodeh wrote that these actors and actresses are simply not convincing as straight men, failing to realize that actors do not play a “sexual identity” but rather the gray lines that make up a character. As shows, such as Glee and The New Normal, have set out to prove, no one person is a simply flamboyant “girly man” or a simply athletic and tough “manly man.” Each character is an individual and thus consists of many distinct traits.
At the end of the day, individuals are all human and are just trying to find their path in life like everyone else. Their identities might not always be clear. But isn’t that what it’s all about? That there is no one stereotype?
Instead of trying to fit an artificial stereotype, these characters are simply real individuals dealing with real problems on a day-to-day basis.
We, as viewers, should embrace that. For now, though, there is something to be said for how television has come a long way since Snagglepuss.

If you could sum up the feel of Rhye’s seductive, slinking debut album, singer Mike Milosh’s opening lines on the single “The Fall” might be a good place to start. “Oh, make love to me,” he croons, his whispery vocals crescendoing as piano chords plink away in the background.

Not that we should pigeonhole or anything, by the way. Woman is Rhye’s debut album, and the duo — composed of producer Robin Hannibal (of electronic duo Quadron) and producer/vocalist Milosh — has created not just a mix of songs perfect for intimate nights but a soulful record full of creative compositions and contemplative lyricism. It’s the kind of album that steals your breath when you least expect it, and before you know it, Woman’s mysteriously swooping strings and electronic foreplay buries deep into the heart.
There’s an enigmatic air to Woman, one that pervades not just the arrangements but also the real-world background of the duo. Search the web for how Rhye came to be — there’s hardly any information to be found. The liner notes don’t reveal much about how the album came to be, either. For all intents and purposes, it appears that the duo appeared out of thin air.
In that vein, the album holds many happy surprises, perhaps the biggest of all being Milosh’s lovely countertenor voice. You might assume that a woman is singing, and that wouldn’t be much of a misstep; Milosh’s vocals sound a bit androgynous on many of Woman’s tracks, but they work to add another layer of sexy intrigue to the record.
Many critics have compared Milosh’s voice to that of British singer-songwriter Sade, which is a pretty solid assessment — both reach deep into R&B and soul roots while leaving out any ostentatious vocal gymnastics. But Milosh can, at times, sound like anyone from Joni Mitchell  on “A Case of You” to the xx’s bluntly sweet Romy Madley Croft. It’s a voice that melds remarkably well with the minimal production of Woman’s tracks.
Whereas many electronic compositions feature dense, sophisticated instrumentation, Milosh and Hannibal choose to strip away the fussy bits, leaving behind a sleek blend of keyboards, strings, jazzy percussion and electronic accents. Take album opener “Open,” for one: A softly thudding bass drum and finger snaps drive the beat as Milosh sings, “I’m a fool for that shake in your thighs / I’m a fool for that sound in your sighs.” Then, the chorus arrives: “I want to make this play — oh, I know you’re faded / Hmm, but stay — don’t close your hands,” he sings as lilting horns and strings jump in to play.
These compositions can feel both intensely fresh and a bit like deja vu, which overall makes for some serious aural comfort food. “Shed Some Blood” features fleeting tinges of Marvin Gaye’s classic “Sexual Healing,” while “One of Those Summer Days” strolls into the warm realm of indie dream-pop. Going beyond the bedroom-music label, one could call Woman the perfect comedown album, the sort of record you play the morning after while stretching out sore muscles and shaking away the mental cobwebs.
But that’s not to say Woman is just sensual and mellow; some of Rhye’s best moments come when the duo picks up the pace. “Hunger” and “Last Dance” both display some deliciously sharp funk influences that’ll get heads bobbing in seconds, and “3 Days” reps hypnotic four-on-the-floor drums that will probably inspire a bit of dancing. The biggest flaw of the album, in fact, is that the slowest tracks can feel draggy in comparison; “Major Minor Love” and the title track, for example, present ethereal soundtracks that you might love or hate depending on the mood.
A second complaint? Woman’s run time. The album clocks in at about 36 minutes, and its 10 tracks go by in a flash. Perhaps it’s not such a terrible thing for a record to leave a craving for more, but some listens can feel alarmingly short, especially if the album’s left on as background music.
But that just leaves greater anticipation for more music from Rhye, and the attention the duo has received leaves them with the tall task of crafting an equally quality follow-up. For now, Woman stands as a remarkable achievement in blending old and new to form a tightly produced treatise on romance, both of the heart and of the flesh.
“Make love to me,” indeed.

Big movies released early in the year have a bit of a bad reputation.
The blockbusters expected to make more money are usually held back until the summer, when audiences have more free time. Meanwhile, the movies that are expected to fare better during the awards season are nudged closer to the end of the year to be fresh in the voters’ minds.
Strangers on a train · Colin Farrell (left) and Noomi Rapace (right) play two strangers who are brought together through their mutual desire for revenge against Alphonse, the corrupt ringleader of a crime empire. – Photo courtesy of FilmDistrict Publicity
It makes sense on both fronts, but it leaves us sifting for something digestible with offerings such as Die Hard 5 and The Last Exorcism Part II the only options at this time of year. As entertaining as watching an almost 60-year-old John McClane shoot a series of anonymous Russians for two hours can be, it’s nice that movies such as Dead Man Down can sneak in and provide some salvation.
Dead Man Down is a deliciously dark thriller, focusing on the ideas of revenge and the desire to change the past. This is Niels Arden Oplev’s first American film. Oplev, who created Sweden’s masterful Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, delivers on the same dark and mysterious notes he so effectively played in the Tattoo series. His three stars are wonderful in their journey through this darkness, and they carry the movie.
Using the old Philip Marlowe mold for film noir leading men, Colin Farrell’s Victor is a compelling and quietly dangerous leading man. His performance is intensely quiet, which, like Ryan Gosling’s in Drive two years ago, lends an uneasy danger to his character.
Farrell found a bit of a sweet spot the last few years playing manic, fast-talking characters in Horrible Bosses, Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges, three scene-stealing performances. Here, taking his performance to the other end of the spectrum, he still shines. Victor, like every other character in the film, is haunted by his past. He works as a killer for the mob while pursuing his own revenge on the side. Farrell delivers this conflict through gestures and body language. It’s very well done by a prominent yet underappreciated actor.
Now, there is the question of the villain, a role in which audiences are definitely not used to seeing Terrence Howard. Seeing Howard as a mob boss takes a little getting used to, but in hindsight it makes you wonder why he hasn’t played more villains.
Howard’s Alphonse is a smooth and calculating adversary. His hair is almost as slick as his talk, and you can tell Howard is loving this darker role. Alphonse has to deal with someone targeting his organization for something it did in the past. His paranoia at being pursued and taunted with cryptic messages is played perfectly, with his smoothness cracking into rage at just the right beats.
Finally, what noirish thriller would be complete without a mysterious and dangerous woman to accompany the hero? Noomi Rapace, Oplev’s heroine from Tattoo, plays Beatrice, a woman that comes into Victor’s life seeking her own revenge for a drunk driving accident that left her face scarred.
Victor and Beatrice’s romance is central to the movie, running parallel to the themes of revenge and redemption. Rapace’s performance is explosive next to Farrell’s slow burn, and their chemistry is obvious. Though it is hard to choose between the three stellar performances, Beatrice’s magnetic fragility sets her apart and might just be the highlight of the film.
The film has undeniable dark undertones. The characters are all damaged people and revenge is a messy business. It would have been easy to make this film very bleak, but Oblev shows that his mastery of noir undertones translates just fine from Swedish. He creates a beautiful world for his players to live in, and he takes advantage of the setting to further his aesthetic. Moments like when Beatrice and Victor wave to each other from opposite apartment building balconies are truly breathtaking. It would be difficult to call a movie that is this violent and troubled uplifting, but it is definitely hopeful. Amid their darkness and their pain, the characters find hope, and ultimately the movie is beautiful because of it.
Dead Man Down has a bit of everything. It has multiple action scenes, a compelling romance, camaraderie, comedy and large dashes of darkness. The three main actors command attention with their wonderful roles, and the setting the director creates truly captures the emotion of the story. It’s a heavy film, but not so much so, hitting a wide variety of notes before coming to a close.
In short, Dead Man Down is just the kind of movie to break audiences out of the early-year movie doldrums.

Sometime last week, I was walking across campus and talking with a friend about Los Angeles. The talk was engaging, but at one point he mentioned that he does not believe Los Angeles to be a particularly segregated city. His case is rooted in the fact that the city’s diversity is remarkable in terms of pure demographics and that while walking through parts of the city, he sees diversity unlike what he has seen in his native northeastern Boston.
I disagree. I believe that Los Angeles is an extraordinarily segregated city. This is not to say that diverse and fully integrated parts of Los Angeles don’t exist, for there are many. But to argue that Los Angeles is a fully integrated city is to overlook several large swaths — the majority, really — of the city.
Most people who know Los Angeles can give you a breakdown of how ethnicities seem to be scattered about the city: Eastside equates to Latinos, the Westside is white, South Los Angeles is largely black, and the Valley is a divided mix between Latino and white people.
We are aware of this, but most of us living in Los Angeles (especially those reading this) don’t experience it because we never have a need to travel outside of our designated “racial zone.”
This applies to me just as much as it can to anyone else. When school is not in session, I spend most of my time in the Valley and Westside. I also occasionally travel to East Los Angeles, most often to visit members of my paternal family who are of Mexican heritage.
I’ve never really had any reason to travel into South Los Angeles, however. Indeed, prior to this semester, I could count the number of times I’ve traveled south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard on one hand.
This semester, however, I started field work for a local campaign. The office I work out of is located just north of the intersection of Crenshaw and Slauson boulevards, an area about three and a half miles southwest of USC in a census tract that is 89 percent black.
The nature of campaign field work demands that I work not in an office but outside interacting with people who live in South Los Angeles. I can easily say that doing this field work has made me realize how South Los Angeles is just as varied as any other part of Los Angeles.
The stereotype of South Los Angeles being a poverty and crime-ridden region is true in some neighborhoods, but other neighborhoods are just plain beautiful. Indeed, there are several primarily black communities in South Los Angeles that are extraordinarily affluent. The notable example is Ladera Heights, a neighborhood that breaks down to being 65 percent black and posting a median income of over $118,000.
By this, the median income places Ladera Heights into similar levels of affluence as Pacific Palisades ($158,000) or Malibu ($133,000).
Nevertheless, in the same Ladera Heights is nearly 90 percent black, the Palisades and Malibu are also nearly 90 percent white. Despite relative economic equality, affluent white people and affluent black people do not mix.
Exactly why there is no mixing, I cannot understand. On paper, individuals from these neighborhoods reflect wealth, college education, civic engagement and cultural participation. The curious bit comes when one notes how the only characteristic that varies between the inhabitants of these neighborhoods is race.
A New York Times op-ed piece by Ta-Nehisi Coates entitled “The Good, Racist People” makes the case that “the idea that racism lives in the heart of particularly evil individuals, as opposed to the heart of a democratic society, is reinforcing.”
Coates would likely agree with the sentiment that ignoring Los Angeles’ racial segregation is a reflection of how racism is most often treated as an isolated example instead of an institutional norm.
There is little doubt that the United States, since its genesis, has made tremendous strides in racial inclusion. Yet the fact of the matter remains that there are still racial barriers to overcome, and it is too early to declare a victory in the fight against racial prejudice and segregation.
I have no doubt that it will come in the future, but the inevitability of racial equality can only remain inevitable if we continue to fight for it today.

Very interesting observations which mostly reflect my own. When I first came to Los Angeles to attend USC, I lived with my Aunt in Compton. Then primarily black, the neighborhoods had manicured lawns with homeowners that cared. As I would take the bus north, the ridership would change to More Latino ad then if I continued past USC  to Hollywood it would become Asian, then White. It never ceased to amaze me. And you’re right. There were a few opportunities to mix across the lines, although in various households you would have interracial couples which often had to choose which side of the family they would live near.  
But, I do not know how you could write that you do not understand why. Some of it came from forced segregation. The predominantly Black neighborhoods of Leimert Park, Windsor Hills, Baldwin Hills, View Park and even Compton and Inglewood may be Black now, but once had covenants that the white only neighborhoods could not sell to Blacks, and the only Blacks could live there were servants. Even Lakers great James Worthy tried to buy in a West L. A. Westchester type neighborhood and the residents moved to block the sale. Our beloved Hall of Famer James Worthy!!
Some of it is birds of a feather flocking together, and economics. Blacks have been noticing Eastern Europeans and Latinos buying up vacant property and you know what that means:”there goes the neighborhood!”
Keep writing what you observe. I enjoyed this piece.

What is more innocent and idyllic than a public park? The idea of one, however, has taken a dark turn. Instead of existing for the sake of fun and perhaps a bit of fresh air, small “pocket” parks have opened up across the country in order to drive out sex offenders, according to the Denver Post.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Jessica’s Law states that sex offenders cannot live within 2,000 feet of a school or public park, according to the Post. And thanks to the rising number of sex offenders living in the Harbor Gateway here in Los Angeles — where parents say that they routinely see paroled convicts wearing GPS ankle bracelets — neighborhoods have been opening up small parks wherever they can.
Officials view the parks as tools to change the resident makeup of surrounding areas and call the strategy “a novel way to move out offenders while providing more recreation space,” according to the L.A. Times.
The creation of pocket parks is only a topical fix, however, and it fails to solve the problem of sex offenses. Instead of using pocket parks to further marginalize registered sex offenders, California should focus on rehabilitation programs.
Though various restrictions make the  number of sex offenders in Los Angeles lower than the state average, certain areas have much higher concentrations of offenders. For example, the area around Torrance only has 767 residents per registered sex offender, while the city of Los Angeles has 1,174 residents per every sex offender. These densely populated areas, dubbed “pervert rows” by local residents, result from California’s Jessica’s Law. These strict residency restrictions push many sex offenders either to become transient or to settle in highly concentrated areas. According to USA Today, California has over 2,000 sex offenders without permanent addresses. Not only does this make them harder to track, but they might also be more likely to commit another crime, according to Jill Levenson, a sex-crimes policy analyst.
Yet, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation plans to strengthen laws that punish sex offenders rather than focusing on rehabilitation and treatment programs. Though California prisons offer educational and vocational programs, this is not enough to prevent sex crimes. The CDCR notes on its website that “of the almost 92,000 sex offenders statewide, [it] is only responsible for a little more than 11 [percent] (10,781).”
It hopes to change this statistic, however, by enforcing Jessica’s Law and Megan’s Law, which dictates that offenders must register with the state department. Other forms of monitoring include CDCR-enforced GPS tracking more than 7,000 sex offenders. Yet, as USA Today writes, “The people you need to be worried about most are the ones who aren’t registering at all.”
Instead of expending effort to displace registered sex offenders, the state needs to address the problem of transient and repeat offenders. Though California is willing to put $6 million toward the creation of small pocket parks, it does not fund sex offender treatment programs in its prisons. Even though data from the CDCR shows that only about 2 percent of convicted sex offenders are sent back to prison on a new sex-abuse offense, considering the 92,000 offenders in California, this number is appreciable. In fact, the California Sex Offender Registry lists 16,671 residents as “in violation,” a statistic that needs to be addressed through reform and rehabilitation programs. Money should be channeled toward preventing repeat offenses rather than creating pocket parks to drive sex offenders away.
Despite the stigma attached to sex offenders, progress is being made on their behalf. Organizations, such as the California Reform Sex Offenders Laws Organization advocate for the “constitutional rights for all citizens.”
They fight an uphill battle, however. According to RSOL President Janice Bellucci, hysteria clouds public perception and obscures the facts. RSOL promotes treatment programs as a solution to decreasing sex crimes. Findings by the Canadian Psychological Association support their efforts: treated sex offenders are 10 percent less likely to repeat their crimes than those who do not receive treatment.
Neither stricter laws nor pocket parks will solve the underlying problem of sex offenses. Like Band-Aids, these measures only represent topical fixes. Instead, the state needs to address the root of the problem with in-prison rehabilitation and treatment programs.

I think everyone has a great point! Joe Friday sounds like a pretty big idiot! ALthough, he obviously has no educational background and is both making pointless and baseless comments. Its rather disturbing to see people make silly/stupid comments like this. The article was well written and makes total sense!
I’m all for rehabilitating sex offenders on the public’s dime as long as they are castrated first.
A group that goes completely forgotten, yet deeply affected in these matters is the children of registered sex offenders.
When these pocket parks and measures such as Jessica’s Law are enacted, some families are forced to move or split up and at no small cost.
Many registered sex offender’s crimes are 30+ years old and they have been faithfully registering while leading productive lives. Until the Megan’s Law became public they were anonymous, law abiding citizens who had served their time and moved on to build careers, families, etc. But that all changed when their names and addresses were published for all to see. No thought was given to the kids of the registrants who would face public humiliation and start paying for the sins of their fathers.
Imagine the 5 year old girl who has no friends in kindergarten. Parents of her classmates told their children to stay away from the girl with the bad daddy. She has no birthday parties or play dates. She is alone in the sand box, very sad, unable to understand why she has no friends.
Despite his 30 year old conviction, her father developed a successful career as a professional in a service industry. But he lost his job when the Meagan’s Law site launched and has had trouble finding work since.
Their income half what is was, the mother now does the work of a single mom, ferrying the kids to and from school while trying to stay anonymous herself in other areas of life. She uses her maiden name in her career and limits personal relationships.
The father is forbidden from school functions, even though his crime did not involve a child and was non-violent. He cannot attend the Christmas show and see his little girl sing, or join in the PTA conference. The little girl asks him regularly why he never takes her to school, or why he did not come and see her in the play.
He struggles to answer in ways that will make her feel better.
What damage is being done to these forgotten children? What good does it do to force them to pay for the sins of their parents? What will be the final cost when we expect these children to grow up and be productive members of our society?
There isn’t a way to “like” these comments, but Like, Like, Like!
This is so beautifully written and articulated. Blessings to you and your family. You might enjoy reading this article: http://www.corrections.com/news/article/30787-if-it-saves-one-child
Yes, CA and all states need to address the issue of registrants with meaningful rehabilitation programs. They need even more desperately to address the far larger issue of child sexual abuse by addressing its root cause, which is not found by looking at sex offender registries but rather by looking at individuals in the lives of the children being molested. Sexual crime against children is committed by family members, peers, and authority figures. Less than 1% of it, according to the FBI, is attributable to someone already on the registry. And since those responsible have not been identified, a comprehensive education and prevention program is essential, and it must start now. It won’t happen overnight, but the current system has had twenty years and hasn’t and will never address the actual problem. We must re-align our priorities and our resources. Punishing after the fact does nothing for the victims of today and tomorrow.
I agree that the efforts should shift from punishment to help. Sex offenders don’t want to have the desires that they have. In fact, they want more than anything to not have the desires. Help them. And if you’re true goal is to help children, then help the sex offenders. If you keep punishing them, they will not have the will to move on with their lives in a positive manner. The more you whip them, they will be locked into the darkness, and will be more likely to re-offend.
And for others out there who have the same desires, give them a means of getting help. Why not prevent future offenses instead of waiting until they occur and then punishing?
We need a park on the Row so we can close it down as well!
