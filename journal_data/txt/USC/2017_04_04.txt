Known as “Tailback U,” USC football has boasted a history of developing talented running backs. With players such as Mike Garrett, O. J. Simpson, Charles White and — more recently — Reggie Bush and LenDale White donning the Cardinal and Gold, USC has long been a destination for running backs looking for success in college and beyond.
While the Trojans have retained almost the entirety of their coaching staff from the 2016 season, the new face at Howard Jones Field is running backs coach Deland McCullough. After serving as the running backs coach at Indiana University from 2011 to 2016, McCullough now has his turn to shape the next generation of “Tailback U.” 
McCullough replaces former running backs coach Tommie Robinson, who left USC to take a position under former football interim head coach Ed Orgeron at LSU. Replacing Robinson, a man who had NFL coaching experience, was a tall order for head coach Clay Helton and offensive coordinator Tee Martin. In their search for Robinson’s replacement, the Trojan coaching staff was looking for a handful of traits: a proven track record, character that aligned with the ideals of the program, a savvy Xs and Os guy and an effective recruiter.
McCullough fit the bill, and the new coach recalled his pitch to Helton and the Trojan staff before the start of spring football.
“I stressed to them the small things, whether it be our linemen, reads on runs, footwork [or] hand placement,” McCullough said. “I’m just a detail freak.”
That attention to detail has allowed McCullough to analyze the nuances of his job.
“One thing I think is overlooked as a running backs coach is that our job is a big job,” McCullough said. “It isn’t just handing the ball off to the guy that’s doing it. You’ve got to give him reads and angles to take. I try to be a great student of the game, and then I turn around and try to be a great teacher, too.” 
With no previous connections or ties to USC, McCullough’s hire was relatively out of the blue.
“He was recommended to us by a couple people both in the pro ranks and in college that we know,” Helton said. “We started doing our research on him, and you looked at a guy that was a great evaluator of talent. But even more important was how he developed talent. We really thought we had a gem, a diamond in the rough.”
Martin echoed Helton’s praise, saying McCullough won over the USC staff in a half-day when he interviewed for the job. And McCullough was more than happy to accept the offer.
“[USC] was almost like a place you couldn’t imagine from where I grew up,” McCullough said. “You’d see all these things — the Heisman guys and the prestige of the whole university. Obviously when Coach Helton called I was like, ‘Wow, this is unbelievable.’”
McCullough said that the opportunity to join the Trojans coaching staff was unexpected. He was a star player at the University of Miami in Ohio from 1992 to 1995, leading the RedHawks in rushing all four seasons of his college career. Following a professional career that included time with the Cincinnati Bengals, Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Chicago Enforcers, McCullough began working in education. He was a teacher, athletic director and head football coach at Harmony Community School in Cincinnati.
Since then, McCullough’s coaching career has taken off. He returned to his alma mater in 2010 but left promptly to become the running backs coach at Indiana. His track record at Indiana caught people’s attention at both the professional and college level. McCullough was instrumental in the development of three NFL running backs during his time as a Hoosier: Stephen Houston, Tevin Coleman and Jordan Howard each found immense success at Indiana under McCullough’s tutelage. Coleman was instrumental for the Atlanta Falcons in their Super Bowl run this past season, and Howard made the Pro Bowl in his rookie year in 2016. McCullough will likely add another name to that list soon, as Indiana junior Devine Redding declared for the NFL Draft in January.
Besides his track record, what has set apart McCullough from the rest of the pack is his background as a teacher. Throughout his career, McCullough said he learned the skills necessary to teach young men how to not only learn the nuances of the game of football but also be a “leader of men.”
“I like [McCullough’s] attention to detail, and I can see the guys already progressing from it,” Helton said. “Especially [junior running back] Ronald Jones II — right off the bat, he’s doing things that weren’t showing up last year.”
When asked about the differences between Robinson and McCullough, Jones, who is looking to improve his pass blocking and vision in the hole this spring, said the latter “is definitely more of a teacher.”
“He played running back at the professional level, so he knows what it takes to get there,” Jones said. “He’s giving us tools and different ideas that I’ve never even thought about.”
McCullough has received praise from his colleagues for his attention to detail when it comes to the fundamentals of the game.
“One thing I was looking for in the interview process was running backs coaches that had a great history of their backs taking care of the football,” Martin said. “That’s the thing he’s bringing to the table, and you can already see it in our guys.”
While Los Angeles is different from Bloomington, Ind., McCullough isn’t planning to deviate from his blue-collar mentality.
“I like tough guys who want to be great,” McCullough said. “If they have a great attitude and great effort, we’re going to get it done.”
And while USC is undoubtedly a bigger football school than Indiana, McCullough plans to stick to what has worked for him in the past.
“I’ve got a formula that really works as far as getting guys’ trust,” McCullough said. “But more important is showing them what I can do to help them advance what they’re trying to do in their life.”

The Trojans returned to Howard Jones Field for practice on Tuesday as they continue their march toward the Spring Game in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on April 15. Head coach Clay Helton put his team through various situational drills, including pinning his offense at the
 one-yard line and giving his defense a look at a fast-paced offense. 
Defense Ahead of Offense
As is typical for spring camp, the Trojans’ defense looks sharper than their offense. With a young offensive line with multiple injuries and redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold still developing a rapport with some of his young wide receivers, the defense has had the advantage in practice.
The defense, which returns seven of 11 starters, has shown playmaking ability throughout the spring. An experienced secondary featuring junior Iman Marshall, redshirt senior Chris Hawkins and senior Marvell Tell III has challenged Darnold on a daily basis. Sophomore cornerback Jack Jones even picked off the Heisman favorite and was in the clear for a pick-six before the play was whistled dead.
The defensive line also dominated on Tuesday, constantly putting the Trojans’ patchwork offensive line on the back foot, and Helton admitted the latter unit still had much work to do.
“You try not to pull your hair out, but you also expect some growing pains there,” Helton said.
Freshman defensive tackle Marlon Tuipulotu has also stood out this spring, as he looks to fill the large shoes of Stevie Tu’ikolovatu on the defensive line. It hasn’t been too tall of a task for the freshman, who has impressed the coaching staff with his strength and maturity.
Trojans Battle Injuries 
As the Trojans have gotten deeper into spring ball, injuries have started to pile up. Helton announced that senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao successfully underwent surgery on his elbow. Considering Talamaivao is one of the few veteran members on USC’s offensive line, his loss is concerning, but Helton said he was expected to make a full recovery and return during the summer. This news came after another major injury hit the Trojans on Saturday when freshman linebacker Taylor Katoa tore his ACL.
Sophomore running back Ronald Jones II (ankle) and offensive linemen redshirt junior Nico Falah (back) and redshirt sophomore Toa Lobendahn (knee) were all limited on Tuesday and will continue to take on a light workload during spring ball in order to get their bodies in shape in time for the fall.
Figuring Out the Offensive Line 
Following the departure of
All-American offensive tackles Chad Wheeler and Zach Banner, USC has used spring practice to assess their options on the offensive line. As injuries limit the Trojans’ three most experienced linemen (Talamaivo, Falah and Lobendahn), Helton and offensive line coach Neil Callaway are looking to develop their options.
“We’re trying to decide the best five,” Callaway said. “I think we’ve made some progress, but we still have a lot of work to do.”
In order to replace Wheeler and Banner, the Trojan coaching staff has entertained a handful of options, looking to find the best combination. Junior Chuma Edoga, redshirt sophomore Roy Hemsley, freshman Andrew Vorhees and redshirt junior Chris Brown have all shuffled along the line this spring.
The Trojans’ offensive line is a puzzle that will take time to figure out, but with two more weeks in spring and camp in summer and fall, the coaching staff has plenty of time left to find a solid starting five.

On Monday, the U.S. women’s hockey team reached the semifinals of the World Championships, knocking out Finland 5-3 to earn a top seeding. The win wasn’t necessarily a surprise for the Americans, who entered ranked No. 6 in the world against their unranked opponents. But its occurrence so close to Equal Pay Day was a moment of symbolic resonance that didn’t go unnoticed by the team or its fans.
On the heels of a historic boycott at every level of the entire women’s hockey program, the victory was another symbolic step forward for a team that has long lived in the shadow of its male counterparts.
The team announced its intention to boycott the IIHF Women’s World Championship in early March after failing to agree to an increase in player salaries with the governing body of USA Hockey. The decision was bold and risky, especially for a group of players who barely make a sustainable income off paltry salaries from their spots on national and NHWL teams.
But it was a risk that the team felt was necessary. After 13 days, and only three nights before the first game of the world championship, USA Hockey released a joint statement detailing a new compromise. The deal might seem insufficient to some — salaries were raised from $1,000 a month to only $4,000 a month — but it was a far cry from the former stubbornness of USA Hockey in regard to equal treatment of its female players.
The ultimate lesson of the players’ boycott was simple — equality of treatment comes quickly with solidarity in protest.
The solidarity of the movement started with the women. Every single American women’s hockey player refused to suit up for the world championship. Starters, benchwarmers, third-stringers — not a single player broke rank. USA Hockey approached members of youth squads, reaching out all the way to the U16 athletes. Even the youngest stolidly refused to participate.
This level of cooperation in a boycott was shocking. It was quickly followed by other staples of women’s athletics in America, with legends like Billie Jean King and Mia Hamm lending their support. 
But the most surprising and moving support of the movement came from the men’s side.
Within a week, statements released by the NHL, NBA, NFL and MLB stood behind the women’s team. Mike Eruzione, the famous captain of the “Miracle on Ice” squad that won the 1980 Olympics, defended the players, demanding that USA Hockey provide all of its players with livable wages. Twenty U.S. senators signed a letter in support of the team. And in a final back-breaking movement, starting members of the men’s team threatened to join the women in their boycott of the world championships if changes weren’t made.
It was a stunning show of support, one that is rare in the discussion of equitable wages between men’s and women’s teams. When the U.S. soccer team launched similar efforts last year, members of the men’s team openly voiced their distaste for the movement in interviews and social media posts. The reaction to the hockey team’s boycott was starkly different and displays the importance of cross-program and cross-sport support for any type of movement toward equality.
Perhaps it’s a sad reflection of the fact that male voices often echo more loudly. Or maybe it just fits the hierarchical importance of men’s and women’s sports, with the men’s hockey team bringing in significantly higher revenue than the women’s team. But nonetheless, the support given by male athletes and organizations helped to drive the women’s movement home, benefiting a team that has struggled for decades.
Without the national popularity that women’s sports such as soccer and gymnastics are afforded, women’s hockey is typically relegated to the back burner of American attention. Because of this, most Americans aren’t aware that players are forced to pick up part-time jobs to pay the bills and buy equipment, since the team doesn’t receive enough funding to buy sticks or gloves.
But the attention the team earned in the last two weeks is an important move forward in creating equal opportunities for female hockey players. The boycott’s hashtag (#BeBoldForChange) became a rallying cry for feminists throughout the country, and its results will lay the groundwork for a continuation of support for women who want to play the game.
And by standing with the women’s hockey team, each of these male organizations put itself on the right side of history. It’s a pattern that should serve as an example for the future. 
Female athletes have battled for the right to play for generations, and they will continue to move mountains in their fight for equality. But when athletes stand together, male and female, in the fight for progress, change will be made more swiftly and athletics as a whole will continue to grow and flourish.

After a strong 2-0 weekend for USC women’s lacrosse, the MPSF awarded senior attacker Michaela Michael and freshman midfielder Kaeli Huff Player of the Week honors on Monday.
Michael earned her eighth career Offensive Player of the Week nod, while Huff received her first Rookie of the Week honor. 
Michael, a 2014 Rookie of the Week recipient, earned Offensive Player of the Week honors this week for her offensive explosions in the Trojans’ wins over Fresno State and Cal this past weekend. USC outscored the two teams by a combined score of 42-9 en route to raising its record to 9-3 on the season.
This week’s award marks Michael’s third straight week being named the Offensive Player of the Week after winning the honor four times in 2016. Michael netted 10 goals, grabbed 17 draw controls and added an assist, a ground ball and a caused turnover to help the Trojans maintain an undefeated 5-0 record at home in 2017.
Against Cal, Michael took fewer than 20 minutes to score six goals, while against Fresno State, Michael took just five minutes to score a hat trick in a four-goal performance. Her 33rd and 34th career three-goal games moved Michael into third place in MPSF history with 196 career goals, and she currently sits in fifth all-time with 258 career points. 
As for first-year midfielder Huff, her Rookie of the Week honor means she joins fellow freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller as the only USC freshmen to earn the award. 
In her first year out of
Eastport-South Manor High School, the two-time High School Academic All-American exploded with a
five-goal performance, which included three ground balls, two caused turnovers and a draw win. Thanks to her five goals against the Bulldogs, Huff now ranks eighth on the team in points (14) and sixth in goals (13).
Since USC debuted its varsity women’s lacrosse program in 2013, the Trojans have won 30 MPSF weekly honors (12 offensive, 10 defensive and eight rookie).
USC also boasts numerous players vying for recognition in annual awards. After winning in 2015, Michael is making a strong case for yet another MSPF Player of the Year title with her team-leading 40 goals, 52 points and 76 draws controlled. Miller, a potential MPSF Rookie of the Year candidate, is giving Huff a run for her money with 29 points, 22 goals, 26 ground balls, 19 caused turnovers and 19 draws controlled.
But with five games left in the regular season, USC still has a long way until postseason awards are doled out. Next up, the
ninth-ranked Trojans (9-3, 3-0 MPSF) will travel to Oregon to battle the Ducks (7-5, 3-1) on Friday. Then they will head down to San Diego State to take on the Lady Aztecs (8-3, 2-1) on Saturday.

When Anton Zaslavski — better known as Zedd — heard about the controversial immigration ban imposed by the Trump administration, he knew he had to take action. Within 72 hours, he assembled a star-studded lineup to perform at Welcome!, a concert to raise funds for the American Civil Liberties Union. That event became a reality on April 3 at the Staples Center.
 A Russian-born, German-raised immigrant, Zedd assembled a team of artists and put out a call to action on Twitter regarding the immigration ban.
 “As an immigrant myself I feel the need to stand up against the tyranny that threatens our basic human rights,” Zedd said on Twitter. “I’m thrilled to come together with Daya, Halsey, Imagine Dragons, Incubus, Macklemore, Skrillex, Tinashe and many more to help raise money for the ACLU, an organization that works daily to defend and preserve the rights guaranteed to us by the Constitution.” 
The show opened with performances from DJ Mija, singer-songwriter Tinashe and a collaboration between Mija and singer-songwriter Miguel. Singer-songwriter Daya took the stage next, followed by singer-songwriter Bebe Rexha, who proudly sported a shirt that read “Immigrant Daughter” and invigorated the crowd with a message of inclusivity: “It does not say you need to RSVP on the Statue of Liberty!” Actor Jared Leto and radio personality Ebro Darden both gave impassioned speeches about empowering minority communities who feel threatened by the Trump administration The pair also hosted a YouTube livestream of the entire event, encouraging fans who couldn’t attend in person to donate to the ACLU.
 Subsequently, rock band Imagine Dragons and rapper Machine Gun Kelly performed. They invited pop artists Halsey and Camila Cabello to contribute their vocals onstage. Hip-hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis enchanted crowds with a touching performance of “Same Love,” surprising the audience with the accompaniment of singer-songwriter Mary Lambert, and celebrated the vivacity of Los Angeles with “Downtown” in collaboration with singer-songwriter Eric Nally.
 “Hatred and fear can never overpower love,” Macklemore said to the cheering crowd at the end of his set. “This is a testament to that this evening.”
 Special guests from the ACLU, including Southern California executive director Hector Villagra, attorney Lee Gelernt and national political director Faiz Shakir, also spoke, thanking Zedd for the event and inciting the audience to action against Trump.
 “As you know, Donald Trump ran a campaign of fearmongering and scapegoating: Mexicans, immigrants, Muslims, women,” Villagra said. “We’re fighting for healthcare for everyone; we’re fighting for a woman’s right to an abortion; and we’re fighting for the right of a transgender student to go to school with full dignity. We’re fighting because the soul of our country is in jeopardy right now.” 
Next on stage was electronic dance music producer Skrillex followed by rock band Incubus. After a video message commending efforts by  artists and audience members to enforce civil liberties from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, a representative from Garcetti’s office presented Zedd with an award of recognition for organizing the event and supporting the ACLU.
Finally, Zedd himself took the stage and ended the evening alongside Halsey, Cabello and Incubus lead guitarist Mike Einziger.
 “My hope is that the actions we take, and the words we say and the messages we spread do eventually get to [Trump], and he realizes there are a lot of people in this world who will take other people’s good over their own,” Zedd said. “You guys are a part of something really big, and I’m hoping to start a movement — if you guys would like to be a part of it, spread the message, have a conversation.”

On Friday, the USC Concert Choir will perform at Music of Our Time, a concert featuring music from renowned composers around the globe. The concert is anything but a regular choral music event. Unlike typical choral concerts, the concert choir will perform music by living composers from Los Angeles to Venezuela to Australia.
 Each composer will bring a  unique voice to the concert, incorporating  voice techniques that make this concert stand out. The concert choir will sing in multiple languages in addition to English, including Korean, Latin, Spanish, French and Maranao.
 Lucy McKnight, a freshman majoring in music composition and also a member of the concert choir, provided insight into the choir’s dedication and hard work toward the concert these past couple of weeks.
 “Preparation for the concert has been intense, as we are singing so many difficult pieces, all of them completely from memory,” McKnight said.
 The concert choir worked with composers to comprehensively understand the pieces they are performing so they can be executed as the composer would like. They have been lucky to work with a particular L.A.-based Filipino composer, Nilo Acala, who came in to help the choir understand the story and emotion behind his piece.
 The concert also features the works from composers that strike close to home. The concert choir will be singing three French pieces composed by Morten Lauridsen, a professor of composition.
 Although the choral pieces are composed in French, language is not a barrier for the concert choir.
 “In order to prepare [Lauridsen’s] music, we first memorized it without the French words, so we could master the music,” McKnight said. “Then, with the help of a student in the choir who knows French, we added the words back in and memorized it all again.”
 After working with the music for many weeks, the concert choir met with Lauridsen, who helped them better understand the musicality and phrasing of his pieces. According to McKnight, Lauridsen even rehearsed along with the choir while singing and playing the piano.
 Frank Ticheli, a professor of music composition, worked with the concert choir on his piece “There Will Be Rest.” Ticheli came to a concert choir rehearsal and conducted the choir, showing them how he wanted the phrasing of each line executed, as well as the dynamics throughout the piece.
 Rehearsing with the composer of the piece allowed for the choir to perform each piece according to the composer’s intent and feelings when composing it. The concert choir was able to better understand and connect with the music on a personal level, moving beyond the notes on the page to perform with nuance and feeling.
 Music of Our Time will take place on Friday at the Newman Recital Hall. The concert is free admission to all USC students with RSVP required. The concert will run from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

I first encountered Thirteen Reasons Why in middle school, reading Jay Asher’s novel alone in my bed as the entire house sat quiet around me. At 13 and 14 years old, I always found myself reading when the night is the most frightening: the rest of my family asleep, left alone with nothing but my thoughts. When everything is still and you’re half-asleep, the words become louder. The characters throw shadows on your bedroom walls.
 Told partly in the voice of a dead girl, Hannah Baker, Thirteen Reasons Why gave me goosebumps — the kind you don’t want right before you fall asleep. And yet, with a story about the aftermath of a high school suicide, Thirteen Reasons Why evokes a terror that feels real. When Hannah’s voice begins emanating from tapes she left behind, we begin to realize that the ghosts in the novel are real, too.
 When I discovered that Netflix was releasing an original series based on the book, my enthusiasm was muted. I could not imagine how it could be done: an attempt to force the story into television. Though I don’t think much about Asher’s book anymore — it was not a favorite and did not change my outlook on anything — I can still remember the way it rattled me, seemed to echo inside me and uncover my own fears and insecurities.
 The Netflix original lacks that, for no reason or fault of its own — except that imagination is much darker, realer and scarier than what can ever be created on screen. Nothing reenacted by 20-something actors can ever parallel the fear inside me when I read about Hannah Baker by myself, her voice ominous and clear in my own head.
 13 Reasons Why, the TV version, is brighter. And cleaner. The characters have heavily blushed cheeks and make snappy jokes. They look like college kids, clean-cut and attractive, the youth Hollywood estimates can pass as high school sophomores: coiffed hair, red car, letter jackets.
 And yet, though the series may fall into a conventional aesthetic, it also at once manages to be surprisingly emotionally subtle. Its nuance reaches far beyond its face value. Because as much as you think you know 13 Reasons Why, you don’t. And as much as you think you know teenagers like Hannah (Katherine Langford), you have a lot to learn. In the series’ opening episode at least, Hannah is the chirpy and bewildered new girl in school, clinging to fast friends and falling for boys with sweet things to say. She is naive, yes, but she is also witty, acerbic,
self-confident — even through the tapes narrating her own suicide letter.
 Hannah leaves us feeling perplexed because this bubbly girl is not someone who we can reconcile with the act of suicide, much less the cryptic recorded messages she leaves for her peers to pass along lest their names be published in conjunction to her death. And yet, as much as I am tempted to call this shininess unsubtle, it also presents a more eerie and realistic possibility: that maybe the happiest people are the ones least immune to sadness.
 13 Reasons Why contains more than I would conventionally give it credit for. As much as it is a show that looks — at least on the surface — like it misunderstands teenagers, 13 Reasons Why does get several things right: how something can go wrong so quickly and how those with the bravest faces can also hide the darkest woes. How easily something simmering under the surface can explode and touch everyone around it, in high school and especially when everyone owns a cell phone.
 These are layers maybe the show itself isn’t aware of yet, but every member of its teenage audience will identify with: the frantic need to feel wanted and the horrible stomach drop when you realize that you were used and betrayed from the very first encounter.
 13 Reasons Why is a series rooted in teenage cruelty, but it is also more than that. It is a series anchored in its characters’ desperate attempts to understand and reconcile their worlds with tragedy. And even through all my pre-judgments, the show accomplished something I did not grasp until the end of the first episode — namely, that it does what perhaps no other high school show has done before. It unapologetically projects the consequences of cruelty, betrayal and selfishness on teenage lives and spins that through its very premise.
 Throughout the series, the characters must ask themselves, and we along with them: What does Hannah want? How did they miss the signs, and what could have been done differently? How can they redeem themselves, and do they deserve to?

It’s the first full week of April, which means two things: The spring semester is almost over, and festival season is quickly approaching. Music festivals are bustling with thousands of attendees and
larger-than-life entertainers, making them a popular attraction for many college students.
One of the most important aspects of the experience is creating a look that not only showcases individuality but also adds to the unique vibe of each festival. These four gender-neutral suggestions are ways you can accomplish this with your own festival outfit.
Embroidered Patches
These can be put on jean jackets, shorts, ball caps, backpacks or anything else you think could use a personal touch. They can add a pop of color to any piece of clothing without distracting from the rest of the outfit, or they can be featured more prominently to create a unique effect.
 Whether you want to capture the beauty of nature with florals or desert designs, channel your vintage punk or rock roots or add a psychedelic touch, patches can represent different themes to create your desired aesthetic. Plus, for those planning an outfit on a budget, patches are an inexpensive way to make a statement.
 Overalls
Festivals are crowded, multi-day ordeals with unpredictable weather. As much as creating a pleasing aesthetic is an integral part of the experience, making sure your clothes can make it through the weekend is also important. Overalls help make an outfit both fashionable and functional. The pant legs can be rolled up or left alone depending on the weather.
 Denim is also durable enough to withstand rowdy crowds and extreme weather if necessary. Overalls can be different shades of the standard blue or colored to coordinate with whatever you decide to wear underneath them. What’s paired underneath the overalls also allows for a degree of freedom, from a crop top to long sleeves to a vintage graphic tee.
 Statement Jewelry
Sometimes, accessories can make or break an outfit. A bold statement piece can add a layer of
dimension to an outfit, allowing you to distinguish yourself from other festival-goers. Pieces can be anything from a single, large earring to a lace choker to a gold chain.
A statement piece can also present a relatively inexpensive way to create a desired aesthetic, though this is up to the discretion of the person curating the look. Be
careful when selecting a piece of jewelry to ensure it doesn’t drown the outfit. 
Statement pieces work best when the rest of the outfit is coordinated around it, so you might want to start with this when you go shopping, if you wish to include it in the ensemble. Also, take into consideration that you are attending a festival, meaning that you may want to think about whether you want to carry that particular piece you have selected around all day.
Graphic T-shirts
Perhaps the most tried-and-true article of clothing for any festival, graphic T-shirts continue to be staples at any music-related event. Shirts can depict images associated with the performers on the bill, classic rock artists for a more vintage look or simply include the name of the festival. 
Graphic designs should not be limited to just music, however, with floral designs, cartoon drawings or images that evoke memories of the beach during summertime. They can be paired with a jean jacket or cool shades or worn under overalls. Graphic T-shirts can be paired with almost anything and are a safe bet when coordinating an outfit.

As the end of the semester approaches and students are beginning to seek summer employment, many Trojans are likely to encounter offers for unpaid internship experiences. While some argue that unpaid internships are little better than slave labor, in truth, they fill a niche role in the professional world and in education. This is not to say that the institution of unpaid internships is perfect, or that nothing about them should be changed. However, it must be acknowledged that unpaid internships do serve a purpose.
First of all, students who secure paid internships are about twice as likely as those with unpaid internships to receive job offers upon graduation, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. This likely outcome only compounds the problem for those students whose work goes uncompensated. Additionally, unpaid internships often come under fire because people with low incomes usually lack access to the opportunities that they can provide. Even so, the benefits of an unpaid internship should be discussed frankly.
Although I was not financially compensated for my work, I was happy to work as an unpaid intern at the District Attorney’s office and at a local civil rights law firm because I knew that the work I was doing was important and because the experience was truly benefiting me. I can say with full faith that without the unpaid internship experiences that I had during my time as a USC student, I likely would not have been accepted to the University of Chicago Law School.
Even with the stress of going unpaid for over-20-hour workweeks, my internships opened doors for me that would otherwise remain shut. In fact, I made many friends and connections because of my internships that went on to help me a great deal, probably more than the money would have. Additionally, professional experience is of extremely high importance in the application process for graduate schools and for securing future employment, but the only reliable way to get that experience while in college is to work as an intern. However, many students simply cannot afford to work without pay.
In recognition of that, USC has stepped in and provided support to Trojans willing to spend their time and effort to make the world a better place. Here at USC, we are lucky to have organizations like the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Global Fellows Internship Program and the Leonard Schaeffers Fellows Program that are capable of funding unpaid summer internships that provide students with an educational and professional experience. Unruh’s funding, for example, is necessary for those interested in public service, political communications and law because unpaid internships are often the chief way to gain professional experience and necessary networking skills in those fields. The government is not required to pay its interns, and public interest groups typically do not have the funding to provide willing students with full pay. Therefore, both will usually only hire students on the condition that they work for college credit or as volunteers. These conditions exempt the employer from needing to pay students for their labor.
The purpose of an internship is to push a student farther down their professional path, not to stunt their economic or professional growth. Perhaps there needs to be a shift away from expecting the employer to pay for a student’s labor and toward asking the University for financial assistance for those who cannot afford to work without pay. An employer is simply not required to provide internship opportunities, after all. 
But if the University leverages its community connections and if the Trojan Family operates like a true family that looks out for its own, there may be hope for more equitable internship programs. For example, Trojan employers could open their doors to more unpaid interns, but the University could provide funding for those students who cannot afford to work for free. In this way, the purpose and accessibility of internships can preserved without compromising their benefits to students who are looking to broaden their professional horizons. Unpaid internships may be somewhat unfair, but they need not be when the University can feasibly provide some relief.

During the summer before I started college, I had what I believed to be the world’s worst job. I worked for 40 hours a week in the “pizza parlor” of Raging Waters, California’s largest (and most overcrowded) water park. My eight-hour shifts involved getting yelled at by angry customers, manning a 100-plus-degree pizza oven in 100-plus-degree weather and wearing a polyester outfit covered in toucans.
However, this exhausting, unglamorous job had an advantage over many of the summer positions offered to college students: It was paid. 
For today’s college student searching for an internship, it feels as if there are 300 unpaid positions for every one paid position. Obviously, many unpaid internships have inherent value as a resume booster and experience builder, but they also are inherently unfair. 
Let’s say you’re a hiring manager at a top magazine. You’re looking at two resumes — both students majored in journalism, but one student spent his summer working as a cashier, while the other had an unpaid internship writing for a well-known publication. Obviously, the student with prior experience in the field would be desirable. But what about that student who worked as a cashier to save money over the summer for his fall tuition bill? Or the girl who worked in retail, even though she wants to work in politics? 
It is clear that internships are linked to opportunity, but the prevalence of unpaid positions that only a select few can afford furthers the inequality of this opportunity. For students who need to use their summers — and free time during the academic year — to make money, unpaid internships come at a significant opportunity cost. Even if they are lucky enough to get some expenses covered by their employer, every hour spent at the internship is an hour they could have spent making money they may need to support themselves.
Even if students can afford unpaid internships, they still run the risk of wasting their time in position that doesn’t provide them with a valuable experience. Perhaps the majority of unpaid internships provide excellent learning experience and connections for students, but there also are a large number that lack these benefits. We’ve all heard the typical unpaid intern horror stories — staring at a blank computer screen all day, dusting the office, making constant coffee runs — that are found in all career sectors. And it’s one thing to work an awful job if you leave with a paycheck, but it’s another if you’re getting absolutely nothing out of it, whether it is money or life experience. 
Admittedly, I’ve taken on multiple unpaid internships with government organizations and nonprofits, supported both by external stipends and by working part-time paid jobs on the side, and have found them extremely beneficial. I’ve been lucky enough to have internship supervisors who understood the issues facing unpaid interns, and responded by allowing flexible schedules to work additional jobs and assigning real responsibilities. 
Programs such as the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics definitely fill an important void by providing students who take an unpaid internship with funding. In addition to providing funding, Unruh serves a useful role as an “go-between,” or an institution a student can go to with questions or concerns about their internships. 
However, there is still more that can be done at the university level to protect students from unpaid internships that are downright exploitative, and to ensure fair access to those that aren’t. One step would be offering more stipends that are solely need-based.
Additionally, some internships require students to receive academic credit for the position — which comes at thousands of dollars in additional costs for USC students, especially if the internship takes place over the summer, during which students do not receive financial aid. This academic unit requirement for some unpaid internships is partially due to federal requirements meant to ensure that students “learn” from unpaid positions. Though well-intentioned, these requirements have helped to create a market for universities to charge tuition during the summer session.
In the meantime, students should be careful while considering unpaid internship offers for this summer to ensure that they find a position that will value their uncompensated time. And students that do accept these positions need to recognize that it is a privilege not afforded to many students.

Nowhere does brunch better than Los Angeles. There are countless brunch spots around the city with delicious food and a great atmosphere. Brunch is the reward we all need for sleeping in and skipping breakfast. There’s nothing better than waking up on a weekend morning and chowing down on a fresh, savory piece of avocado toast or a gooey breakfast sandwich loaded with bacon. The only problem is choosing where to go. So below is a list of five of Los Angeles best brunch spots to help you narrow down your options.

Republique
The first thing you’ll notice about this restaurant is the impressive decor. The space gives off a European vibe and is filled with long, communal tables where you’ll be certain to meet interesting people. Republique serves French plates and delicious pastries. People rave about their Croque Madame and Kimchi fried rice with poached eggs. You can’t go wrong with any of the pastries, but many recommend the croissants and eclairs.

Poppy + Rose
If you like classic American brunch, Poppy + Rose is for you. What’s better than an eatery known for their chicken and waffles? This cafe is nestled in Los Angeles’ Flower District and serves delicious comfort food. Most people come for the chicken and waffles, but many enjoy the pulled pork hash and eggs benedict. You can’t go wrong here!

Zinc Cafe & Market
This peaceful Arts District cafe is a must-try brunch spot for anyone living in Los Angeles. It’s a vegetarian restaurant with an inviting atmosphere and bright outdoor courtyard. Personal favorites include their tomato and burrata salad, the Zinc waffle and their famous avocado toast. The toast is crispy, slathered in butter and topped with radish salad, chives, lemon zest and — of course — fresh avocado.

Farmshop
This market-style restaurant was created to highlight local California growers and food producers. The decor is described as barn-like and artisanal. There is a sit-down restaurant on one side and a market on the other. The market serves delicious cheeses and other artisan pantry items. For brunch, sit at the restaurant and try their Baba Ganoush or Coddled Eggs with Smoked Salmon. The fresh, local food certainly won’t disappoint.

Artisan House
This is a casual brunch spot with an industrial vibe and, like Farmshop, a market on the side. Artisan House has a menu brimming with delicious food and cocktails. It offers a brunch buffet with tons of options including eggs benedict, french toast and buttermilk pancakes. Artisan is situated right in Downtown Los Angeles, and it should definitely be on a list of must-try spots.

The first time I heard about The Last Bookstore, I found the name intriguing. A quick online search returned the official webpage, where the store owner Josh Spencer quips, “The name was chosen with irony, but seems more appropriate with each passing day as physical bookstores die out like dinosaurs from the meteoric impact of Amazon and e-books.” 
We millennials have been caught in a strange, transitory time when “opening” books has been casually replaced by “switching” them on. But for most of us bibliophiles, the transition is still a protracted battle in our minds. Like every generation that idolizes the era that marks their formative years, we can’t escape the allure of nostalgia that physical books evoke in us.
I feel it the moment I step inside the place. As I wade through the huge space filled with books both old and new, it feels like I have chanced upon a porthole into an alternate universe. The various art installations involving old books — the artful arrangement of books in the space above the counter at the entrance, the mezzanine floor that houses the “Labyrinth” with its  portals surrounded by books, the bookcase featuring flying books and its book tunnels — are a perfect collision of art with the world of books, and it gives me the feeling of having tumbled into a bibliophile’s favorite dream.

The familiar whiff of musty books (the best kind, in my opinion), takes me back to some of my childhood’s happiest memories when my love affair with books first began: The time when I fell in love with adventures while exploring secret coves, hidden treasures and remote islands alongside the Famous Five. The time when I would put on my detective’s hat and go on a mystery-solving spree with Nancy Drew. The time when Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer and Dan Brown’s cliffhangers would keep me up all night. The time when I was so inspired by Anne Frank’s diary that I decided to keep a journal. The time when M&B did more to my idea of teenage romance than any movie. The time when more than my school year, I looked forward to another year at Hogwarts — casting magical spells, befriending beasts and fighting dark wizards with Harry Potter and his wizard friends. The time when Ayn Rand’s portrayal of Dominique Francon and Dagny Taggart became the paragon of a strong, independent woman in my mind.
The time when my favorite post-school Saturday afternoon ritual involved cuddling up on the sofa with one of these treasures in hand and losing myself in the world that the pages unfolded before me. The time when the most difficult decision in life was selecting what books to buy within my limited budget when dad would take me to one of the biggest bookstores in town every summer vacation.
Eventually, I started earning enough money to buy every book that I wanted. But, sadly, it got to a point when the daily drudgery of waking up early for office would take precedence over my appetite for lying awake with a book all night. And gradually, the glorious habit got replaced by staying informed through pithy stories and musings of people I follow on my “smart” device. But every now and then, the bibliophile in me would rebel, not yet ready to give in to the robotization. 
A few months before I enrolled in the master’s program and moved to the U.S., I signed up for a membership at a private library nearby, to rekindle my love for physical books. One evening, when I was curled up in my bed, slipping into Himalayan dreams with a Ruskin Bond in hand, I found to my dismay that when I encountered an unfamiliar word, I instinctively tried tapping it to look up its meaning! I knew the luxury of technology had breached the comfort of nostalgia. Perhaps Josh Spencer was right, and it is only a matter of time.
