When Luis Garcia Rico was riding his bike to Wing Stop one night for a quick dinner during finals, he saw flashing lights behind him. Confused, he pulled over at Jefferson Street and Vermont Avenue. A Los Angeles Police Department officer then proceeded to handcuff him, search him and give him a “fix-it ticket” for not having a light on his bike.
Discussion · Officers from DPS and LAPD discussed racial profiling with members of the Latino Student Assembly at an event on Tuesday. - Scott Fairbanks | Daily Trojan
Following the incident, Rico, a junior majoring in political science and American studies, noticed a number of bicyclists riding without bike lights who were not  pulled over. He couldn’t help but wonder: Was I targeted?
“It became kind of blatant at that point, and I said, ‘OK, this isn’t just about a bike light,’” Rico said. “I couldn’t help but think, ‘Were they looking for someone? Did they just want to mess with someone?’ … It’s kind of hard to trust the judgment they are doing the right thing.”
Rico’s experience and others like it prompted a panel discussion Tuesday between members of the Latino Student Assembly and officers from USC’s Department of Public Safety and LAPD.
“It came to [the Assembly’s] attention that certain actions were taken by LAPD or DPS that seem to be unfair,” said Julian Tarula, political affairs director for LSA.
Sandra Cordero, a 2004 USC alumna, moderated the panel. The other panelists were DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas, LAPD Senior Lead Officer Sean Anderson, Tarula and Rico.
Tarula said LSA decided to hold the event to encourage dialogue between Latino students and law enforcement officers and fight misconceptions.
“A lot of students of color feel like DPS might be out there to get us,” Tarula said. “There are [also] perceptions from DPS on the surrounding community that affect students that might look like students from the surrounding community.”
Rico said he has generally had a good relationship with DPS, but a number of small instances have made him feel uncomfortable.
“I feel like lines have been crossed, like getting I.D.ed on campus when I’m just on the way back home from student meetings, just little things like that that make me feel like I don’t belong,” Rico said. “It’s unfortunate that those kind of things happen because I know that’s not every DPS officer; it’s just individuals who might have a criminalized view of brown folk, black folk, that are giving DPS as a whole a bad name.”
The panel discussed how law enforcement officers interact with diverse communities.
Anderson said cultural sensitivity training is part of the police academy’s program. Thomas, who previously worked with LAPD, noted that because of historically negative encounters between the LAPD and people of color, the police force has made a concerted effort to diversify its staff and improve its racial sensitivity.
“You can actually look at the racial percentages in Los Angeles and they will mirror the LAPD,” Thomas said.
Anderson said the criteria for pulling people over and handcuffing them are different in each situation, but people tend to group the situations in a clump. When referring to Rico’s case, he said officers face a dilemma in an area where there are a lot of young people biking who might not know that having a bike light is required under California law, considering some might be international students.
“The officer is thinking, ‘am I going to stop all these people on their bikes versus just south or west of campus where people know they are supposed to have lights on their bikes?’” he said.
Anderson admitted, however, that often situations like this are used as probable cause to talk to the person.
“These encounters are never going to be perfect, people are never going to be completely satisfied and it is an issue. But these are the reasons why some of the things happen,” Anderson said.
Thomas said the issue is also in the students’ hands because there are resources for those who feel they have been unfairly stopped or targeted by LAPD or DPS.
“The worst you can do is ignore your feelings and say nothing happened,” he said.
Thomas said there is an LAPD policy that if a person files a complaint that isn’t frivolous, the department will investigate it; the concerned citizen will get a notification in writing that the situation is being investigated within 10 days. This policy could help students who feel they have been the victims of racial profiling, he said.
Both Thomas and Anderson agreed that one officer’s actions cannot reflect upon the whole organization.
“You can expect that there are just some officers that don’t have the greatest people skills,” Anderson said.
Thomas agreed, explaining that police inevitability have some biases based on their personal experiences
“Police officers are humans too, you’re going to get good and bad. Our goal is that the community does not think [these incidents] reflect the entire force,” Thomas said.
Students said the event succeeded in opening a dialogue between law enforcement and students of color, but they said it will take more time and discussion to get at the heart of the problem.
“It was a good start, but as far as anything coming out of it, I still see it as a long way down the road, and I think in order for anything to really happen, a lot more of these events have to happen and a dialogue needs to happen,” said Jacob “Junior” Robinson, a graduate student studying film production. “I still think that we’re just labeling things right now … we’re not tackling anything, we’re just putting a face on it.”
if you don’t want to be harrased by cops, stop dressing like a hood rat. it’s pretty simple!
I think DPS, or should I say? rent-a-cops here need to stop worrying about a brown man on a bicycle without a light on the streets of Los Angeles. There are lots of them, and stopping a brown man without a bicycle light is in essence–harassment. DPS needs to focus on University Park Campus and the surrounding communities in which stuents would typically live. A brown man on a bike near Wingstop, which is near Figueroa and 23rd st., is out of the way. Oh, is DPS concerned that a brown man will hurt himself because he cannot see without a bicycle light at night? *sarcasm* 
Bottom line is: DPS needs to stop bothering with the peripheral petty things and focus on things that would preclude violence and robberies to students.
The most disturbing thing about profiling is how effective it actually can be. It is very easy for us to vilify the evils racial profiling – however just think about the odds and realize every single one of us does this all the time whether we admit it or not.
LAPD / DPS definitely use racial profiling. At least you got a ticket for not having a bike light.
How about being stopped because you have a backpack, and the bike you are riding seems to be big for your height?

USC was recently named to President Obama’s 2010 Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for its students’ work in the surrounding neighborhood, but community service organizers recognize that the school still has work to do.
This is the third year in a row USC has been named to the honor roll, though it has yet to reach the highest level, the Presidential Award, or the second-highest, Honor Roll with Distinction.
Melissa Gaeke, director of USC’s Volunteer Center, said the award is great recognition of the center’s work. She noted, however, that USC’s community service program still has room to grow.
Gaeke said the Volunteer Center is hindered by a fragmented approach to community service, but it could help get more students involved if more unity existed among community service groups.
Gaeke said she plans to look at universities given Presidential or Honor Roll with Distinction Awards to see how their community service programs function.
USC earned a place on the honor roll for programs like the Joint Educational Project, which offers students some form of course credit to teach at neighborhood schools. But the rating was also based on its volunteer activities such as Troy Camp, the Alternative Break Program and Greek-affiliated service events.
The award is based on percentages, measuring how many students are involved in civic service in relation to how many are enrolled as well as the amount of funding devoted to community service, according to Kevin Days, adviser on the board of Higher Education Special Initiatives, which supports the president’s higher education community service honor roll program.
Days said that, though numbers are calculated, this is not the most important factor.
“Number of hours and programs are important, but the impact made is more important,” Days said.
The program was launched in 2006 by Learn and Serve America under the Corporation for National and Community Service. Seven hundred and thirty-six schools of higher education were named to the honor roll this year, a hundred more than in 2009.
Days said the award emphasizes an important aspect of higher education.
“So often the discussion is about tuition, ratings … beyond just contributing graduates with diplomas, the honor roll gives schools an opportunity to discuss how service is part of the solution to many of the issues we’re facing as a nation,” Days said.
Students who have participated in community service at USC said they think it is important to give back to the community.
“USC, being in its unique surroundings, reminds us that not everyone is as lucky as us,” said Tina Coles, a senior majoring in psychology. “In some ritzy areas, schools may not even have the reason to do as much community service as you do here.”

Undergraduate President-elect Chris Cheng and Vice President-elect Nehi Ogbevoen announced their 2010-2011 executive officers at Tuesday’s Senate meeting, marking their first official decision since winning the election.
Taking office · President-elect Chris Cheng announced the newly appointed members of his executive office at the Undergraduate Student Government meeting. Tuesday. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
The executive officers for 2010-2011: Maya Babla, a junior and a 2009 vice presidential candidate, will be the chief of staff; Brian Anderson, a junior and the current director of alumni affairs, will be the treasurer; Elizabeth Trower, a junior and the current director of the leadership fund, will be the senior director of communications; Richard Pizano, a junior and a member of Program Board’s concert committee, will be the executive director of Program Board; Chris McAbrey, a junior and Program Board’s current production manager, will be Program Board’s finance director.
The executive officers will work directly with the president and vice president on a variety of issues throughout the year. They are heavily involved in executive decisions and in the functions of USG as a whole.
Cheng said choosing the executive officers was a lengthy process. Cheng and Ogbevoen received about 25 applications for the five positions.
“We spent over 25 hours reviewing and deliberating,” junior Chris Cheng, the president-elect, said. “We checked their listed sources on their résumés as well as their unlisted sources.”
Cheng said he and Ogbevoen considered a number of factors in selecting their officers.
“We looked for team leaders and hard workers, people who are going to do their job well and contribute to the team,” Cheng said. “It’s an incredible combination of different personalities and yet everyone has something in common.”
Ogbevoen stressed that they chose people who could bring different skills and experiences to the table.
“We didn’t want everyone to be the same,” Ogbevoen said. “We wanted everyone to have a special input through our organization and through the decisions that the seven of us will be making.”
McAbrey said he applied for the position because he wanted to be more involved with USG after spending two years with Program Board. He said he has had a lot of prior experience, and the position of Program Board finance director is well suited to his interests and skills.
“It’s a big undertaking. I’ll be managing a very large budget, and, as a member of the executive committee of USG, there are a lot of responsibilities,” McAbrey said. “I’m a little nervous, but I’m mostly excited for next year.”

With the score tied 12-12 in the first set, reigning Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week Joshua Walker went to his knees in search of a missing contact.
Racking them up · Sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli recorded a team-high 21 kills, six digs and two assists in a losing effort Tuesday. - Gage Allard | Daily Trojan 
Three minutes later, as Hawai’i’s opposite hitter finally arose to Johnny Nash’s 1972 hit “I Can See Clearly Now” blaring on the arena sound system, the No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team and the Galen Center crowd erupted in a throng of laughter. Unfortunately, for the Trojan faithful it would be Walker and his No. 5 Hawai’i Warriors’ team that would get the last laugh Tuesday night.
In a match that saw constant bantering from both sides, two injury timeouts and action more befitting of a NCAA tournament environment, the Warriors (12-7, 8-6) defeated USC (10-7, 8-6) in four sets, much to the dismay of the 200 plus fans in attendance.
Hawai’i regained its step after dropping Monday night’s match to the Trojans, in large part because of the 180-second hiatus caused by the missing lens. When play resumed, the Warriors, behind eight kills from Walker took the first set 32-30 and never looked back.
“We are conscious of our failures in the first set, but maybe it is just too big of an elephant in the room right now,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “If we knew exactly what the problem was, trust me it would have been gone by now.”
In the winning effort, Hawai’i was led by 6-foot-9 opposite hitter Jonas Umlauft’s impressive 25 kills and Walker, a notorious Trojan-killer, who chipped in with 22 kills.
While the match marks the team’s second win in three showdowns with the Trojans this season, the victory was hanging in the balance after the Trojans rebounded to take the second set, 30-27, with eight kills by sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and a team set hitting percentage of .235.
But in a night of few silver linings, the Warriors took advantage of every mistake made by USC. In the third set, Hawai’i quickly got out in front of the Trojans, 6-1, and capitalized on several service and attack errors down the stretch to take the set with relative ease.
The fourth set looked promising for the Trojans, as a block and kill by junior middle blocker Austin Zahn gave the team an early 13-9 cushion. But in similar fashion to its play in the month of February, USC folded when the match got close.
Using three straight errors and a block by Umlauft, the Warriors took a late 27-26 lead they wouldn’t relinquish en route to a 30-27 victory.
“USC has been our new rival the past few years, and we know when we play them it’s going to be a battle,” Warriors’ outside hitter Joshua Walker said. “You know if you can beat a team like [USC], you have a very good team.”
For the Trojans, their bid for a three-game win streak was denied, but in defeat, optimism and improvement were the main messages Ferguson took away from the night’s match.
“The offense continues to improve and our attackers are getting better and better each match,” Ferguson said. “I like the new alignment we have in there with [freshman] Maddison McKibbin starting at opposite. Right now it’s all little things.”

After a rare weekend off from competition, the No. 3 USC men’s tennis team is back at home to face No. 17 Wake Forest in the first ever meeting between the two programs.
Coming off one of the biggest wins in program history, a road win at UCLA for the first time since 1991, USC coach Peter Smith is wary of a potential letdown against a strong and deep Demon Deacon (5-2, 2-0) squad.
Trap · Freshman JT Sundling and the Trojans will try to avoid a letdown against Wake Forest after beating UCLA on the road last week. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
“Yes, I am worried about a letdown. Wake is a team capable of beating any team in the country,” Smith said. “You only have to look at their match with No. 2 Tennessee to realize the potential they have. They are strong at the top and have good depth.”
The Demon Deacons are coming off a 4-3 home loss to the Volunteers. In that match, Wake Forest’s No. 20 Tripper Carleton suffered his first singles loss of the season against No. 4 Tennessee singles player John-Patrick Smith.
Wake Forest No. 67 Steve Forman is the reigning ACC Player of the Week, who along with Carleton will challenge the top of the Trojan lineup. The Demon Deacons have two other players ranked in singles and one ranked doubles team.
The Trojans (12-1, 0-0) understand that Wake Forest is a formidable opponent and say they and will not be preoccupied with the possibility of a setback.
“Coaches worry more about that when they prepare the team,” junior Jaak Poldma said of a potential letdown. “As players, we don’t worry about that, we just have to keep going as before. We know this is an important match.”
The Trojans’ defeat of the Bruins propelled them in the rankings as they moved up from the No. 5 slot to the No. 3 slot, jumping ahead of No. 4 Ohio State and No. 5 Texas, who gave USC its only loss of the season.
For the third time in four weeks,  a Trojan has been named the Pac-10 men’s tennis Player of the Week. This week, sophomore Steve Johnson was honored for his dominating singles win and strong doubles performance with senior Robert Farah at UCLA.
Johnson joins sophomore Daniel Nguyen and Poldma as Trojan recipients of Player of the Week honors.
In the midst of the second half of the season, the road will not get any easier, and the Trojans do not plan on dwelling on their positive accomplishments so far. As they have all season, they will continue to focus on improving their play, starting with Wake Forest at Marks Stadium today.
“We are a little more than halfway through the season,” Smith said. “So many good things have happened to us, but we can’t forget that we have to keep getting one day better everyday.”

For those of you who thought the USC basketball season ended March 6, I got news for you.
You’re wrong.
For the team that overcame adversity and had to adjust to a new coach at the beginning of the season, recorded huge wins over ranked teams, suffered through injuries and bad losses and was boosted back up by the presence of an impact player who was absent at the beginning of the season, there is still a chance it can make the NCAA tournament.
Of course, I’m talking about the Women of Troy.
Yes, the men are done for the season. No two ways about it.
But the women are still fighting for their first tournament bid since 2006 — a fight that will actually occur right in our own backyard.
Thanks to a five-game winning streak to end the season, USC snagged the third seed in the Pac-10 tournament this weekend at the Galen Center. Yet the Women of Troy most likely need one or even two wins to secure their spot in the NCAA tournament.
According to ESPN’s Bracketologist Charlie Crème, USC is currently one of the last four in the tournament and he currently has the Women of Troy as a 10 seed.
If it weren’t for a five-game losing streak, which was sandwiched in between two five-game winning streaks, in the first half of February, the Women of Troy most likely wouldn’t have to worry about their tournament chances.
With impressive wins over No. 23 UCLA (for the sake of this article, all rankings will be current) and No. 15 Texas, to go along with a 12-6 conference record, USC boasts a quality résumé. Its Pac-10 record is the best since the 2004-2005 season and could have been even better without the slump.
USC even has some impressive losses, if such a thing actually exists. In the first game of the year, the Women of Troy lost to No. 5 Xavier in overtime and were barely clipped by No. 7 Duke 78-72 at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Yet, impressive non-conference performance isn’t the only thing the women’s team has in common with the men’s — who defeated ranked teams such as Tennessee and UNLV, as well as St. Mary’s who beat No. 17 Gonzaga Monday night to earn its ticket to the NCAA tournament.
Two months before Tim Floyd submitted his letter of resignation, women’s coach Mark Trakh submitted his. After serving as head coach at the school for five seasons and posting a solid 90-64 record, he decided to call it quits.
Maybe he was frustrated that his five-star recruits kept getting injured. Maybe he was upset the team hadn’t made the NCAA tournament in the last three years after getting there in his first two seasons. Maybe Athletic Director Mike Garrett just had enough of him.
Whatever it was, the Women of Troy were looking for a new coach and found one in former Los Angeles Lakers star Michael Cooper.
Cooper has brought a professional work ethic (Larry Bird once called him the best defender he ever played against) but also a sense of looseness to the USC women’s team. After the win against UCLA, Cooper endeared himself to Trojan fans everywhere by starting his press conference in a sarcastic tone, “My opening statement is, f— UCLA.”
Cooper later apologized for his comment, but the fact of the matter remained: Cooper instilled some swagger and confidence in the Women of Troy.
That confidence was only helped by the much-overdue USC debut of redshirt junior Jacki Gemelos in February, which came with glowing reviews.
Three and a half years and four knee surgeries later, the 2006 McDonald’s All-American and National Player of the Year finally suited up for the Women of Troy against California.
It took a little while for Gemelos to scrape off the rust, but she has put up double-digit points every game.
As Daily Trojan beat writer Jeff Curtis so eloquently put it, “For every turnover she commits, Gemelos makes five plays that remind you why so many people called her a once-in-a-decade prospect in high school. Talent oozes out of her. Gemelos is a gifted and willing passer, a deadly outside shooter and good for at least one ‘did you see that’ moment a game.”
Yet, while Gemelos has been the feel-good story of the Women of Troy this year, the team’s rock has been sophomore Ashley Corral.
She was the first USC women’s basketball player to be named Pac-10 Player of the Week after setting a single-season record for 3-pointers made in a season and hitting clutch free throws in close wins over both Arizona schools this past weekend.
So even though the men’s team won’t wow us with another Cinderella-type run through the Pac-10 tournament this year, there is still meaningful basketball being played in the Galen Center this weekend. Despite the new coach, the injuries and the midseason losing streak, the program that was once a national powerhouse is looking to get back to the tournament for the first time in four years. The least we can do is show some school pride and cheer them on.

What a difference a day off made for senior starter Kevin Couture.
Barely 48 hours after failing to make it out of the first inning, Couture responded with a gem, and the Trojans won at Pepperdine, 5-0.
Comeback kid · Senior Kevin Couture had six strikeouts against just one walk in seven innings of work Tuesday against Pepperdine. Couture got the weekday start after pitching only two-thirds of an inning Sunday. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan
Starting pitchers rarely start back-to-back games, but USC coach Chad Kreuter gave Couture the ball for a second straight start. He threw less than 40 pitches Sunday, lasting only two-thirds of an inning and allowing four runs and seven hits.
Couture (1-0, 3.86 ERA) was a completely different starter Tuesday, throwing seven shutout innings. He allowed just five hits and a walk while striking out six Waves. Senior Shuhei Fujiya followed with two innings of shutout baseball, allowing just two hits.
Both pitchers prevented Pepperdine from getting a single runner past second base.
The Trojans (6-6) got most of the offense they needed from freshman infielder Cade Kreuter, who went 3-4 with a home run and 4 RBI. The younger Kreuter started the scoring in the second inning. He singled home sophomore infielder Matt Foat, giving USC a 1-0 lead.
USC tacked on its second run the next inning, when sophomore Ricky Oropesa — batting second in the lineup — drove in freshman Adam Landecker to make it 2-0.
The score stayed that way into the sixth, when Kreuter hit a 3-1 pitch out for a three-run home run, putting the Trojans up 5-0.  The younger Kreuter has been one of USC’s best hitters this season, batting .333 with two home runs and nine RBI.
Landecker and sophomore outfielder Garret Houts finished the day with two hits apiece, helping USC to an 11-hit attack against the Waves.
But the Trojans don’t have any time to revel in the victory, as they are just starting one of their toughest stretches of the season.
USC returns home tonight to host Connecticut at 5 p.m. at Dedeaux Field, its only home game until March 23 and one of two home games until April 1.
The Huskies (5-2) are coming off of a strong series against Cal State Northridge, taking three of four from the Matadors. They lost the series finale, 5-3, and their only other loss was two weeks ago, a 6-5 loss in 10 innings against Northwestern.
UConn boasts a strong lineup, led by infielder Mike Nemeth. He’s batting .462 through seven games with six RBI.
Second baseman Pierre LePage is picking up where he left off over the summer. The junior starred for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod League, batting .308 and helping the Braves to the title.
He’s hitting .333 with nine RBI, six runs scored and a team-leading three stolen bases.
Fellow Cape Cod leaguer George Springer leads the team with three home runs and 13 RBI.
UConn also has a solid pitching staff, with a team ERA of 3.59.
After Wednesday’s game, the Trojans will prepare to leave for Hawaii for a four-game series. It’s part of a grueling 14-game stretch, in which 12 games are on the road.

Wind and unseasonably cool temperatures didn’t treat the No.13 USC women’s tennis team well, as the No. 9 Baylor Bears defeated the Women of Troy 5-2 Tuesday at Marks Stadium.
The Bears (10-2) were USC’s third top-10 opponent in four matches and looked as good as advertised in their dual meet with the Women of Troy (8-5), capturing the doubles point and then rattling off three straight singles wins to clinch the victory.
The Bears’ first doubles pair of Csilla Borsanyi and Lenka Broosova took advantage of a late break in the first doubles match of the day against freshman Valeria Pulido and junior Maria Sanchez to capture a quick 8-6 victory.
After freshman Danielle Lao and sophomore Alison Ramos hit the Bears back with an 8-5 victory at the second doubles slot, an intense battle at the final doubles pairing decided the doubles point.
Throughout a back-and-forth match, senior Sarah Fansler and junior Lyndsay Kinstler were unable to get ahead of the Bears’ pair of Nina Secerbegovic and Jelena Stanivuk and eventually dropped the set 9-7.
With the doubles point in hand, Baylor began taking care of the singles points, first with a victory in the sixth singles matchup, where Kinstler was unable to hang with Baylor’s Karolina Filipiak, losing 6-2, 6-3.
After Lao and Pulido also dropped their singles matches, the Bears had clinched their victory, and the fifth singles match between Fansler and Stanivuk was stopped with Fansler up a set, giving the Women of Troy their first point of the match.
No. 21 Ramos would end up dropping her three-set affair with Secerbegovic at the No. 2 singles position 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-3, leaving only No. 3 Sanchez with a chance to claim a final point for USC.
Sanchez came through for the Women of Troy, posting a tough three-set victory over Broosova, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (5).
The Women of Troy will next take to the courts against Arizona State this Saturday at noon in Tempe, Ariz.

A curious conglomeration of artists came together to form the questionable but well-meaning backtrack to Tim Burton’s latest cinematic creation. After watching Alice in Wonderland in theaters, moviegoers can now pick up a copy of Almost Alice, an album of songs inspired by the whimsical film.
Tea party · Although none of the songs were featured in the actual movie, Almost Alice is a compilation album of songs inspired by and written around the concept of Burton’s film. - Photo courtesy of Buena Vista Records 
Though the album brings together an admirable amount of artists with different styles from Plain White T’s to 3oh!3, the title’s operative word is “almost,” and the soundtrack falls short of being entertaining. Because each track attempts to take on some aspect of the movie, Almost Alice contains some of the usual awkwardness that comes from the forced effort to create a song for a particular film.
While the concept is interesting at first, after a few songs the message becomes repetitive as each artist tries to form lyrics that tell the same story in his own style. Since Disney is the company behind the movie, its followers were most likely the target audience for the soundtrack, and because of this, most of the songs are full of Radio Disney-friendly beats and sub-par talent.
To kick off this magical mess, pop-rocker Avril Lavigne uses her peppy voice to take on the voice of Alice, singing I found myself in Wonderland throughout her tune “Alice.” Though the song is the album’s most popular track according to iTunes — and probably highly favorable with pop-loving, Disney-following preteens — it makes Lavigne’s lack of vocal range painfully obvious.
Most of the song sounds as if Lavigne is simply yelling, which gives the tune a highly unpolished finish. And the lyrics add to this inadequacy, as Lavigne uses simple, thoughtless words to portray Alice’s characteristic confusion: Is this real? / Is this pretend? / I’ll take a stand until the end.
Although these probably were the thoughts of the fictional character as she stepped into Underland, Lavigne’s lyrics offer no insightful thoughts, and the higher her voice gets the more the listener begins to cringe.
The unfortunately catchy, well-produced song “Tea Party” by Kerli continues the tween-friendly musical trend. The song chorus is reminiscent of High School Musical, yet on closer inspection the lyrics of the song are far from high-school appropriate.
Kerli begins by welcoming the listener to the tea party, asking if they want to be her VIP. But later in the song, she sings, Just try and nibble on my biscuits and my rainbow cake, hardly words that parents wish to hear their kids repeat. Indeed, Kerli attempts to take on this scene in the movie with a modern point of view, but by making the subject matter sexual she also manages to distort the tea party’s innocent intentions.
In order to mix up the album’s radio-friendly pop feel, Almost Alice has a track entitled “Very Good Advice,” sung by The Cure’s Robert Smith. With strange rhythms and Smith’s note-shifting voice, the song leads the soundtrack in the extreme opposite direction from which it started.
The strangeness of the song seems fitting for a melancholy cloudy day. The song causes anxiety with its high-pitched background sounds and lyrics — Will I ever learn to do / The things I say — sung like a child exaggeratingly mimicking Frank Sinatra.
For The Cure fans, the song could perhaps offer a flashback, but for those unfamiliar with Smith the song seems strangely out of place in a sea of pop hooks.
A few more songs escape the happy grasp of Disney artists, and, instead of attempting to summarize the movie in its entirety, these songs manage to create tunes that include not only interesting rhythms but messages that can apply to situations beyond the film.
Franz Ferdinand’s “The Lobster Quadrille” takes you in a warm embrace with lead singer Alex Kapranos’ voice coming in as deep and soothing. He sounds like the ringmaster of a circus, describing in a confident voice the acts of the night.
As he sings, Would not / Could not / Join the dance, the eerie mood of Burton’s cult favorite The Nightmare Before Christmas comes to mind. The song could be taken either from a comedic point of view or as the perfectly serious backdrop for a gothic-themed wedding.
Wolfmother’s song “Fell Down a Hole” starts out with a screaming guitar and then continues with even deeper riffs. The song recalls The White Stripes and is perfect for a lively, crowded mosh pit. The beat is wonderfully complex, and, unlike most of the other songs in the album, most of the focus is given to the guitar. The drum creates a complex beat and the cymbal constantly keeps the song going.
A welcome relief from Lavigne’s squealing, the tune seems to unfold easily to the listeners’ ears, ending with the lovely-but-rough sounding guitar.
One of the most interesting tracks on Almost Alice comes from Grace Potter and the Nocturnals’ cover of Jefferson Airplane’s 1960s hit “White Rabbit.”
The song originally drew heavily from Lewis Caroll’s books and focused on the altered reality emphasized in the story. The track keeps the original Spanish influence of the 1960s original, and Potters’ smooth and sultry voice successfully draws the listeners in and keeps the psychedelic mood nearly as well as did Grace Slick’s decades ago. At one point, she gives a shrill scream, followed by a husky laugh and soft piano notes round off the trippy, confusion-ridden song.
All in all, the quirkiness of the album reflects the quirkiness of the film. Although not enough to spend a whole $10 on, the album does contain some notable songs. If listeners take the time to pick through the Disney-infected or unimpressive songs found in the earlier parts of the soundtrack, they will find some tunes that can be the soundtrack to their life, not just that of the lost and confused fictional Alice.

Unless you scored seats on your own private jet, flying home for spring break holds a few certainties: You will encounter a squealing baby, someone with a hacking cough and in-flight food that is unpalatable to a starving refugee.
What happened to edible airline food? The burgers have radioactive cheese and the hot dogs are stomach-rupturing torpedoes, and that’s if they decide to feed you at all. If you have a long flight and are not on a hunger strike, you are on your own food-wise. But if you apply just a bit of forethought, you can ensure you have some tasty snacks or even a decent meal to get you through that screening of Baby Geniuses 2.
As you prepare for a pilgrimage to LAX this weekend, you have two options: Bring your own grub or buy something once inside the terminal. To avoid paying $14 for a breakfast burrito, and because food is one of the few things allowed through airport security, choose the former.
For food with substance, whip together a sandwich to wrap and store in a Tupperware container. For convenience, you can bring along a Larabar or a Kashi Roll bar, but here are a few more specific suggestions.
Ever wonder why you feel run over by a truck when you step off a plane? It’s because of dehydration. It is far easier to become dehydrated when traveling at high altitudes, so snack on some juice-filled fresh fruit (pears or oranges) and drink plenty of water, and you won’t have to worry about bloodshot eyes as you greet your parents on the other end of the flight.
Another idea is pancakes. You can pack them full of fruit, nuts and spices, and they will keep warm for hours if wrapped in foil. Use oatmeal and eggs with a pinch of baking powder for some stupid-simple but tasty pancakes. If you want some protein, toss a scoop of whey powder into the batter, and you have a complete meal to get you through a layover.
If you are stumbling into the airport at 7 a.m., chances are you did not grab breakfast. But that can be fixed by grabbing a bit of cereal before you head out the door and putting it either in a plastic baggie or grabbing a single-serving box. You can’t bring milk past security, but, if you refuse to spend money and don’t mind approaching hoboland, snag a cup from Starbucks and serve yourself some milk from the condiment table.
But between packing and not forgetting your hair dryer, food might be the last thing on your mind until you’ve gotten through the invasive full-body scans. If you do not care about spending some money, there are actually some decent eateries within the LAX terminals.
California Pizza Kitchen ASAP is a solid choice for better-than-fast food but not quite wallet-busting fare. LAX has one in Terminal 5 and another in Terminal 8. There will be laughs for everyone else on the plane if the flight happens to be serving gross microwavable pizza.
Jody Maroni’s Sausage Kingdom, located in Terminal 6, caters to tired and stressed travelers who want to bite into a big juicy sausage-dog. Another decent Terminal 6 spot is Monet’s California Deli, which serves breakfasts and deli-style soups and sandwiches. For something familiar and filling though, check out Chili’s Too, a truncated version of Chili’s in Terminal 4. In Terminal 5, Creative Croissants offers tasty sandwiches and other goodies while El Cholo Cantina has surprisingly good Mexican food. Terminals 2 and 7 have Wolfgang Puck Express if you’d like to give one last farewell to The Lot’s pesto chicken salad sandwich. For something light and refreshing, head to Terminal 1 for a cup of Pinkberry. To catch a game as you grab your food, Terminals 1 and 6 each have a Home Turf Sports Bar.
Of course, if you just want the airport experience and feel Mickey D’s or Burger King calling, LAX definitely has you covered. McDonald’s resturants are in Terminals 1, 5 and 7, and Burger Kings are in Terminals 2, 3 and 4. And if you need a caffeine fix, most terminals have a Starbucks.
So don’t think you have to contemplate wrecking your digestive tract if you get the munchies during a flight. Just put in a couple minutes of forethought and enjoy something decent to offset the screaming babies.

Considering how close In-n-Out Burger is to LAX, why not cruise through there & pick up a couple of burgers for your flight.  There’s a Trader Joe’s right next door that has tasty snack items as well.
The yogurt + fruit parfaits @ the LAX McDonald’s are quite good — and cheap.
Why not imitate the airlines & make yourself one of the “snack boxes” they attempt to sell you for $7: raisins, small can of tuna, crackers, snack size candy bars [you still have some in your desk from Halloween, right?], fruit roll-up, bag of Cheez-Its, nuts.  Think of it as a five hour back-packing trip without water.

Video games aren’t usually considered works of art, but that doesn’t mean they have nothing to offer. Some of the most creative, diverse characters have been spawned by the gaming industry. Before the beautiful graphics can ever be presented as stunning cinematic scenes on high definition televisions, artists must flesh out the concept drawings.
In collaboration with the Gnomon Gallery, Naughty Dog — the company that produced Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, 2009’s Spike Video Game Awards Game of the Year — has found a way to bring out some of its lesser seen artwork.
Out of this world · The new exhibit displays personal works from Naughty Dog employees including one of Judd Simatov’s 3-D character sculptures (top) and a print of Robh Ruppel’s “Steampunk Village.” - Photos courtesy of Bender/Helper Impact 
Founded by Alex Alvarez, the Gnomon Gallery is set in the Television Center in Hollywood among the Gnomon School of Visual Effects and the Gnomon Workshop, a school that trains artists for work in the entertainment and design industry. Originally a creature effects artist, Alvarez founded the gallery as a way to draw attention to talented work.
Given Alvarez’s familiarity with people in the video game industry, he already knew how easily game designers’ efforts could be overlooked.
“People rarely focus on those who made the art [for a game]” Alvarez explained. Having done exhibits with work from Blizzard Entertainment in the past, the Gnomon Gallery was a perfect way to bring the creativity of Naughty Dog artists to light.
As an exhibit, the gallery has a definite impact on visitors. The limited-time exhibit boasts a live D.J., mood lighting and free wine, all of which complemented the various works stationed along the walls.
The gallery enjoyed heavy foot traffic on March 6, its opening night. Expecting nearly 300 guests, the management made sure to have plenty of Naughty Dog employees on hand.
“It’s about exposing people of extraordinary talent,” Alvarez said.
Most of the visitors who stopped by on the exhibit’s opening night were students and industry professionals. More than 75 Gnomon Workshop teachers could be seen examining the images as well.
There was a wide variety of artwork throughout the gallery ranging from computer-generated images to sculptures throughout the gallery. Some pieces sold for $250 or more.
Each piece seemed completely unlike the one next to it, even in instances when both were created by the same person. A few common themes were cityscapes, creatures and machines.
One picture, “Vultureman,” by Khanh Nguyen, featured a humanoid vulture with a long gun, metallic wings, goggles and an electronic wrist protector, reminiscent of Naughty Dog characters like Jak from the Jak and Daxter series.
There were also many works of photography, including a miniature Mountain Dew truck entitled “‘32 Ford,” by Christophe Desse.
Judd Simantov’s putty face sculptures by were comical, including a caricature of Sylvester Stallone with a huge chin and lower lip and one that resembled Obama, though it remained untitled.
Melissa Altobello’s “Home, Sweet Home” featured loosely attached housing networks among a red sky. What-if scenarios, like Altobello’s piece, were inspired by various earthquakes and tsunamis that have torn apart communities, the artist explained. Altobello said she did not stick to themes and preferred to do whatever came at the moment.
The art no doubt reflected a wide range of interests and experimental ideas.
Altobello graduated from the Gnomon Workshop and has been doing art for Naughty Dog for a year. She has been drawing since she was a child.
Because of her ties to Naughty Dog and the Gnomon Workshop, she was able to help organize the artists of the video gaming company into presenting their work at the gallery.
Collaboration is evident at Naughty Dog, especially among the artists.
“Everyone can make suggestions to the work, and everyone is encouraged to present ideas,” Altobello said. The company’s team members were very supportive, with programmers and designers present at the gallery too.
The diversity of the images and styles at the gallery was a clear display of the talent that helped bring about the unique aesthetics of Naughty Dog’s list of popular games.
“Great game art requires many sketches and lots of schooling,” Altobello said. She noted that her own skills have grown more technical over time.
Though there weren’t many sketches on display at the gallery to illustrate the progression from concept to completed work, it was clear that all the art had been well refined and polished.
The graphics is just astounding. Those guys have got talent! Real talent!

Last week, President Obama included USC on the President’s Higher Education Community Service honor roll, along with 700 other universities.
This honor validates the unique quality of USC that President Sample envisioned in his 1991 inaugural address: USC is a university where boundaries between student life and the local community life are blurred.
The university prides itself on this community bond, and its the reason we haven’t taken advantage of the numerous opportunities USC has had to move its campus elsewhere. We constantly interact with community members on our campus, at the University Village and along the Figueroa Corridor at local businesses.
Unfortunately, the Master Plan will naturally displace community members and organizations by harming local businesses and raising land prices, thus potentially hindering our strong community bond.
As of the 1999 census, the average West Adams neighborhood household income was $17,923 — approximately 15 percent greater than 1989 numbers. Since the 2009 numbers have yet to be counted, a generous growth of 15 percent from 1999 would give an estimated average household income of $20,611, making it one of the poorest neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. With this sort of income, households around campus are ripe for displacement if we do not invest in the economic development of the area.
The plan has goals to improve the “character” of the university and community by enhancing its park-like feel, acting as a catalyst to community investment and augmenting neighborhood safety for students, children and families.
A primary concern of USC’s at the moment is to provide housing for students to prevent the further displacement of local residents as student housing demands rise. We leave university housing in our second or third years and move into houses and apartments that would otherwise house locals. We can often pay more for the rent, thus prices go up and locals leave.
To help reduce the number of locals who are priced out by students seeking housing, USC pushed for the development of the luxurious, self-sustaining University Gateway Apartments. But student housing developments, like University Gateway, prevent students from interacting with the community. In a building where students can do their shopping, eating, studying and even entertaining on the premises, the only incentive to leave would be to attend class.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
If USC wants all of its students out of local housing and in housing designed for students, this would greatly harm the bonds the student body has developed with the community from living in close proximity.
The Master Plan also intends to knock down the UV to provide even more housing and better shopping and eating options. The discussions have included a potential grocery store like Trader Joe’s for middle-class students. Possible prices in the new UV might be higher and unattainable for residents, creating an unwelcoming environment for locals and again hindering the bond between USC and its neighborhood.
Though USC does a great job encouraging surrounding businesses to hire local residents, the UV development would not be as inviting as the food court or Superior Grocers, which provide many jobs and retail options for locals.
As USC enhances the “character” of campus and surrounding areas with more green, park-like facilities, beautiful architecture, greater shopping alternatives and environmentally conscious buildings, land value will increase. Landowners will then either sell their properties to match the higher market prices.
A rent increase will hurt locals that do not own land, forcing them to move. Those that own land will have a greater incentive to sell it and move. These area “improvements” result in the displacement of our community members.
The Master Plan has great intentions for the community and will have many benefits for students. But considering the natural, unintended result of displacement, we ought to step back and consider the big picture implications of the plan.
One of the greatest characteristics of USC is that students leave their respective bubbles and enter an environment reflective of much of the rest of the world. This area builds our character and increases our concern or kindness toward people in general. Another Westwood bubble right here would be disgusting.
Many of USC’s presidents have chosen not to pack up our campus and leave, but instead to benefit the community and build the character of students. Unfortunately, it seems instead we might keep our campus here and pack up the surrounding area, telling it to leave.
For our sake, and for our neighbors’ sakes, we should want to preserve our tight-knit relationship with our community. In this plan, USC should focus on keeping the student-local bond. It should invest in local businesses and economic development, increasing the local average household income. We have a great “good neighbors” policy, investing in people and children. But let’s raise the standard of living for our resident neighbors.
Jensen Carlsen is a senior majoring in economics and mathematics.  His column “The Bridge” runs Wednesdays.
Great article. How unfortunate that most of the comments here don’t go beyond vulgar chauvinism, slandering of the community, and barely concealed racist contempt.
Jensen- I believe you make many of your points in this article because you think they are the “right things to say”.  While well written, if you truly look into the details, your argument has many flaws, and you also fail to provide a viable alternative to the proposed changes.
First and foremost, USC should have a strong bond with the surrounding community as it is mutually beneficial to each party.  This can be (and has been) accomplished a number of ways, but USC should NOT make the surrounding community’s household income and shopping options it’s number one priority with respect to how the Master Plan is laid out.  
The school can NOT be held responsible for the community members’ skills and training and their ability to earn a living- imagining as such is completely idealistic.  Remember, while USC is a philanthropic university, its role is not to be a source of charity to the community.  The school and community can live together and help one another, but neglecting the students’ needs and leaving everything the same avoids change- the one thing that we all know is inevitable and beneficial to the community.
Leaving the UV the way it is would NOT benefit the community.  The jobs currently in place there will be replaced by other jobs with the businesses that replace the current businesses.  Theoretically, the salaries could actually improve, but they most certainly will not decrease.  As another poster noted, if there is demand for less expensive shopping options from the community, someone will take advantage of that demand and open other stores that cater to those demands.  This is simple capatalist economics and it is the way that our country works, for better and for worse.
Additionally, you make contradicting arguments about housing.  You suggest that our students push up the price of housing in the community, and push community members out, by paying higher rent for the available housing.  Presumably a solution for this would be to provide a greater supply of housing for students.  A giant student housing facility (University Gateway) has been built on a former car lot (not displacing any housing) and you complain about the type of housing because it supplies many conveniences for the students.  To me, it seems as though this is a step in the right direction- the private developer provided more student housing and will include conveniences that students asked for.
You also complain about the price of land appreciating.  Aside from this being another basic law of supply and demand that you can’t fight even if you wanted to, you neglect to take notice of the community members who DO own property in the area and will most certainly benefit from the real estate prices appreciating.  While this may be a small number of community residents, it should not be overlooked.
Finally, you also need to keep in mind that the school has been in this location since 1880.  The neighborhood has made many transitions over the past 130 years.  West Adams used to be one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Los Angeles, but that has changed.  While USC most certainly needs to continue to be a good neighbor, like any university should, it also has to keep its priorities in line and encourage improvement and change to the neighborhood that is good for its students.  Creating more retail options in the surrounding neighborhood of USC will only help the school, and since the school is the anchor of the community, then what is good for the school will most certainly benefit the community on the whole.
Why is the “community” always defined as lower class, poor people? I have lived next to USC,
during my time at USC and now that I have graduated, I have chosen to stick around around the area. Aren’t
I a community member as well? I feel that the Master Plan is an awesome push in the right direction, because it will benefit students in the long run. It is a ridiculous notion to not move forward and progress because some people may be indirectly affected by it. If and when I get priced out of the area surrounding USC, I will simply move. It’s called capitalism and more importantly real life. I would rather see some people benefit, (namely students) by the master plan, then to do nothing, and have nobody benefit at all.
There are several things about this article that I wold like to address:
“But student housing developments, like University Gateway, prevent students from interacting with the community.” 
I have lived in community housing for the past two years and feel that I have no more community involvement than when I lived in school housing besides skateboarding home at night and feeling scared. JEP however offered a real opportunity to interact with and support the community. You should consider encouraging community involvement programs like JEP that have direct and measurable benefits for the community rather than simply living in the community if community involvement is your main concern?
“In this plan, USC should focus on keeping the student-local bond. It should invest in local businesses and economic development, increasing the local average household income.”
This statement seems to contradict the idea of a new UV, what sort of economic development do you propose besides adding business that appeal to students and therefore have a higher earning potential? And how do you propose that USC goes about increasing the local average income besides adding businesses that can afford to pay their employees better? Maybe replacing Superior with Trader Joe’s would reduce the shopping opportunities for locals, but I don’t know that it would reduce the number of jobs available for local residents. Trader Joe’s could offer the same number of jobs to local employees and would likely offer better pay, as would the rest of the business establishments that replaced the UV. Would that not increase the average local income?
Maybe an “economic bubble” would draw a firmer line between USC and it’s students but a corresponding increase in community outreach initiatives, for instance one semester of mandatory JEP for all students, and new businesses that offer higher pay would certainly offer a lot to the community, preserving our strong community ties. In addition, I am not saying that “economic bubble” would necessarily be a good thing, but economic disparity, especially one so drastic as that between the local community and the average USC student, is highly correlated with crime. It is possible that such a bubble would significantly reduce the amount of crime that occurs around USC, which is essentially my only complaint about my time at USC, that I do not feel safe off campus because of the high incidence of crimes committed against students.
In conclusion, I agree that less community involvement would be a step in the wrong direction for USC, but I don’t think living within the community is a way to solve it. I think USC, it’s students and the community would benefit more from community service and outreach programs than from living within the community. I also believe that development of the north university park area would both stimulate the local economy by offering better paying jobs and please students by offering more places around campus to shop, eat, and find entertainment, something that most student drive far off campus to obtain at present.
I can somewhat emphatize with Justin and Xavier, and it’s because of the DPS statistics of how some denizens of 90007 target USC students as robbery opportunities, and sometimes violence. I also agree with Marc that the social outreach with the surrounding neighborhood saved us from destruction during the 1992 riots. Pepperdine was badly damaged during the Watts Riots decades ago; and perhaps it’s because that school was aloof towards the denizens of the surrounding community. USC decided not to white-flight it out 90007 after the ’92 riots, despite some alumni imploring President Sample to move to former Marine Corps base El Toro, CA. 
You see people, there are hypocrites (I’m not acting sarcastic) across town at Westwood, who preach tolerance, understanding, egalitarian ideals, anti-racism, etc.  yet they’re the same ones who jeer at USC for being in the “ghetto.” The difference is, we ACT on what we stand for, and others feign it. 
…now can we at least get an In ‘n Out built over here? that’s one thing I envy about Westwood!
Gee, I truly hope the two ignorant and narrow minded comments above didn’t come from USC students.  I thought perspectives had broadened considerably since I graduated in 1984.   First thing to understand, Justin and Xavier, is the University’s status is indirectly enhanced by it’s relationship with the neighboring community.  What’s more, less you forget, it was the community’s general well regard for the campus that saved it from destruction during the 1992 riots.
The primary concerns of the University should be to educate the students and to provide STUDENTS with a nice safe place to live. Talk of revitalizing the area and providing alternate housing for poor members of the community should not be a concern of the University.  
Too much concern over who gets offended because we build a Trader Joe’s, or because we build a 500 unit student housing building will only hinder our progress. 
The growth of USC is simple capitalism and market competition. Hindering it only hurts the University in the long run.
Since when is it the University’s goal to put community members ahead of its own students in regards to campus? If USC wants to attract better and brighter students, it must provide certain comparable amenities. Currently, USC has very little to offer outside its own walls. Its time to expand. While that means community members could be displaced, it also leaves open a door for the community to open its own grocery store. If there is a void, a business will come in and fill it.
USC doesn’t exist to furnish the surrounding community, it exists to educate its students and in doing so it exists to provide for it’s students needs.

USC’s Marshall School of Business dropped three spots in this year’s Bloomberg BusinessWeek standings, taking the 24th spot in top undergraduate business programs nationwide.
The fifth annual ranking surveyed senior business majors and corporate recruiters on a number of points to find the best program. Marshall placed 47th based on the survey of seniors and 34th based on the survey of recruiters.
USC Marshall’s greatest strength, according to BusinessWeek, is job placement services. The school’s median starting salary came in at $55,000, matching No. 1 ranked Notre Dame.
Of other California schools, U.C. Berkeley held onto its sixth place spot, while the University of San Diego and Santa Clara University trailed in 28th and 39th place respectively.
I wish…”USC Marshall’s greatest strength, according to BusinessWeek, is job placement services. The school’s median starting salary came in at $55,000, matching No. 1 ranked Notre Dame.”

USC sophomore guard Ashley Corral was named the final Pac-10 women’s basketball player of the week for the season Monday, the first Woman of Troy to be given this honor on this year.
Corral’s performances in USC’s crucial late-season games helped the Women of Troy finish with a five-game winning streak and secure the third seed in this week’s Pac-10 women’s basketball tournament.
The sophomore guard’s clutch late free throws during the games against Arizona and Arizona State also helped her win USC’s 38th all-time women’s player of the week honor from the conference. The award is Corral’s first-career Pac-10 player of the week honor.
Corral averaged 14.5 points and 2.5 rebounds in the two victories against the Arizona schools, which helped the Women of Troy enter the Pac-10 tournament with their highest seed since 2004.
The Women of Troy will play in the 10-team conference tournament on Thursday against sixth-seeded Oregon.

Department of Public Safety Chief Carey Drayton said he has high hopes for the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center. He thinks the building’s opening in the fall will begin to solve several problems that have been resolved unsuccessfully by the university over the past years.
Long-time residents of the North University Park area have complained about the noise, trash and safety issues that arise from parties at nearby fraternities on The Row and the massive number of students that accompany such events. Late-night on-campus events of the same magnitude are few and far between.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
In an effort to curb the problem, USC added tram service to L.A. Live last fall. But the addition of the limited service has not been enough to quell overcrowding issues on The Row.
Many other students have been left out of the mix altogether. As Drayton points out, not every 18-year-old wants to get drunk at fraternity parties on a weekly basis. But, most everyone does have a need for some social outlet.
The campus center is that other option.
First, the university must present food options that extend past the 10 p.m. closing times of the campus’ two dining halls. Sara Escalante had it right in last week’s Daily Trojan (“Weekend dining is food for thought”). The campus becomes barren on weekends because there is nothing to entice students to stay in the area. The problem is exacerbated at nighttime.
An establishment open late at night would give students an all-night-long option for something fresh, instead of the prepackaged, microwavable goods hawked by Trojan Grounds and drive at least a few more students onto campus, especially Thursdays through Sundays.
For instance, Stanford University’s Axe & Palm Café, which serves breakfast to-go or made-warm-to-order, is open until 2 a.m.
Second, USC must commit to making the funding necessary to bring high-quality acts, concerts and events to the area in front of the campus center and its ground floor multi-purpose room available.
With the exception of Welcome Week and Conquest, the Greek system currently has a dominant hold on social life at USC. The university should bolster its agenda of large, late-night social functions as Drayton vows it will.
USC will have to go leaps and bounds to attract a serious number of people who appreciate the new entertainment option. But in the end, competition drives innovation, and that means students should come out winners.
Drayton, for one, is not too worried. He thinks changing the culture at a university is a fairly easy process because the population changes every four years. Inculcate a class of freshman to believe that the center of campus is the place to be at night for entertainment and more will be the wiser. In four years, the entire student population will be on the same wavelength.
The debate ensues as to whether USC’s culture of partying is giving way to a culture focused on academic prowess. Whether or not that is the case, students will always need some form of social expression to release the energies pent up after a day of class.
USC prides itself on its diversity, which includes a diversity of choices when students come here. USC will only get better by attracting even more students to engage in new experiences by providing high-quality all-night dining and actively producing successful social events at the new campus center.

Prospective, I wouldn’t worry too much about Loner. What you have in the Greek scene is basically a continuation of high school social dynamics — rich and good-looking people who spend a lot of money to make themselves appear to be having a good time, and look down upon those who don’t fit in. If you’re not a member of that group, then the effect it has on you really depends on how you approach it. Some people, like Loner, are insecure about themselves and desperately want “in”, so they feel like the whole campus is mocking them. Others, more confident in their own identities, couldn’t care in the least. University is utterly unlike high school. Being intelligent does not stigmatize you, and being constantly drunk does not make you “cool”. If you want to be a Greek, enjoy it! If you don’t, then just learn to laugh at them. There are dozens if not hundreds of other social scenes at USC.
^^Agreed. :)
There is an incredibly vibrant social life at USC that has absolutely nothing to do with the Greek system. There are ALWAYS events going on at USC. On any given night, you could find 3 different student group-sponsored events going on.
There is no such thing as “the cool kids” at a school of 17,000+ students. The notion is ridiculous.
Find what you love and stick with it. I am absolutely thrilled to be at USC because I have found the people I love to be with–fellow activists, intellectuals, artists, musicians, student leaders, etc. The people I work with everyday have helped to enrich my life. And I have never felt like I was “missing out” by not going out to the Row to get wasted. That lifestyle has never, and will never, appeal to me.
:)
Is ‘Loner’ the average non-rich USC student? I’m a prospective student and thought that most people looked really happy at USC while I visited for Explore USC. Also, isn’t USC a good school? What do you mean, ‘party culture’?
Loner, it sounds like you need to place your focus on other aspects of your own social life than your exclusion from the Greek system.  There are lots of people at SC who aren’t rich or good looking and have rich social experiences, either in or outside the Greek system.  It sounds like you might need some counseling.  
Trojan_Anonymous, I personally don’t believe that the with the Tutor Center USC wants to or should attempt to diminish Row social life.  The introduction of the Center on campus though provides new and viable alternatives for students on campus to participation in Greek life off campus.  It’s a beautiful thing.  Enjoy it.
Loner,
Every walk of life comes together at Traddies!
Let me buy you a beer!
or a hug?
There is absolutely no way that the introduction of the Tutor Center to campus is going to diminish Row social life over the 4 years after it opens
“The debate ensues as to whether USC’s culture of partying is giving way to a culture focused on academic prowess.” 
I thought USC was making fervid attempts at nerdifying itself by the means of attracting foreign students who are inept in English but geniuses in math; atrracting bright high school potentials from all over the country (not just Cali); having 1 Nobel Laureate, George Olah, while UCLA and Cal’s got like more than a dozen combined, yada yada yada. 
The Greek org’s here ostracize you more cruelly than other major colleges in S. Cali. You’re either one of them, or you ain’t shieet. If you’re not good-looking, rich, or aren’t seen with the”right” crowd, then you’re not gonna make it here at ‘SC. You might as well bury yourself in the books and focus on upping your GPA so that you can get into a better grad school than ‘SC. 
A new infrustructural hangout isn’t going to mitigate the problem of “selective social interaction.” These are the games we play in life. If you lack social clout, then you’re a pariah.

Though the Los Angeles Unified School District currently faces steep budget cuts and staff layoffs, they are continuing their commitment to a three-year-old environmental program that has actually helped soften the financial blow.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the Green LAUSD Resolution, passed in 2007, outlined specific goals for water and energy conservation. The main points of the resolution include reducing emissions, water and energy use by 10 percent by 2013.
Already the program has helped the district save money on utility costs and LAUSD plans to continue its work to go green.
This month, LAUSD will upgrade hundreds of old schools buses to newer models. These new buses run off propane and are less polluting and more energy efficient.
“Our mission is to be the greenest school district in the country,” said L.A. Board of Education President Monica Garcia to the Times. “It’s good for the students, good for the planet, good for the neighborhoods.”
Such reforms are made possible with approved bond measures, utility incentives and grants. $120 million in federal bonds may also be available for LAUSD for solar energy projects.
A 2008 National Research Council report on green schools also found that many qualities of energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings also aid in student learning. Among the factors cited are the noise reduction afforded by insulated walls and double-pane windows, and the reduction of reparatory problems by not using volatile organic compounds. Such respiratory problems, including asthma, are the number one cause of absenteeism in schools.
Jay Gonzales, an adviser in LAUSD’s Office of Curriculum and Instruction, plans to get students involved in going green as well. This spring, he will pilot a project that will use students to devise more water efficient irrigation systems.
“LAUSD’s mandate is to educate, so everything we do should somehow be connected,” Gonzales told the Times.

Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott announced Monday that USC’s Nikola Vucevic has been named the Pac-10 Conference Most Improved Player of the Year for basketball.
After a modest freshmen year where he averaged only 2.6 points and 2.7 rebounds a game, the sophomore forward started in all 30 games of his second year where he averaged 10.7 points and lead the Pac-10 with 9.4 rebounds a game.
Vucevic was a force on the defensive side of the floor as well where he recorded 1.3 blocks per game (6th in the Pac-10), which was enough to be given an honorable mention on the Pac-10 All-Defensive team.
In addition to these honors, the Serbian-Montenegro native was also named to the All-Pac-10 Second Team after shooting 50.4 percent from the field and recording 10 double-doubles during the season.
Vucevic was a bright spot for the Trojan basketball team in a season where USC implemented self-imposed sanctions on its own team for violating NCAA rules relating to former Trojan and current NBA player O.J. Mayo.
The team received a one-year ban from postseason competition, a loss of one scholarship, a reduction of one  coach permitted to recruit during the summer of 2010, and a cut in the total number of recruiting days by 20 days for the 2010-2011 academic year.
Other Trojans honored in the Pac-10 awards were senior guard Dwight Lewis and senior forward Marcus Johnson.
Dwight Lewis earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention while Marcus Johnson made All-Defensive team honorable mention, respectively.

Rosie Sanchez left her home in Mexico in search of the American dream more than 25 years ago.
But on Dec. 8, 1985, she was arrested for murder. She was convicted two years later and has remained in prison ever since. Sanchez has maintained her innocence.
Happy family · Rosie Sanchez, pictured her with her four children about 25 years ago, was convicted of murder in 1985, but a USC student is working for her release. - Photo courtesy of the Gould School of Law
Now, Jennifer Farrell, a second-year law student at the USC Gould School of Law, is working to restore her freedom.
“Five people provided an alibi for her that night,” Farrell said. “There’s no way she could have done it. It was a false conviction.”
Farrell was assigned Sanchez’s case through the Post-Conviction Justice Project, a clinical program at Gould that works to defend the legal rights of convicted prisoners. The project provides hands-on experience for its 16 enrolled students, who speak with inmates, prepare written submissions and defend their clients at parole hearings.
“It’s been a really eye-opening experience,” Farrell said. “I’ve learned the justice system isn’t perfect by any means.”
A single mother of four, Sanchez owned a store in the garment district in Downtown Los Angeles. When a nearby rival shop burned down and a person who was sleeping inside died as a result, Sanchez was accused of setting the fire intentionally.
Sanchez was convicted by the jury, which was convinced by the testimony of a teenage boy who said he saw her fleeing the scene of the crime that night. The witness, however, changed his testimony three times.
Farrell, however, believes Sanchez was poorly represented, leading to a wrongful conviction.
“She spoke no English,” Farrell said. “Her court-appointed defender didn’t even try to make a case. He didn’t bring out her tax records, which showed that she had no financial motivation, and he only used one witness, whose testimony was thrown out because she was Rosie’s sister.”
Sanchez was sent to the California Institution for Women, where she has since worked as a translator, counselor and clerk. She sells crafts to support her four children, and she saved her roommate’s life when she tried to commit suicide in 2008, Farrell said.
“She deserves to be released,” Farrell said. “Even in her situation, she’s been involved in raising her kids, and she’s done so much to help her community.”
Farrell began working with Sanchez in August 2009 and represented her in front of the California Board of Parole Hearings in October. The board found her suitable for parole for the first time at that October hearing — a major victory after years of failed appeal attempts.
Now, because all Californian parole hearings are subject to gubernatorial review, the case is in the hands of Governor Schwarzenegger.
“The last hurdle is to have him uphold the parole board’s decision, and he often reverses,” said Heidi Rummel, clinical associate professor of law at Gould and directing attorney for PCJP. “We’re trying to educate the public about her case and the system in general, so they can send in letters of support to the governor.”
Schwarzenegger’s decision will be announced either Friday, March 12 or Monday, March 15.
If the decision is upheld, Sanchez will return to Mexico as stipulated by the conditions of her release. Her children will join her there.
“If he reverses, then we head back to court,” Farrell said.
Historically, less than a quarter of all parole approvals have been confirmed.
Gus Sanchez, Rosie’s son, said the family is anxiously awaiting the governor’s decision.
“It’s been hard,” he said. “She’s not bitter about the situation. She always told us she was going to use her time in a positive way.”
According to her son, Sanchez is especially grateful for the help of the PCJP.
“She says she’s surprised how a student has done so much when she paid lawyers in the past,” he said of his mother. “All that money, and nothing was even close to what Jenny has done for us. Right now — this is the closest we’ve ever been to her release.”
Parole?  This case should be retried!  The woman is wrongfully convicted and the best she can hope for is to be deported back to Mexico without the state ever admitting that she is innocent.

A recent survey by the USC Alumni Association found that graduates are becoming increasingly more satisfied with their college and alumni experience, though there are still improvements to be made.
The USC Alumni Association conducted an online survey in the fall of 2009 to evaluate alumni involvement and college experience, including factors such as alumni attitudes and behaviors. Though the results of the 2009 survey illustrated significant gains in certain areas, the Alumni Association realizes it still has areas that need to improve.
“There has been a tremendous progress in various areas, including career services and the Trojan Network,” said Cheryl Collier, director of communications and marketing for the USC Alumni Association.
Collier said 7,441 alumni participated in the online survey, which consisted of questions divided into four areas: demographics, student experience, alumni experience and loyalty. Questions surveyed involvement on campus, student commitment to education and overall preparation to receive a college degree. The main objective, Collier said, is to help determine how USC is viewed by previous generations of Trojans.
The results have improved over the years, with an overwhelming 95 percent of alumni reporting in this year’s survey that their overall experience at USC was satisfying and successful.
Many alumni said they were not surprised by this statistic.
“I definitely loved my experience at USC and being a Trojan for life,” alumna Trina Saunders said.
Still, the Alumni Association sees room for improvement. Based on the fact that most of the respondents were older, Collier said the Alumni Association plans to focus more efforts on targeting young alumni.
“In 2007, we needed to improve in career services and made significant gains after we developed our alumni services study group,” Collier said. “We now plan to dedicate more resources to the area of social media.”
Collier said the Alumni Association will also work on developing a relationship with Trojans before they graduate.
“We have the opportunity to enhance the affinity of undergraduates by associating with undergraduate organizations and community services. It’s mainly about working together with the students,” she said.
One example of an undergraduate organization that works in forming the relationship between undergraduate students and alumni is Society 53. Members of the society are the student liasons between alumni and students. Their goal is to have students’ first exposure to the alumni network be right after graduation.
USC alumna Syreeta Greene Aboubaker was one of the many alumni who completed the survey, and she said she agrees that a stronger connection with younger alumni and students would be a great improvement.
“I definitely could have benefitted from more advisement from the association as a student,” she said.
Though USC Alumni are greatly satisfied by their experience at USC and have received the adequate attention and education to receive a college degree and a promising career, the Alumni Association plans to continue distribution of the survey every two years to improve its operation.

On the heels of the Undergraduate Student Government elections, the candidates for the Graduate and Professional Student Senate are kicking their campaigns into high gear.
There are three candidates running for GPSS president this year: Edward Ng, a first-year graduate student studying public policy and urban planning; Jenny Novak, a second-year graduate student studying geography; and Juanita Price, a first-year graduate student studying education.
The GPSS election differs from the USG election in that the senators, not the student body, choose the candidates. GPSS has about 60 senators representing the different graduate departments; senators will vote during the March Senate meeting.
There are far fewer GPSS candidates this year, according to Abhinav Chandran, public relations chair for GPSS. Chandran said typically there have been as many as six or more candidates for each position, but this year GPSS changed its rules. Now, candidates must have prior GPSS experience to run for a position.
Of the candidates, Novak has the most GPSS experience. Last year, she served as a senator for the geography department, and this year she is working as the Campus Affairs Chair.
Novak said the relationships she has formed with administrators during her two years with GPSS make her a qualified candidate for president.
“I have been going to a lot of meetings, and I’m developing a lot of relationships that will be well-suited to the presidency,” she said.
Though Price has only been at USC for one year, she has experience working in student government at two other schools in addition to USC.
“I have a passion for advocacy and for education, and I’ve been doing this since community college,” Price said. “I offer something that the other candidates don’t offer; I offer the experience of coming through three different institutions, and I have a larger viewpoint of what it means to be the voice of a student.”
Currently the finance chair for GPSS, Price worked in student government both at UC Riverside, where she earned her undergraduate degree, and at community college.
Ng, who currently serves as a chair for the LGBT and Allies committee for GPSS, worked as the University Affairs Committee Chairperson in the student government and served as president of the Residence Hall Association at Rutgers University, where he completed his undergraduate studies. He said he believes that experience has helped make him a strong leader.
“That experience lends itself very well in GPSS because one of our chief things to do is to advocate,” Ng said. “I have this outside experience. I can combine that with my experience at USC and create newer innovative ideas and approaches to challenges we face on campus.”
Ng said the most important issues he wants to address are the Metro Transportation Authority TAP card program and housing, noting that he also intends to be flexible in his approach.
“A GPSS president needs to be flexible in learning about what the student population wants and needs and adapting to these needs,” he said.
Ng is stressing his organizational skills and commitment in his campaign for the presidency.
“I have a strong commitment to ensuring that information is available,” Ng said. “If you look at my committee web page, I make it a point to say that I update this every week, on Thursday at 3 p.m. And I always make sure I do so.”
Like Ng, Novak also intends to focus on the MTA TAP card program and housing if elected. Another key issue she sees, however, is GPSS publicity.
“I want to see GPSS as a household name across campus [because] it seems like a lot of students come in and don’t know about GPSS,” she said.
She added that she is willing to work on the long-term planning that will lead to great things she might not necessarily be here to see.
Price said the problems she intends to tackle if elected include implementing tax-exempt stipends for graduate student jobs and improving transportation.
“One thing that’s very important is this whole issue on transportation — working with the executive board and the senate to make sure we get the TAP card. It would help the professional students be able to move around and get home,” she said.
Price said she also wants to work more closely with senators to link the senate and the executive board.
Campaigning for the president of GPSS began last week. Candidates are currently meeting with senators and passing out fliers, and elections will be held March 29.

Ralph Fertig, an 80-year-old USC professor who has devoted much of his life to advancing civil rights causes, does not fit the profile of a terrorist.
But that is the charge Fertig, a professor of social welfare at USC’s School of Social Work, could be facing if he loses the recent appeal he argued in the U.S. Supreme Court last week.
Fertig is challenging the interpretation of an anti-terrorism law that prohibits advising terrorist groups. Since visiting Kurdistan, Turkey, in the 1980s and seeing the denial of human rights there, Fertig has been counseling Kurds on how to bring their case to the United Nations. Some of those he has advised, however, are suspected members of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK), a group designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department.
Fertig said his intention was never to be a part of terrorism but to help PKK work toward a peaceful solution.
“The intent has to be to help a terrorist organization, and my intent is to help the Kurds,” Fertig said. “The advice I am giving is to observe peaceful and lawful resolution of the conflict.”
In 1998, Fertig filed for an injunction in the U.S. District Court of Los Angeles, looking for protection from the government for his work.
The federal government later appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but the panel upheld the injunction.
The law has been revised four times since, so Fertig has had to file four injunctions, each one appealed by the federal government.
In the most recent instance, the federal government appealed to the Supreme Court to have the injunction voided, saying it violated new provisions of the Patriot Act, which makes it illegal to give service, expert advice, personnel and training to groups classified as terrorist organizations.
It is that recent appeal, though, that led Fertig and the Humanitarian Law Project, a group that Fertig heads, to the Supreme Court last week.
“I have a deep and abiding belief in the right to free speech,” Fertig said. “The Kurds are being oppressed in Turkey, and this is an effort to silence me. Politically, our country is doing this to silence me and others who speak out against this because we want to be friends with Turkey.”
It is not the first time Fertig has fought for free speech and human rights.
Born to German immigrants and raised in Chicago, Fertig said working to advance civil rights was his natural calling, as he was exposed to many forms of discrimination early on in his life. His family’s home became a refuge for Jews fleeing Nazi persecution during World War II.
“I grew up learning about the atrocities that Hitler was committing against the Jews, and I swore I would devote my life to preventing such atrocities,” he said.
While earning a bachelor’s degree at the University of Chicago, he became vice president for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
After graduating in 1950, he earned his master’s at Columbia University in 1952 and his doctorate in sociology at the University of Chicago in 1955.
Fertig participated in the Freedom Riders Movement of 1961, an experience that almost cost him his life when he was taken off the bus in Selma, Ala. and jailed.
“They broke every rib in my body, and they were going to lynch me, but I was rescued by three black lawyers and the FBI,” Fertig said.
A close friend of Martin Luther King Jr., Fertig worked with him in the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and participated in the famous march on Washington, D.C. of 1963. Along with King Jr., he cites Paul Robeson as a major inspiration.
Fertig’s professional career consists of 25 years of working as a civil rights attorney, mostly in private practice in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and six years of working as a federal district judge.
“What we like about [Fertig] is that he is willing to take this personal risk to advance the things he believes in,” said Marilyn Flynn, dean of the School of Social Work. “He is certainly one of the most committed people that I know to human rights both in his personal life and his professional life.”
Locally, Fertig has advocated for the rights of homeless children in Los Angeles.
He presented legislation during a special hearing in Los Angeles last year to help pass a bill that would put homeless children in subsidized housing with their parents rather than in foster homes.
Fertig has worked with his students on the issue of homelessness, believing his students should be involved in framing policy.
Recently, a group of his students made a documentary about homelessness on skid row and presented it in various venues to help gain support for the bill.
Students involved in the project said Fertig’s stories of his fights for human rights helped motivate them and convinced them they could effect change.
“There are a lot of situations where it seemed like nothing could be done about a problem, [but] sharing these stories creates an environment in the classroom that we can go out there and make changes even if they seem impossible,” said Erin Dowler, one of the students who worked on the bill.
Fertig is now back in Los Angeles, awaiting a ruling on his Supreme Court appeal.
If the appeal fails and Fertig is charged and convicted, he could face up to 15 years in jail. Yet he is unfazed and committed to standing up for the oppressed and expressing his first-amendment right.
“My intention is to continue to provide free-speech advice to the Kurds to bring their cause to the U.N., and, if the government says that makes me a criminal, then they have to charge me, convict me and put me in jail.”
Hmmm… I wonder if I understand zeinep’s point. He seems to say that ignorance of right and wrong is not a good excuse for supporting evil. If so, I agree. The professor in the story is sort of saying, “it’s none of my concern that this is a terrorist group, I don’t know about that, I’m just here to provide legal advice, and doesn’t everybody deserve equal access to my services?” Like it’s his professional responsibility to disregard the evil his clients do, as if he were an ignoramus. He may be right, and I’ll be interested to hear SCOTUS’s decision on the matter, but it’s a pretty weak way for a human being to defend his immoral activities.
He’s MOST DANGEROUS. He’s MOST DANGEROUS. He is OPPORTUNIST.
It is nice to be the on the side of the  supress people.
But; to judge people from one point of view is equally unjustifiable…
Your behavior is more from the romantic than being a realistic person. 
This is very human… But being a scholar like yourself, this behaviour is not acceptable one…
Because of your ignorance of the situation, you being a part of the crime…
It’s unbeliavable…
Title is misleading.

President Barack Obama’s plan to reform student financial aid remains in limbo, but USC is planning to switch to direct lending — a move that would likely be required if the legislation is passed — regardless of what happens in Washington, D.C.
Under the current system, borrowers may choose either a bank-funded Federal Family Education Loan or a U.S. Treasury-funded Federal Direct Loan, depending on which program their school uses.
The Student Financial Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that passed the House of Representatives in September included provisions to eliminate FFEL and switch entirely to direct lending; the Senate version of the bill is expected to contain this requirement too.
The bill has stalled since moving to the Senate, but Katharine Harrington, USC’s dean of Admission and Financial Aid, said USC will switch to the direct lending program for next year.
“Due to the volatility of current credit markets, cuts in government subsidies and the uncertain future of pending legislation that may force a change in the nation’s student loan delivery system, the university is switching its participation from the Federal Family Education Loan Program to the Federal Direct Loan Program for the 2010-11 academic year,” Harrington wrote in an e-mail.
Harrington said the direct-lending program should simplify the loan process for students. Loans will come from the U.S. Treasury, which she said is a more stable funding source than many of the private banks and loan companies that have been hit hard by the economy.
The school has been working to prepare for this move for several months, Harrington said, and the system will be in place in time for the 2010-2011 school year.
“Although the change has created additional work, we are well positioned to complete it in the coming weeks,” Harrington wrote. “Both the university and our student borrowers will benefit from this move to the Federal Direct Loan Program.”
USC Credit Union Vice President Michael Kim said USCCU has loaned up to $130 million annually with only $30 million in assets but will revamp its loan program this summer because of financial uncertainty — officials are hoping to circumvent this exact problem with direct lending.
“We don’t want to offer something we can’t guarantee long term,” he said.
During the last three years, according to USA Today, about 550 colleges eliminated the FFEL program while the number of schools using direct lending doubled.
Though USC will switch to the direct-lending program one way or another, officials are still waiting to see action on SAFRA, which contains a number of other changes to financial-aid policies.
Beyond the switch to direct lending, SAFRA would change the maximum Pell Grant to one percent above the inflation rate, quadruple the Perkins Loan program, increase subsidies for historically black and minority-serving universities, provide loan forgiveness to military members active during school, and simplify the Free Application for Student Aid.
SAFRA would save more than $80 billion during the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. Department of Education can borrow money from the U.S. Treasury at about two percent interest — cheaper than private institutions.
By charging interest rates of up to 6.8 percent as set by Congress, the DOE reaps profits that would be used to increase Pell Grant awards to $5,550 in 2010 and to $6,900 by 2019.
Over the past few months, SAFRA has taken a back seat in the Senate as the health care bill stole the spotlight.
Senate Democrats are hoping to pass their version of the financial-aid bill using a special vote known as budget reconciliation, which requires approval by 51 votes instead of 60. As reconciliation can only be used once per session, and Democrats want to save it for health care reform legislation, the student-aid bill will have to wait.
Recently, however, government officials have begun to talk about the possibility of merging part of the health care bill with SAFRA, a move that would expedite the passage of what many consider to be a critical bill.
“We think making more aid available to students is important because it is essential in today’s economy to have more students go to college and graduate,” DOE spokesperson Jane Glickman said.
One obstacle SAFRA faces is opposition from lenders. Under SAFRA, the four lenders with government contracts — Sallie Mae, Great Lakes, Nelnet and PHEAA — would still handle support, billing, disclosures and payments once a student receives a loan.
According to Sallie Mae Vice President for Public Affairs Conwey Casillas, lenders support Obama’s plan but are advocating for two changes to the bill.
First, lenders want borrowers to be able to choose which lender services a loan, rather than having the lender chosen by the DOE. Under the current FFEL program, borrowers choose their own lender.
Another amendment proposed by lenders would penalize servicers 3 percent on loans defaulted by their borrowers. They say such a provision, which is also in FFEL, would align the interest of servicers with that of students and taxpayers.
“These enhancements allow for competition and choice, superior default prevention services and bipartisan support,” Casillas said.
The Senate has yet to adopt the lenders’ amendments because of the lenders’ insistence on receiving payments totaling nearly $13 billion over 10 years from the government for originating loans.
Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert and publisher of FinAid.org, said he expects the Senate to pass the bill in time for the changes to go into effect July 1, the last date colleges may adopt direct lending for the 2010-2011 academic year.
But co-director of USC’s Center for Urban Education Alicia Dowd said she fears the bill may fail as the health care bill has thus far.
“Obama’s plan to recycle money back into the system is a step in the right direction,” she said. “But my fear is the financial lobby will derail this bill. Students and families have to become aware and speak out against subsidies going to the banks and not the students.”
Just as there is only one budget bill passed per term, there is only one reconciliation bill tied to it.
http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/uh-oh-what-if-reconciliation-isnt-quick
What’s your source for the statement “reconciliation can only be used once per session”? I’d never heard this before, so I googled it, and the first thing that came up was… this article. That suggests to me, though it doesn’t prove, that the statement may be erroneous. Surely, if it were true, it would be widely reported in articles about the health care debate. Anyway, I don’t know for certainly if it’s true of false, but I just wanted to suggest you double-check this fact.

For celebrity newcomers, nothing cements their place in Hollywood as much as a successful debut at the Academy Awards. And aside from going home with a golden statue, the best way for actresses to ensure that success is to don a memorable dress.
Amid the strapless necklines and ruffled confections of Sunday’s red carpet walks, the Oscars presented an unadventurous but glamorous slew of gowns that reinforced the ceremony as a conservative, low-key event.
Carey Mulligan, Gabourey Sidibe, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick were all nominated newcomers to watch, and viewers anxiously awaited their red carpet entrances to see what and who they would be wearing.
“It’s the most watched fashion parade in the world, way more so than fashion week, which is still a niche market and has a niche audience, relatively speaking,” said Elizabeth Currid, an assistant professor and author of The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art and Music Drive New York City.
With all the pressure on their afternoon entrances, the women didn’t disappoint. While their ensembles were star-worthy, they also didn’t shock — each actress chose traditionally glamorous, flowing, floor-length dresses.
“Every fashion choice impacts the impression people have of you,” said Daniel Durbin, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism who teaches a course called Fashion, Media and Culture (COMM 396).
“The younger actresses were in very, generally elegant, generally pretty conservative, often very ruffled and laced looking outfits, placing you in a comfortable space for the audience — not challenging the audience or threatening them. As a newcomer, that is a valuable place to be because you are asking these people to end up buying tickets to your movies,” he said.
Carey Mulligan’s strapless Prada dress with its Swarovski beaded bodice was a quirky and perfect choice for the actress nominated for her lead performance in An Education. The pixie-cut blonde has made eight out of the last 10 of Vogue’s Ten Best Dressed lists, wearing demure and sophisticated styles uncharacteristic of actors her age and reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.
Wearing an empire-waisted, flower-adorned blue Marchesa gown, Gabourey Sidibe said of her look, “If fashion were porn, this dress is the money shot.” The actress nominated for her lead performance in Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire radiated with excitement, and her ruched dress didn’t disappoint in her Cinderella moment.
Vera Farmiga, nominated for her supporting role in Up in the Air, also donned Marchesa with a dress that fully embodied designer Georgina Chapman’s signature embellished romantic style. Farmiga’s strapless column dress featured dramatic cascading pleated ruffles that embodied the glamour of old Hollywood.
“That one was like an endless flower,” Durbin said.
Most ordinary of the bunch was Anna Kendrick, whose Elie Saab Haute Couture blush gown with frilled drapery weighed her down and washed her out. The actress nominated for a supporting role in Up in the Air was pretty and didn’t look bad by any means, but was the least memorable of the four neophytes.
While the choice didn’t harm her reputation, it also didn’t set her apart as a risk-taker, but as a newly famous actress, that’s not something you necessarily want to be.
“For the new up-and-comers, it’s their foray into this world and it’s probably better to just be observed as being pretty and having a pretty dress than to be judged,” Currid said.
While there are many factors that determine what dress a particular celebrity wears — relationships they might have with stylists or designers, for example — the endless critiques that follow the ceremony are definitely a factor to consider in the decision-making process.
“Why wouldn’t you just wear the dress that made you look good rather than wearing something that might get made fun of?” Currid said.
“The only thing that really matters is that you don’t screw up,” Durbin added. “If you play it well and safe and wear something that is relatively conservative and caters to the international audience, it’s almost always a positive.”
By those standards, all four actresses won, even though none of them managed to snag the coveted award.
But with such promising young talent, this certainly won’t be anyone’s last Oscars appearance. As they rack up red carpet experience, hopefully they’ll become comfortable enough to take more risks.

Kathryn Bigelow’s Oscar win Sunday evening was unprecedented. Jeff Bridges’ win, however, was not.
Certainly for Bridges, a five-time Academy Award nominee, his Oscar victory for his performance in Crazy Heart is unprecedented — and long overdue — when considering his prolific film career. But this isn’t the first time an actor has garnered the coveted gold statue by portraying a musician.
Film and music have gone hand in hand since the early stages of moviemaking, when silent films frequently enhanced their soundless images with live accompaniment — a precursor to the elaborate scores now composed and orchestrated for everything from action-adventure flicks to intense dramas.
As technology developed and talkies, or sound films, came into existence in the late 1920s, music continued to play an integral role in Hollywood filmmaking. The earliest music videos date back to nearly 50 years before the inception of MTV, when singers would perform the popular songs of the era before a stagnant camera. And as moviemaking evolved, some of the most well-liked films during the ’30s and ’40s often featured lengthy song-and-dance numbers á la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
The trend of the large-scale Hollywood musical carried well into the ’50s with the beloved Singin’ in the Rain and Guys and Dolls, the ’60s with the Academy Award-winning West Side Story and The Sound of Music, and the ’70s with the Liza Minelli vehicle Cabaret. But the magic and power of song-and-dance storytelling seems to have fizzled out in the last 30 years.
Double threat · Jeff Bridges — seen here with director Scott Cooper — also portrayed a tortured musician in 1989’s The Fabulous Baker Boys. - Photo courtesy of Fox Searchlight 
Nowadays, flashy on-screen musicals generally flatline in theaters, as their glittering costumes and kick lines continually appear more exhausted than energetic. This is clearly evident in Rob Marshall’s latest Broadway revival, Nine, which opened last Christmas Day to meager box-office revenue and poor critical reviews.
But in the large-scale musical’s absence, Hollywood has witnessed the rise of the personal musician’s tale. Although considerably more intense and intimate than the typical musical’s shimmering flare, Hollywood’s newest way to pay homage to musicians teeters on the line between compelling and cliché.
Scott Cooper’s Crazy Heart, which is based on a novel of the same name, is the latest independent drama that details the amoral life frequently stereotyped when discussing musicians.
Although aging and possessing a hard-to-ignore beer belly, Bridges’ Bad Blake — who is said to be inspired by several rough-around-the-edges singer-songwriters such as Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings — is inexplicably endearing. A whiskey-loving country singer with a hard exterior and disregard for his deteriorating health, Blake is the epitome of washed up; it’s his apparent love for music, however, that keeps the audience rooting for him.  
No stranger to showing off his musical prowess on screen, Bridges starred as a gruff, chain-smoking, prodigious pianist condemned to playing in hotel lounges and stuffy restaurants with his less-talented brother (played by Bridges’ real-life sibling, Beau) in 1989’s The Fabulous Baker Boys. Akin to Crazy Heart, Bridges performed all of his own musical tricks and radiated that same down-and-out charm. Both characters had an enviable talent and a consuming desire to make something of their music careers and the evident failures that followed tainted both characters’ wills to live.
It’s exactly that quality — an obsession with creating that threatens all that is constant and balanced in a musician’s life — that attracts outsiders to these other-worldly artists.
This attraction was measured just two years ago at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony, where actress Marion Cotillard unexpectedly won the Oscar for her turn as iconic French singer Édith Piaf in the biopic La Vie en Rose. Like Bad Blake, Piaf’s life was plagued with affairs, addiction and tragedy, and it’s her unending suffering that not only drove the emotion behind Piaf’s voice but also the film’s narrative.
And in 2005, Joaquin Phoenix received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Johnny Cash, another country singer-songwriter with a drinking problem, in Walk the Line. Reese Witherspoon, in her role as June Carter, a popular country singer who forged a romantic relationship with the married Cash, took home the Oscar for her performance. Walk the Line, too, centered around Cash’s uncontrollable alcoholism and tumultuous affair with Carter that took a toll on both of their careers.
It’s hard to say what’s more alluring to an audience: the creative spark behind the artists’ work or the passion behind their personal lives. Part underdog story, part drug-induced diary entry, the plight of the musician, whether factual or fictional, is intriguing to those living comparably average lives.
Every musician portrayed onscreen provides us with a portrait hedonism, and, as viewers, it lets us indulge without consequences. But as moviegoers, what we truly desire to see by the film’s end credits is redemption.
While Piaf and Cash found very little redeemed at the end of their lives, any audiophile knows that Bridges’ Blake cleans up too easily to be reality.

Imagine a classical choir singing — in German — the story of Jesus’ crucifixion in the form of an operatic aria over the course of three hours. The average college student, accustomed to stimulating theatrical performances and sensational visual effects, would probably go crazy. But after hearing Grant Gershon, the director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, explain the emotion behind each note, the biblical narrative proved to be just as satisfying as some action-packed thrillers.
Passionate · The Los Angeles Master Chorale, Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra and members of a children’s choir brought the piece to life. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan
On Sunday night, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra and select members of the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus united to bring Bach’s timeless St. Matthew Passion to Downtown’s own Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Bach’s St. Matthew Passion is widely considered a masterpiece of classical music composition because of the visionary’s combination of intellectual rhetoric and emotional content.
St Matthew Passion is a musical retelling of chapters 26 and 27 in the book of Matthew, including everything from Jesus’ anointment to his burial and featuring the well-known biblical personages of Christ, Peter, Judas and Pilate.
It would be misleading to call the figures characters, however, because no acting was involved. Each figure stood from his position in the choir reading his lines with expressionless faces. The only exception came from the man who read the part of Jesus and the narrator who stood in front.
At first, the performance seemed dry and boring. There wasn’t any surprise twists or even movement onstage. The genius of St. Matthew Passion lies not in how the piece is performed but rather in how it is composed. The emotion is written into the composition, and audiences are forced to hear the beauty rather than see it. Attendees must hear the angst in Peter’s voice, not see it on his face, for instance, just as a piano is used to tell of Mary’s teardrops and a cello describes the funerary march that isn’t simply depicted with scenery and stage props.
Yet Bach’s ingenuity is not only clear in how he perfectly inscribed passion into every note but also how incredibly complex and intellectually stimulating his compositions are.
Within the performance, there are 68 individual movements and multiple arias and chorales performed by two choirs and two orchestras. Each choir has 20 singers, allowing for incredibly intimate moments, especially during the scenes concerning Judas’ infamous betrayal. Yet the group’s potential was also realized at different points, with everyone singing at once, making for some extraordinarily majestic and overwhelming moments.
The first choir represented faithfulness, and the second choir represented Zion itself. The children’s choir served as a beautiful counterpoint to it all, conjuring innocence and purity with their youthful voices. All the vocal performances were perfectly pitched and rhythmically in tune with the instruments.
It’s clear that Bach’s ageless compositions will continue to transcend generational divides for ages and will be widely enjoyed, especially now as musicians and fans gather to celebrate his 325th birthday on March 21.
At the end of the day the musicians can only present Bach’s music, however, and it’s up to the individual experiencing the music to appreciate it for what it’s worth.
While it’s not easy to let go of the visual and rely solely on auditory senses for three hours, doing so allows the listener to fully realize the genius of the composer and the excellence of the choirs and orchestras, which provide a deeper, richer and more dramatic experience.
A real missed opportunity with this article to note the contributions of current USC students who took place in this fantastic performance.  There were numerous such talents, both in the orchestra (Musica Angelica) and the Los Angeles Master Chorale who are USC current students and/or alumni.  Even Maestro Gershon is one such example.  A simple skimming of the program would have highlighted those notable soloists with previous affiliations to USC.  Once again…a real missed opportunity.

It’s almost impossible for fans of musicals to make it through their lives without seeing a production of Cats, either onstage or on screen.

The show has been around since 1981 and was one of Broadway’s longest running musicals. USC alumnae Jennifer Cohen (’05) and Aubrey Elson (’07) said they are having the time of their lives on a touring production of Cats that opens at Hollywood’s Pantages Theatre today.
“It’s a national production of Cats, and it’s the only production of Cats sanctioned by Andrew Lloyd Weber in the U.S.,” explained Cohen, who plays Jennyanydots in the touring production. “It’s the original choreography and staging from the original production.”
Although the two USC grads are enjoying their time on the tour, they weren’t always sure they had what it took to hold their own in a touring production of such a high-caliber musical.
“You have to have a strong backbone, and I wasn’t sure if I was emotionally going to be able to do it,” said Elson, who plays Sillabub. “It’s a hard lifestyle — it’s a gamble.”
Although the women have taken separate routes until this point, they’ve both been heavily involved in live theater since graduation.
Cohen’s professional experience after college consisted of teaching musical theater in Los Angeles and performing regionally. She earned a master’s degree in musical theater from Boston Conservatory in 2009 and landed a role in Cats that same year.
After graduating in 2007 from the USC School of Theatre, Elson said her  route could have veered in a number of ways. She was accepted into Teach For America but had to defer the offer in favor of another opportunity.
“Literally on the same day I got an offer to work under Dr. Leventhal at USC to do a show through Kelly Ward, who was my theater mentor at USC,” Elson said.
Elson realized she enjoyed professional theater.
“I started auditioning in Los Angeles, and I worked pretty consistently doing theater jobs, got an agent, served a little bit of time as a Starbucks barista and eventually booked Cats out of L.A.,” Elson said.
Both Cohen and Elson explained that the USC experience enriched their knowledge. While Cohen said she was focused primarily on classical music and opera in her time in the USC Thornton School of Music, Elson majored in theatre and minored in international relations. It is interesting that the two women are both touring in the same production of Cats despite their disparate majors.
In addition to studying singing, Cohen tried to branch out.
“I also got to be in the musicals [at USC] and be in the theatre classes, dance classes,” Cohen said.
Elson’s feelings about her USC experience were similar. While she was in the theater school, she took advantage of classes such as Musical Theatre Audition, while also participating in USC Dance Company productions.
“That helped with understanding how to put a story together and how to tell a story onstage,” Elson said. “There were a lot of little things that helped.”
Elson also said the class Advanced Movement for Actors specifically helped her with Cats, a show that is truly based on actors’ movement more than the mis-en-scene.
She said being able to partake in classes outside of her major was especially important for a show like Cats, which, although dance-heavy, requires almost equal strength in singing and acting.
“You have to be able to do all three,” Cohen said.
Elson described the Cats cast dynamic as being akin to “one big happy family.”
Touring is tough Elson said — sometimes the cast has to go straight to the theater without even getting to settle into a hotel first — but they rarely become frustrated with one another.
While a part of the cast, Cohen and Elson have been getting to see the world from one side to another.
“We were in South America for six weeks, and we’ve been to Chicago, Orlando, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and every little town in between,” Elson said.
The two USC grads are excited to have the opportunity to travel, but they’re both also ecstatic to be back in their mutual college town.
“When I found out we were performing at the Pantages, I cried,” Elson said. “I’m from Thousand Oaks, so I grew up going to Pantages shows, and never in a million years did I think I’d be in a show of that caliber.”
Cohen also admitted being a longtime fan of the Pantages Theatre, having seen shows at the Hollywood venue throughout her college career.
“To actually get to perform there and have my college friends and family, and hopefully some teachers come out to see it, it’s a pretty neat opportunity,” Cohen said.
While not performing, Cohen and Elson said they are just glad to be returning to the city itself.
“A lot of people in the cast have never been to Los Angeles,” Cohen said. “I can’t wait to show them around!”
While being in such a large musical is a dream come true, both women expressed that Cats is a particularly fun musical to be a part of. The show has had a traveling production on the road since 1985.
“People bring their children to see it, and then those children are affected by it,” Elson said.
“We call the show ‘Now and Forever,’” Cohen said. “It is such a timeless show and has something for all ages, and I think that people appreciate the music and appreciate the dance that goes into it … There’s something in it that everyone can enjoy.”
Cats is now playing at the Pantages Theatre through March 21.
Loved this article! Brought back wonderful memories of my past…I did three tours of “Hello Dolly” in the ’60s, and understand these young ladies’ current lives all too well.  All I can say to them is “Enjoy!!!”
