Students and faculty gathered Tuesday evening in the Wallis Annenberg Hall to watch the first Democratic presidential debate.
The event was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Political Student Assembly, and the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.
After the debate, Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, moderated a panel discussion featuring former California Assemblywoman Cindy Montañez of the 39th District, former California State Senator Tony Strickland of the 19th District, former president of USC College Democrats Alec White, and the Daily Trojan managing editor Yasmeen Serhan.

The Democratic debate, which was hosted by CNN, featured the following candidates: Hillary Clinton, frontrunner and former secretary of state; Bernie Sanders, junior Senator from Vermont; Martin O’Malley, former Maryland governor; Jim Webb, former Virginia Senator; and Governor Lincoln Chafee, former Rhode Island senator.
CNN’s Anderson Cooper moderated the debate along with Juan Carlos Lopez and Dana Bash, the latter of whom also moderated the second Republican primary debate.

“It’s good to see so many people here today,” said Montañez to the gathered crowd prior to the debate. “Democrats, Republicans, Independents, whatever your political party may be, it’s just great that you’re interested in finding out the different issues that all presidential candidates are talking about.”
Alexandra Schwartz, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she believes the democratic frontrunner can serve as commander in chief.
“I believe Hillary is very qualified to become president,” she said.
Rini Sampath, Undergraduate Student Government president, said she was pleased with the turnout and enjoyed hearing the different candidates speak.
“I personally was interested to see the different debate styles and how the candidates addressed their policies,” Sampath said. “I had a feeling that Bernie was going to have a very upfront, straightforward debate style. So I was really excited about seeing it all unfold this evening.”
Sampath added that she was impressed by Sanders, Clinton and O’Malley’s performance during the debate.

One marked difference between this debate and the second GOP debate was the lack of personal insults and verbal zings.
After the debate, the panel analyzed the performance of the candidates and answered questions from the audience.
“Quite frankly, I think Sanders won,” Strickland said. “I believe Clinton seemed angry and defensive.”
Accepting his potential bias, Strickland added that he did not think Clinton was believable. “What hurt Mitt Romney four years ago is going to hurt Hillary Clinton,” he said.
Moving away from the focus on Sanders and Clinton, White stressed that nothing is set in stone regarding the election.
“Chafee, Webb and O’Malley were attacking Clinton in a ‘take down the frontrunner’ strategy,” he said. “Look at what happened with Rick Santorum. He was polling 1 percent — then he almost won Iowa.”
Serhan addressed Clinton’s “hug your opponent” strategy. “I think she doesn’t want to completely discredit Sanders because there’s a reason people support him. He’s voicing a lot of concerns and grievances that a lot of young Americans have.”
The panel ended on a humorous note.
“Chafee was probably calling his Uber ride by the time the debate was winding down,” Serhan joked.

It’s not everyone who gets a shout-out from Taylor Swift, but Robby Hauldren, a freshman and member of rising EDM duo Louis the Child, is an exception.
Hauldren and his musical partner, Freddy Kennet, were recently supported by Swift in an Instagram post. The pop singer instagrammed a picture of her playlist, “New Songs That Will Make Your Life Awesome, I Promise!,” which included the duo’s song, “It’s Strange.”
With more than 1 million likes, Swift’s Instagram post certainly gave Louis The Child an extra boost, but the Chicago-based group has been gaining popularity ever since they started collaborating in high school.
“I met Freddy through a mutual friend when we both went out to see Madeon,” Hauldren said. “At the time, I was making mash-ups and getting a good amount of buzz, and Freddy was producing his own music too.”
After the concert, Kennet reached out to Hauldren, and the two discovered they had similar interests and EDM influences.
“We started making music together, came up with a name, and posted our stuff on Facebook for our friends to check out,” Hauldren said. “Later on, we got a manager who encouraged us to send our music to some blogs, which really helped us get more attention.”
Louis The Child finally got their first big break in 2014 at Chicago’s Spring Awakening Music Festival. SAWF is largely known for its culture of house music, but it features a wide range of artists including past performers Calvin Harris, Tiësto, Hardwell, Zeds Dead and Adventure Club.
This year, Hauldren and Kennet have their own tour, which starts on Oct. 17 in Chicago. Despite living in different cities, the two will be traveling every weekend to perform “It’s Strange” and other original hits.
“Freddy’s a year younger, so he’s finishing up his senior year of high school while I’m out here,” Hauldren said. “But back home we didn’t live together anyway, so we can still operate the same just by sending ideas to each other back and forth.”
At USC, Hauldren studies music industry and has already performed some of his singles and remixes at school-related events. This past weekend, he was featured at Phi Delta Theta’s registered party, Phi Delt Phitness.
“I heard about Louis The Child over the summer because there was a lot of buzz about Robby attending USC in the fall,” said Paul Samaha, Phi Delt’s social chair. “I began listening to all of their music on SoundCloud and instantly knew I needed them to perform at our house.”
Hauldren was the headliner for Phi Delt’s event. One of the fraternity brothers, Curtis Toyota, opened and closed the show.
According to Samaha, Louis The Child’s musical style is the perfect blend of blissful harmonies that lead up to a climactic beat drop.
“Both the harmonies and the beat drops never disappoint,” Samaha said. “Louis The Child is blowing up at an exponential rate, and we are extremely lucky to have been able to book them.”
Junior electrical engineering major Karen Wang, who was at the event, agreed that Louis the Child is a unique, up-and-coming group.
“Their futuristic beat is catchy because it gives you a light and happy feeling,” Wang said. “I first heard their music through a friend’s recommendation, so it’s surreal being able to see Robby live now.”
Looking ahead, Hauldren hopes to continue making music with Kennet. If the two make it big, he sees himself pursuing his passion full-time, but still holding onto his Trojan identity.
“Whether or not I’m here for one year or four years, I want to be involved in everything this school has to offer,” Hauldren said. “It’s already given me so much, so I’d love to give back in any way that I can.”

An event hosted by the Women’s Student Assembly was the topic of debate at the weekly Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
USG held its “Open Forum” program in which non-USG students can come in, voice a comment and have a discussion with USG senators and meeting attendees. Tuesday’s non-USG visitor, Brandon Zelner, was not physically present, but delivered his comment through a letter.
In the letter, Zelner discussed the meeting “Decolonizing Healing,” held by the USC Women’s Student Assembly and Academic Culture Assembly on Monday. Zelner wrote that it was “highly concerning” that the two organizations receive funding from USG. He took issue with the event description that said “alternative methods of healing are just as valid, if not more valid, than pharmaceuticals,” calling it “misinformed.” He concluded by suggesting that USG funds be “redirected toward events in which students can learn where and how to receive both affordable and accessible health services.”
The first response came from Shyann Murphy, executive co-director of WSA.
“He wasn’t there at the event, so he has no idea what went on at the event,” Murphy said. “No one was saying, ‘Don’t go to a doctor.’ That wasn’t what we were advocating for.”
Murphy said that the event did not criticize people for “going to the medical-industrial complex” but merely explored alternative medicine strategies alongside those of traditional medicine, as well as the issue of why healthcare is inaccessible to large portions of the population.
Jacob Ellenhorn, commuter senator, said that though he agreed that being exposed to different forms of medicine was acceptable, the way USG-financed events are presented should be carefully examined.
“I think that the issue the person is really addressing is that, while an event might be a certain way, when it’s marketed, it is marketed as something that it isn’t,” Ellenhorn said. “The event description … described an event that seems a lot different from the event that you actually held.”
Ellenhorn suggested that for future event descriptions, hosts should avoid “loaded” or “controversial” language to make sure that USG doesn’t get perceived in “a certain way” by the student body. He pointed out two phrases in the description, “‘current methods’ include feeding into corporations that don’t really care about our well-being as persons …” and “… the medical-industrial complex is violent towards people,” as examples of such language. Murphy immediately responded.
“I agree that it’s important to have accurate event descriptions, but again, I feel that our event description was very accurate,” Murphy said.
Ellenhorn interjected, denying the accuracy of the description. Murphy asked Ellenhorn not to interrupt her.
She added that it’s impossible to capture everything that will happen in an event in a description. She then asked Ellenhorn, “How many event descriptions have you written in your life? Do you know that an event doesn’t always go as the event description dictates?”
Murphy also said that people should come to WSA’s events before voicing any criticism of the organization.
Other USG members, among them Luis Vidalon-Suzuki, assistant director of the ACA, and Sabrina Enriquez, residential senator, also voiced their opinions on the issue. Vidalon-Suzuki emphasized that group directors should be accountable to their constituents above all, and that they were just trying to bring in “new perspectives” during the event. Enriquez also stressed the importance of avoiding tone-policing and attending events in order to formulate critiques.
At the end of the discussion, Giuseppe Robalino, USG residential senator attempted to clarify the issue at hand.
“It is clear that the event was going to be about the synthesis [of alternative and Western medicine]. This isn’t about tone policing, either, because there is no resolution being brought up that is directly prohibiting the use of certain language,” Robalino said. “This is a direct examination … of the USG programming fee, the budget and that being used in terms of … generating turnout.”
Robalino said that Zelner, and constituents like him, did not feel welcome in WSA’s event because of the language in the event description. Robalino argued for “energizing the student body,” using USG funds efficiently, and ensuring that as few students as possible feel alienated from certain events.
Also, why ya’ll gotta try to ruin the only places where I actually don’t feel alienated.
but like I didn’t feel welcome at the Milo Yiannopoulos event put on by Ellenhorn himself. So if ya’ll so worried about alienation, why don’t ya’ll do something about that.

Remember to hydrate when you are working out. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
Classes, extracurriculars, friends, sleep and then repeat. Amid the chaos of college life, fitting in a workout can seem like an impossible task. Making the trek to the gym is a hassle that many don’t have time for, but that doesn’t mean that physical fitness should be abandoned altogether. In fact, studies have shown that students who make the time to work out actually have more energy than those who don’t and require less sleep. Below are a few quick workouts that can help you stay active without eating up too much of your time.
Jump Roping
For most, jump ropes are regarded as little more than an elementary school pastime. However, the truth is that jump roping for just a few minutes a day will get your blood pumping and improve your cardiovascular fitness. Spend 20 minutes a day alternating between jump roping for three minutes, and speed-walking or jogging for two. The activity might wind you at first, but you’ll be surprised at how quickly your endurance builds.
Crunches
 Crunches can help tone a variety of muscles in your abdominal region, while simultaneously burning stomach fat. Start by doing 20 crunches every time you step into your room and work your way up from there. You’ll be ready to rock that crop top before you know it —  no tummy-tucking jeans needed!
Dance
This is my favorite method of exercising. Though an abundance of pre-choreographed dance workout routines are available, I recommend just blasting some of your favorite music and moving continuously for 20 minutes. In addition to being a great workout, dancing to your favorite songs without any sort of routine to follow can be therapeutic. 
Yoga
Though counterintuitive, one of the best things to happen to yoga is YouTube. The amount of content available online is incredible, with channels such as Yoga with Adriene and Yoga House regularly uploading accessible and interactive workouts. One of the best ways to start your morning out refreshed and energized is by following one of these tutorials. After 15 minutes, you’ll find yourself in a state of exercise-induced nirvana, guaranteed to boost your mood and productivity. 
Leg Lifts
This is a great workout for midterm season, when leaving your studying can feel positively sinful. While sitting at your desk, just extend one leg in front of you and hold it straight for as long as you can. Afterward, switch to the other. Repeating this a few times while you study is an amazing way to keep your lower body toned even when you don’t have time to hit the gym. 
When papers and projects pile up, instead of abandoning exercising all together, take the time to try out these short workouts. You can squeeze them into your schedule easily, and knowing that you’re taking the time to care for your body can help you feel less stressed and better prepared to tackle whatever challenge college throws at you.

They say dress for the job you want, not the job you have. However, until you land that dream job, it is just as important to dress for the job you have. When I started at my first real office job I was completely unsure of what to wear. Up until that point, my work uniform consisted of a red one-piece bathing suit and whistle for my summer job as a lifeguard. So in true millennial fashion I turned to the internet for answers and learned every industry has a unique office style. While specific companies have their own rules, the general standards for interns are as follows:
Finance Internships
If you are interning in finance, whether it is at an investment firm in Santa Monica or one of downtown Los Angeles’s big four consulting firms, you are going to need to be extremely conservative. Suits are a must-have. Although they are pricey, invest in one or two that are well-fitted and tailored. Colors range from black to gray to brown. Shoes should be understated and comfortable. Go for a close-toed shoe, for girls heels should be no higher than three inches — No high heels or flip flops. Ultimately, the goal is to look put together yet understated.

PR/Marketing/Editorial
While this includes a broad range of jobs, the office environment of each is something I call “business fashionable.” Unlike finance there is more freedom to embrace personal style. However, it is still important to recognize that office wear is meant to be conservative. This means tailored pants, sleeved blouses and dresses that don’t come much higher than the knee. Accessorizing is a great way to show off personal taste with statement jewelry or cute booties.
Shop Bob Joie Purine Blouse
Hollywood
The spectrum of jobs in Hollywood is extremely broad and for this reason I have included two outfit ideas. The first is applicable to an intern at a production company or network office. Desk jobs generally fall on the conservative side so stick with neutral colors and avoid flashy accessories.  The second outfit idea is for those that will be working in a writer’s room or on set. Both types of Hollywood jobs allow for much more casual outfits than finance jobs however it is important to still look polished. A quality blouse with jeans and flats is the perfect look for all day comfort.

Technology
The tech world is notoriously stereotyped for its affinity for hoodies, jeans and sneakers. Yet to fall into this fashion nightmare would be doing yourself an incredible disservice. Although you might be  interning at a l startup with a casual atmosphere, it is important to put together outfits that make you look professional. Chambray shirts are a perfect conservative yet casual piece to pull an outfit together.

There are two types of independence that most students gain when they begin college life. First, we have independence in terms of our schedules — the independence to go out whenever we want, wherever we want,  or to stay in and watch a movie when we should be studying. But the second type of independence is not quite as liberating. This type of independence is financial independence. As college students, many live on a budget and some students are responsible for managing their own finances and spending. But let’s be truthful here. We’ve all gone through that online shopping phase where we bleed our wallet dry, and then had that disappointing feeling when our account balance revealed we had only a mere $10 to our names.
To avoid a negative bank statement, I’ve compiled a list of underrated and affordable shopping websites for you so that you can still enjoy the wonders of online shopping and look like a million bucks while wearing an outfit that cost less than $50.
Missguided
Missguided is a forward-thinking online fashion brand that sells dresses, tops, bottoms, activewear, sleepwear, work wear, shoes, accessories — you name it! Missguided has everything you need and, most importantly, they believe that shopping is a right, not a luxury, which is clearly reflected in their affordable prices. The brand’s Coachella chic clothing boasts Forever 21-cheap prices. Items range from $15-50, and there are always promotions or sales going on with prices that go as low as under $10. They also have a 20 percent student discount and free standard shipping for orders over $80.
Missguided
Necessary Clothing
With stores locations throughout the downtown New York City area, Necessary Clothing offers affordable apparel, shoes and accessories for trendy young women. However, when you’re on the opposite coast, or anywhere in between, the store’s website is great for online shopping. Necessary Clothing’s style is Brandy Melville-esque with casual tops, sweaters and bottoms, but they also have very trendy and modern pieces all for reasonable prices. Similar to Misgguided, prices also range from $15-50, and the store offers free U.S. shipping for orders over $125. In order to take advantage of free shipping on a budget, try looking over the site with your friends and ordering together.
Necessary Clothing
Tobi
If you’re new to Tobi, and online retailer based in California, you can get 50 percent off your first order. I would describe Tobi’s style as very clean cut with modern silhouettes, cutouts and a classic color palette — think white, black, pastels, nudes. They offer free shipping for orders over $50 and free returns (thank the heavens!) so you can shop to your heart’s content without worrying if something won’t fit. Tobi also adds a ton of new items every single day so you’ll always have something new and fresh to see. Average prices range from $30-50.

Lucy in the Sky
Lucy in the Sky is an Australian-based store, and its style is characterized by the use of daring pops of color and prints and a classic style with bohemian flair. However, the store also features modern dresses with strappy back details and cutouts. It’s the perfect shopping destination when you want to update your closet with both edgy and hippie style. The average item costs around $30, making the brand super affordable. However, the site does not offer flat rate shipping, and as a result, the total shipping price can be quite high.

A day after the firing of coach Steve Sarkisian, President C. L. Max Nikias demonstrated his support for Athletic Director Pat Haden in a statement issued early Monday morning.
“As president of USC I am very, very fortunate to have Pat Haden as our athletic director — as is the entire Trojan Family,” Nikias said. “He is a man of true character and integrity, he cares deeply for our student athletes, and he always makes their well-being his highest priority.”
Haden had received criticism for the way he handled the Sarkisian situation, dating back to when he didn’t discipline the coach for his inappropriate behavior at the annual Salute to Troy event.
The 62-year-old Haden, who took over as athletic director in 2010, named offensive coordinator Clay Helton interim head coach after asking Sarkisian to take a leave of absence on Sunday.
“Pat Haden has been doing an outstanding job in leading Trojan Athletics in the past five years and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my unwavering support for him,” Nikias said. “I look forward to working with Pat Haden as our USC AD for many years to come.”
Based on Nikias’s sentiments, it seems Haden’s job is secure for the time being.
On Tuesday, the Trojans got back on the practice field for the first time since Sarkisian was fired.

I certainly didn’t see this coming. When Steve Sarkisian had his alcohol incident at an alumni event this August, I thought it would be an independent event. I thought it was bad and worth more serious discipline than it received, but it never crossed my mind that it would happen again.
Pat Haden didn’t think it would either. And sure enough, it did.
There’s been a lot of talk in the aftermath of the debacle that Haden should have seen it coming. The signs from Washington were clear; the red flags should have been vetted further. On top of the off-the-field issues, it marks the second unremarkable football hire in Haden’s tenure as athletic director, which some have said means that he, too, should lose his job.
But President C. L. Max Nikias gave Haden a vote of confidence yesterday, so Haden will head the search for the next head coach. Despite all the drama and damage to USC’s reputation from this circumstance, Haden has my vote of confidence as well.
Like detractors of Sarkisian while he was still at the helm at USC, critics of Haden are really erring in a hindsight bias. It’s too easy to look at this scenario, make an emotional judgment and call for the axe. But when I look at the specific controversy, I don’t think he should be fired.
I’ve been a critic of Haden before. After the infamous alumni event, I wrote that I was surprised Haden didn’t suspend Sarkisian for at least a game, especially given the school’s tough stance against Bryce Dixon for an alleged discipline issue. But I thought firing him absolutely would have been going too far. And that was pretty consistent with the rest of the commentary on the issue. The toughest punishment I heard suggested was a season suspension from Mark Whicker of the Los Angeles Daily News. But most of the commentary had to do with the embarrassment the issue caused to USC, not the need to make sure it didn’t happen again.
The only columnist I remember specifically worrying about the sake of Sarkisian’s health was Nancy Armour of USA Today. She suggested an indefinite leave to give him enough time to sort out his issues, which, in hindsight, would have been the right move at the time. Nobody else, as far as I can remember, thought it would be an issue again; we assumed it was a one-time thing and that he would be able to handle himself the rest of the season.
When we look back on Sarkisian’s time at Washington, we see that there were signs that alcohol was a problem for him. There were similar unprofessional comments he made at a Washington pep rally along with some receipts of pretty substantial alcohol tabs that became public.
But none of this was significant enough that Haden should have seen this coming before hiring Sarkisian. I know plenty of people who are very heavy drinkers in select social circumstances, but then do a perfectly good job of taking care of their work life.
This became an issue when Sarkisian started having problems in his personal life. His divorce from the mother of his three children this summer has now become public because of his repeated incidents. It’s a shame that something so private has to come into the public sphere, but that comes with being a football coach of a proud national program.
This is speculation for the most part, but it’s not hard to guess how an overreliance on substance morphed into a     full-fledged problem of alcoholism because of a divorce. With all the traveling, recruiting visits and hours upon hours of watching film, it’s not shocking that a full-time college football coach might not have spent enough time with his family. The heartbreak, disappointment and shame of that realization for a person so passionate about everything he does is something that can’t be quantified.
And there’s no way that an athletic director should be able to predict the outcome of his employee’s marriages. Haden had no way of knowing that this problem would develop while hiring Sarkisian. Yes, Haden is responsible for closely examining the track record of his hires, but saying that he should have seen this coming is going too far.
Looking at the Sarkisian hire from a football perspective is worth its own column. But I honestly think that, personal issues aside, there was plenty of potential for the football program to achieve great things under his tenure.
The harder question for Haden is how he handled the alumni incident. The pressure of high-stakes college football on top of his personal issues proved to be too much for Sarkisian, but you could have made the argument that Sarkisian needed to get back to work to forget about his home life.
But even if we do mark his handling of the alumni incident as a mistake, I don’t think we should forget about the rest of Haden’s work as an athletic director. His job was to clean up USC’s compliance issues with the NCAA. He has done that very well, even if other controversy has popped up during his tenure.
Now, Haden’s next hire could very easily be his last. He needs to get that right, because if USC’s next head coach doesn’t meet expectations or last more than two seasons, that would be indicative of a need for a change up top. And we’ll have plenty of time to discuss every possible candidate.
But Haden should be the man leading the program. This incident is a blemish on his career reputation, but not an irreparable one. No AD has been tested more in college sports, and the Trojans need Haden leading the charge through all of the challenges that are bound to happen when expectations and attention are so high.
 
Luke Holthouse is a junior majoring in policy, planning and development and broadcast and digital journalism. His column, “Holthouse Party,” runs Wednesdays.
What a naive commentary, totally focused on the alcoholism angle.
Haden should be fired because he has been an awful AD. 
1) Kiffin was obviously a Garrett hire, but Haden should have fired him immediately. It was obvious to knowledgeable fans that he was never head coach material.
2) what about Haden running onto the field to protest that call last season, while he was a member of the playoff selection committee,  no less? Embarrassing. 
3) not offering Ed Orgeron the job after he had earned it.
4) not landing an elite coach, a la Saban, Miles, Meyer, or Harbaugh.
5) the Kevin O’Neill basketball debacle was under Haden’s watch.
6) Sarkisian was such a piss poor hire to begin with. Not because he’s an alcoholic, but because he’s an awful football coach. A 12-6 record?!
Haden is a garbage AD.
Disagree with you totally. Haden should not be involved in any more hiring of football or another sport. He staked his unearned job on the Sarkisian hiring which he guaranteed would outlast his stay as AD. He needs to go back and be a Trustee if he wants to be involved with USC wholeheartedly. The Athletic Dept. needs an overhaul with some persons who have a real feel for the world of collegiate sports.

Head water polo coach Jovan Vavic was named Pac-12 Coach of the Century on Tuesday. Four of Vavic’s players, Joel Dennerley (2008-2011), Kostas Genidounias (2011-2014), J.W. Krumpholz (2006-2009) and Nikola Vavic (2010-2013) were named to the Pac-12 All-Century team.
The former Trojans have a combined 13 national championships and were all named National Player of the Year during their time at Troy. They all also helped Vavic win his record six consecutive national titles.
Three of the four won the Peter J. Cutino award during their USC careers, the highest award in collegiate men’s water polo. Krumpholz won the award in both 2008 and 2009 and went on to win a silver medal with Team USA at the 2008 Olympic Games. Dennerley won the award during his senior season in 2011 after starting as goalie during Vavic’s first four title runs. Genidounias, USC’s all-time leading scorer, won the award in 2014 after winning three titles under Vavic. Vavic has coached 10 Peter J. Cutino Award winners during his tenure.
Vavic’s son, Nikola Vavic, won four NCAA titles with his father and was named the National Player of the Year twice during his tenure.
Vavic has led the men’s and women’s teams to a combined 13 national championships, the most of any coach in USC history. He led the men’s team to a record six consecutive titles from 2008 to 2013. He has won a title with both the women’s team and the men’s team in the same year four times (1998-99, 2003-04, 2009-10 and 2012-13).
In addition to being named Pac-12 Coach of the Century, Vavic has been named National Coach of the Year 12 times and MPSF Coach of the Year 10 times.
Vavic, currently coaching his 21st season with the men’s team, has a 472-75 overall record, winning over 86 percent of his games.
Vavic’s daughter, Monica, is a senior on the women’s team and will enter the 2016 season as USC’s No. 7 all-time scorer.
The 16-man roster is comprised of four Trojans, four Cardinal, six Bruins and two Bears. Stanford’s Tony Azevedo was named the Pac-12 Player of the Century.

A day after the firing of coach Steve Sarkisian, USC players walked to practice among a sea of cameras. One USC freshman asked his teammate, “You were here when Coach O was, right? Was it this crazy?”
Athletic Director Pat Haden and interim head coach Clay Helton are committed to focusing on the players right now. For some of them, Helton will be their fourth head coach at USC.
“The biggest thing is a lot of these guys, fortunately or unfortunately, have been in this situation before. We were in it two years ago. I thought that staff that was together  did exactly what we’re doing right now; we bonded together as a Trojan Family and a football team,” said Helton in a press conference after practice.
Though some players are dealing with their fourth head coach since their time at USC, Haden is proud of the way the veterans are handling the unfortunate situation.
“It has also been very difficult for our players, as you might imagine, but I am really proud of the way they are handling it,” Haden said.
Haden added that the mindset of the team had similarly been his main concern when evaluating whether or not to keep Sarkisian after an incident in which the coach appeared intoxicated at an alumni event before the season.
“I felt a great deal of compassion for Steve Sarkisian,” Haden said. “He deserved another chance.”
Since then, Haden said he determined that Sarkisian’s recent conduct did not uphold either the behavioral expectations they had outlined after that night nor the standards for being a coach at USC.
“He knew those expectations and failed to meet them, so we made a decision in the best interest of our student-athletes, and that was to terminate Steve,” Haden said.
Haden said that both the NCAA and USC conducted background checks on Sarkisian and that he had talked to dozens of people, including head coaches, staff members, friends and “people who have known Sarkisian for many years,”  none of whom raised  a concern.
But Haden did not make excuses for the coaching fiasco that might come to mar his reputation as athletic director.
“At the time of Steve’s hire, I firmly believed that it was the right choice and fit for USC. As we sit here today, Oct. 13, the decision I made did not work out, and I own that.” Haden said. “I have great confidence in the ability of Clay and the assistant coaches to rally around this team. And I am really impressed by the reception he got when I introduced him.”
Helton has been attempting to provide players with a positive presence to get through this dificult time.
This was evident in practice today when the team continued the tradition of “Competition Tuesday.” Players laughed and cheered as they gathered in a circle for a hitting drill where two teammates collided in the middle. Offensive linemen were going against defensive linemen, tight ends against linebackers and so on.
“These kids had a blast today,” Helton said. “And they love to compete.”
Helton insists that being named the head coach, even in an interim situation, is still a serious honor.
“I’ve been in this profession 21 years. I’ve probably forgotten a lot of games and a lot of plays,” Helton said. “But I will never forget, as long as I live, Pat Haden introducing me to this team and the ovation they gave. I will never forget that for the rest of my life.”
When Haden addressed his record as athletic director, he repeatedly referred to his love of USC and being part of the Trojan Family. Comparably, Helton said the support he’s gotten from friends and players proves the Trojan Family exists and added that if USC is to reach their goal of winning the Pac-12 South, they are going to have to play as one.
“As we rally together as a Trojan Family during a hard time, you’ll see what the true character of what Trojans are made of,” Helton said.
The Trojans ended practice by breaking the huddle with the chant “family.” Helton and Haden both voiced their support for Sarkisian, saying he is a friend who is “going through a tough time.”
“Steve Sarkisian is a good person,” Haden said. ”I have known him a long time. And I know he is a good football coach. I wouldn’t hire him otherwise. I wish him the absolute best. He has my support and our support. We’re concerned for him, and we hope that he focuses on his health and his well-being.”
Isn’t it just a little clear who the next full-time football coach is?  Sorry.  I meant to say “should be?”  C’mon people.  Find out ASAP who Coach Helton wants as an offensive coordinator.  He is going to be very busy, so stop with the distractions.

Longtime fans will remember his work with English indie pop band, The xx. He was always there, in the background, slightly hidden yet an integral part of their signature sound — one best known for its hollow bass whisperings and clapping beats.
But lately, Jamie xx has been touring his debut album In Colour, an electronic project that, ahead of its release, was streamed on iTunes with colorful visuals that changed with each sound. It has also dropped hints at what to expect for The xx’s forthcoming album. Yet, Jamie Smith is something more than a fraction of The xx: He is bold and soulful.
Taking the stage in front of a sold-out crowd on Sunday night, the English music producer curated a two-hour dance party at the Shrine Expo Hall Auditorium, mixed with some of his own compositions, disco samples and jungle beats. The set flowed freely, and though it was not improvised, various tracks were chosen on the spot as Jamie dug deep into a nearby box of vinyl for portions of the night. Jamie played his audience as he teased out familiar notes from tracks of In Colour. He rarely played the record’s tracks in full, making an already eager crowd even more excited.
Jamie xx took the stage at 11 p.m., after DJ Harvey opened the show. From there, Jamie’s 120-minute performance took the audience into a beautiful multicolored musical voyage. Those in attendance bobbed to the beat and pumped their fists, filling the dance floor for an eagerly anticipated evening — after all, the show was moderately priced at a small-capacity venue. It was a true end to the weekend, as not many artists can hit a venue on Sunday night and evoke the same reaction as Jamie xx’s.
One of the evening’s highlights was undoubtedly when he played The xx’s “Sunset,” a song about the pain shared by estranged lovers. Jamie’s remix stays true to the original. As the track’s energy increased, an abrupt break welcomed the soothing vocals from Romy Madley Croft. “Sunset” served to a crowd eager to hear Jamie play more from his The xx days. Jamie also sampled Lana del Rey and performed his hits “All Under One Roof Raving” and “Girl.”
There was perhaps no bigger moment than “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times).” The unsuspecting banger off In Colour is based around a sample of The Persuasions’ 1971 song “Good Times.” The track was the most concentrated dose of vocals heard in Jamie’s set. It was a bridge between the abstract passages that had come before and the approaching moment when the rainbow lights would stop shining and the smoke would dissipate. But before that happened, Jamie closed off his performance with the solemn yet hopeful “Loud Places.” There was still some time to dance and laugh to the captivating, ethereal sound of Jamie xx.

The sweet, fluttering feeling of falling in love and the irrational madness that comes with heartbreak are two polar opposites that many experience throughout their lives. Few artists are capable of capturing such emotional intensity as simply and genuinely as poet and artist Lang Leav does in her newest book. Leav’s third book, Memories, is a collection of handpicked poems from her previous books — Love & Misadventure and Lullabies — along with 35 new poems. In every line, Leav skillfully weaves words together to create simple, beautifully stitched poetry and prose filled with heartbreak, longing and hope.
Throughout Memories, Leav’s writing describes the initial rush of falling in love and the feeling of being consumed in it. “When love finds you, it doesn’t come with crashing waves or thunderbolts,” she writes. “It appears as a song on the radio or a particular blue in the sky. It dawns on you slowly, like a warm winter sunrise — where the promise of summer shines out from within.” Her use of metaphor sets a dreamy, tender tone allowing the reader to feel the sentiments expressed through her words. The pages are filled with color illustrations that reflect themes in the book, drawn by Leav herself, featuring drawings such as a girl sitting cross-legged with a book and carnations in different colors.
In addition, her prose on the downfall of lost love is devastating, providing a stark contrast to her musings on the joy of it. “There are things I miss that I shouldn’t, and things I don’t that I should. Sometimes we want what we couldn’t. Sometimes we love what we could,” she writes. Leav’s use of simple words in this theoretical arrangement gives the reader time to slowly think about and reflect on the sentence. She explains in that sentence that the timing of love and longing are not right, that sometimes we love things that we can’t have and have no control over it. In “The Loneliest Place,” Leav dismally describes unrequited love as one of the most depressing feelings. “There is poverty in giving too much of your heart. When your desire for another is not returned in equal measure — nothing in the world can compensate for the shortfall. Sometimes the loneliest place is to be in love.”
In “Dark Room,” the romantic poet discusses the significance of words in a relationship. “Tell someone about me,” she writes. “I don’t want our story to end here, and your words may be the only thing that saves us.” Though she is no longer in the relationship, she does not want it to be forgotten. She believes that words can be a catalyst in preserving memories. The poem’s tone starts off pleading, but later transitions to optimistic. “Don’t let me fade away like a Polaroid. Time can be cruel in that way,” she writes. “But you and I are still breathing in this imperfect world. What could be an even greater miracle than that?” Despite the fact that she can never relive the love she once had or preserve her relationship, Leav concludes that the gift of life is an even bigger marvel in the broader scope of things.
Leav’s writing style may not be for everyone. Some might think that it’s too short, whiny or repetitive. However, Leav’s writing style is focused on simplicity with a deeper meaning. The poems are not long but are to be read slowly and intentionally. Anybody could finish Memories in the span of an hour, but it takes careful reading to feel the sentiment behind every word. Leav does not need complex and verbose prose to perfectly convey the feeling of love and loss; she possesses a talent for portraying heartbreak in brief, whimsical sentences.
Memories is a book that will comfort readers with its words, as Leav understands the exact feelings in times of heartbreak. She is an incredible wordsmith who turns her pain, passion and sorrow into a stunning work of art. As Leav writes, “It was words that I fell for. In the end, it was words that broke my heart.”

This past Saturday was World Mental Health Day, which got me thinking about my own mental health journey. I have been very proactive in making my wellness a priority after the sophomore slump led me to enroll in student counseling. Some people still find it shocking that I’m so open about my choice to get counseling, but I have no shame in sharing the steps I took to get better. Though student counseling changed my frame of thinking, the biggest obstacle was finding practices to keep moving forward on my own. One of the methods that helps me is meditation.
Meditation still carries a strange reputation. It is often tied to modern day pseudo-hippies and myths about spiritualism. I originally had trouble with the concept of meditation because all I’d ever heard was the idea of quieting your thoughts. This is not true. The hardest part about dealing with any mental illness is battling the part of the brain that rationalizes emotions and won’t let you escape the situations created in your mind. How can I just “turn them off”? After participating in Deepak Chopra’s 21-Day Meditation Challenge online, I realized that quieting your thoughts is the first misunderstanding of the power of meditation.
Meditation is not about turning off your thoughts. Rather, it is about getting in tune with them. It is extremely difficult at first because aside from the other thoughts running around, people might start thinking to themselves, “stop thinking” and lose focus altogether.
“One reason why meditation may seem difficult is that we try too hard to concentrate, we’re overly attached to results or we’re not sure we are doing it right,” Chopra wrote in The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.
In the 21-Day Meditation Challenge, Chopra guides each day of meditation with a new central thought and subject to focus on while meditating. This allows participants to have control over what they’re thinking and gain an understanding of how their thought process works. Each session, about 15 minutes, is easy to fit into a busy schedule and can be done at any point of the day. It takes 21 days to form a habit, so the point of this challenge is  to make controlling your thoughts a subconscious act. The ability to control your thoughts is the foundation for gaining more control in life.
What many people fail to realize with meditation is that the results are not immediate. Though I have experienced some changes in my life within 24 hours of starting meditation, I am also still meditating on things I started five months ago. One of the best lessons I took away from meditation is learning to trust the uncertainty. It becomes apparent that as long as you have done what you can, the rest is up to the effort you put forth in your thoughts and actions. It’s a cliché I try to avoid, but it is true that positive thinking yields positive outcomes.
There are various ways to begin a meditation journey. The Engemann Student Health Center offers an eight-week stress relief workshop that focuses on meditation called Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, in which students use mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and to facilitate their well-being. If you’re interested in participating in one of the 21-Day Meditation Challenges, registration is free online at Chopra Center Meditation. For those who would rather approach meditation in a do-it-yourself way, Relax Melodies is an app that has a wide variety of zen sounds to create a calming environment in order to have a productive session of focused thinking.
Whether you’re visualizing your future or just setting small-scale goals, meditation offers one of the strongest tools to determine the outcomes in your life, even when it might feel like life is completely out of control.

On Tuesday, Pat Haden gave a press conference in which he defended the hire of former head football coach Steve Sarkisian.
“He was vetted. You can disagree with the vetting, but he was vetted,” Haden said.
The conference came after many called for Haden’s job in light of Sarkisian’s firing and rumored alcohol problems. It appears that for now Haden’s job is secure. Shortly before the conference, President C. L. Max Nikias released a statement supporting the athletic director. “I look forward to working with Pat Haden as our USC AD for many years to come,” Nikias said.
Though in his five years at USC Haden has overseen successes — some of which he highlighted during the press conference — such a misstep as the Sarkisian hire requires at least an internal review of the hiring and vetting process of high-profile figures at USC, as well as of the decision to keep Sarkisian on after he was intoxicated at the Salute to Troy booster event.
With Sarkisian’s termination and his history of alcohol abuse coming to light, there are questions that need to be answered. Was Haden aware of Sarkisian’s drinking habits? If so, why was Sarkisian still brought on board? If he was not aware, why was the vetting process not more thorough? Haden failed to properly oversee the hiring process and allowed a glaring attribute of a potential coach fall through the cracks.
A Los Angeles Times investigation into his time at the University of Washington indicates the coach has a history of heavy drinking. On one trip, Sarkisian and three other coaches bought eight shots and five beers before noon. On another, Sarkisian ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne and six beers to his hotel room.
Yes, the L.A. Times reporters are professional journalists, trained and experienced in this, but if the newspaper  could dig this up in the weeks since the Salute to Troy event, then the Athletics Department should have been able to in the months they had to choose and vet a new coach.
Haden said he spoke to “dozens of people,” none of whom raised any concerns. But, in light of new evidence, this is a little difficult to believe. Perhaps, no one wanted to cast Sarkisian in a bad light or knew that there might be a serious issue. Or, perhaps, Haden and the department didn’t look hard enough.
However, even if Haden had somehow missed any indications of alcohol troubles before the hire, the Salute to Troy must have served as a wake up call for him as it did for the public.
“[After Salute for Troy], based on the input of trusted of medical professionals and staff, it was determined that he could continue coaching while seeking treatment,” Haden said. “I felt a great deal of compassion for Steve Sarkisian. He deserved another chance. That’s what I gave him.”
But this wasn’t an issue of second chances. This was an issue of helping a potentially very seriously troubled man get the help he needs. Haden’s decision was irresponsible — both for the football team — especially for the student-athletes — but also for Sarkisian himself.
This seems more than anything to be a case of wishful thinking. Wishful thinking that Sarkisian was fine, that the Salute to Troy event was just a onetime occurrence, that no one was in danger.
But in refusing to confront reality, Haden and co. not only obliterated USC’s chances for a successful season, they also played a dangerous game in risking a man’s health.
Being the head football coach at USC is no easy task. In addition to being at the helm of a storied legacy, the coach also is responsible for whether millions of dollars in alumni donations flow into the school each year. That kind of pressure can be a lot for anyone, let alone someone with a potential health condition. Letting Sarkisian continue coaching was completely irresponsible.
This incident is not something Nikias can just sweep under the rug. Though there might be something noble about him standing by his athletic director, allowing Haden, and the department as a whole, to escape unscathed indicates that the president does not take this seriously enough. An internal, but publicly acknowledged, review of the decision will at least prove the administration intends to do its due diligence and help ensure that, in the future, character and well-being are considered in these hires.
Daily Trojan Fall 2015 Editorial Board
Pat Haden is a liability to the football team and school.  I cannot imagine a competent, self-respecting coach will be excited about working for Pat Haden knowing what has transpired within the last 5 years.  [Hearing about Chris Petersen interview, I’m not sure Pat Haden knows what he should be looking for.]
If Nikias cannot part ways with Haden, Haden’s best move would be to name Clay Helton the permanent head coach as soon as possible, and get out of his way.  (Matter of fact, stay out of any stadium where Trojans play.)
Wait so one bottle of champagne and six beers (on separate checks) means the guy has an alcohol problem that Haden should have seen coming from miles away? Sark can’t possibly be sharing these drinks with other people, right? Or how, on one of the receipts in question, Sarkisian was buying drinks for other people, unless he really, really likes Baja Chicken sandwiches and Salmon BLT’s and that entire tab was for himself, in which case we’re talking about an incredibly corpulent man who died of alcohol poisoning. 
I just don’t understand how the media can take so much circumstantial evidence and then decide on its own merits and arbitrary criteria of what constitutes alcoholism to speculate that Pat Haden improperly vetted a candidate. I’m not saying Pat Haden’s a saint, but be careful when you talk ill of someone who took a pay cut to put out what was a dumpster fire with the Pete Carroll debacle. Pat Haden took a pay cut to take on perhaps the most thankless job in sports, and now people are demanding his ouster because “boo hoo we’re not winning Natties anymore.” 
To think that Haden has to deal with boosters, the President (who himself probably has a significant fundraising agenda as a partial stakeholder) and a media and fanbase that constantly second-guesses all of his decisions and still manages to run a serious program is a miracle in itself. 
If you want to blame anyone, blame impatient boosters and a spoiled fanbase that thinks it’s entitled to national title expectations on account of past successes. Blame every fair-weathered fan who doesn’t know the game that starts a chant calling for a coach’s job when that guy’s doing his best to preserve a thin roster that’s been further depleted due to injury by running bubble screens, stretches and powers to make the game clock run down faster. In short, go blame yourselves. 
Prior to Carroll, our last national title was in 1978. Does a quarter century between titles sound like a blue blooded “win now” culture to you? Get over yourselves and stop being so damned arrogant. This isn’t the Pete Carroll era anymore, and it’s time we start getting back to translating the talent we have into a title contender instead of always calling for the next guy’s head on a plate.
Quit talking about Sark’s alleged alcoholism. He was fired for being an awful head coach and going 12-6. He was Lane Kiffin part 2.
Both were awful hires.
My top 5 issues with Pat Haden
1. Initial news conference, I am hear to ease USC through the sanctions. Has done anything but ease us through.
2. After Judge Shallers review of facts regarding NCAA’s vicious illegal and subjective findings Haden chose to be on the NCAA’s rules committee implying USC was in the wrong!
3. When Kiffins head was being called for after the ridiculous #1 pre season ranking and subsequent reality of playing a football schedule with 50-60 players, he ignored all the safety warnings of asking amateur kids to play dangerously more snaps than should be allowed.
4. When the Arizona St game fell apart in the second half, the whole nation could see our amateur kids were simply gassed yet valiantly Fought On. Hadens reaction was to meet one of the most high profile coaches in the nation at an airport terminal to fire him in front of his players. Then refuse to allow him to ride back to campus with his players. Weakest move in history of AD, until he couldn’t even face Sarkisian like a man a tell him he was fired face to face! 
This is not a leader, this is a scared little boy riding the coattails of his ties to USC, every Trojan who ever played for us should be shaking their heads, and demanding HIS job!
You forgot him coming down onto the field. That was embarrassing. But Haden has done such a great job outside of football… that’s mens basketball program… and baseball program…
waytoocool, I hope you had tongue-in-cheek with that last remark. Ha!
But, even so, Pat is an honorable guy. His early order was to ease the Bush/Mayo incidents with the NCAA. He could have been the right guy, but it just turned out he didn’t have the b***s to deal with it adequately. And while the griddle was still hot, he brought in Kiffen. Kiffen in many, many respects was a lousy choice, not the least of which was the cumbersome baggage he brought that the NCAA did not like.
Well, Pat’s 62, a good retirement age. Go home, enjoy the family and the football and academic awards you achieved here and abroad. Unfortunately we’ve proven twice (Mike and Pat) that a USC football star doesn’t necessarily become a star A.D.
And as to Max, if he doesn’t handle this one, as it doesn’t seem he plans to do, he’s close to a ripe retirement age too. Alumni are getting a little tired when they start referring to him as the “photo app prez”.
As an aside, there’s talk in town about Josh McDaniels as a possible head coach. Jeez, that’s one guy we don’t even want close to town, let alone the campus. Please dismiss that one!

Last Wednesday, the USC College Republicans hosted British journalist and businessman Milo Yiannopoulos for a rollicking evening of denying the existence of rape, rape culture and trauma all at once.
Nearly four years ago now, I was raped by a fellow USC student during my first undergraduate year. Today, as a graduate student, I work at a campus-based crisis center and lead a student coalition, RISE, that is attempting to address issues of sexual and gender-based harm. Given these experiences, it should surprise no one that I find the premise of Yiannopoulos’s visit appalling.
However, I also see it as evidence of a troubling trend I wish to address: the fallacious use of free speech arguments to silence individuals impacted by sexual violence and other forms of trauma.
College Republicans President Jacob Ellenhorn states that the organization brought Yiannopoulos to campus because “free speech is constantly under attack.”
They see Yiannopoulos as a free speech champion persecuted by leftist ideology. I see a grown man throwing a fit because people don’t want to listen to him. Yiannopoulos has exercised his right of free speech to make inaccurate and hateful statements, yet can’t understand why so many people have judged his discourse as harmful, counter-productive and a waste of their time.
Yiannopoulos, in his turn, denies the possibility that opinions can be harmful, or that words can shape reality, calling such ideas “preposterous.”
Preposterous, indeed.
The Declaration of Independence? Certainly didn’t play a role in inspiring the American Revolution.
Mein Kampf, a manifesto of genocidal intent toward Jews? Who could have known?
How about the opinion held by a high-level university administrator that sexual violence isn’t a problem demanding serious attention? I can’t imagine that would have the slightest bearing on how a school chooses to approach the issue.
It is difficult to argue that words don’t carry power, particularly if you are Yiannopoulos, who makes a living off of them. For someone who laments the “assault [on] the First Amendment” over and above the assault of human bodies, Yiannopoulos certainly seems like the kind of person who thinks words, particularly his own words, matter a lot.
Directly acknowledging the power of words, however, sets Yiannopoulos at odds with his core argument: that rape culture isn’t real.
Rape culture does not necessarily mean a society that outwardly promotes rape. Rather, it refers to a society that commonly engages in behavior that excuses or otherwise tolerates sexual violence and affirms perpetrators’ choices to commit sexually violent acts.
Such is the effect of statements like Yiannopoulos’s, which justify the harassment of women based on their body type and declare the results of numerous studies on sexual assault to be “rubbish.”
Such is the effect of student organizations that prioritize their right to debate whether or not rape is a problem over stopping the rape that continues to be committed against our students.
Such is the effect of the repetition of myths about trauma coping mechanisms, so as to belittle the real impacts of trauma on the body and the brain.
We see an example of this last one in Daily Trojan’s own coverage of the Yiannopoulos event. In Kestine Thiele’s Oct. 8 piece, trigger warnings are described as disclaimers on academic texts which “allow students to opt out from reading them if they contain content that might cause unfavorable, emotional responses.”
From a trauma-informed perspective, this is simply not true. Trigger warnings are intended as an advisory to individuals who suffer from varying degrees of post-traumatic stress that may, within a particular text, trigger a traumatic flashback. This might happen when a veteran reads or watches a graphic account of war violence, or when a survivor of sexual abuse hears language similar to that used by their abuser.
It is both illogical and repulsive to suggest that trauma survivors are attempting to lighten their course load, or are not emotionally mature enough to handle the content of the course. Quite to the contrary, they are making their best attempt to manage their trauma symptoms and minimize the impact they might have on their learning and the learning of others. Yiannopoulos suggests that anyone triggered by classroom content should immediately be expelled; if we read between the lines, he is essentially saying that any student who has experienced trauma does not have a right to be here.
Acknowledging the impact of sexual violence and other trauma within the campus community does not prevent “the hard conversations”; it is the hard conversation. And it is Milo Yiannopoulos, the College Republicans and others who deny or dismiss violence who are refusing to engage.

Masters of Public Diplomacy second-year student
“They see Yiannopoulos as a free speech champion persecuted by leftist ideology. I see a grown man throwing a fit because people don’t want to listen to him.”
Obviously some people do want to listen to him because he was invited to campus for that very purpose. I disagree with many of his views but he’s correct that rape culture is a myth and “the numerous studies on sexual assault” relied on by feminists to prove its existence are shoddy and useless.
Thank you Ms. Bessey for your rebuttal on Yiannopoulos’ statements at the recent USC College Republican’s event. I was hoping a student would and your response was true and credible. As for
Yiannopoulos he should be disregarded as the self aggrandizing shock jock that he is. As for the USC College Republicans who invited him to speak they are as just at as confused as their adult counterparts. Floundering in the messes they have created for the American people and out of touch with Amerca and many of their constituents. Which brings me to the issue of the female college students who are members of this Republican club.  Were they at this event and if so how did they sit by and let this shock monkey marginalize them as human beings. Yiannopoulous not only spoke  against the fact that rape culture exists but that women should not study or pursue a career in the STEM fields because they had lower IQ’s! How could a women, republican or not, sit in on this event and not be outraged? Where are their voices? And if they rely on a notion that  Yiannopoulos’ (a Brit not an American speaking about Amercan law) views on free speech is what they were in attendance for they can not see the forest thru the trees. Yiannopoulos and their male college republican brother’s obviously believe women even Republican women should not have free speech. Whuch is self-evident in the denial of the existence of rape culture and the idea that women have lower IQ’s. I would be interested in hearing their POV on Yiannopolous’ opinions!

Exactly a week ago, I dropped my brand new iPhone into a toilet — a clean toilet, but a toilet nonetheless. As it turns out, iPhones don’t like being dropped in toilets, even if they’re put in rice for the next 48 hours. After self-loathing and tears, I began to reflect on my time with my two-week old phone. Yes, it was that new.
Like most millennials, I’m always on my phone. My mom is fairly critical of the habit and throws a temper tantrum every time I pull it out during dinner or when she’s trying to talk to me; however, up until a week ago I didn’t really see the problem. After all, I always considered myself good at multitasking.
But actually, I’m pretty bad at it. I think that I’m so busy and  I have to do many different things at once, but then my attention becomes divided and I make mistakes. And people who are always on their phone multitasking drop their beautiful, thumbprint-sensitive phones into toilets.
Easing down on multitasking — and slowing down in general — can prevent mistakes for most busy college students. Around campus, pedestrians who are on their phones often get hit by cyclists. I, for one, have been the biker dodging people who aimlessly meander while talking on the phone. Unfortunately, I’ve also been the pedestrian nearly hit by a biker because I’m on my phone and not focused on my whereabouts.
Researchers have referred to these glued-to-their-phones walkers as “digital deadwalkers.” In an article in the Washington Post, Alan S. Hilibrand of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons claims that “60 percent of pedestrians are distracted while walking, meaning either on the phone or doing something on their phone.”
In the same article, Hilibrand even said that he’s seen people come into the emergency room who were hit by cars because “they’re looking at their phone and not paying attention to the fact that a vehicle is making a turn.”
According to Hilibrand, in 2005, 256 pedestrians received hospital treatment for injuries they received while walking and using their phones; and that number grew sixfold by 2010. It sounds ridiculous, and though it might not be society’s biggest problem, it is a problem that can be easily solved: We can put down our phones and, as cliché as it is, stop and smell the roses.
The problem of constant phone reliance also exposes the fact that in college — especially at an academically rigorous and competitive college like USC — we feel the need to move at a superhuman pace. We need to get everything done in a short amount of time, which often involves having our phones glued to our sides.
Students are encouraged to intern, work, take the maximum amount of units, join clubs and have a social life. I personally feel like I always need to always have my phone on me in case I receive an important email, call or text, whether related to work, school or my social life.
There’s so much going on all the time that there’s a nonstop pressure to do everything. I recently had a friend confide in me that he felt as though he was doing way less than everyone else and felt the need to join more activities just to compare to his friends. In a school of overachievers, we have to keep busy to keep up.
However, sometimes we unfortunately turn to our phones to provide a feeling of involvement and importance. If I’m always walking while on the phone, I’m busy — I’m searching something, I’m responding to important correspondence and, most significantly, I’m not wasting any time.
From now on, I plan to make a conscious effort to set my phone down — and maybe not keep it in my’ back pocket — in order to both prevent mistakes and distractions and to hopefully slow down my life a little bit. And I suggest other students consider the same — because our college campus is a “digital deadwalker” disaster waiting to happen.
Learn from my mistakes. Put your phone down and, hey, maybe you’ll be one of the lucky ones who doesn’t drop it in a toilet.

If you have yet to taste this foodie phenomenon, you are missing out. We all love sushi, but why not spice up your spicy tuna rolls by adding a warm and buttery crunch? Crispy rice makes any sushi roll 10 times better, adding delightful consistency and flavor. Trust me, once you try crispy rice, you will never look at regular sushi the same way again. Here are the top four spots in L.A. for crispy rice sushi.
1. Katsuya
Located a short drive from USC at L.A. Live, Katsuya is one of the original makers of crispy rice. Their spectacular roll includes spicy tuna atop rice crisped to perfection with a buttery finish, topped with a jalapeño pepper for a spicy kick. They even offer a 15 percent discount at the L.A. Live location for USC students — there’s no excuse not to go out for sushi here.

2. Katana
This Asian-fusion hotspot is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles. Located on Sunset Boulevard in the heart of West Hollywood, this hip restaurant features a diverse menu highlighted by its Hanabi spicy tuna on crispy rice. The outdoor patio overlooking Sunset and the L.A. skyline adds to the dining experience. As an additional bonus, you might just happen to run into your favorite celebrity so make sure to dress to the nines.

3. Yatai
This high-end Asian tapas restaurant features one of the best crispy rice creations in the game. The only thing better than crispy rice sushi is a crispy rice burger. Instead of a bun, a warm buttery crunchy layer of rice sandwiches spicy tuna, avocado and secret sauce. Sign me up!

4. Shojin Downtown
Calling all avocado lovers! This sushi spot in the heart of Little Tokyo offers its own twist on the classic spicy tuna and crispy rice roll, layering it with fresh avocado and chili flakes.

The USC Trojans are more reality TV than Keeping Up with the Kardashians. That is never a good sign. On Thursday night we witnessed the worst game since the loss to Washington State two years ago. The offense was disorganized and the quarterback play was subpar at best. It just seemed like something was off. And now with Coach Steve Sarkisian taking an indefinite leave of absence issued by athletic director Pat Haden, it seems like the loss was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I am hopeful however. I think Coach Clay Helton is a tremendous coach and if given the support by USC, he can lead the Trojans back to where we were some 10 years ago. It’s not going to happen this year, but I like where we are heading if he is leading us.
Side Note: After this report card we are in danger of being placed on Troy Talk’s academic probation
Grades:
Quarterback: F
People are calling for Coach Sark to be fired, and while that may have some merit, I don’t blame the loss solely on him. Kessler was slow, uncertain, and extremely unimpressive. This was a game that USC surely had the edge in quarterback play, but it was Kessler, and not UW’s Jake Browning, who looked like the true freshman. I still believe Kessler can do a good job at quarterback, but as I have said before he lacks the killer instinct to lead us to a perennial powerhouse.
Running Backs: B+
I was actually surprised at how well we ran the ball. Tre Madden had over 100 yards on the ground. Dominic Davis even showed a glimpse of playmaking potential when he broke off a little catch and run. But for some reason we seemed to stray away from the run. I think a heavy dosage of our run game is going to be crucial to get the victory next week in South Bend.
Wide Receivers: B-
I can’t really give a grade for this group considering Kessler failed to get them the ball. Juju Smith-Schuster even had an uncharacteristic and very crucial fumble deep in our territory. Kessler needs to find a way to distribute the ball and not lock on to just Smith-Schuster. Despite the injuries to Steven Mitchell and Darreus Rogers, I still think this group has the potential to be unstoppable.
Offensive Line: C+
Okay some of the sacks were the fault of the offensive line. But Cody Kessler was too slow in breaking down the defense and at times folded under the pressure when his #1 target was covered. If Washington blitzes 6+ guys, the offensive line can only do so much. This group still needs to improve mightily, but they did give the running backs some holes against a very good front four of the Huskies.
Defensive Line: D+
I am still not seeing what I want from this group. I thought we may have turned a corner against ASU. However, I still see us getting pushed back in crucial situations. We are truly seeing how much difference once player can make with Leonard Williams gone. Maybe the new coaching change inspire this group, but that doesn’t seem very likely.
Linebackers: C
Same old, same old. An overall average performance with flashes of brilliance. I saw more blitzing (meaning about four blitzes) where we sent the athletic guys we have in our linebacker corps. And in my opinion, it worked out most of the time. However, I think the general consensus is that Wilcox’s “bend-don’t-break” mentality is not conducive to the development of our young linebackers.
Secondary: C
Let’s look at the silver lining. Biggie got his first pick! But that’s just about all that happened in this game. Numerous time our secondary got beat only to see Jake Browning overthrow a Washington receiver or have that receiver drop the ball. Things could have been a lot uglier if the talented freshman QB would have been on his game. The secondary needed to rattle this guy, but I’d consider it a failed mission.
Special Teams: C+
Alex Wood missed when Heidari wouldn’t have missed. That’s about the moral of the story. When we need a short field goal in the second quarter, Wood is our guy. But we lack the confidence in our special teams unit that is necessary to win the big games. Albarado continues to improve with his punts. Adoree’ is trying too hard in the return game, but I can’t blame him for that. Somebody has to make something happen.
Overall: D+
The Trojans played horribly. This is definitely not a grade that goes up on the refrigerator. Hopefully we turn things around and salvage the season. Believe it or not, I think we somehow beat Notre Dame next week. Don’t ask me how. Logic does not apply.
Fight On!

Use the following tips to avoid the flu this season. Mega Gupta | Daily Trojan
Despite the scorching temperatures outside, fall is in full swing and the infamous USC plague is making its rounds. One need only listen to the sniffles, coughs and sneezes echo through Taper Hall to know that no one is really safe anymore. Students are rarely ever alone, eating together, sleeping together, going to (or ditching) class together and spending pretty much every moment in between together. This kind of close proximity makes it only too easy for virus and disease to spread, making college campuses breeding grounds for the illness like the common cold and flu.
With their busy schedules, students should take all necessary precautions to avoid a bout of the flu, differentiable from a mere cold by muscle and joint aches, chills, a high fever and severe headaches. The college lifestyle makes students ill-equipped to fight off the flu, often maintaining irregular exercise and sleep schedules or not getting enough vitamins through their diet. Not only does this type of lifestyle put students at a higher risk for getting the flu, it puts them at higher risk for being sick during midterms and final exams, as well.
Studies show that only about 10 percent of students receive the flu vaccine each year, and that about 1 in 4 students contract the flu. These striking numbers prove that college students are either super confident about their health or do not know that most schools offer low-cost or free flu vaccines. For USC students, the Engemann Student Health Center offers the quadrivalent flu shot for $25 in the Immunization Clinic, protecting students against the two type A influenza viruses and two type B influenza viruses. If $25 bucks for a flu vaccine does not make your wallet happy, the L.A. Department of Public Health will have free flu shots on campus Nov. 3 from 10 a.m.–2 p.m. on Trousdale Parkway, too. For those with a fear of needles, ask for the nasal mist alternative, which is much less intimidating.
If just the idea of getting a vaccine at all cramps your style, then there are certainly other things to do to keep yourself from getting or spreading the USC plague. Some tips include practicing proper coughing and sneezing etiquette (sneeze into the crook of your arm, NOT your hand); wash your hands regularly (I’m looking at you, girl who came out of the stall and directly left the bathroom); avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth (who knows who last touched that door handle at TroGro?); and clean surfaces regularly (wipe down your phone, desk and laptop mouse pad at the very least).

A day after the firing of coach Steve Sarkisian, President C. L. Max Nikias demonstrated his support for Athletic Director Pat Haden in a statement issued early Monday morning.
“As president of USC I am very, very fortunate to have Pat Haden as our Athletic Director — as is the entire Trojan Family,” Nikias said. “He is a man of true character and integrity, he cares deeply for our student athletes, and he always makes their well-being his highest priority.”
Haden had received criticism for the way he handled the Sarkisian situation, dating back to when he didn’t discipline the coach for his inappropriate behavior at the annual Salute to Troy event.
The 62-year-old Haden, who took over as athletic director in 2010, named offensive coordinator Clay Helton interim head coach after asking Sarkisian to take a leave of absence on Sunday.
“Pat Haden has been doing an outstanding job in leading Trojan Athletics in the past five years and I want to take this opportunity to reiterate my unwavering support for him,” Nikias said. “I look forward to working with Pat Haden as our USC AD for many years to come.”
Based on Nikias’s sentiments, it seems Haden’s job is secure for the time being.
On Tuesday, the Trojans got back on the practice field for the first time since Sarkisian was fired.
This is sad to hear. Because the lack of leadership and having an understanding of leadership, starts at the top. Unfortunately as this trickles down one can observe, what has Pat Haden done so “outstanding”…”in the past five years”, as described my President C. L. Max Nikias? Perhaps he has a different version on the definition of the term “outstanding” than I do. Just think in the past past five years USC has lost to UCLA every year, USC has an extremely high Head Coach turn over rate…..should I continue. So overall the leadership of the head coach seems to not be there. This puts USC at risk of loosing recruits, making the donors reconsider, etc. Perhaps the leaderships needs to also change not only at the mid management level of Athletic Director but consider impeachment and bring in new leadership. I am not suggesting that President C. L. Max Nikias has done a poor job in other areas leading the University because he has. However with reference to the USC Football Program and it’s leadership, it just seems the inevitable will continue and will occur in the near future unless major changes are taken.
In addition check the DT vote on whether USC should ask Pat Haden to step down. Currently the “yes” votes are over 60% The USC President should see this.
