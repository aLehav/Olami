In the weeks before I left for Paris, I read four essays by James Baldwin: Encounter on the Seine: Black Meets Brown, A Question of Identity, Equal in Paris and Stranger in the Village. I read Baldwin’s essays simply as an idea of a black experience in Paris, not a guide to one. But I was also convinced these essays would provide some critical insight into a topic I have been interested in, since I noticed the plethora of black artists who have, during their respective times, flocked to Paris.
I was trying to understand, first, why these artists went to Paris; second, the relationship to the city and treatment by others, that, for some reason, seemed to provide a relief and escape – compared to the relationship and treatment they’ve experienced in the United States. In short, I was curious about the stories I have heard, and for some, envious.
Thus, I came to Paris with questions. These questions stemmed from assumptions, from secondhand assertions and from the image of Paris in American cinema. But out of all the questions, the underlying one was, “What was this great city? And, most importantly, “Why do so many seem to claim it?”
And now, it was my turn.
I cannot speak accurately to how tiring and long the process of obtaining a visa was. My mother did much of this process by herself. However, when I went to the consulate to apply for a visa, I was the one who caught that I was missing a final page — knowing they would not accept incomplete applications — and went to print it, quickly, so I would not be late to my 2 p.m. appointment. At least I was useful for something.
Once I had been approved for my visa, two months passed, and soon, after a two-hour plane delay, seven hours passed in the air. Next thing I knew, I was descending into Paris. My anxiety had flared at a horrible TSA checkpoint at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, when one machine broke down right when I was about to place my items through the scanner, and TSA agents would not allow us to leave the line. It got even worse when the lady next to me on the plane took one look at me, then never came back — instead, she sent another black girl, similar in appearance to me, to take her place. So, when I was making my way to passport control, I knew I was going to go into full panic.
There was no panic, however. Despite all the horror stories, passing through passport control, for me, was a breeze, even though I accidently stood in the European Union line rather than the foreigner line. It took less than 20 minutes, as the EU line was moving faster than the other line, and in some ways, I felt I had accidentally cheated the system.
My mother prepared me with a million answers to the supposed million questions passport control agents were going to ask me. This was also my first time ever leaving the United States, and she wanted me to be more than prepared. Instead, when I finally got the agent, he simply smiled and asked what was wrong with my hair — a fair question, as the day I had my passport photo taken, I was having a terrible hair day. It wasn’t until after I tried to leave the airport with my bags that I was subsequently stopped and then questioned about my motives for entering the country and if I had anything to declare.
After retrieving my luggage, I waited for the rest of my group to arrive so we can be taken to the hotel. I was desperate for a shower and coffee. Spending the night on a plane was not ideal, or, at least, not in coach class. But soon, as I was in the shuttle traveling from the airport to the hotel, I began to miss the United States.
I missed the United States because it was familiar to me. Things like my bed, my bathroom, my kitchen. Even New York City and Los Angeles  — two alternative places I call home — were familiar to me. My mind could not even begin to fathom what Paris would be like, and how I would survive here at all.
Are Americans required to have visas for visiting France? I thought that all that was needed is a valid passport.

Fall 2017 runways were more diverse than ever, Biel Parklee and Lauren McCarthy wrote for W Magazine. While the call to diversity was bold, designers’ trends were bolder. This season’s fashion trends of embroidery, reds, audacious jackets, fashion-statement shoes and mismatched patterns demand that the truly stylish be creative risk-takers. 
Embroidery
Hand-embroidered fabrics made the runway this fall, inspiring images of the artisan stitching by hand. Designer Alexander McQueen embroidered black dresses in a way that resembled baseball seams. You can showcase your playful side by choosing embroidered book bags, jeans and even luggage. Ladies can begin the week with an embroidered dress and a bag matching one of the colors used in the fabric.
Many Shades of Red
Designers used different shades of red for night and day outfits, demanding we no longer hide behind the safety of muted colors. If Designer Dries Van Noten  can decorate an off-white suit with red foliage then you can try a velvet skirt with a plain, burgundy sweater. Even go a step further by accentuating deep reds with metallics. If you’re feeling traditional (and really cold), you can venture back to the retro days of corduroy. Liana Satenstein wrote in Vogue that Marc Jacobs persuaded Kendall Jenner to wear blood-red corduroy flares, making it safe for anyone to add corduroy to their closet. 
Mismatched Patterns 
Because plaid is one of the safest patterns to wear, it has not really gone out of style. Red, long-sleeved shirts with vertical black lines are a favorite style choice for many, not just hipsters. Designers incorporated different types of patterns in their collections, even extending complex patchwork to jeans to give them a handcrafted appearance. Jeans with different shades of fabric sewn into the pant legs add variety for those wanting their edgy style to feel a bit more homespun. 
Audacious Jackets
Jackets offer so much flexibility: statement jackets that use one of the major fashion trends can be draped over a carefully planned outfit. That way, you can still look stylish on an autumn day. Prada used eye-catching jackets from various trends throughout her collection. One design, a burgundy corduroy suit complemented by a gray shirt, makes the everyday business suit even more striking. 
Statement Shoes
Combat boots made their way down the runway along with shoes embellished with beads. This signals that shoe trends are starting to embrace the “fashion forward” spirit. Just like jackets can make a statement, your feet can as well. For an everyday look, choose slouchy boots. Whether they’re metallic gold for the evening or gray for the day, slouchy boots are a fun way to draw the eye down to the leg.

On Aug. 28, New York-based house producer and vocalist Yaeji released a single featuring primarily Korean lyrics and a catchy and consistent pop beat, offering surreal yet substantial advice such as, “Put the unexpected tomorrow/on the back of your hands/and apply it in a circular motion.” The cryptic lyrics are perfectly complemented by the accompanying video for “Last Breath,” which is both an exhibition of the track and a functional makeup tutorial.
In March, Yaeji release her eponymous debut EP on GODMODE, a music company that promotes “way-left artists.” Yaeji’s understated vocals feature conversational, yet persuasive personal lyrics that explore her Korean-American identity while retaining a relaxed, danceable quality. Her unique style of house is minimal, but packs a punch when required. Yaeji – EP has the shining distinction of containing zero bad tracks.
“Noonside,” a paradoxically chill account of waiting in line at the airport, eases the listener into the EP. Soft pops and muted synths evoke both boredom and anticipation. Next, “New York 93” utilizes repetitive refrains to explore the complexity of feeling displaced in one’s hometown. Yaeji’s ethereal tone and reverberated vocal stylings induce a trancelike state among listeners. “Feel It Out,” a fast-paced party track with emphatic rhythms and scattered synths, prompts listeners to embrace cross-cultural experiences reminiscent of Yaeji’s own. “Guap,” a rework of the Mall Grab original, is nearly comical with its aggressive lyric about club attire, “All black, from head to toe/You can’t see me inside the club.” The remix is a highlight of the collection. It feels like an immersive sonic experience complete with pounding, sliding synths and acid undertones. “Full of It,” the final track on the album, hits home with Yaeji’s defiant cry of: “Distant like ignorance/Resistance, full of it.” Coupled with a powerful driving beat, Yaeji’s last word is a promise of exciting work to come.

This overtly feminine expression represents exactly what the electronic music scene needs at the current moment. Currently, female producers and DJs are experiencing prominence and camaraderie through collectives such as Discwoman in New York and SISTER in Los Angeles. Workshops such as Intersessions exist for the sole purpose of providing women and individuals on the LGBTQ+ spectrum access to equipment and knowledge critical to electronic music production. At the same time, wildly successful members of the all-male Giegling collective selectively ignored the sexist ideals of DJ Konstantin, one of their members, until a quote in which he asserted male DJs’ superiority to female DJs was published this June in the German magazine Groove. Women DJs and producers are now and have always been creative selectors and innovators. 
In the face of opposition, Yaeji and her peers prove female expression in all of its breadth has a place in the realm of electronic music.
If you like what you hear, then you’re in luck. Yaeji will be co-headlining a show presented by Directory and Leisure Sports Records in Downtown this Friday. Do yourself a favor and dance with this dynamic new producer live and in person.

Every college student has experienced the dilemma of craving Chipotle at 3 in the morning. But don’t worry; there are plenty of 24-hour establishments around Los Angeles that will satisfy your late-night hankerings. When your stomach is rumbling  at an unreasonable hour, these restaurants will sate your appetite:
El Huero
One of USC’s finest is El Huero, everyone’s favorite roadside establishment that serves students from dusk till dawn right across from the Row. Maybe it’s not the classiest joint, but certainly it’s  the best way to cure post-party comedowns and it has been a longtime staple of Figueroa Street. El Huero’s menu touts a variety of standard Mexican grub, including vegetarian options, and its infamous carne asada fries are many students’ go-to “drunchies.” With only one location in existence, El Huero truly is a local gem.
Kitchen 24
Kitchen 24 provides comfort food that will rival your mother’s. Treat yourself to the greasy goodness of fast food in a classy setting. Here, you will be greeted by friendly staff who stand over a sea of candy enclosed by glass cases, well out of your reach until you’re seated in a comfortable and perfectly pink booth. The restaurant emphasizes hearty, fresh and homemade menu items and is committed to becoming a home for everyone in the communities it serves. This eatery boasts locations in both Hollywood and West Hollywood and offers a myriad sweet and savory foods you won’t want your personal trainer to know about — plus $15 bottomless Bloody Marys and mimosas on Saturdays. 
24/7 DTLA
If you were a freshman at USC any time in the past decade, you have probably taken pictures on the rooftop of the Standard Hotel. What you may not have realized is that this popular photo spot is also home to a 24-hour restaurant on the lower level of the hotel. This trendy restaurant has three separate menus: All-Day, Overnight and Weekend Brunch. The spread of food is immense, ranging from brioche to burgers and coffee to cocktails, and is sure to have quick bites to satisfy all cravings.
The Original Pantry Cafe
Another downtown landmark appeared in 1924 in the form of The Original Pantry Cafe. Every time I walk past it, the line is snaked around the block and satisfied customers are packed inside. It’s the perfect detour on the way back from work, and is one of the easiest downtown restaurants to visit even if you don’t have a car; the Metro Expo line will take you there in just 14 minutes. The iconic cafe only accepts cash, however; there’s a convenient ATM right by the cash register. And besides, who doesn’t like to get breakfast for dinner?
Los Angeles’ dynamic nightlife isn’t merely limited to bars and clubs. Explore the city, eat to your heart’s content and extend the hours of conversation — and your waist measurement — at these prime, 24-hour eateries.

As USC’s newest institution, the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance has quickly created a distinguished program for dancers across all genres. Since its founding in 2012, talented dancers have flocked to this program, including several members of the Miniotics, a youth dance team that has competed in numerous competitions across the United States. The most intriguing part of Kaufman, however, is not the talent of its dance majors, rather the diversity of students pursuing dance minors.
Kaufman’s dance minor has come a long way since its inception; the program has grown dramatically from merely eight students to 105 this past year. Students minoring in dance come from a variety of majors, from history scholars in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to chemical engineers in the Viterbi School of Engineering. In total, 49 different majors comprise the 105-person dance minor this year. No prior experience is necessary to minor in  dance, and USC students seem to take full advantage of that.
Although Kaufman only offers three minor programs, each student has a different reason for pursuing dance. 
For Sunshine Liu, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, it was about achieving a personal goal and finding a niche. Liu had no dancing experience prior to coming to USC, but that did not deter her from her passion for dancing.
“My senior year of high school I set a goal for myself: I wanted to dance,” Liu said. “No matter which university I ended up at, I knew that I wanted to be a part of the dance community. Luckily for me, USC offers dance courses to non-majors, which I quickly took advantage of, and also has many different dance clubs for various styles and levels of skill, making it easy for anyone to be a part of the dance community.”
For Sean Buckley, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health, dance has always been an integral part of his life.
“I have been dancing my whole life basically. Mostly tap and ballroom with a little bit of ballet, jazz, and hip hop,” Buckley said. 
After seriously considering and deciding against dance as a major, Buckley turned to environmental science and marine biology as a major. 
“I still wanted to dance at USC and be a part of the amazing new dance program, so a minor seemed like the perfect thing to do,” Buckley said.
Student reasons for pursuing the minor range from stress relief to learning something new to continuing a hobby. No matter what their skill level is going into the minor, every student will finish their curriculum having learned something new.
“I’d have to say that [dance] has been a great way to open up my dance knowledge as a whole,” Buckley said. “Not only through dance studies lectures and other elective lectures like choreography in theater, but [because] I’m able to really easily take dance styles like jazz, ballet and hip hop that I really have very little knowledge of and that I know will improve my dancing in all disciples.”

In August, a New York Times profile on the modern-day college student revealed that a quarter of the more than $41 billion given in charity to higher education ended up in the pockets of just 20 institutions, squeezing other institutions — especially community colleges from accessing a growing pool of higher education funds.
Much of this philanthropy comes in the form of donations to endowments, or funds that facilitate a school’s executive functions and ability to grow.
Endowments function primarily as investments, with universities employing a diverse portfolio to seek quick returns. In fact, USC ranks among the top five U.S. college endowments for one-year returns. But most donors restrict the scope of their gifts by earmarking them for research or financial aid, with contributions for student assistance growing from 15.9 percent to 16.8 percent over the last decade.
Undaunted by the massive endowments of Ivy League universities, in 2011 USC announced a fundraising goal largely thought to be the biggest in American academia. Fast forward six years and USC has now attained its $6-billion fundraising goal over a year ahead of schedule, with $4.71 billion already lining the coffers and more on the way.
With $4.71 billion in tow, USC’s endowment ranks the 21st in the nation — and this sum represents a monetary value larger than 42 countries’ Gross Domestic Product.
At a time when tuition hikes are the norm and loans and debt are multiplying, students and parents often cast a skeptical eye toward multi-billion sitting pots of gold.
Despite these gaudy figures, USC is no University of Stagnant Capital. While half of donations expand the University’s endowment and thus are invested for further returns, the rest is devoted toward new buildings, labs and research, with 100 new faculty positions already created, 19 new research centers and institutions endowed and $330 million more devoted annually to financial aid.
To students, where this money goes is just as important as where it comes from. With over 322,000 individual donations — 64 percent of which come from non-alumni — USC’s ambitious fundraising efforts resemble a grassroots political campaign, with hundreds of thousands of people buying into the goal of expanding the impact and reach of the University. With that being said, roughly 500 people donated a million or more to the cause as well, all of which involved a relatively low cost of about nine cents for each gift dollar raised.
But endowments swell through investments as well, and where universities park their dollars raises moral and ethical questions. Generally, universities focus on lucrative firms with strong returns on investment, many of which represent “sin stocks,” or companies related to alcohol or weaponry for example. But many students and donors would expand this definition to encompass other stocks, such as those related to fossil fuel extraction, a debate that rages on campus, across the country and at home, with a petition for a divestment effortrecently filed by the Environmental Affairs Organization at USC.
But as much as universities have to diversify and possibly divest their investments, so too must donors diversify their donations. To lower tuition rates across the board, to expand research capacities across the country and to preserve and extend the reach of countless intuitions — whether they be private universities or community colleges — private capital must be more encompassing.
As USC embarks upon a new era of greater prosperity and opportunity, it must remain aware that with great endowment comes great responsibility — to the Trojan community and beyond. As the University expands its funds, it must double down on contributing to the international body of research, expanding the accessibility of higher education and serving as a model for a socially conscious private university.  Now that would be a good return on investment.
 
If donated funds are held in trust, there is a fiduciary duty to invest those funds with certain risk and return parameters that probably differ from some people’s social justice goals. Donors may not consider it a good investment in the university if they knew that their funds would be placed in investments subject to whatever way the winds of the liberal agenda happen to be blowing. Encourage this at your own risk — if, for example, certain students actually succeeded in having the university abandon the name of “Traveler” due to some facile connection to the Confederacy, do you think some donors might be a bit upset that a social justice warrior has succeeded in highjacking the school’s tradition and their fond memories? Perhaps enough to vote with their feet and donate elsewhere?
Additionally, are donors supposed to feel bad that community colleges are “squeezed out of access” to donated funds? Or, more appropriately, can we say that donors are free to place their funds at whatever institution is better equipped to carry out their vision of the advancement of society (be it through medicine, finance, law, or the arts), rather than catering to some vague notion of social consciousness?
Telling people, who are willing to donate their money to a worthy cause like improving the education at USC and the university’s stature, how their money should actually be spent is not only counter-productive, it’s arrogant.

Hillary Clinton, former Democratic presidential nominee and the first woman to win the popular vote in the U.S. general election, will release a memoir on the events of 2016 later this month. But excerpts from the book are already garnering wide attention. Clinton has written many books before, examining her tenures as First Lady, and then as Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama. But What Happened promises to be special because Clinton herself has acknowledged that it will be an unfiltered representation of herself. For the first time ever, with nothing to lose, Clinton will not be burdened with the task of sweepingly moderating and repackaging herself to appeal to the members of a patriarchal nation.
Predictably enough, the book is already being criticized across the political spectrum for a number of reasons, some more valid than others. Most notably, many claim fixating on the Russian hacking and former FBI Director James Comey’s scandals distracts the Democratic Party from key issues and further alienates Democratic lawmakers from voters. But on Tuesday, fresh criticism came from the left with the release of a new excerpt in which Clinton discusses her rival in the presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
In either case, Clinton is right about one thing — the Democratic Party’s identity is in crisis, and for better or for worse, a lot of this is because of Sanders and his role in reshaping the direction of the party’s discussion on marginalized identities. 
In the excerpt, Clinton also hits Sanders for not being a Democrat and tackles the sexism of some of his supporters, bringing him to task about the divisiveness of their words and behaviors. “His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives,” she wrote. And of his supporters’ words and actions, she added, “It got ugly and more than a little sexist.”
The discussion of sexism in the primaries is inherently polarizing and emotionally charged. Clinton’s new, defiant spirit shows through just in the fact that she’s daring to weigh in. And considering how ironically marginalized women’s voices are in discussions of sexism, it’s deeply important that she’s the one initiating it.

That being said, I don’t agree with all of her analysis. Sanders brought important ideas to the table for the Democratic Party, such as universal health care, wealth inequality and education as a right — policies that would disproportionately benefit marginalized and low-income Americans. These ideas — as well as a campaign centered on grassroots engagement and cleansing national politics of special interests and corporate corruption — energized a generation of Americans who will canvas, vote and even run for office for years to come. While Sanders’ campaign stirred up debate and disagreement in the party, he shifted the party’s platform to favor once unheard of policies — a path to universal healthcare, decriminalization of marijuana and higher education for all — that could enfranchise millions of Americans. 
He helped the Democratic Party make progress on its core values, and progress will always be worth some conflict and struggle. 
Some of his supporters, however, warrant a discussion of their own. The internalized idea that economic inequity and a purportedly evil political establishment are America’s sole problems, and that racial inequality, discrimination against the LGBTQ community and the national crisis around women’s rights would all evaporate into thin air in a hypothetical, socialist America is nonsense. More than that, it’s offensive to everyone who faces identity-based oppression, which is easy to label and write off as “identity politics” — rather than recognize it as the lived experiences of millions of Americans — only when one has never experienced this oppression firsthand.
Identity-based oppression, economic inequity and bureaucratic corruption coexist as flaws of today’s political system, but a serious problem emerges when a charismatic politician’s rhetoric leads voters to believe there’s only one kind of problem in America, and that talk of all other forms is a “distraction” and a “waste of time.” And intentional or not, that’s exactly what Sanders’ rhetoric did. 
The faction of white, heterosexual, male Bernie supporters, dubbed “Bernie Bros” by their critics, who loathe “social justice warriors” for “distracting” us all with purportedly unimportant matters like respecting gender identity and protecting trans people, share this view with supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Of course, there is a difference between these Trump voters and the “Bernie Bro” wing of Sanders’ supporters. Sanders’ supporters loathe those they perceive as “SJW”s for focusing on identity rather than crusading for socialism. Trump’s supporters loathe “SJW”s because they perceive discussions of identity-based oppression toward the marginalized as oppressive toward white people.
And Clinton is also right about another thing. There’s a quiet, pernicious sexism in the Sanders supporters who frequently tout their action-less “pro-choice” stances to deflect from accusations of sexism, but still disregard abortion rights and family planning resources as important issues relative to the economy. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rates in the industrialized world, and lawmakers in states across the country are fighting with increased success for the right to force women to give birth, but this “women’s issue” is irrelevant in the world of “Bernie Bros.” Without listening to women’s voices on this issue, they swiftly treat those who dare to call attention to it to a lofty lecture on the broken American economy.
California’s Democratic primary took place three weeks after I turned 18, and to say I was ecstatic to cast my first vote for Bernie Sanders would be an understatement. But hindsight is 20/20 — which is, incidentally, the year the next presidential election will take place — and I would not cast my ballot for him again. Today, the Democratic Party is deeply divided about whether or not identity issues matter, about whether or not abortion and gay rights are things worth fighting for or compromising on to win elections and elect economic progressives. And in no small part, this is because of Sanders. 
As a young woman, I watched another woman — a woman who made women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and immigration reform the focuses of her campaign and dedicated more than 40 years of public service to crusading for women’s rights — torn down by a renewed loathing of “social justice warrior” culture that Sanders’ campaign breathed life into. Clinton’s words in her new book speak deeply and personally to me, and because of them I will never forget this particular moment in our nation’s history.

Of course discrimination against women, POC, and LGBT folks matters. But this article sets up a straw man. It simply isn’t the case that the progressives who came out in droves for Sanders don’t care about these things. Do Naomi Wolf and Susan Sarandon not care about women’s issues? Do Spike Lee, Cornell West, and Ta-Nahesi Coats not care about black lives? All Sanders supporters. When people on the left (not to be confused with right wing critics) complain about identity politics, they aren’t making a complaint about issues (every lefty socialist type I know is pro choice and anti-cops shooting black people) but rather they have concerns about the particular methods that a faction of the modern left has employed…call-outs, safe spaces, free speech restrictions, even violence. It’s not an ideological problem, it’s a tactical one. The problem isn’t that SJW’s care about various types of oppression. That is commendable and as it should be. The problem is that some SJW’s act like jerks. And being a jerk is usually not a winning political strategy, at least on the left. No doubt someone will accuse me of “tone policing” or “respectability politics” but no honest scholar of MLK, Ghandi, Harriot Tubman, or Frederick Douglas could imagine them acting like, much less condoning, the approach we see from groups of frankly, highly privileged college kids trying to out oppression each other. This is more a result of social media and helicopter parenting (and lingering effects of the responses to 9/11) than it is some new reality of a uniquely oppressive historical movement. The reality is we, the left, have been winning all the culture war/identity issues for the last half century. The concern is that sheltered, spoiled college kids threaten to undo all that progress. I cheered for the poor, black citizens of Baltimore even as they rioted for Black Lives Matter. But I, and the nation, don’t have so much patience when the children of Yale claim to be similarly put upon. What Sanders offered was not so much a rejection of minority issues, as a rejection of emotion over reason and policy over soundbites. If you recognize the concept of “institutional racism” and “systemic discrimination” then surely you know that some policies create inequalities without ever explicilty mentioning race or sex (voter ID laws or lack of public child care come to mind). But if that’s true, that also means some policies, even those not explicitly mentioning race, sex, LGBT, or any other status identity may well serve some large benefit to those groups in particular. Centralizing how K-12 schools are funded doesn’t seem to mention race but would disproportionately benefit POC. Disarming cops would save black lives. Raising the minimum wage would pull great numbers of women out of poverty. Just because Sanders talks the language of policy doen’t mean he’s not thinking about marginalized people. In fact, I bet if MLK were here today, champion of the Voting Rights and Civil Rights Acts, he’d tell you rational policy action is all that will help these groups. Clinton had a career of policies that hurt these groups, even as she paid occasional lip service to their plights in speeches designed to appeal…to SJW’s.
Hillary does not write anything.  Her staff writes and Hillary periodically supervises.  Fact.
If in her lifetime she ever says anything other than banal, predictable tripe, then wake me.  Unlike Hillary, I will not charge people a dime to read this commentary.
Hillary’s book should’ve been titled WTF Happened. She has blamed everyone she can “recall” as the cause of her failure to win the 2016 presidential election instead of herzelf. She ran a campaign that was flawed, entitled, arrogant and focused on identity politics to start. Most Americans do not care about Identify politics.  They cared about and still do care about the economy, jobe, lower taxes, stopping illegal entry into M our country, rights for all Americans not just LGBT… folks.   The Clintons are flawed people with a nefarious agenda of power, control and building their own wealth through illegal means. They are liars, corrupt and pedophiles. I’ll assume you’re a well read kid in college and have been following the murders of Clinton associates over the years.  Two more found mysteriously murdered since Mark Rich. Therefore, you know what I’m referring to.
There is nothing to idolize about Hillary Clinton unless you idolize a blamer.

As red and gold confetti streamed down onto the field at the Rose Bowl, there was a bittersweet realization for 37 members of the 2016 USC football team: This was the last time they would suit up for USC. Of the 37 players, a handful began to prepare for the NFL draft last May, where five were eventually drafted. However, not all of USC’s draftees will have the opportunity to suit up on Sundays this year. 
Obvious locks to make their team’s 53-man rosters included the dynamic duo of cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who will take the field for the Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively, this year. Jackson, the 18th overall pick, is competing for a starting spot this fall and will be fielding punts and kicks for the Titans. The path to the field is tougher for Smith-Schuster, Pittsburgh’s second-round pick, as he was drafted into a talented receiving corps that includes Antonio Brown, arguably the best receiver in the league.
Defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ seventh-round draft choice, was placed on injured reserve after a season-ending injury to his right knee during the preseason. Undrafted free agent and former USC offensive tackle Chad Wheeler made the New York Giants’ final roster and will be backing up first-round pick Ereck Flowers at left tackle this year. Receiver Isaac Whitney went undrafted in May but was signed by the Oakland Raiders and landed a spot on the team’s practice squad for the 2017 season. Guard Jordan Simmons was also picked up as an undrafted free agent by the Raiders but was later cut from both the final roster and the practice squad. 
Darreus Rogers, another receiver who went undrafted, was signed by the Seattle Seahawks in May but was cut this weekend. He is considered a candidate for making the practice squad if he clears waivers, which he is expected to do. Former Trojan running back Justin Davis will stay in Los Angeles as he was signed by the Rams and earned his way to a roster spot. Davis may have a chance to take up the main backup role this season behind Todd Gurley. Elsewhere in the league, tight end Taylor McNamara was picked up by the Cleveland Browns after the draft but was waived by the team this weekend. The Browns have not released their practice squad roster yet, but McNamara is not expected to earn a spot on it.
Former USC offensive tackle Zach Banner, who was a first team All-Pac-12 selection in 2015, caught a tough break on Sunday. He was waived by the Indianapolis Colts, who selected him in the fourth round of the 2017 draft. Banner initially made the final 53-man roster before he was waived on Sunday to make room for the five other players the Colts claimed after final roster cuts were made around the league. This came as a surprise move from Indianapolis, as Banner played in all four preseason games and was considered a likely candidate to make the roster.  The Cleveland Browns claimed Banner off waivers on Monday. 
Banner was not the only former Trojan to be shuffled around unexpectedly this weekend, with former Buffalo Bills sixth-round pick Kevon Seymour being traded to the Carolina Panthers. Seymour, a cornerback, was traded for former Panthers receiver Kaelin Clay and a future Panthers seventh-round draft pick. Seymour played in 15 games and started three for the Bills last year, and is currently slotted last among five corners on the Panthers’ depth chart. Carolina is a good landing spot for Seymour, who should have an opportunity to compete for playing time amidst the Panthers’ young secondary. 
Safety Leon McQuay III, who intercepted Penn State quarterback Trace McSorley with 27 seconds left in the Rose Bowl, was released Saturday after being drafted in the sixth round by the Kansas City Chiefs. This cut doesn’t come as too much of a surprise given that Kansas City possesses one of the better secondaries in the NFL, led by  former first-team All-Pro and five-time Pro Bowler Eric Berry. McQuay is expected to make the team’s practice squad, however, unless he is picked up by another team. Another Trojan in Kansas City is guard Damien Mama, who was picked up by the Chiefs after going undrafted and signed to the team’s practice squad on Sunday.
Entering the 2016 NFL season, USC had the fifth-most active players in the league with 46 athletes represented. USC leads the way in overall draft picks, with 502 all-time, putting the Trojans just in front of Notre Dame, which has 495. USC’s 80 first-round picks also take the top spot, edging Ohio State, which has produced 77 first-round selections.

Defense wins championships.
We all know that saying. I think it’s probably been plastered onto so many high school football shirts and motivational posters that anyone who’s ever watched or played or even been around sports knows it. Offense wins games, but defense wins championships.
No matter what sport, I’ve always loved defense, perhaps even more than offense. When I played basketball and soccer, there was something satisfying about squaring up an opponent and shutting down any move they tried to make past you. When I watch football and basketball, I live for the hard hits and the showboat blocks.
That might be because of where I’m from. Kansas City is known across the board for teams that specialize in defense — Sporting KC with its indomitable home field atmosphere, the Chiefs with their smash mouth defensive line and Alex Gordon and the Royals and their high-flying antics in the outfield. It’s something the teams and the city takes pride in. And when defense is great, it’s a thing of beauty to watch.
Last Saturday, I don’t think I could use the word “beautiful” to describe most of the USC defense. There were, of course, the highlights of the fourth quarter — that Porter Gustin sack, the Marvel Tell interception — but the game left a bitter taste in the mouths of most fans despite the 49-31 final score.
Entering this season, there has been perhaps too much hype surrounding this USC football team. Yet most of it focused on phenom quarterback Sam Darnold, his offense and his inevitable quest to collect a Pac-12 championship, a national championship and a Heisman trophy in one fell swoop. 
There was a slight rumble in the Coliseum when Darnold took the field for the first time on Saturday, a thrum of expectation that paid off in the opening touchdown drive and then quickly dissipated throughout the frustrating first half. And despite receiving very little of the offseason spotlight, the same expectation still stood for the defense as it took the field.
What unfolded over the first three quarters of the Western Michigan game was, in a word, disappointing. The defensive line found no room to pressure the quarterback, while the secondary blew coverage and the linebackers let running backs slip away with sloppy arm tackles. 
The offense struggled to get off the ground, but they also had no safety net. The defense allowed 263 yards on the ground alone, falling to 113th out of 125 teams in the FBS after the poor outing. The hits weren’t hard and the stops weren’t impressive. For the first time, I felt that the best way to describe the USC defense was “soft.”
There are a lot of excuses that could be made for the defense. Western Michigan was bringing a new head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterback to the Coliseum, and there was little to no film available to prepare the defense. Junior linebacker Cam Smith, who typically leads
in-game adjustments for the Trojans, was confined to the locker room for the first half due to a suspension carried over from the Rose Bowl, leaving the young defense to adjust themselves without one of their captains. 
For all those reasons, it makes sense that team came out to a slow start. But there’s a difference between a slow start and allowing almost 300 yards rushing. Sloppy tackles and lack of energy couldn’t be blamed on a lack of film or a sidelined leader or even the heat. Smith was harsh in his review of the team, saying it had nothing to do with anything except lack of concentration.
“Bad,” he said impatiently to the reporter scrum after the game. “It was really bad.”
Something has to change. The Trojans squeaked out of their season opener with a victory, but the same performance can’t be repeated next Saturday against Stanford. The Cardinal will bring everything that Western Michigan did — scrappy defense, a hard-nosed run game and balanced aerial attack — with the added benefit of Pac-12 talent. 
It’s too early to panic, and first games are historically poor barometers for the future success of football teams. (Just ask any fan who stuck through from the Alabama game to the Rose Bowl last year, if you don’t believe me.) But while many might be ready to sound the alarm while poring over Darnold’s Heisman chances, I’m much more concerned with the defense.
Defense wins championships. It’s cliché. It’s also true. And as USC continues to grind through a tough Pac-12 and non-conference schedule — all without a bye week — it will be the defense, and not the offense, that will be tested the most.
If the Trojans are going to live up to the hype this year, fans will have to hope that a different defense shows up to the Coliseum this Saturday.

Good article. Yes. Defense will do it. need it week after week.
Also, a solid continuous pipeline of A+ recruits coupled with a redshirt strategy is core along with great above average coaching & strong management in the athletic department. SC has 2/3 in place imho. As everyone knows the recruiting pipeline was fractured with NCAA sanctions several years ago but bounced back strong as ever and 3/3 is in the cards. Looking good.
One PS note: However non-athletic departments has underperformed lately(if you get my drift).
Maybe a change in upper university management is needed? No sacred cows. Reputation is huge; students & alumni deserve the best

On Wednesday, the Trojans continued preparation for their clash with No. 14 Stanford. Head coach Clay Helton emphasized third-down efficiency on both sides of the ball while acknowledging the rising prospects of freshman athletes. 
Lewis IV impresses 
During this week in practice, true freshman wide receiver Joseph Lewis IV started getting more and more reps with the starting unit. After not being targeted in Week 1, a breakout week could be in store for the Los Angeles native. Helton even compared him to another former Trojan wide receiver. 
“We all said as a staff that the light just kinda started to click on,” Helton said. “He’s always had that powerful, natural skillset. He kind of reminds me of what JuJu [Smith-Schuster] was to, be honest with you, maybe even a faster version.” 
Defending the run
After giving up 263 rushing yards to a host of Western Michigan running backs, USC’s defense will need a bounce-back performance to contain Stanford star running back Bryce Love, who ran for over 700 yards as Christian McCaffrey’s understudy last season. 
“It was little things [against Western Michigan] like getting out of our gaps too early,” said junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin. “I think we can clean that up. We all saw [what happened] and figured out what we need to change.” 
On Saturday, the Trojans’ defensive line frequently lost at the line of scrimmage, thus opening up running lanes for Western Michigan. Helton noted that highly touted freshman nose tackle Marlon Tuipulotu could play more snaps in order to inject some new energy into the unit. 
“He got 17 reps last week and really graded out well,” Helton said. “He’s had the advantage of being here for a spring so his light clicked on a bit quicker. We’re really proud of where he’s at and we hope that we can bring another big man, Brandon Pili, on also to the point where he can help us out this year.” 
The Trojans also focused on defending third-down situations in order to limit Stanford’s time of possession.
“I think about Stanford defensively, and the limited possessions they give you in a ballgame and how important it is to get off the field,” Helton said. “They are masters of 3rd-and-1 to 5.”

Beginning this semester, students will be able participate in “Towards an Ethically Sensitive Society,” a competition on ethical decision making through the Jerry and Nancy Neely Center for Ethical Leadership.
The competition is open to all USC students, and the institution encourages entries that reflect multiple facets of ethics and strategy.
“There is a misconception that if it is legal, it has to be ethical,” Neely Center Director Ali Abbas  said. “We’ve seen that rules change, so we can’t tie ethical conduct to a legal system that is constantly changing.” 
Abbas emphasizes the intersection of three circles in decision making: ethical, legal and prudential, or to govern oneself through reason. He hopes that the competition will help students analyze ethical dilemmas and ultimately make better decisions.
Submissions may include a variety of mediums, such as written articles, presentations and videos. Students can submit anything from real-life case studies to reflections on ethically sensitive behavior to ethical considerations involving technology.
Abbas said the Neely Center has a lot to learn from students, too.
“This enables us to do multidisciplinary research encompassing three schools [Marshall, Viterbi and Price],” Abbas said. “It is an intellectual convergence that is the result of a very unique opportunity.”
Those who wish to participate in the competition must submit an intent to participate, including a title and brief description of work, by Sept. 30. 
The period from Nov. 15, 2017 to Feb. 15, 2018 will include expert feedback on submissions. Students don’t need to be ethical experts to participate, Abbas said. Everyone is encouraged to apply, so they will receive coaching, guidance and resources to advise their creativity.
Finalists will be announced on March 1, 2018, after which they will have the opportunity to present their submission in the annual Next Generation Ethics Conference, scheduled for March 15, 2018. The winners of the competition are declared at the conference, which includes a $3,000 first prize, $2,000 second prize and $1,000 third prize.

The Marshall School of Business and Leventhal School of Accounting will be coming together to partner with KPMG LLP, a U.S. audit, tax and advisory firm, as part of a new, nine-university large task force. The partnership will result in a new Master’s program: Master of Accounting with Data and Analytics. 
The ground-breaking program allows students to be educated both in and out of the classroom, and there will be a larger focus than ever on technology, according to Leventhal Dean William W. Holder. 
“[Students will be able to] access [KPMG’s] tech, software and algorithms,” Holder said.
The advanced technology will allow USC accountants to be more robustly educated and knowledgeable in their field before even entering the workforce, according to Holder. 
Not only will pupils get a chance to study under USC’s top accounting professors, but they will also be under consideration for competitive spots working at KPMG, according to Marshall News. Additionally, 15 students will receive full scholarships to the program through KPMG, and Leventhal will recruit students with internships at mid-tier and Big 4 accounting firms for the program. 
The joint venture between Leventhal and Marshall’s Data Sciences and Operations Department means that students will be able to access the resources of both schools, as well as opportunities to collaborate with graduate students in USC’s Masters of Accounting and Masters of Business Administration programs. Any student in the Master’s accounting program holding an internship with a top firm can take part in the new Master’s program.
The program is reaching USC and six other schools just one year after its launch, with the incoming class of 2018 already selected due to the aggressive recruiting nature of top-4 accounting firms. The program launched in 2017 at The Ohio State University and Villanova.
“When I learned that USC and KPMG were offering a cutting-edge program that would not only teach me skills that would help me in my career, but also allow me to get a master’s degree, it seemed to be the best of both worlds,” said Loyola Marymount University senior Daryn Kuhlman in an interview with USC Marshall News. She is one of the 15 fully funded KPMG students already accepted for the inaugural class.
USC’s ever-expanding world of opportunities is about to draw in the brightest young minds in accounting, and the school is excited to produce the world’s next wave of well-rounded, highly educated master’s students, according to Holder. 
“We want to be on the cutting edge and will be able to attract better and bett students over time,” Holder said.

The oldest student organization at USC has just appointed its first female director. Kiran Dhillon, a lecturer of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, will now lead the USC Trojan Debate Squad. 
Dhillon was first hired by USC in 2016 as the assistant director of the Trojan Debate Squad. Gordon Stables, the former director of the debate team, is confident in Dhillon’s ability to continue the program’s legacy.
“We were very fortunate to convince her to join the Trojan family and the Debate Squad is well-positioned for a tremendous era under her leadership,” Stables said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Stables also cited Dhillon’s experience in different environments as a notable asset to the debate team going forward.
“Kiran is a remarkable debate scholar and a fantastic educator,” Stables said. “She has a very rare combination of skills and experiences with academic debate in a number of settings.”
Dhillon will be the program’s 12th director, the first woman since the organization’s first director in 1914.From its inception in 1880 until 1914, the program had no director and was entirely student-run. 
The role of women in the leadership of academic organizations is a familiar topic to Dhillon. She invoked an article she co-authored in graduate school called “Biological Sex as a Predictor of Competitive Success in Intercollegiate Forensics.” In her work, , she suggests that increased female presence in the mentoring and advisement of these organizations could help bridge the gap between men and women in forensics.
The Trojan Debate Squad has consistently ranked among the elite debate teams in the country, with the longest consecutive streak of qualifying for the National Debate Tournament at 53 consecutive years, Dhillon said. They expect to have an even stronger season than last year and are projected to rank within the top five, according to Dhillon.
Dhillon has participated in debate since her freshman year in high school. Initially, though, she had her reservations about participating in the debate team. 
“I attended one debate meeting at 15 years old and I thought I wasn’t coming back,” Dhillon said. 
Debate, however, began to pique her interest, and she never turned back.
“I was thrown in as a newbie straight into varsity which was a scary experience, but I stuck with it,” Dhillon said. “There was something about it that I thought was fascinating. The sheer amount of information research that students were doing at 15 years old was fascinating to me and I thought, I want to learn how to do this, even if it’s hard.”
By the time she became a senior in high school, Dhillon said her team became one of the top 16 debate squads in the country. They competed at the Tournament of Champions, an annual debate event held at the University of Kentucky that is considered the most prestigious tournament for high school-level participants.
Dhillon continued to debate competitively through her undergraduate years at the University of Iowa. She then began coaching debate as an assistant coach at the University of Northern Iowa during her master’s program.
Upon reflecting on her role as the first female director, Dhillon mentioned her family, particularly her three younger sisters. 
“For my sisters, it sets the tone that whatever they want to accomplish, they’re very well capable of it,” she said.
Dhillon emphasized how important it is for all aspiring students to have a grasp of public speaking skills. 
“It is a theoretical foundation that I believe sets the tone for just about everything that we want to discuss or accomplish,” Dhillon said.
