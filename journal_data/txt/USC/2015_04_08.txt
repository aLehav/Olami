The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted its weekly Students Talk Back event in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday afternoon. Students and panelists at the event discussed the 2016 presidential election, possible candidates and effective campaign strategies.
Wednesday’s panel featured political consultant and USC Dornsife Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics, Professor Robert Shrum and President of Multiplicity Media Productions Jonathan Wilcox. The panel was co-moderated by Kerstyn Olson from the Unruh institute and Sarah Dhanaphatana, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel covered topics ranging from potential candidates, campaign finances, length of campaigns and modern changes to the presidential campaign process.
Olson posed questions to the panelists about the effect of candidates running early on in the race and what problems may arise from candidates discourse throughout the election season.
Shrum spoke about his experience working on former presidential campaigns, including President John F. Kennedy’s 1960 campaign, and how those compare to modern campaigns.
“When JFK announced in 1960, he announced on January 3rd of that year, and the press wrote about how unprecedented it was to announce that early,” Shrum said. “Ever since then, people have been announcing earlier and earlier. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? It’s an inevitable thing.”
Dhanaphatana discussed the impact of presidential candidates announcing their candidacy this early on before primary elections. She asked both panelists which candidates voters should expect to run in the election. She also asked which crisis communication strategies candidates should consider in light of large national scandals, citing Hillary Clinton’s recent email scandal.
Shrum discussed current campaign challenges, especially fundraising, and how those have forced modern presidential candidates to declare their candidacies earlier on in the election season. Recently announced candidates, such as Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have been forced to announce their intentions to run early in order to keep up with the fundraising power of more established candidates, such as Jeb Bush.
He also commented on the division within the Republican Party between the establishment and insurgents and how that division could influence their selection of a presidential candidate. He explained that Bush, the establishment candidate, could theoretically face a significant challenge by one of the insurgent candidates, such as Rand Paul or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
Wilcox discussed the ways in which the Republican Party will have to adapt in order to improve its public image and appeal to more voters in order to overcome that division.
“They themselves have to make the choice and figure out the balance between the extent to which things now aren’t good enough and how to change, but at the same time, be somebody or a couple of somebodies who the voters can feel good about, not just feel angry towards something else,” Wilcox said.
Panelists also discussed the role that age could play in candidates appealing to one of the largest voting blocs: millennials. Shrum mentioned one argument made by opponents to Clinton that her age alienates her from younger voters and creates a generational divide.
“Listening to my own students, I don’t think that argument has any traction,” Shrum said. “They do not see Hillary Clinton as some sort of throwback to the past … the idea that there’s a translation between candidate’s age and the voters’ decision is dubious at best.”
Wilcox highlighted new challenges, particularly apathy or lack of interest in politics, facing presidential candidates today in gaining support from voters.
“More people are more unhappy, more disagreeable and more distant from politics, politicians and the political system than any time I’ve seen before … so to me, the great candidate going forward is going to have to be inspiring, but at the same time authentic,” he said.
In order to overcome those new challenges, Shrum encouraged better development campaign messages, and he cited President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, and the use of media to encourage voter turnout to highlight the importance of messaging in targeting voters.
“One thing you have to understand when people say they’re building a social media platform or hiring social media experts, as the best of them would tell you, if you don’t have a compelling argument to make to the voters, it doesn’t matter,” Shrum said. “The medium doesn’t matter without the message.”

President Barack Obama named USC Board of Trustees member Wanda Austin to the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on March 24. In their recent press release, the White House named six new nominees for major administrative positions, spanning from Austin’s post to Ambassadors to Cyprus and Benin.
In her new position as councilwoman, Austin will directly advise the president, along with no more than 20 other advisors. The council provides guidance for policies and plans for economic development where extensive knowledge of science and technology is necessary. In order to develop the nation’s science, technology, engineering and math initiatives, Obama seeks the advice of the leaders of the scientific community. In doing so, he plans to make the most informed decisions in terms of allocating budget and boosting the economy.
“I am deeply honored to serve with such an esteemed and talented group of our country’s leading scientists and engineers,” said Austin in a press release from the Aerospace Corporation.
Austin is the president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation. According to the Aerospace Corporation website, the corporation provides consultation as well as technical support for military, civil and commercial customers. The corporation was lauded in the Los Angeles Times as “one of the nation’s most important assets.”
Prior to receiving the degree, Austin earned her bachelor’s degree from Franklin and Marshall College and her doctorate in systems engineering from the Viterbi School of Engineering at USC. In addition to her position at the Aerospace Corporation and her new appointment at the White House, she is a member of the NASA Advisory Council, which provides independent consulting for NASA in their current operations and plans for future projects. She also hold positions on the Board of Trustees of National Geographic Society and National Space Foundation.

In a promising trend towards gender equality in leadership roles, women will hold all three of the top positions in Graduate Student Government at USC for the upcoming academic year.
USC’s graduate student body recently elected President Nikita Hamilton, Vice President Christina Gutierrez and Health Science Campus Director Ayesha Bhatia, who are not only all women, but also women of color.
“There are definitely institutional barriers in equity that affect women, especially women of color,” Gutierrez said. “I look to unequal pay for work, and some of the things within our culture and also within institutions that make it more challenging for women to break beyond that glass ceiling.”
Hamilton cites the persistently uneven demographic distributions in government and the workforce as factors that continue to impede women in stepping up to leadership positions.
“It’s a reflection on our government and work structure,” Hamilton said. “The examples we have of women in power are so few and far between and there are single events, but we’re not putting more initiative to making sure 10 years from now we don’t have that one woman in Congress or five women that are CEOs. That’s not enough. It’s not representative of half the population. It’s not reflective of the actual talent that exists.”
Bhatia believes the lack of female leaders stems from sexist historical norms that continue to fuel resistance.
“I think part of the problem is that girls have always had to work extra hard and overcome everything,” Bhatia said. “We need to stop listening to naysayers and just move on because if we run away they feel like what they’re doing is working.”
Gutierrez said  disproportionate representation in leadership positions can be attributed to the ingrained gender roles of women as domestic figures and caretakers.
“In my urban social policy class last semester we talked a lot about the need for women in the United States to care for families, raising children or caring for elderly family members,” Gutierrez said. “You see women needing to take care of that while simultaneously pursuing careers.”
“Society dictates a lot of what girls can or can’t do,” Hamilton said. “Every time a woman runs for something, they ask who’s going to take care of the kids, but who asks the guy? If you can handle 12 things in the house, why not handle six things at the house and six things in the workplace?”
Bhatia discussed the negative portrayal of women as overly emotional as an additional factor that could be holding them back.
“As a female sometimes I feel like if I show emotions, someone could take advantage of that to get what they want,” Bhatia said. “Men tend to take showing emotions as a sign of weakness.”
The last female graduate student body president was Gould School of Law student Melody Shekari. Unlike the president and vice president of Undergraduate Student Government, in which the two elected females for next year was unprecedented, the genders of GSG leaders have generally teetered back and forth.
“I can only speak to graduate students, but I think for us, it’s really just about who has experience and who’s passionate about doing it,” Hamilton said. “It tends to be mixed with men and women. We’re really time crunched, so it’s just a matter of who’s willing to take the job.”
Hamilton will be entering her third year on the executive board next year. She attributes her success in student government leadership to her ambition, a quality she believes too many women are quick to dismiss.
“It’s a lot of work, and women often underestimate how much they can handle,” Hamilton said. “I was always someone who was doing 20 things. Sometimes we make the word ambitious as being negative for women, but good for men. Why can’t it be good for all of us?”
In the same way men cannot claim to possess leadership qualities women lack, Hamilton does not believe women should identify with uniquely “female” characteristics.
“You hear people saying women are so much better at communication,” Hamilton said. “I don’t think fundamentally girls are better at it. What is it about my biology that makes me better at communicating?”
She emphasized that empowering women should in no way put men down.
“I think when you have that mindset, you’re nurturing women to be better communicators but you’re not working to make sure that men are getting better at it too,” Hamilton said.
Gutierrez said the issue underrepresentation expands beyond just women on campus.
“There’s a disproportionate amount of white male professors and there are only 5 percent black and 12 percent Hispanics in the student population,” Gutierrez said. “It’s important to support each other and build a community together, to share our stories and remember we are also USC.”
Though Hamilton acknowledges this female sweep in GSG is a feat for women’s rights, she concedes it is only a step in the right direction towards the goal of equal representation.
“Women in leadership positions should be celebrated until we reach saturation, or at least higher percentages,” Hamilton said. “In addition to lauding people, we need a ‘We need more’ mantra. Praising women leaders risks becoming proof that we’re fine. It’s fine to celebrate as long as what we’re writing says, ‘We’re not there yet, but we’re a step in the right direction.’”
This story is one of a two part series on women in leadership positions at USC. The second installment will run Friday, April 10.

The Marshall Sports Business Institute hosted NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as a part of its ongoing Commissioners’ Series on Wednesday at Galen Center.
The conversation, which was moderated by David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute and an associate professor at the Marshall School of Business, discussed the current state and future of the NBA, in addition to key accomplishments and challenges he has faced while in his role.
Silver has been busy in his first year as commissioner, handing  down a lifetime ban to former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling in response to racist comments he made in a recorded conversation, in addition to overseeing two separate NBA franchises being sold for record prices.
Silver began by discussing his long journey to the top of the NBA after starting his career there in 1992 as a special assistant to long-time serving commissioner David Stern, who Silver succeeded in February 2014 to become the league’s fifth commissioner. He was unanimously elected by the NBA Board of Governors after previously serving as deputy commissioner.
The commissioner role is Silver’s sixth job at the league, and we elaborated on his ability to  work his way up before moving on to credit Stern for helping him prepare for his new responsibilities and for making the transition process as smooth as possible.
“There’s no ultimate preparation for a job like commissioner or CEO or any jobs like that, until you actually do it — but I would say I was well-prepared as anyone could have been,” Silver said. “There’s a lot that swirls around quickly in this job.”
In 2014, the SportsBusiness Journal ranked Silver at the top of its list of the 50 Most influential People in Sports Business, which might have been attributed to the nine-year, $24 billion television rights deal he helped negotiate with ESPN and TNT.
Silver believes that the value of this media rights deal is only going to rise in the coming years and offered the NCAA tournament, which experienced its highest average viewership in 22 years, as a prime example of its success.
“It’s a really unique form of entertainment and programming and in an increasingly fragmented media world, the value of those premium live sports rights are going to continue to go up, whether on a local basis, national basis, or international basis,” Silver said.
The commissioner added that new technology and emerging platforms that world further enable the NBA the ability to make the game available to more people, which could drive up the value of these media rights in the foreseeable future.
Silver briefly touched on the NBA’s “soft” salary cap system and explained how their revenue sharing model -— players receive 51 percent — is beneficial because the players have the same incentives as the team owners to grow the pie.
“From our standpoint, the more the players make means the better the league is doing and it also means that we are truly partners in this enterprise,” Silver said.
Other topics Silver tackled later in the talk included the role of analytics in NBA front offices, the minimum age for players to enter the NBA Draft and the future of sports betting in professional sports, which he believes can deliver a direct economic benefit to sports.
Silver also left students with some career advice for breaking into the sports industry.
“I never thought I would work in the sports industry,” Silver said. “To me, what always worked was I just put my head down, worked very hard and then just see where it takes me.”
Overall, the conversation — which included a few jokes here and there about Silver’s alma mater, Duke, which won the national college basketball on championship Monday night — was well received by the 300 or so professional, alumni and students at the event.
“I was really grateful that he was as open and candid as he was about some of the more pressing issues that the league is facing, whether it’s upcoming labor relations issues or how to grow the game internationally and how to help put individual markets,” Carter said.
USC students were also content with the direction Silver is taking the NBA, especially when it came to its global development endeavors.
“Commissioner Silver did a really good job highlighting the future opportunities of the NBA both in the United States and around the world,” senior Matthew Prusak said.
Silver announced that the NBA will be playing an exhibition game in Johannesburg, South Africa in August, becoming the first U.S. professional league to play on the continent.
Commissioner Silver’s visit marks the SBI’s eighth Commissioners’ Series event, which is dedicated to hosting high-profile events and presentations involving the leaders of America’s premier sports leagues and organizations.
“We don’t get a lot of exposure to the leaders of the sports industry because we’re here in Los Angeles so every chance we get to have them come here is really great for the university, for our program and I think the students really enjoy it,” Carter said.

The No. 1-ranked women’s golf team will look to remain on top as they head to the PING/ASU Invitational — an event they have won twice in the past — running this Friday through Sunday. This is the final regular season event for USC.
The Invitational, hosted by Arizona State, will be held in Tempe, Arizona at the ASU Karsten Golf Course. This invitational boasts one of the most highly ranked 15-team fields that the Women of Troy have joined this season.
Of the 15 teams, six are representing the Pac-12 — No. 1 USC, No. 2 Washington, No. 3 UCLA, No. 8 Arizona, No. 17 Stanford and host No. 25 ASU. Other schools at the invitational include No. 4 South Carolina, No. 5 Duke, No. 7 Arkansas, No. 16 UNLV, No. 21 San Diego State, No. 27 Baylor, No. 29 Alabama and No. 59 Oklahoma.
Of the 14 other schools, only Baylor, Washington and Duke have bested the Women of Troy with a first place finish in the 2015 season. In their five events this spring, USC has won two and finished second in the other three. On the entire season, the Women of Troy have a total of four wins and seven top-2 finishes.
Beginning bright and early at 8 a.m. on Friday, senior Doris Chen — in her spring debut — junior Annie Park, juniors Karen Chung and Gabriella Then and freshman Amy Lee will take to the course to try and stretch their three-win streak to four.
In the team’s last event, junior Kyung Kim, Park and Lee led USC to a thrilling tiebreaker victory over host Georgia at the Liz Murphey Collegiate Classic.
Earlier this year, the Women of Troy captured their third victory at the Arizona Wildcats Invitational over host Arizona. Chung secured her second career collegiate crown with her first top-10 finish of the season. With an under-11 finish, Chung was the first Trojan to finish in the double-digits this season. Her victory made her the third Trojan this season to win a tournament; Park, a two-time All-American, and Then won earlier in the season.
At the Arizona tournament, USC captured victory with a 30-under 834 (280, 271, 283) performance. The Women of Troy’s showing in the second round earned them a school-record on a par 72 course of 17-under — the second-lowest total in school history.
If they can continue to play at that high of a level, they will capture their second title at an invitational in the Arizona desert.
The current success for the Women of Troy is nothing out of the ordinary for these ladies. Of the team’s past 25 outings, USC has taken the top spot in 16 outings, 19 of 29 and 20 0f 31, the first win coming from the           fall of 2012.
While the Women of Troy are no strangers from winning as a team, they are more than familiar with victory individually. Both Park and Chen are NCAA individual champions: Park captured her title in 2013, and Chen captured hers in 2014.
Chen will be looking to close out her senior regular season with a big finish. As a three-time All-American and 2012 Pac-12 individual champion, she had had a vital impact on the Women of Troy’s success on the course. In 2013, she was key in clinching USC’s NCAA championship — USC’s third title in program history.
As this season’s closure draws near, the Women of Troy have their sights set on post-season play. First come the Pac-12 Championships, then the NCAA Regional Championship and lastly, the NCAA Championships.
Sitting at No. 1 in the nation, if the Women of Troy continue to top other teams out on the course, they are on the right path to make it back to the NCAA Championships.
A trip to the championships will avenge their two-stroke loss to Duke last year when they just missed out on a second-straight national title and fourth in program history.
Before any of that can happen though, the Women of Troy will have to continue to be efficient out on the course to capture their fourth win in a row this season and garner momentum as they head into the postseason.

I’ve got a fever and the only prescription is not more cowbell — sorry, Christopher Walken. Rather, I think the only cure here is a national championship from one of our USC athletics teams this spring.
USC has won at least one national team championship every year for the past eight years, which means the last year without a team title was 2006. Prior to the current streak, at least one team had won a national team title from 2001 to 2005.
Therefore, in the past 14 years, USC has won at least one championship in every  year but one.
As the school year begins to wind down, though, even I am beginning to get a little bit anxious as to whether our teams will be able to extend this unprecedented streak.
The Trojan faithful shouldn’t stress too much, though, because I’m not going to let this happen on my watch, and it appears that one of the USC spring sports teams is here to save the day.
Fortunately, for the sake of the streak, many of these teams are currently on fire, and it doesn’t look like firefighters are putting it out any time soon.
For starters, the Easter bunny seemed to be a good luck charm for USC teams this past weekend, as they went a perfect 10-0, with almost all of these wins coming against conference opponents.
As of April 1, USC had 11 teams that were ranked in the top-10, and three were ranked as the top team in the land.
Statistically speaking, USC has a relatively good chance of keeping the streak alive as long as one of these scorching teams can pull off a natty. The big question, though, is which one of these team has the best shot of winning a title in their respective sports?
There’s no doubt that a program that has caught much of our attention this spring is the USC baseball team, which currently owns its highest ranking since 2006 at No. 6. They kicked off the season as one of the hottest teams in all of collegiate baseball with a 12-0 start. They also sent a message to the rest of the nation early on after beating three of the nation’s best programs: TCU, Vanderbilt and crosstown rival UCLA, at Dodger Stadium.
The team has, indeed, carried the momentum into conference play by winning each of its three series in conference, including a sweep of Arizona, the first time they accomplished that feat since 2001.
The Trojans have a crucial Pac-12 series coming up at home this weekend against the Bruins, and while I think USC is in a great position to win a conference title and get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 under third year-skipper Dan Hubbs, I don’t think they will be able to get through the gauntlet that makes up the postseason in collegiate baseball. It would be a huge accomplishment in itself even if the Trojans reached to the College World Series in Omaha.
To be honest, I think it will be one of the Women of Troy teams that will save the day in the end.
I wouldn’t be surprised at all if either women’s sand volleyball, women’s golf or women’s tennis, which all currently boast No. 1 rankings, are able to win titles in their respective sports
The sand volleyball team, still  in just its fourth season under head coach Anna Collier, is probaly the hottest team at USC right now.
Currently boasting a perfect 15-0 record and coming off a huge win over defending champion Pepperdine at their home sand on Zuma Beach,  the Women of Troy are poised to become the new queens of the sand, should they be able to keep up their high level of play.
The only caviat here would be that women’s sand volleyball doesn’t become a full-fledged NCAA championship sport until next year.
Moving on, the top-ranked women’s tennis team has also been on top of its game lately with its current eight-match winning streak.
In the process, the Women of Troy have knocked off a number of ranked Pac-12 foes, putting them in good shape as they close out their regular season at home before moving onto the conference and NCAA Tournaments.
Also, on the men’s side, you can never count out head coach Peter Smith and his squad, who won four consecutive national titles leading up to 2013 and then secured USC’s 100th  NCAA Championship in 2014.
Finally, when you’re talking about legendary head coaches, you can’t go without talking the one and only Jovan Vavic and the water polo dynasty he has built.
The No. 3 ranked Women of Troy, which is led by the program’s all-time leading scorer in senior Monica Vavic, is currently on a six-game winning streak and is hungry to return to the national title game after losing to UCLA in the semifinals in 2014.
The program took home the national title the year before in 2013.
I really hope that these teams don’t let me down after I just talked them all up so much, but that’s honestly how confident I am in these teams’ ability to deliver in the postseason.
In an attempt to channel my inner Pat Riley, I feel so grateful to be a Trojan, and I’m guaranteeing to all USC fans that  at least one of these varsity teams will win a title this spring and keep the streak alive. Can you dig it?

The No. 1 Women of Troy, who are off to their best start in program history, will play in their final home stand of the season against the Loyola Marymount Lions and San Francisco Dons at Merle Norman Stadium on Thursday.
Last Friday, the Women of Troy went to Zuma Beach to play No. 4 Pepperdine, and once again they defeated the Waves 3-2.
This was the first time in four years, the Waves lost a dual match at home. Sophomores Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes sealed the victory for the Women of Troy with a two-set victory, avenging their previous loss against Pepperdine’s No. 1 pairing.
Being ranked No. 1 in the country and being undefeated with a 15-0 record, the Women of Troy have a target on their backs. Head coach Anna Collier isn’t worried about their record and loves being undefeated.
“I think being undefeated speaks to confidence,” said Collier. “The team isn’t afraid of the target on their backs. They [opponents] know we’re good, come after us, you beat us you beat us and if you don’t you don’t.”
Since it is the final home match of the season for the Women of Troy, they will also have senior day to celebrate all the accomplishments of the senior class. The graduating class includes seniors: Bria Russ, Meg Norton, Eve Ettinger, Alexa Stonish and Emily Young. Both Russ and Ettinger were part of the original team, and they have built the program into what it is today.
“Well we used to practice on the beach a lot,” said Ettinger. “These court we play on are awesome to have and our program has gotten a lot better. I’m super excited to finish out our season strong like we have been doing well. I can’t wait.”
Even though its senior day, both Loyola Marymount and San Francisco come into Merle Norman Stadium with the hopes of upsetting the top-ranked Women of Troy.
The Loyola Marymount Lions will be playing the Women of Troy for a third time, while this will be the first time San Francisco faces off against USC in sand volleyball.
In LMU’s first two duals against USC, they lost 4-1 both times, and they have not played since they lost to USC back on April second. Since their last dual match, the Lions have fallen out of the top 10 and currently their overall record sits at 2-8. One bright spot for the Lions is that their top pairing of senior Betsi Metter and freshman Sarah Sponcil were able to defeat Claes and Hughes twice this season.
“We really want our ones to play well,” said Collier. “LMU’s ones are good and they both are on the junior national team and they have traveled to play. We need to make sure we come out and play better.”
For the Women of Troy’s second opponent, the San Francisco Dons will be enjoying their first trip outside of Northern California this season. So far on the season, San Francisco has a record of 8-5 and they are coming off wins against No. 13 Pacific as well as Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
The Dons have had some struggles at their top pairing, where junior Courtney Sabahi and senior Valentina Zaloznik have been battling to keep their position. Sabahi and Zaloznik are only 7-6 in duals, while the No. 2 pairing of freshman Jessica Gaffney and junior Sara Staengle are 9-4 on the season.
The first dual against LMU starts at 2:30 pm followed by San Francisco at 4 p.m.

Winners of eight of their last nine games and boasting a perfect 4-0 record in conference play, USC women’s lacrosse will look to keep their winning ways intact this weekend in their final home matchups of the regular season.
The Women of Troy return to McAlister Field after a two-week, three-game stretch on the road in which they played games against Dartmouth (W, 9-7), then-No. 2 Boston College (L, 16-12) and Oregon (W, 13-11).
During the stint, a duo of sophomore attackers — Michaela Michael and Cynthia Del Core — nearly combined for over half of the team’s total goal output. Both were especially locked in against Oregon, in which each girl scored four goals apiece, with Del Core converting each of her four shot attempts into points.
Also notable during the post-spring break stretch was the play of junior midfielder Amanda Johansen, who stuffed the stat sheet to its breaking point with six goals, seven ground balls, nine draw controls wins, three forced turnovers and three assists. Johansen was named MPSF Offensive Player of the Week for her efforts in the Boston College and Oregon matchups, the first time she has won the award in her career.
Junior attacker and team scoring leader Caroline de Lyra was also productive, scoring five goals of her own and assisting on six others. Freshman goalie Gussie Johns made 19 saves while staying active and alert around the net with 12 ground ball pick-ups.
Now home, the Women of Troy turn their sights toward two weekend visitors from the Centennial State, as Colorado and Denver will visit Southern California in hopes of ruining USC’s bid for a perfect conference record.
The Buffaloes enter Friday’s match with a 6-4 record after dropping a close match to  No. 13-ranked Stanford, 16-14, this past Sunday. All four Colorado losses this year have been to ranked opponents, an indication that they will be battle-tested when they square off with USC.
The loss to Stanford dropped the Buffs to 1-2 in the MPSF conference after falling in their Feb. 11 matchup with then-No. 19 Denver 10-6 before beating UC Davis 13-5 on April 3 to earn their first conference victory of the season.
Leading the Buffs will be two dynamic playmakers in sophomore attacker Johnna Fusco and freshman midfielder Darby Kiernan, who lead the team with 35 and 30 points, respectively. A majority of those points have been amassed through goals, as 31 of Fusco’s 35 points and 24 of Kiernan’s 30 have come via scoring shots, rather than assists. Kiernan also leads the team with 19 ground balls and has 24 draw controls, while Fusco boasts 27 draw controls of her own.
Also noteworthy for Colorado are sophomore midfielder Marie Moore (18 ground balls, 31 draw controls) and dangerous freshman midfielder Blair Sisk (19 goals, 14 draw controls). In goal for the Buffs will be sophomore Paige Soenksen, who has made 86 saves this season while surrendering 91 goals.
Sunday’s matchup with Denver will be the last home game of the regular season for the Women of Troy before playing games at UC Davis on April 17, No. 15 Stanford on April 19 and San Diego State on April 25 leading up to the MPSF Tournament beginning on April 30.
The Pioneers will enter Sunday’s contest following a Friday bout with San Diego State. Currently, their record sits at 7-3 overall and 2-1 in the MPSF conference, with their aforementioned February victory over Colorado and an April 5 home win against UC Davis, 9-5. The team lost at home to then-No. 13 Stanford, 14-7, on April 3.
Denver will be lead offensively by senior attacker Jill Remenapp, who has tallied 32 points on 14 goals and 18 assists, and redshirt freshman attacker Nicole Martindale, who has 22 points on 17 goals and five assists.
A trio of seniors in midfielders Kiki Boone (16 goals, 23 draw controls, 11 ground balls, seven caused turnovers) and Rachael Dillon (12 goals, 21 ground balls, 11 draw controls, seven caused turnovers) and defender Ali Proehl (18 ground balls, 13 caused turnovers) lead the rest of what is a very scrappy bunch for the Pioneers, who at one point were ranked as high as 19th in the nation earlier this season. Guarding the goal for Denver will be redshirt senior Hannah Hook, who has made 87 saves while allowing 90 scores this year.
The weekend contests will likely be the last opportunity to see the Women of Troy at home this year. Friday’s game against Colorado kicks off at 3 p.m., while Sunday’s matinee with Denver is set to begin at 12 p.m.

John Hancock is the first life insurance company to offer something this radical to American consumers — let the company monitor your health on a Fitbit tracker you wear and pay less on your life insurance premiums. At first glance, the proposal seems far-fetched, but there’s promise for positive change in between the lines.
In most life insurance companies, premiums are determined after employees review a snapshot of your health: you go in, document your family history and state your existing health conditions such as high cholesterol or hypertension. From that point on, your premiums are fixed. The problem with human health, however, is that it doesn’t remain static. If you decided that you wanted to do something about your health problems and started exercising regularly to improve your health, your premiums would remain high.
John Hancock and its partner company, Vitality, aims to solve this problem by offering premiums tailored to each individual’s present health. In exchange for wearing a free Fitbit monitor, which monitors your activity levels at the gym and sends the information back to the insurance company, you can receive up to a 15 percent discount on your premiums. The more you exercise, the lower the premium you pay because statistically, you have a greater chance of living longer. Tie exercise to decreasing premiums and people are incentivised to improve their own health. It’s a win-win situation as you can continue to live a long, fruitful life while the company is less likely to have to pay for your premature death.
While many people might balk at the idea of giving out unnecessary personal information to life insurance firms for fear of hacking or privacy concerns, John Hancock doesn’t force you to provide any information. Those who prefer the more traditional means of determining premiums can simply continue with a process that they’re comfortable. But for those who see potential benefits and want to take the leap, this revamped premium payment system might just rejuvenate the declining life insurance industry and create a new precedent for how life insurance is provided in the U.S.

The world of social media and app production expands every time someone logs on to iTunes or Apple. USC alumnus Ben Rolnik, along with a group of others, has created an app called Vida that opens new doors in social media. In essence, the app aims to connect people in proximity to each other by presenting a quick, easy way to present their online presences.
Compared to the average social media app, Vida offers a positive and encouraging space for the world of friendship. Co-founder Rolnik said that the vision for Vida surrounds a “friendship revolution.” This idea spawned from his own days at USC as a social butterfly who wanted to get to know as many people as possible.
He believes that through Vida, one can start a more personal relationship that traditional social media rejects through its focus on fame and celebrity. Rolnik said Vida is a next generation social network that aims to encourage a culture of love and friendship, with an ultimate goal of facilitating peace between people.
“A lot of people have become their own personal celebrities. However, most people you meet aren’t superstars,” Rolnik said. “They are molecular biologists and interns and artists.”
Through Vida, one can be brought into creative union through social media with these intelligent, strong individuals in a way that transcends the traditional artistry behind social networking.
“When you are out at a coffee shop or a grocery store, especially at a school campus, 99 percent of the people around you are your classmates and peers. People you don’t know at all.”
Vida seeks to break the walls between these strangers. As a USC alumnus, Rolnik envisions USC becoming the most social campus in the nation through this platform of social networking.
“I remember when Facebook first came out and how exciting it was to communicate with people in such a fast and accessible way,” Rolnik said.
What most interests Rolnick is how technology has achieved a status of proscribing public identities. Through their public identities, young people have been able to share so much about themselves online. Each and every one of the “friends” you have on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat all experience the most influential and sometimes private aspects of your life, Rolnik said.
He believes social media discourages face-to-face interaction because people have become so comfortable in their online public identities.
“A lot of people, although they know someone on social media, have issues connecting in person, or have an awkward social attitude because they are not used to the face-to-face interactions,” Rolnik said.
Vida works as a Bluetooth-like application that links people instantaneously so that users can connect in person and discuss different parts of their lives via their Instagram pictures or Facebook posts.
Despite the positive vibes surrounding this project, Rolnik acknowledged the challenges faced in its conception.
“In contrast with traditional social media that leverages with an existing ‘hub,’ we had to create a new technology,” he said.
Rolnik and his team created a Bluetooth network to connect its users in a faster and more secure way.
“It’s almost like a Shazam version of social networking; it allows you to remember people a lot more easily,” he said.
In terms of the future of Vida itself, Rolnik says the plan is to serve people and humanity.
“Many people feel uncomfortable in social situations,” he said. “That moment people can embrace new situations everywhere they go and understand that no matter where they are, they have a friend, is when social awkwardness will start to change.”
Sometimes these are people you don’t know or haven’t met yet, but the comfort is that they are waiting to be discovered by other Vida users. This comfort is what he hopes Vida users will channel to expand positive energy and friendship, Rolnik said,
Rolnik credits USC to much of his success.
“I firmly believe we have some of the most intellectually creative students,” he said. “Not only is USC remarkable in the area of media and communications, but technology and innovation as well.”
Through USC, Rolnik also has experienced shared colleagues and business partners that have been part of and succeeded through the Trojan family.
USC also is important to the expansion of Vida as it will hopefully come to permeate the campus as a portal for friendship.
“What makes me more excited than anything in terms of Vida is what my life would have been like if I had this app on my first day as a freshman,” Rolnik said. “Hopefully Vida will come to be a pervasive and positive force not only at USC, but among all young people.”

The Church of Scientology is a Hollywood institution. Sure, according to its website, Scientology an international religion with 15 million members worldwide, but the smattering of Scientology-owned buildings in Hollywood, including their West Coast headquarters, would suggest otherwise. Los Angeles also boasts the largest concentration of Scientologists, including some of the belief’s most prominent members, such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta.
As a local of the Church’s domain, I’ve always been intrigued by the towering Scientology sign above its primary Hollywood Boulevard building. People frequently joke about Scientology in passing, but I’d bet that when prodded, most people wouldn’t be able to describe what the Church actually believes.
I decided that it was my journalistic duty to dive in and investigate. But then Lawrence Wright’s book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, and its accompanying film adaptation, beat me to it.
But, I still wanted to enter that towering Hollywood Boulevard building under the prestigious Church of Scientology sign. So, I visited the L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition, which promised the ability to follow Hubbard’s “extraordinary path of achievement” through over 30 different displays and presentations.
As we approached the museum, I was surprised to find members of the supposedly secretive and secluded church standing out on the curb, soliciting passerby, just like a Hollywood tour bus guide or nightclub owner. But even with the soliciting, my friends and I were still the museum’s only visitors for the duration of our time there.
The tour began with an introductory film about, well, the life of L. Ron Hubbard. If you didn’t know, before founding what the video calls “the largest major religion founded in the 20th century” — in other words, the only major religion founded in the 20th century — he was an accomplished science-fiction writer. With over 1,000 works, Hubbard holds the Guinness World Record for most published works by one author.
And before both his writing and religious career, he was apparently accomplished at everything. A college graduate, Hubbard dabbled in nuclear physics before finding a passion in writing. According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was America’s youngest Eagle Scout, one of the pilots and an accomplished Naval Officer who won a Purple Heart award. He even became the blood brother of the medicine man of a Montana Native American tribe at the age of six.
It doesn’t take an investigative journalist to test the veracity of these claims. Though it’s difficult to find an exhaustive anthology of the blood brothers of Montana medicine men, a quick Google search reveals Hubbard’s Navy records. According to online sources, Hubbard received neither a Purple Heart nor a college degree.
While the museum’s primary function is to recognize Hubbard’s life and accomplishments, his biggest accomplishment was founding the church — the very church that runs the museum. As such, the museum seems to serve a second function, allowing members a way to teach non-members about their beliefs, diffusing any circulating rumors that portray the Church of Scientology in a negative light.
We discovered this soon after beginning our tour, when our tour guide asked, “Have any of you guys heard that we’re with aliens?” She allowed a brief response from us — I barely mustered a nod — before answering her own question. “Well, we’re not. That’s a rumor.”
So what does the Church of Scientology believe? That remained a mystery for most of the tour, which focused on the life of Hubbard, rather than his religion.
Midway through the tour, we were introduced to the “Vice President of Scientology,” who came bearing informational materials for the media. I naively hoped they’d be a complete guide to the church’s beliefs. Instead, the pamphlets focused entirely on the humanitarian work of church members, with little to no mention of the church’s practices.
Luckily, we were then shown another video, this one about the church. The video explained that Scientology can help remove the memories of negative past experiences, creating a clear mind. How do they do this? I don’t know; apparently that’s in another video.
Finally, we got to the museum’s grand finale, the Electropsychometer, or e-meter.  If you judge the L. Ron Hubbard Museum only by its Yelp reviews, you’d think that the only item in the museum is the e-meter, which Yelpers rave over.
The e-meter features one needle that moves from left to right. It’s meant to measure whether a person has been relieved from their negative experiences, providing a starting point for future Scientologists. Our guide asked us questions, like “What is something that stresses you out?”, and as we thought of our answer, the needle moved to the right.
I’m neither a scientologist nor a scientist, but this process didn’t make any sense to me. Like all the other aspects of Scientology I witnessed at the L. Ron Hubbard Life museum, the e-meter raised more questions than it answered.
If you’re looking for an all-inclusive Scientology experience that teaches you every aspect of the religion, the Hubbard museum probably isn’t for you. But if you’re looking for an afternoon of confusion with a hint of propaganda, you’re in for a good time.

Just about every religion will give you their holy book, which lays out their principles.  Scientology will charge you for Dianetics, the book that Scientology is supposedly based upon, yet it doesn’t describe the tortured and expensive path to the highest levels of Scientology.
Just yesterday, it was offered to me for $25 on Hollywood Boulevard.  It is written in a turgid, breathless style favored by pulp fiction writers of the 1930s and 40s.  It makes all sorts of claims that are described as scientific, yet nothing in it is peer reviewed, and no reports are available, other than anecdotal evidence, provided by L. Ron Hubbard.
Indeed, Scientology claims that the Holocaust was caused by psychiatry in another museum they operate close by.  They will tell you about their anti-drug efforts, but that includes the banning of anti-psychotic, and anti-depressant drugs, and even advocate not using anti-seizure drugs.
They also follow and harass members who want to leave, as well as those who have left, and even people who have never been in but are critical of their actions.
What a “religion.”  It’s really designed as a con, based on the fears of its leader.
“Have any of you guys heard that we’re with aliens?” She allowed a brief response from us — I barely mustered a nod — before answering her own question. “Well, we’re not. That’s a rumor.”
There’s the much vaunted Scientology Communication “Tech” in full flower. Tour Guide asks and answers her own question– one purposely worded to allow a response that tries to make Scientology seem reasonable.
Scientologists are not “with” aliens, do not worship aliens, do not believe we are descended from aliens, or even believe we are possessed by aliens. They do, however, believe that humans are infested with the “thetans” (spirits) of dead aliens that have been on Earth for millions of years.
So there.
For the record, the Tribe that Hubbard was supposed to be a blood brother to does not practice blood brotherhood and never heard of him until after he was dead. He flunked physics and dropped out of college after a year. He came very close to being court-martialled in the Navy and caused an international incident with Mexico. The e-meter is a skin galvanometer, similar to one used in lie detectors (and serves the same purpose). The Church has 50,000 members worldwide at most, and only 25-30,000 in the US.; peak world membership was <100,000 in the 1980's. Finding out what they believe costs money; pay as you go, keep what you learn a strict secret. There are no aliens as such: we are the aliens. Our thetans were brought to this prison planet from the overpopulated Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago by Xenu. Aboard rocket-powered DC-8's. The people in the Church who you spoke with probably haven't progressed to that level yet, so they didn't know they were lying. I hope you didn't give them your address and phone number. Good article… Cheers!!   :-)
A tidy summation of Hubbard’s epic, bodacious con.
The internet is Scientology’s enemy.  A quick Googling of most any of the contentions made about Hubbard’s life by the CoS will find them to be out-and-out fabrications or wildly overblown exaggerations.  Funny how Hubbard was supposedly this great genius, yet could not forsee the internet that would be the downfall of his “religion.”

As a live show, ODESZA has been an act that believes in the value of live improvisation and human performance. It has shed the restrictions of a DJ set for a live setup that allows them to remix the group’s entire discography, creating new combinations of its sounds to fit each crowd. 2015 will be a banner year for the duo: they’re returning to Coachella for the second year in a row, this time on the main lineup, as they continue their worldwide takeover as part of the In Return tour. While they’re in California, they’ll be performing a number of more intimate shows around the region, including a show this Thursday at the Glass House in Pomona. In anticipation of this performance, Harrison Mills of ODESZA spoke about the group’s crazy journey over the past couple years and their plans for the show at Pomona.
For previous shows, each member would be on his own laptop, with Mills controlling melodies and his partner Clayton Knight handling drums and bass. This time, though, they’re consolidating into one live session so they can both have complete control to remix any of the elements in their music. Mills highlighted the compatibility of their stage presence, and the importance of their partnership. “I would say we complement each other in a lot of different ways. At first, I didn’t really like dance music, but Clay was super into dance music. He made me find the more abstract dance music that made me like that music more, especially pop music. Now we have so much of the same music that we share back and forth.”
Mills described his budding musical tastes before ODESZA as deeply rooted in hip-hop, citing The Notorious B.I.G., Nas and A Tribe Called Quest as influences, among others. Whereas Clayton was more traditionally trained in classical music, Mills learned the art of electronic music through the technology he interfaced with.
“I stuck with feeling and went with more of emotion than going for a jazzy chord progression that would be harder for me to play,” he recalls, adding that working together improves each other’s abilities to bring forth their style of expressive music.
Given that the duo has been touring continuously for more than a year, they spoke on whether had been inspired by the cultures they experienced while on tour, considering the influence of their home roots in earlier albums.
“I would say more music scenes have impacted me more than the actual locations, mainly because when you tour a lot, unfortunately you really don’t get to see much,” Mills said. “But I would call Australia our second home. We have a lot of real close musician friends out there. It’s one of the only places we’ve gone abroad and went into the studio with someone and been inspired by the energy that’s there. There’s something in the water.”
MIlls also spoke about the challenges ODESZA faced in the past, and how that has impacted their outlook on the future.
“The biggest roadblock was probably learning how the music business works, and also realizing you’re not going to be home for a long time. It’s really hard to cope with knowing that if you want to really take up every opportunity, you’re not going to have a life outside of music for a long time. But it’s definitely worth it, not something I regret whatsoever, and it’s been a really awesome ride,” Mills said.
ODESZA will be playing a number of California stops during these next two weeks, including sets in Pomona, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, Indio and Arcata.

Seventy-six percent of high school seniors reach the finish line of their K-12 education victorious, with acceptance letters from their top-choice college in hand. Nearly 25 percent of these accomplished graduates, however, must forgo attending their top-choice school due to insufficient financial aid.
These are hard-working students — students who slaved over application essays, buried themselves in extracurriculars and toiled through the grind of high school. Sadly, these 25 percent of students are blocked from attending their top choice school not because they didn’t earn it, but because they can’t afford it. USC can help these students who dream of joining the Trojan family by expanding its financial aid options.
Stanford announced this week that it would offer free tuition to families with annual incomes below $125,000. Additionally, students from families making less than $65,000 are eligible to receive free room and board. This announcement demonstrates a strong commitment to students and a recognition that finances should not be a factor in college decisions.
Stanford isn’t alone. Tuition breaks for middle-class families are becoming a commonality among prestigious institutions. Princeton and Dartmouth offer free tuition to families making less than $120,000 and $100,000, respectively, while Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Yale and MIT all have free tuition cutoffs for families with incomes below $60,000-$75,000. Meanwhile, USC currently has no minimum income for free tuition.
In order to continue attracting bright, high-achieving students, USC must rethink its financial aid policies and take steps to offer a similar program. USC has long held the tongue-in-cheek moniker of “University of Spoiled Children,” a nickname which could be here to stay as other schools increasingly offer stronger financial aid packages to lower-income and middle-income students.
USC has increased its economic diversity of late, but this trend will come to a screeching halt if middle-class students are forced to take out loans here but not elsewhere. Increasing financial aid options would prove that USC wants students who can contribute to a thriving learning environment, not just students who can pay.
One of the most fundamental concepts of economics is competitive pricing, a concept which USC blatantly ignores. With any product, from cars to diapers, consumers consider the price compared to similar items. Though the tuition of other elite schools is comparable to USC’s, generous financial aid like Stanford’s results in a significantly lower final price.
Instead of making its final price tag competitive with other schools, USC practically labels itself as commodity. Alongside the listing of USC’s tuition on the school’s website reads the description, “Terrific students taught by a great faculty on a beautiful campus in an exciting location,” an apparent attempt to justify the university’s high price. When it comes to education, however, a high price tag does not necessarily mean high quality. If that were the case, then the Ivies’ free tuition would characterize them as low quality.
A high price tag will never be an attraction point for students, no matter how it’s justified.
In a statement regarding Stanford’s decision, the school’s provost, John Etchemendy, explained, “Our highest priority is that Stanford remain affordable and accessible to the most talented students, regardless of their financial circumstances … these enhancements will help even more families, including those in the middle class, afford Stanford without going into debt.”
The key words are “without going into debt.” While other private schools are combating high price tags by eliminating them altogether, USC embarrassingly giving middle-income students to fend for themselves, usually leaving them no choice but to take out loans.
The main page of USC’s financial aid website boldly claims, “Cost should not be the primary factor in your decision to apply or to attend.” As with other institutions, the final price tag prospective Trojans face is usually significantly lower than the official tuition price.
But while other institutions lower costs through grants, scholarships and waivers, USC’s price tag is often lowered by daunting loans. For high-achieving middle-class students faced with the choice of a free education or a lifetime repaying student loans, cost will inevitably become the primary factor, driving otherwise deserving students away from our institution and accessible to the most talented students, regardless of their financial circumstances … these enhancements will help even more families, including those in the middle class, afford Stanford without going into debt.”
USC needs to put their own money — not money from private and federal loans — where its mouth is and offer tuition breaks to the students who need them.
One could argue that institutions like Stanford can offer free tuition because their endowment is larger than that of USC. Schools with endowments closer to USC, however, are also offering free tuition programs. Dartmouth is one such example, with a $4.4 billion endowment, compared to USC’s $4.5 billion.
Granted, Dartmouth’s endowment supports a smaller student body than USC. USC, however, is no stranger to raising money. When USC wants something, it finds a way to fund it. USC’s administration should dedicate the same effort they place toward funding new buildings to assisting students with tuition, which would demonstrate a genuine commitment to students.
And new construction and new students aren’t mutually exclusive; a policy which sets aside a certain percentage of all donations towards scholarship initiatives could supplement USC’s already comparatively large endowment. Additional funds could come from redistributing merit and SCion award money away from high-income students who don’t actually need it, among other options.
USC prides itself on being both academically and athletically competitive. It is now time to be economically competitive. Before wowing prospective students with a winning football team or shiny new academic facilities, USC needs to show high-achieving students they recognize their worth.
My son had to make a choice between Stanford and USC. Our income was just over the $100,000 threshold to qualify for free tuition at Stanford, but USC offered him a half-tuition merit scholarship. Stanford offers no merit scholarships. So even though Stanford is more prestigious and would have been his first choice, my son chose USC. Even at our income, we could not afford four years of Stanford at full tuition, and are grateful for the merit scholarship USC offered, allowing him to graduate without a massive amount of debt.
USC was extremely generous with me and my friends who got in. Some received scholarships, and I received nearly a full ride in grants. I only had to pay $5000/yr, and $2500 of it could be paid through work study. I am so grateful for the opportunity to attend what would have been totally unaffordable. 
David’s analysis below is correct.    Had the author achieved the same level of thought an insight, she might not even have written this article.  When all factors are considered, properly, USC has historically always offered very generous financial aid packages including full, free rides.
All of this aside, I’m forced once again to question the author’s premise in the first place.   While it is indeed important for universities to offer strong financial aid to qualified students (including full scholarships where appropriate), I’m not sure it’s right or appropriate at all to suggest that just because a student “slaved over application essays” or “buried themselves in extracurriculars” or “toiled through the grind of high school” that they are entitled to their first choice college.  A student who is truly qualified (not only in the terms outlined by the author but also armed with spectacular grades and GPA), will find acceptable tuition assistance at any number of quality institutions.  It just smells like more entitlement mentality.  Young people today want everything their way, in their time, and apparently free… or as close to free as possible.  The only thing we are entitled to as citizens is education through high school.  Anything beyond that is subject to the same elements of competition, capitalism, and sacrifice as anything else.  This should only seem harsh to a juvenile; An applicant for college should embody the maturity to understand and appreciate this.
Interesting, are you aware of any of the statistics regarding the average student’s accomplishments at USC? Bear in mind that as time progresses, generations become more intelligent and generally accomplish more. Recent incoming classes exemplify this. Also, before you judge the entitlement of my generation, consider that we are asking only for the same opportunities as the generation that created this disaster for us. Prior to this “entitled generation,” it was actually feasible for a student to finance their entire education with little to no loans and/or scholarships. They could work summer jobs and ~20 hrs/week during the year. I do that now and can’t make a dent in my loans included with my “free ride.” This is where the fine print comes in handy in terms of their “generosity.” God forbid students now want to have the best education we are offered without having years of debt trailing behind them. We should just settle for what we can afford, just like previous generations had to. Obviously WE caused the rising price tag of tuition. (These last three sentences are dripping with sarcasm.)
And also, who are you to judge the qualification of a student? An acceptance to USC should be qualification enough, otherwise USC is just enticing students with what they can’t have. I just want to be able to focus on my education without worrying about debt that will never go away, even if I die or declare bankruptcy. That is a heavy burden for anyone, and is the last thing that should be on my mind as I’m deciding and continuing my academic career. 
Don’t be angry.  I’m not making judgments on people individually, but I am most certainly observing a trend that I think is ultimately not helpful to young people as they face challenges ahead in life.  It’s important to work within one’s budget in all areas, including choosing a school.  (By the way, I’m 43 and still young enough to relate on many levels to college students today.)  In the end, we are TROJANS.  I love USC today as much as I did in my time there, and the fact that you or anyone else would choose USC over other choices, despite the financial hurdles, is admirable..  You could get an excellent education across town at UCLA (gross as that is to consider) for a lot less money.  You should be proud of your accomplishments academically and otherwise because it is certainly more difficult to get into USC now than when I was there.  Don’t take any of this as an attack.
I don’t mind you stating your opinion, but I will gladly attack it with fact. People in their thirties admit they can hardly relate to present day collegiate circumstances, and unless you work directly with college admissions and financial institutions it’s likely you’re very removed from the process. I’m from out of state, and a UC school is not just a hurdle but Mount Everest financially. No schools around me offer the education and opportunity that USC does, and it is offensive that you would tell me to go elsewhere. USC obviously wants diversity, especially socio-economically, ergo they should make it feasible for the students they want. It’s as simple as that.
Thanks Mitt Romney. Your argument sounds a lot like “shop around.” There is no entitlement to her arguments. Period. And I second just about everything tojaneer posted below.
Of course you do.  You worked hard through high school and excelled academically, and were accepted to USC… and now you feel you shouldn’t have to pay as much (if at all) for your first choice school.  GROW UP.  And yes, shop around!  Figure it out.  Find the best academic value at the school that gives you the best financial aid package that works within your budget constraints.  The original article was juvenile and uninspired; Your response is predictable.
Of course the article is juvenile, it’s addressing the concerns of people younger than you. That’s the definition of juvenile. The article is “uninspired” because no one in your generation cares enough to address the issue. So we keep having to address it. You want to talk about predictable responses, talk about any adult who talks about how they “pulled themselves up by the bootstraps and figured it out” when the choices then were not only more limited but less than half of the cost they are now. The good old days when a college education was a luxury instead of the necessity and business transaction it is now.
Important to know that in real terms USC’s endowment is significantly smaller than any and all of the schools you mention. Per student endowment is the defining metric (and you mention it). So, in real terms, Dartmouth’s endowment is 4-5 times bigger than USC’s. Important to note that for every 10 applicants accepted to USC, only 3.4 choose to enroll, yet we still enroll ~ 3,000 freshman/year, 65% of which require some sort of financial aid. Yale enrolls less than half this number and per student endowment is ~20 times bigger than ours. So, not only are we enrolling many more needy students but we simply don’t have the endowment to support the generosity of truly elite schools.
The author calls for a better reallocation of funds and more fundraising (because we do it very effectively) in order to fulfill the 100%-of-need-met financial aid USC advertises on all of it’s financial aid information. Because at this point, it is false advertising, and either USC needs to update its websites with the truth or live up to the lies they’re feeding us. (For example, I personally know five students whose EFC is 00000 on FAFSA and they still have to pay out of pocket costs.)
Those schools you mentioned have more solid reputations. SC still has its work cut out. The six billion dollar campaign is for what? Fancier facilities?…

There are over 1,200 USC students living with disabilities. A disability is defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities — including seeing, hearing, sleeping and more. Considering the difficulties that are an inherent part of life for a student with a disability, one might think that schools like USC would do everything that they can to make the lives of these students easier. But, all too often, that is not the case.
Despite the services for support and accommodations offered by USC’s office of Disability Services and Programs, students with disabilities at USC are often left without the proper support, accommodations and overall college experience that they want and deserve, mostly due to a minimalist attitude taken by administrators towards disability accommodations.
The ADA only suggests that “reasonable accommodations” be made for students with disabilities, and, to minimize costs and administrative hassle, schools will often provide students with disabilities only the minimum accommodation that they are legally required to provide, regardless of the effects that this may have on students’ lives. So, for example, students using wheelchairs may be technically able to attend class and live on campus by only frequenting wheelchair-accessible buildings; but, because there are so many buildings that are not wheelchair-accessible, the social and academic lives of those students are still limited. And, it is the limitations — academic, social and otherwise — on the basis of disability for students that are often the result of a university’s minimalist approach to disability accommodations.
What’s worse, oftentimes those limitations can affect a student’s entire college career, from admission right up until graduation.
The Journal of Postsecondary Education and Disability estimates that two-thirds of undergraduate students with disabilities are unable to complete their degree after six years, partially because of the hardships they face when looking for accommodations from universities. Students at USC have recently attempted to combat some of those difficulties by proposing that administrators increase accommodations for students with disabilities, partially by increasing the physical accessibility of certain spaces and providing additional supportive resources for students. Although this proposal has been received by President C. L. Max Nikias with broad support from USG, no university representative has made any commitment to revising current policies to increase the quality of life for students with disabilities at this time.
Proposals like this are a step in the right direction — but, of course, they can only bring about real change if they are acted upon. As a proud Trojan who bleeds cardinal and gold, I would like to believe that USC will someday lead the nation in providing accommodations for students with disabilities, and begin to temper the ridiculously steep uphill battle that students face just to receive their college diplomas. But, I fully believe that this will not happen until students of all abilities join together to pressure administrators to take more than a minimalist approach to bettering the lives of students with disabilities.

I agree with David Carr. Specific examples are needed, and also,take into account many people who have IVs for things  like Crohns disease, Lyme disease, cystic fibrous or even cancer, do get accommodations.
This article is extremely light on specifics.  Where can we read this proposal?  I’m interested to learn in which areas USC is lacking.

Last week, Al-Shabaab, the Somali Islamic militant group, carried out an attack on Garissa University College in Kenya, killing 147 students. It seems too commonplace in today’s global narrative that we hear news of a massacre or killing by an extremist group. The volume of attacks, however, doesn’t mitigate the impact they have on a community. This attack on students in their dormitories is the largest killing by Al-Shabaab in their history. Their attacks have increased in both scope and scale, and they will only continue to wield violence. Al-Shabaab’s disregard for human life to further their barbaric and senseless acts is a cause for global concern. This regrettable attack needs to serve as an impetus for action before further attacks are carried out.
For years, Al-Shabaab has been causing political instability in Kenya and Somalia. Hundreds of Kenyans have lost their lives at the hands of the terrorist group. Similar to ISIS in the Middle East and Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabaab continues to cause instability and chaos in order to advance their own out-of-touch and insensible ideology. When Al-Shabaab initially requested to join al-Qaeda in 2009, Osama bin-Laden had apprehensions about the organization stemming from the group’s penchant to kill indiscriminately and without deliberation. Bin-Laden, the former leader of the world’s most feared terrorist organizations, thought Al-Shabaab went too far in terms of terror. When the mastermind behind numerous deadly attacks around the world, including the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, keeps another terrorist organization at bay because of its savage history, it is a reminder that Al-Shabab needs to be eliminated.
In 2013, Al-Shabaab carried out an attack on one of Kenya’s most cherished buildings, an upscale mall that stood as a symbol of Kenya’s modern advancements and economic development. At least 67 people died, and the image of Kenya as one of Africa’s most stable and secure countries took a hit. With this latest attack, Al-Shabaab continues to damage the goodwill and welfare of Kenya and erase the progress the West African country has made.
What makes the university attack even more tragic is the fact that the militants separated Muslims and Christians, killing the Christians. Those Christians who said they were Muslim to spare themselves were asked to recite a Muslim prayer, and when they failed to do so, they were shot in cold blood. The idea that students were discriminated against on religious grounds, and that faith alone served as the indicator of life or death is a striking reflection of the intolerance the group holds. It is also a philosophy to which terrorists around the world subscribe.
Some at the university were Muslim. Some were Christian. They all, however, were students — students who wished for an education and whose lives were cut short because of barbarism and fanatic ideologies. Like the valiance demonstrated by the schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram, the students at Garissa University College displayed more heroism than any of the militants that callously carried out the detestable attack. With Al-Shabaab meaning “The Youth” in Arabic, the irony is not lost in the group staging a mass murder at a university full of innocent, young students.
The international community must be on guard with Al-Shabaab. Kenyans are so worried about the instability caused by the group that a massive wall is being considered to block the border between Kenya and Somalia. The specter of terrorism and the threat of extremism is spreading throughout the Middle East and Africa. The United Nations and other international coalitions should help bolster the autonomous governments of countries that experience too often the devastating effects of terrorism. The network of terrorist organizations is diverse, and as a result, it will take a complex and long counterterror campaign to extinguish the threats posed.
On the world stage, terrorism has no welcome pass.

Good article. Boko haram, al-shabaab, IS, al kaeda, etc. – they’re nothing but Satanic death cults.
Islam is dark just like black hole. It absorbs and kills everything, nothing escapes it and of course no light (knowledge) comes out of it.
Zoomalis are some of the worst arselifters around too.
Know islam, no peace.
No islam, know peace.

Though, unfortunately, there isn’t a Trader Joe’s within walking distance from campus (2017, come sooner please), sometimes it’s nice to grab an Uber or your friend’s car to make a trip to a grocery store other than Fresh & Easy and Ralph’s. I personally only shop at Trader Joe’s and am consistently satisfied with ever purchase I make there. Here are some of my favorite items, which I highly recommend you try out on your next Trader Joe’s run.
1. Cookie Butter/Cookie Butter Ice Cream/Cookie Butter Cookies
There’s a reason why Yogurtland has a cookie butter flavor: it’s heaven in your mouth. Cookie butter is the only way I can enjoy eating apples and bread, and the tub of ice cream satisfies all sorts of late night cravings. I have yet to try the cookies but based on the popularity of the other cookie butter items, I expect only greatness. I bow down to you, Speculoos.

2. Chicken/Pork Gyoza
These potstickers make for an easy and quick lunch when you’re in a rush. You just stick them in the microwave for two minutes, and voila you have your lunch! The potstickers go nicely with Trader Joe’s Gyoza Dipping Sauce.

3. Crispy Crunch Chocolate Chip Cookies
Not going to lie, these are dangerous to have. But they’re so good . They’re bite-sized and at about 150 calories per every 12 cookies, they make a satisfying treat.

4. Sweet Potato Tortilla Chips
These corn and sweet potato chips are a great snack with a side of guacamole. They’re a perfect blend of sweet and salty and knock regular tortilla chips out of the park.

5. Chicken Tikka Masala
I don’t think it’s possible to ever go wrong in the frozen section of Trader Joe’s. My personal favorite is the tikka masala. It seems small, but it keeps you full all night and definitely rivals Manas.

6. Cauliflower Romanesco Basilic
I did not like cauliflower (or vegetables in general) until I tried these. Easy to make and a perfect complement to protein like chicken or fish, this makes a great addition to dinner. I seriously think the garlic butter makes all the difference.

As one of the closest non-­USC affiliated cafés near campus, Nature’s Brew is a convenient, and hip study spot among students. Located on South Union Ave, the café is about a 15 to 20-minute walk from campus and offers customers a humble abode to study or chat while snacking.
The café’s lunch and dinner menu consists of freshly prepared salads, sandwiches, sides and en papillote. Customers will pick their own protein, starch and seasonings to roast together in a parchment bag. Nature’s Brew’s behind-counter walls are also covered with large boards that list drink items ranging from tangy smoothies to Vietnamese-inspired coffee.

Over several visits, a friend and I have sampled several menu items on our Thursday study nights. I can’t say the sandwiches are my favorite. For $7.99, I got the Beef Brisket sandwich but it left me wondering whether I just wasn’t a brisket person or if the sandwich just was not up to par with my tastebuds. The sandwich, tender meat and cilantro squished in between a crispy baguette, was decent sized, but would have gone well with a side of fries or a bag of chips. I really enjoy the bread, but was not a fan of the mixture of flavors that sat in between both slices of the baguette. I found the pickled red onion to be a bit overpowering and the cilantro a bit too spicy. The tender meat clashed with the over ingredients and made the sandwich appear heavier than it should have been.

The salads are a better hit, but come in at a higher price. My friend ordered the Nicoise salad which came in at $8.99. Salad prices range from $7.99 to $11.50, but that price can easily jump with the addition of extras like chicken or avocado. Though they can be a bit costly, the salads are served in large metal bowls that should fill up a hungry stomach.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
The Nicoise salad was mixed with fresh vegetables in a white garlic dressing with an albacore tuna salad situated on top.
I ordered a smaller portion of a salad, the Chicken Waldorf Salad, for $3.25 off of the sides menu. Though the portion was small, I enjoyed the variety of flavors presented in the small dish. A bed of greens was covered with a creamy chicken mixture that was well complimented with the addition of apples, grapes and walnuts.

If you’re struggling to decide what to order, start out with a drink. Nature’s Brew’s hot menu offers basic coffee beverages along with specialties like flavored mochas and lattes. The cold menu can be a bit pricey, but this is due to the quality of ingredients; the cafe blends together fresh fruits and gives customers a nutritious and flavorful smoothie or juice.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
The Vanilla Sky ($4.50) is a blend of strawberry, pineapple and vanilla. For me, the smoothie was a bit thinner and sweeter than I would have preferred. It was almost like a bubblegum flavor that emerged after a few sips. I also tried the Tropic Pinch ($4.50), which had a strong, distinct flavor to it. The smoothie, which consisted of mango, pineapple, watermelon, agave and ginger, was definitely sweeter than most smoothies I have had before, with the ginger a bit overpowering.
When it came to the coffee based beverages, I tried two of my go­-to’s at popular coffee chains: a vanilla latte and a salted caramel latte. Both were up to par, but I really enjoyed the vanilla latte over my other favorite. The latte was not overly sweet, and the foamy texture was incredibly smooth and pleasant to taste. The salted caramel latte was a bit lacking. “A” for presentation, but the salty/sweet aspect was slightly lacking.

Overall, when it comes to food at Nature’s Brew, customers might find themselves spending just a bit too much for meals that are not completely satisfying flavorfully. I would recommend sticking to the beverages and pastries displayed in the front window for more affordable options.
Though I have noted some flaws at this cafe, I still truly enjoy regularly visiting Nature’s Brew for its welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff. The cafe is spacious enough to fit in around 10 tables with additional couch seating. The atmosphere is quite rustic with wooden paneling along the walls, white wooden chairs illuminated by overhanging mason jar lights, various art pieces on display along the walls for daydreamers and beverages being served to tables in mason jars.
Natalie Laczewski | Daily Trojan
Even if the food has not been completely desirable or affordable so far, I still plan on trying other items on the menu and will continue to count on Nature’s Brew as one of my regular and favorite study spots.
