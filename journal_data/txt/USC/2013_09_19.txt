First half goals from Jordan Marada and Jamie Fink complemented a dominant defensive effort at McAlister Field on Thursday afternoon, where the USC women’s soccer team defeated the Florida Atlantic Owls 2-0 to record its first shutout of the season.

The Women of Troy (5-2-1) were on the offensive from the opening kick, but struggled to convert opportunities into goals in the game’s first minutes. It appeared that USC would strike first at the 13-minute mark, when Marada found fellow senior Autumn Altamirano streaking down the side of the pitch. Instead, Florida Atlantic goalkeeper Courtney Zwetsch made an athletic save to keep USC off the board.
Two minutes later, however, the Women of Troy would finally cash in. A beautiful, long-distance loft pass from Marada found sophomore Jamie Fink in the box, who deftly redirected the ball into the net.
“[Sophomore forward] Katie [Johnson] and I were both making runs, and she drew the defense off of me a little,” Fink said. “Then Jordan Marada sent in a cross with the perfect curve.”
The Fink and Marada show was not over. With 13 minutes remaining in the first half, an Alex Quincey throw-in was deflected into the middle of the field, where Marada found the ball and delivered it into the side of the net. It was the midfielder’s second goal of the year to go with her four assists.
After halftime, it was a tale of strong defense and missed opportunities for the Women of Troy, who outshot the Owls 14 to 5 in the contest. With two minutes gone in the second half, freshman Kayla Mills found a seam down the middle of the field, but could not push a point blank shot past the FAU keeper. At the 55-minute mark, sophomore midfielder Megan Borman could not convert a penalty kick after Fink was fouled in the box. Later, with 13 minutes to play, Marada barely pushed a free kick wide of the Owls’ net.
Even with these close calls, USC never seemed at risk of a loss because of their dominant backline. Goalkeeper Caroline Stanley, who directed traffic expertly all game long, was only forced into action once. The ball simply never seemed to get that far.
Altimirano appeared to be flying all over the field, stealing possession with ease and setting up the USC offense on numerous occasions. Sophomores Natalie Donaldson and Erin Owen were also forces of nature on defense.
Even though Thursday marked the first shutout of the 2013 campaign for the Women of Troy, the backline has been consistent all season, having allowed more than one goal just once this year.
“Our backline is getting better and better every game,” USC head coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “The best part is, I can put eight or nine players out there [on defense] every game and expect the same results.”
“We are so impressed with our defense,” Marada said. “This shutout was so key, and it puts us in great position for the rest of the season.”
The Women of Troy’s offensive difficulties were not a complete mystery. The squad played without star senior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, who sat out with an injury. Eddy leads the team with five goals and brings invaluable experience and leadership to the table.
Khosroshahin knew playing without his star midfielder would be difficult, but was careful to not place too much importance on one player.
“We weren’t as sharp as we normally are up the middle, that’s for sure,” the seventh-year coach said. “But I can’t say if that’s because of one player.”
Marada applauded her teammate’s unselfishness on the bench.
“Elizabeth still made her presence known,” Marada said. “She brought a lot of positive energy off the bench. She is still a leader off the field and gave out a lot of good advice.”
USC soccer returns to McAlister Field Sunday, where the Women of Troy will host Cal State Fullerton at 3 p.m. The Titans bring a 3-2-2 record to the contest, and boast five players who have scored at least one goal apiece. Last season, the Women of Troy defeated CSUF in a tight 3-2 contest. Sunday’s game will mark the final nonconference game for USC, who will then move into Pac-12 play.

Stories about the USC football team this year have all been centered on the somewhat tumultuous offense. Questions have arisen about which quarterback is best fit to lead the unit, junior wide receiver Marqise Lee’s reduced production level, and whether or not head coach Lane Kiffin will even make it through the year.

What all of that attention to the offensive side of the ball has done is distract outsiders from the domination that USC has had defensively thus far. The Trojans are ranked eighth in total defense, allowing a measly 10 points per game, the best mark for a USC defensive squad three weeks into the season in recent memory.
A key, but little known piece of that dominating defensive play has been junior defensive back Josh Shaw. The versatility he has brought to new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergrast’s squad has been pivotal, and his impact is lost on no one inside the program.
“[Shaw] means a lot,” standout junior linebacker Dion Bailey said about his teammate. “Him having experience at corner last year helped us be confident throwing him out there on an island.”
Shaw’s island has meant that opposing receivers have entered the land of no-catches, and he hopes to keep it that way this week both for himself and this defensive unit against Utah State and every other team going forward.
“We want to be the best defense,” Shaw said. “We don’t want to be second to anyone. We want to be the best defense in the country, so we come out here and play [that way] every single day.”
The Palmdale, Calif. native is entering his second season for the Trojans after transferring from the University of Florida because of health problems within his family.
Shaw was recognized as an elite talent coming out of high school — he was ranked as the No. 28 player in the nation by Rivals, as well as the No. 3 cornerback and No. 5 player of all high school players in California.
It was also clear from his prep days that he was a unique physical specimen at cornerback. His scouting report on Rivals noted that “the long-armed Shaw has such a muscular upper body it is hard to believe he is a cornerback.”
That size advantage has let Shaw, who towers over most corners at 6-foot-1 and 195 lbs., to move around in the defensive backfield from day one at USC.
Last year, he started the season off as a reserve safety, backing up now-graduated standouts T.J. McDonald and Jawanza Starling, before moving over to cornerback for the last seven games and starting at that position with some success.
This year, with McDonald and Starling gone, he took over the free safety role in camp and started there for the season opener against Hawai’i, performing well and even returning an interception for a touchdown.
It seemed like he would settle in that role as a stalwart at safety, but he wasn’t done moving. Cornerbacks Anthony Brown and Kevin Seymour went down with injuries early, moving Shaw once again, this time to corner just in time for the Washington State game.
He had two solo tackles against the Cougars and then four more against Boston College, both high numbers for a corner, and he seems to be handling the change smoothly.
“It’s been great,” Shaw said of his sudden switch to corner. “I’ve been adjusting well, playing with a lot of confidence out there, preparing myself well in the film room so when I get out there it’s a lot easier.”
Kiffin has been so impressed with Shaw that he declared him the leader of the secondary before the matchup against the Eagles.
“Seeing how he had approached this offseason and the new defense, [Shaw] is really the leader in the back end back there,” Kiffin said.
When Pendergrast arrived on campus last spring to take over the defense, he brought with him an extremely impressive Pac-12 pedigree, having earned the moniker “Oregon killer” from his days at Cal.
He quickly instituted a unique 5-2 defense. The front seven, headlined by sophomore linemen Leonard Williams and returning senior linebacker Devon Kennard, was expected to be forceful, but questions remained about the secondary, which would be made up of an almost brand-new unit.
Immediately, pressure was put on Shaw, the only returning starter of the unit, to act as a field general in the secondary, and he has absolutely lived up to that billing, even while switching positions on an almost biweekly basis.
“I give credit to Coach Pendergrast,” Shaw added. “He came in from day one told us what to do and how things are going to be … We preach getting the ball, we got to get that ball.”
So far, Shaw has “gotten the ball” once and returned it for a score, but his impact on the defense has been much more than that.
If USC’s defensive unit is to continue its dominance this week against the Aggies, who rank eighth nationally in yards per game, Shaw will surely be in the middle of it all.

Daily Trojan sports editor Will Laws interviewed Curtis Lundstrom, sports editor of the Utah Statesman at Utah State, earlier this week to give USC fans a better feel for the Aggies ahead of Saturday’s nonconference showdown at the Coliseum.
 
DT: Senior quarterback Chuckie Keeton has put up monster numbers for the Aggies so far — is he a legit Heisman contender or are these numbers the cause of a relatively weak schedule so far?
US: If you take a look at Keeton’s career, he’s put up great numbers from the beginning. The numbers this season aren’t just a result of blowouts. Of 12 quarters this season, Keeton has sat for three of them — the fourth quarter against Air Force and the entire second half against Weber State.
Keeton is definitely a legitimate Heisman contender, provided he continues to excel. Saturday’s game against the Trojans is arguably his biggest opportunity to make his case.
 
DT: Is the Aggies’ defense up to the task of defending Marqise Lee and Nelson Agholor?
US: USC’s receiving corps may prove to be the X-factor in the game. The Aggie secondary is well aware of what Lee is capable of, and has struggled this season with penalties in pass defense.
Despite the struggles, USU’s defense as a whole has great pride. They have a tendency to perform best on big stages, and with recent memories of giving up leads late in games, they will have their feet to the pedal for 60 minutes.
 
DT: What is the mood like on campus in Salt Lake City about the team after reeling off two straight blowouts after the disappointing season-opening loss to Utah?
US: Having been around the Aggies for my entire life, I can say with conviction that the aspirations and expectations of Aggie faithful have never been higher for the Utah State football team.
Fans are more confident than I’ve ever seen. Everyone is itching for a program-defining win on the national level to show the Aggies have turned the corner, and Saturday’s game provides that opportunity.
As head coach Matt Wells has said, USU has knocked on that door the past four seasons against Auburn, Texas A&M, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.
Aggie Nation fully expects to go into the Coliseum Saturday and kick down the door and leave with a win.
 
DT: What’s your prediction for this weekend?
US: With no disrespect to a historic program like USC, Keeton and the Aggies are hungry, and even more importantly, they’re more talented than last year’s team that was two missed field goals away from an undefeated regular season.
Anything less than a win will be a disappointment in the eyes of players and coaches.
Utah State pulls off the upset 34-27.

The USC men’s water polo team will go back to work this weekend at the NorCal Tournament, looking to extend its win streak past the current mark of 39.
Unstoppable · The Trojans have been ranked No. 1 since Nov. 2011 and are five games away from tying the program record for consecutive wins. – Daily Trojan file photo
The Trojans have won the NorCal Tournament for three consecutive years, but will face some top competition. In fact, every team participating except the junior college addition, Diablo Valley College, is ranked in the top-20 nationally. The Trojans, for their part, are ranked No. 1 in the nation, a position they have astonishingly held since November of 2011.
Looking ahead, if USC were to win their first two games in tournament play, they would most likely face off against the winner of the Pacific/Stanford game, a matchup USC head coach Jovan Vavic definitely has his eye on.
“Pacific is going to be a tough team, and Stanford this summer played very well,” he said. “Both teams are very good.”
While the field certainly will be competitive, the Trojans seem focused on winning the tournament for a fourth straight year.
“We are getting ready to win it,” Vavic said. “Every year it’s very, very tough, but we’ve won it before.”
Though Vavic and his squad might be focused on continuing their NorCal dominance, one thing they are not focused on is the current winning streak they are riding.
“The thing about the streak is you can’t really worry about it,” Vavic said. “We’re more concerned about making it to the NCAA [tournament] and winning the championship. In the process, if we break some records that’s great, but you’d rather lose a couple early than win a lot and lose the last one.”
If the Trojans win all four games this weekend to claim the NorCal Tournament title, they’d be just one short of the program record, which stands at 44 in a row (2005-06). They’d then be in position to tie and surpass the record against Princeton and Whittier, respectively, on Sept. 28 at home at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
Senior two-meter Jeremy Davie reiterated the point about the team’s focus on capturing a national championship rather than the means of getting there.
“The winning streak for us isn’t what we’re focused on,” he said. “We’re focused on the end goal of winning the championship at the end of the year.”
Some of the fresh faces who have been asked to step into the rotation more this year could be key components after spending last season on the sidelines or in high school.
“I’m pretty pleased with our guys who didn’t play very much last year and the way they have been playing,” Vavic added.
Davie was even more encouraging in discussing some of the newer additions on the team.
“We’ve got new freshman playing well, proving they can play at this level, and we’ve got other guys who are key contributors to this team,” he added.
Regardless of who has been out in the pool, the Trojans have been continuing on their torrid pace from last year, in their effort to win an awe-inspiring sixth straight title this year.
Earlier on in the season, Vavic and his staff experimented a bit with the rotations, especially in goal, and that trend seems to be continuing. This past weekend at the Inland Empire Classic all three goalkeepers, James Clark, Paul Mitre and Aleck Ryner, manned the cage for a whole game, and each performed impressively.
Also noteworthy is senior standout Nikola Vavic, who, in his final go-round as a Trojan, continues to decorate his already immense legacy within the storied water polo program. He currently stands 18 goals away from being the Trojans’ all-time scoring leader, a number he hopes to shrink this weekend in the Bay Area.
The Trojans will begin play on Saturday at 8 a.m. against Diablo Valley College.

It’s easy to hate Lane Kiffin.
Especially when he loses games. After the Washington State debacle two weeks ago, it was hard to imagine a more hated man in college football. After the Trojans put up a single, measly touchdown in a 10-7 loss to the Cougars, “Fire Kiffin” chants echoed off the walls of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Then the following day came the cute “Fire Lane” mock parking signs wrapped around poles on campus. Last week, before the game against Boston College, there were a handful of men wearing “Fire Lane Kiffin” t-shirts.
Luckily for Kiffin, the Trojans dominated the game against Boston College.
Following an 80-yard touchdown by junior wide receiver Marqise Lee in the second quarter, a fan in the fifth row of the student section started waving his arm in the air and chanting,
“We want Kiffin!”
The ecstasy and momentum generated by Lee’s thrilling run just moments earlier dampened with an air of uncertainty, like someone had just cracked an awkward joke. Like the Eagles’ offense that day, the chant never really made it off the ground.
Lane Monte Kiffin might not be a stranger to enmity, but he is best friends with uncertainty. It’s that uncertainty that seems to permeate his tenure that leads so many at USC to make him a scapegoat when things go wrong. It’s not simply the arrogance of a two-point conversion attempt when the team is ahead by double digits, or the fact that he attempts enough fourth-down conversions to make LSU head coach Les Miles blush.
It’s the fact that the same coach who does these things was too skittish to air out the ball against Washington State. People can’t seem to put a finger on Kiffin’s coaching style, and for the most part, many of us haven’t really bothered to try. What might be the youthful tinkering of a man figuring out his strengths and weaknesses looks to the rest of us like an indecisive mess.
What should be beyond the realm of uncertainty, however, is Kiffin’s contributions to USC football during his tenure.
Kiffin willingly took on NCAA sanctions and managed to work within his constraints to keep USC a college football powerhouse.
Kiffin led the Trojans to a 10-2 record in 2011, including a No. 6 finish in the AP poll. The sanctions hadn’t impacted the Trojans on the field immediately, but the scholarship cuts took their toll in the recruiting arena.
But Kiffin did his best with what he had. For the past two seasons, USC has had the No. 8 and No. 13 ranked recruiting classes in the country — despite having 10 fewer scholarships than probation-free schools each year.
Last season alone, Kiffin managed to haul in five Rivals  five-star recruits — out of 12  total scholarships. You might  have  already been acquainted with some of these recruits, including true freshman starting safety Su’a Cravens and freshman Justin Davis, whose leap over an oncoming defender in the Hawai’i game for a touchdown was briefly reminiscent of He Who Must Not Be Named.
Oh, and the Trojans recruited the consensus No. 1 pro-style quarterback in the country in 6-foot-5 freshman Max Browne, who’s redshirting this season. Add these factors together with the fact that the Trojans are only going to become more polished and experienced as the season progresses, and it starts to become clear that Kiffin’s impact will be felt for years — even if he doesn’t make it past the end of the season.
The first play of last week’s game against Boston College played out like an extended metaphor for Kiffin’s rough week following the Washington State game.
Redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler snaps the ball and looks primed to hand it off for yet another Tre Madden run.
Groans from the crowd.
Then, Kessler yanks the ball back prematurely (he really needs to sell these play actions better) and drops back to launch a bomb to a sprinting Marqise Lee. Despite the fact that the pass failed to connect, the student section got up and roared its approval of the play call. For that moment, it seemed all was forgiven.
It was later revealed by Kiffin that the first play of that game was called in by none other than President C. L. Max Nikias, who (aside from managing to singlehandedly scare the hell out of Boston College’s secondary) also offered Kiffin some words of encouragement before the game. And isn’t that the way it should be? Shouldn’t the students of this university, at least, stand behind Kiffin, who stood behind them during sanctions?
Lane Kiffin is a complex man, full of contradictions and uncertainties. Controversy seems to nip at his heels, ‘brash arrogance’ a kind of scarlet letter slapped on his breast by the media. He crossed a blazing bridge from Oakland to Knoxville, only to leave the Tennessee Volunteers’ head coaching position after a year and become a persona non grata in both cities.
Yes, it’s easy to hate Lane Kiffin. But since when do Trojans do the easy thing?

Te coliseum MUST ROCK tomorrow.
The tream needs us to be there for them, the 12th man.
Utah State is going to be a tough game. USC is only favoed by 6 points, so let’s get in the Coliseum and support our team loudly and voraciously.
If you think Utah State is tough, wait until we play ASU in Scottsdale.
We’re starting a 4-5 game sgretch of very tough games.
Time to play like Trojans.
Time for the students and fans to act like Trojans.
Lezz go and Fight On.

Senior outside hitter Sara Shaw led all players with 10 kills to pace a balanced USC offense. Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio chipped in with nine kills, while freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu added eight.
“We’ve got some work to do, but I told them that I was pleased that they won,” USC head coach Mick Haley said. “I thought we did some very good things, but we still aren’t in rhythm yet, and we aren’t recognizing certain situations, so I’m hoping Friday gives us another opportunity to get better.”
Haley opted to incorporate several different rotations into the match, as 13 players saw time against Irvine. Freshman setter Alice Pizzasegola split duties with junior Hayley Crone, notching 14 assists along with five digs and two service aces. Fellow freshmen Anne Marie Schmidt, Taylor Whittingham and Elise Ruddins received minutes throughout the contest, and sophomore middle blocker Kiara Wright performed spot duty as well.
USC maintained a consistent lead throughout the first set, going up 19-10 on back-to-back kills by Nwanebu and Shaw. Junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer knocked down a kill for USC’s 23rd point, after which an attacking error and service error sealed the frame for the Women of Troy.
“We were trying to get a serve-receive pattern straightened out and define responsibilities a little better,” Haley said. “I really think when everyone’s on the same page, this is going to be a great team. I keep wanting to push it a little too fast, but mostly everyone here was satisfied by the win.”
The Women of Troy ran away with the second set, working their way to leads of 16-8 and 24-12 before winning the set on a UCI service error. The third set saw stiffer competition from the Anteaters, but USC held on for the win. Pizzasegola fed Nwanebu for a kill to bring up match point, and a UCI service error again concluded the set and clinched the victory for the Women of Troy.
“I think we kept pressure on UCI, which is good because they’re a very good team,” senior libero Natalie Hagglund said. “They served very tough, and I think our concentration went in and out, but I think our offense was pretty good at times. We need to work on playing a consistent game and keeping our concentration throughout the match.”
Haley has maintained that wins are not entirely representative of where the team stands and said that his squad still has a way to go before realizing its maximum potential.
“I just think we can play so much better,” Haley said. “That’s where I’m at with my evaluation. I’m not so concerned about wins, I just think that we can play better.”
Haley has come to expect the usual consistency from the likes of seniors Hagglund, Shaw and middle blocker Alexis Olgard. But the steady presence of his freshmen after three exhausting road tournaments had Haley beaming.
“The fact that they’re not brain-dead from three weekends in a row on the road is pretty amazing, so I think they’re doing exceptionally well,” Haley said. “The freshmen’s volleyball IQ is very high. They know how to play the game, and that’s what is saving them right now. What I’m asking them to do — changing techniques, learning a new system, meshing with the upperclassmen — is taking a lot out of them, so we’re going to have to get our legs back and be mentally alert.”
USC will host Cal State Fullerton tonight in its final match before kicking off conference play against crosstown rival UCLA next Wednesday.
What has happened to Alicia Ogoms this season? Played very little so far and not at all vs. Irvine. Showed
some good play last year as a freshman expecting her to be even more of a factor for this year. This team
is rotating too much with two setters not a good idea needing to be on same page with sets from one.
Hopefully a more streamlined rotation for the ‘ruins on Wednesday when it really counts.

As USC prepares to play Utah State following a dominant win over Boston College, the attitude around the team has been in stark contrast to its mood after the Washington State loss. Positive energy is obviously a good thing during the days leading up to gameday, but as the Trojans have learned, preparation can never be taken for granted.
“I don’t think we have an overconfidence issue because we don’t have a lot to be confident about,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “I’m not worried about that. What I am worried about is the team we’re getting ready to play. Our players understand that this is a really good team.”
In Utah State, USC will face a team with a dynamic playmaker under center in quarterback Chuckie Keeton, who is generating some quiet Heisman buzz around Logan, Utah, but could significantly boost his case with a win against a high-profile team like USC in a nationally televised game.
“As well as [Keeton] played last year, he’s improved this year with his accuracy and his throwing on time,” Kiffin said. “He doesn’t get sacked very much. He’s a really unique player. To me, he looks a lot like Russell Wilson. He just finds a way to make plays when they’re not there.”
Now in his third season as the Aggies’ starting quarterback, Keeton has been outstanding ever since he arrived on campus. In his first collegiate game, he faced defending national champion Auburn on the road and nearly led Utah State to a shocking upset. He completed 21 of 30 passes for 213 yards, ran for two touchdowns and committed no turnovers in a thrilling 42-38 loss.
The USC defense is ranked No. 4 in the nation in total defense, but it has yet to face an offense as prolific as Utah State’s, which is No. 12 this year and was No. 21 a season ago.
“This is the best offense coming in here that we’ve played [this season],” Kiffin said. “They’re very dynamic. We’re gonna have to tackle extremely well, we’re gonna have to cover well, because they’re really good. There’s a reason they score 50 points a game.”
It will be imperative for the Trojans’ defense to contain the Aggies’ attack from the opening whistle. Last season, Keeton and the rest of the offense regularly started games already in rhythm, something the coaching staff is aware of and has stressed to the players.
“When you look at first quarter scoring statistics from last year, this is a team that really started fast,” Kiffin said. “They had some bad luck later in games, or they would have won those [close] games.”
On defense, the Aggies boast the No. 13-ranked unit in the nation in total defense, though it’s difficult to say they’ve faced the toughest of competition. Against FCS opponent Weber State, Utah State’s defense forced the Wildcats to punt on 12 of its 13 total offensive drives, with the other resulting in a fumble.
“[On defense], if you look at their stats, these guys have dominated people,” Kiffin said. “Even in the games where they have barely lost against bigger name teams, for the most part they outplayed them and have just had some bad breaks.”
One area that Kiffin and the Trojans must improve upon from last week is the penalty department. Against Boston College, USC committed 10 penalties for 100 yards, including multiple personal foul calls on late hits by the defense.
“You can do both: play really physical and play smart,” Kiffin said. “You’re gonna have some [hits] that are on the border when you play aggressive that sometimes get called and sometimes don’t. We’ve got to avoid the ones that are clear.”
Last season, USC was plagued by penalties, ranking No. 7 in the Pac-12 in penalty yards per game. Those types of miscues specifically hindered the team in losses. In a 39-36 loss to Arizona, the Trojans committed 13 penalties for 117 yards, consistently giving the Wildcats additional opportunities to score.
Offensively, USC will try to build upon its impressive performance against Boston College in which the team scored 35 points and had 521 yards of total offense. The most encouraging aspect of the win was the improved play of redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who completed 15 of 17 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns.
USC and Utah State will kickoff at 12:30 p.m. The game will be broadcasted on ABC.

A prescreening and panel discussion of the new PBS documentary Ruben Salazar: Man In The Middle was presented by Visions and Voices last night to a full Annenberg Auditorium, which included Salazar’s two daughters, Lisa and Stephanie.
Looking for answers · Filmmaker Phillip Rodriguez discusses the investigation of Ruben Salazar’s death as experts George Sanchez and Thomas Saenz prepare to speak on Thursday at the Annenberg Auditorium. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The event featured Phillip Rodriguez, director and producer of the film; Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and George J. Sanchez, professor of American studies and ethnicity, and history at USC.
“I thought it was very well made and very well produced,” said Maria Plascencia, a sophomore majoring in American studies and ethnicity. “I like that it didn’t take sides like most documentaries about Ruben Salazar do.”
The documentary chronicles the independent investigation into the life and mysterious death of journalist Ruben Salazar, the first Mexican-American news columnist at the Los Angeles Times and concludes that, despite many conspiracy theories, Salazar’s death was accidental.
“I have stood up here many times representing my father,” Lisa Salazar said after the film. “Now, this documentary allows him to represent himself.”
Salazar was killed on Aug. 29, 1970, by a tear-gas projector fired by a Los Angeles sheriff’s deputy during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War, according to the Los Angeles Times. The march was the culminating point of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, which represented Latinos’ goal of empowerment.
“Today, even in neighboring communities, there are times when people say they’re American, even though they’re from Mexican descent,” said Laura Guzman, a junior majoring in American studies. “I still see a stigma in the younger generations.”
Sometime before his death, LAPD cautioned Salazar about his coverage of the rising Chicano revolutionary movement in the city. Salazar then spoke with members of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and told them he thought he was being followed. Days later, he was killed, and has since become a martyr figure for many Latinos.
“It was a very moving film,” said Will Federman, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. “It gave a great portrait of a complex man.”
Sanchez addressed this issue of Latino assimilation into American culture in terms of many peoples’ idolization of Salazar.
“We had kind of built a mythology about his death,” Sanchez said, “not focusing enough on his life.”
Filmmaker Phillip Rodriguez is a visiting fellow at the Annenberg School whose previous documentaries include Race 2012, Latinos ’08 and Brown Is the New Green: George Lopez and the American Dream. Rodriguez spoke about his quest to bring new light to a story he believes has been previously mischaractarized because of a lack of true information.
“It is a really powerful story about a really extraordinary period in history,” Rodriguez said. “My ambition was to take a story that had been marginalized and put it in the American mainsteam.”
Rodriguez was a young boy living in Los Angeles when Salazar was killed and, as a fellow Latino, wanted to reveal the truth behind the “controversial incident,” which he feels has been “shrouded by conspiracy theories because police were very reluctant to reveal information.”
When police officials refused to release their records, Rodriguez sought help from Thomas A. Saenz of MALDEF, who was another panelist at the screening, and together they took legal action.
“We had to force the police to cough up the details,” Rodriguez said. “And we did so by suing them and winning.”
Though the details of the newly released information offered no new conclusions in the mysterious death the film presents a fuller picture of the life of Salazar and his contributions to journalism.

Wow, really?  Does USC censor comments it doesn’t like?  So much for freedom of speech when it comes to the free press.
I made a comment that the event was great and the film was very well put-together, yet the director Phil Rodriguez was impolite and dismissive of fair questions from the audience…apparently that was too much.
It was good to see a big turnout at this screening. However, the filmmaker, Philly Rodriguez, was pretentious and impolite when people asked him questions. He had the privilege to access classified information, yet he was flippant when more than one audience members asked him questions about this information–a squandered opportunity.
George Sanchez and Thomas Saenz both made very interesting comments and pushed for the classified files to be released–something that definitely needs to happen.

“Our quest for almond milk needs your help!” begins USG’s most recent survey.
The organization is conducting a survey regarding milk choices at both on-campus Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf locations, as well as the on-campus Starbucks, formerly known as Trojan Grounds. The survey began Sept. 10 and will run until Sept. 24.
Support for the idea of offering  almond milk at on-campus coffee shops began within the USG office. Members of USG showed interest in having the extra choice, which initiated a focus group. As a result of the growing initiative, Assistant Director of University Affairs Danielle Norton, a sophomore majoring in business administration with an emphasis in cinematic arts, created the survey to provide USG with more opinions from the greater student body.
“The survey was really to gage opinion and find out what students are really interested in,” USG Senior Director of Communications Olivia Diamond said. “If it turns out that students aren’t interested, then we’re on to the next issue.”
A few hundred students participated in the survey during its first week. Questions on the survey range from students’ milk preferences to if they would be willing to pay an extra fee for almond milk.
Some students fully supported the almond milk initiative.
“I think that’s a great idea,” said Nicole Mata, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention. “Coffee Bean and Starbucks already have the options to substitute milk for soy milk, so they should carry almond milk, too.”
Others did not seem so excited.
“There are five billion choices for how to make your coffee, and they’re just adding to the list,” said Lindsay Gibson, an undecided sophomore. “They already have soy, and that’s what kids drink if they’ve got a problem with milk.”
Health concerns, however, go beyond those who are lactose intolerant. Almond milk, which is made from ground almonds and water, has several health benefits. Because it does not contain lactose, soy or casein, a milk product similar to gluten, almond milk is suitable for students who are allergic to more than just regular milk.
It also does not contain any animal products and is consequently a favorite of vegetarians and vegans.
Even non-allergic omnivores sometimes prefer almond milk because it contains fewer calories than dairy and soy, or simply because they find it tasty.
“It’s just like any other health trend,” Norton said. “Almond milk is popular, especially in the girl world. So when people started talking to me about it, I got really excited.”
Though the results of the survey haven’t yet been tallied, some said they don’t think the demand will be there.
“I have mentioned it to some of the clients here, but when I said it would be possibly a dollar more, they did not like the idea,” said Max Lopez, the manager of the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at the School of Cinematic Arts. “I’m not opposed to trying to bring it in. I haven’t had a lot of requests or specific requests because [people are] happy with the soy option we have.”
At the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, a “regular” cafe vanilla costs $3.75. If Lopez’s estimate that almond milk will cost an extra dollar is correct, the total cost of a 16 ounce drink would be close to $5.
Some students were less concerned with the actual issue of almond milk, than the fact that they believed there were more pressing issues, such as unhealthy food options in general and the abundance of plastic and paper to-go containers.
“By no means are we investing large amounts of resources in this [almond milk],” Director of University Affairs Andrew Menard said. “We got a lot of exciting projects going on this semester. This is just a small little focus group.”
Some other projects that University Affairs is currently pursuing include putting new windows and blinds in university housing, adding printers and weight racks in dormitory buildings and reserving parking on game days for commuter students.
“I think USG likes to conquer the big things, but if we hear something small that maybe we could fix, we’re more than willing to listen,” Norton said.
This is why the rest of the country thinks California is a joke
As a member of “girl world”, I disagree.
What really annoys me & keeps me from buying coffee at SC is that they charge extra for soy milk even if you’re just using it as a creamer. Every Starbucks & Coffee Bean outside of campus offers soymilk with the other creamers.

Popular Science magazine has named USC assistant professor Andrea Armani one of their “Brilliant Ten,” a title reserved for young scientists dramatically impacting their fields of study. Armani works in the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in the Viterbi School of Engineering and leads research that draws from physics, chemistry and biology.
“If the Brilliant Ten are the faces of things to come, the world will be a safer, smarter and brighter place,” read Popular Science’s article.
Armani earned this title through her research and development of new scientific tools. She works with a group of 20 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to conduct her research. One of their projects is to create the components to make an optical computer, a computer that uses photons instead of electrons to keep the system cool, a reality.
Armani will be teaming up with Professor Alan Willner of USC’s Information Sciences Institute to help take the system from individual components to a full computer.
Not all the projects Armani is involved with, however, are computer related. Popular Science also focused on Armani’s development of specialized sensors such as resonant cavity sensors, which Armani believes might be used to detect small traces of disease. These sensors could be potentially used to study how drugs bind to their targets.
Armani has also developed a ultraviolet sensor that can monitor an individual’s sun exposure throughout the day, which could be especially useful to children and those prone to skin cancer. Her sensors could potentially be used to detect radioactivity, biological weapons or waterborne pathogens.
“When I was in ninth grade, my parents told me that I had to choose a focus, and now I tell them, ‘See? I was right; I didn’t have to choose. Why choose when you can do it all?’” Armani told Viterbi.
Armani studied not just one, but three fields of interest: physics, chemistry and biology. Her expansive knowledge in the three fields allows her to conduct research on a wide variety of topics.
“Industrial R&D, if done right, should be very results-focused, aware of the tyranny of time,” Robert Carnes, a former Battelle research director, told Popular Science.  “She can out-industry industry.”

Students and faculty members gathered to talk about recent issues in the Middle East at a panel discussion titled “The Arab Uprisings: Crisis and Conflict in Egypt, Syria and Beyond” on Thursday afternoon at Doheny Memorial Library.
Middle East crisis · Professor Sherman Jackson discussed the Arab riots in Egypt, Libya and Syria on Thursday at Doheny Library. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The event, hosted by the Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences’ Middle East Studies Program, was composed of a panel of five professors: Sarah Gualtieri, an associate professor of history and American studies and ethnicity; Sherman Jackson, a professor of religion and American studies and ethnicity; Laurie Brand, a professor of international relations; Wayne Sandholtz, a professor of international relations and law; and Fayez Hammad, a political science lecturer.
“It is important for students on our campus to know the ways in which our government and our society is involved in these crises, and we were also trying to provide information on issues that might have needed clarification for our students,” Gualtieri said.
Many students believed the panelists successfully addressed several pressing issues in the region.
“I thought it was a good overview of how the situation has developed, the militarization of the conflict in Syria and the challenges of the transition to democracy in Egypt and Libya,” said Natasha Pesaran, a doctoral student in the history of politics.
The panel discussed the recent transition to more militarized and violent protests. According to the group, in 2011, when conflicts in the Middle East began to erupt, the movements were mainly nonviolent and not based on religion, but now that time has passed, the movements have changed drastically. The panelists also said that the media generally tends to show the public more gunfire.
“I think it’s kind of our responsibility as educated citizens to take an interest in the things that are going on in the world and [where] American influence is still pretty strong,” Pesaran said.
Many students were also glad that the professors serving as panelists gave them a context into which they could fit all the recent news they had heard from the area.
“For me, it was actually really interesting to hear professors on campus theorize how to make sense of the past three years,” said Maytha Alhassen, a doctoral student in American studies and ethnicity.
The professors each gave a 10 minute talk about what has been happening in the Middle East, with each professor focusing on a different part of the uprisings before opening up the panel for a question and answer session.
“What was most interesting for me was looking at the different intersections of different fields and trying to understand everything that’s happening in the region, but I really liked that there were some precise focuses on countries and regions,” Alhassen said.
Though the talk was centered on the Middle East in general, the professors tried to focus on the issues in Egypt, Syria and Libya since those tend to be the countries that students hear about the most.
“I liked that Professor Gualtieri was also highlighting creative resistance and the grassroots organizing in the region,” Alhassen said. “That for me is where my passion stands — with the people on the ground, what they’re talking about and how they’re voicing their resistance.”
The media often fails to mention the role of Syrian women in the upheavals, and in the past, these women have marched through the market as “brides of peace” according to Gualtieri.
“I have family everywhere, and I’m very interested in the topic in general. I wanted to see how the university is engaging in this discussion about something that was happening thousands and thousands of miles away,” Alhassen said.
The panelists also emphasized the importance of these issues for Americans.
“The Arab uprisings are very important topics not only for the Arabs themselves but for a wider global audience. It is a very large, significant region in the world that is going through monumental revolutions,” Hammad said.
Through participating in discussions such as these, the professors hope to raise awareness at USC about the problems in the Middle East.
“The fact that students took a note about this presentation and were able to come and listen to this is reassuring that people are actually eager to know about this information,” Hammad said.

There are few movie scenes that are as exciting as cars going really fast. Take your pick from swerving through traffic, making hairpin turns on mountain roads or bearing down onto the finish line. They’ve been a staple in action movies for decades, and they’ve grown their own subgenre of car movies. The formula is straightforward: Include an exciting high-speed car scene and tons of people will love it.
It’s because the car chase is so straightforward and easy a crowd-pleaser. The Fast and The Furious franchise of movies, now filming its seventh installment, is often chided for being such an obvious exploitation of that formula. The plots of the movies are really not much beyond papier-mâché vehicles — pardon the pun — to bring us larger and more complex racing and chasing scenes. Which is not to criticize the movies themselves — Fast Five was one of my favorite flicks of 2011 — but the potential for drama that wild driving can bring has rarely been examined.
One film which will seek to build on the potential for drama in car films is Rush, which will be out in limited release this weekend. The sports drama focuses on the 1976 Formula 1 racing season, but it will also seek to delve into the twisted adrenaline-fueled psychology that’s required for anyone who willfully drives a car going 200 mph. Addressing such complex themes in a sport that’s struggled to gain a foothold in America is a bold move by Exclusive Media studios and super-director Ron Howard, if only because such a film hasn’t been made. That said, a film like Rush really seems overdue.
There have certainly been great car scenes in dramatic movies. The winner of the 1971 Academy Award for Best Picture, The French Connection has one of the most iconic chases of all time, and the game of chicken from Rebel Without a Cause is a major plot point. But these scenes have generally been relegated to action movies (with obvious exceptions including Talladega Nights or Cars). This is in no way a bad thing. The most iconic chase scene of all time is probably the one from Bullitt. That scene, with Steve McQueen oozing cool in an iconic-in-its-own-right green blur of a Mustang on the streets and hills of San Francisco, is the scene against which all chase scenes made after its 1968 release are measured against. That scene is pure cinema, visual storytelling at its finest. To cinema purists who value telling as much as possible visually and just as little verbally, this should be a boon, and it certainly was at the time. The highly innovative camera placements and, more than anything else, editing, was lauded at the time. Frank P. Keller, the editor, won the Oscar for Best Editing that year and the general consensus was that Keller would have won the Oscar even if the film was cut down to only the 10-minute car scene.
It makes sense that the trick is in the editing and cinematography, which allows these films to succeed where anything similar in real life cannot. Sure, racing like that must be absolutely exhilarating, but watching a car race in real life is much more boring. Chases are usually worse; the ones that we usually see on television are slow and careful, usually ending very quickly. O.J. Simpson’s famous chase in that white Bronco was suspenseful, but no one could say it was exciting.
With editing and camera angles, a movie can put you in that car, right in the pulse of the conflict. Of course, one thing that allows for that editing that is not available in real life is the ability to film multiple takes. That ability is accentuated by the budget to destroy several cars in the process of making a scene. The Bullitt chase was shot over a period of five weeks. In Ronin, another film with iconic chase scenes, John Frankenheimer used more than 300 stunt drivers in some scenes (he also would fine the drivers if he could see their brake lights, to encourage more aggressive driving). These inherent advantages allow films to create a unique experience. Short of actually being a professional driver, these scenes are the only place where most people will ever experience the sensation of such speed.
It seems this sensation will also be the source of the drama in Rush. It takes a certain dash of crazy to strap into a half ton monster like that. Even if they aren’t driving into oncoming traffic in a Mini like Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity, Formula 1 drivers are still putting their life on the line every time they climb into their car.
To borrow from Tom Wolfe, you need The Right Stuff to take such risks. Wolfe’s 1979 book on U.S. postwar experimentation with rocket-powered aircraft and the book’s subsequent 1983 film adaptation dealt with the personal aspects of the risk-taking subjects, so Rush can look at the similarly interesting psyche of the racecar driver. In film, it really hasn’t been truly examined in any meaningful way, the wonderful 2010 Ayrton Senna documentary Senna being the outlier. But if Rush is done right, Howard might be able to marry the sheer exhilaration of movie races with the real drama of the drivers.

One of the most spectacular moments of The Wizard of Oz, now at the Pantages Theatre for a three-week run, is the dazzling entrance of Glinda, the Good Witch.
And though the sparkling imagery and big moments transport the audience into a world of fantasy, what makes this production of the classic 1939 movie musical truly magical are the smaller moments, such as Dorothy’s charming footwork as she follows the legendary Yellow Brick Road in her glittering red slippers. The dynamic mix of strong staging with emotionally touching character moments makes this Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jeremy Sams adaptation somehow manage to capture the audience’s imagination and keep its attention, even though we know exactly what will happen next.
Since the film has resonated with audiences throughout many generations, there is always the temptation to compare it with any new stage adaptation. Fortunately, however, this production can stand on its own. Dorothy is played by Danielle Wade, who was cast through a Canadian reality TV show. With a voice that’s reminiscent of Judy Garland, Wade imparts a fragile yet graceful strength to Dorothy that is all her own.
Wade, however, wasn’t the only star of the show. The Scarecrow, played by Jamie McKnight, had impeccable comedic timing. Lee MacDougall’s Lion was on point with hilarious double entendres and Cedric Smith was solid in his role as Professor Marvel/The Wizard.
As excellent as the performances were, The Wizard of Oz’s special effects were just as inspiring. The cyclone, complete with thunder, lightning and everything in between, was marvelously brought to life through skillful projections by video designer Jon Driscoll. Lighting designer Hugh Vanstone also did an outstanding job, especially with the spectacular visuals in Emerald City. Sound designer Mick Potter kept the acoustics crisp so all lyrics were perfectly clear. Music director David Andrews Rogers and orchestrator David Cullen made the music a vivid part of the story, as it was with the original film. Director Jeremy Sams made the characters seem familiar yet new and gave the ensemble a togetherness that was touching. Irene Bohan’s costumes helped set the scene and describe the characters. Her Glinda costume was dazzling; her Professor’s long coat and satin vest were a poignant setup of this picturesque person.
That the original songs hold up so well is a credit to the creative talent of the original composers. “Over the Rainbow” retains its wistful beauty; “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead” has humorous appeal; and “Follow The Yellow Brick Road/We’re Off To See The Wizard” is as catchy and hopeful as ever. The songs of the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, “If I Only Had (a Brain, A Heart, The Nerve),” project each character’s unique message in a fresh way. As far as the add-ons, Lloyd Webber and Rice are at their best with the Wizard’s warning, “Bring Me The Broomstick,” which echoes the spellbinding melodies of the duo’s greatest achievement, Phantom of the Opera.
Though the show succeeds on many levels, there were a few misses. The opening song — an original by Lloyd Webber and Rice — called “Nobody Understands Me,” comes off as ordinary, both musically and lyrically, especially since it is followed by the stellar Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg  1939 classic, “Over The Rainbow.” Some of the special effects were over the top, such as the enormous lights flashing at the audience too many times during the show. The suspense would have been better sustained through a stronger use of music or better acting. For example, though Jacqueline Piro Donovan excelled as Miss Gulch on her bicycle, she could have been a scarier Wicked Witch of the West. Of course, the gold standard is Margaret Hamilton’s portrayal of the Wicked Witch from the 1939 film. Hamilton used her trembling voice, menacing posture and yes, her smile, to reveal herself as the “Queen of Mean.”
When Toto, Dorothy’s dog, played by a rescue animal named Nigel, turns toward Dorothy during her solo of “Over the Rainbow,” that precious moment is the work of animal trainer William Berloni. Spectacular effects make us ooh and ahh, but those more subtle cues make this Wizard of Oz the stuff of fantasy that sticks in our memories.

Senior philosophy, politics and law major Daniel Simonds walked back to his apartment after finishing an astounding 80 miles on the stationary bike at the Lyon Center. When he got back to his place, instead of getting in the shower or taking a nap, he simply changed his clothes, got a quick bite to eat and began the second part of his workout: an 18 mile run to Manhattan Beach. This rigorous day of training took a huge toll on Simonds’ body, but by no means was it his crowning achievement. That is set to come on Sunday, when he will run in his very first Iron Man Triathlon, a competition characterized by some impressive figures: a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride, 26.2 mile run and $3,500 to charity.

Simonds will start his race in the cold waters of Lake Tahoe at 6 a.m., embarking on a full day of brutal exercise which can take contestants up to 17 hours to complete. The 140.6 mile race will be the culmination of months of intense, focused training. But Sunday will be about more than just Simonds’ personal accomplishments. It will mark a victory for a handful of cancer patients in Manhattan Beach, hundreds of miles away from the race.
The John Wayne Cancer Foundation is a small non-profit health organization that provides support to cancer patients through active programs such as sports and summer camps, while also devoting resources for research.
“It’s small and personal,” Simonds said, who noted the relationships formed as one of the key components for why he became attached to the organization. “Being active has done so much for me, and that’s what I want to give to these people who haven’t been as lucky as I have.”
After visiting and getting to know more about the foundation, Simonds knew that he had found a worthwhile cause. Fundraising became a part of the daily regiment, just as much as the physical training. He first approached Chris McCall, a fellow Kappa Sigma brother and the fraternity’s president at USC about his triathlon plans.
“He was so supportive of me,” Simonds said.
According to Simonds, Kappa Sigma’s $300 donation kick-started his fundraising drive. From there, Simonds used a variety of tactics, including handwritten letters, emails and personal conversations to raise money. Going into the race on Sunday, Simonds has $3,500 pledged in his name to the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.
Simonds hails from Santa Rosa, Calif. where he was involved in sports in middle and high school. Throughout his childhood, he had taken a liking to baseball and soccer. It was at the beginning of high school, however, that he fully dedicated himself to tennis.
“I was playing about seven times a week,” Simonds said.
Before his senior year he was even debating taking his passion for tennis to the collegiate level, and he had been in contact with the tennis coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo before a shoulder injury prior to his senior season left him unable to compete.
During his sophomore year at USC, however, Simonds wanted to try something new.
“I decided on a whim to run a marathon,” Simonds said.
After signing up for the San Diego Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon, Simonds began a training program that he admits was less than adequate.
“I felt terrible during the race,” Simonds said. “It was clear I didn’t prepare the way I should have.”
Despite the state of his body during the race, there was something Simonds found appealing about the marathon.
“It’s that hard work and the fact that you pushed yourself that I like,” Simonds said. “I like to see how far I can push myself.”
When Simonds committed to participate in this year’s Iron Man, it was clear that he had a lot to do before the start of the race. From then on, he trained 12 times a week in a manner that he describes as “periodized.” Simonds would usually complete two workouts a day, practicing two of the three disciplines, then alternating throughout the week. The weekends were usually reserved for the longer, more strenuous runs and bike rides where he really pushed his endurance.
The training process tested his body, but also his discipline.
“Training at school meant that I had to say ‘no’ a lot,” Simonds said. “You have to believe that each one of these times you sacrifice hanging out with someone or going to the 9-0 is worth it. You have to believe that.”
In the final days before the starting gun sounds, Simonds is giving 100 percent of his attention to the coming race. He will spend his time sleeping, stretching, walking through key parts of the course and eating.
“It’s nothing too fancy, just stay safe, stretch. It’s not the time to try Indian food for the first time,” Simonds said.
Mentally and physically, Simonds admits that he is only ready to an extent. In the lead up to the race, he read the book Going Long, which is essentially a how-to for the Iron Man competition. The book explains that no training can replicate the feeling of an Iron Man. There is no point, Simonds explains, in planning his time or setting goals for his first race. He just wants to finish.
“It’s an ominous feeling when you don’t know how it’s going to take a toll on your body,” Simonds said.
Sunday may be Simonds’ last opportunity to do an Iron Man. Next year he plans to graduate, attend law school and follow in the footsteps of his mother, Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Dana B. Simonds.
For the time being, however, Simonds is not thinking about anything past 6 a.m. Sunday morning. Though the outcome of the race is not certain, one thing is: the $3,500 going to the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.
“I’m just happy I could do something positive,” Simonds said. “I’m happy I can give back.”
You make the entire Simonds clan proud. Best of luck to you!
What a tremendous achievement!  I am so impressed that Daniel found an unselfish reason to use his strength and perseverance .  I hope many people will take the cue and make donations to the  John Wayne Cancer Foundation  or the charities of their choice. Daniel and his family should be so proud.  I am proud, too…not because I’m his grandmother!
Wow!
What amazing dedication!
Daniel, you earned a visit to the 9-0!!!
(Dunno what that is, but sounds like fun.)

In response to “Petraeus unfit to mentor USC students”
As veterans pursuing MBAs at the USC Marshall School of Business, we are troubled by Jayel Aheram’s article, “Petraeus unfit to mentor USC students,” in the Daily Trojan. First of all, it should be made clear that Mr. Aheram does not speak for the entire USC veteran community. Second, his opinion piece betrays a lack of comprehension of several things. Among these are the relationship between number of troops and impact of enemy behavior in a theater of war to the number of casualties and the dynamically evolving conditions in an increasingly destabilized Afghanistan during the period in question. More troubling, however, is the near total ignorance his piece demonstrates of the nature and burden of leadership.
Those of us who served long enough to hold command responsibility know the extent of leaders’ efforts to ensure that the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines whose lives are our responsibilities are as prepared as possible, and that the risks they will face are mitigated to the greatest extent possible. We know what it is like to do everything in our power to protect them, and we also know only too well the overwhelming personal anguish felt when those efforts are not enough to bring all of them home alive and well. We can only begin to empathize when that responsibility, those efforts and that anguish are on the scale borne by leaders such as Gen. Petraeus.
Perhaps Mr. Aheram’s antipathy toward Gen. Petraeus percolated from the painful things many veterans of our generation have witnessed in combat. Perhaps it was inspired by any one of the several antiwar and protest organizations for which he is an activist. Either way, he is entitled both to his opinion and to express it, and we vigorously defend his right to do so. Given the disrespectful manner in which he chooses to do so, however, we strongly object to his failure to make abundantly clear that he does not speak for many, if not most, USC veterans.
America’s veterans, like the society we served, are a diverse bunch, and are not universal Petraeus defenders. Some of us are less than impressed with his decision-making, whether personal or professional. The vast majority of us, however, harbor an immense amount of respect for the fact that he is a man who has devoted nearly 40 years of his life to the service of our nation, and for the sacrifices his family has made to support him. Mr. Aheram’s piece was a slight against that service, and we lament that he did not bother to clarify that he speaks for himself, and not other veterans.
The University of Southern California has nearly a century-long heritage of supporting our nation’s veterans and armed forces. We could not be more grateful for the welcome we have received from USC, and the lengths to which this university has gone to ease our transition back to the civilian world. We thank USC for its efforts to prepare us to thrive in the private sector, including its efforts to provide senior-level mentorship for that transition. We look forward to working with Gen. Petraeus and with our fellow veterans, including Mr. Aheram, to ensure that USC’s veterans continue to contribute positively to our Trojan community and to our nation.

One of the fastest growing iOS apps today, Vine allows users to become self-made cinematographers through vignette-style videos, six seconds at a time. Videos include everything from cartoon animations to shots of lovable animals. Though Vine is undoubtedly a creative outlet for budding artists, there have been a disturbing amount of videos depicting women as vapid, vain and slutty.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Many Vines star men dressed up as women, presumably for comedic purposes. But these videos only further negative stereotypes of female habits.
“This party is so lame,” quips a male Vine user in a falsetto voice. After a few moments, his friends squeal in unison, “Mirror pic!” and squeeze together in front of a small bathroom mirror with chests and buttocks sticking out, arms at waists and pouty lips frozen in duckface.
Though meant to be silly, these Vines unnecessarily satirize women’s daily activities.
Several of these Vines also portray women as clingy. One video presents a woman holding her boyfriend at gunpoint while he “Likes” all of her Instagram photos in succession; a similar one features a girl asking her boyfriend which other girls he finds attractive, but his sentence is cut short by her pointing a gun at his head.
One video entitled “You hang up first” features a girl on her phone in her car, lovingly telling her boyfriend that he should hang up first. But when he actually does, she goes into a fit of rage and speeds down the road.
The clingy female stereotype seems to be a current craze, but characterizing women as though they are of unsound mind is no new idea. Historically, men have portrayed women as highly prone to insanity. Hysteria in women was a diagnosable disease until the early 20th century. These were all tactics to dumb females down. In retrospect, these beliefs are shockingly obsolete. But in this age of technology, why are we reverting to old ideologies?
In addition, there were also videos that trivialized sexual harassment of women. One Vine depicts a girl being approached and grabbed by two boys, and upon her escape, the spurned boys dance to Young Dro’s “F-ck Dat B-tch.” Albeit staged, the video echoes one of the main aspects of rape culture: that a woman should be grateful for lewd remarks and flirtation attempts, otherwise she is a “b-tch.”
Another video, entitled “How to pick up girls,” shows a boy running down a sidewalk towards a girl. He then grabs her from behind and lifts her up, carrying her away as she screams. Staged or not, the video pokes fun at the harsh reality of street harassment that so many women endure.
With each “Like” and “Revine” of these insensitive videos, women are further and further objectified. When young people are finally taught to recognize misogyny in even the little things, such as Vine videos, the Internet will become a much more hospitable place for women, and Vine can once again be used as a creative outlet rather than a sexist one.

I’d have sided with you entirely if you hadn’t attempted to paint the whole thing that way with the headline. Because I agree, this is unacceptable. But a platform isn’t to blame, it’s people’s misogynistic upbringings.
I wonder how many people saw the Venus symbol in the cartoon and immediately scrolled down to write a mindless comment…
This is an outright ridiculous article. Feminists like you are making women look worse, not the videos that you shouldn’t be taking seriously in the first place. It’s amusing to poke fun at stereotypes, and women are no exceptions. You ma’am, are a spoiled brat who needs to get a sense of humor.
A little bit of common sense would say “Some vine users are reinforcing misogynistic attitudes”. A normal amount of common sense would say “A certain type of female’s behavior is being parodied, but that’s ok, because everyone gets made fun of on the internet, and as someone who is all for equality, I’m ok with this, because it’s not as if I want to be on a pedestal or anything like that.”
So what about the Vines in which women depict themselves as “vapid, vain, and slutty?”
I wonder when people like this author will understand what hyperbole is and realize that that’s all people take it for.
Feminists don’t have that kind of common sense. They see dumb stuff like this as evidence of some sort of over-arching conspiracy to subjugate women.
At least the writer reminds us about the University of Spoiled Children!
Stereotypes exist for a reason: There are elements of truth to them.  If the shoe fits…
Build a bridge and get over it.
Dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.
The Daily Trojan really needs to start adding a feature that reads someone’s comment back to them before they post it to curb the amount of ignorance and stupidity we all have to experience.
Why don’t women wear watches? cause theres a clock on tha stove. – charles barkley
you have a brain a 1/3 the size of ours. its science.
1/3, as in 60% smaller?  Try 8%.  I think you need to go back to school, Mr. “science”.
I’m regularly shocked by how many men and women condone portraying rape, assault, and harassment as acceptable. Thank you for bringing attention to this. It’s so infuriating that even in these comments people can’t intelligently debate but instead resort to the ever-so-creative “it must be her period.”
Of course only a girl would write just a stupid article hahahaha, pathetic
Cripes a mighty! People will complain about and accuse ANYTHING of victimizing them these days. I am so sick of the entitled attitude and perpetual claims of victim-hood of people like you! Offended by any little thing and ready to scream I AM BEING OPPRESSED by anything that you take even the SLIGHTEST offense to, it is a characteristic of an excessively thin skin and insecure self-esteem to write pointless tripe like this. This millennial generation is full of entitled whiners who have no idea what it means to be oppressed, discriminated against or hurt. Here’s a reality check for you: the world is not obligated to tiptoe around your precious feelings, then change its ways to suit your delicate sensibilities! Real life will hurt more than your petty feelings! It can tear you apart and even kill you!
I wish you grew up in my time, as a black person, like I did so you could learn what REAL oppression is, what REAL victimization is, and see that you have it so good today and have NO RIGHT to complain about things like this. Your entire article is petty! Grow some backbone and get over yourself!
I was born to a black, baby boomer parent and I’ll tell you right now I couldn’t agree with you more.  Just please know that not all of us millennials are this whiny and entitled.  I feel the same way as you, even though I could only imagine the horror of what my ancestors experienced.  I honestly hang out mostly with Gen Xers because I can’t stand so many in my age bracket.  I also hate radical feminism with a passion.
Increase your dosage of Midol.
Pull ur tampon out.
what would pulling a tampon out do?
Video editing apps hate women.  Another insidious conspiracy of the patriarchy nobody even thought to consider, I guess.
The author should feel free not to feel like a victim. I am so tired of everyone today coming out like a wounded victim of some made up injustice. If you are not a vacuous female – then these vids should not be belittling you. How many guys have been insulted by the Carl’s Jr ads where they claims without their restaurants, most guys would starve – followed by some male dolt trying to make a meal for himself. How many  guys are wounded and hurt and insulted by this ad which is stereotyping men as buffoons who could not feed themselves – that is if the insulted men were thin-skinned serial victims looking for the next person to cause them harm.
BTW – have you noticed most stereotypes are deemed most insensitive – especially when there is a tinge of truth to it? Otherwise, we wouldn’t be getting our panties in a bunch pretending we do not understand where the origins of the insulting stereotype even comes from.
Are we only now allowed to tell plain vanilla, mediocre jokes and only allowed to make fun of middle aged white guys? Really?
sorry for partying
