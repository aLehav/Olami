Before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, USC student Sasha Reiss and UC Santa Barbara student Josh Andrews heard complaints from a preschool administrator about the ineffectiveness and ambiguity of the app their school was using for pick-ups and drop-offs. Without a firm understanding of the app’s mechanics and with winter break drawing to an end around January, administrators entered the school year with frustration and confusion.
In response to this, the duo, in tandem with cofounders Daniel Andrews and Max Miranda, both UC Berkeley alumni, developed Carline School Management to facilitate the hectic process.
The app, which launched in early April, makes the sign-in process contactless and easier to carry out, according to the founders and users, which is proving to be beneficial amid the ongoing pandemic.
“At the time, most schools either had pen and paper sign-outs — [a] communal writing utensil touched by tons of parents and teachers every single day — or it’s a school iPad that was passed around,” said Reiss, a senior majoring in art history and business administration. “The sign-in and sign-out process had to radically change in order to adapt to this post-COVID world.”
Carline’s main function is to expedite the sign-in process at preschools; however, the app offers a variety of features for parents in addition to signing students in and out of school: designating authorized guardians, setting up playdates and checking their child’s schedule.
Carline also provides a digital signature option. The state of California requires wet signatures from parents in order to validate the authenticity of sign-in-sign-out sheets at preschools. However, signing with your finger on the app counts as a digital signature which can be used in lieu of a written one. 
The app has since been adapted to include health questionnaires where parents must report any symptom their child may be experiencing, thus allowing schools to monitor students and curb the spread of the virus. 
According to Dr. Tamar Andrews, the director of Temple Isaiah Preschool in Los Angeles, implementing the app has significantly improved parents’ experiences with the process, especially after a considerable number of parents had become disgruntled from using the other educational apps that were previously utilized by the preschool.
“We found that with Carline School Management, the parent experience was so much better than anything else, and for us, our number one priority besides safety is happy customers,” Andrews said. “Parents were wondering why we didn’t use this from the beginning.” 
The team, consisting of 12 members, executed about 100-200 dry runs among themselves as well as with the teachers at Temple Isaiah Preschool in order to ensure the app was functioning as intended. The app continues to be updated to improve user experience. 
“Parents have found it incredibly intuitive, and the other thing that parents love about it is the experience they have when they do have a problem, and they have to call for tech support,” Andrews said. “The people who answer the phone are immediately responsive and appropriate and very helpful and polite.”
The app took three and a half months to develop after the initial design was drawn up according to the requests of administrators and parents, owing to the cofounders’ combined backgrounds in business, design and software development.
Carline was beta-tested with 70 students in December at the Temple Isaiah Preschool’s winter camp before being launched at the preschool. 
Karla Leung, a junior majoring in communication and a product design intern at Carline, said that along with the initial beta test, the app undergoes frequent testing in order to make sure the interface is easy to understand.
The app diverges from other primary education management apps by focusing on one feature: the sign-in-sign-out process. Thus, it assists preschool teachers and alleviates stress during one of the most trying times of their day, Andrews said. 
The simplicity of the software also enables the team to offer the app at an affordable and competitive price.
“Almost every single other solution tries to operate a whole entire package deal, and so you’re locked into their services as well as their infrastructure for your whole entire school, and this generally runs at a much higher premium,” Andrews said. 
With an emphasis on customer service, Carline provides parents with video tutorials on how to operate the app and in-app support, as well as instructions and a live chat option on its website. 
The team said it wants to concentrate on building upon existing relationships and ensuring that its customers feel that their needs have been met.
According to Reiss, the team makes development decisions after heavily researching the schools they work with, talking with clients and defining ways to mitigate specific issues. 
After its initial success at the Temple Isaiah Preschool, the Carline team rose in popularity after being recommended by satisfied preschool directors. The developers also marketed themselves through different social media platforms, targeting preschool administrative discussion forums.
The app is currently being utilized in nine preschools across five states: California, New York, Massachusetts, Georgia and Virginia. There are plans to possibly expand into secondary and higher education institutions.
“In the future, we do see Carline becoming an application bundle that replaces the entire back office of any sort of school … we want it to be a turnkey software system that makes it so easy to operate your school,” Reiss said. “We are basically creating a massive distribution channel that could far outpace the app itself in terms of growth due to the natural network that exists.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the year and majors of Sasha Reiss. It also falsely stated that a fingerprint could be used as a signature in the application. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

When I first decided to write this column, I was overly optimistic that our University, the Pac-12 and the NCAA would create some type of strict protocol so that student-athletes — or at least USC and Pac-12 student-athletes — would have the opportunity to play this fall. I had all sorts of ideas for my articles. But, on Aug. 11, the Pac-12 decided to postpone all athletics until spring. As a biological sciences major who is also pursuing minors in health policy and economics, I uncovered a unique intersection between the worlds of sports and medicine during this pandemic. 
Although this disrupted some of my plans for this column, I believe this was a wise decision by the conference because it helped ensure the safety of its student-athletes. Many schools in the Pac-12 are located in or near large metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles (USC and UCLA), the San Francisco-Bay Area (Stanford and Cal), Seattle (Washington), and Tucson (Arizona). So, unless student-athletes were regularly tested and kept in a well-built bubble (see the NBA bubble as an example), they would potentially infect many others in these cities while traveling all over the West Coast. Though USC and other Pac-12 schools now face significant financial losses, at the end of the day, it greatly alleviates the risk of student-athletes spreading the virus in some of the country’s hotspots.
Still, other conferences — most notably the SEC, Big 12 and ACC — are, for now, resuming sports for this season. Although many schools in these conferences are not located in large cities compared to the Pac-12, their decision isn’t immune to health and safety criticism. 
As a Kansas native, the closest Power 5 school to me is the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kan. The University is testing all students who wish to come back to campus so that no one who is infected with the coronavirus enters. 
Although that sounds like an effective plan at first, this will eventually fail. For instance, USC’s rival Notre Dame, which implemented a similar plan to KU, recently had an influx of cases. 
According to an Aug. 19 CBS News report, the South Bend, Ind. campus had at least 222 confirmed coronavirus cases two weeks into the semester resulting from off-campus parties.
Now, Notre Dame has switched to entirely online instruction due to this increase in cases. These seemingly isolated college towns prove that there will be severe health risks at all schools in these conferences, and we haven’t even mentioned the schools in larger cities such as Georgia Tech in Atlanta or the University of Texas in Austin. 
Sure, the KU and Notre Dame infection spikes are not solely the responsibility of student-athletes, but these students who get infected at parties or other venues will inevitably come into contact with student-athletes who will compete at other schools, and so goes the transmission story.
Behind every student-athlete, there are a slate of at-risk coaches, trainers, equipment managers and the like. As we have seen in the past few months, this pandemic is built on a chain reaction. So, if these conferences and schools don’t want to be liable for further community transmission, the first step they should take is to either severely limit the number of students who can enter campus in the first place or make student-athletes reside, practice and compete far away from the general student body. On top of that, as I previously stated, these student-athletes must get regularly tested and be kept in a bubble, unless they are traveling to another school to compete.  
As I hear all these other conferences planning to resume sports for the fall, another health-related danger on my mind is the approach of flu season. As you may have already heard from many health experts, the flu is going to make COVID-19 much worse. 
“The worst-case scenario is we have a very active flu season that overlaps with the respiratory infection of COVID-19,” Director of the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a recent interview with the American College of Cardiology. “That would really complicate matters from a diagnostic standpoint, from a therapeutic standpoint, and the standpoint of putting a lot of stress on the health care system.” 
Even though many schools in the SEC have warmer climates and may not experience the flu as harshly, I know from experience that Kansas gets extremely cold come October, and northern ACC schools such as Pittsburgh and Boston College will be even colder. To say that a sports season is dangerous amid this epidemiological collide is an understatement. 
In the interest of safety and health, the safest idea for the rest of these conferences is to follow the actions of the Pac-12 and Big Ten and postpone athletics until spring. Although I did provide some general health policies the conferences could put in place, they are still hard to achieve, especially considering the fact we’re talking about college students rather than professional athletes, making any strict or restrictive plan financially taxing.
If the Big 12, SEC, ACC and other conferences resume this fall, they should keep in mind the health of those involved in collegiate athletics as well as those who reside near the universities.

Featuring a stunning performance by SiR and smooth, fresh vocals from two up-and-coming student artists Kyle Lux and Jordyn Simone, USC’s Welcome Back concert was held virtually Saturday. Partnering with the Black Student Assembly, Concerts Committee live streamed the event from its YouTube channel, beginning the afternoon with an impactful message.
“After the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and countless other Black lives in America, it has become quite obvious that the systems of oppression and racism are still prevalent in America to this day and are something that we need to address … That starts with our community at USC, that starts with us,” said BSA co-executive director Calvin Carmichael, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts. 
Following the statement, many Trojans said they would like to see their USC experience change.
“I want my USC to feel like home,” said Leoncya Ngoma, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global economy. “I want to feel accepted. I want to feel cared for. And I want to feel safe.”
Lux, born Kyle Tolbert, a junior majoring in popular music performance, opened his set with a rendition of his 2019 single “Lightyear.” His smooth vocals were slowed down from the original track, making for an emotional performance. The soothing, background electric guitar, played by Eli Bramnick, a junior majoring in popular music performance, highlighted Lux’s pure vocal talent. 
Visually, the set consisted of burnt orange and blue lighting, adding to the alternative, R&B feel. Next, he debuted an unreleased track with vocals that could only be topped by the beautiful and clever lyrics “Spinning like vinyls / Yeah bad case of record love.”
Fellow popular music performance major Simone, born Jordyn Warren, followed Lux’s act. Simone, a Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter and actress who previously competed on both “American Idol” and “The Voice!” Her performance continued the subtle pop and R&B feel of the night by keeping the set simple with her voice and a single electric guitar. 
Simone’s stunning, soulful voice spoke for itself as she performed unreleased songs: “I want you, want you to be happy, for us to be happy.” Dancing while consistently nailing her live vocals, Simone brought a fun energy to her next song: “Baby don’t drown on my drip,” she crooned. 
Afterward, singer, songwriter and producer SiR took the stage for a brief Q&A with Concerts Committee’s co-executive director Samantha Gibbs. Gibbs asked the headliner about his first gold plaque that he won this week signifying selling 500,000 copies of his song “Hair Down,” featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar. 
“I can’t even describe the feeling, you know, I’ve been working in the music industry for a good 10 plus years and I used to write songs for other people … it’s a great feeling because it’s my song,” SiR said. 
SiR said that “Hair Down” is his favorite of his songs, while his most beloved project is his first mixtape, “Wooden Voodoo,” which comprises 21 personally mixed songs. He praised his label, Top Dawg Entertainment, which boasts artists like Lamar, SZA, ScHoolboy Q and Zacari. SiR also cited his mother, Jackie Gouche, as an inspiration, as she sang backup vocals for Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and other famous artists.
SiR’s performance began with surrounding sounds of a plane taking flight and merged into the animated visuals from his “John Redcorn” music video. Two guitarists and one drummer took the stage to back SiR, who displayed his impressive vocal range while performing “You Can’t Save Me,” which ended with multiple vocal runs. He followed with flawless, impassioned live versions of “LA Lisa,” “All in My Head” and “Fire.” These emotive tracks were accompanied by subtly changing, corresponding background visuals.
Next, a highlight of the event was the transition and vocal performance of “Ooh Nah Nah” (originally featuring Masego). SiR’s vocals grew even more powerful throughout the performance, crescendoing as he soulfully belted a slower version of “Wires in the Way” and seamlessly transitioned into a cover of “Is This Love” by Bob Marley. 
The headliner mentioned watching USC football games as a lifelong fan and wanting to attend the school. During the entire performance, SiR made it feel like the audience was there and expressed his hope to be invited back for a future, in-person performance at USC.
“Nonetheless, I can’t wait to get the actual visit to SC and do one of these shows,” SiR said. “I heard these turn-up, like crazy.” Another USC connection was former student and Seattle native singer and songwriter UMI who provided the recorded Japanese vocals for the intro to SiR’s “Mood.” 
Following the track “The Recipe,” SiR gave listeners a humble message about his journey to the top.
“I came into this like, I just want to make music and pay my rent,” he said.“I’m honored that you guys would even ask me to do a show that you guys get big-name acts to come out and do every year.” 
SiR brought the energy, pulling Caribbean sounds into his last song, “Hair Down,” and danced with his band to close the stellar concert.

After weeks of anticipation, the occasional promotional photo and a 28-second teaser that broke Blackpink’s record for the most-viewed music video teaser in 24 hours, BTS’s “Dynamite” was released Aug. 21. The music video became the fastest YouTube video to reach 10 million views — done so in 20 minutes — and the most-viewed YouTube video in 24 hours with 101.1 million views. 
The boy group noted that the song intends to comfort and energize fans in light of the coronavirus. Members mentioned that they felt “powerless” and “frustrated” after the pandemic dismantled their plans for a world tour. 
“We wish we could give you strength in this time of exhaustion … we hope that a lot of people cheer up and take comfort in the song,” said BTS member Suga in a recent global press conference. 
Perhaps most notably, “Dynamite” is BTS’s first song sung entirely in English. 
“It wasn’t easy, but when we recorded in English, we could feel a different vibe from our previous songs, so we wanted to show our fans a new side of BTS,” said BTS member Kim Seok-jin. 
Among myriad musical achievements, BTS has charted three Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 with predominantly Korean lyrics. While having an English-only track may lead to greater radio play and Western coverage, it’s not integral to the group’s success. 
“Dynamite” is an upbeat disco-pop track with funk and soul elements heavily inspired by the ’70s and ’80s. This theme echoes in the members’ vintage-inspired outfits and the nostalgic settings featured in the music video. 
It is very much a summer song, with light and breezy lyrics and a catchy hook that will stick in your head for days. The funky bassline, layered vocals and synth all are nice callbacks to the era, making it an undeniably infectious song. 
The music video only enhances the experience. From a poster-studded bedroom with tributes to David Bowie and The Beatles to a warmly-lit record store, the backgrounds are aesthetically pleasing and add a nostalgic feel. The choreography includes shoutouts to Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson (especially his iconic kick) as well as freestyle dance moves that are easy for viewers to follow and correspond well with the music. 
“Dynamite” isn’t as musically creative as the group’s past singles like “On” or “Blood, Sweat, & Tears” and honestly never claimed to be — it’s a poppy track meant to be a reprieve in hard times. The lyrics were written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar, first-time collaborators with BTS and the songwriters behind the recent “What A Man Gotta Do” by the Jonas Brothers. None of the lyrics in “Dynamite” are particularly meaningful; some of the lines are somewhat cliché (“Can you hear the bass boom”) and some don’t quite make sense (“Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got the medicine so you should keep ya eyes on the ball”). 
However, the lyrics are mostly appealing and the fact that it’s sung completely in English is impressive. While all of the members can speak English, RM is the only one who is fluent. The chorus, “Shining through the city with a little funk and soul / So I’ma light it up like dynamite, woah” and bridge stand out in particular — they’re especially catchy and ready-made for the dance floor. 
The key change in the last two verses, along with the diverse instrumentation of horns, electric guitar, drums, percussion and synthesizers, makes the song easy to listen to repeatedly without feeling bored. Additionally, the autotune use in the song isn’t excessive; it’s easy to distinguish between the members’ voices, unlike in “Black Swan.” 
Overall, “Dynamite” is a fun summer bop that will immediately energize listeners. The 1970s-80s inspiration, infectious beat and uplifting lyrics all make it a fierce contender for the song of the summer and gives viewers a much-needed boost of energy during these hard times.

With only four days left before the release of her highly anticipated fifth studio album, “Smile,” Katy Perry joined the °1824 team of Universal Music Group for a virtual press conference, revealing details about her personal growth and how that transcends into the various themes and backstories of her songs on the album. 
Preceded by her singles “Daisies” and “Smile,” the album is finally coming to life Friday after what she cited as necessary production delays, which pushed the original release date back by two weeks. 
Perry began working on songs for “Smile” without a formal record in mind two years ago. It was a way for her to create something she felt her soul needed to say. 
Wearing a matching pink and white daisy outfit (possibly as a wink to her single, “Daisies”) complete with a silk headscarf, Perry hopped into the Zoom call with a smile on her face. Just like her song says, she “finally got back that smile.”
During the press conference, Perry confessed that she wrote the record during one of the darkest times of her life. 
“I didn’t really plan for the next day or didn’t necessarily want to,” Perry said. “I was very flatlined, and I was kind of clinically depressed, which is something I had never dealt with.” 
The 35-year-old pop singer, who has opened up about her clinical depression before, found it challenging to go about her everyday life facing the darkness. 
“I’d only dealt with depression in short, small bouts [and when I did] I felt like I could solve it,” she said. “[But] this time, I couldn’t solve it. I definitely could not get out of bed.”
Perry is also expecting her first child with fiancé Orlando Bloom any day now. She said that, despite the obstacles she’s faced on her darker days, she’s elated to bring life into the world, to choose to live and to make plans for the future. 
“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, but sometimes you have to walk through hell to get that strength,” Perry said. “This record really speaks about my own experience of walking through that and coming out alive.”
Finding that strength and courage helped Perry write some of the most hopeful and empowering songs on her album. One of those songs is “What Makes a Woman,” which Perry calls a trick question.
“If you can actually answer what makes a woman … if you have some definite statement, you may not be a woman,” Perry said.
The acoustic music video for the song was released Aug. 20 and features Perry in an intimate concert-like setting wearing a purple dress with white polka dots and singing directly to the camera as if performing for listeners in the same room. It is a power ballad filled with emotion, power and grace.
“What Makes a Woman” is a nod to all women of the world with lyrics that read, “Could spend your whole life but you couldn’t / Describe what makes a woman / And that’s what makes a woman to me.”
The “Teenage Dream” singer also revealed that songs on the album such as “It’s Not the End of the World,” “Teary Eyes” and “Only Love” discuss how it can be difficult to shift your perspective on life when every day feels like you’re going through the motions and hiding behind a happy face. 
“Only Love” is a beautiful, deeply emotional song. Beginning with a mellow-paced chord progression, the song quickly picks up for the chorus with classic pop beats. The messages in the track are personal ones to Perry. She mentions calling her mother and pouring her heart out in a letter to her father. 
“I was just in this negative loop, and I had to snap out of it,” Perry said. “Obviously, it wasn’t as easy as snapping my fingers, but once I figured out there was another way to look at life, I started seeing it with a different view.”
The singer also revealed a lot of parallels in the album that have taken on a completely new meaning due to the pandemic and current events. There’s a synonymous feeling of heaviness around the world, and Perry admits she’s been in and out of her smile these days because of it. 
Consequently, Perry said themes of hopefulness and resilience are present in the record. 
Even though resilience and joy are significant themes throughout “Smile,” Perry revealed that she’s typically feeling the opposite when she writes a song in that headspace. The songs become a reminder from her higher self that she can get through even the toughest times. 
Perry also revealed that throughout her career, she uses humor to bring levity to the seriousness of life, and in that same way, the overarching theme of this new record has a degree of clownery to it. 
“I’ve always felt a little bit like the court jester,” Perry said. “And I’ve always had a little bit of humor injected into everything I do and self-deprecation.”
Perry said she is thrilled to see her creative fans lean into the theme of the album, as she hopes to bring it to life next year in a more in-person, 3D way. 
For religious reasons, Perry “wasn’t allowed to participate in Halloween” so she’s making up for lost time. 
Not only does Perry enjoy experimenting with her eccentric costumes, but also with her music. She continues to experiment with different sonic landscapes and doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. This record, she said, is a lot like the pure pop tones in “Prism” and “Teenage Dream” with a hint of escapism.
“There’s a song called ‘Cry About It Later’ which is really about drinking too much champagne on ice and getting under someone to get over someone,” Perry said. “Sometimes you just need that.”
With the uncertainty of what the future holds for herself, her family and her child, Perry said she sees this record as a reminder of the many emotional peaks and valleys she’s made it through. She’s glad she can always hit play and remember she has the strength to overcome anything. 
“I understand why people are like ‘When the bars open, I will be there and I will be there all night because I no longer want to listen to what my thoughts say,’ especially during this time,” Perry said. “It’s too fucking intense.”
Given the stress of the pandemic, Perry admits she will enjoy a couple of dirty martinis herself after she gives birth to her daughter.
“Life gets real the longer that you live it, but it does get more expansive if you can survive it,” Perry said.
The pop star admits many people publicly would like to put her in a box, especially from 2008 to 2016 with her trademark blue or black hair and all the sweet candy props.
Perry admitted that in her 20s she thought life was going to be wild forever. But when it begins to shift slightly and reality sets in, she explained it acts as a check and the lyrics in the title track “That ego check saved my life, had a piece of humble pie” allude to that. 
“I’m just grateful for the journey and the growth,” Perry said. “I think every day you gotta push yourself to evolve mentally.” 
Perry, born Katheryn Hudson, signed a record deal with Capitol Records in 2008. But music didn’t start there for the singer. Her teenage years were spent pursuing gospel music and later transitioning to creating music separately from religion. Being more sheltered and restricted in her younger years, she felt she had the opportunity to break out of that one frame of mind her upbringing gave. 
“I really broke out of that mold but had to do some re-education, and I’ve done a lot of that re-education in the spotlight,” Perry said.
Moments before the livestream came to a close, Perry said “I think this year is really a year of reckoning and coming to terms. I think it’s so absolutely necessary and uncomfortable and painful, but rebirth was never meant to be neat and tidy.”
It’s been ten years since “Teenage Dream.” Whether you remember her for her jet black hair or her chandelier costume at the 2019 Met Gala, the pop star seems happy to share her journey and voice on “Smile” with fans Friday. She hopes “Smile” will bring light, hope, happiness, strength, fun and fantasy to listeners.

Laura Mosqueda will step down from her position as dean of Keck School of Medicine of USC next month to focus on expanding the University’s geriatric efforts, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Monday. Mosqueda will be replaced by Dr. Narsing Rao in the interim, who has served as the Grace and Emery Beardsley Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology. 
“Serving as dean of the Keck School of Medicine has been an honor,” Mosqueda wrote in a statement. “I had the benefit of an outstanding team, and together we made important strides for the school and the community that KSOM can build on for years to come.”
Mosqueda’s work will now focus on expanding the University’s existing geriatrics program, which USC aims to direct more resources toward, according to an email Zukoski sent to the Keck community announcing her departure.
“The devastating impact of the pandemic on older adults exposed existing vulnerabilities that only now are being widely recognized as important in their care, even unrelated to COVID-19,” he wrote. “Dean Mosqueda’s deep knowledge, innovations, and leadership skills will be invaluable to the University, the medical profession, and communities in reassessing and reshaping programs in geriatric health and elder justice.”
Most recently, Mosqueda has spearheaded several research initiatives and the development of programs within USC and the broader community focused on understanding the coronavirus and promoting safety and prevention. She will end her tenure as dean Sept. 15 and will work with Rao to ensure a smooth transition, she said.
Mosqueda stepped into the position of dean at Keck in 2018, following the resignations of both Carmen Puliafito for drug-related misconduct in 2016 and Rohit Varma for alleged sexual harassment in 2017. Over the last two years, she created the Office for Health & Biomedical Science Education to provide resources for faculty, students in both graduate and doctoral programs and postdoctoral scholars. She has also developed programming focused on addressing health disparities through new offices, such as the Office for Social Justice and the Center for Gender Equity in Medicine and Science.
“Dean Mosqueda has led with conviction, courage, and clarity, always with an eye on doing the right thing and treating people with fairness, candor, and respect,” Zukoski wrote in the email. “Her dedication to ensuring exceptional clinical care, education, and research are foundational to the school. Her willingness to step up at a time of great uncertainty is characteristic of the strong leader she is.”

What do a journalism major with a sports media minor and a cinema and media studies major have in common? Enough to argue about.Think of this as an introduction, the only edition of this column in an explanatory format. Every edition after this will read as a running dialogue between the two of us about a number of subjects under the umbrella topic of sports entertainment, including narrative films, television shows and documentaries.We felt that a written conversation was the best way to display our thoughts in the most engaging manner. Sports and movies are particularly ripe topics for fun and informative arguments among friends, and we want this to read almost exactly that way.The cyclical nature of sports culture is inextricably linked to entertainment. From beach volleyball Olympian Kerri Walsh Jennings drawing inspiration from soccer star Mia Hamm’s prominence after mainly watching male athletes on the screen, to researchers studying the effects of watching televised sports on physical activity, the connection is stronger than ever.There’s even more ways to investigate their mutual influence (if you’re willing to separate sports as its own entity from entertainment), whether it be Jim Brown and Gina Carano turning in the pads and gloves for the silver screen, Jay-Z selling his portion of the Brooklyn Nets to lead Roc Nation Sports as an agent or the Golden State Warriors becoming the “centerpiece” of a larger sports and entertainment conglomerate.It brings us here — a place that hasn’t quite been tapped as much as it can be — as our tenuous connection to sports currently relies on a cable TV, a WiFi connection and professional sports organizations throwing their players to the coronavirus wolves. Mediums such as movies, television and more are some of the ways that have brought us closer to the sports and athletes we love, and we want to discuss why they are so good at imparting those experiences.There needs to be an honest examination of how the entertainment side of sports culture exploits the same athletes that bring us to the TV or theater.We’ve seen athletes recounting the mental health suffering that goes ignored once they are past their “prime.” We saw it when the NFL Draft relayed with sickening tediousness the trials and tribulations athletes faced to even get a spot on the map. All of this highlights structural inequities of race, class, gender, sexual orientation and disability that often are swept under the rug unless it has a quantifiable entertainment “value” to it.A key motivation for us writing this column is the fact that sport is a fantastic source of original stories, and so it makes sense that it would translate to entertainment mediums. There’s inherent drama that comes with games and seasons where the outcome is unknown, which is the entire basis of movies and television (as long as no one spoils them for you). We track the streaks and runs of games and seasons for the same reason we follow “Game of Thrones” to the bitter, bitter end: We want to find out what happens, who wins and who loses.That leads us to the first — though not necessarily most important — purpose we want this column to fill: It will be a space for us to explore how the storytelling structures of movies, TV and documentaries apply to sports.Sometimes the sports side of the story is too good to stray away from (as was the case in “Miracle”). Sometimes sports are used as a way to ground the story and provide an intriguing subplot (like in “Uncut Gems”). And sometimes sport is lazily thrown in a way that spits on the entire industry (clearly, “Duff” didn’t have anyone on staff who had seen a snap of football in their life and could keep Robbie Amell’s travesty of a throwing motion from seeing the light of day).We will also examine how documentaries go about telling the stories of things that really happened. For example, we can reflect on a long overdue portrait of the “Women of Troy” and their influence that will last generations. Or, after we watch “The Last Dance,” do we really want to accept that Michael Jordan could be a total jerk, or do we want to keep the image of our idols alive and well?Second, we’d like the column to serve as a forum for us to discuss and appreciate how sports entertainment adds to sports culture. A lot of the stories we discuss will be fictional, but they still teach viewers a lot about sports’ core values and place in society. “Rocky,” “The League” and “The Fab Five” center on the important roles of competitiveness, social life and capitalism in sports, respectively, and those are just a few examples of the lessons we can learn from these mediums.Lastly, since we are both sports and entertainment nerds, this will be a place for us to geek out on some of our favorite viewing experiences. So expect to see “White Men Can’t Jump” brought up at least once. Maybe we’ll mention the ESPN 30 for 30 “Trojan War” segment, too.Aidan Berg and Lauren Mattice are seniors writing about sports culture and entertainment. They are also the deputy outreach director and digital managing editor of the Daily Trojan, respectively. Their column, “Screen & Roll,” runs every other Monday.

No single member of a cappella girl group Citizen Queen is alike: All five women come from different states and different ethnic backgrounds, but that’s only the beginning. As vocalists, each has a distinct sound and style. Instead of fitting a group mold, these women draw inspiration from one another’s  strengths and lean into their individuality, coming together like pieces in a puzzle.  
Nina Nelson, Kaedi Dalley, Hannah Mrozak, Cora Isabel and Kaylah Sharve’ compose Citizen Queen. They’ve already stunned millions of viewers on YouTube with their perfect harmony and created magic on stage during their first tour as openers for Pentatonix. It’s shocking to learn that they were complete strangers before the group’s founding, aside from Nelson and Sharve’, who both graduated from USC and were members of the SoCal VoCals, the University’s oldest a cappella group.
“I don’t think I’ve met a group of people who are more different from each other, but that’s the beauty of it,” Nelson, the group’s soprano, said. “Musically, in personality, in what kind of things or experiences we’ve had in order to get to this point … it can’t be about competition when there’s so much to learn from each other.” 
SoCal VoCals alumnus and member of the world-renowned a cappella group Pentatonix Scott Hoying, along with alumni Ben Bram and Shams Ahmed, two acclaimed vocal arrangers and producers, hand-selected each member of Citizen Queen. The co-founders spent months sorting through hundreds of audition tapes until they hosted in-person callbacks in Los Angeles and New York, according to the members.
Isabel, the group’s gifted beatboxer, was still in high school when she joined Citizen Queen as its first member. After only sending in a couple of videos to Hoying, Bramm and Ahmed, she was quickly chosen without an in-person audition. Even more impressive is that her beatboxing abilities are self-taught.
“One day in sixth grade, I was sitting at the lunch table singing some Adele song to myself,” Isabel said. “I remembered being able to just hum and beatbox with it and make cool noises with it and was like ‘That sounds cool,’ and it honestly just became a habit.” 
Once all the members were chosen, Citizen Queen’s spark came to life at an Airbnb in L.A. where they recorded four fully produced songs and music videos in one week. The women faced obstacles right off the bat: Mrozak had strep throat, Isabel was sick and ants had infested their living space, Nelson said. Despite these hurdles, the group’s dynamic was magnetic; this was their first time collaborating in any way, shape or form.
“Just because the five of us are amazing singers, it doesn’t mean that we’ll have the chemistry that is needed for an audience to love us,” Nelson said. “It doesn’t mean that we’ll get along, you know, so we were kind of put to the test.” 
To their delight, not only did the women have unimaginable chemistry but their first projects were well-received. Their most popular video to date, “Evolution of Girl Groups,” has accumulated more than 18 million views. Beginning in 1954 with The Chordettes and ending in 2014 with Fifth Harmony, Citizen Queen takes us on a seamless journey through legendary hits of past and present girl groups. The concept of the video is wildly creative and was difficult to compose and choreograph.
“I remember almost having a mental breakdown, if not one for sure, because it was so brutal and so hot …  It was supposed to be a continuous shot, so we had to nail every single scene, so there was a lot of reviewing things,” mezzo-soprano Mrozak said about the filming of the music video. “I think there was a moment in there where we were all like ‘Is this even worth it?’ But then we all ended up realizing very quickly that this is what we want to do with our lives, you have to put in the work … but it’s the finished project that counts. We were so happy with it … and I remember we saw the views just go up and up and up, and we were genuinely taken aback.”
Shortly after discovering their sound and harmony, the members of Citizen Queen received their second test: a nine-week world tour opening for Pentatonix. Although they didn’t know each other that well yet, the tour gave Citizen Queen the opportunity to understand what it was like to be professionals in the music industry, and sharing that experience bonded the women greatly. 
“For me, it was beneficial to just be in that setting of being on tour and sound checking every night and being on the road and being in a tour bus with all of these people,” alto Sharve’ said. “It’s just getting us prepared for what’s to come, and I’m believing [in] great things.” 
The tour was not only a productive learning experience for Citizen Queen but also a chance for the group to gain a large fan base.
“I didn’t imagine in a million years that I would perform at Madison Square Garden that early [in my career], but here we are,” bass singer Dalley said. “Wherever we went, the crowd was so receptive of us and very welcoming, and it seemed like they were very impressed with what they heard. It gave me a little bit of fire sometimes whenever I had down days. I’d just think of how people receive us and how we bring a lot to the table.” 
Citizen Queen’s most memorable moment on tour was when the group was able to perform near each of the members’ hometowns for family and friends, Mrozak said. 
Tyler Ellis, a 2020 graduate, had been close friends with Nelson since his freshman year when he was able to see Citizen Queen twice on its first tour. He described how he knew Citizen Queen had untapped potential after observing the members’ powerful stage presence.
“When I saw them live for the first time … I was screaming because all five of them … come together, and their blend is so incredible,” Ellis said. 
Unstoppable is exactly how members of Citizen Queen want their listeners to feel. Their mission is to empower women and help every girl listener realize that they have a queen living inside of them, which is precisely how they came up with the name Citizen Queen, according to Dalley. Whether it’s because of their different cultural backgrounds or their diverse life experiences, the women hope that any listener can identify with at least one member of the group.
“It’s so easy to  let your identity slip when you don’t see people like you on the screen, and representation is so important when you’re a young person trying to build self esteem and confidence,” Nelson said. “We live in a specific time in history where more and more women are taking less shit, and our music is becoming less about the man and more about empowering ourselves.” 
Although the group hasn’t released original music yet, there’s a lot to look forward to in Citizen Queen’s future, according to Sharve’. 
“We are so passionate about our original music  and are working with some heavy hitters in the industry,” Sharve’ said. “We’re excited about it, I’m excited about it and the label is excited about it.”

In the wake of both a pandemic and civil unrest, the nonprofit sector is undoubtedly becoming an exceedingly important tool for the public. Whether it’s through donations to Feeding America’s food banks for their coronavirus response fund or the $30 million donated to the Minnesota Defense Fund following George Floyd’s killing, it is clear that people rely on nonprofits to support public issues and cultivate change when the government and private sector fail to act. 
As an NGOs and social change major, I am continuously learning the ins and outs of nonprofits and the philanthropy sector — the good, the bad and the ugly. Now more than ever, nonprofits offer a clear path to a better, brighter future. Even if you are not looking to work in the nonprofit sector postgrad, awareness of how nonprofits can serve as a vehicle for social change would benefit you as a donor or volunteer, while also allowing you to hold nonprofits accountable. 
A major way we can hold nonprofits accountable is by addressing the lack of diversity in their leadership. Although there has been a concentrated effort on addressing the lack of diverse representation in Fortune 500 companies and other for-profit enterprises, the same problems exist within nonprofits — but there seems to be no notable call for change in that sector. This must be addressed. 
A 2018 report found that 87% of all executive directors or presidents in nonprofits were white. This astoundingly high number is not just a fluke from 2018. A 2019 report by the Building Movements Project reported that the percentage of people of color in the executive director role has remained under 20% for the last 15 years. 
Moreover, this lack of representation is not confined to the position of executive director. Boards, which executive directors work under, are also shockingly homogeneous. For instance, a 2018 study conducted by the Indiana University Lilly School of Philanthropy found that nonprofit boards are 78.6% white, 7.5% Black, 4.2% Latinx and 2.6% Asian, with Black, Latinx and Asian board members underrepresented based on population statistics. 
USC, a not-for-profit university, is unfortunately not an exception when it comes to the dismal representation in leadership of nonprofits. In Fall 2016, the Board of Trustees was 73% white compared to 32% of the student population. In 2019, the executive voting committee within the Board of Trustees, an exclusive group that holds voting power when the rest of the board is not present, was also mostly white. For reference, this committee directly oversaw the investigation of how USC handled the case of former Keck School of Medicine Dean Dr. Carmen A. Puliafito. Accordingly, the leadership at USC comes nowhere near an accurate reflection of its student body.
Given that nonprofits often work in communities of color, this homogeneity of leadership creates a disconnect between these entities and the communities they serve. The lack of diverse viewpoints and backgrounds integral to the very core of programming means nonprofits are not delivering on their missions as well as they could and should. 
When leadership does not represent the student body or its community, how can a board be expected to make the best decisions for those it serves or truly understand the challenges a community faces? Nonprofits, including USC, must take concrete steps to increase diversity of leadership in their organizations with the goal of effectively and fairly accomplishing their stated missions. 
It must be acknowledged, however, that some for-profit organizations can make large investments into diversity and inclusion initiatives in a way that nonprofit organizations, who often lack financial flexibility, cannot. 
Despite having less financial resources than for-profit ventures, nonprofits can still make real, sustainable changes. For one, definitive metric goals for diversity can be used as a systematic way to ensure annual progress is made. Additionally, a focus on training for unbiased interviewing and selection processes allows for a more fair recruitment process. Nonprofits must also have open internal discussions about where diversity is lacking, why that is a problem and how members can work to find a solution. 
We task nonprofits with solving complex, important issues at both a domestic and international level, yet fail to equip those organizations with leaders of varied backgrounds, races and ethnicities. The dominant presence of white executive directors and white boards feels eerily similar to the idea of the “white savior complex” — that somehow it is solely the job of white leaders to impart wisdom and lead the charge in service to charitable organizations and marginalized communities.  
With more diverse leadership that leads to the inclusion of more diverse viewpoints and experiences, nonprofits can better live up to their missions and sustain the change that is so desperately needed from their work.

On Aug. 5, former Undergraduate Student Government Vice President Rose Ritch announced her resignation in a letter to the student body. In both her letter and subsequent op-ed to Newsweek, Ritch described consistent online harassment and calls for her resignation or impeachment over her Zionist views. A formal impeachment motion also called for Ritch’s removal, though it did not reference her Zionism and will not be substantively addressed in this letter. 
Instead, I want to analyze and break down the most jarring claim of Ritch’s letter, a claim that was amplified by President Carol Folt and repeated over and over again by dozens of advocacy groups and media outlets: the claim that the harassment Ritch faced was antisemitic. 
As a Jewish student, I was alarmed to read Folt’s statement, which referenced antisemitic attacks on our USG vice president. While I was familiar with the fact that some student activists had been calling for Ritch’s resignation because she was a Zionist, I was shocked and disappointed to learn that Ritch’s Zionist beliefs had made her the target of antisemitic attacks. In a semi-panicked state, I sought out Ritch’s resignation letter, needing to see the hateful conduct myself. 
I couldn’t find it. Instead, I saw Ritch describe the same social media campaign I was already familiar with, which argued that Ritch’s support for Israel made her complicit in racism (and therefore a racist). Central to Ritch’s story was one unnamed student’s demand to “impeach her Zionist ass.” Kind? Certainly not. But antisemitic? I didn’t see it. 
Nevertheless, Ritch’s allegation of antisemitism was repeated by Folt and by dozens of antisemitism watchdog organizations and pundits, including Ben Shapiro. It is certainly worth examining and breaking down her argument.
She starts off by presenting Zionism as inextricable from Judaism, citing the misleading statistic that 95% of American Jews support Israel, which, she says, makes it so that “an attack on [her] Zionist identity is an attack on [her] Jewish identity.” She then goes on to write: “The suggestion that my support for a Jewish homeland would make me unfit for office, or would justify my impeachment, plays into the oldest and most wretched stereotypes of Jews: accusations of dual loyalty and holding all Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli government.” 
This would make sense if Ritch had been assumed to be a Zionist or pro-Israel because of her faith — but in her letter, Ritch herself writes that she “openly identifies as Zionist.” Moreover, her LinkedIn page states that she has served as co-president of Trojans For Israel for the past two years. It doesn’t matter what religion you are — the reality is that if you, the former vice president of USG, are leading a pro-Israel organization on campus, people are going to be upset by that fact, for reasons that have nothing to do with your faith. 
In fact, conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism only serves to perpetuate the dual-loyalty trope. Being Jewish is not the same as being a Zionist or supporting Israel. But when Ritch states that an attack on one’s Zionist identity is the same as attacking one’s Jewish identity, she says exactly that. Does Ritch believe that I attack my own identity every day by virtue of my political positions? Would she look me in the eyes and tell me that supporting Palestinians’ claims to the land that was stolen from them invalidates my Jewish identity?
I agree wholeheartedly that Ritch’s Zionism does not disqualify her from holding office, just as I would agree that someone’s anti-Zionism would not disqualify them, either. However, students should be allowed to express their own ideas about the personal politics they want from their official representatives; to say otherwise is to restrict freedom of speech. 
When an elected representative vehemently supports an ideology that rests upon the displacement of countless Palestinian people from their homes, people are going to be angry. If an elected representative were to tout the idea that the Jewish people should not be allowed to establish a home in Judea, I have no doubt that people would be angry, then, too. This is the inevitable and natural outcome of elected representatives making controversial issues central to their activist efforts. Now, that does not mean that student leaders should be afraid to take controversial political stances — but it does mean that they should expect dissent.
The problem arises when people in positions of power, such as Folt and Ritch, label this natural dissent as antisemitic — a problem that gets amplified when that condemnation is echoed by various media outlets. Folt and Ritch could have talked about political intolerance in their letters. They could have talked about how, as a community, we should resist allowing our political differences to mutate into hostile and harassing tendencies. Instead, they presented the student body with a divisive message, slandering all recent criticism of Ritch’s Zionism as racist. Make no mistake: This is its own form of intolerance, one that uses unsound identity politics to shut down legitimate concerns from the students Ritch was elected to represent.
In doing so, Folt and Ritch rewrote history to exclude and gloss over the actual reasons that were cited in the impeachment motion and why various student organizations wanted Ritch to resign. They erased the voices of the Black Student Assembly, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Latinx Student Assembly, Environmental Student Assembly, Students for Justice in Palestine and Asian Pacific American Student Assembly — all of whom called for Ritch to resign along with former USG President Truman Fritz after allegations emerged that Fritz had a repeated history of microaggressions and that Ritch had remained silent and complicit by his side (it is worth mentioning that Folt never even acknowledged the role these voices played after Fritz’s resignation). These are substantive and legitimate reasons for Ritch’s removal, thrown to the wayside in favor of divisive and minimizing rhetoric about a few angry students on social media. 
It is regrettable that these voices were erased in the story of Ritch’s resignation. It is too bad that passionate student activists for social justice were uniformly dismissed as racists from the highest powers at this institution. And it is a shame that in a moment that calls for unity, our University continues to divide its student body.

Club and campus activities will certainly look different this semester, but student organizations and supporting staff are making it a priority to replicate the college experience as best as possible remotely. 
For performance groups such as Grupo Folklórico de USC, this semester comes with challenges on how to maintain the quality of their club offerings for their members as well as the greater USC community.
In an effort to keep business as usual, Grupo Folklórico de USC, a Mexican folk dance and cultural group, has adapted its regular meetings to fit an online format. According to GFU president Samantha Nuñez, since most of the organization’s veteran members will be in the Los Angeles area, they will be able to pre-record dance tutorial videos for incoming members to learn. 
“We’re also hosting weekly Zoom sessions to give everyone access to us and make sure that people know that, ‘Hey, we may not be doing this in person, but we have these videos for you to learn from,’” said Nuñez, a graduate student studying communication management. 
In addition to online member meetings, student organizations have also found creative digital alternatives to share their passions with the USC community. USC’s ten a cappella groups traditionally organize a semesterly show, All Hail A Capella, for the USC student body. However, due to the inability to hold in-person rehearsals and restrictions on performance venues, Trogons is working to make the performance virtually accessible through streaming platforms like YouTube and Facebook. 
Photography Club is also turning to more unconventional methods to share its work. In addition to a semesterly virtual zine, the club is working on launching a Minecraft gallery to simulate an open house for members to showcase their photos, according to club president Fiona Pestana. 
“Normally, photo club is an opportunity for students to go out and shoot and find a community where we can learn photography skills together as well as go outside of campus on events, on excursions around L.A., to  have a group to shoot together and to learn from each other,” said Pestana, a senior majoring in journalism. “But right now, [Photography Club] is going to be a virtual community where we’re going to have streams and social sessions online … and help refine the skills and inspire people to go out and shoot.”
The virtual involvement fairs, held during the first and second weeks of classes, will also provide an opportunity for registered student organizations to meet potential members.
Despite the possible difficulty of keeping students interested in online extracurricular activities, Pestana said she has had promising experiences at the virtual involvement fairs so far.
“There were quite a few freshmen coming in, so I think they were seeing this as an opportunity to start their college experience with people with similar interests,” Pestana said. “I was really excited that people showed up, which is definitely encouraging right now because hopefully, that means they’ll be staying in the future.”
Peaks and Professors president Colleen Corrigan also said she was pleasantly surprised by the turnout during the involvement fair sessions despite the limitations of meeting virtually.
“You know it’s awkward at times like every time someone new pops into the room, you have to reintroduce what the club is, so it’s a little bulky that way but it was still really fun to feel like we were meeting people at the involvement fair,” Corrigan said.
Though Photography Club has tried to make meetings as engaging as possible by teaching members how to make and photograph mocktails at home, it is also trying to maintain the social aspect as best and as safely as possible.
“One of the things we’re going to teach is how to take people’s  new and do portraits on Zoom,” Pestana said. “In this way, we can still use human subjects, and we’re encouraging members to, of course within [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines, go out and shoot in the area, shoot people they’re living with and meet up with people from a distance with masks on and take photos.” 
Corrigan, a senior majoring in human biology and NGOs and social change, also said she hopes students continue to go on outdoor adventures even without the Peaks and Professors’ in-person programming.   
“Being outside for anyone who enjoys the outdoors is such a source of mental health and therapy,” Corrigan said. “And it’s tough because as much as … I don’t want people to feel like now that there [aren’t] organized trips happening that they can’t try to organize them with their friends.”
To address this concern, Corrigan said that the club is looking to provide resources and host webinars that teach students wilderness survival tips, offer advice on what to bring and recommend their favorite hikes in the area in hopes of encouraging remote students to continue to explore the outdoors. She also admitted that she is grateful to have this time to focus on providing useful resources and tips to anyone who would want them. 
Another concern that student organizations are dealing with is maintaining member engagement because of growing Zoom fatigue. 
“It’s hard with these virtual events because you don’t want to induce any more Zoom fatigue than is already induced by just school online,” Corrigan said. “We want it to be something that people actually would gain … so we’re really trying to think about how to make it that kind of environment.” 
However, there are still some things that cannot be accomplished over Zoom and while remote. For an organization that is based on performance, like GFU, practicing at home has limitations.
“People having questions at a live practice in-person versus getting sent a video and trying to wing it on your own with guidance provided [the greatest challenge we face],” Nuñez said. “Some people may be confused about a certain step, and some of our dance routines involve skirtwork. Some of our dances can be very technical, so that’s a challenge we foresee going into the fall semester.”
For Trogons president Aaron Sha, a junior majoring in health and sciences, member engagement over virtual platforms may be the most challenging aspect of this semester. 
“You don’t get the same member reaction when you’re talking to people over Slack. You’d be lucky to get a 50% reaction rate, so trying to connect with all the members is really hard.” Sha said. “I think in the future, this issue will become more prominent as the semester moves on, people are going to be more busy.”
While student organizations are working hard to stay involved and engaged this fall, the USC administration also plans to host virtual events to engage the student body. Gabriel Valenzuela, director of campus activities, said in an email to the Daily Trojan that some of these virtual events will include game nights, craft events and trivia competitions. 
Valenzuela said he hopes students will find events they are excited to participate in and meet new people through the ExperienceSC virtual hub, prioritizing personal connections over physical space. Campus Activities has been exploring platforms outside of Zoom to bring students together in alternative spaces and avoid fatigue. 
Led by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Willow Bay, the faculty-based Student Experience Working Group was tasked with creating high-quality extracurricular activities that meet the diverse needs of the student population and that can be accessed online.
“Our assignment by the provost was initially to create a set of rich extracurricular experiences for students who wouldn’t be able to have a traditional, on campus experience and to communicate the value of the USC experience that was not tied to our physical space or physical place.” Bay said.
Visions & Voices plans to host online programming and concerts focused on social issues and inspiring resilience throughout the semester, which are available on the organization’s website. The event schedule will include cooking with L.A.-based Asian American women chefs Cecilia Leung, Isa Fabro and Sonoko Sakai, and an evening with rapper Chuck D from Public Enemy.
Daria Yudacufski, executive director of Visions & Voices, said during the USC Student Experience Webinar on July 28, they are able to take advantage of the online format because virtual events allow them to speakers who would normally be unable to travel to campus to deliver live performances.
“There’s a lot that we can do online that we’d might not be able to do in person and there’s something really intimate about [remote experiences], which I love.” Yudacufski said. 
As campus activities and clubs continue to adapt to the virtual semester, they hope they can still emulate the valuable in-person experiences that students would get on campus.
“College is a time where the relationships you develop are going to last you for an entire lifetime, and the biggest thing about remote learning is that you’re not able to see the faces that we’re used to seeing,” Sha said. “In order to try to maintain some normalcy, I just want to make sure that our members get to hang out with each other [and be social].”
