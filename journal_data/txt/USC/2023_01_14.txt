USC broke a two-game losing streak with a 68-61 win over Colorado Thursday night, seeing freshman forward Vincent Iwuchukwu’s return to the basketball court in the process. Iwuchukwu suffered sudden cardiac arrest during a workout in July and had yet to make his debut in cardinal and gold until Thursday.
“He’s an incredible person. He’s gone through a lot medically and he’s had so much support from our trainers, team doctors, our administration, his teammates,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield. 
“It was amazing. He’s been working really hard to get back and he’s been playing basketball all his life,” said senior guard Boogie Ellis.
“I personally really liked how the fans really gave him a standing ovation,” said redshirt junior forward Joshua Morgan. “I know that made his first game back … He’s probably going to remember that for a while.” 
Iwuchukwu went scoreless in his 5 minutes of play, but Enfield was not concerned about the freshman’s slow start.
“I think he’ll just get better and better,” Enfield said. “He’s a terrific player, he just hasn’t played the game in a long time … I don’t think his cardio shape is as good as it will be in a couple weeks … but it was just nice for him to get out there, get his feet wet a little bit, so to speak.” 
Ellis displayed both his scoring and passing abilities, putting up 14 points, 6 assists and 0 turnovers. Overall, the Trojans committed just 9 giveaways compared to Colorado’s 22.
“I thought Boogie was outstanding,” Enfield said. “He really controlled the flow of the game.”
“We always come to the game trying to take care of the ball. Just emphasizing, as a point guard and a leader on this team, I can’t turn over the ball,” Ellis said. “I was just emphasizing making the game easy, taking what the defense gives me and just making the right play.”
Morgan, who saw his playing time reduced in the second half of the Trojans’ 58-60 loss to UCLA, played with extra motivation on his way to a 12-point, 4-block and 3-steal performance. 
“He’s had a really good year for us this year, but like everybody else you have to produce and you have to play hard and you have to do what you’re capable of doing,” Enfield said. 
“I had a lot of motivation coming into this game. I feel like last game I kind of let my teammates down with how I played,” Morgan said. “So this entire week and this game I really had to make sure that when I came in, I wasn’t going to be a detriment, that I was going to make up for the last game. And I think I did that.” 
Ellis and Morgan ran the pick-and-roll offense well, with Morgan the beneficiary of 3 of Ellis’ assists.
“[Ellis] made the passes at the right time, he was able to get [Morgan] in some lobs, some post-touches,” Enfield said. “[Ellis] played a terrific lead guard game tonight.”
With a 1-point lead late in the game, fifth-year guard Drew Peterson hit a key two-point jumper as time expired on the shot clock to give the Trojans a 3-point lead. Peterson finished with 15 points, 3 assists and 4 steals.
In total, the Trojans had 12 steals and 9 blocks. Enfield claimed that turnovers are a remedy for USC’s difficulty rebounding the ball.
“We try to get our hands on a lot of deflections and steals and tonight it worked out,” Enfield said. “We know we’re not a great defensive rebounding team … Our bigger guys need to become better rebounders themselves and our guards have to chip in too.”
The Trojans will take on the University of Utah at Galen Center Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

A prospective union of USC graduate student workers will likely hold a hearing with the National Labor Relations Board starting Wednesday, a union representative wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Friday. 
The hearing — which will determine workers’ union eligibility — would bring the coalition one step closer to official union certification and allow the workers to strike in the future.
The University is expected to argue at the hearing that graduate student workers funded through fellowships are not employees and therefore not union-eligible, wrote Megan Cassingham, a spokesperson for the Graduate Student Worker Organizing Committee. Spokespersons for USC were not immediately able to confirm Cassingham’s assertion or the scheduled date for the hearing.
After the hearing, the NLRB will set the date of an election decided by a simple majority of union-eligible workers who are likely to vote in favor of unionization, given that roughly 60% of 3,400 workers signed union authorization cards to trigger the hearing in December.
The GSWOC seeks to join the United Auto Workers union, which represents academic workers from Harvard University, Columbia University and the University of California, among other universities across the United States.
“USC values its good relations with the unions already representing some USC employees, including our food service workers,” wrote Andrew McConnell Stott, vice provost for academic programs and dean of the graduate school, in an email to USC graduate students Wednesday. “But USC does not believe that representation by the United Auto Workers is in the best interest of our graduate students.”
This academic year, the minimum stipend for academic workers is $34,000 annually — an 11.5% increase from the 2021-22 academic year. The stipend is set to rise another 5% next year. 
The Los Angeles County living wage is $45,536 for a single adult with no children, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Living Wage Calculator — well above USC’s minimum stipend.
Stott noted in his statement that since the stipends cover half-time employment over a nine-month period, they are equivalent to a $71,400 full-time position over the same time period. Ph.D. students receive tuition waivers up to $63,468 a year.
“Grad student workers we’ve spoken with are angry about the vice provost’s email, especially the implication that low salaries are OK because you only work part time,” Cassingham wrote. “You don’t really know of anyone in the [electrical and computer engineering] department that is working less than 40 hours a week.”
UC strikers under the UAW banner thrust academic worker compensation into the spotlight in November 2022, making national headlines as they effectively grounded operations across the 10-campus university system to a halt during its finals season.
At the end of their nearly six-week strike — the largest academic worker demonstration in American history — UC academic workers won concessions that will raise their pay from around $23,250 to $34,000 for nine months of part-time work by the fall of 2024. 
UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco and UCLA workers won higher wages to the tune of $36,500. UC wrote on its website that the new contracts make the workers “among the best supported in public higher education in the country.”
“Recent contracts at other universities demonstrate that collective bargaining works,” the GSWOC wrote in an emailed statement to its members Wednesday. “By forming a union, we are joining a nationwide movement that is already raising standards for graduate worker compensation.”
