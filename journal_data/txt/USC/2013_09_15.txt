No. 23 USC came home hoping to bounce back from a tough weekend in Minnesota. Their frustrations continued as they suffered a tough 1-0 loss in overtime to Pepperdine on Friday, but the team came back with a vengeance to beat Loyola Marymount 5-1 on Sunday at McAlister Field.

The Women of Troy (4-2-1) took on Pepperdine (3-2-1) without senior midfielder Jordan Marada and head coach Ali Khosroshahin, who both picked up red cards in last Sunday’s game against LSU.
The game featured a lot of scoring chances, with both teams coming close to scoring in the first half. Pepperdine goalkeeper Hannah Seabert and junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley deflected shot after shot, making some great saves to keep the game scoreless.
It was a battle to see which offense could break through first. Despite 26 shots in regulation to Pepperdine’s 12, the Women of Troy were unable to score any points, sending the game into overtime.
A USC miscue gave the Waves’ Lynn Williams the ball on a fastbreak, leaving only Stanley in her path. Stanley took a risk and tried to rush Williams, but Williams got the ball past her and put it in the net for her sixth goal of the season to give Pepperdine a 1-0 win in the 93rd minute.
USC finished the game with 29 shots compared to Pepperdine’s 13 (11 on goal to the Waves’ eight). “It’s early enough in the season where the girls will recover and get after it tomorrow and get ready for Sunday,” assistant coach P.J. Woolridge said after Friday’s match, which he helped coach in lieu of Khosroshahin’s suspension.
Eager to get back on the right track, the Women of Troy came out firing against the Lions (3-5-0), looking more like the team that scored 12 goals in their first three games, rather than the one that scored one in their last three.
They started the scoring in the 4th minute on a goal from sophomore forward Katie Johnson, ending a streak of 233 consecutive scoreless minutes.
Just a few minutes later, senior forward Elizabeth Eddy scored her team-leading fifth goal of the season off a deflection.
Johnson then scored in the 10th minute, getting a pass in the box from Mills to give USC a 3-0 lead ten minutes into the game.
LMU’s Tawni Martino got the Lions on the scoreboard in the 18th minute, cutting the USC lead to 3-1 and accounting for the first goal allowed in the first half by the Women of Troy all season.
But Johnson came back seconds later, heading the ball into the net for a hat trick just 18 minutes into the contest. It was USC’s first hat trick since Eddy earned one in 2010 against California.
Marada put up USC’s 5th goal off the hands of LMU goalkeeper Brittany Jagger, giving them a season-high in goals scored.
“I think we figured out the movement with our forwards,” Johnson said. “Moving things just a little bit opened up the ball a lot more and our opportunities were a lot easier for us to score.”
The Lions were more aggressive on offense and managed to keep USC off the scoreboard in the second half, but were unable to generate any goals thanks to some strong goalie play from Stanley and some excellent slide tackles from senior defender Autumn Altamirano.
“When we watched the [Pepperdine] game on Saturday, they were able to see some of the choices they made against a team they sat back,” Khosroshahin said. “Today they made some good choices with possession in the final third that was able to get some good looks at goals.”
Three Stars of the Weekend
3rd star: Kayla Mills (2 assists, 8 shots, 4 shots on goal)
2nd star: Caroline Stanley                  (12 saves, .857 save percentage)
1st star: Katie Johnson (3 goals,      8 shots, 4 shots on goal)
 
After scoring one goal in USC’s previous games, Johnson led the Women of Troy on a scoring frenzy against Loyola Marymount, netting a hat trick in the first 18 minutes of the game.
Stanley ceded only two goals in more than 167 minutes of playing time, keeping USC competitive on Friday, and preventing LMU from gaining any momentum in a blowout.
Mills assisted on Johnson’s first and second goals against LMU to give her a team-leading five assists on the season.

The top-ranked Trojans beat their first ranked opponent of the 2013 season and nabbed a few more wins this past weekend at the Inland Empire Classic to extend their current winning streak to 39 games.
Diving in · Junior driver Kostas Genidounias was one of three players to record hat tricks for the Trojans against No. 10 UC San Diego in a 17-5 victory, USC’s first win over a ranked opponent this season. – Daily Trojan file photo
USC (8-0) started the weekend off on a high note by defeating No. 10 UC San Diego in their first match, 17-5. Once again, the Trojans started off with a scoring surge of eight straight goals in the first quarter, while holding the Tritons scoreless. This scoring attack was due largely in part to the first-period hat trick from senior utility player Mace Rapsey. UC San Diego would not score until midway through the second quarter, when the Trojans bounced back with three more consecutive goals.
The Trojans led 10-1 at halftime and started the second half strong with a goal by senior two-meter player Connor Virjee, who also had a hat trick. They would net five total goals in the third to take a commanding 15-4 lead heading into the final quarter, where redshirt junior driver Rex Butler and red shirt sophomore two-meter Mac Carden each added goals to cap off the win for the Trojans.
Nine different players scored for USC against the Tritons and three had hat tricks (Rapsey, Virjee and junior driver Kostas Genidounias).
Senior driver Nikola Vavic also added two goals, while senior goalie James Clark recorded nine saves in the the team’s fifth straight win of the 2013 season.
USC’s next game on Saturday against Pomona-Pitzer was even more of a lopsided matchup, as they trounced the Sagehens 24-6 in a game where the Trojans had 13 different scorers. They jumped out to a 15-4 lead at halftime, and held their ground on defense, shutting Pomona out in the fourth quarter. Vavic and Arden led the USC scoring with four goals a piece, while five other players recored multi-goal games. Redshirt junior Paul Mitre had seven saves for the Trojans.
Sunday was nothing different than Saturday for the team, who defeated Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Whittier by sizeable margins.
The Trojans started off Sunday morning by beating the Stags 19-2 before closing out the tournament with a 21-4 victory over the Poets in the afternoon.
The team passed up their longest recent winning streak of 35 in a row (2008-09) with their four wins this weekend and continues to strive to break the program’s record winning streak, which stands at 44 (2005-06).
The men will look to continue their winning streak next weekend (Sept. 21 to 22) as they head up to Northern California to play in the NorCal Tournament. Their opponents will be determined later in the week.

The USC women’s volleyball team saw its run of perfection end at the hands of the University of San Diego Friday night, but overcame the tough loss to defeat UC Santa Barbara and Eastern Washington to improve to 8-1 on the season.
Ways to go · Junior setter Hayley Crone, a two-year starter, leads USC with 6.25 assists per set, but coach Mick Haley expects more improvement. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy couldn’t muster enough to defeat the 9th-ranked Toreros, who have gone on a tear after being unranked to open the season. They fell in four sets 23-25, 25-20, 22-25, 25-19.
“I think San Diego is playing tremendously well. They’re in midseason form and they’re better than I could have ever anticipated,” head coach Mick Haley said. “That’s why I voted them No. 1 last week.”
Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu led the way with 13 kills and senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard recorded 11 kills and seven blocks, but the effort came up short. The defense failed to contain the USD duo of Chloe Ferrari and Katie Hoekman, who combined for a whopping 38 kills from the middle position.
“We should have gone up 2-0 in the match, but we gave away that first set,” Haley said. “But if they’re in midseason form and we’re still trying to figure out our lineup, then I think we’re pretty good. It was a good match for us to be in, and all the stuff we learned from that will keep making us better.”
USC quickly shook off the loss Saturday to knock off Santa Barbara 3-1. After dropping the first set 20-25, the Women of Troy dominated the remainder of the match, going 25-21, 25-15 and 26-24. Freshman outside hitter Elise Ruddins continued her opening-season tear with a team-high 24 kills, and senior outside hitter Sara Shaw posted a double-double with 10 kills and 12 digs.
The Women of Troy completed the tournament with a 3-0 sweep of the Eastern Washington Eagles (25-12, 25-23, 25-21) in the second half of a doubleheader. Ruddins (14) and sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio (12) combined for 26 kills to pace the USC attack, which has outhit their opponent in every match so far this season.
“Obviously, we want to win every game. But the fact that we were able to get two freshmen out there (in Nwanebu and Ruddins) is very helpful. I didn’t think that Bricio had a good weekend. The other teams are really going after her because they know how good she was last year. I’m looking for her to grow and accept the challenge.”
Ruddins and senior libero Natalie Hagglund were named to the all-tournament team, with Hagglund getting her third straight nod.
Haley noted that while the wins are piling up and “things are coming along well,” he still does not think the team is as good as they can be.
“We have to work out some kinks in some of our rotations. We’re very conventional and we’re not showing very much right now,” Haley said. “We’re playing basic volleyball and not trying to do a lot of fancy things.”
USC has mostly wrapped up its preconference schedule, and as it prepares to play its home opener Wednesday, Haley emphasizes that no single match will be an easy one going forward.
“It’s going to be a lot of hard work, and the kids have to stay with us,” Haley said. “I want to get a primary passer to go with the three we have right now so we can rest some people from time to time. I also want our setters to understand our system better. They have moments when they’re really good, and then they’ll take a step back. They need to keep improving.”
The Women of Troy will host UC Irvine Wednesday at the Galen Center before a Friday night match against Cal State Fullerton.
Another head coach Haley who should be on the hot seat this year. He doesn’t use his middle blockers
enough offensively, and using two setters is like the qb position in football alternating with mixed results.
The team gives away too many sets to inferior opponents so far this season. Like to have the San Diego
coach here at USC next year if possible.

After USC polished off the finishing touches on a near-perfect 35-7 victory over Boston College, the Trojans were quick to admit that the atmosphere surrounding the team’s preparations for the Eagles wasn’t ideal.
“It was really dark last week,” redshirt sophomore tailback Tre Madden said. “This [win] was a relief.”
Rumors about a players-only meeting organized by junior wide receiver Marqise Lee dominated headlines last week, stirring the media into a frenzy as the perception that head coach Lane Kiffin had lost the faith of his players received apparent credibility.
USC’s pending matchup against Boston College was essentially pushed to the backburner as Kiffin’s detractors salivated at the possibility of a player mutiny.
“It wasn’t a great week,” Kiffin said. “There wasn’t positivity around for obvious reasons.”
But as the news cycle centered around that phantom meeting, which was seemingly no more than a few players talking in the medical training room, the Trojans mostly stayed mum, focused on the task at hand — and Saturday’s results spoke for them.
“I thought these guys kept working, kept grinding and just worked extremely hard,” Kiffin said. “They didn’t let people tear them apart. They came out and performed really well today.”
Even though most lines in Las Vegas favored USC by two touchdowns, Saturday’s matchup felt like anything but a sure thing after the shocking loss to Washington State.
After last season, when USC’s mistakes snowballed through the rest of the year after a heartbreaking loss to Arizona, it was essential for the Trojans to show the ability to bounce back while under scrutiny from fans and media alike.
Entering Saturday, USC was just 6-5 in games following a loss under Kiffin.
“It would have been very difficult to go back to the kids and tell them to practice if we lost again,” Kiffin admitted.
Given that the announced crowd at the Coliseum was 62,006, the smallest of the Kiffin era, it’s fair to say it would have been just as hard to convince fans to come back for the team’s game against Utah State this Saturday.
But instead of another disappointing defeat, which would have been disastrous, the team turned in its first truly inspired performance since last November’s 38-17 victory over Arizona State, which feels eons ago at this point.
From the first play, on a long pass ordered straight from USC President C. L. Max Nikias himself, the Trojans engaged the crowd and set to rest any thought that they’d roll over to a lesser opponent for the second straight week.
“It was a thing we took personal,” redshirt sophomore Cody Kessler said of the dismal performance against Washington State. “Personally, for the offense, it can be tough to bounce back from a game like that.
But the Trojans made it look easy.
Kessler finally showed the public the potential he flashed in fall camp, passing for 237 yards and two touchdowns while only recording two incompletions. Kessler’s 174 passing yards in the first half surpassed his career total (145).
USC’s co-starters at tailback, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis, racked up 198 rushing yards, keeping injured senior Silas Redd off the minds of the Trojan faithful.
USC’s total offensive output (521 yards) was the most the team has gained since piling up 615 in a 63-52 loss to Oregon last season.
And somehow, the defense topped itself after two outstanding weeks to kick off the 2013 campaign.
Even though the Trojans didn’t force any turnovers and only recorded one sack, USC held the Eagles to 184 total yards, the fewest allowed by the Trojans since 2009, when Pete Carroll was still patrolling the sidelines.
Boston College tailback Andre Williams was the nation’s third leading rusher coming into the game, but the Trojans held him to 38 yards on 17 carries. That completely handicapped the Eagles offense, which thrives on establishing the run game to set up play-action passes for quarterback Chase Rettig.
Simply put, it was just what USC needed after a dreadful Week 2.
It’s unclear how the Trojans will play against Utah State, which figures to be USC’s toughest nonconference opponent yet.
But it’s doubtful the mood around Howard Jones Field will resemble last week’s gloomy aura. And for a team — and coach — that’s already faced its fair share of second-guessing by pundits this season, that will surely be a welcome respite.

Through USC’s first two games, one thing has been clear: No matter how poorly the offense plays, the defense can be dominant enough keep the team in the game.
Breaking free · Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee (9) provided the Trojans’ with their longest offensive play of the season in the second quarter when he shook off a defender en route to an 80-yard touchdown romp. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
On Saturday against Boston College, the Trojan defense again delivered, but this time the offense finally broke through. Instead of finding itself in a close game, USC enjoyed a 35-7 blowout victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“The energy on the sideline was awesome today,” redshirt junior defensive back Josh Shaw said. “It’s great knowing your offense is moving the ball. The best place for a defensive player to be is on the sidelines.”
After struggling mightily in its first two games, particularly in the loss to Washington State, the USC offense erupted on Saturday, racking up 521 yards of total offense, including 264 passing yards, a drastic improvement from last week’s woeful 54-yard performance against the Cougars.
On defense, the Trojans again were stout, allowing only 184 total yards to the Eagles. Boston College running back Andre Williams, who averaged 160 yards per game entering this week, was held to just 38 yards on 17 carries.
“We were number one worried about their running back,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “We hadn’t played against a power-I offense yet. It’s very much a Stanford-like offense. Our guys really tackled well.”
Through three games, USC has allowed 131 total rushing yards and just one rushing touchdown, which came late in the game Saturday when the Trojans had most of their second-team defense on the field.
COMFORT ZONE
After being named the team’s starter for the remainder of the season, redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler seemed more relaxed and played with a confidence level that he did not have in the team’s first two games.
“The first two weeks, and I’m not making excuses, but you can’t really take control and be that guy to lead when you’re sharing reps,” Kessler said. “I had a whole new sense of confidence [this week]. Coach Kiffin has been talking to me all week and trusting me. I felt comfortable and relaxed, and I had a blast doing it.”
Kessler finished the day with 15 completions on 17 pass attempts for 237 yards and two touchdowns and did not have a single turnover. Entering the week as the starter, his newfound confidence was apparent to the entire team.
“Cody came out and had a great week of practice,” redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden said. “You could just see it in his eyes, the energy he brought to the offense.”
“Just having that quarterback in there and working with him the whole week, not having to guess which quarterback is gonna be in, it really helped,” redshirt senior offensive tackle Kevin Graf said. “It definitely gave him a lot of confidence. He seemed a lot more relaxed today and really led us very well.”
friendly confines
Considering the ineffectiveness of the passing game against Washington State, fans’ expectations for Saturday were understandably low. But after throwing a deep pass that fell incomplete on the first play of the game, the crowd’s reaction caught many off guard.
“[The crowd cheering] was surprising,” junior wide receiver Marqise Lee said. “But then again, I know what they were cheering about. The fact that we were taking shots downfield, that’s all they wanted to see.”
Kiffin’s conservative playcalling against Washington State had been criticized all week, so seeing USC take a chance on a deep pass was an encouraging sign to many.
“That was [President C.L.] Max Nikias’ play,” Kiffin said of the game’s first play. “He said throw deep, and they’ll cheer no matter what. So that was for President Nikias.”
With all the negativity from the fans following last week’s loss, Kiffin was encouraged by the fans’ reaction to the team’s play.
“I felt like there was an effort by the fans,” Kiffin said. “We felt they came out today saying they were really going to support this team. I felt it on the Trojan Walk and down on the field. That just shows how special our fans are.”
“It wasn’t an easy week on our fans, with how passionate they are and what they had to deal with last week,” Kiffin said. “I’m happy for them to feel good today. We had good Trojan football for the most part today.”
ONE-TWO PUNCH
For the first time since 1981, a USC running back has opened the season with three consecutive 100-yard games. Madden finished the game with 102 yards on 16 carries and one rushing touchdown, and also had two catches for 32 yards and a touchdown.
That accomplishment is impressive in and of itself, but even more so when considering Madden has played only three collegiate games at running back.
“I’m definitely getting more comfortable as the weeks go by,” Madden said. “Everything is slowing down more as the season goes on.”
Joining Madden in pacing USC’s rushing attack is freshman tailback Justin Davis, who finished the game with 96 yards on just 10 carries and one touchdown. After rushing the ball 32 times against Washington State, Madden was relieved to split carries more evenly against Boston College.
“[Davis] is a great running back,” Madden said. “In splitting our carries, we were fresh today. That definitely helped us out.”
Davis, who enrolled in school early and participated in spring practice, had his first taste of success in front of the home fans, but believes he can still do more to impress them.
“Not really yet,” Davis said when asked if he felt he had a breakout game. “I’m planning on improving every game. I’m never satisfied with a performance, so I’m gonna try to top every performance the next game.”
QUOTE WORTHY
“The thing about the fans is, it’s USC — they’re used to winning,” Lee said. “I can’t blame them if they’re booing because we lose, because around here, winning is all they know. Once we bring that winning back, the fans, they’re gonna love it.”
Lee is partially correct.  Winning is ultimately what USC football is all about.  What he failed to stress is that the fan base will be there if they can see that the team is motivated…that it visibly wants to win.  When they see people not playing with obvious pride, with movement and interest, then support vanishes.  Of course, the Kiffin statue comes with the coach, but it still amazes me that the coach, who is supposed to be a teacher, had to be led by his President and the boos of the fans into learning the most obvious teaching lesson of all…you have to let the kids play the game.  Discipline, yes, but fun, too.  Kiffin’s lack of imagination, his incredible inability to make a decision, and blaming the quarterbacks for HIS lack of leadership may continue but I am hoping that the kids have taught the teacher what a game is really all about and that a team that plays with pride will bring the fans with them.
Marquise Lee is partially correct.  Winning IS what playing the game is ultimately about.  But it is also about how a team plays.  Do they go about it like it’s a day-job?  Do they stand on the sidelines as silent observers?  Are they on the field just because it’s their turn to be there?  Or do they play with passion, with motivation, with pride?  El Paso was a disaster on every level, as evidenced by that living-dead coach and those poor, frozen players on the sidelines, just standing there.  Hawaii and Washington were much the same.  And has Kiffin said a thing about his inability to choose a leader, a quarterback?  His crummy, unimaginative play-calling?  No.  It was always the inability of the quarterbacks.  Did he ever get out of his anal-retentive growth phase until the fans booed him off the field?  And now, it was the President of the University who booted him in the butt to teach him the most obvious lesson in teaching kids: “let ’em play, coach, let ’em play and they will teach YOU how to play a game”….  OK, guys, great discipline, great forbearance, well done.  Now, please, win or lose, give ’em hell…with no penalties!

Manuel Castells, a professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, was recently chosen as one of four recipients of the 2013 Balzan Prize for Sociology. He was awarded a prize of 750,000 Swiss francs, or approximately $800,000.

Castells said he was surprised to receive the prize since it is rare for people to win the prize for their work in sociology. The Balzan Prize is unique because half of the money awarded to Castells must be dedicated to research conducted by young researchers.
Founded in 1957, the Balzan Foundation aims to “promote culture, the sciences and the most meritorious initiatives in the cause of humanity, peace and fraternity among peoples throughout the world,” according to its website.
“[Castells was chosen] for his wide-ranging and imaginative thinking through the implications of the great technological changes of our time: the digital revolution and the profound social and political challenges brought about by the emerging technologies of communication and information processing associated with computing, microelectronics and the Internet. And for having proposed a general theory of the new global information society that has arisen out of these techniques,” according to a press release from the foundation.
Castells is also the recipient of a multitude of other awards, including the Holberg International Memorial Prize, which is awarded to one person a year for outstanding work in social sciences, law, theology and arts and humanities. He has written 26 books and is the editor or co-author of 22 others. In addition, he has written more than 100 articles in various academic journals.
On Nov. 14, the Balzan Prize recipients will present their research. This year’s ceremony for the winners will take place in Berne, Switzerland on Nov. 15.  On campus, Castells will be hosting an event for USC students and faculty titled the Moral Crisis of China on Sept. 16.

Many USC students have started to mentor high school students through the upcoming nonprofit program, CollegeSpring. A 5-year-old nonprofit designed to offer free SAT prep and college counseling to underserved high school juniors, CollegeSpring was created in order to combat low graduation rates and help students from low-income areas go to college.
On average, students who go through the CollegeSpring program for SAT preparation, usually as part of their school curriculum, increased their test scores by 188 points, which is on par with for-profit test prep companies such as Kaplan and Princeton Review.
CollegeSpring works with various high schools in the greater Los Angeles area, as well as the San Francisco Bay Area, to help students realize their full potential by working with them to boost their SAT scores and to understand the college admission process. Students enrolled in the program attend a general SAT class about three times a week. In addition to classes, students also meet with college-aged mentors in small groups once a week for about an hour to practice for the test.
Having recently secured a partnership with Teach for America, CollegeSpring hopes to expand both organizations and become more well-known throughout the community, especially among USC undergraduates.
“A lot of people who did CollegeSpring and mentored as undergrads were interested in Teach for America because they are really similar,” Melina Charis, a senior majoring in creative writing and a current mentor for CollegeSpring, said. “It seemed like a kind of natural step for CollegeSpring.”
Though they each do different things, CollegeSpring and Teach for America are similar in that they are both interested in helping students from low-income communities do better in school in an attempt to raise their scores so that they will be able to have the opportunity to go to college.  Many of CollegeSpring’s mentors also plan on working for Teach for America after graduating from college.
“Right now, we’re trying to meet with the Teach for America recruiter to do joint information sessions to get people who are interested in Teach for America interested in CollegeSpring or vice versa,” Charis said.
CollegeSpring hopes that by working with Teach for America, they will be able to get the word out about CollegeSpring.
“Teach for America is really good at recruiting and because of that, they are able to be a lot more selective,” Charis said.
CollegeSpring has worked with approximately 5,000 students and aims to work with many more in the future.
“CollegeSpring is growing really, really fast, and it has a lot of similarities to [Teach for America],” Charis said. “The goal with the partnership is just to expand both organizations.”
Nancy Aguilar, a high school senior from Animo Inglewood Charter High School, found the program to be important to her development as a prospective college student.
“What helped me was that the people who were in my group were struggling with the same things I did,” Aguilar said. “It made it much easier for me to take advantage of [CollegeSpring].”
USC students found the program to be rewarding as well.
“USC does a lot of things within the community to help kids from local schools,” said Kiersten Stanley, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “I thought that CollegeSpring was another good way to help kids that are not necessarily affiliated with USC but is still promoting the same message of educating our community.”

Though Los Angeles traffic is often inevitable, results from a Keck School of Medicine of USC study released last week show that drivers have some control over their exposure to road particle pollution based on their choice of car ventilation settings.
Environmental health researchers Scott Fruin, assistant professor of preventative medicine, and Neelakshi Hudda, research associate in environmental health, conducted the first study of its kind on in-vehicle exposure including a full range of car types, operating conditions and all types of on-road particulate pollution.
“In our study we found that a simple step, setting car ventilation to recirculate, reduces exposure to vehicle related particulate pollution by 70 to 80 percent,” said Fruin, the senior author of the study.
Researchers said the study, which was published in Environmental Science & Technology, is the most comprehensive study of its kind.
“Until this comprehensive study, measurements have been based on only a few cars and usually only one pollutant,” Hudda said in a press release. “We showed that recirculation settings produce large exposure reductions across all car types and for all particulate pollutants.”
Fruin and Hudda said the findings of their study can help people decrease their risk of the negative health effects resulting from traffic-related particulate pollution. Some of these risks include premature mortality, heart disease and cancer.
“When driving, right off the bat you are in an unhealthy environment because you’re so close to vehicle emissions, but if you are in that situation, especially with long commutes, taking this simple step can reduce exposure,” Fruin said.
The study also revealed that exposure levels are lower in newer cars driving at slower speeds on major roads.
Talia Moradkhanian, a junior majoring in sociology, found these findings interesting as a commuter student who spends up to an hour and 20 minutes in traffic each day when she drives from her home in Glendale to the USC campus.
“It’s our health so we should care. Campus should definitely promote the results of the study because if it’s something so easy to do, why not?” Mordkhanian said.
Michelle Garcia, USC’s associate director of transit, said that the USC Transportation office would consider posting the results of the study on its  Facebook page, in addition to evaluating whether its buses can utilize the recirculation setting on their vents.
Some students said they would appreciate efforts to publicize this information.
“Living in L.A. in general, air pollution is something I think about. It would be so easy and helpful to just put signs in the parking lots reminding students to adjust their vent settings,” said Elizabeth Fisher, a junior majoring in communication.
The best way to reduce exposure to these pollutants, Fruin said, is to drive less or utilize public transportation whenever possible.
According to Garcia, the USC Transportation office recognizes the importance of public transportation and encourages students to utilize their  programs.
“We organize carpools, vanpools and offer discounts on permits for carpooling,” Garcia said. “We also have a program for the Metro where students can get passes at our office instead of going to the Metro site.”
Katherine Strashnov, a junior majoring in communication, uses the Expo Line in order to get to her job in Culver City
“I’ve only seen one other USC student commuting on the Expo Line before. It’s easy for where I work but I know a lot of people don’t take it because it’s harder [to get places] once you get further into L.A.,” Strashnov said.
Fruin recognizes the challenge of using public transportation in Los Angeles, but said people who read his study and understand the negative environmental and health effects of driving should try to utilize public transit as much as possible.
After completing the study, Fruin hopes to use its momentum to receive funding for a new project, which would investigate the health effects of commuting.

This past January, the USC Dept. of Public Safety installed 14 new license plate recognition cameras on and around campus. Since then, the cameras have gotten more than 500 hits, reporting license plates of  lost or stolen cars that are wanted in connection with a crime.
Big brother · A camera watches over Gate 5 on Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue. DPS has installed 14 new license plate recognition cameras on campus and in the surrounding area since January. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The cameras were installed as part of a multi-million dollar effort to enhance campus security measures. The new cameras work in tandem with 48 license plate readers that were installed in 2011 and 111 video patrol cameras, the first of which were installed in 2006.
“We strategically place them in the neighborhoods, and we also have them at every entrance to campus, so no car, theoretically, can come on or off campus without having their license plate scanned,” DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said.
The cameras scan every license plate that passes by them and run the numbers through a Department of Justice database, which determines if the license plate has been reported for any reason.
USC is one of few college campuses to use this technology. In a 2012 article from The New York Times, the University of Miami said they were considering adding license recognition cameras system, and an NBC affiliate in Wisconsin recently reported that police at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay have begun testing the system with plans to implement it at the start of the 2014 school year.
Carlisle said the cameras are part of USC’s multilayered approach to campus safety that combines the use of DPS officers, private security and LAPD officers with technology to help keep students safe.
“We’re trying to minimize any spaces surrounding campus or on campus where a criminal could go without expecting to see law enforcement or be under the surveillance of law enforcement,” Carlisle said.
Through its partnership with USC, the LAPD has been able to make 36 LPR-related arrests since the original installation of the cameras in 2011, according to Carlisle.
Paul Snell, Captain of the LAPD Southwest Division, said the department’s partnership with USC has been extremely beneficial. He pointed to a recent case where a USC student left a party, got into a car with some men and was raped.
“The cameras themselves were useful in allowing us to identify who the suspects were and subsequently take them into custody for a rape investigation,” Snell said. “If we didn’t have that type of technology around campus we wouldn’t be able to make arrests or conduct these thorough investigations.”
USC’s resources often exceed those of municipal agencies. LAPD Southwest Division has four working LPR cameras that operate in police vehicles, scanning license plates as officers drive, but the division relies on USC to monitor the cameras surrounding campus and alert the LAPD of incidents. DPS has a communications office where officers are specifically trained to monitor a 72-screen unit that displays feeds from video patrol cameras and LPR cameras.
DPS Chief John Thomas credits predecessor Chief Carey Drayton for pushing to install the cameras.
“People that have been arrested as a result of the LPR and  cameras have been people that have committed crimes away from the USC area,” Thomas said.
Junior mechanical engineering major Hannah Wilensky said that she and many other students were not aware of the LPR cameras but believes that they’re worth the cost as long as they remain useful.
“DPS does so much that we’re not aware of,” Wilensky said. “They have them there for a reason and they’re really effective. At the same time, if DPS makes [the information] public and [the cameras] start not becoming useful then I would worry.”
Still, freshman broadcast and digital journalism major Mirian Fuentes is concerned that the measures don’t have enough of a direct effect on students.
“It’s helpful but not enough to outweigh the cost,” Fuentes said.
Carlisle said that though students might not directly be aware of the direct benefits of the security measures, the hope is that criminals will become aware of security measures on campus and choose to go elsewhere.
Snell said he wishes the LAPD could be as well-equipped as USC but the partnership remains essential for the safety of the city as a whole.
“Technology is here and I think people are getting more and more used to it,” Snell said. “The importance that it brings to not only USC but to the Southwest Division in working together to solve crimes is huge.”
Seems a great idea
Who says we don’t.

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Charles Colton, a writer as old as the earth and as dead as mixtapes, quipped this fantastic little line way back in the day. But this quote doesn’t just apply to the girl in your film class who decided to purchase the exact same shoes after seeing you wear them.
It applies to music, too. After all, disc jockeys around the world make a living enhancing familiar sounds with their own flair.
USC students unfamiliar with the mash-up and remix scenes received a taste of this exciting world back in fall 2012, when Program Board and Undergraduate Student Government brought the ingenious DJ duo, The White Panda, to campus.
The following playlist features an eccentric collection of artists who have stripped down or jazzed up the work of others. If you’re looking to change things up in life this week, enjoy this collection. Headphones are recommended to fully enjoy the experience.
1.  “Diggin’ Ray Charles” by MashMike
DJ MashMike, hailing from Germany, boasts a SoundCloud profile stocked with wacky mixes of the greatest hits. In this selection, he combines the catchy vocals of Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” with the unorthodox Chiddy Bang number, “Ray Charles.” MashMike’s version stays pretty true to the original, save the beats. So you can still sing along to this mash-up without being caught off-guard.

2. “6 Foot 7 Foot” by J-Trick 
Forget Lil Wayne’s verses. By simply sampling the “six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot, bunch” hook from the Carter IV album, Australian DJ J-Trick makes this track killer. The unbelievable bass and skillful use of the synthesizer, electronic music’s manna, gives “6 foot 7 foot” a complete face-lift.

3. “Clarity” by Aylen
Unlike J-Trick, Aylen is not as prominent in the electronic world. But Zedd’s song, “Clarity,” is definitely no stranger to ’SC. You’ve heard this song so much that you can sing it in your sleep — and most likely have done so already. Electronic producer Aylen’s version leaves listeners with a far more euphoric feeling due to its faster tempo and imaginative background beats. If Aylen keeps this game up, we’ll certainly see more of him around town.

4. “Royals” by Ross Horkings
Some songs are so good you never want to see the word “remix” next to them. The thought of some weird-looking dude butchering your favorite anthem is simply unacceptable. But Ross Horkings is neither a weird-looking dude nor a man who has butchered an international favorite. In fact, he serves up an irresistibly caffeinated account of Lorde’s popular single. Though radically different from the original, Horkings’ adaptation does justice to Lorde’s talent.

5. “Firefly” by The White Panda
“Firefly” is arguably the most mind-blowing mash-up on The White Panda’s most recent album, Bearly Legal. The intelligent minds behind The White Panda, Dan Griffith and Tom Evans, have seamlessly blended four hits: Ellie Goulding’s “Anything Could Happen,” A$AP Rocky ft. Kendrick Lamar’s “F*ckin’ Problems,” Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Snow (Hey Oh)” and The Lumineers’ “Ho Hey.”

6. “Fix You” by Aylen
Electronic producer Aylen is so good he gets a double feature — this version of U.K. band Coldplay’s popular song, “Fix You,” his addictive sounds breathe fresh air into a rather melancholic song. Some electronic enthusiasts describe similar renderings as “chillstep,” a musical genre likened to dubstep but with slower, calming tones and heavy bass. For the latter portion of this playlist, we’ll explore less fast-paced choices, so you can put away your dancing shoes for now.

7. “Concrete Wall” by RAC
Remix artists from around the globe make up RAC, which stands for Remix Artist Collective. Their most popular productions have altered the sounds of artists such as The Temper Trap and Lana Del Rey. In this lesser-known selection, they’ve injected a funky and synthetic feel into Malaysian artist Zee Avi’s tender voice.

8. “Atlas Hands” by Kashii
For this song, headphones aren’t just advised, they’re required. Benjamin Francis Leftwich, an artist from York, England, possesses a spellbinding voice — airy, yet dynamic. British DJ Kashii has carefully remixed Leftwich’s most popular song, “Atlas Hands,” to produce an equally entrancing edition.
If you enjoy this version of “Atlas Hands,” I also highly recommend the Karma Kid remix. Karma Kid’s version barely resembles original, but the innovation makes it a keeper.

9. “Old Pine” by Peking Duk
Remixing acoustic or folk music requires serious talent. After all, how can you take a song meant for enjoyment while lounging lakeside and turn it into a club-worthy track without irking a few hipsters? Somehow, Australian DJ duo, Peking Duk, took the mesmerizing voice of Ben Howard and transformed his song, “Old Pine,” into a radical work of art. Peking Duk sampled Ben Howard’s melodious voice for their intro, but just wait for the beat drop 10 seconds in. The song assumes an entirely different character and instead of objecting to the change, you’ll embrace it.

The USC Fisher Museum of Art’s current exhibit, “Drawn to Language,” blurs the intersection between language and art. This mixed media exhibition, which opened Sept. 3 and runs until Dec. 7, explores the relationships each artist has to language. Ranging from literal to textual to more symbolic depictions, “Drawn to Language” makes viewers question the power of words and the role they play in shaping art.
Say what? · Artist Alexandra Grant plays with the concept of self image in her piece “Century of the Self.” The piece creates the effect of words as they would be said before a mirror by employing the effect on hand-painted words. “Drawn to Language” runs at Fisher Museum until Dec. 3. – Courtesy of Brian Forrest
Upon entering, viewers are greeted with Kate Ingold’s “Thesaurus for Ceasing War” and “21st Century Retablo” series. The most striking piece in Ingold’s “Thesaurus” is the embroidered silk photographic panels. The photographs of a building in the process of construction are interlaced with metallic threads. An original poem accompanies the panels. The muted palette of the work adds to its ephemerality and suggests the intangibility of language. Ingold’s other pieces echo similar themes, featuring original poetry and photographs interlaced with metallic threads. While its ties to language are not overt, “Thesaurus for Ceasing War” sends a powerful message about how words can be used to promote nonviolence.
“21st Century Retablo” mirrors Ingold’s other work and depicts the 2005 apparition of the Lady Guadalupe beneath a bridge in Chicago. The term “retablo” refers to offerings or requests made to Christian saints. This raises the question of the language of faith and how people feel words (i.e., prayer) connect them to deities.
Demián Flores and Lila Downs’ collaboration on “Pecados y Milagros (Sins and Miracles)” also addresses the connections between language and religion. This project invited contemporary artists to create traditional Mexican votive candles, which feature images and prayers. In addition to the contemporary pieces, the Fisher Museum also displays traditional votivos for comparison. The “Pecados y Milagros” collection delves further into the realm of language with Lila Downs’ album by the same title. Similarly to the contemporary votivos, the album explores themes of tradition and language. This multifaceted approach to language makes “Pecados y Milagros” one of the most intriguing collections on display.
In the adjacent room, Holly Downing and David St. John’s “Peruvian Portals, A Cross-Cultural Hymn,” reflects ancient tradition and modern language. A 2006 trip to the Andes inspired Downing to create mezzotint engravings of the doorways and archways she encountered. St. John was drawn to Peruvian culture after reading poems translated from the ancient language, Quechua. The exhibition has an audio component, which allows patrons to hear one of St. John’s poems, “Doorway Song,” spoken in Quechua. Like “Pecados y Milagros,” this collection uses different languages to express the same idea — making viewers reflect on the superficiality of language barriers. Additionally, St. John will present his poetry live on Wednesday, Oct. 23 at Fisher. “The Peruvian Portals” collaboration matches images with poems and was published as a book by the same title.
Books can be thought of as the epitome of collected language; they weave complex stories but can also be art in themselves. Artist Susan Silton crafts a collection that revolves around the physical aspects of language. Her installation, “In Everything There Is a Trace,” uses ribbon-less typewriters to impress text onto pages. The focal point of the collection is a site-specific installation of 10 typewriters arranged in a circle. Visitors can sign up to participate in the ribbon-less retyping of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath on select Fridays at the museum. Instead of setting traditional type on the paper, the pages will bear subtle impressions of the text. Silton’s collection also includes catalog pages impressed with poems and mounted in movable wall frames. These pieces serve as a reminder that before the age of the computer, word processing involved more effort and left physical rather than just visual traces on the page. Silton’s collection encapsulates the essence of the “Drawn to Language” exhibition. With its clear focus and coherent yet creative execution, “In Everything There Is a Trace” prompts viewers to reimagine the way language is recorded.
Artist Alexandra Grant draws on similar themes of literature and texture in “Century of the Self.” Grant explores the connection between language and self-definition by quoting lines from literary classics such as Sophocles’ Antigone and Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Grant incorporates these phrases in large, colorful paintings and plays with mirror images and reflection. Her wall pieces seem reminiscent of street art and hint at the ubiquity of famous literary phrases. In continuing with her exploration of the self, Grant uses colorful pieces of recycled plastic to create a Rorschach inkblot test (a psychological test that observes participant’s interpretation of inkblot patterns) on the museum floor. Similar to Silton’s site-specific installation, this piece invites viewer interaction. Grant will present her work at the museum on Oct. 20. Grant’s work has the least concrete ties to language, yet “Century of the Self” still contributes to the exhibition as a whole by adding kaleidoscopic colors and unexpected texture.
“Drawn to Language” addresses the ways in which artists connect with language — it shows that words have the ability to move beyond the page. Fisher presents many opportunities for multimedia engagement with language through a series of related events. For the duration of the event, Fisher will host concerts, artist talks and poetry readings to add another facet to the exhibit. These multimedia events all center on language but allow visitors to step away from the page and consider words in different contexts.
 
“Drawn to Language” official opening will take place on Thursday, Sept. 26 and will include a speech by the museum director, as well as a chance to meet some of the artists.

Once upon a time, roughly 11 years ago, a 16-year-old named Sarah J. Maas re-imagined the story of Cinderella. Rather than sending Cinderella to the ball to dance with the prince, she made her Cinderella an assassin sent to kill him. Maas turned the idea into a trilogy called Queen of Glass, which she published on an online fiction website called FictionPress.com. The retelling became one of the most popular stories on the site. In 2008, Maas made the decision to take the story down and try to publish it through traditional means.
Throne of Maas · Author Sarah J. Maas’ Crown of Midnight debuted at No. 5 of The New York Times’ bestseller list for Young Adult Fiction. – Courtesy of Bailando entro Libros
The story went offline, but Maas stayed on, updating her fans on her LiveJournal, giving them an in-depth look at her journey to be published. Four years and countless revisions later, Throne of Glass, the first part of Maas’ saga, was published by Bloomsbury. The second book in the series, Crown of Midnight, was released this month. Currently, the book rests comfortably on The New York Times Young Adult bestseller list at No. 9.
In some ways, Maas’ writing methods speaks to the new ways the Internet is making writers think about and write fiction. Used to instant feedback from publishing stories chapter by chapter online, Maas utilizes critique partners to review her work as she is writing. She is also in the process of co-writing a story on Tumblr called The Starkillers Cycle with critique partner and author of Something Strange and Deadly, Susan Dennard.
“We both like writing stuff together and we came up with this story that doesn’t fit easily into any boxes and might not work well in book form, but would be perfect for a FictionPress-style serialized story, so, we went back to our roots,” Maas said.
Perhaps because Maas started writing online, she doesn’t feel as tied to the traditional format and is more willing to experiment within the genre. For example, she recently sold a fantasy trilogy under the label of New Adult. For those unfamiliar with the category, that’s because it’s new enough that Maas feels unqualified to define it in her own words. She finds this definition interesting, though: “Young Adult is figuring out your place in the world and how you fit into it, and New Adult is once you’ve found your place in the world, what you do next.”
Maas is among a wave of Young Adult authors who have been influenced by the Internet. Lauren Donovan, a senior publicist at Random House Children’s Books, said she personally has observed a trend toward more authors getting their start online.
“As technology progresses, there is a new wave of opportunities for writers,” Donovan said. “I think we’ll see this happening more and more often, that people will put their work out there and get noticed.”
Maas wants to continue to utilize the internet to help other writers. One of the founders of Pub(lishing) Crawl, an online resource for authors and aspiring authors, she and other contributors who are agents, editors and publishers, discuss the general ins and outs of the business.
Alexandra Bracken, author of Brightly Woven and The Darkest Minds, writes an “Ask Alex” advice column on the site. Like Maas, Bracken got her start writing fan fiction (of the Star Wars variety). In her column, she tries to help give readers a balanced overview of what it’s really like to work in the publishing industry.
“I really enjoy writing posts for PubCrawl because it really is a conversation rather than just putting words out there in the universe,” Bracken said. “And it’s rewarding to pay it forward; we’re talking about the things we all wish we had known when starting out.”
Pay it forward: in a way, that is what drives all of Pub(lishing) Crawl’s contributors, especially Maas.
“I’m a big believer in paying it forward,” Maas said. “I got where I am today because one of my FictionPress readers emailed me out of the blue in like 2008, right after I pulled Queen of Glass off FictionPress.”
The email, from Prada & Prejudice author Mandy Hubbard, offered to help Maas get her book published.
“Without that kindness I never would have had what I have today, so it kind of instilled in me the sense of wanting to do that whenever I can,” Maas said.
Now on her second book tour, Maas is excited to introduce her sophomore novel to the world.
“I worked really hard on Throne of Glass, but this book, Crown of Midnight, I poured everything into it,” Maas said.
Once shy about public speaking (“Until last year, the thought of public speaking scared the crap out of me”), she has learned to embrace it. “I kind of had to sink or swim. I like talking to people now because it’s about something that I love.”
Crown of Midnight stays true to the original feel of Maas’ online story, but gives a more mature feel to the world of Cinderella-esque Celaena Sardothien, an assassin-turned-slave who now serves as the King’s champion.
“I wrote this as I grew up,” Maas said. “Now that I’m somewhat of an adult, I can look at this story with a different perspective and make it stronger, like take the strongest bits of the FictionPress version and transform them into the better version of themselves.”
Though Maas said there were a few fixed points from her original story that she wanted to keep, much of Celaena’s narrative was free game. For example, a recurring quote that was featured heavily in the online version was taken out, in favor of a catchphrase that Maas relates to more: “I will not be afraid.”
“It’s something that I wind up saying to myself when I get nervous, especially during my debut year when everything was so new,” Maas said. “Telling myself back then, ‘I will not be afraid’ — it was this thing that helped me center myself, and those reminders sometimes really help.”
Maas introduced the quote in one of Celaena’s five novellas, which were released during the time between the end of the edits for Throne of Glass and the actual publication date. The idea for the novellas came in order to give fans something as they waited for the book to come out.
“I felt awful saying: ‘OK, you guys need to wait another six months for the story,’ so we thought it would be a way to make fans excited again, and also to thank them for their support and maybe introduce some new readers to the series before the books came out,” Maas said.
Writing the novellas also allowed Maas new avenues through which to explore Celaena’s character.
“I’ve been writing Celaena for 11 years now. I know her character to the point where I trust my gut when it comes to writing the story, and if she’s telling me to go in another direction — even if I planned something else — I’ll listen to her,” Maas said. “Getting that chance to walk through a very dark period of her past with her really made me get a lot of stuff about her. I wound up changing a lot of my vision for the rest of the series because of what she went through.”
Maas said she feels blessed to be in the position today to do what she loves: write.
“When I was in, like, middle school and high school, the Young Adult genre was not nearly as big, and I outgrew it because I read pretty much everything that was on the shelves,” Maas said. “I think Young Adult now, thanks to The Hunger Games, Twilight, Harry Potter … all of these paved the way and made all the awesome stuff I’m doing possible, so I got very lucky.”
Despite her modest explanation, Maas’ journey to get Throne of Glass published took a lot more than simple luck. Now a New York Times bestselling author, Maas has come a long way since posting an early draft of Celaena’s story on Fictionpress. And, in order to get where she is today, she has had to trust in her character’s motto: not to be afraid, in order to achieve her very own happily ever after.

No one was really surprised when news broke last May that two major universities offered teaching positions to retired Gen. David Petraeus. After all, this country is familiar by now with prominent people never facing the consequences of their actions. Petraeus’ very public fall was obviously not a factor in City University of New York and University of Southern California’s hiring decisions when they decided to link their good names to a disgraced man. The sex scandal that ousted him also did not put a dent in CUNY’s initial salary offer of $200,000 — highlighting the inconvenient reality that the powerful political elites are held to vastly different standards and operate under vastly different rules than the rest of us.
It could be argued that USC is potentially sullying its good name by associating itself with Petraeus, but this is an institution of learning where the free flow of ideas is the guiding principle. For those students harboring strong opinions about Petraeus, it is a simple matter of not registering for the classes he will be teaching.
But then again, Petraeus is now the faculty adviser to the USC Veterans Association. Petraeus greatly expanded President Barack Obama’s brutal drone regime as head of the Central Intelligence Agency. According to the Washington Post, Petraeus sought permission to use “signature strikes” in Yemen. Signature strikes are attacks carried out by our government against groups of people, often unidentifiable due to limited intelligence, based on patterns of behavior. Something that looked like a terrorist meeting could very well be a terrorist meeting, or it could be a simple wedding filled with innocent people including women and children.
It is doubly disturbing that this is the same man under whose leadership oversaw the bloodiest years on record in terms of American military casualties in Afghanistan. According to figures released by the Department of Defense, nearly 40 percent of the American deaths in the duration of the Afghanistan War occurred under Petraeus’ watch. Petraeus does not advocate for veterans, as he has evidently had a history of failing those in the armed forces.
Lt. Col. John Cook, a former Army intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, put it much more succinctly  when he told the Daily Beast, “Petraeus made a mess of things in this war. That’s the real scandal.” According to Cook, Petraeus wrote a counterinsurgency strategy that “places a higher value on the lives of Afghan civilians than the lives of our own soldiers, many of whom have died unnecessarily” because of Petraeus’ leadership. It is a scandal that so many veterans had to suffer under Petraeus’ leadership, a sentiment shared by Ian Daily, president of the Young Americans for Liberty at the University of Southern California and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran. He told the Daily Trojan, “He was so political and out-of-touch, and so far disconnected from the men and women who had to carry out his orders in Afghanistan. And now he wants to advise veterans?”
What makes Petraeus think he can be a capable advisor to USC’s young men and women, including its veterans? Petraeus was the wrong choice to lead the Afghanistan War, the wrong choice to lead the nation’s top intelligence agency and the wrong choice as advisor for the USC Veterans Association. If Petraeus could not even keep soldiers alive, he surely cannot act as a mentor to them.

To suggest that Petraeus is unfit to teach here based on the author’s opinion of his political philosophy or military decisions is simply stupid. Furthermore, the logic itself is flawed: the author claims Petraeus has not served veterans by not protecting them from fighting:
“It is doubly disturbing that this is the same man under whose leadership oversaw the bloodiest years on record in terms of American military casualties in Afghanistan. According to figures released by the Department of Defense, nearly 40 percent of the American deaths in the duration of the Afghanistan War occurred under Petraeus’ watch. Petraeus does not advocate for veterans, as he has evidently had a history of failing those in the armed forces.”
Yet, the author also berates Petraeus for advocating for drone strikes and signature strikes, both of which REDUCE military casualties. 
I would also add this: while I am not a veteran, in the midst of this dispute, we should not forget the bravery and sacrifice of our troops – both veterans and those abroad.
Really?
You know who’s unfit for duty? Barack Hussein Obama II, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, That fool who’s now Sec State a traitor from the Viet Nam era, like Jane Fonda.  Pick your battles wisely young man/woman, whoever you are…… You don’t know anything about what’s happening politically in this world if you’re under 35 y/o.  If you’re older than that, you should be ashamed of yourself for not knowing better.
I do not doubt the sincerity of your beliefs katman as to the short comings of the individuals to which you refer.  I am not taking a position on the relative merits of them or Petraeus, and not because I am ill-informed which I assure you I am not, my age notwithstanding.  My point is that in order to reach a well reasoned, articulate and substantiated conclusion regarding Petraeus’s role as an advisor to veterans at USC, his entire career, personal foibles and reputation among the veterans he has been appointed to advise need to be weighed .  Categorical assertions about him or those you have called out as being unworthy of fair assessment are the metaphorical equivalent of covering one’s ears and stomping one’s feet.  I just don’t find that terribly persuasive.
Petraeus is a public figure and his accomplishments and failures are fair game just as the decision to hire him is fair game.  It would be a much more worthwhile endeavor to stay on point about what those accomplishments and failures are than to deflect that focus by raising extraneous issues such as the relative merits of other leaders, their respective levels of testosterone notwithstanding.
My apologies. It seems there’s a lag between when the page renders and when the comments show up.
So now the DP is censoring comments when these comments are contrary to the writer’s opinion? I submitted a quite lengthy rebuttal to this writer’s opinion about the general, and my reply is not listed. Hmm.
If the author really believes that the general is guilty of incompetence and murder, then why arern’t you calling for the head of president Obama, who fired the previous general, who was doing a fantastic job, McChrystal I believe. Since you are a vet, you know full well and especially under the current administration that Obama and his Sec Def and Sec State do his bidding. Your opinion would’ve held more credence if yu had also called for their heads on the proverbial silver platter, ,but since you didn’t, and you do not substantiate your opinions with facts, you staements are nothing but more of the same ole progressive, leftist blather fo da da.  You say a lot, yet you say nothing.
Of you want ot be around your kind of thinkers, you should transfer out of USC and apply for entrance into one of the progressive leftivism sry
E schools such as Columbia, NYU or Univ of Chicago. Tere you can mingle and drink high caloric coffees with your kind. 
 As a vet, you kmow that our servixemen and women put the butts on the line so that folks like you have the freedom to complain. So if you don’t like war, go after the politicians not e military. Tjey can only execute policy.
Finally, why aren’t you writing about the fact that the Obama Administration has committed treasonous acts against the American people, by bypassing Congress and the Legislative process during his ttime as president. Fast and Furious gun running, bypassing states rights, allowing for illegal immigration without Congressional approval, Benghazi and the murder of our ambassador and 3 other men, that in and of itself another gun running op that was illegal?  
You have missed a rral oppty to opine on something worthwhile, as opposed to following ithe footsteps of your peers who are uninformed and are just lemmings of the left.
I apologise in advance for the misspelling and grammar erros. I hate the iPad keyboard, but that’s what I have. You get the jist of my commentary.
At ease, Devil Dog: You question the integrity of a well-decorated officer. As far as his personal life, he made a mistake–don’t throw him under the bus. But, your article lacks essence and it is not convincing. You should have spent more time outlining your points and backing them up with more concrete evidence. For example, what years was he in charge? Why were there more casualties during his tenure? This sounds to me like you’re a part of the liberal agenda. Carry on.
I wonder what the author thinks about JFK and Clinton and feel if those gentlemen are also unfit to mentor students. We live in such a petty, shallow time when we can not distinguish what is or is not relevant when it comes to people of accomplishments. So we end up with bland, idiots that rarely show courage or stand out because the name f the game is to be just barely competent enough and not rock the boat. It is also sad a “journalist” can claim Petraeus has failed those in the armed services and does not advocate for veterans but the author does not substantiate these claims. The writer might be trying to impress someone at HuffPo or MSNBC and would make a fitting journalist in those hack rags. 
Whether it is Secret Service agents protecting our President or Generals fighting our wars – I actually don’t mind that they come with a healthy does of testosterone. Of course that means they are very passionate towards the females and perhaps that is just the biological consequences. I would rather that then a bunch of politically correct dweebs that collapse and cry at the first sign of danger.
Can we start being OK with men being men?
Petraeus is more unfit than the child molester professor (FBI’s top 10) and several other wack-job liberal professors who can’t keep there own hatred under control in the classroom?

The latest crisis in Syria requires United Nations action, and preferably military strikes to demonstrate the world’s unwillingness to tolerate chemical attacks on civilians. Unfortunately, because the U.N. Security Council’s Permanent 5 members retain a veto power, bringing a binding resolution on strikes before the U.N. essentially useless. The P5 is becoming an antiquated institution that stands in the way of international peacekeeping efforts and world progress.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The P5 members of the U.N. Security Council gained veto power in the organization following World War II because they were the most important leaders of the victorious powers. The U.S.S.R. (now Russia), China, France, the U.K. and the United States crafted the veto power to prevent the U.N. from taking action against permanent members or their national interests.
Thus, from 1946 to the present, the U.N. has been either prevented from or severely limited in taking action in former colonial territories held by the U.K. or France (especially in Africa), unable to help negotiate peace or undertake peacekeeping operations in former Soviet satellite states and limited in its ability to diffuse Cold War tensions that developed between NATO nations (including the United States, the U.K. and France) and Warsaw Pact states (the USSR and China). According to Dadalos.org, in some of the biggest conflicts and world challenges since the defeat of the Axis, the U.N. Security Council has been next to useless.
The structure of the veto power in the Security Council also means that resolutions that cannot garner P5 approval do not even come before the council, because the backing nations know the action is futile. Since Russia and China vetoed sanctions against the Assad regime in 2012, the United States didn’t even bother to bring the possibility of military strikes or U.N. intervention before the Security Council because they knew that Russia and China would block the measure -— as Ian Girrell pointed out in his article in The Guardian.
This kind of inaction has plagued the U.N. Security Council before. In 1994 during the Rwandan Genocide, the most horrendous slaughter of civilians in the latter part of the 20th century, the world watched as U.N. representatives, such as now retired Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, called for U.N. involvement in Rwanda to stop the killing of 10,000 civilians a day by Interahamwe genocidaires.Because the U.S. had previously vetoed or threatened to veto non-military observation missions (so-called Chapter Six interventions), so the world knew that the U.N. would be unable to approve military force for intervention, an act bitterly recorded by Dallaire in his book Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda.
These vetoes, by definition, work against majoritarian principles. This holdover from the post-WWII period, however, has become antiquated as the world has moved away from Machiavellian and Manichean worldviews and toward inclusive world governance as a model for achieving cooperation and peace. Even where the majority of the world wants to act, in cases such as the current Syrian crisis, veto power offers no recourse. It is because of this that when the U.N. established the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, the U.N. sought to give member states a way to act even when P5 powers used their veto to prevent world intervention.
Unfortunately, according to Mehrdad Payandeh in the Yale Law Journal, nothing came of these actions and veto power still governs R2P interventions. Even when most of the world agrees on a course of action, the veto power of the P5 can derail the entire process.
The unrestrained power of the P5 means that the U.N. is losing credibility as a world institution. As Professor Manuel Castells, the Wallis Annenberg Chair of Communication Technology and Society at the University of Southern California, argued in his lecture, “Global Governance and Global Politics,” governing bodies experiencing a crisis of efficiency occurs when governments are unable to act to deal with serious problems, and a crisis of legitimacy occurs when democracy fails in democratically-based governing institutions that fail to act democratically. The U.N. — because of the Security Council veto power — is undergoing both crises. The U.N. has the ability to be a credible and effective institution, but not if the P5 veto power threatens the entire peacekeeping process, which is perhaps the greatest function of the U.N. Veto power in the P5 is too damaging to world interests and must be rethought and reformed.

No, the UN is not a club of morons. It has become a multi-billion-dollar bureaucracy of career wonks, parasites, moochers, useless diplomats, well-paid support staff, professional courtiers, flesh-eating zombies, and altruist snobs, paid for largely by U.S. contributions and dues. The UN is a signal instance of how we are paying for our own destruction. 
There isn’t a single UN agency that has done a lick of good. It has never solved the “problems” of hunger, disease, and poverty, and never will, because it has a vested interest in perpetuating those things. The only good thing it has done was to approve the creation of Israel, and that was in the way of an apology for the West not having opposed Nazi Germany early enough to prevent WWII, as a kind of compensation for the Holocaust. 
No good could ever come from a formal association with what has become a clique of dictatorships, authoritarian régimes, welfare states, and feudal monarchies, for the alleged purpose of advancing “peace.” But ever since its creation the world has seen more strife, turmoil, butchery, misery, and slaughter than in any other period of human history, except perhaps during the Dark Ages, when the competition in death was between disease and savages.
P5 is functioning a lot like the US Senate, where a minority controls what happens and what does not.
