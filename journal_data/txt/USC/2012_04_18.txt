Ming Qu, a graduate student studying electrical engineering known for his deep love of family, died April 11 in a shooting west of campus. He was 23.
He received his undergraduate degree in Beijing but was originally from the Jilin province of China.

Biao Yang, also a graduate student studying electrical engineering, spoke at a memorial service for Qu and Ying Wu, Qu’s close friend who was also killed in the assault, on Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium.
“We went to class together, we ate together and we hung out. [Qu] hoped he was just like any one of us who got a chance to learn,” Yang said.
Yang, who called Qu his best friend and dear brother, said he had known Qu for six years, and it was Qu who encouraged him to attend USC as a graduate student. Over the years, Yang said that his friendship with Qu never changed.
Yang remembered meeting Qu on the first day of their freshman year in college and teaching him to play sports.
“[He was] not really good at those sports, but it does not matter at all. What matters is that we were together,” Yang said. “But now it will never be like that again.”
The families of both victims arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday and attended the memorial service Wednesday.
Yang said Qu was very close to his parents and chose to live humbly in order to save them money.
“[Qu] once told me that [his] parents were the most important people in [his] heart. [He] chatted with his mother every two days,” Yang said at the memorial. “I could feel [his] deep love for [his] parents.”
Qu and Wu were shot and killed outside Wu’s residence while sitting inside Qu’s car. No arrests have been made. The university and the City of Los Angeles are offering a $200,000 reward for information leading to and arrest and conviction in the case.
This is not surprising. This area is just full of black gangs and the LAPD just don’t want to do anything about it. They should bring in the Army and go house to house and clean out the area of the trash.
It’s sickening that some thug idiot could do this to these two ambitious loving kids. So full of energy and passion for family and the love of learning. Definitely were on the path do being proud Trojan graduates and to do something great with their lives. I hope the LAPD finds the thug and the justice system takes care of him with the maximum punishment. The thug is less than human IMO. Should not be on the streets and should not be interacting with the rest of society. Scum.
Ming is from the Jilin province of China. Ying Wu is from Hunan.
It’s almost like LAPD should get their fat asses off the row and out of chipotle and do, I don’t know, police work.

Ying Wu, a graduate student studying electrical engineering known for her love of learning, died April 11 in a shooting west of campus. She was 23.
Wu’s friend, Ming Qu, was also killed in the assault.
Memory · Ying Wu is remembered by friends for her modesty and desire to learn. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Wu, a native of the Hunan province of China, lived with a host family, who considered her a member of their family since she began living with them in June 2011.
Jacqueline Hamilton, Wu’s host mother, described Wu as being extremely modest, determined and studious.
“She was a very determined young woman who enjoyed cooking and spent a lot of time in the library,” Hamilton said at a press conference on Friday. “[Wu and Qu] were modest students trying to make a life for themselves and achieve the promise that they saw available to them through a good education.”
Hamilton said Wu and Qu were extremely close friends who spent most of their free time together and were growing closer in the weeks leading up to her death.
“Sometimes they’d sit on the porch and talk for a half an hour or more because I think they were really getting to like each other a lot and couldn’t bear to part,” Hamilton said. “She had a smile on her face for the last several weeks that hard studying didn’t put there.”
Jing Ye, one of Wu’s close friends and a graduate student studying electrical engineering, said Wu loved to read and learn.
“[Wu] would enjoy studying so much that [she was] always working in the library day and night, so others always refer to [her] as a seed planted in the library,” Ye said. “When a friend who was coming back from China asked what [she] would like, [she] said books.”
Ye said Wu will be remembered as a kind, hard-working and emotional person, who cared deeply about those around her.
“[Wu] would not give up or complain when facing challenges. After receiving an undesirable testing result, [she] said that [she] would work even harder,” Ye said. “[She] loved life so much. [She] said that [one] should treasure time and fulfill life with meaning. [Wu] always woke up early in the morning, not willing to waste every minute.”
Going to school and returning from the library should not be a death sentence.  But in the perverse world of Los Angeles, it is, and sadly, will continue to be…
A real tradegy. USC officials should spend less time smooching with rich donors and more time on basics-like security and housing.

In response to a recent movement by the Los Angeles City Council to end the distribution of single-use plastic bags in supermarket checkout lines, USC is looking to incorporate alternative options, such as reusable bags, in hospitality venues on campus.
The Los Angeles City Council’s Energy and Environment Committee submitted a formal proposal April 5 for a ban on plastic and paper bags at more than 7,500 stores throughout Los Angeles.
Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality, said the challenge for the university is figuring out ways to make reusable bags easy for students to obtain and use.
“The issue is a lot of folks end up doing the same thing with reusable bags as disposable bags,” Klinger said.
Jimmy Villaflor, a freshman majoring in pop music, said if reusable bags were conveniently available on campus he would use them.
“It wouldn’t be too hard to go from plastic bags to reusable bags,” Villaflor said. “It doesn’t seem any more inconvenient.”
Liz Bitzer, a sophomore majoring Spanish, said she carries her books, bags and a guitar with her around school every day. For her, having the option of plastic bags on campus is a matter of convenience and choice.
“As much as I’d love to bring a recyclable bag with me to class every day, I can’t,” Bitzer said. “I think that if you were to take them away entirely you wouldn’t have a lot of happy campers or students.”
The university plans to look at plastic bag bans at other universities to find the best way to implement its own policy.
“We’re trying to get an idea of the best practices so we can come up with an idea for what we want to do next year and get ahead of the game,” Klinger said.
Yeah, they should replace the plastic with bullet-proof ones…

The Marshall School of Business won first place Sunday at Challenge 4 Charity, a yearlong competition among nine West Coast graduate business schools to accumulate the most hours of community service and raise the most money for charitable organizations.
The team of Marshall MBA students won the Golden Briefcase Award, given to the team with the highest competition score, for the third year in a row. This year, the USC chapter staged 20 fundraising events, volunteered more than 5,300 hours and raised $150,000 for charity.

Brian Wang, co-chairman of the USC Challenge 4 Charity chapter, said the award represents the effort put forth by the entire graduate school throughout the year.
“A lot of hard work and dedication goes into raising over $150,000 and volunteering over 5,300 hours of service,” Wang said. “C4C hosts the Marshall Business tailgates where all proceeds go to charity, puts on all of our business school parties, plans an alumni gala and works with Special Olympics, A Better LA and Junior Achievement to create volunteer opportunities for full-time MBA students.”
The competition culminated with the Challenge 4 Charity weekend, held this year at Stanford University, where teams from each school competed in sporting events such as football, ultimate Frisbee, dodgeball and swimming. The results of the events were factored into each school’s overall competition score.
Nicholas Hasara, a graduate student studying business administration, said everybody played a part in the fundraising portion and the sports aspect of the competition.
“Our leadership did a great job of coordinating events with our charity organizations and getting the students to rally around the cause,” Hasara said. “For the sports aspect, we had a lot of students step up by organizing practices and getting us ready for the weekend.”
Shantanu Dutta, vice dean for graduate programs at Marshall, said the victory represents the school’s achievement in social work.
“Our MBA team’s success demonstrates Marshall’s commitment to developing business leaders who are working toward the greater good of society,” Dutta said.
Alex Abraham, co-chairman of the USC Challenge 4 Charity chapter, said the competition is important because it makes a positive impact.
“There are two main reasons why MBAs hold the golden briefcase in such high regard,” Abraham said. “One is that it represents the positive work we have collectively put in to improve the local Los Angeles community. The second reason is simply the fact that it is something every West Coast business school tries to win each year,” Abraham said. “It is a chance for USC to go head-to-head with UCLA, Stanford, Berkeley, [the University of Washington], and utterly dominate the competition.”

Many students and local residents were startled after a Dept. of Public Safety officer fired one shot at an armed robbery suspect, who Los Angeles Police Department said is a Compton-area gang member, early Wednesday morning.
The shooting occurred on 30th Street near Figueroa Street, after the two male victims followed the suspect, identified as Jeremy Hendricks, 24, from The Row, where the robbery occurred. The suspect was confronted by a patrolling DPS officer, who shot Hendricks in the leg after he appeared to be reaching for a weapon.

“At first, it was just surreal,” said Sahar Youdai, a senior majoring in architecture, who lives in an apartment building in front of where Hendricks was shot. “I woke up to hearing someone say ‘Put your hands up’ and then the gunshot, so at first it didn’t register.”
The incident marks one week since the fatal shooting of two USC graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, near 27th Street and Raymond Avenue.
Reed Foster, a sophomore majoring in economics and mathematics, said the incident was especially unsettling in light of last week’s shooting.
“Everyone was kind of getting over the death of the two graduate students and then this happened,” said Foster, who was at his fraternity house during the incident. “Everyone is kind of in a daze right now.”
Though Foster said the shooting does not change his opinion about safety off campus, he said he will strive to be more conscious of his surroundings.
“This [doesn’t] change how I feel about my safety,” Foster said. “It just makes me kind of more aware. I’m not likely to go out and walk by myself with my iPod or be drunk.”
USC officials did not send a Trojan Alert — a multi-platform alert that provides information on immediate threats — because they determined that no students were in immediate danger following the shooting. Though officials sent an email about the incident to the USC community Wednesday morning, the decision to not send a Trojan Alert raised concerns among students and parents, according to a statement released by Todd Dickey, senior vice president for administration.
“We must always balance the community’s desire to know against the need to send out text alerts judiciously, in order to ensure maximum attention and response in case of an immediate threat or emergency,” Dickey said.
Dickey said that, in the future, officials will consider other methods, such as tweeting or only sending an email, for conveying pertinent information in similar situations.
“We will consider all delivery options for alerts in future situations where a threat does not exist but the university community would benefit from more timely information,” Dickey said.
Lynette Hammond, who lives on 30th Street the location of the shooting, said she was scared when she woke up to news of the shooting Wednesday morning. She was especially surprised by the incident because she said the area where it occurred is perceived as being among the safer off-campus living options for students.
“It’s really bad,” Hammond said, “Because this is supposed to be the good part. Here you are, going to school, minding your business and no one should have to be afraid.”
Hammond, however, said students could prevent more incidents from occurring by limiting risky behavior, such as drinking and staying out extremely late.
“The kids kind of have to curb it a little, too, because they have a false sense of security with [DPS], the police and the people in yellow jackets.”
With all the security precautions, Hammond said there is little the school can do to improve prevention.
“What else can they do?” Hammond said. “They can’t call in the National Guard.”
Foster said he still believes the area is safe for students, although he said students are safer living in buildings that are more secure.
“Things like this are bound to happen,” Foster said. “If I were sending my kid here, I’d be more comfortable with them living on campus or in a Greek house or one of these larger apartment complexes, as opposed to a neighborhood home.”
If a girl got raped would Hammond be asking what was the victim wearing?
Why is it we say what a girl wears is not relevant if she is a rape victim but then we turn around and can say you will be more likely be a victim of violent street crimes if you stay out late? Which is it – are we for blaming the victim or not?
It is just  shameeful that this could happen. Why doesn’t USC Officials spend more time on basic security, student housing and less on publicity seeking donor events. Students are paying very high fees and don’t get the level of safety they deserve. Its time Los Angeles cleaned out the area and expanded USC gated boundary. USC also needs to stop people who have no business to be on campus from wandering about. I have seen many trouble makers hanging about.
too bad DPS didn’t aim for the head
Why do you do it.
“What else can they do?” Hammond said. “They can’t call in the National Guard.”
Not a half bad idea.  South Central is a warzone full of thugs.  Declare martial law and take back the streets.

A Dept. of Public Safety officer shot an armed robbery suspect early Wednesday morning near the intersection of West 30th Street and Shrine Place. The suspect was then arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department.
Jeremy Hendricks, 24, allegedly approached two male and two female USC students on 28th Street near Figueroa Street and demanded their property. The students saw Hendricks had a gun and complied.

Hendricks stashed the students’ belongings in a backpack and ran through a parking lot toward 30th Street, according to LAPD.
The male students chased Hendricks and flagged down LAPD officers.
DPS officers on patrol confronted Hendricks on 30th Street. A DPS officer fired a single shot that wounded Hendricks in the leg when the officer saw Hendrick had a gun.
A possible accomplice was also waiting in a car nearby, though this suspect was not apprehended.
LAPD recovered the gun but DPS declared the area safe. Police have Hendricks in custody, where he is being treated for his injuries.
Hendricks is a documented Compton-area gang member who is on probation for manufacturing dangerous weapons, according to the Los Angeles Times.
He was previously arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, burglary and robbery.
Hendricks was charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.
Though many students living on The Row and 30th Street heard the gunshot, USC did not issue a Trojans Alert text message at the time of the shooting.
A statement released by Todd Dickey, senior vice president for administration, said USC chose not to send out a Trojans Alert because Hendricks was immediately apprehended.
Instead, the university sent an Incident Resolution Notice email to students around 8 a.m., Dickey said in a statement, however, the concerns many voiced about the lateness of this message were valid, he said.
“We will consider all delivery options for alerts in future situations where a threat does not exist but the university community would benefit from more timely information,” Dickey said.
The shooting comes one week after the shooting of graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu, leaving many concerned about the safety of the area.
Has Nikias  made any statements regarding the recent shootings near USC? If not, why not?
Unless of course the only attribute we want in a President at USC is to be good at raising money.
Why doesn’t Nikias do more about safety. Its not just these shootings, but theft of bicycles and muggings-even on campus. USC needs to tighten access to who can come and go on campus, more lighting and CCTV around parking and bicycle centres. And the campus needs to exten further out, buy out more properties and bring the students into a safer environment. USC reputation has taken a big hit with these murders and shootings.

Hundreds gathered Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium as the USC community remembered Ying Wu and Ming Qu, two electrical engineering graduate students killed early April 11 west of USC’s campus.
Holding a memorial service a week after Wu’s and Qu’s deaths — the traditional mourning custom in Chinese culture — speakers overwhelmingly stressed the role the Trojan Family and its considerable international community have played in the days since the tragedy and will continue to play in days to come.

President C. L. Max Nikias and Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, made clear the connection they felt to family and friends assembled, as both Nikias and Yortsos had once been international graduate students in America. Like Wu and Qu, both eventually became part of the Trojan Family.
“I know something of the life [Wu and Qu] lived, because my wife and myself were once them,” Nikias said. “We dreamed of a better life through better education. There is a loneliness of being a foreign student in a foreign land. Many of you know this firsthand. When you come to Los Angeles, you become more than a citizen of a major metropolis. You, like them, became a member of the sacred Trojan Family.”
Yortsos also underlined his shared experiences, both as an international graduate student and a parent of a Viterbi student.
“I know that I speak the same language as you, because I am like you,” Yortsos told the hundreds of international students assembled. “Like you, I came to this country as a foreign graduate student. I came thirsty for education, thirsty to explore the world. Like you, I came to make a difference.”
While Nikias and Yortsos drew from their own lives to connect with much of the crowd, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni stressed that the community must look forward and carry on Wu’s and Qu’s memory.
“[Chinese philosopher] Lao-Tzu said, ‘A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,’” Soni said. “Remembering is only the beginning: We must also carry their precious gifts of love, honor, duty, hard work and sacrifice with us throughout our lives and in all that we do. As we honor them, let us cherish their memory that remains with us as a blessing for all of us.”
In looking beyond the tragedy, Nikias took the opportunity to announce a yearly memorial scholarship fund in Wu’s and Qu’s names.
“The holders of this scholarship will have the qualities — restrained intelligence, unyielding ambition, unassailable accomplishment and kindness — that they did,” Nikias said. “This scholarship fund will ensure that [their] dreams will live on forever, with the opportunities it opens up for other students. To further their memory we can also commit ourselves to building a safer city and world.”
Nikias’ call for a safer world was echoed throughout the night as the yet unsolved murders of Wu and Qu cast a further pall on proceedings.
“We engineers and scientists are analytical and methodical,” Yortsos said. “Why do things happen? When we are confronted with an unexplainable tragedy, we struggle to understand. Answers will hopefully be provided, hopefully soon. In the interim, we can persevere by choosing hope and faith for those questions we cannot answer.”
Chinese Consul General Qiu Shaofang, a late addition to the services, appealed law enforcement to act and stressed the value of every Chinese citizen, at home or abroad.
“The ministry of foreign affairs, ministry of education and the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles acted immediately after the tragedy happened and have committed  [to] join efforts in tackling problems arising from the incident,” Shaofang said. “As Chinese Premier Hu Jintao has said, China has a population of 1.3 billion and every one is precious.”
Just as China places value in all its citizens, Nikias reminded attendees once again that the Trojan Family will continue to offer support wherever needed.
“We share your grief, which weighs heavy on our hearts,” Nikias said. “Your loss weighs heavy on our university and its thousands of supporters. We also share what your children gave us, which enriched our lives immeasurably.”
my heart is breaking to  think of these parents and the lives taken from their children. a sad time for us all.
be careful please, all students . we love you more than anything. usc please up the security even more.
a parent.
Ming and Ying were their respective parents’ only children.  In essence, the Qu and Wu family lines are wiped out.  We have covered this at the Fairbank Report.
And I do agree with CBtYC’s comment.
I send hope for support and love in this time of pain and grief to Ming Qu and Ying Wu’s families, classmates, friends and loved ones. 
– A fellow graduate student and member of the Trojan family
Your swipe at China’s policies, while feigning compassion, is completely and utterly reprehensible.  I suppose if the parents had two children each, the deaths would somehow be less tragic.  Pathetic.
That photo is particularly heartbreaking in light of China’s cruel one-child restriction. I wonder if Ming Qu and Ying Wu were their parents’ only children. How devastating.

USC was dubbed the No. 1 “Quarterback U” in an ESPN article published on Monday by sportswriter Brock Huard.
Sportswriters use the unofficial title to label a university for its propensity to develop high quality quarterbacks that find success in the National Football League.
“Quarterback U” · Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart, who started at quarterback from 2003-2006, is one of several Trojan signal-callers to have been drafted highly in the past decade. - Daily Trojan file photo
ESPN placed USC at the top of the list for several reasons, including having the No. 2 media market in the country, an ideal climate to train year-round, an $85-million football facility, a staff well-versed in the NFL atmosphere and an offense that prominently features the quarterback position.
The article cited Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, along with Matt Cassel, Mark Sanchez and senior Matt Barkley, as examples of USC’s capacity to produce NFL-level quarterbacks in the last decade.
Palmer was drafted No. 1 overall in 2003, Leinart was drafted No. 10 overall in 2006 and Sanchez was drafted No. 5 overall in 2009.
Palmer, Cassel and Sanchez are currently the starting quarterbacks for their respective NFL teams, while Leinart saw brief starting stints in Arizona and Houston but has suffered three season-ending injuries in his career.
Barkley is considered the favorite for the Heisman Trophy award next season and a frontrunner for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL draft.
The article also called USC coach Lane Kiffin the John Calipari of college football, referring to the University of Kentucky basketball coach known for his ability to recruit young talent and prepare them for the professional level.
Behind USC, Huard ranks Alabama, Stanford, Missouri and Washington as four other teams worthy of the “Quarterback U” title.
The name “Quarterback U” deviates from USC’s original nickname, “Tailback U,” which emerged in the 1960s when USC produced Heisman Trophy-winning- tailbacks Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson.
Tailbacks Charles White and Marcus Allen would follow as two more Heisman winners in 1979 and 1981, respectively.
Since then, USC has only produced one Heisman-winning running back in Reggie Bush, who voluntarily forfeited the award after an NCAA investigation ruled that he was ineligible to participate as a student-athlete at USC.

Stanford
Ogwumike selected No. 1 in WNBA Draft
The Los Angeles Sparks took Stanford’s Nnemkadi Ogwumike as the top overall pick in the 2012 WNBA Draft this week.
She is the first Pac-12 player to be the top draft pick since 1997. USC’s Tina Thompson was picked first overall that year.
Ogwumike, a three-time All-American, is second all-time in Pac-12 scoring (2,491), third all-time in rebounding (1,226) and has a 58.3 shooting percentage. This year the 6-foot-2 power forward was named Pac-12 Player of the Year, an honor she also received in 2010.
The Cardinal appeared in the NCAA Final Four during each of Ogwumike’s four seasons. Ogwumike averaged 22.5 points and 10 rebounds  this season.
She plans on graduating from Stanford and pursuing a graduate degree in business before she begins playing for the Sparks next season.
Three other Pac-12 players were drafted into the WNBA this year, including USC guards Briana Gilbreath and Jacki Gemelos, both of whom went in the third round.
Oregon’s Amanda Johnson was drafted in the final round. The Washington Mystics selected Gilbreath, Gemelos went to the Minnesota Lynx and Johnson went to the Phoenix Mercury.
Oregon
ESPN exposes Ducks’ marijuana culture
In an ESPN The Magazine article, writer Sam Alipour reported that widespread marijuana use has been common among student-athletes nationwide, specifically among Oregon football players for the past 15 years.
Alipour reported 19 current or past players and officials acknowledged the use of marijuana as a commonality. They estimated between 40 and 60 percent of team members smoke pot.
According to Alipour, Oregon coach Chip Kelly is trying to crack down on the team’s usage by enforcing drug tests and attending classes with problem players.
“Student-athlete welfare is of the utmost importance to the University of Oregon,” Oregon Athletic Director Rob Mullens told ESPN. “Similar to many college campuses wrestling with the same issue, the University of Oregon actively works to address potential use of any illegal substance through a combination of education, prevention and enforcement activities.”
The Princeton Review ranks the University of Oregon as one of the most pot-friendly schools in the country.
In 1998, Oregon became one of the first states to legalize medical marijuana, and the state is one of the nation’s leading producers of the drug.
 
Tennessee
Record-setting coach steps down
Pat Summitt, who leads NCAA coaches in all-time wins, is stepping down as the women’s basketball coach at the University of Tennessee, the university announced Wednesday.
Summit coached at Tennessee for 38 seasons, racked up a record of 1,098-208 and led the Lady Vols to 18 Final Four appearances, 13 national title games and eight national championships.
Summitt, 59, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease in 2011 but continued on with the team through the end of the 2011-2012 season. Summitt will continue working for the school as head coach emeritus. Her new title allows for more time to focus on her health while also recruiting and mentoring young players.
“Coaching is the great passion of my life, and the job to me has always been an opportunity to work with our student-athletes and help them discover what they want,” Summitt said in a statement. “I will continue to make them my passion.”
Holly Warlick, who has served as Summitt’s assistant coach for 27 years, will take over the head coaching position next season.
The Lady Vols went 27-9 last season and advanced to the Elite 8.
Texas A&M
SEC T-shirts recalled for map mishap
A Texas T-shirt company recalled dozens of Texas A&M shirts after complaints about geographical and factual mistakes, according to the Associated Press.
A section of the United States is mapped on the shirt, with the states of the SEC represented. North Carolina was incorrectly included in the design and Missouri was omitted.
Missouri and Texas A&M joined the SEC this year after leaving the Big 12 at the end of last season.
“Many … have insinuated that Texas A&M made these shirts, and that Texas A&M doesn’t know geography. That’s simply not true. Aggieland Outfitters designed the shirt and simply made a mistake,” Aggieland Outfitters said in a statement to the AP.
 
Kentucky
Five starters declare for NBA Draft
In a televised press conference Tuesday, University of Kentucky freshmen Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and Marquis Teague, and sophomores Terrence Jones and Doron Lamb declared their eligibility for the NBA Draft.
The five starters led the school to an SEC title and the Kentucky’s  eighth NCAA title. Seniors Darius Miller and Eloy Vargas also plan on entering the draft.

Crimson Tide 2011 BCS Trophy Shatters
The Crimson Tide’s 2011 BCS trophy was accidentally knocked from its perch and shattered Saturday, ESPN reported.
A football player’s father got his foot caught on a rug resting below the Waterford crystal football’s holding place, and the trophy was knocked to the ground.
Valued at $30,000, the trophy was handcrafted in Ireland and put on display at Mal Moore Athletic Facility. Alabama has a second identical 2011 trophy, on display at the Paul W. Bryant Museum.
The university said it will attempt to replace the shattered trophy.
 
Toledo
NCAA bans school from postseason
The NCAA banned the University of Toledo’s men’s basketball program from the 2013 postseason tournament, rejecting the university’s appeal.
Toledo failed to meet the NCAA’s Academic Performance Rate for several years, resulting in the ban.
In its appeal, Toledo asked the NCAA to consider the school’s 2011-2012 academic performance, and not older scores from 2009-2011.
“It is simply a question of fairness,” athletic director Mike O’Brien said.

Injuries continue to hinder performances for the men’s and women’s track and field teams, becoming a growing concern as the season takes the team closer to the high-profile USC-UCLA dual meet.
This weekend, injuries might become more apparent, as the Trojans will be spread thin at three separate meets.
Despite the high risk for re-injury, the team will attend two Cal State meets: the Beach Invitational held by Cal State Long Beach on Saturday and the Cal State Los Angeles Twilight Open on Thursday.
Injury bug · Sophomore sprinter Aaron Brown was a freshman All-American in 2011. The entire Trojan squad has been hampered by injuries this season, resulting in some less-than-stellar finishes thus far. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information 
Thursday through Saturday the team competes at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut, Calif.
Acting as a final performance test before the big meet with UCLA, this weekend’s meets are crucial to the track and field department’s continued success.
Whether or not these injuries will affect the team’s performance as the outdoor season continues is a serious question.
A number of nagging hamstring injuries have kept many of USC’s top athletes from performing at the most recent meets, in track events as well as on the field.
The Trojans and the Women of Troy have set several personal records, but these achievements will mean little if many of teams’ athletes are performing at partial strength through the season.
Easter weekend was a rare break for the USC track and field squad; the weekend prior to that saw the team competing at three events across the nation.
Though the team should be well-rested following the holiday, it remains unclear whether injuries — both old and new — will continue to play a part in the team’s efforts. In particular, a number of aggravating hamstring injuries to both the men’s and women’s teams continue to hinder the efforts of USC’s prestigious outdoor track program in the 2012 season.
For the Trojans, star sophomore sprinter Josh Mance continues to fight a nagging hamstring injury.
The injury simultaneously disqualified the record-setting men’s 400-meter relay team at the Texas Relays, while raising questions about whether Mance should make attempts at recovery instead of competing.
Mance previously achieved leading 400-meter times, and his recovery is crucial to the relay team’s success.
Likewise, the Women of Troy face mounting issues regarding injuries. Sophomore sprinter Jessica Davis has not been competing in previous weeks because of a sore hamstring. Davis remains one of the Women of Troy’s top performers.
If Davis recovers by the time this weekend’s events roll around, it will be the first time she competes this outdoor season for USC.

In a season full of walk-off victories for USC baseball, the Trojans (20-15) couldn’t get that elusive game-winning hit against UC Santa Barbara. And that wasn’t the worst of it.
USC blew a three-run ninth-inning lead against the Gauchos (18-17), then gave up a game-winning single in the 12th.
After retiring the first two hitters of the inning, junior pitcher Matt Munson gave up a single, a hit batsman and finally the eventual game-winning single to Gaucho infielder Peter Maris, just the second RBI of Maris’ career.
So close · Sophomore second baseman James Roberts had two hits against the Gauchos. Unfortunately, it was not enough to secure a win. - Adrian Hoffman | Daily Trojan
The Trojans put up a four-spot in the sixth to take a 4-1 lead, and took that lead into the ninth.
But senior closing pitcher Martin Viramontes gave up three consecutive singles to lead off the ninth to make it 4-2. With runners at the corners, the Gauchos attempted a sacrifice bunt.
The bunt was popped up and caught by Viramontes, but his throw to first in an attempt to double-off the runner was wild, allowing that runner to move to second and the runner on third to score.
Freshman Wyatt Strahan was brought into the game with one out and the tying run at second, and gave up a game-tying single to the first hitter he faced, forcing extra innings.
The Gaucho rally squandered a tremendous outing by Andrew Triggs.
After giving up back-to-back singles to lead off the game, yielding one first-inning run, the senior ace retired 19 of the last 21 Gaucho hitters he faced, including 11 straight from the third through the sixth inning.
Triggs’ final line was impressive as usual: one run on three hits over seven innings, with one walk to four strikeouts.
Usually the Trojans’ Friday night ace, Triggs was able to get four full days of rest following his start in Tempe, Ariz.
The Trojans have this coming weekend off, so Triggs will not be slated to start again until the following Friday.
It looked for a while like Triggs, plagued all season by a lack of run support, would be the recipient of another weak offensive showing.
Save for a 15-run outburst against Washington State at the end of March, the Trojans had scored a combined five runs over Triggs’ last four starts.
But junior shortstop Adam Landecker led off the sixth with a walk.
Senior first baseman Matt Foat followed that up with an infield single, and both runners advanced 90 feet when the throw to first was wild, the first of three Gaucho errors in the inning.
Landecker scored on an RBI-single to tie the game and Foat scored on the second error of the inning — a passed ball — to give the Trojans the lead, 2-1.
With the bases loaded and two down, a groundball to the second baseman led to the Gauchos’ third error of the inning, scoring two and giving USC a 4-1 lead.
But apart from that four-run outburst, the Trojan offense did not put up much of a fight throughout the rest of the game. USC only managed to put two runners on base in the fourth, ninth and 11th innings, and they hit into a double play in all three.
This one will sit with the Trojans for a while, and not just because of the nature of the loss.
They have almost a full week off before returning to action at Dedeaux Field on Tuesday at 6 p.m. against Long Beach State.

The highlight of Saturday’s spring game did not involve football.
It wasn’t the touchdown that senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw to sophomore receiver Marqise Lee in the corner of the end zone.
It wasn’t the pair of interceptions that senior cornerback Isiah Wiley made either.
No, it happened when the Trojans stood around with their helmets off, looking down at the field at a 5-year-old boy wearing a cardinal No. 7 jersey.
Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Before the highly anticipated game even began, Barkley, senior safety TJ McDonald and senior punter Kyle Negrete stood around as a boy, who goes by the name McClain, stabbed the field as only true USC Trojans can with a fake sword roughly a quarter the size of Tommy Trojan’s.
McClain suffers from a rare blood disease that might ultimately prove fatal, but, looking at the boy on that cool Saturday afternoon, you sure wouldn’t know it. As he ran through Negrete’s legs and playfully tackled him, his       life-threatening illness hardly seemed to matter.
McClain was able to get on the field with the help of the Make-a-Wish Foundation, which has made it possible since 1980 for terminally ill children to live out their dreams while they can. The foundation has made these sorts of dreams realities for 250,000 children around the world.
For many children, their dream is to be on the field with their favorite professional team or to practice with stars like Jets quarterback Tim Tebow or Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade.
McClain’s dream? To lead his favorite team, the USC Trojans, out of the tunnel at the Coliseum.
And the players seemed to love it. Barkley was seen smiling on the JumboTron, helping the boy stab the field and helping him do traditional Trojan poses, including the “V” for victory. McDonald was beside Barkley, having fun and carrying McClain around the field. And there was Negrete, who, when tackled, received loud applause from the more than 15,000 fans at the game.
Traditionally, a spring game is the chance for a player to prove himself, to make his way up the depth chart, to make an impression on coaches and to excite fans for the season to come.
But Saturday was so much more than that for everyone at the Coliseum.
We didn’t learn who is going to be Barkley’s backup. We didn’t learn who is going to start opposite junior cornerback Nickell Robey, either.
We did, however, learn that football is just a game. It is a game that ends when the final whistle blows and the clock hits zero.
Unfortunately, a boy like McClain does not necessarily have the luxury of playing a game. Every day is a fight.
And to the delight of fans in attendance, the Trojans took a few minutes out of their hectic day to realize this in the midst of Saturday’s chaos.
For fans, the lasting memory of Saturday probably isn’t going to involve football at all. Sure, it is going to involve a football field, but that’s about it.
Fans will remember McClain being lifted on the broad shoulders of Barkley and McDonald, who already have the weight of an entire fan base on those shoulders, and of the boy doing his best Tommy Trojan impression.
And I don’t think the Trojans would have it any other way.
In a game that can be so violent and so time-consuming, it was obvious that when McClain was on the field, the only thing that mattered was McClain getting his chance to have a dream come true. It was a chance to show true emotion and humanity and to give hope for those who need it.
And without hesitation, the Trojans obliged.
As much as we like to think that our student-athletes train 24 hours a day, seven days a week to prepare for the grueling season that begins in September, these are actual people under the helmets and beneath the shoulder pads.
People who realize football is only a part of life, who know that sometimes doing the little things can mean so much to someone so small and that making a sick child’s dream come true is more important than throwing four touchdowns or beating a top-ranked team.
Besides, the smile that McClain wore was worth more than any tackle or touchdown could ever prove to be.

To pinpoint the missing element in indie-rock band Brigg Fair’s debut album Kill Yourself for Change, listeners need look no further than the last word of the album’s title: change.
Founder and lead singer Geoff Ereth has a pleasant enough voice, and many of Brigg Fair’s songs contain thought-provoking lyrics. The album, however, suffers from a lack of variety in its compositions, and the limitations of Ereth’s vocal range are clearly on display. Monotonous harmonies and vocals make it difficult to differentiate one song from another, which doesn’t exactly make for a great listening experience.
Three’s company · Geoff Ereth (left), Brian Senti (middle) and Trevor Gureckis (right) of Brigg Fair show a clear knack for storytelling in their debut album. The album falters, however, in its monotony and repetitiveness. - Photo courtesy of The Musebox
Ereth’s voice recalls that of Isaac Slade, lead singer of The Fray, and Chris Martin, who provides lead vocals for Coldplay, but doesn’t seem to possess the passion that both Slade and Martin consistently express on their recordings.
Ereth sings in measured, safe tones, as if he doesn’t want to push the limits of his range for fear of hitting a bad note.
This caution is detrimental to Kill Yourself for Change as a whole, as the album’s many droopy songs about failed relationships call for a wider spectrum of emotions, such as angst and sorrow, that Ereth’s voice doesn’t always convey. Ereth’s lack of vocal experimentation, which is most evident on the extremely one-note “Tides” and “Departures,” is especially disappointing because there are plenty of signs that he’s very talented. You get the impression that if he tried just a little harder, Brigg Fair’s debut would be much stronger and more emotionally charged.
This problem extends into the instrumentation. Brigg Fair’s utilization of melancholy compositions feel extremely similar throughout the album, creating an unfortunate phenomenon in which all the songs sound the same. After listening to two or three songs, the slow-paced, dejected ballads begin to meld into one boring track. Love songs like “Jolene” and “Lydia” sound nice, but they do not pack the catchy punch of similar tracks like The Fray’s “Heartbeat” or “Over My Head.”
These muted compositions also keep the album’s thematic messages from sounding truly convincing. Though the sound of Ereth’s voice over a synchronous harmony makes for nice background music, it does not quite engage the listener in a man’s despair over a heartbreaking goodbye.
The title track is a welcome departure from these droning ballads, but it falls short of a musical success. The phrase “How’d you like to make some money? How’d you like to kill yourself for change?” repeats over and over, to the point where you’ll desire silence for a change. The lyrics try to assert that America’s recession-ravaged economy is leading desperate and impoverished individuals to compromise their morals and values in exchange for a quick buck.
It’s a fascinating concept, but an underdeveloped one: The song’s repetitive lyrics fail to explore the depth of the repercussions of the economic downturn.
“Kill Yourself for Change” is yet another example of how Brigg Fair flaunts potential, yet can’t quite achieve greatness.
Despite these major faults, Kill Yourself for Change isn’t a complete failure. Ereth’s voice is appealing and many songs contain thought-provoking lyrics that tell the timeless story of lost love in a fresh way — Brigg Fair certainly has a talent for this type of storytelling.
“I Gave You Blood” describes an adolescent romance in which Ereth details how his paramour lost interest in him once she went to college. The heartfelt nature of the lyrics is captivating, and resonates with anyone who has drifted away from a significant other because of distance.
“Heart Attacks” is another lyrical triumph. The track features touching phrases like “I fell in love, but it was friendship in disguise” that add depth and dimensionality to the love story. Again though, the downtrodden beats and monotonous singing just don’t match the passion of the words — Ereth’s cautious vocalization makes it sound as if he’s singing about slipping into a coma instead of having a heart attack.
The most frustrating aspect of Kill Yourself for Change is that Brigg Fair shows clear potential. A talented lead singer and a knack for storytelling gives listeners a glimpse into how successful Brigg Fair could be if the band simply explored its musicality a little more. Though listening to the pleasant but not passionate sounds of Kill Yourself won’t inspire suicidal thoughts, listeners won’t help but yearn for a little more variety.

Gotye
Thursday, April 19, at 8 p.m.
Nokia Theatre
Who would have thought that a Belgian-born, Australian-bred indie-rock singer would hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100?
Gotye’s smash-hit single “Somebody That I Used to Know” is practically inescapable these days, and for good reason — the jangly, mournful tune flaunts a brilliantly catchy chorus and spot-on guest vocals from New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra.
Thankfully for everyone who can’t stop humming the melody, Gotye is bringing his signature sound to Nokia Theatre for a performance that will show off all his quirky, dynamic material.
He’s bringing along Kimbra as well, and the concert looks to highlight the duo’s musical chemistry as well as give her a chance to shine onstage.
Considering how popular Gotye has become in the past few months, it’s fair to say that tickets will go fast.
 
Earth Day at L.A. Live
Sunday, April 22, noon – 6 p.m.
L.A. Live
In our daily hustle and bustle, we sometimes forget to appreciate Earth’s natural resources and environments, which led to the establishment of Earth Day more than three decades ago. This year, L.A. Live is hosting an expansive event to highlight the annual celebration.
Though there might be some irony in holding this event at one of Los Angeles’ most expansive and expensive entertainment developments, Earth Day at L.A. Live features exciting performers, booths and activities that are worth hitting up.
Some highlights include talent and athlete meet-and-greets, shirt silkscreening and a show by famed reggae frontman Elan Atias, formerly of legendary band The Wailers. All in all, the event looks like a pleasant way to spend a balmy Sunday afternoon, and celebrate the planet we share.
Los Angeles Comedy Festival
Friday, April 20-26
Location and times vary
They say laughter prolongs life, so what better way to get your stressed-out self through finals than to attend the Los Angeles Comedy Festival? It’s the largest comedy festival in the nation, after all, and the weeklong event makes for the perfect way to let off steam with more than a few good laughs.
The festival will feature live comedy shows, films, webseries and a screenplay competition.
To give you a better idea, past participants included Kate Bosworth, Zoë Saldana and Cedric the Entertainer. Many of these former competitors have gone on to take part in Last Comic Standing and Saturday Night Live, and some have even won an Oscar for best short film.
The festival has already proved itself and its talent. And with plenty of fresh acts — upcoming comedians, well-known talents, Ryan Gosling and even a short film poking fun at Titanic 3-D — to look forward to this year, the Los Angeles Comedy Festival is not one to miss.
 
Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives
Fowler Museum at UCLA
Ongoing exhibition
UCLA might suck, as the infamous Trojan football chant goes, but that doesn’t mean that Westwood isn’t worth checking out. With a mélange of culturally diverse art, The Fowler Museum at UCLA offers quite the incentive to head over to Bruin territory and check out Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives.
The long-term exhibition features more than 250 diverse works from the Fowler collection, originating from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas, which are displayed together to emphasize the value of fine arts and the impact these arts have on people.
Notable works include a detailed painted Chinese hand puppet, a 19th-century headdress designed by the Efut peoples of Nigeria and an ancient portrait vessel from Peru.
With such culturally diverse and enticing works, it seems as if you have no choice but to finally see this fine arts exhibit; we’re sure you have always meant to go to (hint, nudge) and now is your chance.

Comics are the funny books, the home of people in tights fighting each other, yet they are a great medium for social commentary and protest.
Since their inception, comic books have challenged the established system and worked to highlight injustice around the world. Comics created the space for activism because they were the underdog of media.
When they started in the 1930s, they were heirs to the pulp fiction legacy and favored by children, not influential adults. The writers were urban and influenced by the world around them. If cities were at the forefront of social and economic progress, then the comics that came out of them were timely and well aware of the troubles facing contemporary society.
Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel initially created Superman not as a defender of truth, justice and the American way, but as a defender of the New Deal. Accordingly, Superman spent his early issues taking on slum lords, corrupt businessmen and other symptoms of the Great Depression.
It was only in the 1950s that comics found their soapbox kicked out from under them. A mix of Congressional pressure and self-imposed censorship in the form of the Comics Code nearly killed the industry, and the remaining series in publication turned to camp and silly stories instead of social commentary. EC Comics cut back drastically on its sci-fi and horror series. For a few years, comics were essentially neutered.
That is, until the start of the 1970s. A new group of writers, influenced by the counter culture and political unrest of the 1960s, took over. Stan Lee, who revolutionized comics by focusing on heroes with personal issues — as opposed to the shining beacons of heroic perfection from the 1940s — decided to tackle drug use.
In the Amazing Spider-man arc “Green Goblin Reborn!” Spider-man confronted his best friend who had started using drugs. The arc took a strong look at the issue, but the Comics Code did not approve. As a result, Marvel published the issue without the code’s seal of approval, deeming it a story worth telling.
Meanwhile at DC, the creative team of Dennis O’Neil and Neal Adams teamed up the outspoken man of the people, Green Arrow, with space cop Green Lantern. The two heroes traveled across the United States, confronting poverty, racism and, ultimately, drug use when Green Arrow’s sidekick was revealed to be a heroin addict.
Comics work as a form of commentary because the medium itself is so vast. Art and the written word have been a part of revolutionary movements and activism for centuries, and the 20th century saw a wave of more abstract protest art. Comics allow for vivid images to capture the reader’s focus and for strong stories to point out faults or injustices.
Because comics are aimed at youth — the people who are most likely to be the most socially conscious — there’s a greater impact. Why should students support equal rights? Read X-Men to discover varying forms of discrimination and you’ll see why people should take action.
The 1970s-revived activism in comics took a new spin as British writers took over American series. Dark titles such as Hellblazer took on the politics and conservatism of the time; a number of these series eventually ended up under DC’s mature Vertigo line. Alan Moore and David Lloyd’s V for Vendetta was a direct reaction to Margaret Thatcher’s conservatism, and ended up as a prescient title with CCTV cameras everywhere in London.
And in the new millennium, that social activism is stronger than ever in comics. The underground and local zine scenes throughout the country influenced the new wave of writers coming from a new DIY mindset.
In the last few months, a group of writers and artists — including David Lloyd, the artist behind the V for Vendetta Guy Fawkes mask — used Kickstarter, a large funding platform, to support Occupy Comics. It’s very much in the zeitgeist, but it also aims to capture the spirit and motivations of the Occupy movement by providing a form of documentation for the ongoing protests.
But beyond the more oblique protest works like Occupy Comics, there are more subtle works. For instance, Brian Wood’s recently concluded DMZ was a sharp critique of the post-Sept. 11 world and an increasingly radical and distant political world, turning New York City into the front lines of a second American civil war. And there’s Scarlet, Brian Michael Bendis’ title about a revolution against today’s society.
Comics can be about superheroes, battles with evil exes or autobiographies, but they have an amazing potential for social commentary. They combine protest art, visual documentation and text in very interesting ways, and under the best of creative teams, social commentary can fuel exciting stories instead of feeling preachy. Comics have been calling out injustices for decades and hopefully will for many more to come.

Words with Friends, Farmville and Tetris Battle: Chances are you’re either hopelessly addicted to playing these games with your friends, or you’ve at least heard of them in passing.
Social gaming is a booming industry with  a $653 million revenue in 2011 and a projected 68.7 million users in 2012. Because of the ease of access for users — games are available either by logging into Facebook or picking up a smartphone — it’s easy to understand why social gaming has taken off so quickly.
Dynamic duo · Dimitri Sillam (left) and Mikhael Naayem (right) merged gaming with college funding via Grantoo, a program that offers an innovative approach to scholarships. - Photo courtesy of Grantoo
But who knew that playing social games could help you score college tuition?
Enter Grantoo, a tournament game platform with the novel idea of combining social gaming with financial aid. The startup company has partnered with colleges across the nation, including USC, to host tournaments where students play trivia, poker and Scrabble-like games to compete for prizes such as college tuition grants and donations toward causes of their choice.
Various sponsors, including WePay and Verizon, fund the winnings for each tournament. Through its unique business model, Grantoo hopes to attract companies looking to increase their brand notability and gain recognition with the college demographic, while also communicating the importance of tuition to students.
Grantoo’s founder, Dimitri Sillam, came up with the idea of connecting games to helping students pay for college when he was struggling to pay his own college bills. He partnered with his best friend, Mikhael Naayem, who took the idea further and suggested the opportunity for students to also donate to charities.
According to Caroline Blavet, head of business development at Grantoo, the response from colleges has been positive. Grantoo’s launch tournament on April 8 attracted several hundred participants from more than 21 universities, including USC, where nine winners received a total of $2,000 in grant winnings and charities were given $216.
“Students are already playing a lot of social games,” Blavet said. “We want students to play the games for something good, which is tuition. It’s absolutely ridiculous that tuitions have doubled in recent years, but it’s unfortunately the reality.”
Grantoo is just one of a number of socially responsible games that have cropped up in recent years, indicating a new trend of games that are designed to do social good.
For example, the Facebook game Wetopia from Sojo Studios allows users to donate to charity by building a virtual village. As users progress through the game, they accumulate points that turn into monetary donations to specific charities and social improvement projects.
Laird Malamed, an adjunct professor in interactive media at the School of Cinematic Arts and former Senior Vice President at Activision, noted that there is a definite trend toward using and designing games to benefit students and the community.
“Because of the rise of social media and social games, we’re going to see it spread into other areas that gaming touches,” Malamed said. “There’s also usually a high correlation of social responsibility with college students as well. What’s great about Grantoo’s model is not only do students win tuition, but they also give to charity — it’s a more powerful social motivator.”
Malamed also noted that while student interest in socially responsible games might not be a huge concern now, it could change in the near future.
“There’s growing interest, but it’s still small,” Malamed said. “Until it’s more obvious that you can start a social gaming company for a good cause, and that it can be a viable concern, you can only get a handful of people interested. But I think this will flip in the next [few] years.”
Providing students with the opportunity to explore socially responsible gaming is a great way to spur their interest in this niche area. Collegeology, a project led by the Game Innovation Lab under the Interactive Media Lab, the Rossier School of Education and the Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis, brings together faculty and students to develop games such as “Mission: Admission,” a Facebook game that teaches high school students strategies and skills they need to apply to college.
For people who are simply interested in playing games and seeing what the socially responsible gaming trend is all about, Grantoo will be holding large-scale tournaments every two weeks with smaller tournaments hosted throughout the week. Users can easily view the tournament countdown on Grantoo’s sign-in page on Grantoo.org to see when the next tournament will be, and the company will expand to mobile and smartphones as well.
If you’re going to spend time playing games, why not spend it doing something good?

Commencement is almost here. It’s a time to see family, take pictures and get nostalgic with your classmates.
Of course, it’s also a time to be self-centered. Commencement ultimately exists to celebrate individual achievement. And, hey, if you’re managing to actually graduate — whether it’s in three years or six — you deserve to pat yourself on the back. You deserve to imagine a flashy future for yourself, possibly a future in which a campus building is in your name.
Jonathan Zhang | Daily Trojan
Though this attitude is excusable at commencement, it’s best not to carry it beyond May 11. Individual achievement is important, but we could all use a healthy dose of collectivism.
The official definition of collectivism is fairly neutral: According to Merriam-Webster, collectivism entails “emphasis on collective rather than individual action or identity.”
Nevertheless, in America, collectivism conjures strange and unpleasant images, most of which are probably related to communist Soviet Union.
The United States is one of the most staunchly individualistic countries in the world. Here, we’re taught to stand out and get ahead — preferably on our own, you freeloader. We learn that if we don’t speak up and advocate for our interests, our go-getting peers will leave us in the dust.
Colleges certainly push this mentality. I’m sure commencement speaker Christiane Amanpour will tell us to be leaders. I can’t imagine she’ll tell us to blend in.
In collectivist societies, however, people who focus too much on their own wants and needs are seen as nuisances. The group’s goals reign supreme.
It’s difficult to imagine that mentality at USC. Here, we’re encouraged to highlight our differences and pursue ambitious goals. The more we look like special snowflakes, the happier the administration is. Few of us are going to become hardcore collectivists anytime soon.
But we have to remember that people rarely make it alone. You don’t exist in a vacuum; like it or not, you’re defined by the groups to which you belong. In fact, a collectivist would say that without the group, the self is practically nothing.
As members of an individualistic society, we love heroes. We eat up stories that focus on one man’s struggle or one woman’s brilliant idea. But when everyone tries to lead, there’s no one left to work behind the scenes.
It’s tempting to chase the spotlight, but I firmly believe that the most valuable goal isn’t to be seen as great — it’s to do great things, no matter who gets recognized in the end. Should the time be right, the spotlight will find you on its own.

There are two evil forms of collectivism, both very much alive and well in today’s America: one is enforced collectivism (taxes and regulations are common forms of this) and the other, perhaps partly a response to the first, is the “herd mentality,” in which anyone not conforming to the dominant opinions is condemned, ostracized, marginalized, even persecuted.
Questioning the dominant version of the Holocaust story, for example, is an excellent way to fall victim to a pernicious herd mentality that has been purposefully drilled into all us pursuant – in many states and countries – to LAW that requires that it be crammed down the throats of hapless schoolchildren.
A nasty correlate of collectivism can be intolerance (of those daring to think for themselves, and perhaps even express those thoughts).
But the post also points up valuable truths: if NONE of us will follow (rather than lead), the result must be chaos. For my part, I’ve chosen to follow a small but growing cadre of writers and researchers seeking the truths that underlie the Holocaust legend. Ultimately, inspiring leadership is not possible without inspired followership.
And THAT is getting harder and harder as enforcement of collectivism expands.
Tempting trap to fall into.  However, this is America.  We stand for the values of staunch individualism, self-reliance, and hard-work and virtue as a path to personal success.  But nice try.  See you in the winner’s circle.

“Liberal” and “conservative” are two labels that dominate our daily lives, whether on news programs or in conversations with fellow students. Although the terms are usually associated with political leanings, a recent article  by Chris Mooney from The Washington Post suggests these terms reach beyond that to reveal something about the way we think and act.
Mooney argues that one’s political ideology reflects one’s personal psychology. Unfortunately, his article is a gross oversimplification of reality.
irene Wang | Daily Trojan 
“Liberals and conservatives don’t just vote differently, they think differently,”Mooney said.
According to the article, liberals are more open-minded than conservatives. They possess an “openness to experience” that makes them more willing to try new things, whether it be books, films or ideas. Conservatives are characterized as resistant and unmovable.
There are, however, obvious cracks in Mooney’s argument. As a self-proclaimed “liberal,” he holds an inherent bias that causes his pop psychology to lose its validity.
Pop psychology such as this is appealing because it offers packaged explanations for what otherwise remains mysterious.
Why do we behave and think differently? Mooney’s piece only serves to pacify a desire to have general formulas for complex human differences. We want our information presented to us on a silver platter, neatly tied up with a ribbon. The unexplainable is unnerving. Therefore, by defining political ideology so rigidly, by translating a type of political thought into a type of person, Mooney only polarizes the two sides further, satisfying stereotypes and making dangerous generalizations.
The same sweeping generalizations have been used in other pop psychology studies — most notably those concerning race and intelligence. For example, in 2007, Slate reported “an IQ deficit for Africans relative to Europeans” and “Europeans relative to Asians.” Who can say, however, that the data of these tests is reliable? Considering the size of the test pool, the validity of the test itself, and other complex cultural or environmental factors, it has long been established that intelligence is nearly, if not completely, impossible to measure.
Generalizations based on unreliable test scores only put up more boundaries, instill more bias and allow the superficial satisfaction that can come from being able to group people into neat sections.
Pop psychology is dangerous because it so often amplifies our biases.
How can we assume that there isn’t a great number of open-minded conservatives, close-minded liberals or even that both sides can be open-minded and close-minded at once to various aspects, aspects so various that they cannot be measured?
By attempting to put people within defined boundaries, we might feel a temporary relief.
In the end, however, the effects of such simple thinking will hurt us more than we might think.

While saving space for bikes, USC should keep its charm.
What makes you proud to call yourself a Trojan? Is it our exceptional academic or athletic rankings? Is it the unique oasis of the campus?
Is our Trojan pride being run over by bikes? It is time that the conversation regarding bicycles be at the forefront of everyone’s mind.
The biggest issue is in settling a question of long-standing importance. How much of our foundation as a campus are we willing to put on the line?
USC should not lose sight of its history and what we are. We are a potentially idyllic physical setting for a campus. We have a tiny, calm, English garden in one of the world’s largest metro areas. With 1,400 new trees and the hardscaping of both 34th Sreet and McClintock Avenue, the challenge is enhancing USC’s reputation as a safe and beautiful pedestrian oasis.
We have to enhance our physical aesthetics so everyone can be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, ambitious — and not be run over by bikes. We need a bike plan that is simple and forward-thinking, one that doesn’t leave us looking like every other state school with bike paths cutting through campus.
In the academic core, at the heart of campus, bikes should be welcomed and encouraged on McClintock Avenue and 34th Street during business hours.
We should make bikes a priority inside the academic core with McClintock as the north/south axis and 34th Street as the east/west axis. This means creating 24/7 bike lanes on these streets, moving trams to the outside edge of campus and keeping other vehicles to a minimum.
We should clean up, redesign and repurpose the McClintock entrance. This should become the primary bike and pedestrian entrance. Cars should not be allowed to use this entrance between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.
We should not be placing a 24/7 Bike Freeway on Trousdale Parkway or Downey Way. This would change the garden aesthetic that matches our learning environment. During non-business hours, cyclists will ride everywhere — including up and down Trousdale — anyway.
Most importantly, except on designated 24/7 bike lanes, we must create a dismount zone in the academic core during business hours.
It is time we returned faith and courage to the hands of the students. When all is said and done, we are all here for one thing: our education. Provide us with a safe and peaceful learning environment that is worthy of our status and one that will encourage the scholarly conversations that will prepare us for the working world.

A barrage of hazing horror stories began with the death of George Desdunes, a Cornell University sophomore who was reportedly forced to drink so much alcohol that his blood alcohol content reached the level of .409.
Then came Robert Champion, a Florida A&M student who died after being violently hazed by his fellow band members.
These young men are just two of the countless college students who are bullied into submission — and sometimes even death — to gain the respect and trust of their peers.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Some organizations might call it bonding, but to the rest of the world, it’s hazing.
Rolling Stone magazine recently ran an eight-page spread detailing the hazing activities of fraternities and sororities at Dartmouth University.
Andrew Lohse, a student and former fraternity member, decided to speak publicly about his experiences, incurring the wrath of many of his fraternity brothers.
In the article, Lohse discussed how he and his pledge brothers were forced to eat “vomlets” — you fill in the blank — and swim in kiddie pools filled with urine, sperm, vomit and feces, not to mention all-night drinking binges and activities involving kidnapping.
Lohse’s story is not an isolated incident. It’s playing out across the country. Too many of our nation’s universities and colleges are guilty of some form of hazing.
When we think of hazing, the worst possibilities come to mind. In fact, a common misconception is that hazing only counts when it involves physical harm.
Hazing is better defined as forcing anyone to do anything that they are not comfortable doing in the name of fitting in with the group.
Many of us forget the emotional scars that uncomfortable activity can brand us with.
Less significant incidents, such as midnight workouts or naked runs, might seem harmless and funny.
Unfortunately, if we don’t live by a zero-tolerance policy on hazing, then the more dangerous activities will continue unabated.
USC hasn’t had a hazing-related death in recent memory. The administration does a relatively good job of policing the school’s organizations.
Nevertheless, many instances at USC could be considered hazing.
Whether it’s in a frat during the bi-annual “Hell Week” or initiation into any other student organization, in order to be “in” you have to go through such rituals.
This vicious cycle will continue until colleges, including USC, attempt to put an end to it.
As a member of the Greek community, I hope that one day such instances of hazing are rendered nonexistent.
To get to that point, we need to stop giving slaps on the wrists and enforce punishments on those who harm others.
The university should take a stronger hand in educating students going through recruitment, so that they can more easily distinguish between what’s acceptable and what’s inexcusable.
A brotherhood, sisterhood, band or club is no excuse for physical or emotional harm. True bonding is an act of support, friendship and love. Students should be able to have friends that don’t abuse them as part of the “system.”
George Desdunes and Robert Champion got lost in this same abusive system. Because so few people speak out about it, their parents had to plan their funerals before they got to see them graduate.
We must take action before a tragedy occurs, before a Trojan is a victim of a prank gone wrong.

If the government takes my money I do want issues addressed and it does not include helping me to raise children to become strong through hazing.   There is so much AIR  blown when young adults cannot find a new meaning in this century to value what it takes to become real  men and women.  God Bless the child who has a parent who thinks they are independently strong because they have parental support with hazing.  Try surviving and being great with out hazing, I know it’s not easy, but many people do it every day.
I think the other side of the issue to consider is the belief that these young people have that in order to belong to a group they must endure dangerous, degrading activities, especially when these activities have no connection to the purpose or mission of the organization.  What leads students in junior high to believe that in order to be part of the team (whatever team that may be) they must somehow be ridiculed or physically/mentally/emotionally assaulted and that if they don’t successfully “endure” that process, they are not “worthy” or “accepted”?  How can we teach them self acceptance and self worth so that they don’t feel as though they must “endure” in order to be respected?
I think telling people to “man up” without defining the right way to do that is how hazing is propagated in the first place.  While I can agree with the sentiment that we are “coddling” the younger generations more so than in the past, members of those generations are actually searching for an arena in which to “man up” and prove themselves (women are not excluded from this).  In the past, “manning up” meant doing hard work for the right reason.  Have we somehow lost that definition?  How can we teach our young men and women how to prove themselves by doing hard work for the RIGHT reasons, instead of some silly activity that doesn’t provide value to the world?
Dang typos…
Man…of we have your way…Our young adults will not know how to work or sacrifice for anything. Your winey article is and example of what’s crushing this country. We are telling our young adults “you shouldn’t have to endure any kind of activity that is uncomfortable to join a group or organization. We forget these people are adults…no one can MAKE anyone drink or do something they don’t want to do. That would be a choice of the individual. We are taking away the premise of individual responsibility, and allowing blame of everyone and everything else instead of holding a person responsible for THEIR INDIVIDUAL choice. If a fraternity member physically forces a pledge to do something, that is assault by law, and it is up to the INDIVDUAL to make the choice to press charges, or not to. Depends on what their priority is, joining a club or fraternity, or charging someone with a crime. I went through certain hazing with the armed forces, then a fraternity, so when it came to the same activity for football, I said no, because I felt I had done enough of that type of activity already. We also have to acknowledge that the pledges KNOW what’s coming their way when joining a fraternity, and by pledging, are making a CONCIOUS decision to be involved with that type of activity. You might want to be treated like a little helpless child with mental toughness, but I don’t, as I am raising my kids the same way. Brotherhood is a valuable thing, and should be earned. Parents need to raise their kids to be tough, and be able to defend themselves both physically, and mentally. They should be able to say know when they have reached their limits like I did, and like I have seen many others do. Stop with the wining and depending on govt to protect you from everything.
If the government takes my money, I  always want issues addressed (don’t sit on my money).  God bless the child who has a parent who believes hazing makes a person stronger.  It is really very sad when in this century we have so much available to us by using our intelligence we choose to focus only on the physical destruction.   Unfortunately, it may  be difficult to understand how to become a real man or woman with out hazing.  If you think hazing helps you to become a strong person, try maturing with out it,  not easy, many have become very strong individuals with the absence of hazing.
It hasn’t been been proven that the Cornell student “was forced to drink so much alcohol that his blood alcohol content reached the level of .409.”
There are allegations that the fraternity brother had consumed considerable alcohol before he was “kidnapped” by  the pledges. 
Hazing is stupid and masochistic and does nothing to make a person a better fraternity member.  They’re the most fundamental reasons to get rid of it.
I don’t know how many times this needs to be said, but MAN UP.  The woosification of American society nowadays is pitiful.  That is the essence of hazing – man up.  Overcome the physical, mental, and emotional stresses placed upon you and become a stronger and tougher person.  
That being said, there is no excuse for disgusting, degrading acts against another human being.  These acts have no purpose and are destructive.  There is a clear line, don’t cross it.

Paramount Pictures is currently in negotiations with Protozoa Pictures on The General, a film regarding the life of George Washington, for which Darren Aronofsky will serve as producer and director.
Paramount Pictures currently has a first-look deal with the production company. If the studio can’t reach a deal, however, other studios will have the opportunity to jump in.
The screenplay for the film is written by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage. Variety reports that the film is “more of an Unforgiven-like tale rather than a straight historical drama.” The film could possibly be an examination of the first president’s life during his time as a General during the American Revolution.
Aronofsky is known for navigating between diverse genres, but it’s gotten to the point that any project that has his name attached sounds intriguing.
The filmmaker is coming off his success of Black Swan, which grossed $329 million and scored him an Oscar nomination for Best Director.
The filmmaker is currently preparing his passion project, Noah, which stars Russell Crowe. The project has long been on the director’s mind, and after the critical and commercial success of Black Swan, production on the film has finally come together. Noah has a budget in the range of $150 million. That’s quite an increase from his previous film, which had a reported budget of $13 million. It’s clear, however, that he is now thinking ahead, onto projects of a bigger scale where he can employ his artistic vision.
The release date for Noah was recently announced as March 28, 2014.

Over the past 10 years that Maroon 5 has existed, one thing hasn’t changed. They are still dedicated to writing about love and losing it.
“Payphone,” the band’s first single from its upcoming album, Overexposed, was released on Monday.
It begins with Adam Levine’s distinct voice and flows into a groove with a laid-back drumbeat. The piano is very subtle in the background, allowing the backbeat to drive the song as Levine sings a story about a relationship that fell apart.
Consistent beats and synthesizer is becoming a lot more evident in Maroon 5’s music.
In 2002 when the band’s first album, Songs by Jane, came out, its music was very organic. More recently, with songs like “Moves Like Jagger” and Levine’s appearance on Gym Class Heroes’ “Stereo Hearts,” the touches of soul from earlier albums is missing.
Although Maroon 5 had plenty of radio play in the past, its music seems to have more pop and mainstream influences, leading them to radio domination.
The band’s more frequent collaborations with pop artists and rappers have a lot to contribute to this.
Wiz Khalifa is able to expose an entirely different audience to Maroon 5’s music. Out of the blue, he makes a quick appearance in “Payphone,” assumingly ranting away about his last failed relationship.
None of those changes have hindered the band from creating catchy and solid hits. Although most of today’s generation has probably never used a payphone, many people will be able to relate to the new single with its well-crafted lyrics.
While the band’s sound is a little different, so are its band members.
The band’s keyboardist Jesse Carmichael recently went on hiatus from the band, but PJ Morton has been filling in for him.
The new album, Overexposed, is set to be released on June 26 of this year.

A DPS-involved shooting occurred on West 30th Street near the intersection of Shrine Place after officers confronted a robbery suspect on Wednesday at 12:40 a.m., according to Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Kristy Pyke | Daily Trojan
[Update 3:11 a.m.] Two male and two female students were walking westbound on 28th Street from Figueroa Street when a black male suspect approached them and demanded their property, according to the security officer standing outside Pi Beta Phi sorority house on The Row. The females gave their property to the suspect, who ran through a parking lot to 30th Street, where he was confronted by DPS officers. The two male students ran after the suspect and helped direct nearby LAPD officers to the scene. Another suspect was waiting in a nearby car.
According to Carlisle, DPS confronted the suspect after the suspect demanded students’ property and displayed a handgun near 28th and Figueroa streets. The suspect sustained a non-life-threatening gunshot wound during the confrontation. No students or DPS officers were harmed.
[Update: 9:40 a.m.] The suspect was a black male described as 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds, according to the DPS incident resolution. After a DPS officer became aware of the situation, he chased the suspect on foot and cornered him on 30th Street with the assistance of LAPD officers. The DPS officer fired one shot at the suspect’s leg. The suspect’s handgun and the student’s property were recovered.
The Los Angeles Police Department took the suspect into custody and is investigating the incident. The LAPD also set up a command post near the scene of the altercation.
DPS declared the area safe at 2 a.m.

It is incredible to me that this thug tried to rob these 4 students today. Doesn’t he realize that cops and campus police will be extra vigilant after the killings here last week? Are the criminals here that brazen, stupid, or desperate? I guess he’s all of the above!
Did I miss something? What happened to … “Another suspect was waiting in a nearby car” It is not clear if they caught that person as well????
I heard the guys that chased the armed robber were Pikes.
No dude, that was Teague and his bros chasing that chump!
Wow Parent of Freshman, if you are going to base your entire perception and the reputation of an institution on two isolated incidents without taking into account all of the good that this school has to offer, than maybe it’s best if your kid doesn’t attend SC.
Praise God for DPS
Who else thinks the violence around campus has gotten out of control? Anyone want to help start an initiative or some sort of campaign to call for increased security near campus? Countless cases of burglaries, harassment, theft, public indecency, machete-weilding attacks on students on the row, sexual assaults, and now even the deaths of 2 innocent students and NOTHING has changed. The fact of the matter is nothing will ever change until students, and our tuition-paying parents demand it.
Actually crime is down per the FBI stats.  It’s just when something happens near us we perceive it to be more.
My kid is admitted, we visited the campus at April 10, 2012, the day right before the 2 Chinese kids got killed. we spent a few hours walking around in campus and outsie the campus and left LA back to SF bay area. I was shocked when I started google USC and tried to do some deep resarch on USC in the early morning, April 11. my kid refused to talk about the USC acceptance. one of my kid’s high school classmates visited the campus earlier and stayed in the boy’s dorm for one night. he said that there was a party going on all night long right next to dorm and people drunk and vomitted everywhere in the shared dorm area. 
now what can we do? turn down the admit offer, that’s it.
Hey Max, 
If USC is so safe, why don’t you live down here in this terrifc neighborhood in this terrific off-campus housing, you don’t provide,  surrounded by thugs?
Hey Max, are you there? Anything at all to say about any of this? Max?
Great job DPS!
I am waiting for Al Sharpton to be outraged that a law enforcement officer shot a black man. Retarded, politically correct stances are going to be why crime is never taken seriously in LA – and that is why students will have to be the victims of that retarded policy. The only reason many people with means do not live in this area is because it is a ghetto war zone
After reading this thread, I say if Pepperdine was able to move its campus to Malibu to get away from the crimes, let’s start a donation drive to move USC to Rancho Palos Verdes so that the students could be safe and Nikias could have a really nice short commute as well! :-)
Shoot to kill period.
South Central is a war zone full of thugs. The only real solution is to militarize the area surrounding USC. Security cameras at every street corner, DPS/LAPD patrols with semi-automatic weapons, clear and enforced boundaries between USC and the jungle around it. Keep the animals out, keep USC students safe.
This guy was from Compton.  Leave the local residents out of it.
Great job DPS!
Sounds like DPS needs a little time on the practice range.  LAPD never shoots someone in the leg or below the waist for that matter.   Nevertheless, I’d buy that guy a yaeger shot at the 90.
In the last month, I was assaulted by a crackhead at a Mobil on figueroa, recently had to call police because a man was beating his girlfriend right past the 9-0 (non-USC), and then the callous murders of Ming and Ying, and now this Compton gang member coming and brazenly robbing these students… a lot of people don’t realize the amount of crime that happens around here because DPS only sends out certain alerts… (if any!!!)- I sure didn’t get a Trojan alert about this… just the incident resolution…if they sent an email for all the crimes that happened around campus…. our emails would be overloaded…
The Mobil on Fig and Adams?  What time of day was that?  
I go to Popeyes across the street a lot, and there are always LAPD officers or Sherff’s deputies hanging out there.  Cops love their Popeyes too, I guess.
There’s an Expo Line stop near there also.  We can’t have crackheads assaulting folks once the Expo Line is up and running.
I am deeply saddened by the tragic deaths and that you were assaulted, but how ignorant can you be to assume that the guy was a crackhead and that the other guy is a Compton Gang member? I’m sorry, but being a student at USC you should be smarter than that. Things happen…how bad the area surrounding USC is is no secret! It’s people like you who give us a bad name.
alright PC police!! cant  wait till a crackhead assaults you so you can fight him off with social awareness!
“how had the area surrounding USC is is no secret!”
Unfortunately for students from out of the LA area, USC has done a great job of hiding that secret.
Go here for more info – name of the suspect is Jeremy Hendricks, a well known Compton gang member out on parole.
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-robbery-.html
(1) It’s pretty easy to tell when someone is a crackhead.
(2) The LA Times determined that the individual shot last night was from a Compton gang.
I’m a student at USC, and I’m pretty smart. You, on the other hand, are not.
Won’t somebody please think of the crackheads?!
What are these kids doing walking the streets of LA so late at night??? People need to remember….”USC is in the middle of the ‘hood”….use common sense people.
It’s common for USC students to still be out late at night – sometimes it’s because we are studying and sometimes it’s because we’re partying.
According to the news report, Wu and Gu were returning home from studying in the library when they were killed.
It’s just not reasonable to expect students to always stay in the DPS patrolled area and go home by 9.
Its dumb to enter the DPS patrolled areas to commit a crime.  Your chances of success drop considerably.
Unfortunately criminals are not generally known to be smart people!
Would you also blame the victim and ask a girl why she was wearing a short skirt when she was raped?

See what I mean? In Los Angeles, our politicians are so afraid of being called a racist if they are hard on crime that they have to pretend gangbangers are good people with bad PR. Slepp well parents – your children are living in a neighborhood infested with criminals and the City of LA is in no hurry to act on it – since if they act on it they have to admit there is a real problem in the first place. Also – just go to the Megan’s Law website and see how many registered sex offenders live in walking distance to the campus. I guess this area is home to a high concentration of sex offenders as well as violent criminals.
There are numerous registered sex offenders who live within walking distance of any campus, landmark, or building. There are several in Beverly Hills and Hollywood as well.
Have you seen the disparity in the number of sex offenders by USC as opposed to say UCLA? How about Pepperdine or UC Santa Barbara?
Once again, some guy who’s not actually from the neighborhood.
These knuckleheads must view USC students as ATM machines.  Just drive north several miles and make a withdrawal.
LAPD/USC need to figure out how to make CRIMINALS feel unsafe in the area.
“The suspect was a black male described as 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds”
Well I guess that narrows things down a bit…
Fight on DPS
Wow, if you guys think the area around USC is unsafe I would hate to see you in a part of Los Angeles that is actually bad. Take a look at a crime map before you run your mouth all over the place.
Crime map shows 99 murders in the USC neighborhood during the last 5 years:
http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/search/?address=2700%20Raymond%20Ave,%20Los%20Angeles,%20CA%2090007,%20USA&lat=34.0309102&lng=-118.2980541&g=Geocodify
Crime map shows 3 murders during the same time frame in Rancho Palos Verdes where Nikias has his house:
http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/rancho-palos-verdes/
The USC neighborhood has even more killings than other trouble prone L.A. neighborhoods such as Gardena and Compton!
The crime statistics shows USC neighborhood is dangerous!
That map extends as far North as Olympic and Normandie.
I’d like to see the crime rates within USC’s patrol area, which I think is roughly the area USC folks are referring to when they think of USC’s neighborhood.
Here’s a map of the neighborhood that USC is actually located in:  http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/university-park/
4 murders in the past 5 years; 1 more than Palos Verdes.
USC’s neighborhood:
http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/neighborhood/university-park/crime/
Over the last three months, University Park averaged 1.8 violent crimes and 20.5 property crimes per week.
Compare to Rancho Dominguez:
Over the last six months, the rate of 467.2 crimes per 10,000 people is higher than in nearby Carson and Compton.
Compare to Compton:
Over the last six months, the rate of 180.3 crimes per 10,000 people is higher than in nearby Paramount, Carson, Willowbrook, Lynwood and East Compton and lower than Rancho Dominguez and West Compton.
So before you throw around the word “ghetto” like you know what you’re talking about, dig a little bit deeper. Also, I don’t understand how Nikias’s home has anything to do with it. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t live on campus either. Housing costs are exorbitant, unless you like paying $1500 per month to live in a closet, and the noise levels are ridiculous. Most people who live near campus could easily afford to live further away but choose to live within walking distance.
Your USC map and it’s crime statistics are the PR garbage that USC like to throw out to the outside world.
Guess what, many students like me live and have to walk outside that little DSP patrolled area!!!
I think Wu and Gu was killed at 2717 Raymond Ave where she lived, outside of your little map!
So I guess their murders shouldn’t be counted according to you!
Disgusting PR!
Furthermore:
http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Oct30/0,4670,CityCrimeListGlance,00.html
Los Angeles is #250, a decent spot for a city of its size. Compton is #368.
My map was a response to the Palos Verdes map.  USC students have chosen to live west of Vermont for the cheaper rents, and USC has followed by bringing more security resources to those areas.
But the fact remains that those areas are not as safe as the areas patrolled by USC.
I live west of campus and I feel much safer walking there at night than north of campus. I feel safer walking around USC at night than I do anywhere else in Los Angeles. There are security guards on just about every street corner and DPS patrols a fairly large area.
If USC students had been attacked in any way in Beverly Hills or Downtown, would people still blame DPS/USC for not patrolling a large enough area?
Anonymous – Your map and it’s statistics also conveniently left out area where many USC students live and walk.
Again Wu and Gu killings would not be counted in your statistics because it occurred outside of your little DPS patrolled area!
Again PR whitewash!
Also just because people choose to live around the USC neighborhood for convenience, are you saying they deserve to be robbed and murdered?
Where administrators live is a sign whether they themselves believe the PR garbage they throw out to the students and their parents.
No one deserves to be robbed and/or killed.  But some areas are safer (and more expensive) than others.
Believing that the USC area is safe and wanting to live in a giant house overlooking the Pacific aren’t mutually exclusive.
However, it would be interesting to know whether Max Nikias’s daughters lived in the neighborhood while they were students at USC.
I like how “Anonymous” has mastered the art of sophistry. Nice job comparing DTLA and Beverly Hills to Raymond & 27th (which is only 1 mi from Gate 5 or 6).
I wonder where the suspect is from?  Seems that prior crimes involved people not from the neighborhood, but from places like Signal Hill (Long Beach) and Inglewood.
The neighborhood is unsafe because criminals think they can target USC students without much repercussion.
This isn’t the first time people got robbed on the row.  But it’s the first time I’ve ever heard of the perp getting shot.  Hopefully it sends a message; too bad criminals aren’t apt to listen.
10 years ago the most a strong arm robber would get is a backpack full of books and maybe a phone. Now they know most SC students are carrying around a few hundreds if not thousands of dollars of electronic equipment. We are going to see more and more of these strong arm robberies unless USC and the City of Los Angeles are not afraid to stop being so politically correct and deal with this issue head on. USC is so afraid to call out the truth that we are living in the middle of the ghetto. I do not care how many frozen yogurt shops you have – we are in the ghetto. 
I swear, LA and USC treats crime like a Brinks/Broadview Home Security commercial. Of course they pretend all dangerous criminals look like young, white good looking out of work actors…
The fact a Trojan alert did not go out last night is ridiculous. How many students might have avoided the area entirely if they received an alert. USC is obviously afraid to issue such an alert because they do not want to contribute to more PR about this area being a dangerous location.
Excellent point, Ras.  Downtown has seen a recent spike in cellphone-related crimes.
http://blogdowntown.com/2012/04/6693-cellphone-thefts-up-32-in-downtown-compared
To clarify, I think your first 2 sentences are excellent.  Not sure what to make of the rest of your psot.
I’m really frightened by all the crimes around the USC neighborhood. 
I guess I should’ve paid more attention to the surrounding area when I visited the campus after I was accepted by USC. 
Though some of these neighborhood houses look historic, many of the houses have metal bars on the windows and doors! Now I realize that they are there for good reasons!
When Nikias was promoted, USC gave him a place in San Marino so he didn’t have to commute from his home in Rancho Palos Verdes.
I think USC should make Nikias live in the neighborhood where all of us poor graduate students are forced to live.
Maybe then Nikias will be more motivated to provide more housing and better security for the students!
I came here to study but I am scared and distracted by the constant Trojan alerts and crimes.
This is not why my parents sent me here to USC!
I think we students deserve a safer environment to pursue our study.
You make an excellent point – I wish USC would publish stats on how many of the Faculty and Admin actually lives in the North University Park neighborhood.
Yea I think USC administrators are a bunch of hypocrites! 
They tell us that the USC neighborhood is safe for students!
Well if it’s so safe why doesn’t Nikias live here too!
After all, his commute would be even shorter!
Stuck at USC, I completely agree with you.  Graduate students have had a huge role in making many of the discoveries fueled USC’s rapid rise in the ratings.  Many of them are brilliant students from outside the US that Nikias and other USC administrators recruit to come here.  USC needs to accept some responsibility for the safety of these graduate students. If USC encouraged a developer to build a very nice high rise apartment building across the street from USC and then partially subsidized the rent for those graduate students who are not wealthy, would grad students live there?  This could be a highrise for grad students only and it would be very nice.  USC grad students need attractive and safe housing very near the labs and libraries where they often work late into the night.  I can’t think of a better use for a small part of USC’s massive $3.23 billion endowment that taking care of its graduate students.
The two shootings couldn’t come at a worse time for the university- just before the May 1 acceptance deadline . There goes the yield.
Are you kidding me?
This is a war zone!
you have never actually been to a real war zone, have you…
DPS should get a medal.
The message went out loud and clear.
Even the dumbest of the dumb can understand the message of a gunshot hitting a street thug.
Unless the university puts a fence around the area this kind of thing will happen on ocassion. The school is in the ‘hood. You can pretend its not but it is. Now that some white kids from the Row were threatened the school will take more serious preventive action.
Touche
We have come a long way to improve the conditions at USC and the surrounding area. We are not going to stop now! What are we going to do? pack our bags and leave to Malibu, just like Peperdine did? The time is right now to dismantle gang and criminals in the area. I would get a court order to bring the National Guard to search every home for weapons in all of south central simultaneously, a raid. Install cameras in every intersection, we have to fight fire with fire, If our students are going to be unsafe we rather pack our bags and leave to Malibu.
HAHAHAHAHAH YEAH CHARLIE! Please, just pick up the Galen Center and your recently renovated campus to the beach….what a joke of a Trojan you are fersure.
Perhaps USC could buy up a couple of centrally located blocks in the ghetto and pay for the building of a huge LAPD substation and well-equipped police academy?
well they ran after him?? what a bunch of idiots.. Must have been some poor little kid, he didn’t have a weapon on him and they shot him?
According to the article…
“According to Carlisle, DPS confronted the suspect after the suspect demanded students’ property and displayed a handgun near 28th and Figueroa streets.”
So he did have a weapon on him.
Are you serious? It clearly states that he displayed a handgun.
This proves how great the DPS is? What world are u living in Mr. Human? All this proves is that we live a in a little island of denial in one of the poorest parts of the city and most people would rather do keg stands on the row than think about the more depressing reality outside our doors. Two killings and an attempted armed robbery in one week? Yeah, nothing to see here, just move along. Sheesh!
well considering i was at the 90 tonight and walk along these streets quite often, safe is the last thing i feel right now. come on usc. two kids were shot last week, none of us knew for six hours, and you still haven’t stepped up your notification system? what a joooke
if anything this proves how well DPS is able to respond and the presence they have that it was shut down and contained so quickly. Other criminals will hear about this and be discouraged from making such an attempt that will end poorly for them.
The unfortunate thing is that this is only going to add fuel to the claims that USC is unsafe.
serio
No trojan alert?  how can student live with no fear? that is so close to school!
And there is STILL yet to be a Trojan Alert?  This is absolutely ridiculous, this is the entire reason we have that system.
i think they probably haven’t sent one because the incident was contained and the shots were fired by DPS officers…once the suspect was detained, the threat was over and there would be no reason to notify students to avoid the area or whatever. i am sure they will send out an update/alert about it later, but they don’t usually issue the immediate warnings unless there is a current threat (like if there was an ongoing gas leak or an earthquake with possible building damage or an incident where the shooter had gotten away/was still on the streets).
although i am sure the people living on 30th would have liked an update/explanation about what was happening outside…
28th and Figeuroa = The 90.  This just got real.
[…] Four USC students were stopped on the streets by the suspect who displayed a hand gun and demanded their property. The two females in the group turned over their property while the two male students started chasing the suspect through a parking lot, according to a report in The Daily Trojan. […]
