USC entered last weekend’s two-game slate of home contests at Galen Center in the midst of a season long four-game losing streak. The Trojans looked to get back on track against UC Berkeley Friday and against the No. 2 ranked Stanford Cardinal Sunday. However, they came out extending their losing streak to six. 
USC went into Friday’s game against Cal with a record of 9-9 while the Golden Bears had a 9-5 record and had not played a game since Jan. 21. Friday’s matchup against Cal was close as USC trailed 28-25 at halftime and trailed by 5 points heading into the fourth quarter. 
With just nine seconds left in the game, it was tied at 59 and Golden Bears junior guard Leilani McIntosh hit what ended up being a game winning 3-pointer with four seconds left. The Trojans got the ball back for one last possession to try to tie the game, but USC turned it over before they could attempt to get a shot off.
The Trojans struggled shooting the ball in their previous four-game road trip, and although they only shot 36% from the floor in Friday’s game, it was higher than Cal’s 32% shooting from the floor. 
The Trojans also shot higher from the 3-point range than the Golden Bears did — USC shot 40% from three compared to 30% from Cal. However, USC did lose the turnover battle 13 to 11 and got out-rebounded 41 to 40.
The marquee matchup between USC sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins and Cal freshman guard Jayda Curry turned out to be as good as advertised. 
Jenkins had a career high 26 points on 52% shooting from the floor, and Curry led the Golden Bears in scoring, with 21 points after only scoring two first half points. Jenkins also displayed her abilities on the defensive end as she had 3 blocked shots. USC ended up losing to UC Berkeley for the first time since January 2019.
Sunday’s game against the Cardinal was not as close of a game for the Trojans. Stanford entered the game with a 17-3 record, and 9 wins came against Pac-12 teams. USC only found itself down 5 points against the Cardinal in the second quarter, but Stanford went on a 13-0 run in the final 5:15 of the quarter to push the lead to 37-19 at half.
From there, the Cardinal never looked back and went on to win the game 83-57. 
The Trojans had three players in double figures scoring-wise, with Jenkins leading the way with 20 points, while sophomore forward Cameron Brink led Stanford in scoring with a season-high 26 points along with 14 rebounds. 
The Cardinal shot 43% from the field and 38% from three compared to 33% from the field and 14% from three for USC. Stanford also won the turnover battle 17 to 15 and dominated the glass as they outrebounded the Trojans 48 to 34.
As USC’s losing streak continues, the Trojans look ahead to a three-game road trip beginning Wednesday against Utah. The game will tip off at 1 p.m.

When Joyce Ni was 15, she went on a train ride with her dad. During the three-day long ride from Los Angeles to Chicago, she finally got the chance to talk to her dad and she began to view him differently. Ni learned more about his passions and his dreams. 
In a class where pitching a movie was the final assignment, Ni (a junior majoring in business administration with an emphasis in cinematic arts) who worked as a production assistant for the film, presented an idea that was essentially, at its core, “girl goes on a trip with her dad. They realize they’re more similar than they ever thought they were.” 
In “Paper UFOs, Li Wei, the father, was an artist who gave up his dream to move to the U.S. This decision affected how he raised Jennie, his daughter, a student interested in the arts, said Stanley Lin, the film’s director of photography, co-screenwriter and executive producer.
When Jennie studied film against her father’s wishes, it created a rift between the pair. The film intends to reconcile the desires of both and start a conversation between the two generations, said Lin.  
“Paper UFOs” is an independent short film that is “a character exploration between a second-generation Asian American daughter and her first-generation Chinese father,” Lin said, and a senior majoring in cinema and media studies and business administration.   
Although “Paper UFOs” is a fictional narrative, it is overarchingly based on universal sentiments experienced by many immigrant parents and their children.
 “For a lot of second-generation Asian children, a lot of our parents had to give up an, arguably, more comfortable and more familiar life in their home country… to secure a higher potential for financial security,” Lin said. “When you’re in an environment in which you have to fight all the time just for the basics… you start having to sacrifice some of your passions.” 
Ni didn’t have much hope for her story to immediately manifest into anything more significant. However, the Chinese American Student Association requested to write a play based on her narrative, which then transformed into a screenplay written by Lin and Sharon Park, which helped bring the story to life. 
Juliette Lin, a 2017 alumna who majored in business cinematic arts, said she left the entertainment industry in college after feeling burnt out because of a lack of Asian American representation both in front of and behind the camera. But, with the rise in content that isn’t pigeon-holed for just Asian American consumption, Lin said she has more hope and wears the label with pride.
The intention of the film is to connect with a broader audience, but to the crew members the production process was also somewhat of a cathartic, healing process for many who were initially drawn to the story because of their own relatable experiences. 
“It was also really beautiful to see how everyone came together onto this project because of their own personal passion and because they’ve related so much,” said Michele Chung, one of the film’s producers. 
Chung, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, related her own connection to the project as a reconciliation. 
“The reconciliation that happened for me was realizing that I’m not the only one who has faced all these different troubles that the character goes through – it’s more so of a general story, ” said Chung. “It’s not just an Asian American story, but it’s for anyone who has immigrant parents or anyone who has parents who have sacrificed things for them.”
Although peppered with tangible narrative inspirations from films such as “Ladybird” or “The Half of It” and cinematographic inspirations such as “The Farewell,” the creatives behind the film intend for it to be cemented as something of its own. Fitting into the coming-of-age narrative arc, the film also differs from the familiar tropes that audiences know and love. Unlike the typical coming-of-age story that concentrates on the story of the child, “Paper UFOs” also highlights the growth that Li Wei goes through.
“You can almost see her dad almost come of age,” Ni said. “He realizes that he has his inner child and creativity, and they help each other through this experience.”
Although “Paper UFOs” looks to provide more representation for Asian Amerians, the film also looks to move beyond labels. 
“There will be a point in the future where we just call it a great film without labels,” Park said. “Right now is the opportunity to promote our story, and I think we can take advantage of this wave to get to that future sooner.” 
“Paper UFOs” does not have a finalized release date; it will be screened during CASA’s Chinese American Cultural Night, estimated to take place in late April. Park, who is taking the lead on the majority of the distribution plans, said they hope to have a film festival run where public screenings will be an option to gain a larger audience and more attention.

As the month of love begins, for many, against our will, stores are filled to the brim with chocolate truffles and conversation hearts that beg to be devoured during a rewatch of a favorite rom-com while we reflect on another February being single. As for those who have somehow found a relationship, you might also be in search of a movie or TV couple you and your partner can resonate with.
So, as you’re cuddling up with whoever or whatever, sit back, relax and enjoy everything from a true crime documentary to a wild new television show. For those looking for some romance, you just might find a few rom-coms sprinkled in for your viewing pleasure.
Netflix: 
“The Tinder Swindler” (Feb. 2)
What better way to celebrate love than to watch a documentary about an assumed rich guy, Simon Leviev, who seduces and swindles women around the world out of millions of dollars? This con man pretended to be the heir to multimillionaire Lev Leviev, aka the “King of Diamonds.” Documenting Leviev’s downfall, this highly anticipated true story is slated to be one of the best Netflix documentaries ever released. Watch these women join forces to hunt down this manipulative man and give him the karma he deserves. 
“About Time” (2013)
This surprising film has got to be one of the most underrated rom-coms to come out of the 2010’s. Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson have impeccable chemistry; the soundtrack warms your soul and, by the way, time travel is involved? What makes this movie so special is that, instead of a cheesy rom-com storyline, it prioritizes the importance of family and cherishing the little moments of day-to-day life. Also, as an added bonus, Margot Robbie serves as the brutal heartbreaker to Gleeson’s hopelessly romantic character. 
Amazon Prime: 
“Book of Love” (Feb. 4)
Sam Claflin (aka Finnick from “The Hunger Games” series) stars as a failing author from London whose novel, seemingly out of nowhere, becomes popular in Mexico. As he visits the country for a publicity tour, Claflin realizes that a native translator named Maria (Verónica Echegui) has converted his book into a spicy adult novel. After Clafin finds this out, his aloof publisher ropes the two into going on a book tour together, leaving plenty of time for them to get nice and cozy.
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” (February 18)
FINALLY, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” returns for its fourth season! Watch Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) battle with the struggle for creative license as a woman in the ’60s. After a heartbreaking loss involving Midge’s career as a comedian, the fourth season hints at some opportunity for revenge, generating an immense amount of excitement for fans. If you haven’t seen the first three seasons, do yourself a favor and binge them before the next release. 
Hulu: 
“Pam and Tommy” (February 2)
Calling all Sebastian Stan stans! “Pam and Tommy” tells the infamous story of how Tommy Lee (Sebastian Stan) and Pamela Anderson’s (Lily James) sex tape turned into one of the first celebrity tapes illegally leaked to the world as revenge porn. 
Stan and James’ uncanny transformations mixed with the ’90s nostalgia and the insane, realistic plot will take you for quite the ride. Not to mention, Seth Rogen rocks a mullet as the character of Rand Gauthier, the man who illegally stole and sold Tommy and Pamela’s sex tape. This representation of Lee and Anderson’s toxic relationship will either make you happy to be single or thankful for your current significant other. 
Disney+: 
“Never Been Kissed” (1999)
How could anyone make a streaming guide for the month of love without including a film with the iconic Drew Barrymore at least once? This late ’90s rom-com features the adorable character of Josie (Barrymore), a journalist who’s assigned to go undercover as a student at her old high school. While there, Josie falls for the starry-eyed English teacher (Michael Vartan). At the same time, she finds herself falling back into her old, nerdy high school persona and clashing with the popular kids against the wishes of her editor.

In an industry as large as fashion, drawing inspiration from other brands is bound to happen. Often, designers will announce collections that are inspired by, or pays homage to, other people and scenes. 
Sometimes, even major business decisions happen as a domino effect after one brand changes its company or values. For example, Dolce & Gabbana recently followed Moncler in its no-fur decision. While I am not a fan of Dolce & Gabbana at all — who are known for their anti-Black and anti-Asian remarks — I’m happy they are at least going fur-free. 
And, while imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, it becomes an issue when the line of separation blurs too much. Watchful eyes, such as Highsnobiety and Diet Prada are usually on top of these yellow flags, but in case you didn’t want to leave this column, let me break down why Hermès has been in everyone’s mouth this year.
The most obvious brand that has started to try and be more like Hermès is, surprisingly, Chanel. I’ve always felt that Chanel had a very particular feel and aura to the brand — the tweed, quilts and flashes of gold unique to them. But last year, Chanel started to raise its bag prices.
It could be because of economical reasons — as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, tourism numbers decreased, companies closed in-person boutiques and attempted to save some cash. However, prices raised again in January — the fourth time in 12 months — and prices of its Coco Handle bags increased between 8.7% and 11.6%, depending on the size of the bag, and the flap bag from between 4% to 7%.
The reason? Most likely to stay competitive with Hermès and attempt to reach Birkin and Kelly status. For those who don’t know, an Hermès customer cannot go in and buy a Birkin or Kelly bag. Instead, these bags, ranging from $12,000 to $18,000 for a Birkin or $7,500 to $50,000 for a Kelly, which depend on size, color, material and hardware, are purchased by invite only. 
Yes, you have to be invited to purchase a Birkin or Kelly. 
And, yet, people go wild over these bags. The exclusivity makes people want them more, as if to subtly say, “Look! Look at me! I’m amazing and rich!” So, now, Chanel is trying to emulate this insane brand loyalty with these increased prices.
However, Chanel’s attempts to compete with Hermès seem to falter as the new Chanel Spring- Summer 2022 collection is not trying to compete with Hermès but, instead, took the shape of Hermès and its history.
Hermès got huge for its involvement with equestrian and horse riding — hence the reason its stores have saddles, horsehouse accessories and a horse carriage logo. Chanel even opened its SS22 show with a horse. 
Chanel additionally, had Charlotte Casiraghi, model, writer, daughter of Caroline (Princess of Hanover) and 11th in line to the throne of Monaco, trot down the runway on her horse KusKus. I mean, the dots are pretty connected. Need I say more?
But Hermès’ significant influence doesn’t only apply to Chanel. Another major brand that followed suit is, equally surprisingly, Dior. 
Last January, Hermès announced Hermès Fit, a gym to get your (chic and sleek) sweat on, that was Hermès themed and decorated with its signature burnt orange. While these were pop-up gyms set up internationally, it was still a great PR move to promote post quarantine health and fitness and its brand. 
Two months later, Dior announced a partnership with Technogym. It also released fitness equipment and set up pop-up gyms, where it invited people to come in and train in the Dior gym space. 
I’m not sure what Dior will do next or if its next move will also mimic Hermès. But seeing its latest collection, adorned with its classic, light florals and new collaboration with Birkenstock — which will be the only pair I will actively try to buy — it seems this might be a one-time coincidence.
Am I reading into this too much? You tell me.
But one thing is pretty clear: In the world of high fashion, Hermès is an it girl. 
Hadyn Phillips is a freshman writing about fashion in the 21st century, specifically spotlighting students and popular controversy. Her column, “That’s Fashion, Sweetie,” runs every other Monday.

After defeating Claremont-Mudd-Scripps and Occidental, women’s water polo remained undefeated this weekend. USC staved off a late comeback against No. 8 Fresno State, winning 15-11, before stomping No. 11 San José State 20-3 at the UCLA Mini Invite.
The Trojans began the game in strong fashion. Senior utility Bayley Weber and redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns each scored 2 goals in the first half. Whenever Fresno State scored, USC would retake full control of the game. 
USC emphasized full control at the end of the third quarter when Weber wrestled the ball away from a Bulldog, sprinted down the right side of the pool and muscled through another defender before flipping the ball past the goalie. The Trojans entered the final six minutes with a 13-5 advantage.
But a quick Fresno State barrage cut the lead down to 5 goals and sucked all the life out of the USC team. 
“Especially in the last quarter, we gave up way too many exclusions,” Head Coach Marko Pintaric said. “I’m really not happy with the way the defense looked, and hopefully, they will improve throughout the week and the season.”
At one point, the Bulldogs pulled within four, but senior 2-meter Mireia Guiral put away the game with over a minute left. The Trojans walked away with a 15-11 victory but left some points on the board — 11 of their 35 shots hit the framework. 
Some may say it was an off day, but Pintaric doesn’t want anything to do with excuses.
“Offensively, we had a lot of missed shots, high-percentage shots, and we created really good opportunities overall,” Pintaric said. “[But] there’s no luck in sports. I don’t believe in that. I think you

No. 8 USC faced No. 2 UC Berkeley and No. 11 Stanford this weekend in a tough two-meet stretch. The Trojans dropped both meets, losing 198.5-94.5 against the Golden Bears and 182-118 against the Cardinal. 
USC is now 4-2 overall,  2-2 in Pac-12 play. 
The Trojans suffered a definite loss against Berkeley Friday. Freshman Daniel Matheson scored a personal record in the 1000-yard freestyle and placed third (9:11.90). Junior Ivan Puskovitch followed close behind in fourth (9:27.50). 
Freshman Artem Selin placed second in the 50-yard freestyle with a 19.76. The freestyle swimmer holds the German national age record in the men’s 50 short course meter, 21:25.
While the Trojans did not produce any individual wins against Berkeley, USC lessened the gap against Stanford on Saturday despite the loss. Senior Victor Johansson hit a season record in the 1000-yard freestyle and placed second (9:08.18), followed by Matheson in third (9:11.65). 
The 50-yard freestyle start was challenging for Nikola Miljenic after his diving block’s failure; however, the senior still managed to take third place in the event. Miljenic later placed first in the 100-yard freestyle (43.94), followed by junior Max Saunders in second place (44.31). 
Senior distance freestyler Owen Kao said he felt confident about the team’s long-term goals, including the Pac-12 championship. 
“As we’re coming down to the end of the season, it’s a lot about putting everything together and getting ready for the championship swims,” Kao said. “So just kind of honing in on the very small details is really big, and I think we were doing that today.”
Johansson, a distance freestyler from Sweden, said he felt confident about his swims despite great fatigue from intense post season training. 
“We’re training pretty hard,” Johansson said. “[Head Coach Hongping Li] has been very thorough with [emphasizing], ‘This is not the end goal, we’re training for Pac-12s and then ultimately NCAAs.’” 
Kao and Johansson emphasized the importance of maintaining high energy for the duration of the meet, whether on the deck or while swimming in the events. “I think the energy is really big, as Stanford is probably our biggest rival in the Pac-12, so bringing the energy and really not backing down from each individual race is gonna be huge,” Kao said. 
Johansson specified his goals for this meet and the rest of the season, specifically regarding his long course races like the 500-yard freestyle and the 1000-yard freestyle. 
“I definitely want to be on the podium for NCAAs. That’s been the goal basically since I got here my freshman year,” said Johansson regarding his personal goals for the season. 
After some health struggles over the past two years, Johansson came back strong by making the Olympic team and is now focusing on his mental as well as his physical health. 
“This year it’s only been, like, happiness and, you know, enjoying what I’m doing here, but definitely I’m working toward the podium for the 500 free, and it feels like I’m on track for that,” Johansson said. 
There are some improvements Johansson can take from the meet against Stanford. 
 “I think just getting after it more, being more aggressive in the second half, especially in the 500 [yard freestyle],” Johansson said. “I need to work on my turns. I’m a long course meter kind of guy.” 
The Trojans head out of state to their final dual meet of the season against Utah Feb. 12.

If you walked past the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sunday, you might have second guessed your hearing. Instead of the familiar whistles or referee announcements, a different sound echoed throughout the legendary Coliseum. 
Cars, cars, cars and more cars revved their engines across the sidelines where Head Coach Lincoln Riley will call plays in the fall. Instead of quarterback Caleb Williams looking downfield for a home run play, drivers raced around the middle of the field after it was transformed into a place to pit cars after a crash. 
Home of events such as the Olympics, Super Bowl, World Series and, of course, USC Football, the historic Coliseum hosted NASCAR’s 43rd annual Busch Light Clash.  
Previously held at Daytona International Speedway since 1979, the Clash’s move to the Coliseum was the first time it has been held at a collegiate stadium. 
NASCAR held an event at Chicago’s Soldier Field in 1956, but nothing came close to this. Unlike previous races, the track was already built inside the location. This time, NASCAR built it from scratch. 
More than two months ago, the Trojans played their final game of the season against BYU on turf. The field was then taken apart, with NASCAR converting the inside of the stadium into an asphalt track in December. 
The quarter-mile track in the Coliseum was the shortest track ever recorded in the Cup Series’ modern history. Drivers qualified Saturday night for the four heat races that took place the next day. Kyle Busch, who finished the race 2nd, was the fastest qualifier. 
Fans flocked from around Southern California to attend the race, one of them being Nick Muller — a USC alumnus — from Orange County. Muller came with a group of around 20 USC alumni to revisit the stadium where they watched the Trojans play. 
Muller said he attended a NASCAR event a long time ago but considered the Busch Clash to be his first time. 
“Honestly, I don’t know much about NASCAR,” he said. “I’m sure it’ll just be some loud engines flying around, and it’ll be fun.”
Even with loud cars revving around the track, the unique atmosphere of the event served as NASCAR’s best marketing strategy. The track’s construction at the Coliseum, a place where he attended football games as a Trojan, enticed Muller the most.
“How the hell they put a track in here, I don’t know,” said Muller with a chuckle. “It’s just so cool… I’ve probably been going to SC games since I was four years old … Just to go to a stadium for different events is just something that was interesting.”
For new NASCAR fan and Panorama City-native Andrew Garcia, the stature of the event taking place at the Coliseum sparked his interest to see what it was about.
“I figured it was the first time, might as well go out and see it,” Garcia said. “I, myself, don’t consider myself to be a NASCAR fan, but anytime it’s the first time happening in this city, it’s bound to draw a lot of curious folks.” 
And curious folks filled the stadium to watch Ice Cube perform and Joey Logano become victorious on the same stage where Reggie Bush finished his most famous highlights.

Paper lanterns, lion dances and festive music and cultural dances rang in the Lunar New Year — the Year of the Tiger — at the USC Pacific Asia Museum’s Lunar New Year Festival. The museum hosted the virtual festival Saturday, showcasing various performances of music, dance, martial arts demonstrations and storytelling. 
“This is the Year of the Tiger, where there’s ferocity, bravery, strength and courage associated with this year … Let’s go strong into the year without being paralyzed by anything negative to keep you down,” said Bobo Chang, an actor, fitness content creator and host of the festival, in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
The Korean Classical Music and Dance Company kicked the event off with the hwa kwan moo, or flower crown dance. Led by company director Don Kim, the dance is usually performed for the royal family. The dancers also performed the chang-go chum, or hourglass drum dance, an acrobatic folk dance, as well as the gayageum, a 12-stringed instrument and the buchae-chum — fan dance — a dance meant to value the joy of life and happiness. 
Kim also gave a short Korean lesson on how to say the greeting, annyeonghaseyo, which could mean good morning, good evening, good afternoon or hello. Attendees also learned to say gamsahamnida, which means thank you, and saehae bok mani badeusipsio to wish others a happy new year. 
Following the dance and language lesson, the USC Kazan Taiko, a Japanese drumming ensemble performed. The ensemble derives its name from the Japanese word for volcano, which Chang said is an “explosive force that inspires them and characterizes their playing style.”
“Kazan’s goal is to provide a place for their members to express themselves through rhythm and movement, while learning and participating in the tradition of Japanese taiko drumming,” Chang said. 
Kazan Taiko played two songs: “Matsuri,” which means festival in Japanese, and “Rising Dragon Fist,” which was written by former members of the ensemble. Artistic director Zoe Beyler, a junior majoring in percussion performance, said the group has a “strong culture of writing [their] own pieces.”
“I was really excited and happy with how the performance went,” Beyler said. “I was really excited for all the new members to get to perform for the first time, and I really liked getting to perform [at the museum] because it was really pretty and it is an interesting place.”
After their performance, Chang shared anecdotes of his personal favorite Lunar New Year traditions, such as eating tteokguk, a rice cake soup. In Korea, eating the soup signifies adding a year to your age and, as a child, Chang said he enjoyed eating several bowls and declaring himself to be “50 at eight years old.” 
The next performance was by the Northern Shaolin Kung Fu Association, whose mission is to promote and preserve Chinese culture and heritage. The group specializes in Chinese lion and dragon dancing, and also showcases dynamic martial arts demonstrations. 
Barbara Wong, who served as resident storyteller for the Honolulu Zoo and developed culinary and walking tours of Honolulu’s Chinatown, shared legends from various Asian cultures. She started off with the story of Songtsan Gambo and Princess Wenchang, told the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl and concluded with the Vietnamese legend of how the moon became ivory. 
To close off the festival, Clazzical Notes artists Yihan Chen on the pipa — the Chinese lute — and Haowei Cheng on the gu zheng — the Chinese harp — gave a musical performance. 
“Overall, it was beautiful and [there were] a lot of very talented performers,” Chang said. “You could really feel the art and the emotion and the celebration of the New Year … Being able to be up close like that is more intimate, and you’re able to get even a deeper connection with the art.”

Content warning: This article contains references to gun violence and mass shootings.
Besides sharing a healthy football rivalry, having vigorous school spirit and residing in the city of Los Angeles, USC and UCLA have another thing in common: the active and continued threat of gun violence on both campuses. 
According to Newsweek, former UCLA philosophy lecturer Matthew Harris sent a threatening video to members of the UCLA community that referenced a mass shooting Jan. 31. The message disrupted campus at UCLA and left students and faculty unsettled and vulnerable. Though Harris is currently detained in Colorado, that doesn’t stop the imminent threat of mass shootings lingering in the minds of those living in L.A. 
Harris’ threats of gun violence is only one of many disturbing cases and reveals an alarming pattern of gun violence in L.A. Last semester, USC also received anonymous phone calls threatening campus with gun violence and bomb threats back in November. Though local officials deemed the threat not credible, such incidents have become too normalized in large cities such as L.A. and pose a great threat to the livelihoods of the city’s residents and college students.
Though daily Department of Public Safety logs chronicle criminal activities surrounding campus, extreme issues such as gun violence should not be normalized at USC. The commonality of crimes should not justify its presence in the city. 
Many incoming students often also consider the safety of a school’s location when deciding which college to attend. Having to factor gun violence in their college decisions already indicates the severity of the continued battle against gun violence in the United States.
According to a Pew Research Center 2021 survey, nearly 50% of Americans view gun violence as a severe problem in the country. However, there remains a disturbing precedent regarding gun violence in large cities that has manifested in anxiety and fear among the student body. 
In recent years, L.A. experienced a spike in gun violence. Gun violence in the city hit a 15-year high in 2021, culminating to 400 deaths in 2021 alone. Such increases in crime signal a demand for greater restrictions on gun usage and firearm possessions as well as greater regulation reflected in policy and legislation. 
Helen Ubinas, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, took only seven minutes to buy an AR-15 — the same semiautomatic rifle Stephen Paddock used to kill 59 people in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. When purchasing something as destructive and deadly as an AR-15, it should take longer than seven minutes. Lengthy and thorough background checks ensure violent weapons end up in responsible hands, and thus should be prioritized over efficiency in delivering weapons to consumers. 
The culture of American gun ownership can also be partly to blame for the raging epidemic of gun violence in cities such as L.A. The continual defense and support for greater expansion of gun access continues to polarize a country in the midst of this issue. 
The same survey from the Pew Research Center showed that Americans are split on whether restricting access to guns will alleviate mass shootings. It demonstrates the dichotomized approaches to implementing remedies that will protect citizens while keeping political peace. 
Our structural and systemic methods of distribution contain deadly flaws in need of remedy. Without any action, we will only continue to face unnecessary losses that continue to affect the USC community even when we don’t realize it. Such threats signal a glaring issue, and the continual ignorance of these problems will result in more traumatic events. 
While no physical harm took place on UCLA’s campus, the egregious nature of the threat takes an extreme toll on the emotional and mental health of those involved. According to the American Psychology Association and a 2019 survey conducted by the Harris Poll, “more than three-quarters of adults (79%) in the U.S. say they experience stress as a result of the possibility of a mass shooting.”
While students and faculty can remain vigilant of their surroundings, not much else can be accomplished to ensure safety at the individual level. However, at federal and state levels, legal restrictions on firearms can effectively reduce the prevalence of such harms. Nonetheless, implementation of gun control passages is not enough. Even with California Proposition 63 and “the majority of California voters [who] say that they believe gun control laws are effective in reducing violent crime,” studies done by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times, show that confidence in such laws “has slipped.”
The conversation surrounding gun control is sticky — the fine line between freedom and safety and its ties to America’s core values makes finding solutions to mass shootings difficult and arduous to implement. Unfortunately, for both USC and UCLA, the nature of school shooting threats will most likely repeat itself in the future unless drastic action is implemented and enforced by higher municipalities.
If the history of America’s gun violence has taught us anything, proper solutions must be enacted to disrupt the deadly cycle of mass shootings. As we keep this in mind, let us not approach our current situation with fear, but rather, with hope and aspirations for a safer future.

After “unjust” treatment at the hands of New Jersey law enforcement, Erroll Southers looked to take part in a “solution” for bettering public safety. Now, after holding an extensive career in uniform and working in transport security and counterterrorism, Southers serves as USC’s first associate senior vice president of safety and risk assurance.
Appointed in early January, Southers is responsible for all University safety divisions, including the Department of Public Safety, the Environmental Health and Safety Department and fire safety emergency planning. 
“I’m responsible for … everything from Trojan Check to crime, all of those elements that go into keeping our faculty, staff, students, visitors on campus and our neighbors safe,” said Southers in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
The University posted the position last June. The position was something the University “felt it needed for quite some time,” Southers said.
Before beginning the application process for the job, Southers served as the co-chair of the DPS Community Advisory Board. While holding the role, he helped create 45 recommendations for improving public safety, published July 28, included a proposal of an independent DPS oversight body. 
“A large part of the responsibilities for [vice president of safety and risk assurance] is seeing through the implementation of those recommendations that we proposed last year,” Southers said. 
Southers is a 1998 USC graduate, and a longtime veteran of law enforcement. He started at the Santa Monica Police Department and ended his uniform career at the Los Angeles World Airports police department as assistant chief of police at the Office of Homeland Security and Intelligence. He also spent time with the FBI, working on foreign counterintelligence, SWAT, counterterrorism and in the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security as the deputy director for critical infrastructure. 
Despite spending several years in uniform, teaching has always been central to Southers’ life. He taught at the Rio Hondo Police Academy, and during his time as a police officer, he earned his teaching credential for the state of California, followed by his masters and doctoral degrees. He would then work at the Sol Price School of Public Policy as a professor of practice and as part of the Safe Communities Institute, which works on public safety strategy, policy and communications. 
“I love campuses. I love learning. I love teaching,” Southers said. “I bring a lot of things to the classroom that are not so much theory, but real world in terms of the things that I share with them, and [students] seem to benefit from it.” 
Sol Price School of Public Policy Dean Dana Goldman worked closely with Southers over the last two years while Southers worked as a professor at the school and director of the Safe Communities Institute. Goldman said he not only admires Southers’ character and compassion but also the wealth of expertise he brings to his new role.
“Dr. Southers successfully built the Safe Communities Institute into one of the nation’s premier university centers to engage communities and improve public safety. His methods and training not only keep us safer, but do so in a way that improves the relationship between law enforcement and the constituencies they serve,” said Goldman in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Jessie Redd, associate director and current interim director of the Safe Communities Institute — a division of the Price School of Public Policy engaged in public safety research and interdisciplinary education — spent the last four years working with Southers. 
“He’s just taught me so much, so many skills. I would say the most important thing he taught me is the importance of relationship building and maintaining healthy relationships because you never know when you’re going to run into someone again or lean on them,” Redd said. “His lived experiences are going to help him be the best associate senior vice president.”
Southers said he acknowledges the importance of law enforcement, policing, public safety and community engagement, which he said is a high priority in his new role.
“We have a lot of partners through the Safe Communities Institute where I was a director for three years, and I’m going to leverage those relationships with those partners so we can build a stronger and much more resilient bridge between us and the community as we go forward,” Southers said. 
Southers’ main project currently is recruiting DPS’ next chief. Holding six public input sessions for the University community, Southers will then push applicants through several committees and further input sessions to identify the best possible candidate. 
“The benefit, then, is the students get to really understand what DPS does, understand how they can enhance their life on campus and, more importantly, hold them to this issue of accountability and transparency that we are talking about,” Southers said. “I would like to see less of an emphasis on enforcement and more of an emphasis on community care.”
Southers also looks to push enhanced communication between USC and its neighbors as part of his new role. There are members of the surrounding community on the Community Advisory Board, Southers said, and on the search committee for the new DPS chief. 
“The conversations have to increase, the opportunities have to increase,” Southers said. “We’ve had a history of bridging with the community, and I’m hoping to enhance that history,” Southers said. 
Looking ahead, Southers said his main priority is realizing the ONE USC Safety Vision and accomplishing campus safety even with the threat of crime that comes with being in an urban environment. Southers said he hopes to better educate students on safety and work with the student community on promoting these lessons and safety values.
“I want us to be known as the safest campus in the United States, and I want that to happen because I want people to say that everybody here is treated fairly, respected and kept safe like everyone else,” Southers said. “You can’t learn if you’re not safe.”

It’s a bright, sunny morning in Southern California. You wake up ready to conquer another day — wind in your hair, a new pair of footwear. 
Let’s be real: You wake up and drag your perpetually tired, sleep deprived self as your alarm rings for … Oh, who can keep track anymore? The weight of your everlasting responsibility and continuous existence falling on you. 
But you pair that cute top you got on sale with your favorite high waist flare jeans and, suddenly, the world feels like a better place. The eye bags and raccoon-like dark circles are no match for the floating feeling of a flawless fit. Maybe this day won’t be bad after all, you tell yourself. 
Sashaying into USC Village ready to earn your due and, perhaps, get a blueberry matcha latte too — you stop in your tracks. A weighted blanket (not the good kind) of self-doubt creeps into your mind. The feeling of being perceived.
You feel like you’re drowning. Your head keeps coming up to the surface only to be pushed down again. What could be worse than feeling like a plethora of strangers are simultaneously, telepathically communicating about you? 
Your best impression of a mysterious persona — cool clothes and an oversized pair of sunglasses — are no match for the X-ray vision these strangers seem to possess. One glance and they instantly know about that one time in third grade when you ate a piece of chalk to prove how much of a badass you are. 
The best course of action would be to leave of course: immediately and inconspicuously. But could that lead to further questions? Most likely an admission of defeat. Definitely more perceiving.
You stand your ground — not because you want to, but because you have to. Drawing the least amount of attention to yourself and blending into the background is the best bet. Now would be the best time for the ground to swallow you whole. 
Head held high and matcha safely secured, you are ready to face your demons. Popeye and spinach are nothing compared to you and matcha. Slamming the door with a bang, you stomp outside, only to slip in your own self-doubt and spill your matcha all over yourself. 
Bated breath. Not a single glance or blink of an eye. No one has been looking in your direction at any point. They couldn’t care less. As you stare hopelessly, you see the same madness you felt within reflected in their eyes. 
But if everyone is feeling perceived, who is doing the perceiving? 
Everyone is so self-absorbed with how they’re being seen by others that they have no time to see anyone else. Between classes, jobs, social life, sleep deprivation, hydration and feeling self-conscious — there is simply no room to add perceiving to the list. And, let’s face it, the act of walking across USC Village and buying yourself a matcha latte is not even worth talking about unless it’s your bank account doing the talking.       
So the next time you walk around USC Village or campus feeling perceived, think instead of how we’re all slowly marching toward our deaths — one step closer with each step we take. The thought will give you such a ridiculous expression, you might actually give someone something worth perceiving.
