Two USC parents in the college admissions case who requested that their prison sentences be converted to home confinement due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus were denied in court Thursday after the court found they did not meet requirements for the modification.
Douglas Hodge and Michelle Janavs submitted motions last week alleging that their sentences for their roles in the Operation Varsity Blues scandal would pose a threat to their health in light of the increased contagion reported in federal prisons during the coronavirus pandemic. Janavs cited preexisting health conditions that would further increase the severity of her symptoms should she contract the virus. She quoted figures from the Bureau of Prisons showing increasing numbers of coronavirus cases in federal prisons, while Hodge stated that his age, 62 years, elevated his vulnerability to the virus.
In the order filed Thursday, the court acknowledged the defendants’ concerns of endangerment but stated that they had not yet exhausted all other means of modifying their sentences. Hodge and Janavs would not meet conditions for consideration of a sentence reduction regardless, the government argued in an opposition entered Tuesday, citing Janavs’ presentence physicals indicating good physical health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines about at-risk populations.
“Their motions should be denied for the separate reason that they cannot establish ‘extraordinary and compelling circumstances’ that would justify reduced sentences,” the opposition read. “BOP has instituted substantial policies and procedures to manage the pandemic and prevent the spread of infection.”
The opposition also noted that no staff or prisoners at either of the facilities to which Hodge and Janavs were assigned have tested positive for the coronavirus. 
The judge declined the parents’ requests for home confinement on grounds of failure to meet administrative requirements, ruling instead to postpone their self-surrender dates to June 30 from their previous reporting deadlines of May 4 and 7, respectively. 
According to the government’s opposition, only individuals already in federal custody may appeal to commute a prison sentence to home confinement, a condition that would preclude both Hodge and Janavs from submitting their requests. 
“Janavs’s contention that she has satisfied the exhaustion requirements ignores the plain language of the statute, which does not contemplate a motion by an individual who is not yet in BOP custody,” the document read. “While Janavs may have sent a letter to a warden at a BOP facility, until she actually reports to that facility and is taken into custody, that warden is not ‘the warden of the defendant’s facility.’”
Hodge was sentenced to nine months in prison and fined $750,000 in February for paying for four of his children’s college admissions — including two to USC — as false athletic recruits and for attempting to fraudulently secure his fifth child’s acceptance to Loyola Marymount University in the same manner. His sentence is the heaviest to date in the college admissions scandal.
Janavs was sentenced in February to five months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $250,000 after pleading guilty in October to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering for arranging for her daughter’s false recruitment to USC’s beach volleyball team and rigging her two daughters’ SAT scores. 
Hodge and Janavs are among 19 parents in the admissions case with ties to USC, six of whom pleaded guilty and proceeded with sentencing. The remaining 11 parents connected to the University have opted to contest charges and will be tried in Boston federal court beginning in October.

Like many other international students, I chose to remain in the United States before travel restrictions were in place. Returning to my home country of Holland would have made it difficult to handle classes with a nine-hour time difference. It also would have deprived me of a critical summer internship, which would hopefully pave the way for employment after graduation next year. 
The personal sacrifice — being separated from my home and locked in isolation — is difficult to endure. My parents fear for my safety; I fear for my financial security. The pressure to micromanage expenses is greater than ever. International students all over the United States are facing similar circumstances: They are locked down, separated from home and financially insecure.
This is where our American classmates enter the picture. We need your support now more than ever before. We don’t have families here to advocate on our behalf. We don’t have the same rights as Americans. We don’t have stable sources of personal income. 
You can help by begging University officials to stop seizing the earnings of international students with part-time jobs or internships. This kind of leverage over any student must not be tolerated.  And yet, it’s happening across the country before our very eyes. 
International students need to be enrolled in an internship course to receive work authorization under the Curricular Practical Training program. If a summer internship in Los Angeles pays me a total of $3,000, I will have to pay USC with more than 50% of my earnings to cover the cost of a one-unit internship course. Employers cannot hire international students unless they are enrolled in an internship course under CPT. Universities exploit this condition by charging tuition for that internship course, even if it does not add to their own costs.  
For colleges to force international students, in a time of global hardship, to pay the administration tuition fees for work authorization is a gross injustice. International students deserve a fair and steady path to earn wealth and advance their careers. These hardworking students seek to contribute to the American economy, and they pose tremendous value. Studies have shown that a one percentage point increase in the college-educated immigrant shares of the U.S. population produces a 12-27% increase in patenting per capita. 
Standardizing financial assistance for both international and American students ensures smart and compassionate policymaking. It will build a stronger workforce, increase economic growth and propel innovation. Twenty-three percent of billion-dollar startup companies — employing millions of Americans — were founded or co-founded by international students. Imposing financial penalties will only dissuade talented international students from entering the United States workforce. Aren’t we looking for more contributors to help build GDP?
In a time of global crisis, those with power must experiment with solutions to novel problems that emerge. Instead of requiring students to pay for a one-unit internship course, students should be able to get CPT without paying the university tuition through a zero-unit internship course. This option would not be unprecedented for USC. ENGR-598 is a zero-unit internship class on offer at Viterbi and enrolled students remain eligible for CPT. 
College administrators across the United States must provide all international students the option of enrolling in a zero-unit internship course for Summer 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. We simply cannot afford to pay our colleges for our hard work any longer. 
This global pandemic has brought all of us together to face a dangerous invisible enemy. We must do everything we can to win this fight, to keep the economy and the individuals which are fed by it healthy. Allowing colleges to impose an undue cost on the hard work of international students during this crisis is not only hurting those students but hurting the country as well. 
At USC, Undergraduate Student Government Sens. Dario Argenese, Julian Lin and Ruben Romeo have been drafting a policy change proposal to add a zero-unit internship course option for this summer. Similar advocacy must be initiated at colleges across the United States. The urgency of this situation cannot be overstated. The international student community is in desperate need of your support.

USC will not require prospective first-year students to submit ACT or SAT test scores during the upcoming application cycle, USC Admission announced Thursday. The decision follows that of other universities that have altered admissions requirements for the Class of 2025 due to disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic.
Applicants to the freshman class will be required to submit transcripts, essays and letters of recommendation as usual with their application and will be able to submit standardized test scores if they choose. School and major applications that include special materials, such as auditions or portfolios, will maintain those requirements.
“Applicants will not be penalized or put at a disadvantage if they choose not to submit SAT or ACT scores,” the Test Option FAQ page read. “USC’s student selection process has always been holistic, and we are confident in our ability to identify student potential using the totality of what’s presented to us.”
SAT and ACT testing has been suspended for the remainder of Spring 2020 and will not resume until fall. The College Board has added an additional SAT date in September, totaling four testing options before the end of the year. It is not yet clear if testing will be held in person or online. 
The decision to make test scores optional will not affect USC’s merit scholarship process, according to the FAQ page. Students who apply before the Dec. 1 deadline will be evaluated holistically.
“Our scholarships are awarded based on all-around excellence, and we have never awarded merit aid based on formulas or test score/GPA cut-offs,” the FAQ page read.
The announcement comes after similar decisions by other colleges, including Scripps College, Harvard College and schools in the University of California system, amid disruptions to standardized testing due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most states have canceled mandatory districtwide testing, while the College Board has shortened and digitized the 2020 AP exams.
