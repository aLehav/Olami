Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution to begin renovations and update menu items at Moreton Fig.
Last semester, USG introduced some potential campus improvements, including renovating Moreton Fig and installing of water-refill stations around campus.
A meeting with Associate Director of special events, sales and marketing Erika Chesley led to the formation of a team of 40 to 50 delegates, which mainly consisted of freshmen. The team was created to specifically address campus improvement. Beginning fall 2014, the team and USG collaborated to create a proposal that outlined potential improvements.
Jordan Fowler, current USG director of university affairs and vice-president elect for the 2015-2016 school year, has been leading projects related to campus improvements.
“One of our ideas was to talk to hospitality about Moreton Fig and how we can increase its visibility,” Fowler said. “Most importantly, we want to make it as successful as we think it can be.”
Fowler said a student proposed an idea to initiate changes to the menu to guarantee faster service.
“One student proposed a happy hour menu and other students said that there needed to be a way to guarantee in and out between classes,” Fowler said.
Fowler said Chesley was very understanding and excited to pursue the proposed ideas. Moreton Fig is currently working on the renovations, which includes a more student-friendly menu in terms of affordability.
“You can have a nice sit-down lunch and you’ll be able to make it to you next class,” said Hassaan Ebrahim, USG chief of staff. “They’ll be changing and rearranging some of the furniture on the patio and releasing the new menu around spring break, which is great, because that’ll give students a new option which is more affordable than it was before.”
In the proposal to Director of hospitality Eric Johnson, USG created an ideal sample menu with finger foods that are catered toward faster dining. The changes to the patio layout and menu at Moreton Fig are scheduled for completion after spring break.
Additionally, USG is currently working on another campus renovation to install new water bottle refilling stations around campus.
Fowler explained that students are more encouraged to bring their own sustainable water bottles if they have a simpler way of filling them up.
“One of our senators came up with the idea of water bottle refilling stations,” Fowler said. “Since there are amazing refilling stations in the residential dorms on campus we thought it made sense to have more of those around campus. It works with the motto of being a more sustainable and being more eco-friendly campus.”
USC facilities are planning on installing nine automatic water-refill stations around campus in the next several weeks.
Fowler said this project also inspired potential changes with USG university affairs itself. She explained that USG university affairs specializes in the categories of hospitality, housing, and transportation.
After speaking with the director of operations within Facilities Management Services at USC, Fowler sent about 20 students to every location on campus where they would like to see a water bottle refilling station.
“I remember it was one of the hottest days of last fall and they all ran around campus, took pictures of where they would want the station and wrote a little description about why it would benefit students to place it there,” Fowler said.
Fowler said that she is still in the process of drafting new proposals for the remainder of this semester and next year.
“One of the projects that I want to do is to have a competition between all of the dorms and the different floors within residential halls,” Fowler said. “I know a dorm has already done it and they said it was super fun and successful.”

Members of the USC Games program spent the evening of Feb. 21 at the J. Paul Getty Museum designing games to enhance visitors’ experience of the museum.
From 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 21 to 5 p.m. on the following day, 30 members of USC Games worked together in a conference room at the Getty. Their challenge was to create games that encouraged visitors to carefully examine the artwork.
USC Games is a student-led organization that congregates individuals who express interest in game design. Students majoring in computer science (games) in the Viterbi School of Engineering or in the School of Cinematic Arts’s interactive entertainment major automatically become part of the organization.
The group, however, is not limited to students within these specific majors. Any student with an interest in game design can join the organization. Currently, many students in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Marshall School of Business also take part in USC Games.
Michael Francisco, a junior majoring in critical studies, is an active member of the games program. Francisco described the program as a way for students from different fields to come together and increasing viewer engagement in the arts.
“[USC Games is] a collaboration of students that wish to make entertainment interactive,” Francisco said.
Tracy Fullerton, director of USC Game Innovation Lab, described how the idea of Global Game Jam originated. Game Jam is a startup weekend in which individuals get together to brainstorm ideas and work on a project to develop video games between the span of 24 to 72 hours.
“Representatives of the Getty came to talk to the members of USC Games about civic engagement,” Fullerton said. “I followed up with them to see if our students could work with them and possibly hold a game jam at the museum. They really liked the idea.”
Susan Edwards, a senior writer and editor of the news and web department at the Getty, explained that this was the first time the museum had hosted this type of event.
“We have never hosted a Game Jam and we also have never had people spend the night here,” Edwards said.
It was also the first time members of USC Games experienced the Game Jam event in a museum setting.
“We do jams at USC every month, but this is the first time we go somewhere else,” Fullerton said.
Though Edwards expected the prototypes of the games to be more digital, the Getty did not set any limitations in regards to the platforms that the games would be on.
Colleen Dimmer, a senior majoring in interactive entertainment, described her night at the museum.
“Last night, a group of us watched the sunset and then took a dusk stroll through the park,” Dimmer said. “Those of us that spent the night enjoyed a few brief hours of sleep on the floor. However, between the goodie bags of late-night snacks and the endless coffee, I don’t think I’ll ever attend such a well-provided Game Jam again.”
On Sunday, a panel of judges reviewed the students’ projects. Among the judges were Todd Martens, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who writes about interactive entertainment; Sara Thacher, a transmedia producer and experience designer and Peter Marx, first chief innovation technology officer for the city of Los Angeles.
Fullerton stated her aspirations with this project.
“It’s amazing how deep every piece at the Getty is,” Fullerton said. “We hope that with the games that the students develop, we can help visitors engage with the pieces of art more deeply.”

Undergraduate Student Government is currently spearheading a new initiative to establish a price cap on textbooks for General Education courses.
USG Director of University Affairs and vice president-elect for the 2015-2016 school year Jordan Fowler has been a key correspondent in the proposal to create the price cap initiative.
Fowler said that the issue of overpriced general education textbooks is one of concern, since many students tend to opt out of certain classes based on the price of the textbooks.
“Essentially, I was in a GE and the textbook cost a couple of hundred dollars,” Fowler said. “I switched out of the GE, not necessarily for the cost but a multitude of reasons, and that’s when I realized that there are students who are having to pick courses based off how much the materials cost.”
Fowler and a team of USG delegates proposed the initiative in a meeting last week to a group of administrators.
“They went through and collected a syllabus of every GE course whether from their friend[s] or online, and collected data on how much those textbooks cost at the bookstore and on Amazon and put together a giant Excel document,” Fowler said.
Fowler explained that she knows the initiative will be difficult to implement in GE categories where textbook pricing tends to range higher, but USG will put its best effort into creating a reasonable price cap to monitor how much these materials will cost.
“We’re not going to go in with a specific number, we want to see if [the administration] is receptive to the idea first, and then just try to work with them for what would be reasonable and work with professors to make sure they don’t abuse the rule,” Fowler said.
The University Bookstore sells books that can cost more than $200. Since students must complete a total of six to eight GEs to graduate, Fowler said she is concerned that students might not have the freedom to explore subjects they are unfamiliar with because of cost restrictions.
“Within a given category, when the topic is supposed to be very similar, the materials need to be standardized in some way, the cost for those materials,” Fowler said.
For example, science, technology, engineering and math books generally cost more in comparison to books in categories in a different field such as Foreign Language.
Heidi Torres, a freshman majoring in human biology, said she is glad USG has begun advocating for students who cannot afford expensive textbooks.
“Being a low-income student, these are books that I can’t afford and I know plenty of other people who are complaining about these excessive prices,” Torres said.
Fowler also said there might be alternative methods of acquiring expensive textbooks in classes where it is absolutely necessary for students to pay more than the set price cap.
“If a professor feels a textbook is crucial to students’ understanding and material, perhaps it should be on the university’s responsibility to supplement that extra fee but that’s one thing we will also talk about,” Fowler said.
Despite an increase in advocacy for the creation of a price gap, some students have expressed concern that the new price cap will affect other university fees, especially if the university is expected to cover extra textbook costs.
Allison Mobley, a freshman majoring in economics, thinks USG should put more thought into the initiative if they want to explore the idea further.
“I like the idea, but I’m just concerned about how it will affect tuition and the market for books,” Mobley said.
USG is also looking into plans for the university to notify students if a textbook price is over the set price cap.
“If those textbooks do happen to go over, there should be an email or something,” Fowler said. “They can contact student government even if we are in that position and we can work to make sure that’s not happening.”

USC ended its East Coast road trip on a high note Sunday after defeating Marist College, 11-7. Their win came just a day after they fell to No. 16-ranked Stony Brook, 7-4.
The weekend’s games were the Women of Troy’s first action since dropping an overtime thriller to a perennial powerhouse program in the Northwestern Wildcats on Feb. 7 at the Coliseum.
The trip not only provided the Women of Troy with their first opportunity to play in two weeks, but also gave them quite a test in terms of the conditions they faced.
“We had a lot of time in between our game against Northwestern, so we were able to get a lot work done on things that needed it,” said head coach Lindsey Munday. “We still have things to tweak obviously but we felt pretty good coming into this weekend about the work we put in over the last two weeks.”
The long East-Coast-to-West-Coast flight, frigid weather and four-hour drive between Saturday’s game in Stony Brook and Sunday’s morning matchup in Poughkeepsie gave the team its share of obstacles to face this weekend, in addition to two opponents looking to open up their seasons with wins on their home fields.
The first on-field test came Saturday in the form of the Stony Brook Seawolves, who came out firing.
The Seawolves jumped out to a 5-1 first half lead over the Women of Troy led by two goals from sophomore attacker and last year’s America East Rookie of the Year Dorrien Van Dyke.
For any number of reasons, the Women of Troy could not find their offensive stride in the first half, mustering just two shots to Stony Brook’s 13.
The lone goal for USC came off the stick of sophomore attacker Michaela Michael with 13:31 remaining in the half.
The second half painted a different picture, as USC rallied behind two early goals from sophomore attacker Cynthia Del Core and Michael — both within the first five minutes of the half. Stony Brook was able to slow USC’s momentum, however, and responded for two goals of their own.
They held a 7-3 lead until the final four minutes, when junior midfielder Amanda Johansen put home a goal for the Women of Troy, resulting in what would be the final score of 7-4.
“We weren’t as aggressive offensively as we would have liked, particularly in the first half,” Munday said. “They are a very good team but it’s tough to win a game in which you only shoot 10 times, so that was something we definitely were aware of heading into Sunday.”
Though the loss was disappointing — particularly offensively — the team was clearly more active in the second half, outshooting Stony Brook 8-6 and winning five draw controls to Stony Brook’s one.  USC hoped to carry whatever small momentum it built up in the second half of Saturday’s game with them on the bus ride to Poughkeepsie for their Sunday matchup with Marist.
They did exactly that: despite the 34-degree temperature, the Women of Troy came out of the gates hotter than a blowtorch, outshooting Marist 17-3 in the first half and 27-10 for the game.
Michael once again led the way offensively for USC, scoring four goals and collecting an assist for a total of five points during the game.
However, standout junior attacker Caroline de Lyra was able to match her teammate’s point total, dishing out two assists and scoring a hat trick of her own.
Michael and de Lyra were offensive catalysts for the Women of Troy, scoring or assisting on every one of the team’s first eight goals en route to a 7-2 halftime lead and an 11-7 victory, the first of the season for the team.
“We played hard and were super aggressive on all ends on the field. The girls really dug in and we were able to put the Stony Brook loss in the past behind us,”Munday said.
While it undoubtedly felt good to end the weekend with their first victory, the Women of Troy won’t have much time to rejoice.
The team faces a quick turnaround upon arrival back in Los Angeles, with their first conference game of the season on Tuesday at home against Fresno State.
“As we look down the road, whether it is conference games on Friday and Sunday or if we have to travel a fair amount, we are going to have to be tough and ready to deal with whatever is thrown at us so I think a trip like this helps prepare for that and make us tougher and stronger,” Munday said.

This past weekend, the USC football program had seven members of last year’s team participate in the NFL Combine. Overall this was an impressive number of invitations for the Trojans, who tied Oregon for the most players represented from the Pac-12.
The player whose performance will receive the most attention until draft time are is former lineman Leonard Williams, who declared early after his junior season. Williams, a consensus top-five pick in every mock draft, is vying for the No. 1 overall selection. A dominant defensive lineman while at USC, Williams played through various injuries during his time as a Trojan. This ability to play while hurt  — and play well  — was an underrated quality Williams possessed and one that will benefit him as a professional.
While many top collegiate prospects sit out with the slightest injury to not hurt their draft stock, Williams cemented his legacy as a Trojan when he played hurt during the Stanford game early in the 2014 season.
He demonstrated what it means to be a warrior on the football field, and dominated fellow top prospect Andrus Peat for periods of that game.
The main problem with the NFL Combine is that it doesn’t measure heart or intensity. While some prospects are able to run blazing fast 40-yard dashes and broad jump exceptionally far, they might not maintain great practice habits or the internal drive necessary to succeed on the professional level.
That’s why fans get fooled so often by great Combine performances that don’t always pan out over the course of a professional career. Of course there are exceptions — most notably Vernon Davis and Chris Johnson — but the body of work during a college career matters a lot more than one weekend of drills in Indianapolis. NFL scouts are aware of this and do not base their evaluations on just the combine; however, the average fan might.
That’s why JaDeveon Clowney was hyped as the next Lawrence Taylor before he stepped onto the field for the Texans. He certainly had an impressive college career, which included a sophomore season that involved a bone- crushing hit against Michigan in the bowl game. When he dealt with injuries and double and triple teams as a junior, however, he didn’t fare as well both on and off the field.
The entire season of red flags was overshadowed by the combination of his almost superhuman 4.53 40 yard dash and incredible highlight reel. When his rookie season rolled around, however, Clowney was beset by a bevy of injuries, with microfracture knee surgery ultimately ending his year early. One year is a small sample of an entire career, but it certainly doesn’t bode well for Clowney’s future, regardless of his workout-warrior status at the Combine.
Of course, Clowney could come back with a vengeance this season, buoyed by the fact that he lines up next to J.J. Watt, possibly one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the 21st century. The jury is still out on Clowney, and hopefully, he makes a full recovery and realizes his immense potential. He should just serve as an example to fans that tempering expectations after the Combine is extremely important.
In contrast to Clowney, Williams played through everything, from a busted shoulder to an injured ankle, and he didn’t once complain or sit out to protect his future.
He may not be in the same athletic class as Clowney, but Williams is also a physically dominating presence on the football field. Combine his raw tools with great instincts and a never-ending motor, and I am confident that Williams will be a better professional than Clowney or any other defensive line prospect in this draft.
Across the league, former USC defensive tackles have demonstrated their considerable skills and carved out successful careers in the league. With the exception of the most coveted collegiate prospect, Sedrick Ellis, the fraternity of USC interior lineman is pretty impressive. Mike Patterson, a member of the Wild Bunch II line with Shaun Cody, Kenechi Udeze and Omar Nazel has outlasted his fellow college teammates and is currently playing in his 10th season, his second with the New York Giants after eight with the Philadelphia Eagles.
Jurrell Casey, who followed in the footsteps of Patterson and Ellis, is one of the most underrated players in the league as a tackle for the Tennessee Titans.
Casey dominates opposing linemen with the same regularity that he had when he was disrupting Pac-12 offenses.
Fili Moala might never live up to the hype he had when he entered his final season as a Trojan, when Todd Mcshay surprisingly pegged Moala as the first pick in his initial mock draft, but is still in the league with the Colts with a longer-than-average NFL career.
Leonard Williams will be better than all of his predecessors at USC and a dynamic defender for years to come. He doesn’t have the same body type as Patterson or Casey but is just as powerful with even more versatility.
Williams’s Combine performance was solid, but it was his play on the field that foreshadows a great future as a professional.

The Trojans came roaring back on Saturday after a tough win Friday night to topple the Oakland Golden Grizzlies 11-1 in game two of the weekend series, propelling them to first place — the last undefeated team in the Pac-12.
Led at the plate by junior AJ Ramirez and on the mound by junior Kyle Twomey, USC completely dominated Oakland, scoring 11 runs on 16 hits. Twomey earned his second win of the season, throwing seven complete innings while only giving up four hits and allowing one run, one walk and six strikeouts.
USC started with offensive success, with junior Timmy Robinson delivering a sacrifice fly out to score a run in the bottom of the first. The Golden Grizzlies got on board in the top of the third after a leadoff double by sophomore Tyler Pagano and a one-out single by freshman Matt DiLeo.
The Trojans then ran away with the game, putting up nine unanswered runs to confirm the win, tallying two in the fourth, two in the fifth, one in the sixth and four in the seventh. Five Trojans had multi hit games, junior Blake Lacey, junior AJ Ramirez, sophomore Jeremy Martinez,  Robinson and redshirt sophomore Reggie Southall.
Head coach Dan Hubbs is particularly complimentary of Twomey, who has gracefully stepped up as a key starter among the Trojans’ staff.
“Kyle threw pretty well his first performance, but I thought he had better command at his fast ball today against an aggressive team and was able to get some quick outs with his fast ball and able to move the ball in and out,” Hubbs said. “Because of that, I think he was able to utilize the challenge and cause some ground balls.  You could tell by the swings [Oakland] was taking, the fowl balls going to the right side and the fact that they were frozen inside a lot on two strikes, [Kyle] can really be a force.”
Twomey attributes his success on Saturday night to settling into the season and solid mental preparation before the game.
“I think in the bullpen this week I made sure I was spotting up because I was really excited this week,” Twomey said. “I was probably a little over-amped up last week, which is why I had a little more trouble with command, but I was much more comfortable going into Friday’s game so I was able to hit my spots more and throw the ball in.”
The Trojans’ defensive showing on Saturday represented an immense improvement compared to Friday night’s game. Though USC still managed to secure the win after coming back from a four-run deficit, the Trojans struggled defensively, committing five errors in a five-run fourth inning lead by junior starter Brent Wheatley, who wasn’t on his A-game that night. Sophomore Bernardo Flores managed to do damage control, entering in the fifth inning and throwing 3.2 innings of one-hit baseball; he came up with a career-high seven strikeouts and zero walks.
USC gradually snuck up on Oakland after being down 6-2, tacking on two runs in the bottom of the fourth inning, one in the fifth and three in the sixth, putting the Trojans in the lead to win the game 8-6.
To bounce back from Friday’s rocky start, Hubbs conferenced with the team about staying focused and always coming out ready to play.
“We talked a lot about needing to be more focused and more prepared,” Hubbs said. “You can’t come in and win the game just because you’re you; you have to play well. We talked about getting our rest Friday night and coming back intense and focused and being prepared to make the plays and get the big hits, so I think the kids came more prepared Saturday than Friday. I think the kids really answered the bell well and played a really good game.”
Twomey also felt the Trojans had a fierce return on Saturday.
“You’re not going to play well all the time, but we did eventually manage to find a way to compete all nine innings [on Friday] so that’s huge,” Twomey said. “Tonight, I knew I needed to pitch efficiently and keep the tempo up and I knew these guys would play well behind me, and they did on defense and with the outs. I think that was a great response from the way we played [Friday] and going into Sunday’s game.”
Looking ahead, the Trojans will travel to Fresno State to challenge the Bulldogs this Tuesday. The Bulldogs are currently .500 for the season, with a 3-1 record at home.
To keep up the Trojans’ hot streak, Twomey feels the team must concentrate on executing and playing smart.
“I really hope we can keep this good thing we have here going and to do that we need to play fundamental baseball,” Twomey said. “If the defense continues to play good defense and the offense continues to move guys over and get them in, then I think we will be just fine. We have good starting pitching, and we have good guys in the bullpen and guys who can close the game. We’re going to try and continue this momentum into Tuesday and the rest of the week.”

The NFL Scouting Combine is in the books and the seven USC participants left a lasting impression in Indianapolis.
Standout defensive end Leonard Williams projects as a top-five pick in the NFL Draft on April 30 and appears to be one of the most NFL-ready players in this year’s class. Williams clocked a 4.97 40-yard dash time, while also finishing the three-cone drill in 7.59 seconds and the 20-yard shuttle in 4.53 seconds. He also added a 29.5-inch vertical jump as well as a 106.0-inch broad jump to his Combine performance.
Williams’ performance at the Combine might not have been off the charts, but he is a playmaker who lives in opponents’ backfields. He should be an impact player right off the bat in the NFL, and his game tape alone should be enough for scouts and general managers to consider him a top-five talent in the upcoming draft.
On Saturday, wide receiver Nelson Agholor dislocated the middle finger on his left hand, which cut off his day short. He injured his finger while running a slant during receiving drills. Prior to his injury, however, Agholor recorded an impressive 4.42 40-yard dash time in addition to cranking out 12 reps on the bench press.
That 40 time was equaled by the likes of Alabama’s Amari Cooper and Ohio State’s Devin Smith, two prolific receivers who figure to be taken early on in the draft. Like Williams, Agholor is another guy whose game film speaks for itself.
Agholor hauled in 104 balls for 1,313 yards and 12 touchdowns for the Trojans in 2014, and he showed his precise route running and strong hands in the process. Agholor has been considered a top-15 wideout in this year’s wide receiver class. That should not change come draft day.
USC redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen also turned in an impressive showing at the Combine. At 6 feet and 221 pounds, Allen is a big back, but he does not trade off any acceleration or burst just because he packs power. He finished his day with a 4.53 40 time, in addition to a 4.28 20-yard shuttle. Allen’s performance in the three-cone drill stood out, as he finished sixth among all running backs. Allen should be on the radar of any team looking to bolster its ground game. He is a physical runner who does not shy away from contact, and he can contribute in the passing game.
Hayes Pullard was productive at linebacker for the Trojans and, like Williams, proved to be a fantastic leader of the defense. Pullard ran the 40 in 4.78 seconds, the same time as Miami star linebacker Denzel Perryman. Pullard finished with 19 reps on the bench, while also logging a 31-inch vertical jump and a 110-inch broad jump. Though his Combine numbers are not record-breaking, his instincts, patience and coverage skills are all invaluable at the next level. Pullard is a tremendous leader who could be a steal for whoever drafts him.
Tight end Randall Telfer, linebacker J.R. Tavai and cornerback Josh Shaw also made the trip to Indy to show their stuff to the gurus at the NFL Combine. At 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, Telfer has the size to be an NFL tight end. Telfer’s 20 reps on the bench press undoubtedly turned some heads. Tavai also managed 20 reps on the bench. He added a 4.91 40-yard dash time, while he jumped 30.5 inches and 112.0 inches on the vertical jump and broad jump, respectively.
Meanwhile, Shaw finished with the top cornerback performance on the bench with 26 reps. While some pundits discredit the “workout warrior” crown, this good showing on the bench could do wonders for Shaw. He only played in three games this season after off-the-field issues warranted a lengthy suspension, but that whole debacle is in the rearview mirror now.
Shaw could be a solid Cover 2 corner at the next level, and at 6 feet and 201 pounds, he has the size to even play some free safety depending on where he ends up.
The weekend was a success for USC players. These players still have a ways to go before the NFL Draft, but the seven Trojans showed well in Indianapolis and managed to help their draft stock.

Since the premiere of the hit television show Scandal, lead actress Kerry Washington has broken barriers as the first African American woman to star in a primetime network television show since the 1970s. Despite the strides Washington has made for racial inequality in the entertainment industry, media outlets continue to lighten photographs of African American celebrities in an attempt to whitewash talent. Most recently, Washington’s photo on the February cover of InStyle magazine portrays her skin as significantly lighter than it actually is. By purportedly lightening the color of her skin, InStyle diminished Washington’s achievements as a African American woman and the accomplishments black people have made before her. Magazine publications should send positive messages to their readers, and altering celebrities’ appearance to conform to culturally established notions of beauty does not serve that purpose.
Though one-third of the United States population consists of people of color, Hollywood continues to underrepresent racial minorities in film productions and television shows. Because of this lack of diversity, women of color are rarely featured in magazines — but when they are severely lightened or altered. As one of the few African American protagonists on a major television series, Washington should be depicted as the powerful African American woman she is instead of the common white actress. By featuring African American celebrities, magazines can help provide women of color icons with whom they might identify.
Additionally, by highlighting a celebrity’s ethnic heritage, magazines would declare that race is not something rooted in shame. Instead of ignoring the struggles women of color have overcome to even appear on the front page of a magazine, major publications should focus on these issues during the interview portion, starting more conversations about racial representation in Hollywood.
Magazines are not the only outlets under fire for skin-lightening. Advertisement companies are notorious for promoting unrealistic standards of beauty, ultimately destroying a young woman’s self-confidence. Similar how the depiction of a thin model might influence young women to develop eating disorders, lightening an African American women’s skin can lead other African American women to consider bleaching their own skin. By endorsing impractical beauty ideals, advertisement companies are profiting from the adverse effects on impressionable young women.
Washington is not the only celebrity who has been subject to the cruel retouching of their skin. Despite garnering one of the largest fan bases on television, multitalented celebrity Beyoncé was almost unrecognizable in a recent L’Oréal ad. The cosmetic company’s depiction of Beyoncé with lighter skin and blonde hair was a deliberate attempt to make her more relatable to a white customer. In addition, actress Lupita Nyong’o’s skin was visibly lighter in a photo shoot for Vanity Fair.  Though she was featured in the magazine because of her work in 12 Years a Slave, a film that illustrates the gruesome nature of slavery, the magazine lightened her skin, wasting the opportunity for a national conversation on the new idea of dark-skin beauty.
Though magazines and advertising companies have a mass market, very few take the opportunity to discuss real issues. With all the attention, they have the potential to make a difference in the ways people view celebrities and ultimately, themselves. Rather than promote unrealistic standards and profit off of people’s insecurities, media outlets should create a more realistic standard of beauty by minimizing the use of Photoshop and similar tools. Furthermore, they should encourage open discussion on racial issues in the entertainment industry, making women of color more comfortable with themselves. Though readers have become more cognizant of the racism portrayed by the media, magazines and ad agencies must follow suit in order to truly eradicate these unrealistic and horrible standards of stereotypical beauty.

With all the attention paid to the Oscars this weekend, it was easy to miss the other award show that took place. The 35th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards gave out its recognitions to the worst movies of the year. Started in 1981 by copywriter and publicist John J. B. Wilson to “honor” the very worst in film, the award show has established itself as the mostly ignored, tongue-in-cheek counterpart to the Oscars. It has been bashed and heavily criticized, but beyond the fun of calling out the worst films every year, it does the important job of reminding us not to take the Oscars too seriously.
The Oscars, with all its excitement and glamour, are a very flawed institution. The winners often fail to reflect both the tastes of the public and the critics, and often reveal a very out-of-touch voting base. Any institution that awards Rocky the big prize over Taxi Driver, All The President’s Men and Network — to use a better example than the tired Crash over Brokeback Mountain from 2006 — is one whose decisions shouldn’t be taken as the final word on the best in film. Just this year, there were strong criticisms about the demographics of the Oscars nominees in the wake of perceived snubs to lead actor David Oyelowo and director Ana DuVernay for their work in Selma. Now, anyone can vote for a Razzie as long as they pay the $40 membership fee to be part of the Golden Raspberry Foundation. Despite the pall of illegitimacy that such ease of entry seems to cast over the Razzies, it would be difficult to make an argument that their choices are objectively worse than those made by the members of the Academy.
On March 31, 1981, the first Golden Raspberry Awards were held. They took place in Wilson’s house and about three dozen people were in attendance to witness the inaugural Worst Picture award go to Can’t Stop the Music. That same day, one of the biggest Oscars injustices happened when the good-but-not-great Ordinary People beat Martin Scorcese’s masterful Raging Bull. Going off of Rotten Tomatoes alone as an objective metric of critical recognition, Raging Bull’s colossal 98 percent rating towers over People’s 92 percent. But Can’t Stop the Music was indeed the worst-rated film out of the 10 nominees with its 8 percent edging out Saturn 3’s 10.
That year is only one data point, and the Razzies are not trying to set themselves up as a better authority on quality in film than the Oscars. But that is the point. The Razzies do not take themselves seriously in the slightest. They often make joke nominations and break their own rules. For example, this year’s winners for Worst Screen Combo were “Kirk Cameron and his ego in Saving Christmas,” beating out “Kellan Lutz and either his abs, his pecs or his glutes in The Legend of Hercules” and “Any two robots, actors (or robotic actors) in Transformers: Age of Extinction.” Those aren’t the nominations of an award show that takes itself seriously. The level of humor is lowbrow to match the quality of the films it so studiously judges. But, despite the lack of seriousness in the Golden Raspberry Foundation, it can’t be stressed enough that the Razzies consistently do a much better job at declaring the worst in film than the Oscars do at declaring the best.
Perhaps it is the lack of seriousness that allows the Razzies to be more accurate. With so many eyeballs pointed in the Oscars’ direction and so many voices speaking breathlessly about the prestige of the Academy, it is easy for decisions to get muddled by politics and ideas about who is “due.” Al Pacino won his only Oscar in 1993 for Scent of a Woman over arguably superior performances by Denzel Washington in Malcolm X and Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven. But the perception of that award was that Pacino was only being rewarded because his best performances were all snubbed, most notably his smoldering performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II being passed over for Art Carney’s unforgettable performance in Harry and Tonto. He was perceived as “due” in ’93 so he got the award he should’ve gotten in ’75. You can bet that Academy members will be hearing every proclamation that Leonardo DiCaprio should have won an Oscar already the next time he’s nominated, even if it’s an inferior part.
There is no clamoring for an actor not receiving his deserved statuette in an award show that nobody watches. Just as there is no uproar when none of the nominees are people of color, as was the case this year when out of 20 acting nominees, only Shaquille O’Neal was a person of color. Everyone knows the Razzies are a joke, so they are not put under a magnifying glass and dissected like the Oscars are. This frees them to make their selections in peace and allows for a more accurate selection of winners.
And yet, what little attention the Razzies manage to get is usually negative. It’s understandable. Studios and actors want their bombs swept under the rug and forgotten, instead of paraded around as the gold standard of how bad movies can get. But we should not be too quick to dismiss the yearly reminder of things like the fact that the man who beat Taxi Driver, Network and All The President’s Men in 1977 went on to win a record four Razzies for Worst Actor (including three Worst Supporting Actor nods, Sly has managed to be nominated for a whopping 17 acting Razzies). It is all a bit absurd, but it’s all in good fun. It is also not a condemnation, which is another complaint against the awards. Many Razzie winners are actually quite talented and it should not be a bad thing to call them out when they sign up for a film for the paycheck. For example, Adam Sandler openly admitted that he did Blended in order to get a vacation to Africa. His Razzie nomination should almost be expected with motivations like that.
Some actors have a sense of humor about it. Sandra Bullock attended the ceremony in 2010 and accepted her Razzie for All About Steve the night before she accepted her Oscar for The Blind Side. She was one of three people to win both a Razzie and an Oscar in the same year. Another was Brian Helgeland, who won the Razzie for The Postman and the Oscar for L.A. Confidential the next day. He accepted the award, wishing to display them together as an example of “the quixotic nature of Hollywood.”
Hollywood can get downright bizarre and anyone who celebrates it needs to celebrate that as well. The Oscars are great fun and it’s always a treat to see all the stars out together. But to treat them with reverence is a bit silly. The Razzies are a constant, farcical reminder of this.

Cassell’s Hamburgers reopened a few blocks down from the original location on 6th Street, and patrons are eager to welcome the restaurant back.
Since its original establishment in 1948, the burger stand founded by Al Cassell has been a popular spot for patrons who enjoy classic and quality American burgers served at a relaxed, diner-like setting. Now, a few years after its closing, Christian Page, a former chef at Short Order, brought the restaurant back on the ground floor of Hotel Normandie in Koreatown. Paying homage to Cassell and his original stand, burgers at the new Cassell’s Hamburgers are, according to the restaurant’s website, “cooked on Al Cassell’s famous original crossfire broiler, ground with the original grinder, and pattied with the original press.” The new Cassell’s has some additions, such as house-made sodas, a bar and a classic ’50s breakfast option.
Cassell’s is a short, convenient 15-minute drive for USC students. The interior of the restaurant creates a laid-back, retro and hipster atmosphere. The lifted ceiling, large windows and clean white walls combine for a modern, cafe-like feel. By contrast, the old signage, menu boards and wooden tables and chairs transport customers to a typical ’50s diner ambience. Staying true to the classic diner-style food, side dishes are served on a silver tray with a piece of red and white paper wrapped around. The mix of modern decor and retro elements enable customers to experience quality burgers in a relaxing and novel environment.
As Page told the Los Angeles Times, the new Cassell’s is “not chef-centered.” According to Page, “If anyone is the chef here, it’s Al Cassell and the spirit of him. Just doing our best to do things the way he would.”
And how would Al Cassell do it? A classic, American burger with simple ingredients — and most importantly, no french fries.
The cheeseburger comes with a beef patty, the choice of either Swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce, fresh onions, a piece of tomato, pickles and Thousand Island dressing. Aside from the patty and the cheese, all ingredients are served on the side. Bacon and a fried egg can be added to the burger for $2.50 and $1.50, respectively. For customers who want extra meat, the burger is offered in a larger size with 2/3⅔pounds instead of 1/3.
The patty, which is cooked medium, is perfectly juicy on the inside and seared crispy on the outside. Thanks to the chef’s insistence on staying true to the original Cassell’s burger, the beef patty tastes fresh and savory. It has the quality of a gourmet burger but the diner price of $11.99. For customers who prefer their meat well done, medium-well is a good option. The burger comes with a lot of lettuce — so much that you could make a lettuce wrap and omit the bun to save calories. The generous portion of lettuce definitely helps neutralize the greasy taste of the patty. The Thousand Island dressing on the side is tangy and mustard-like. The bacon, though too salty, is chewy and not overly greasy. Overall, the cheeseburger is classic American-style and very delicious — no big surprises.
Instead of french fries, the burgers and sandwiches come with the choice among a few small side dishes, including homemade potato chips, Thousand Island dressing, potato salad, coleslaw and pasta salad. Though it can be a little disappointing not to have fries with a burger, these side dishes are good without being too heavy. The pasta salad and the coleslaw are good, but not particularly special. The potato salad, though, with a small amount of mayonnaise and some spicy mustard, is delicious and popular.
As for drinks, the old-fashioned lemonade goes pretty well with the burger. It’s neither too sweet, nor too sour. The cream house soda, however, has a strange taste. It has an Oreo-like sweetness that doesn’t complement the bubbly soda. For those who would like a more traditional burger-joint drink, the shakes and malts are definitely worth a try. Cassell’s also offers freshly baked desserts such as custards and pies.
The pricing of menu items is fairly reasonable, as the burgers and sandwiches are no more than what one would pay for at a diner. The quality of the food and the friendly atmosphere make it more than just a dining experience.  Page has done a great job bringing back the classic L.A. burger joint with some additions to the old menu. Next time you’re around Koreatown, take a trip back in time at Cassell’s by treating yourself to a good old cheeseburger with a delicious side of potato salad.

I once saw a particularly astute bumper sticker on the car of an outspoken high school science teacher. It read: “Support stem cell research; grow Bush a brain.” Though hyperbolic — we’ve yet to actually grow an entire brain from stem cells — the sticker effectively conveyed the sense of frustration that has characterized the decades-long dispute between religious conservatives and scientists seeking to advance medicine through research on embryonic stem cells. In 2009, the Obama administration reversed Bush-era restrictions on federal research funding, but legislation dating back to 1996 continues to slow progress on the topic. States such as California and Connecticut have emerged as hotbeds of state-funded studies on ES cells. For such a promising area of research, however, the lack of full federal support causes a tremendous impediment toward medical advancement and the patients who rely on it.
Stem cells are something of a blank check for bodily mechanics, endowed with a complete genetic code but not yet committed to a specific expression of that code. In other words, every stem cell can potentially adopt more specialization — as a brain cell or muscle cell, or any of the 200 other types of human cells. When placed among tissue-specific cells like neurons, stem cells assume that form. Thus, they are incredibly valuable in the regeneration of damaged organs, and their utility has been proven through the renewal of bone marrow and cardiac muscles. Researchers believe that further experimentation could yield cures for such intractable diseases as Parkinson’s or diabetes. Another remarkable quality of stem cells is their capacity to divide and renew themselves for long periods of time. This allows scientists to proliferate many generations of stem cells from a common embryo, which forms what is known as a “stem cell line” and ensures the possibility of long-term research.
But the grand promise of stem cell therapy has not been without its complications. Occasionally these have manifested in the form of scientific misconduct, such as last year, when the journal Nature retracted a heavily flawed paper that implied a simple acid bath could turn specialized cells back into stem cells. More persistently, the slow progress of stem cell research can be attributed to the objections of religious conservatives who protest the destruction of embryos in the attainment of viable stem cells. Most ES cells are derived from embryos that develop from eggs fertilized in vitro. Opponents take issue with what they perceive to be an affront to the sanctity of human life, despite the vast potential for improving the lives of the chronically ill or injured.
Their opponents’ antiquated perspective manifested through policy in 2001 when Bush issued an executive order banning federal funding of research on newly generated ES cell lines. At the time, 71 ES cell lines from 14 laboratories around the world were compliant with Bush’s funding criteria. In practice, only 21 of these lines were of value to researchers. Because these 21 lines were not genetically or ethnically diverse, the scope of research was greatly limited, and scientists engaged in ES cell work had to scramble to secure private funding lest their studies be wasted.
Those opposed to research involving ES cells have encouraged an exploration of adult stem cells. AS cells are undifferentiated cells found in the tissues, usually fat and blood, of grown adults. Seemingly, the existence of AS cells would obviate the dispute over stem cell research. However, fundamental differences exist in the capabilities of ES and AS cells. Most apparent is the ability of ES cells to assume the form and function of all cell types in the body. AS cells are limited in their transformative abilities and can only differentiate into cells of their tissue of origin.
Notable changes in policy since Obama took office have fostered a more robust scientific climate for studying ES cells. Early on during his administration, the president reversed the Bush ban on federal funding, and in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear a case that challenged Obama’s actions. But there is still work to be done. If we hope to remain at the forefront of scientific innovation, congressional action is needed for all-access funding policy for ES cell researchers.
