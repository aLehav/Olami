Only seven students attended the open forum to discuss the next dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences Wednesday. The discussion was led by Mark Todd, vice provost for Academic Operations, who is helping Provost Michael Quick in the search. The goal of this meeting was to get students’ input on what the search committee should be looking for in the next dean.
The advertisement for this position has been released, and applications will continue to be accepted until the end of December. This is an open search, meaning that applications will be considered from both inside and outside of the University. After interviews and campus visits, President C. L. Max Nikias will make the final decision on who to hire for this position.
“It would have to be someone from some of the disciplines in the college,” Todd said. “The college has humanities, social sciences, biological and natural sciences. It’s such a vast academic unit. I think what’s equally important is how this person is going to establish his or her leadership team that can really help with the various challenges or opportunities that exist in these different areas.”
Todd said the new dean would need to be both a respected academic and someone capable of collaborating with the other schools.
According to Todd, Nikias has referred to Dornsife as the “beating heart of the University.” Because of this, the new dean must be a great leader — one who understands the value of teaching, research faculty and will ultimately take the school to the next level of excellence.
Moira Turner, Diversity Affairs director of the Undergraduate Student Government, inquired about the role of diversity in the selection process.
“I am looking at the directory of the deans for Dornsife right now, and I was wondering what you are doing in terms of intentionality to select more people of color and women to fulfill this position,” she said. “I know that sometimes some work practices don’t account for biases that don’t necessarily seek out those kind of representatives from the community, so I’m wondering how you’re going to incorporate diversity in the selection process for the new dean.”
All 11 staff members of the Dean’s Office, including the dean, are white, and only three are women.
“We’re very, very intentional about [increasing diversity],” Todd said. “We put together a selection committee that is as diverse as we could, not just in ethnic diversity, but diversity within the college and faculty who are at different stages in tenure or non-tenure track. We are very sensitive to that. It’s very important.”
Michael Boateng, a junior studying cognitive science, added to this.
“We continue to grow, and there are different genders, races and sexualities that are coming into this University,” he said. “All of these are different trains of thought, and so I hope that the new dean that you choose is another step forward toward someone who can understand this diversity of thought.”
In addition to diversity, students said they want a dean who is accessible, transparent and engaging.
“In my past experience with the deans, it’s been a little difficult for us to see the dean of our college,” Boateng said. “I would like for them to have an itinerary of events of different organizations and clubs that they aim to attend to by the end of the semester. And on top of going to those events, they should provide a report talking about what they learned from these different organizations and clubs that they’ve been to.”
Students ultimately want to know the new dean and have accessibility to him or her. It took a few tries for the seven students to guess the current dean’s name. They finally guessed “Steve Kay” and said that the name “sounded familiar.”
“The dean really needs to be a presence,” Todd said. “It’s really important.”
In order to increase the dean’s accessibility, students suggested weekly office hours or monthly events to discuss topics and concerns with students. The seven attendees also hope that this new dean will provide more research and mentorship opportunities.
“Thank you so much for showing up, but where’s everybody else? What I really hope is that, especially when the candidates come, that the place is packed with people who really want to grill the dean,” Todd said.
Todd emphasized the importance of students in the selection process.
“It’s no small thing. This is your leader, and I really do encourage you guys to play an active role in the selection process. Please encourage everybody to do that,” he said. “You are free to send your thoughts and comments to the provost, and I really hope you do because it’s really important. We want to hear from the students as much as we can.”

Throughout this week, USC’s Sikh Student Association is hosting Sikh Awareness Week. The celebration is aimed at educating students about many facets of Sikhism, a monotheistic religion with roots in the Punjab region of South Asia.
According to SSA President Himmat Singh, the goal for this week is to raise awareness about Sikhs and their faith. Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world, but Sikhs are still often victims of discrimination and violence. Since Sikhism is derived from South Asia and requires Sikhs to wear turbans, Singh said that many confuse the religion for Islam or Hinduism. He hopes that this week’s events will help to educate students across campus.
“It’s really big for us to make an appearance on campus, to show that we are USC students too,” Himmat Singh said. “We’ve had so many students coming up to us, spending those extra minutes listening to our faith and what’s important to us, and that really means a lot.”
SSA kicked off the week on Monday with Sikh artist Amandeep Singh, who goes by the name “Inkquisitive” and creates vibrant editorial and religious art. As part of his Colourfornia tour, Amandeep  Singh created a mural next to SSA’s tent on Trousdale Parkway throughout the day. On Tuesday night, Amandeep Singh presented the piece of art to students and gave a Q&A at Ground Zero Performance Café.
Also on Tuesday, SSA held a turban tying event on Trousdale. Students were able to try on turbans, which are a vital part of the Sikh faith. Sikhs are expected to keep Kesh hair — meaning that they do not cut their hair — and to cover their heads with a turban. The event was meant to relieve negative stigmas surrounding turbans in American culture.
“I think there’s a huge stigma against turbans,” Himmat Singh said. “It helped people see that the turban is respected and that you shouldn’t be afraid of it. It is a symbol that we are really wanting to share with others.”
SSA showed a screening of the classic Sikh film Chaar Sahibzaade on Wednesday night. The film doubled as both entertainment and education, as it told the story of the 10th Sikh Guru and the sacrifices of his four sons. This story is another vital part of Sikhism.
A Seva event will take place Thursday morning, as students are invited to gather on Trousdale at 11:30 a.m. to create cards for terminally ill patients. Seva, which means “work offered to God,” is charity work that makes up a main part of the Sikh practice.
The week will conclude on Friday at Fishbowl Chapel for a night of Kirtan meditation to commemorate the victims of the 1984 Sikh genocide in India. In a series of pogroms, anti-Sikh mobs led by Congress party members attacked Sikhs throughout the country, killing 2,800 people. Friday’s event will educate participants about the specifics of the genocide and end with a celebration of the Sikh culture and faith.
The SSA is hoping that this week will act as a springboard for a year-long campaign to raise Sikh awareness across campus. Himmat Singh is also coordinating with Sikh campus organizations across California, along with working to increase membership at USC. However, he says that the SSA’s focus for the year — and for the foreseeable future — will be raising awareness and stopping negative stigmas.
“You can never stop teaching people about who Sikhs are,” Himmat Singh said. “The more we teach about who we are, the less stigma there is against Sikhs and the less terrible things we’ll see happen around the world. We’re going to keep trying to get out, to educate people and hopefully, we can keep succeeding.”

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted the final California Politics Roundtable discussion of the semester on Wednesday featuring an expert panel who spoke about different sustainable energy concepts as well as California’s energy policies and legislation.
The event was titled “Forgetting Fossil Fuels: What’s Next for Alternative Energy in California?” and took place in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The panel, which was hosted jointly between the Unruh Institute and the Political Student Assembly, included Dario Frommer, former California State Assembly Majority Leader from 2004-2006 and a member of the Unruh Institute’s Legislator-in-Residence program, and Ivan Penn, a Los Angeles Times writer with an emphasis in energy.
Kyla Middleton, a junior majoring in political science and the director of political content for PSA, and Ethan Bialick, a senior majoring in business administration and the co-director of the Environmental Core and Go Solar Campaign, served as moderators, while Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, oversaw the discussion. After posing several questions themselves, Middleton and Bialick gave the audience an opportunity to engage with the panel.
As worldwide energy consumption continues to soar, with most of this increase drawn from nonrenewable fossil fuels, some researchers are advocating for a transition away from these sources and toward renewable alternatives to avoid global climate change. Some of these substitutes include solar and wind power. Though both of these options produce no carbon emissions, and thus do not contribute to climate change, there are drawbacks to their implementation.
“Wind and solar are intermittent. They don’t [provide energy] consistently like a natural gas plant, nuclear plant or coal plant,” Penn said.
Penn said that this means that excessive energy production from these sources can create a blackout by surpassing the energy infrastructure’s capacity. On the other hand, conventional nonrenewable sources are often needed to provide energy when production is low, such as at night.
One potential solution to the inconsistent energy supply generated by wind and solar includes large-scale energy storage, something Frommer cites as a potential game-changer.
“Storage is termed the ‘holy grail’ [of energy],” Frommer said.
Frommer explained this is because it allows the excess energy produced during periods of low consumption to be used at a later time. Furthermore, storage can be employed at both macro and micro scales by utility companies and individual households, respectively.
“Storage also puts the consumer in a position where they can come off the grid at an affordable cost,” Frommer said — a development that can potentially revolutionize the energy industry.
Also discussed at the event were California’s energy policies and how they stand out from those of other states.
“California has historically taken bold positions on energy regulations,” Frommer said.
He cited the example of California’s mandated energy efficiency standards for appliances which set the stage for similar federal policies in the future.
“When I was in the Assembly … California became the first state to require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources,” Frommer said. “California is going alone on this program, still leading the way. And now, other states want to follow us. Even other countries have been wanting to follow our example.”
Bialick said the government should not be the primary force behind this shift.
“I’d like to see more push from people and private organizations, as opposed to the government, to make the transition to renewable energy,” he said.
Middleton stressed the importance of citizen engagement.
“It’s important for everyone to be invested in California’s energy practices so that it can continue to be a leader in energy policies,” Middleton said.
The California Politics Roundtable discussions will resume again in January.

Students gathered Wednesday evening in Waite Phillips Hall to discuss the history of Palestine with Rana Sharif, vice president of the Palestinian American Women’s Association.
“Palestine 101: History, Resistance and Activism” was hosted by the USC chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine and cosponsored by the DESI Project, the Muslim Students Union, the Pakistani Students Association, SCALE, UN Ambassadors and SCAPE.
The event centered on the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it relates to the current landscape of Palestinian activism and resistance.
Sharif, in addition to being the VP of PAWA, is a Ph.D. candidate at UCLA and a gender studies professor at Loyola Marymount University.
Sharif began her presentation by explaining that though not everyone in the room was going to agree with what would be said, they should still think on the meaning of resistance and what it entails.
During her presentation, Sharif highlighted the key moments that have led to where Palestine stands now.
“I have categorized three significant Palestinian [historical moments] from which I will discuss,” Sharif said. “The first being prior to 1948, the second moment of Palestinian organizing comes between 1948 and 1967 and the third is the contemporary moment we find ourselves a part of which began in 1967.”
Sharif touched on several topics such as Palestinian woman activists and what is now being called a third intifada — which means “to shake off” or uprising — in Palestine and the struggles of those living with the conflict.
“Recently, The Guardian’s  Phoebe Greenwood traveled to the West Bank to document what various media outlets and Palestinians are calling this ‘third intifada,’” Sharif said. “In her account, she was surprised by the growing number of young Palestinian women joining the shabab movement, a movement of young men activists taking to the streets arming themselves with slingshots and pebbles. During this ‘third intifada,’ young university and high school students comprise the majority of its body.”
Sharif explained that the third intifada, also known as the Al-Quds intifada, is the one that began earlier this year.
“This ‘third intifada’ draws on new digital technologies such as Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter to organize and mobilize,” she said.
After the presentation, Sharif opened up the floor to questions.
“I’m Palestinian, and I have family in Palestine. At this point, you can’t kick out the Israelis and you can’t kick out the Palestinians, so I wonder what the solution might be,” said Mohamed El-Farra, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies.
Sharif proposed a one-state solution.
“One of the most practical and perhaps popular answers is a one-state solution, where everyone has equal access to the entire state,” she said. “However, there are a lot of people who find that to be a very contentious statement.”
She responded to a question regarding mainstream media not depicting the full picture of what is going on in Gaza and the West Bank.
“Mainstream media creates many narratives which take away from the context and substance of what’s really happening. Whether you’re left-leaning or right-leaning or a centrist, any sort of media space that you view is something that needs to be critiqued and challenged,” Sharif said.
Students noted the diversity of those interested in this contentious issue.
“It was great to see people from all ethnicities and races in attendance,” El-Farra said. “To be honest, I thought it was going to be mostly Arabs at the event, but I’m glad that that was not the case.”

Bieber Fever · The Canadian music prodigy Justin Bieber returns with his new record, Purpose, after athree-year hiatus. Bieber will embark on a 58-day world tour starting on March 9, at KeyArena at Seattle Center. – Photo courtesy of Island Records
Questions concerning Justin Bieber’s dormant musical career have circulated these last few months as the singles “Where Are Ü Now” and “What Do You Mean?” were released as a tease for his new album, Purpose, which is set to be released this Friday. By collaborating with Skrillex and up-and-coming DJ Blood Pop, Bieber debuts a refined dance pop style on his track list of 19 songs. Songs like “Sorry,” the third single to be released from the album, illustrate enthusiastic and upbeat vibes that represent his desire to produce music again.
In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, the 21-year-old artist said, “[I want to] create the best piece of art that I can create, something that’s really near and dear to my heart. I know there’s a lot of stuff that I’ve been going through over the past few years. I just really want to bleed it on this record.”
Bieber’s honesty in his music stems from the hardships he has dealt with over the last two years, including his perplexing former relationship with singer Selena Gomez. The single “Sorry” is rumored to be a public apology to his ex-girlfriend, as the chorus indicates, but is featured with a playful tune: “Is it too late now to say sorry? / Cause I’m missing more than just your body.” He admits that Gomez was the muse for part of the song, along with “What Do You Mean?” and the album’s first track, “Mark My Words.”
As the “Baby” singer opens up about his personal life, the words behind Purpose are marked with a purpose of their own — to shut down the haters and reveal the real Justin Bieber. In the fourth song released from the album, “I’ll Show You,” Bieber opens up by singing, “My life is a movie and everyone’s watching / So let’s get to the good part, and past all the nonsense.” He wants his listeners to look past what the paparazzi has to say about him and believe in the truth of his lyrics — the same message he was promoting with his third studio album, Believe, which came out in 2012.
Prior to the album release, Bieber has already shown signs of success with his new music as “What Do You Mean?” nailed the No. 1 spot of the Billboard Hot 100 during its first week, the first time this has happened in his musical career and only the 23rd time this has happened in Billboard history. The other released songs from Purpose, “Sorry” and “I’ll Show You,” are currently ranked No. 4 and No. 51, respectively.
The singer plans on heightening the success of the new album with special guest features, including Travis Scott, Big Sean and an exclusive remix of “What Do You Mean?” with Ariana Grande. Contradictory to Bieber’s longstanding manager Scooter Braun’s concern about Bieber “[shutting] himself off and [going] into a dark place” as he told Billboard, the singer has picked himself back up and put all his efforts into a purposeful comeback just for his fans. The songs on the album not only serve as outlets into his private life, but also as expressions of gratitude for his fans who have supported him from his first album, My World, until now.
Purpose has high aspirations of becoming a platinum record, with personal connections and upbeat tracks. The album will be an experience listeners can relate to when hearing the new songs. For those wanting an even more immersive experience, Bieber will be holding a Q&A session and performing his new songs at the Staples Center Friday.

Wallaby damned · Columnist Nika Shahery approaches a wallaby. Journeying throughout Tasmania allows for many chances to engage with wildlife, especially marsupials like wallabies and kangaroos. – Nika Shahery | Daily Trojan
From the moment I decided to study abroad in Australia, I hoped to see a kangaroo. A road trip to Tasmania helped me achieve that goal. In fact, that trip helped me engage with the natural elements of Australia I thought only existed in postcards.
Before leaving for Tassi or Tas, as it is affectionately referred to by Aussies, I decided I would limit the amount of research I would conduct beforehand so I could truly experience the land without any pre-existing biases. I had only overheard, from people who had visited or were from Tas, that the state was supposedly green, beautiful and filled with animals. However, the one thing I thought I should glance at was how to treat spider bites, as I had a premonition that city life had insulated me from these types of incidents.
My friends and I only had a starting city, Launceston, and an ending city, Hobart. The excursion was spontaneous, and we were open to what we saw along the drive to fill the days. We arrived in Launceston late one night and dealt with lodging and minimally explored the ghost-like city.
That night, we laid down in the park and stared at the numerous stars sparkling in the barely polluted sky. I had never studied constellations, but my friends pointed out how strange it was that the Big Dipper and Orion’s Belt were flipped, due to our location in the Southern Hemisphere. This realization made us incredibly grateful for what we were experiencing, and we felt so small compared to the boundless constellations.
We hit the road for the next two days, driving through scenes of wild horses, cows, sheep, hens and other farm animals grazing through brilliant green pastures and rocky creeks sprinkled the street borders. Each turn deserved a photo and no crevice was left unvisited.
The bays in particular were something extraordinary. The powdery white sand, paired with the gradient crystal ocean, set the perfect scene that looked only achievable through use of a filter. The ice-cold water was the best cure for sore feet after a long hike from the mountains to the bay—in that day’s case, Wineglass Bay.
On the hike, I made the best kind of friend you can make in Australia: the wallaby. Similar to a kangaroo, these medium-sized marsupials are all over down under. However, the ones around the Bay were like little puppies and had no fear of approaching people, probably to try and grab their food.
At the campsite I was met with some great fears. The first, a display of spiders in the bathroom, genuinely looked unlike any of the spiders I had ever seen. One in particular was transparent white, and I narrowed my gaze on the little pest.
My second fear, though, was far worse. With the knowledge that I have a reasonable fear of snakes, a friend lifted a fake one up and began to advance my way. I saw and heard nothing but the snake for the next couple of minutes, screaming in terror, throwing my water bottle and doing just about anything to keep my distance. At one point another friend launched it in my direction. Suddenly, laughter muted my terror. The prank worked so well I convinced myself into a panic attack, blind to my friends who were bent over the entire time. I met their laughter, but with simultaneous tears. Of my crazy animal encounters thus far, and I have had a few, I still rank the fake red snake as a top one.
My subsequent animal meetings were more positive. At the Tasmanian Devil UnZoo, we watched Tasmanian Devils run around with a shared piece of meat while the keeper told us about their breeding and reintroduction efforts that are saving the threatened species. We also watched some hilarious quolls, squirrel-like marsupials, leap across tree branches in a chaotic acrobatic performance. And of course, I got to see mobs of kangaroos with their joeys. The animals proved a formidable rival to the views of Tas.
We ended our road trip with a visit to Port Arthur, a 19th century detention center for
male repeat offenders. The restoration coupled with the lush greenery made it hard to imagine that the place was once a hellish penitentiary island that featured no walls to keep prisoners in. The history of the prison reform in the facility through the years was truly fascinating. Additionally, the site houses a beautiful memorial for the 32 who were massacred at the location in 1996, an event that continually affects many even today.
The days I spent in Tasmania were unlike any others. While there, I marveled at the beauty with every breath I took. The nature and history there reminds me of the limited access to these sites. In fact, it reminded me how easy it is to forget that nature is not necessarily eternal. It is a shame today that so many look to the sky and mistake planes for stars. Everyone should reconnect with nature,  just as I did in Tasmania.

It’s around 5 p.m. on a Thursday night, and there are powerful voices blaring through a microphone speaker echoing through McCarthy Quad. Several workers’ union protesters are aligned in a circle urging passersby to acknowledge their need for higher compensation. While several students stop to join the crowd, others simply laugh, snapchatting or taking photos of the seemingly peculiar sight. A few are even fleeing away as quickly as they can from the scene in fear of involvement. 
And there I found myself cautiously approaching the quad, trying to understand my boundaries as a journalist. I soon realized that this very process of understanding and discovering my journalistic boundaries would be an adventure throughout my undergraduate career. And as a former news editor and current deputy features editor and columnist, I wanted to take you through what really happens behind the scenes of breaking news, investigative and long-form pieces, and the Daily Trojan’s supplement issue. Stay tuned. 
The emotions of those participating in the protest were palpable — it was as though you could feel their tears and anger in the air. I was in my American Politics class and left early to cover the unexpected event. To be quite frank, for Trojans, 5 p.m. is one of the busiest times of day, and there was no one else who could cover the event. 
So, as I tensely began to join the crowd of protestors, not knowing who to speak to or what to do. I began to realize the importance of understanding the depths of emotion for those protesting. I put myself in their shoes, wondering how I would best react to a journalist covering the event. That simple shift in mind was a crucial turning point not only for better coverage of this specific story, but for the rest of my journalistic career. And while news is objective, speaking and interacting with individuals is not. It could not have been a more perfect time for me to have experienced this event. 
Though I initially approached the scene with caution, I left with confidence. As I joined the circle and interacted with protesters, I learned their why: the significant reason that motivates them to be a part of such a movement. The relationships I built after leaving the event allowed me to connect with the protestors to the point where my later interviews were raw, real and comfortable.
Just a few weeks later, the Daily Trojan’s supplement, “On the Money” was released. The supplement was a special issue highlighting the wage disputes on campus, in addition to various large-scale monetary projects at USC. This falls directly under the kinds of stories I assign to writers and cover myself as the deputy features editor. This semester has been a whirlwind, to say the least. For the most part, my role includes a lot of brainstorming for special articles in news, lifestyle, sports and, sometimes, even editorial so that issues not traditionally seen in the paper can be highlighted. 
If there’s one thing I could say about this role, it would be how amazing it is to closely work with the other talented editors on our editorial board. For example, current Editorial Director Sonali Seth and I are working on an in-depth story on the gender pay gap among professors on campus and Multimedia Editor Kay Angrum and Design Director Sam Lee constantly produce amazing graphic content in correspondence with the lifestyle articles. But my job requires me to constantly interact with the other section editors such as Sports Editors Darian Nourian and Regan Estes to pitch sports ideas and work with their specific team of writers. This constant interaction with other sections for is what was void from my role as the news editor in terms of producing content across the board. Like most traditional papers, the news section is separate from other sections to avoid any sense of biased reporting. And while the editorial board is a tight-knit group, we do our best to avoid any sort of opinion-based discussion for large on-campus disputes. So, the shift from news to features has been a different — albeit an invaluable way — to expand my scope of knowledge as a journalist and as an editor for the paper. 
I might have only discussed one story that truly impacted my journalism career, but there are several others that have shaped my time working for the paper. Just know that behind every paper is the blood, sweat and tears of our committed editorial board. And, also note that every time we see students and colleagues picking up the paper, we know our job is done. Because each and every paper covers stories that are intended to bring to light what really happens on campus.

Some thought it would never happen, and many others were unsure. After seven years, Bethesda Softworks gave no indication that it was making a sequel to its universally acclaimed hit Fallout 3. Then, out of nowhere, Fallout 4 was announced, and fans rejoiced. The hype surrounding the game was overwhelming, and the pressure was on Bethesda to meet that hype with a product that exceeded expectations — and it did. Fallout 4 offers players freedom on a scale that has never been achieved before, a vast and alive universe to explore and quirks that distinguish the series’ individuality.
Fallout 4 is set in the far future of 2287 in the Commonwealth, where the world is on the brink of nuclear war due to natural resources running out and overpopulation. The player controls a man or woman during 2077 in a 50s-like suburb who is forced to immediately evacuate to a bomb shelter called a “vault” once nuclear bombs start to drop in the area. The player emerges from the vault 210 years later to find that the apocalypse has left the world barren, but intact, with creatures and humans both friendly and hostile.
The game then lets players explore the world at their own pace. Something that Bethesda is known for is the unparalleled freedom in its games, and this is abundant in Fallout 4. Right from the start,  players have the ability to make an exact replica of themselves with a realistic facial-sculptor that can form any facial feature to players’ liking in absurd detail. Aside from customizing players, faces and bodies, players are able to customize their weapons and physical apparel. Once the player is in the main game world, he or she is given an overwhelming amount of things to do and explore.
The easiest way to explore the world is through quests, which usually have the player completing tasks for other people that contribute to the overall story arc of the game, but they can also complete side quests that deal with other factions or characters. Quests can be completed in a variety of ways that are ultimately up to the player. For instance, one quest has a player assist a group of survivors from attacking bandits. Players have the option of just leaving altogether and coming back another time if they feel like it. Or, players can lend their assistance and repel the attacking bandits, but they can also wait it out and let the two groups battle it out on their own and collect the supplies off of the dead.
The consequences of that, however, can be costly. Players could miss out on new additions to their custom settlements. At these settlements, players can build their own houses, complete with furniture and decorations. The more a settlement becomes developed, the more populated it becomes, so players need to provide resources such as food and water. Unfortunately, the prosperity of a settlement also attracts trouble, and players need to construct turrets, traps and have the best personnel available to defend the settlement. All of these developments and weapon customizations are built from junk that players find in the wasteland, so every item, no matter how trivial it may seem, carries importance.
Players could also miss out on a quest that someone could have given them. In addition, players may find that a quest they complete takes a totally different trajectory if that survivor is dead. Remember, all of this can result from just one quest, and they seem unlimited in the game. If this sounds confusing, it’s because it is, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. This might intimidate casual gamers though, and the lack of a “right” way to do things might make them feel uneasy with the consequences that result from any choice, but hardcore gamers will relish in the fact that their choices actually have an impact on the world around them, and they will see that it is in fact a living, breathing world.
The post-apocalyptic Commonwealth is unique, but Bethesda was still able to replicate Boston and many of its famous and less famous landmarks, buildings and characteristics, which many Bostonians will take delight in. The Paul Revere statue, Old North Church, the Bunker Hill monument, the Massachusetts State House and many more are all in the game, and players can see first-hand how the apocalypse has worn down these timeless monuments and how Bethesda has applied its special treatment to them to reflect their personality.
Bethesda has put its own idiosyncrasies into the game in a number of ways that are trademark to the series. The most notable is how out of modern time everything looks. Despite being in the future, the music of the pre-war societies are all reminiscent of ’40s and ’50s culture. Before the bombs dropped, suburbs had picket fences and green lawns. Men wore suits and fedoras; women wore dresses that nearly hit their ankles. The
in-game radio plays hits from Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and
doo-wop stars. For a society that’s so far into the future, it’s ironic that it resembles something so far in the past, but it works. Wandering around a
post-apocalyptic wasteland to the tunes of big-band swing is oddly beautiful. The game also has a lot of black humor. There’s a scene where a man’s head is vaporized by security forces in a town when he gets too restless, and bystanders don’t give a second glance to the incident. It may be off-putting to some, but to others, it’s the perfect way to approach the subject of near-annihilation of the entire human race from devices of our own making.
Fallout 4 is a game that inspires others game-makers to rise to the level of quality that it produces. Players will find that it’s easy to drop hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing this game due to its individual freedom and expansive, living world. The unusual but oddly fitting charms that the game  offers make this game unique, but it is still a familiar entry into the series. Fallout 4 is a game that can’t be missed and is the greatest installment that Bethesda Softworks has made to date.

Nationally ranked · Senior Giuliana Olmos currently ranks No. 10 in the nation in singles. She had a standout season for the Women of Troy last spring and finished the year as an ITA All-American. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
A pair of women’s tennis players will head east to play in the 2015 ITA/USTA Indoor National Championship, in Flushing, New York, beginning Thursday.
Senior Giuliana Olmos, who ranks No. 10 in the nation in singles, and sophomore Gabby Smith will represent the Trojans at the ITA  National Indoor National Championship, which will be hosted by Columbia University and will take place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The yearly contest features men and women’s 32 singles draws and 20 team doubles draws. Among those draws will be some of the nation’s best collegiate tennis players.
Olmos will be playing in the women’s Singles main event as a wildcard. She will team up with Smith for the women’s doubles main event, where they will enter as an at-large selection.
In last year’s ITA/USTA Indoor National Championship, Olmos faltered in the first round to Caroline Price of North Carolina in two sets (7-5, 6-1), in the women’s singles main draw. Following this, she competed in the women’s singles consolation draw, where she lost a second round battle to Cal’s Zsofi Susanyi in three sets (6-4, 3-6, 6-2).
In the women’s doubles main event, Olmos and Smith suffered a second round defeat to Texas A&M’s Ines Deheza and Rachel Pierson (6-4, 6-4).
They pair did not fare any better in the Women’s Doubles 2nd round Consolation, where they fell to Michigan’s Emina Bektas and Alexandra Najarian in three hard fought sets (5-7, 7-6(2), 10-8).
Despite their struggles in last season’s ITA/USTA Indoor National Championship, this doubles pairing has a successful past. Last season, Smith and Olmos finished with a 9-2 record after bringing home titles from the ITA Southwest Regional Championship and the Jack Kramer Classic.
Most recently, the duo won the 2015 Oracle/ITA  Masters Doubles competition, triumphing over Kentucky’s then top-10 rated team in two decisive sets (6-2, 6-2).
Smith and Olmos will hope to recapture the women’s doubles title at Flushing Meadows that has escaped USC since 2012, when Kaitlyn Christian and Sabrina Santamaria triumphed for the second time.

As the Trojans gear up to hit the road to take on the Colorado Buffaloes on Friday night, they will be playing in a climate very different from that of their home base.
The frigid temperatures in Boulder are a far cry from the sunny, warm days in Los Angeles, but interim head coach Clay Helton does not consider that an excuse for poor performance from his players.
“We’ve always taken the approach of we don’t make excuses, whatever the factors are out there,” Helton said. “They pay us to find the answers, not make excuses.”
The high in Boulder on Friday is projected to be 53 degrees, but temperatures are expected to fall below freezing by gametime. The plan, especially in the high altitude, is to substitute more frequently.
“It should be a really nice night for football, especially with no precipitation,” Helton said. “With the altitude, you’ve always got to get used to it to go up there, but [Colorado’s] got to play in it, too. We’ve got plenty of depth right now that I think we can roll guys in. If it turns into a 100-play offensive game for them, we’re going to have to roll a lot of guys. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.”
USC has played in near-freezing temperatures this season already when the team lost to Notre Dame, 41-31, in South Bend back on Oct. 17.
Helton described redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler’s clever strategy to get acclimated to the weather, something that Matt Barkley also did during his time under center at USC.
“They’ve got the bag of ice out there, freezing their hand up and throwing with their hand being cold all week,” Helton said. “That’s kind of a ritual around here.”
USC is 4-0 all-time at Colorado and 9-0 overall. The last time the Trojans played in Boulder was in 2013, when Kessler completed 19-of-28 passes and threw for 184 yards and two touchdowns in 29-degree weather.
“We really feel like we operated effectively the last time we were there,” Helton said. “We’re not going to use [the weather] as an excuse.”
At practice on Wednesday, the Trojans focused on defending the red zone in what is expected to be a high-scoring affair.
“We focused on our red zone, which is going to be critical against a very good offense,” Helton said. “The bend but don’t break defense and, offensively, scoring touchdowns instead of field goals.”
On the injury front, redshirt senior running back Tre Madden will not play, sidelined with a bone bruise in his knee. Madden has been playing through an injury and saw limited action in USC’s win last week against Arizona. His absence will place a heavier load on USC’s other featured tailbacks, freshman Ronald Jones II and junior Justin Davis.
“[Madden’s] knee right now is still hurting,” Helton said. “We decided we’re going to rest him this week and reevaluate next week. It may be a couple week thing. We’ll have to see. At this point in time, we want to get him 100 percent healthy.”
Madden will travel with the team, however, with Helton hoping to utilize the senior as a leader and a mentor.
“He’s too good of a leader,” Helton said. “He keeps me sane. There’s no way he won’t sit right beside me on the plane. He’ll be assistant head coach this week.”
Redshirt senior defensive end Claude Pelon, who has a knee injury, and redshirt sophomore center Khaliel Rodgers, who has a shoulder injury, are expected to play. According to Helton, Pelon will be limited to 15-30 snaps on Friday.
Helton also revealed that freshman linebacker John Houston Jr., an All-American last season for Junipero Serra High School, is undergoing rehab for a back injury that carried over from high school. Houston Jr., a four-star recruit, was the top-ranked inside linebacker by ESPN coming out of high school.

For the first time in almost 10 years, I had a “wow” moment while watching USC football. What constitutes a “wow” moment, you might ask?
First, we need to look at other examples of past “wow” moments. Reggie Bush’s explosive run against Fresno State, Kobe Bryant dropping 81 on the Raptors, Madison Bumgarner winning the World Series on two days’ rest: all key examples of ”wow” moments.
To put it simply, it’s that moment when you jump out of your seat, look at the person next to you and go, “Wow, that was crazy.” Or, in other cases, it’s that’s play that you will tell your kids about in 20 years.
Those type of moments were all too familiar during the Pete Carroll era. Whether it was Reggie Bush pulling off an incredible run, Matt Leinart placing a beautiful pass or Ray Maualuga knocking the living crap out of UCLA quarterback Patrick Cowan, the Trojans were all about the highlight plays.
I’m not saying that the Trojans lacked star players after Carroll’s departure, but there was no Reggie, Leinart or Clay Matthews from 2010-2015.
The Trojans certainly had their fair share of quality players. Matt Barkley had a stellar 2011 season, Marqise Lee exploded onto the scene and won the Biletnikoff award and Buck Allen had a career year last season with 1,489 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns.
For as great as those players were — they’re all in the NFL now — none of them had the same lasting effect of the previous Carroll era standouts.
Thankfully for the Trojans, and us fans too, this season has provided us with a litany of potential stars. JuJu Smith-Schuster has cemented himself as a top receiver, Su’a Cravens has become the emotional leader of the defense a la Clay Matthews and Adoree’ Jackson has become one of the most explosive two-way players in the game.
Though JuJu, Su’a and Adoree’ have all been great, the player that made me jump out of my seat, turn to the guy next to me and go “wow” was Ronald Jones II.
Ever since Reggie Bush left the school after his junior year, the Trojans have been searching for that next great running back to take the reigns. Despite the recent success of quarterbacks like Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez, USC has always been a running back school.
Don’t believe me? Just look at the numbers sitting atop the Coliseum stairs. Of USC’s seven Heisman winners, five have been running backs: Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen, Charles White and Reggie Bush. That doesn’t factor in other greats such as Anthony Davis, LenDale White and Frank Gifford.
Ronald Jones can be the next great Trojans running back.
Entering the season, Jones figured to be the third back behind returners Tre Madden and Justin Davis. Jones quickly took full advantage of the opportunity handed to him, accumulating 169 yards and two touchdowns in the Trojans’ first two games.
Jones struggled through the next three games, partially due to the fact that he got only eight touches per game. However, after former head coach Steve Sarkisian’s firing, Jones jumped back into the spotlight, highlighted by his breakout performance against Arizona.
Jones rushed for 177 yards, a new freshman record and two touchdowns, one of them being off a 5-yard Kessler pass. It was Jones’ 74 yard run that had me on the edge of my seat. His combination of speed, elusiveness and strength made me go, “Wow. This kid is a freshman. Unreal.”
As it stands, Jones is just 158 yards shy of breaking Charles White’s freshman rushing record. If Jones continues at his current pace, which he should since he just had 177 freaking yards, he’ll not only top that but join elite company as a true freshman 1,000 yard rusher.

Making noise · Freshman running back Ronald Jones II is on pace to break former USC player and Heisman Trophy winner Charles White’s freshman rushing record of 858 yards set in 1976. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
This year, USC is the school of hard knocks. A combination of injuries and sheer talent has resulted in some freshman players learning by being thrown into the fire and responding with memorable in-game performances.
The emergence of Ronald Jones II as one of the most exciting running backs in the country — as a freshman —  accentuates Helton’s dedication to developing USC’s tremendous young talent. And sure, there have been some bumps in the road because of it, but the future looks bright at USC with players like “RoJo” at the wheel.
Last weekend, Jones broke LendDale White’s single-game USC freshman rushing record with 177 yards and a touchdown — one home game after another freshman, Cameron Smith, had three interceptions and a touchdown in the Trojans’ win against then-No. 3 Utah.
“Everybody has got a different timetable. For some freshmen, that light comes on immediately,” Helton said after practice Monday. “I go back and I think about Roberts Woods and the Marqise Lees and the Nelson Agholors — those guys whose light just came on. And right now Ronald’s light is coming on.”
Jones admits that he never imagined he’d be able to knock on the door of the 1,000 rushing mark this season, but added that personal statistics have never been his priority, and that he is more dedicated to helping USC win a championship.
“I honestly thought it would obviously take a little longer,” Jones said.
Jones said that he has heavily relied on the advice he has received throughout the season from veterans like redshirt senior Tre Madden, who has helped break down opposing defenses with him on the field and in film sessions.
“I’m happy to be in the position and role I’m in to help the team,” Jones said.  “Our coaches do a great job of preparing us for any situation, so just with the reps and the experience, I felt myself getting better.”
Jones leads the team with 710 rushing yards and six touchdowns this season on 89 carries. He’s just 148 yards shy of Charles White’s  freshman rushing record, with three games left in the regular season. Helton loves Jones’ commitment to improving his weaknesses which has resulted in his remarkable success.
“Where I am most proud of him, we all knew that he was a great runner, but I really like what he is trying to do with the things that might have been a weakness of his when he first came in — like catching the ball,” Helton said. “He is really focusing on things he wants to get better on … You saw that with that great touchdown catch.”
Since he arrived at USC in the spring, Jones has been working with quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Browne on catching balls from quick passes, which give him more space to utilize his speed. After recording his first receiving touchdown against Arizona, Jones said he feels that his hard work has paid off, and added that his teammates can finally stop questioning his catching ability.
“Now these guys can stop making fun of me. I finally got a receiving touchdown, so it feels good,” Jones said.
Jones said while growing up in Texas, he always loved watching USC and Reggie Bush. Bush’s dual threat of being able to catch the football on top of his running capability inspired him to work on his receiving ability since he got to campus. Consequently, he said there hasn’t been too much that’s changed for him from his life back home except the food: He loves USC, his teammates and playing football everyday.
“The coaches told me that I have to focus on things like time management, but you know other than the food, the transition [from high school to college] has been pretty smooth,” Jones said. “Five Guys is pretty good. Buffalo Spot is one of my favorite places. I miss Hutchins and Whataburger, though.”
Other than Bush, Jones says that the player he emulates most is Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles because of his similar “quick lateral cuts, speed, dreadlocks, No. 25.”
Running back coach Johnny Nansen said that the thing that makes Jones’ running style so unique is his uncanny ability to keep his legs moving, especially after making contact with defenders.
“He’s just Ronald,” Nansen said. “He’s a great kid who works hard every single day on something new.”
He added that once Jones has shaken free from a tackle, he’s immediately looking for more yards and to score.
“It’s just a natural thing that he has got,” Nansen said. “You have to watch him play to see that he never stops his feet on contact; it is hard to bring him down. It is going to take a couple of guys because he is such an aggressive runner.”
Helton, who has served as the team’s offensive coordinator all season, has had the difficult task of dividing the running plays between USC’s five dynamic backs. He says that Jones has a unique combination of size and strength that give him a “phenomenal breakaway speed.” Helton noted that though Jones is 185 pounds, he runs like a big man, which is comparable to the running style of NFL great Roger Craig.
“We call it a horse kick because he will get to that level where all of sudden his legs will explode. It is kind of Roger Craig-ish,” Helton said. “[Jones] won’t know who that is, but it reminds you of that type of leg drive on contact. You know, you see other running backs whose feet die on contact.  He explodes on contact, and he does a really nice job with it.”
Because Jones gets down the football field so quickly, redshirt sophomore wide receiver Steven Mitchell said that he loses track of where Jones has gone — which makes it really hard for him to keep block for him, as was seen on Jones’s long run against Arizona.
“He was actually juking me,” said Mitchell. “I was running down and trying to keep blocking and I really didn’t know where he was. That kid is amazing. I try and make as many blocks as I can.”
Based on what Jones has been able to do on the field so far this season, it appears that he has a bright career ahead of him as a member of the Trojans.

Technology has expanded accessibility of vital information to the average person at the touch of a fingerprint. But in doing so, it has also created the digital divide — the socioeconomic gap between those with access to electronics and those without it. Though the use of technology in schools could level the playing field in education, only those with access to said technology end up sufficiently prepared to attend secondary education. Increasing access by creating media lab environments in schools will allow school districts to provide equal opportunities that 21st century technology can facilitate.
The current standard of education in the United States is rapidly declining. Students experience a disconnect between the real world and their schooling, while also being subjected to higher numbers of mental illness than ever before in classroom environments. Under the dated public school model the nation has been using for the last century or so, students in our country are greatly underperforming in comparison to the rest of the world, ranking 23rd in math, 17th in reading and 32nd in science. The current classroom model was ideal when it was first created, but it has not updated itself to the 21st century. Gone are the days when high school education was enough to be hired in a professional setting, and with that change comes the need for a shift in the public school system.
Many teachers believe that technology is the key to this problem, and, in some ways, it could be. However, within the traditional classroom setting it can only further complicate matters. Students with access to better schools will naturally be better equipped with technology that will effectively supplement their classroom instruction, whereas students in schools with less accessibility will not be able to access electronics of the same caliber. But the main problem, even in higher-ranked schools, is that teachers sometimes lack the training to best use iPads and laptops to their best advantage. This drawback in our educational system does not promise a better future for students hoping to go onto higher education: if students are not proficient with technology at a young age, the problem will only follow them later on in their schooling.
A popular solution to this debacle is the idea of a “flipped” classroom, where students learn on their own at home and then do homework and in-class activities to understand the concept further the next day. Proponents state that by making teachers serve as guides rather than instructors, students can comprehend the material better. This does seem like a more pragmatic approach, especially given the disconnect between the 21st century workplace and the traditional classroom setting. Yet, flipped classrooms could also add to the divide if students do not have access to new material at home because it requires a laptop or computer. Given that only 18 percent of teachers report that their students have adequate Internet access at home, compared to 54 percent at school, this would hinder learning.
Even though technology’s widespread reach is something we hugely benefit from, the price tags attached to many electronic devices often serve as major drawbacks in terms of affordability. High-quality computers may not be affordable for either school districts or families in low-income neighborhoods. Students in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to be entirely smartphone-dependent at home, making it impractical to write essays or lengthy responses for class. Moreover, with 20 percent of low-income students stating they seldom use computers or laptops for homework purposes — and 10 percent only have dial-up access — it is easy to understand how a lack of technology could lead to a greater disparity in education.
According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, equal access to technology does not necessarily lead to an improvement in performance if students cannot use the technology. Future college students will start feeling the struggle particularly in high school, especially due to the fast pace of the 21st century.
There are, in fact, practical fixes to this problem. One such solution is the addition of media labs  — with proper instructor training — in low-income districts. While these students may not have access to computers at home, there is no reason why the schools cannot provide this resource to them. It is in the institution’s best interest to keep students’ performance as high as possible. So, by creating media labs where students have access to high-speed computers and classroom material, students can complete homework, write essays and watch tutorials that they may not have access to at home. With the development of quality media labs, districts are both reforming their educational standards and boosting performance in the students themselves, thus mitigating the digital divide.

In almost any business sector, customers know what they’re paying for. A person who purchases a vehicle has access to its documentation. A person who buys a home has the right to inspect it. However, the same does not hold true when students purchase an education — especially one from USC.
On Tuesday, the Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution aimed at increasing transparency within University spending by expanding and clarifying University financial reports, coupled with a call for the reinstatement of the University Student Fee Advisory Committee and a demand for an immediate tuition freeze.  Not only is this resolution a step in the right direction for the University’s fiscal policy, but it might be the much-needed reversal of a phenomenon destined to ruin the University’s economic diversity and render it unable to compete with more affordable universities.
It is no secret that these changes were a long time coming — USC is one of the few academic institutions of its caliber that has yet to implement something as simple and obviously necessary as a tuition freeze. From Ivy Leagues like Princeton University to the public greats of the UC System, most other universities have taken this step already. Every year that USC seeks to continue to periodically — and inexplicably — raise tuition is another year that it loses a competitive edge not only in attracting applicants, but in retaining top-tier students.
In fact, the struggle to retain students already enrolled is no longer far-fetched. According to USG’s student poll, 76 percent of respondents knew someone who transferred out of USC or considered taking a leave of absence because of rising tuition costs.
Most importantly, an unpredictable price tag makes attendance at USC almost completely out of the question for lower middle-class and working-class families that depend on a predictable, steady number to be able to project whether they will be able to afford University expenses. When qualified and talented students from average or modest financial conditions are burdened with USC’s exorbitant tuition costs — in addition to its silent promise to increase that number — it is no surprise that they would turn to a lower-cost institution of equal caliber, like UC Berkeley or UCLA, both of which have successfully implemented tuition freezes. With these issues on the table, one thing becomes clear: USC’s habit of increasing tuition costs not only places undue burden on its student body, but also has the capacity to impair the University’s ability to remain competitive.
Of course, one could make the argument that these tuition increases would perhaps sting a little less if the student body were to know exactly where their money was going — perhaps if this year’s $2,000 increase had been allocated toward a development of a certain set of academic programs or a resource center, to increase non-tenure track salaries or grant benefits to non-academic employees — maybe then, the lack of tuition freeze could be understood. However, the University’s financial report for this fiscal year was exceedingly unclear: a 72-page PDF report mired in hundreds of projections and graphs but, like a politician’s debate response, no real information — not on where the tuition was going nor who was really on the receiving end of it. To add insult to injury, University spending was at least once discussed with the student body through the University Student Fee Advisory Committee — which the University eventually dissolved, according to Graduate Student Government, on the basis of undesirable responses.
When students lose avenues through which they can interact with the University and become informed about financial figures, awareness about this information is quickly lost. According to the USG poll, 93 percent of respondents did not know where their total tuition dollars went, and as for the increases, 98 percent did not know why their tuition increased $2,000 for the 2015-2016 academic year. To ameliorate this particular problem, USG has asked the University to publish a report or create an interactive website to better illuminate where tuition funds are going. Additionally, 84 percent believed a tuition freeze would alleviate financial burden for students. Even if the University refuses to decrease its heavily expensive tuition fee, it could perhaps agree to make it stagnant.
The fact of the matter is that for a University that charges as much as USC for tuition and peripheral fees, to continue to raise the price is almost laughable. Not only does it place undue burden on the existing student body, but it discriminates against students without privileged financial resources and discourages prospective students from attendance. The lack of transparency as to where these funds are going increases mistrust among the University community and amplifies the sting of the same tuition increases the University fails to explain. Students deserve to be able to predict the cost of their higher education, to access the University regardless of their socioeconomic standing and to rely on their University to responsibly and openly disseminate financial information. For these reasons, USG’s resolution was absolutely necessary — and must have maximum administrative support.

Current SC students, grow thick skin! As a non-white person I never felt, at even the slightest, racism when I attended there. I ain’t no Uncle Tom or some token-minority who hung out with white students. If you look for racism in everything, then you’ll find it. If you look for the worse in things, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ideally, everyone should respect each other, but it doesn’t mean they have to like or accept you.

The theater has and always will be a popular form of entertainment for all. Musicals, in particular, have become one of the most beloved form of theater. The songs from musicals are fun, vibrant and deeply moving. They bring characters to life and steal our hearts. From Wicked to Westside Story, here are 10 choice selections that create the perfect Broadway playlist.
1. “Seasons of Love” – Rent
As one of the most inspiring songs on the list, “Seasons of Love” will forever be a classic. Of course nothing will ever beat the original with Idina Menzel and company, but the legacy of this classic show and its poignant societal criticisms is a great listen at any time.

2. “Defying Gravity” – Wicked
Another moment of Idina Menzel glory is found in this truly beautiful song. A story of triumph, love and breaking down barriers is perfectly summed up in this stunning ballad. As the show with maybe one of the strongest scores of songs, Wicked‘s true gem is “Defying Gravity” — it will make you cry, smile and get goosebumps all at the same time.

3. “Can you feel the love tonight?” – The Lion King
I’m slightly biased, considering the fact that The Lion King is one of my favorites of all time, but this love duet is truly a classic. Dynamic and emotional this song transcends the Disney version when performed live and is a perfect listen for a feel good song.

4. “You Can’t Stop the Beat” – Hairspray
We all remember a lovely dark-haired Zac Efron as Link Larkin in the big-budget Hairspray movie a few years ago, but besides the hunky heartthrob, Hairspray’s real gem is this upbeat dance tune. As a closing number, it’s fun and full of life as it rocks the ’60s beat. If you know the show, you can picture the full-cast performance that becomes the highlight of the whole show. Whether it’s live or on your iPod, this song is perfect to sing (and dance) along to.

5. “On My Own” – Les Miserables
Though this is one of the lesser known Les Mis songs, the original, performed by Lea Salonga, is truly haunting. For anyone experiencing unrequited love, this song will be a truly emotional experience. Heartbreakingly beautiful, this song is great for a rainy day.

6. “America” – West Side Story
Inspired by the saucy Puerto Rican aspect of the story, “America” is an incredibly fun tune. Full of Latin flair and a cha-cha-style melody, this song just makes you want to dance. 

7. “The Music of the Night” – Phantom of the Opera
This might be one of the most epic songs of all time. Orchestrally, it is remarkable, full of brilliant lines and ascending emotional dynamic. No matter if you like the operatic style of the show or not, you have to listen to this song at some point because it truly is a musical masterpiece.

8. “Do-Re-Mi” – The Sound of Music
This song just makes me think of my childhood. A wonderful, upbeat, lively song, it reminds me of all innocence. Its also probably one of the most iconic songs of all the musicals as it has been used in various other platforms. It’s and oldie but a goodie and deserves another listen (or two).

9. “If I Can’t Love Her” – Beauty and the Beast
A song that was left out in the Disney adaptation, this one might be one of the best male solo songs for the stage. A beautiful look into a wounded soul looking for love, this song changes the narrative of the whole story by revealing the Beast’s touchingly human side. A soft and sensitive song, this is one of the tops on this list.

10. “Mama Who Bore Me” – Spring Awakening
This show happens to be one of the darkest yet most interesting I’ve ever seen. It tells the plight of a confused group of teens through folk-infused rock songs. This tune in particular, originally performed by Lea Michele, is haunting and eerie. One listen to it will bring on chills and a whole rollercoaster ride of emotions.

Three cheers · Students celebrate Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center after the Undergraduate Student Government Senate passes the campus climate diversity resolution with an 11-1 vote. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Undergraduate Student Government Senate passed the Campus Climate resolution, postponed two weeks ago and introduced nearly a month ago, at its meeting Tuesday night. The passing vote was nearly unanimous, with Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn voting against, and ended with a resounding “Aye!” from Sen. Alec White.
The Rosen Room in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center was filled with posters placed by enthusiastic students, such as “I FIGHT ON TO SEE CHANGE,” “CHILDREN OF THE RESOLUTION” and “#diSCriminationLivesHere.” The room was also packed to the point that some students had to be moved to another room to watch the procedures livestream.
USG President Rini Sampath, who was an active participant during the evening, said that this victory is by no means conclusive.
“This is just step one of a larger advocacy process,” Sampath said. “We’re making sure that our University is able to implement these diversity initiatives and make our campus climate better.”
Sampath said that the next step will come on Nov. 23, during a scheduled meeting with Provost Michael Quick that she hopes will be “productive” and “beneficial for the student body.”
The intricate process of passing the resolution took place more in the offices of USG than at the actual meeting, during prolonged meetings in which senators and USG directors debated and compromised on each of the amendments.
Right before the vote, Sen. Bulk Lao commented on the effort that went into this initiative.
“We worked really hard,” Lao said. “We went to a meeting at 10 p.m. all the way to midnight on a Sunday, working on this resolution. So people have put a lot of time and effort into this.”
The vote on the resolution was preceded by heated debate.
One discussion focused on the proposed $100 million to be allocated for scholarships and tenured faculty positions for underrepresented communities. Sen. Giuseppe Robalino wanted to change the amendment in an effort to remove this specific sum from the resolution.
“Today, actually, I was at a scholarship luncheon … and I had the opportunity to meet my donor of my scholarship,” Robalino said. “I shared with him the particular provision in this resolution regarding the $100 million. His response was … that the number was not an appropriate number and that it was too high, and this is someone who is donating millions of dollars to USC.”
Sampath responded by mentioning George Lucas, who has recently donated $10 million to the School of Cinematic Arts for diversity-related scholarships.
“There are other donors. If you ask George Lucas, he’s probably going to have another perspective,” Sampath said. “I don’t think that the argument of donors having an issue is really going to strike this down as it stands, because it is pretty evident that we do have donors and trustees that are ready to invest in the diversification and the strengthening of our underrepresented communities at USC.”
Another point of argument was a provision of the resolution that asked for greater enrollment of minority faculty and students. Sen. Chris Fong had an issue with the wording of the amendment, fearing that the word “enrollment” could lead to racial quotas and affirmative action.
“I do agree that we should recruit underrepresented students, and [for] the ones we do have we should make an effort to retain,” Fong said. “But by saying you will ‘enroll, hire and appoint’ based on race, I think that that’s where we have these implications of racial quotas and affirmative action.”
Director of Community Affairs Brianna Thorpe responded, arguing that there are de facto quotas in place and that removing this provision from the resolution would maintain the status quo with few underrepresented minorities in positions of authority.
“After that diversity ‘quota’ is met, then who gets the job?” Thorpe said. “If you are between a black male who has just as [many] qualifications as maybe the white heterosexual male, who is going to get that job? And we know that answer … there aren’t a lot of blacks and Latinos that are in these high positions.”
Other points of contention were the creation of vice deans of diversity in different schools and the increased funding of resource centers. The main argument against these measures from senators and members of the floor was their financing. In every case, those in the majority argued that it could be accomplished given the University’s successful fundraising campaign and the possibility of better allocating resources.
The Senate also unanimously passed the College Affordability, Student Service Assembly and Bicycle Coordinator resolutions.
What an embarrassment for the university and its alumni.
For anyone not entirely clear about this, another article about it online quotes Sophia Li, one of the resolutions co-authors, complaining, “every single one of the books we are reading, is written by an old
white man…there is no single reading in any one of my classes that is
not written by anyone who isn’t like old, white or man.”
Doesn’t it seem odd, too, that a student senate would call for greater enrollment of minority students in a university that lists only 34% of its students as “white?”
Bigotry is still bigotry, no matter how much framing is used to make it look pretty.

Festival of lights · Students listen to Bharathwaj Nandakumar lead the Pooja, a prayer, at a celebration of Diwali hosted by the Hindu Student Organization and Southern California Indo-Americans. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The Hindu Student Organization and Southern California Indo-Americans hosted a celebration of Diwali on Tuesday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom.
Within 10 minutes of the doors opening at 6:40 p.m., nearly half of the tables were filled with students, faculty and staff.
Diwali, which means “festival of lights,” is a Hindu festival that celebrates the triumph of good over evil. The festival, celebrated in autumn, is one of the largest in India. Many people arrived in regular clothing; however, some arrived in traditional Indian garb.
The program began with welcoming addresses by Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life, and Rev. Jim Burklo, associate dean of Religious Life.
After the speeches, everyone took off their shoes and gathered around the altar as Bharathwaj Nandakumar led the Pooja, or prayer.
Eena Singh, an academic advisor for the Marshall School of Business, then offered a reflection of what Diwali meant to her.
“Diwali is more than just the festival of lights,” she said. “It signifies the will to have peace in the world, to strive for freedom and to maintain strength in your character because you have to believe that good will triumph over evil.”
Performances then began as volunteers from SCIA and HSO ushered the guests to candle-lit tables to enjoy traditional Indian food. From Indian dance routines to music, performers demonstrated their talent and celebrated their culture.
Students clapped their hands and sang along as the Alaap Group, composed of Yogesh Bhosale and Apoorva Mahabaleshwara, graduate students studying computer science, performed a medley of a traditional and Bollywood song.
“We are really fortunate that we can represent Indian music here,” said Bhosale, a keyboardist. “It was my dream to perform music in the United States and USC.”
Freshman Joel Sigal, an aerospace engineering student, attended the event with freshman business administration major Siri Balusu.
Sigal said he especially enjoyed the second-to-last performance, covers of Bollywood songs.
“They were very engaging with the audience,” Sigal said.
The night ended in a performance by DJ Bhagyashree Pujar.
According to Sowmy Krishnakumar, a graduate student studying computer science and a HSO member, the organization started planning their Diwali celebration a month ago, and formed their partnership with SCIA around December of last year.
“It is our biggest event of the year so we had to plan a lot in advance,” he said.
Krishnakumar said that Soni encouraged HSO to collaborate with SCIA for the event.
“We thought, ‘Why make two separate Diwali celebrations when we could make a big Diwali event which could probably reach more people?’” he said.
Through Diwali celebrations are an annual affair for Balusu, she said she really enjoyed the festivities.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve been completely immersed in Indian culture,” she said. “It was nice to retrace my roots and re-experience what really is a big part of my life through not just the food, but the performances and the overall vibe as well.”
Though Diwali is observed mainly by Hindus, Chaitanya Amin, a graduate student studying electrical engineering and HSO’s director of public relations, believes the celebration applies to a universal audience.
“Everyone always stands for good,” he said. “Everyone already stands for knowledge. Everyone stands for light. It is always appropriate, no matter what your beliefs are, because Diwali stands for good.”
Burklo echoed that sentiment during his speech.
“As I look out in the room now, I see a lot of light,” he said. “And so, tonight, celebrate this light which the divine has put in each of our souls, the light that shines out of our actions of compassion and kindness, interfaith harmony and understanding.”
This article previously identified Bharathwaj Nandakumar as Bhaidway Nandakumar. The article also stated that the event ended with SCIA’s “Bollywood Jukebox.” The event ended with a performance by DJ Bhagyashree Pujar. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

On Nov. 20 the gourmet hot dog and sausage restaurant chain Dog Haus will open its 12th location at University Park. Earlier in the semester, Dog Haus began selling three signature hot dogs specifically for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Those mourning the loss of Freebirds on Figueroa will find a replacement in the craft casual hot dog concept of this Pasadena-based chain, which will operate at 3335 S. Figueroa St. every day from 7 a.m. to midnight.
On Figueroa, Dog Haus will serve hot dogs, burgers, chili cheese tots and milkshakes, along with several of their own creations. These include the Downtown Dog — a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with caramelized onions, bell peppers and other toppings, and The Fonz, spicy Italian sausage with pastrami and melted mozzarella.
According to a recent press release, the location also hopes to provide diners with a wine and beer menu by the end of the year.
The USC location will be the first to offer breakfast options. These will be served daily as well, from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., and will feature a Build Your Own Breakfast Burrito menu.
Dog Haus describes its brand as “fast casual” and aims to give diners a throwback to backyard hot dog and burger barbecues with a modern aesthetic.
Recently, the company has undergone expansion. The first of two locations in Pasadena opened in 2010, and the chain has grown to 10 franchise stores since, the 10th being at USC.
The franchisee, Tenny Megerdichian, is an original founder’s sister. She said she has liked watching the hot dog chain’s growth.
“It has been incredible to see this brand grow over the past years, and I am so proud of what my brother and his business partners have accomplished in just five years,” Megerdichian said in a press release. “I’m honored to officially become part of the Dog Haus family with this opening and can’t wait to bring the absolute würst to the USC community!”
From 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Nov. 20, the new location will offer customers a free Haus Dog from their menu of seven signature hot dogs.

Off the books · Laurence Michalak, an expert on North Africa, spoke about Tunisia’s black market in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Tuesday. – Kenneth Rodriguez-Clisham | Daily Trojan
The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences hosted renowned cultural anthropologist and Middle East-North Africa expert Laurence Michalak Tuesday afternoon for a presentation on the role of the black market in Tunisian society.
The talk, “Merchants at the Margins: The Politics of Informal Commerce in Tunisia,” was presented by the Middle East Studies Program.
Michalak, who served as the vice chair at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley for 23 years, explained that a black market or “informal economy” is one where people don’t pay taxes and don’t declare their income — or, in other words, are not “on the books.” In defining the informal economy, however, Michalak stressed that though it is essentially an illegal practice, there are degrees of illegality.
“There are really bad parts of the informal economy, like smuggling drugs and arms,” Michalak said. “But on the other hand, there are things that are illegal but tolerated, such as vendors selling gasoline on the side of the road.”
Michalak’s research has focused on the way that the informal economy affects Tunisian society, and how this has changed since the Arab Spring. According to the World Bank, 53 percent of Tunisia’s employment and 38.4 percent of its GNP are in the informal sector, numbers that only increased after the 2011 Tunisian revolution.
“After the revolution, more people went to the informal sector because they needed a job and couldn’t feed their families,” Michalak said. “So they made themselves a job.”
Michalek said much of the motivation for entering the informal sector also arises out of a refusal to pay taxes that people believe will only go to support a corrupt government. According to Michalak, the informal economy is also tied to politics in Tunisia.
“Mohamed Bouazizi was selling fruits and vegetables illegally on the street, and the police confiscated his goods,” Michalak said. “So he set himself on fire, and that was the start of the Arab Spring — it all started in informal commerce.”
According to Michalak, people working in the informal sector have found creative and often surprising ways to make a living. Michalak described Tunisian women who would fly to Turkey and purchase clothing in bulk, then return to Tunisia to sell it “out of their living rooms.” He showed pictures of walls painted brightly with cartoon characters and explained that these were informal kindergartens, which are widespread throughout Tunisia, are not taxed, and are not sanctioned by the government.
“It’s a lot like the United States,” Michalak said. “Every country has a sector of its economy that’s informal.”
Michalak’s interest in studying informal economies arose out of his personal experience in Tunisia, and his desire to understand what drove so many people to pursue illegal channels of work and business.
“When I lived in Tunisia, I was right next to the street with the most vendors,” Michalak said. “I used to walk past these people every day. I used to stop and chat with them, and sometimes I would buy things from them. So it was a natural extension to study them.”
After Michalak’s presentation, Rym Kaki of the Sol Price School of Public Policy provided commentary on the future of the informal economy and the practical applications of Michalak’s research. Kaki acknowledged that an informal economy presents many problems, including exploitation of labor and a lack of safety regulations. However, she also stressed that though many current policies are aimed at developing ways to move people out of informal commerce, the “formal” economy brings its own share of problems, such as when governments fail to provide their people with services and protections. According to Kaki, more research needs to be done to develop solutions to poverty in Tunisia and the Middle East as a whole.
“Research provides us with the raw data, but we need to move beyond data and start an agenda for action,” Kaki said. “One person alone can’t make those changes — we want to work together on practical solutions.”
