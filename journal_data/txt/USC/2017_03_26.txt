Jessica Idenoshita, a freshman majoring in international relations and East Asian language and cultures, knows the effects of cancer firsthand. As a cancer survivor herself, she knows how the disease can impact patients as well as an entire community, and she decided to give back through USC Colleges Against Cancer.
“Everyone has been affected by cancer, whether it be your family, your friends or people that they know that have been affected by cancer,” Idenoshita said. “For me personally, I have been really impacted by cancer as a patient as well as survivor, so I want to give back to the community now [by] just being involved in this club and this event, fundraising for cancer research, meeting other people that share the same interests and raising money for a good cause.”
USC CAC teamed up with the American Cancer Society to host USC Relay for Life, which took place from Saturday morning to Sunday morning. The event was created to raise money for cancer research, as well as honor cancer patients and their caregivers.

“It’s a 24-hour fundraiser, and the main idea is to raise money for ACS,” said Brendon Wei, a senior majoring in biological sciences and the production chair of USC CAC. “People sign up for teams, and they fundraise individually or as teams. It’s kind of like a competition — we usually have prizes going out to the top three fundraisers or top three teams.”
The ACS uses donations to advance cancer research, spread education and awareness about cancer and provide emotional support and services to families that care for cancer patients. Events like Relay for Life take place on college campuses and in residential neighborhoods, aiming to involve the community.
“It brings together the school and also the community,” Idenoshita said. “Not just students were here today, but also local community members, families and people from high schools and elementary schools.”
Students involved in the club get the opportunity to plan the event on committees and conduct various tasks over the 24 hours to keep the event going smoothly.
“In general, I think it’s a great opportunity as university students — we’re still not fully professional, but we’re able to impact our community by doing events like this,” said Brendon Chou, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “By serving as volunteers, we are able to show our interests and invest time into things that we are passionate about, and something like cancer research and taking care of families and people in general for their  welfare and the welfare of society.”
Wei felt the need to get involved after watching his father’s struggle with lymphoma when Wei was in his sophomore year of high school. According to Wei, his father, who has been in remission since he started college, has been his main motivation for joining Colleges Against Cancer.
“I didn’t see my dad a lot or my mom because she was taking care of him for that year,” Wei said. “Other people [in the club] have had cancer or have family members who have cancer. Unfortunately, some of them have lost family members to cancer.”
Chou believes that USC, as one of the most recognized universities in the world, is in a unique situation to make an impact.
“USC definitely encourages involvement in these areas where people are really affected in terms of health care, in terms of spirit of community,” Chou said. “I believe that USC is just trying to show that us as students, us as faculty and us as friends and family… all care and have a role in bettering society and people in general.”

When Charlene Flores’ six- year-old daughter told her that she met someone famous during summer camp, Flores was thrilled to hear that the “celebrity” was a female scientist.
“It just makes my heart sing,” Flores said in a video for Project Scientist, the camp her daughter attended.
This summer, USC is hosting Project Scientist, a STEM program for young girls founded by USC alumna Sandy Marshall. In the past, Project Scientist has worked with universities such as CalTech to create a rigorous scientific curriculum for the camp. USC has now teamed up with Project Scientist to help develop the curriculum for each session.
The camp is broken up into six one-week segments that each cover a different topic. Themes for each section range from space exploration to civil engineering, with activities designed to focus on the topic in fun and interactive ways.
“I started Project Scientist for my daughters and girls all over the country with an aptitude, talent and passion for science, technology, engineering and math,” Marshall said in a Project For Science video. “I couldn’t find any science programs that were just for girls and serving girls as young as four years old, even though the research out there says you need to catch kids at this young age — four, five and six — when they already have a natural interest in science.”
Each day includes hands-on activities that approach the theme through the lenses of art and exercise, as well as more traditional scientific learning and field trips that relate to the week’s topic. At the start of the day, campers have the opportunity to speak with a professional, a “STEM superstar,” to learn about their experience in their field and ask questions.
“I think it’s extremely important that girls see role models that look like me and other women because I want them to not be intimidated about a field that may be male-dominated, for example,” said Moogega Stricker, a “STEM superstar” and NASA Jet Propulsion Lab engineer, in the same video. “I want them to change our future.”
One of the main focuses of the camp is to encourage girls to see themselves in a STEM-related field. Activities aimed at self-reflection challenge what campers have been taught about what a scientist is and hope to give campers the confidence they need to be successful.
“On day one, girls do the ‘draw a scientist’ test, and girls will typically draw an Einstein-type figure in the lab,” Marshall said. “By day five, girls are starting to draw females, and they’re drawing those less traditional pictures of a scientist out in the field doing things beyond the lab. By their final day with us, girls are drawing themselves and stating what they want to do in STEM.”

On a Friday afternoon, Jessica Nathania, a senior majoring in human biology, can be found at California Hospital Medical Center.
“The best thing about Remedy is when, after a performance, a patient or hospital member will come up and let us know how much they really appreciated it,” Nathania said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “This happens more often than I thought it would, too.”
Nathania is the co-president of Remedy Through Music, a USC student-run group committed to performing therapeutic music for patients in medically underserved areas of Los Angeles.
“Remedy Through Music is a service organization aimed to help mitigate the pain and suffering of patients in hospitals, residents in assisted living homes and at-risk children through the use of music,” Remedy Through Music Vice President Shamit Bhatia said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Remedy strives to empower USC students to use their musical talents and help out the local community around USC by providing [therapy] to all. Music has no specific language and is therefore universal.”
The organization usually has one performance a week, often on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning with an occasional performance on Sunday. These performances generally take place at medical care centers, convalescent homes or after school centers for children. Students are also encouraged to play for patients in a more intimate setting, such as their individual rooms.
In addition to weekly performances, the group organizes a more formal recital on a semester basis at Kingsley Manor where students are given the opportunity to perform more polished pieces.
Members perform any genre of music, ranging from Bach to the Beatles.
Most students in Remedy Through Music enjoy using music as a means to express themselves while also appreciating medicine and its positive influence on society. Many students who take part in the organization are majoring in science-related fields or are pursuing the pre-health track at USC.
Co-President Brian Zukotynski said he initially joined his freshman year to combine his two passions: music and medicine.
“Beyond weekly performance opportunities, Remedy provides me the chance to use the musical skills I have built up over most of my life to give back to my community and fellow students,” Zukotynkski said. “Remedy’s goal is to bring the joy of music to anyone who wants to listen, but primarily for the sick  and elderly.”

Long-time women’s tennis head coach Richard Gallien announced Friday that he would step down at the end of the 2017 season after leading the Trojans for 22 years.
“It has been a privilege to have coached so many brilliant young women in my 22 fantastic years at this remarkable university,” Gallien said. “All but two student-athletes who played for me received their degrees, something of which I am very proud.”
Gallien compiled an impressive resume over the course of his Trojan tenure, guiding the program to 20 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and earning five Pac-12 Coach of the Year awards. Gallien has led the Trojans to three national semifinals and seven quarterfinals, most recently falling to eventual NCAA champions Vanderbilt in the 2015 semifinals.
USC also won four conference titles on Gallien’s watch, finishing in the national top 10 on 11 occasions to date. Four individual players won Pac-12 Player of the Year under him, and three doubles teams were named conference Doubles Team of the Year — including the duo of Sabrina Santamaria and Kaitlyn Christian, who won the NCAA doubles championship in 2013.

“I look forward to coaching our team through the postseason and finishing strong,” Gallien said. “And in the future, I will always be rooting for all the teams at USC.”
Since his arrival from Pepperdine in 1996, Gallien has compiled a 367-144 record at USC, though that record does not include seven vacated wins (and one win turned into a loss) from the 2010 NCAA sanctions levied against USC’s football, men’s basketball and women’s tennis programs for “lack of institutional control and extra benefits.” The tennis team’s penalty was self-imposed after former women’s tennis player Gabriela Niculescu made 123 unauthorized international calls to family members using an athletic department long-distance access code for a total cost of $7,000.
This season, the Trojans are 5-7, having snapped a four-match losing run on Wednesday with a home victory over Loyola Marymount. Gallien’s final match at Marks Stadium will come against his alma mater Pepperdine on April 19. He will then coach his final regular season contest against crosstown rival UCLA in Westwood three days later before preparing for the postseason.
What post season are you talking about with a 5 – 7 record? He served USC well for most of the years. Never won a
national title or reached the championship match. He had the #1 player in the country a couple of times not taking
advantage of her. Trouble with one foreign student – athlete charging international telephone calls to the university.
Compare his accomplishments to the Men Tennis Coach Peter Smith. Time has come for a new regime with AD Swann
making the right move now.

The top-ranked USC women’s water polo team ended March on a tear, pouring on the goals to take down visiting No. 14 San Jose State 19-3 and No. 18 Hartwick 21-5 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Saturday to remain perfect on the season and extend their national women’s record winning streak to 51 matches in a row.
USC (24-0, 2-0 MPSF) was led by senior 2-meter Brigitta Games, who had a career scoring day in the pool. The All-American recorded a whopping 11 goals in just two games, highlighted by a career-high seven-goal outburst against San Jose State in the first match and a four-goal outing against Hartwick in the second. The Trojans also played some lockdown defense to hold both opponents scoreless in the second half of each game, as all three USC goalies saw time in the cage and allowed a combined total of just eight goals. All in all, USC outscored its opponents by a 40-8 margin.
In the conference match against San Jose State, Games was nearly unstoppable from 2-meters, scoring four goals in a row early while recording a career-high five goals by halftime to give USC the 10-3 advantage. Two more strikes by Games would get past the Spartan goalie in the second half, while USC’s own netminders put the clamps down on the Spartan offense and held them scoreless the rest of the way. Junior Victória Chamorro, who made the start in goal, finished with four saves, while freshman Holly Parker came in relief in the fourth period and recorded two stops to help USC secure the 19-3 win.
In addition to Games’ seven goals, senior driver Stephania Haralabidis punched in four goals while freshman driver Denise Mammolito, freshman utility Maud Megens and senior driver Ioanna Haralabidis each scored twice. Junior utility Hayley McKelvey and sophomore driver Courtney Fahey added one goal apiece as the Trojans outshot San Jose State, 33-18. With the win, USC ended the Spartans’ two-match winning streak and reached 50 games in their own win streak.
Once that match was over, USC faced off against No. 18 Hartwick in a nonconference bout. The Hawks kept it close in the first period by trading early scores, but USC pushed ahead to lead 6-3 at the end of the frame. On a man-up advantage early in the second period, Stephania Haralabidis scored the Trojans’ 10th goal, one that would move her up to No. 2 all-time in career scoring at USC.
One final strike with 10 seconds left before the half by junior driver Brianna Daboub allowed the Trojans to carve out a 14-5 advantage and they never looked back, scoring seven more goals and holding Hartwick scoreless to finish with the 21-5 victory. Games tallied four goals, while Stephania Haralabidis and Megens scored three each. The swarming USC defense was also too much for the Hawks to handle, as McKelvey recorded a game-high five steals and sophomore goalkeeper Amanda Longan notched 10 saves in just three periods.
While the Spartans and the Hawks don’t pose quite the same threat as the likes of Stanford and UCLA do, Trojan head coach Jovan Vavic has instilled a high level of discipline and accountability that his players, like Ioanna Haralabidis, have responded well to.
“We have the benefit of a coach like Jovan, who always keeps us on edge,” Haralabidis said. “He pushes us hard every single day in practice and in games and tells us that even though they might not be the best team out there this season, we still have to respect them and perform well in order to win. We like when he pushes us like that because in the end, it makes us stronger players.”
USC will now get to stay in its home waters for the back end of a five-game home stand as they host No. 6 Arizona State in an MPSF conference match on Saturday. The battle with the Sun Devils will begin at 12:30 p.m. at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center and will be broadcast live on Pac-12 Network.

After four days of competition, the men’s swim and dive team came away with a sixth place finish at the NCAA championships. Record-breaking times and standout performances from new swimmers headlined the event as the Trojans returned to a top 10 finishing spot.
The week started with a bang for the Trojans after junior Dylan Carter led his 800y freestyle relay to a school-best time on Wednesday. Carter’s individual leg of the race clocked in at 1:30.95 minutes, finishing as the third-fastest 200y time in NCAA history.
Sophomore Patrick Mulcare, junior Santo Condorelli and senior Reed Malone kept pace to notch a 6:10.97 minute time, blanking the former school record of 6:11.64 minutes. The former record took first in the NCAA championships in 2015 and the new record earned the team a fifth place to start the championships.
The Trojans finished the day in seventh place behind Carter’s relay. The team trailed behind Stanford’s 105 points with a 75-point finish to the day after suffering a disqualification in the preliminaries of the 200y freestyle relay.
Carter also finished seventh in the 50y freestyle with a time of 19.08 seconds, just a fingertip behind the personal record time of 19.04 seconds that he notched in the preliminaries. Although that time didn’t count in the finals, it moved Carter to the place of the second-fastest Trojan to swim the event.
Also on Thursday, junior Ralf Tribuntsov and Condorelli tied for 19th place in the 50y freestyle preliminaries with a time of 19.35 seconds. The time was a personal record finish for Tribuntsov.
The three sprinters then teamed up with sophomore Carsten Vissering to take home fourth in the 400y relay, notching new school time of 3:02.20 seconds to completely erase the previous record by 2.31 seconds. Tribuntsov spearheaded the relay by breaking his previous record set in 2015 with a spring of 44.76 seconds. Condorelli closed with a 41.40-second sprint to bring the Trojans the top-five finish. The performance was necessary for a team struggling to recover from the previous disqualification.
“We could have rolled over and pouted about the relay [disqualification] this morning to start the session, but the guys stepped up, put it behind them and had a good morning session,” head coach Dave Salo said. “They then came back with outstanding results in the 50 free and 400 medley relay.”
Thursday also provided solid finishes for Trojans in the B finals. Sophomore Patrick Mulcare broke the school’s record in the 200y IM with a personal record finish of 1:44 minutes. Later, freshman diver Henry Fusaro took 12th on the 1-meter with a score of 334.20.
On Friday, the Trojans battled to overcome their previous disqualification to climb upwards in the ranking. The team finished the day remaining in seventh with 142.5 points, clawing closer to Stanford.
Carter tied for second in the 200y freestyle with a finish of 1:31.16 seconds, finishing only 0.52 seconds behind Townley Haas, who holds the American record in the event. His time came just shy of the record-breaking performance that he posted on Wednesday.
In the 100y breaststroke, Vissering broke his former school record with a 51.40 second finish, becoming the first Trojan All-American in the event since 2013. The time put him in third place in the event to qualify for the final.
Tribuntsov also qualified for a final, becoming the first Trojan to make it to the last round of the 100y backstroke three straight times since the 1970s. He finished in fifth with a time of 45.13 seconds.
Junior diver Dashiell Enos also earned his first NCAA points on Friday, finishing in 11th on the 3-meter event with a final score of 425.85 points. Freshman Henry Fusaro finished behind him in 14th with a finish of 374.90 points.
On Saturday night, the Trojans made a huge final surge to move up into sixth place with 237 points. It was the team’s third top-six finish in the past five years, and left the team wondering what might have happened if the 200y freestyle relay had not been disqualified.
Mulcare started the night with the fifth-fastest 200y backstroke finish in the NCAA, coming in third place with a time of 1:37.80 minutes. It was the fourth time that Mulcare broke the school record in this race in the last month alone.
In the fastest NCAA 100y freestyle event of all time, Carter and Condorelli finished within 0.01 seconds of each other to take fourth and fifth in the event. Carter finished in 41.76 seconds and Condorelli finished in 41.77. The event was won by Florida’s Caleb Dressel, who claimed the race in an American record-breaking time of 40 seconds. Carter and Condorelli are now the second and third fastest Trojans ever in 100y freestyle.
The championships were a standout weekend for Carter, who finished as a six-time All-American despite having never qualified for an NCAA A final before. It was a result that left both the team and the coaches proud.
“The guys just kept feeding off of each other’s performances and turned in one of our best efforts ever,” Salo said. “I can’t describe how proud we are of this team. We fought back every swim, every session, to crawl back into the rankings. I think overall we had one of the best meets from top to bottom.”
The Trojans finished the night off with a third place finish in the 400y freestyle relay as Condorelli, Tribuntsov, Carter and Malone notched a time of 2:47.33 seconds, barely 0.27 seconds off the previous school record. The race was the last performance in the pool for Malone, the team’s three-time co-captain who capped off his career as a seven-time All-American.
“Our performance this weekend was the manifestation of the camaraderie this team has shared for the entire season,” Malone said. “Through adversity, our confidence in each other never wavered, and it paid off with great individual performances and an even better team performance. Our goal is always to try to make our teammates back home and alumni proud, and [I] hope we did that this weekend.”

USC entered this weekend’s home stand against Arizona State after winning its first conference series of the season last week over Washington State. The Trojans defended their home field to win two out of three games.
In the first game of the series, the Trojans edged the Sun Devils 5-4 in the team’s fourth extra-inning game of the season. The 11-inning thriller came to a conclusion when freshman outfielder Matthew Acosta scored on a fielding error. Fellow freshman outfielder Brady Shockey came up big in his best career game to date, recording two hits along with a key RBI in the sixth inning.
Saturday’s game was a much different sight. ASU rocked the Trojans’ pitching staff for 12 hits and seven runs. Junior starting pitcher Brad Wegman had a tough outing, giving up seven hits, but he received little support from the batting order as Sun Devil pitchers Chaz Montoya and Eder Erves held USC to just four hits combined.
After trading wins, the two teams were set for a series-deciding tilt on Sunday afternoon. In front of a packed crowd full of little leaguers, USC’s bats came back to life in a 7-4 win.
The Sun Devils got out to an early advantage in the first inning as Lyle Lin, the first Taiwanese-born player to be selected in the MLB Draft, reached home on an error at third base from junior Adalberto Carrillo. However, the lead would not last long as senior David Edson reached home from third on a wild pitch to tie the game at 1-1.
Another error helped the Trojans gain their first lead of the game, as freshman second baseman Tyler Pritchard scored on a passed ball in the third. Sun Devil right fielder Gage Ganning responded by launching a double to center field that sent a runner home, tying the game in the fourth inning.
The bottom of the fourth turned out to be the game-changing frame for USC. With one out and the bases loaded, sophomore Lars Nootbaar stepped up to the plate. Up to that point, he had seen very few hittable pitches, but on this occasion, ASU pitcher Reagan Todd had no choice but to throw right down the middle. A small group of young fans chanted “Grand Slam” as Nootbaar stood in the box. They would have to settle for a two-run single that turned into three after a throwing error in the field. Nootbaar continues to be the Trojans’ clutch performer this year, leading the team with 21 RBIs.
With USC leading 6-2, the Sun Devils gained back some ground with a Lin RBI single in the fifth. In the bottom of the seventh inning, senior outfielder Corey Dempster struck a double off the right-field wall that sent freshman outfielder Christian Moya home for the team’s seventh run. Dempster continued his hot start to the season, as his hitting streak extended to 10 games.
With a 7-3 lead in the ninth inning, head coach Dan Hubbs sent freshman lefty Austin Manning to the mound to close out the game. Manning got off to a dicey start, giving up a double, a single and then a run on a fielder’s choice. Hubbs walked onto the field to have a quick conversation with the young closer, who shook off the rough start of the inning to retire the next two batters and preserve the victory.
After winning their second straight Pac-12 series, the Trojans stand at 14-8 and 4-2 in the conference. Next they play Arizona in a road series starting on Tuesday.

For decades, thousands of South and Central Americans have lost their lives chasing the American Dream by illegally boarding a freight train dubbed La Bestia —  or “the beast” in English, according to the USC Fisher Museum of Art website.
Featuring the works of 41 visual artists accompanied by 52 poets, the MONTARlaBestia exhibit at the USC Fisher Museum of Art encapsulates the profound hope and hardship that characterizes the journey from Mexico to the U.S. border.
The display was conceptualized by curator Marco Barrera Bassols, artist Demian Flores and social activist Mardonio Carballo to facilitate discourse about the obstacles of migration, from the difficulty of the journey itself to the depth of discrimination that awaits in a new land.
The Fisher Museum is the exhibit’s first stop in the United States after its appearance in Mexico at the San Agustin Arts Center in Etla, Oaxaca and the Mexican Railroad Museum in Puebla. Fisher served as a fitting host for the exhibit’s first American showing because of the museum’s long-standing support of Mexican and Latin American artists as well as Fisher Museum Director Selma Holo’s engagement with Mexican art and prior relationship with the curators and artists involved.
Each of the artists, all members of the Collective of Artists Against Discrimination, was provided with a 90 by 20-centimeter frame on which to capture the experience of La Bestia.
The finished products are mounted side-by-side in a manner reminiscent to linked train cars. Rather than attributing works to artists, each piece is accompanied by a plaque inscribed with lines from poems dealing with migration in Spanish and Nahuatl, an Aztec language.
Some works capture themes of death and decay, such as artist Jorge Wolff’s multimedia piece with bloodied skulls rising off the canvas paired with writer Dominique Legrand’s words, which are translated into: “The Beast is dead already / No one can ride it anymore / It is a ghost / With a hundred skulls above.” Others express more hopeful sentiments, such as artist Saul Kaminer’s vividly colored, abstract painting complemented by multidisciplinary artist Patricio Hidalgo’s words, translated as: “The moon migrates / and so does the sun. / Life migrates / and so does love.”
The centerpiece of the exhibit is a diorama by artist Gabriel Macotela of a model train chugging in circles around a small, steel city — a metaphor for the determination of migrants in spite of the unattainability of the industrial utopia that is America.
“The metaphor of the train is meant to underline the deep humanity of the immigrants who come to the United States,” Holo said. “The risks they take to help their families and to have a better life are enormous. They take the train and risk mutilation, rape and robbery by those who have no respect for human life. The train is both a means to achieve the American Dream and a metaphor of the courage it sometimes takes to achieve that dream.”
Also emblazoned across the walls of the exhibit are statistics about the Latin American diaspora.
The exhibit opened on March 19 with a reception where representatives from the USC Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California hosted a discussion and Consul General of Mexico in Los Angeles Carlos García de Alba and USC Provost Michael Quick gave remarks. It will remain at the museum until April 8.
Given the nature of modern-day political discourse, Holo believes that the humanizing message delivered through art and poetry about the migrant experience is more significant than ever.
“I hope, given the current political landscape that people leave the exhibition feeling the humanity of those who struggle to get here,” Holo said. “I hope that the exhibition creates empathy.”

About 78,000 EDM fans flocked to San Bernardino this weekend to attend Beyond Wonderland: The Endless Sea, an electronic music festival that has gained immense popularity similar to that of Electric Daisy Carnival, Countdown and Nocturnal Wonderland. Hosted by Insomniac Events, the two-day festival returned to its original home at the NOS Events Center. It also featured a variety of DJs and subgenres, ranging from deep and tropical house to dubstep and hardstyle.
Throughout the venue, eclectic art installations, colorful lights and whimsical set-ups brought the festival to life. A variety of decorations such as starfish lanterns, seahorse statues and a 20-feet wide steel squid structure were sprawled throughout the venue and the lagoon at the front entrance.  During both days, ravers enjoyed their time at Beyond Wonderland, exchanging kandi bracelets, carrying flags and decorated totems and dancing the night away even outside of the six stages scattered across the venue.

The energy during both days was electric — every stage was filled with eager fans, ready to dance and headbang to some of the top DJs in the electronic music industry. To start off day one, DJs such as Martin Solveig, Audien and Eptic B2B Must Die! performed in the early evening. Undoubtedly, the most popular stages of the night were Queen’s Domain and Outer Realm. Several DJs performed inside The Aquarium, a stage specializing in house music.
Later in the evening, Ekali and Illenium took on Outer Realm, playing remixes of popular songs such as “Work,” “Zoo” and “Shelter,” and of music from other DJs such as TroyBoi. Headbanging was a popular form of dance during these two sets, while mosh pits developed in various cyphers throughout the crowd. Hardwell and GTA’s performance overfilled the Queen’s Domain, leading to huge crowds flowing out of the tent.
Meanwhile, up and coming DJs such as JSTJR, Aazar and Gladiator drew wandering ravers to a relatively small stage called Upside-Down House, a unique set-up resembling an old, whimsical house with neon UV lights reflected on the structure. Sander van Doorn, Alison Wonderland, Shiba San, Astrix and Dillon Nathaniel ended the night with electrifying performances.
While Alison Wonderland, one of the top female DJs in the world, attracted the most fans with her trip hop and trap style, Sander van Doorn was unable to draw in a crowd, barely filling up half of the Queen’s Domain, the main stage of the event.
On day two, the number of attendees doubled as foot traffic increased and traffic lanes surrounding the venue shut down. The second and final day showed a promising line-up of performers, such Party Favor, Herobust, Tommy Trash, NGHTMRE, Yellow Claw, Bro Safari, Paul van Dyk, Snails and Diplo.
Though the lines and stages throughout the venue were overflowing, attendees still found a way to have a good time. Arguably, the most popular performances came from NGHTMRE, Snails, Herobust, Yellow Claw and Diplo. Ravers kept the energy of the festival up, dancing to all different styles of electronic music from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. nonstop, as performers quickly transitioned in between every set and started at the right time.
NGHTMRE, Snails, Herobust and Yellow Claw energized crowds with their songs and remixes of songs from dubstep and hardstyle artists such as Skrillex. Attendees enjoyed themselves by dancing hard whenever the bass dropped.
Though Beyond Wonderland was a unique experience for many, there were several recurrences that left some attendees disappointed. DJs throughout day two continued the same trends, overplaying remixes and renditions of Benny Benassi’s “Cinema” and Skrillex’s “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.”
In addition, at almost every performance, ravers heard the same phrases being repeated. The first line was “Stop acting like a b-tch, get your hands up!” from Zomboy’s “Like a B-tch”; the second was “If you ain’t takin’ shots get the f-ck out the club” from LMFAO’s “Shots.” In an attempt to pump up crowds, the DJs repeated and used the same lines, hoping that ravers would follow suit and continue dancing. These patterns among performers throughout the night lacked the originality and distinctive styles that many attendees were looking for when anticipating their favorite DJs’ performances.
During both nights, Insomniac Events tried to hype up the festival’s theme “The Endless Sea” by having dancers and stunters carry large props, such as neon jellyfish and a giant octopus, in several performances. Though these props were visually appealing, attendees in the back did not enjoy being pushed and having their view of the stage obstructed.
Despite the repetitive musical style and heavy traffic flow that occurred on day two, Beyond Wonderland added to Insomniac Events’ credibility as a powerhouse for EDM festivals. Ravers thoroughly enjoyed their experience with every performance, as visuals and colorful lighting amplified the music at all stages. This year’s Beyond Wonderland continued to bring in new audiences and allowed them to experience the unique facets of rave culture and “PLUR.”

The Thursday before spring break, I received a call that changed my life. I woke up to the sound of the phone ringing, mindlessly picking up without looking to see who the caller was.
“Is something wrong with your sexuality?” the caller asked in a somber voice. “I read what you wrote, and I’m very disappointed in you.”
Immediately afterward, he hung up. The voice I heard was my dad’s.
Half an hour later, I walked into work with red, swollen eyes. I spent the entire morning crying, shocked and confused about what had happened. I was overwhelmed — and hurt — about what my dad had said after finding out about my bisexuality. For most of the day, there was a recurring thought that I couldn’t erase from my mind — that I had disappointed my family.
I grew numb to those feelings as the day went on. I tried staying preoccupied with work and other assignments, so I could ignore all the text messages that my brother, my mom and my dad sent. Seven phone calls went unanswered, but by the end of the day, I finally mustered up the courage to respond. As my brother told me, I had to “rip the Band-Aid off as soon as possible.” At 9:30 p.m., I called my parents back. For half an hour, it felt like the world had stopped moving, that I had failed the people I loved most. Every word spoken felt like a needle piercing through my skin.
While my mom was generally accepting, my dad was the one who was in denial. I couldn’t respond to what he told me.
“I hope you know that what you are isn’t what you actually are sometimes,” he said. “You have a choice, and Mom and I will support you no matter what. But if you go down the wrong path, you are choosing to live a very difficult and lonely life.”
He proceeded to ask me to end any same-sex relationship I was currently in and try exploring heterosexuality for six months. It was as if he thought I had a choice.
As with many other traditional Asian American families, my family believes that people can either be gay or straight by choice and there is nothing in between those two binaries. After struggling to deal with my brother’s sexuality for several years, my parents recently became more supportive of him and his relationships. However, that meant I had to face the immense pressure of being the “normal” son, the one who wouldn’t disappoint.
For years, I internalized everything I wish I could have told my parents. I was aware of the devastation and pain they’d face if they knew about my personal life. So I masked every suspicion, concealed my identity and hid all my secrets from them. I was certain that I could hide from them for as long as possible. They didn’t have to know, and they’d never have to know.
I spent my spring break alone in Chicago reflecting on everything that had happened. And strangely, the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders — my parents would have found out sooner or later. However, I thought about the conversation I had with my dad that Thursday night with anger and resentment.
How could he tell me I was making the wrong lifestyle choice? And how could he predict that I’d live an unhappy and difficult life in the future? I was confounded by all the assumptions he made about my life based on my brother’s experiences without even considering that I am my own person.
My dad thinks people in same-sex relationships shouldn’t get married. He thinks we will continue to be discriminated against for the rest of our lives. He thinks that we won’t be able to have children of our own, that our relationships are purely based on lust and that we can never maintain our own relationships because of our lifestyle differences. He’s embarrassed and worried that the rest of our family will push us away. But he’s wrong, and I’m empowered to disprove his heteronormative way of thinking.
I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over a year. Though we’re separated by the distance between South Central and Westwood, we’ve continued to support and care for each other since we started college. We became friends by chance, and boyfriends by choice. It goes without saying that soon enough, I’ll bring him home and introduce him to my family.
I know that if I pursue a same-sex marriage in the future, I’ll still be able to have my own children. There are no wrong ways to build a family, whether it be by surrogate pregnancies or adoption.
Every gay, bi, lesbian or transgender person deserves a chance at living their own lives and finding happiness in their own ways. Sexuality is an important part of our identities, but it does not define every aspect of our lives. We’re still human, and we deserve the respect to be who we are no matter what.
Though my relationship with my parents has not been the same, I’m confident that I’ll be able to change their misconceptions in the future. I’m capable of anything a heterosexual person can do. I don’t need to be “normal.” I’m no longer afraid, no longer ashamed, no longer hiding in the shadows — I’ll continue fighting for my happiness, for my place in this world and for the life I want to live. I’m stronger now.”

With March comes the annual fanfare of college acceptance and rejection letters, both of which will cite strong leadership experiences — or lack thereof — as a key factor in college admissions panels’ decision-making. But according to one op-ed published Friday in The New York Times, leadership is, for myriad reasons, a problematic metric through which admissions panels make their decisions.
Writer Susan Cain’s op-ed has unearthed a dangerous, albeit unintentional, consequence of American colleges’ age-old obsession with leadership. That is, admissions panels’ oversimplified praise of “leaders” has subtly stigmatized and devalued the noble role of “follower,” and primed in students the false sense that effort and devotion to a cause or activity, however passionate they may be about it, are a waste of energy unless the pursuit satisfies traditional notions of what a leader is.
Cain, who also wrote Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking, cites numerous fundamental flaws with prioritizing and disproportionately glorifying leadership skills and experiences. There is, first and foremost, the simple fact that committed and genuine followers are requisite to any movement for change and reform, and to the success of any new, ambitious innovation.
According to Cain, leadership skills are conflated with dominance or being in a position of business or political power that allows an individual to “order people around” in today’s culture. Even when students do rise up as leaders, they are compelled to do so in pursuit of “stature” and resume-building rather than a call to service.
Across the nation, elite institutions fester in their obsession with leadership. On countless college application websites — such as those of Harvard, Stanford and Yale — “leadership” is listed among other qualities admissions officers look for, in addition to academic rigor and standardized test scores. In an effort to make time for club or executive board positions or titles that they can list on their applications, students cease to participate in volunteering programs or activism that are crucial to advancing humanitarian causes which benefit society as a whole, due to this precedent.
That is not to say that leadership positions and ambition are inherently the marks of greedy, grasping people. But in demanding that students empirically demonstrate leadership, all while doing little to counter traditional, rigid constructs of what leadership is, there is no denying that colleges have placed students under high pressure to put titles and narrow pursuit of advancement before work that they are genuinely committed to and passionate about.
Additionally, Cain notes the dangerous “romance of leadership” theory, a phenomenon in which all of an organization or movement’s successes or failures are sweepingly attributed to its leader. The theory tells society that CEO Mark Zuckerberg alone constructed the mass social media empire that is Facebook, and college admissions panels’ fixation on leadership goes hand-in-hand with telling students that their work only matters and will only receive recognition if it is associated with a title to demonstrate power and authority.
It may be that college admissions panels are no outlier in this situation. The devaluation of the role of the follower is present in nearly every sphere of society, but that being said, the solution could very well lie in an overhaul of the message colleges are sending to prospective students.
That is, colleges must offer a less nebulous definition of what constitutes leadership. In leaving this to the imagination, students will presume that they are referencing the traditional, societal definition of leadership, which is positions of power, plain and simple — and this will shape their every pursuit throughout their academic careers. Unless colleges clearly delineate what leadership is beyond being the president of a club, they are complicit in establishing a resume-building culture.
Beyond offering more inclusive definitions of leadership, colleges could also place less emphasis on or simply use the word less in an effort to destigmatize what it means to be a follower. Admissions panels could, instead, demand commitment, collaborative skills and devotion to students’ respective causes. These are, after all, the qualities and skills that drive movements.
But ultimately, perhaps it’s also time for colleges to reevaluate how they regard different experiences listed on applications and resumes. After all, defining leadership, calling for the skills of followers and refining their word choice can only do so much if they continue to singularly reward traditional leadership positions above all other extracurricular pursuits.

Undoubtedly, there has been a certain rise in consciousness about gender efforts within the last decade. Feminism and LGBTQ issues — although frequently co-opted in a problematic fashion — have at the very least entered mainstream discourse. Although growing in ubiquity, content that engages issues of equality is almost exclusively marketed toward young women and girls. An obvious contradiction then appears. How can a society effectively address inequality if only half the population receives the message? Both men and boys are essential partners to challenging gender roles and promoting equality.
The dearth of empowering content marketed toward men and boys appears to be the product of internalized false narratives. The wage gap and violence against women, for example, are framed as “women’s issues.” The wage gap is not merely a women’s issue when the average woman makes only 80 cents for every dollar men — the gatekeepers of privilege and power — earn. When women are the sole or co-breadwinner in more than half of American families, according to a December 2016 report by American Progress, and this unconscionable disparity affects not only women but also men and children.
Moreover, violence against women is not merely a women’s issue. It is, rather, primarily a men’s issue when men, with limited exceptions, are the sole perpetrators of violence against women. Narratives promoting a kind of toxic masculinity that values dominating women and devalues the expression of emotion and sensitivity not only embolden physical violence but also encourage violence that can be psychologically paralyzing for women and girls. Empowering content would dispose of false narratives and encourage both boys and men to choose empathy, rather than ego.
This shift in consciousness requires the cooperation of the media. For example, Teen Vogue is an example of a traditionally apolitical publication that has emerged as an influential voice on social and political issues.
Some of its stories from the past year include an interview examining what it means to be a Muslim woman in the Trump era and a list of reasons why Vice President Mike Pence’s record on reproductive and LGBTQ rights should give readers pause. Marketed exclusively toward teenage girls, Teen Vogue reaches its demographic at a formative point in its readers’ lives.
Where are the socially and politically conscious publications with young male readerships? Unfortunately, they are nowhere to be found. In their absence, young men and boys are left to consume stray copies of GQ, which is rife with hypersexualized images of women. Given the rise of digital media, reductive images of Kate Upton enjoying a popsicle in a bikini or a pop star in her underwear carrying a football helmet are just a few clicks away.
Men and boys will only become the effective partners needed when the media decides to challenge the norms it has promulgated and puts an end to the epistemic violence that has resulted. With 92 percent of teens reportedly going online daily according to the Pew Research Center, this campaign must begin on smartphones and computer screens.
Social media is the one of the easiest ways to promote and combat harmful stereotypes. Given the power to share, we have essentially become part of the “media,” crafting our own stories on our timelines. While we press traditional media to publish empowering content marketed toward both boys and men, we have a responsibility to be mindful of the content we share. The current political climate, as rooms full of men wield unimaginable influence over millions of lives, indeed demands that we ask more of the sources we consume and of ourselves.
