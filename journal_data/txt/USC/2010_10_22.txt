Slideshow: A look back at the Moving America Forward rally on Friday.
“We need all of you to fight on. We need all of you fired up.”
President Barack Obama’s words echoed across Alumni Park on Friday, where more than 37,500 students, faculty and visitors gathered to hear the president and prominent state politicians speak at a rally.
The president called on students to recreate the enthusiasm and voter turnout present during his 2008 election, as part of an effort to drum up support for California Democrats facing tough races this November. Gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown and Sen. Barbara Boxer served as the focal points of Friday’s “Moving America Forward” event, a rally organized by the Democratic National Committee and hosted by USC’s Political Student Assembly.

“The only way to fight it is all of you, all of these voices. All of you being committed to finishing what we started in 2008,” Obama said.
Lines for the event snaked past the boundaries of campus as students and visitors from across Southern California arrived at USC as early as 3:30 a.m. to ensure a spot in Obama’s audience.
Energy was high throughout the event, which started around 12:25 p.m. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa addressed the crowd, along with celebrities Kal Penn and Jamie Foxx. Several California politicians also spoke, including Assembly Speaker John Pérez and U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, before the stars of the show took the stage.
Brown gave a succinct speech in which he stressed his commitment to the state’s future.
“California has a place for all of us, not just some, not just the ones at the top who have most of the resources,” he said. “The country works when we share.”
Boxer, a third-term incumbent who is locked in a tight race with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, also spoke about the shared responsibility of voters — something she said Republicans failed to recognize.
“The other side is trying to depress voter turnout. They are hoping that you don’t vote in this election,” Boxer said. “They are hoping that you don’t see the choice in this election. They even sent around an ad telling the Latino voters to stay home.”
The consistent message from all of Friday's speakers was that voters — especially students — need to turn out to the polls on Nov. 2. Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
And then, with audience anticipation visibly mounting, Boxer introduced the president, who had to wait for applause and chants of “Yes we can” to die down before he spoke.
During his address, Obama emphasized what he said was the choice between past policies and future progress.
“You need to remember that this election is a choice between the policies that got us into this mess and the policies that are leading out of this mess,” he said. “Don’t let anybody tell you that our fight hasn’t been working. Don’t let them tell you that we’re not making a difference.”
Obama described the political atmosphere in Washington, D.C. as a car driven into a ditch by the Republicans during former President George W. Bush’s administration.
“It was a really deep ditch, and somehow they were able to walk away from the accident — but they didn’t get the car out of the ditch,” Obama said. “[Democrats] are pushing to get the car out of the ditch. And even though Barbara Boxer’s small, she’s pushing too.”
The important thing, he said, is to make sure Democrats maintain control of Washington.
“We’ve got to tell them, ‘You can’t have the keys back. You don’t know how to drive,’” Obama said. “‘You can ride with us, but you’ve got to be in the backseat.’”
The way to ensure this, Obama said, is for students to simply show up and vote on Nov. 2.
“If you knock on some doors and make some phone calls and keep marching and keep organizing,” Obama said. “We won’t just win this election. We are going to restore the American dream.”
Too bad that USC allowed themselves to be used as a pawn of the administration to highlight Boxer’s failed career as a California Senator.  She has been in Washington for 28 years with nothing substantial to show for it.  She supported the Obama healthcare bill, supported the stimulus that has not stimulated the economy, supports Cap and Trade, voted against the funding to provide protective equipment for the troops, voted to turn off the water in the Central Valley in favor of a fish causing family farmers to go bankrupt, is one of the reasons that CA has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, is self serving, voted for legislation causing such strict regulation on businesses that forced many companies to outsource jobs to foreign companies.  I wish that at least USC could have provided a forum for both sides of the argument so that students could have at least a complete picture of what they are voting for instead of a slanted view presented by this photo opportunity staged by the administration.
“It was a really deep ditch, and somehow they were able to walk away from the accident — but they didn’t get the car out of the ditch,” Obama said. “[Democrats] are pushing to get the car out of the ditch. And even though Barbara Boxer’s small, she’s pushing too.”
You think that’s just a tad condescending and patronizing for a speech on a university campus?  Ah, but the young, little Democrats need simple metaphors to understand really complicated politics that are way over their young, little heads and minds.
Is it not ironic that the “D” party, so focused on the environment, bails out the auto industry and uses auto metaphors to describe their way of governing when in their next breath they demonize the oil industry?
Note the lack of a presidential seal on the podium.  The only thing that made sense about his visit….
It would be nice if USC would have someone who is *actually* progressive address crowds of students on campus.  It would be better still if people truly wanted “change.”
Sad that this is the phony, platitudinous crap we’re stuck with.

At about 10 a.m. on Friday, Frank Jenkins, a first-grader from Tom Bradley Elementary Magnet School, arrived at USC to see the president speak.
“I wanna see Obama,” seven-year-old Frank said. “I never saw Obama.”

Frank — who said he thought Obama would be better to watch in person than on television “because you get to see him” — was one of 40 students from Bradley who attended the “Moving America Forward” rally, which was organized by the Democratic National Committee and hosted by USC’s Student Political Assembly.
About 37,500 people came to USC Friday to hear President Barack Obama speak. Obama drew positive reactions from the crowd, and encouraged young people to vote on Nov. 2. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
David Harrell, a program director at Bradley Magnet School, said he wanted to bring the group of children to the rally to expose them to someone they would not normally see — the president of the United States.
“They’re excited right now. It’s a [once in a] lifetime experience,” said Harrell, adding that one of his students began crying because of how close he would be to the president.
Harrell and Frank were two of the 37,500 people who attended Friday’s rally, including USC students, faculty, staff, community members and visitors from across California.
Lines began forming at entrance gates beginning at 3:30 a.m., though gates were not slated to open until 10 a.m. Clutching empty coffee cups and using umbrellas to shield themselves from a light rain, attendees said they were excited at the opportunity to hear Obama speak.
“I am just so happy that he’s here, not because he’s a black man, but because he’s a fine man,” said Betty Austin, 54, a retired nurse from Inglewood, Calif.
“He’s real. He goes and shakes their hands,” said Suzanne Reiman, who traveled from Palmdale, Calif. to USC for the rally. “Other politicians aren’t real like that,”
The event was open to the general public, but students from USC and other Southern California schools stood on risers behind the podium from which Obama addressed the students on the need for youth political involvement. Jonathan Brebner, president of USC College Democrats, was one of those students, and said it was an experience he would never forget.

“It’s really cool to be that close to the president and to get that excited about the political process,” Brebner said. “It was an absolute privilege. It was a lot of fun to be part of the rally — not just in the rally, but be part of it and feed energy into the crowd and feeding from it.”
Darryl Yip, a senior majoring in economics at Loyola Marymount University, said it is important for young people to hear their president speak.
“I went to the [former President Bill] Clinton rally at UCLA, and he said you can’t expect a president to lead if he can’t govern,” Yip said. “It’s really important for the president to be someone young people can look up to, to get people to vote.”
Several students said they believed hearing the president speak in person was a unique experience that many might not have again in their lifetime.
“It’s important that we get someone as big as the president to share his views and profess them on students and allow them to be knowledgeable about the world,” said Adam Mintz, a junior majoring in business administration. “I’m certainly willing to listen. I think it’s important for students to listen, whether they agree or disagree.”
According to an online Daily Trojan poll, 46 percent of about 700 voters said they were planning on attending the rally, while 32 percent of voters said they would not attend the rally because they had no interest in seeing the president and did not agree with Obama’s policies.
A few protests took place the morning of the rally near attendees waiting in line on 34th Street. One was hosted by the USC College Republicans and another staged a mock waterboarding in protest of the war in Afghanistan.
The general sentiment on campus, however, seemed to be enthusiastic about the president’s visit and his message promoting political involvement, Brebner said.
“Most people, I think, tend to sink into this idea that politics can be boring or it’s not relatable, but that’s not true at all,” Brebner said. “It’s really not boring. It’s completely relatable and it’s really exciting.”
Correction: 10/24/10: Adam Mintz was misidentified in a previous version of this story.  This entry has been corrected to reflect the change.
How Pathetic.
He hasn’t done anything in 2 years.
Why is he welcomed with open arms?
He’s made fools of everyone.

President Barack Obama’s trip to campus on Friday marked the fifth time that a sitting president had visited the University of Southern California.  Here’s a look back at some of the other notable presidential visits:

This was a good piece, but there was the incident of former VP Mondale getting booed at a rally on campus.  Sure he wasn’t the Pres, but that scared Dems away for many years.  When I was on the 2000 Dems campaign, they said no rallys at USC due to that incident.  After the election, however, Lieberman spoke to a packed Bovard and that seems to have restored faith in our student body.  The student body of the mid-80s was a lot more conservative than that of the 21st century.

On Friday, tens of thousands of people descended upon campus to see one man: President Barack Obama.
His visit had been the topic of conversation on campus even before it was officially announced, and students and faculty prepared for the rally that would mark only the fifth time a sitting president has visited USC. Professors cancelled classes. Students skipped study sessions. Secret Service agents searched buildings. Everyone at USC — and in Southern California — was excited for Obama.
But Friday came and went, and in its wake arose a plethora of mixed feelings. Some students were not happy that Obama’s message focused more on state and national politics than student-focused issues, while some lamented the fact that many lines to Alumni Park were poorly organized around a confusing system of different colored tickets. Many students who did not attend Obama’s speech on Friday were also upset at the inconveniences caused by having so many people on campus at once.
Still, many others felt that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and gave the president glowing reviews on his message.
All things considered, we want to know:
What are your thoughts about Obama’s visit to USC?
–
What do you think? Add your two cents to the conversation by submitting a comment in the entry form below.
I would never, in general, object to a U.S. President speaking at USC.  However, Mr. Obama used the campus to support political candidates rather than speak about significant national and/or world concerns.  If the campus is used as a political forum, would it not be appropriate to represent all sides?  Why were spokesmen from all other parties not invited to speak at the same time?  USC Administration has now set a very questionable precedent in allowing one side to speak without giving the same amount of time to opposing positions.  This is highly inappropriate in an academic setting. I am very disappointed.  I expected higher standards of behavior at USC.
I believe the administration needs to evaluate all outside speakers and their proposed speech topics more closely.  We should all be mindful that in a lively academic environment all sides of all issues need to be presented and discussed at the same point in time.
You are not serious!?!
Our so called leader is nothing more than a socialist.
Where is Sara?
As an SC alum, I was excited about the presidents visit and could only pick up an audio feed after the event took place. I also accessed the 360 degree interactive photo provided by the LA times. I must say that I was moved by the entire spectacle and very proud to be a Trojan on that special day.
Regardless of whether you agree with his politics, a visit by a sitting president  is a rare event and will only add to the level of prestige our university is trying to achieve. I am tired of being USC  being referred to, as the Stanford of the South or below the level of an Ivy school. We continue to move up college rankings in the various schools and overall are as high as #23 in the USNAWR.
Sounds like the large crowds were an inconvenience to a few souls who no matter what, would find something to complain about, and in my opinion, the benefits outweigh inconviences everytime. Fight On!
President Obama’s speech itself was amazing. Those of us in the crowd gawked at his ability to engage the crowd, yelled in agreement at his calls for CHANGE, and just reveled in his presence. We all know Obama isn’t doing everything we’d like him to do, otherwise there would be no national debt, war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and countless other issues. But I like to think that I took away a sense of enthusiasm and motivation to STAND UP and do SOMETHING at the rally yesterday. And for that, I am grateful. It truly was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Tonight’s women’s soccer game at the Coliseum kicks off at 7:00 on the West Coast.  All updates will be timestamped with game time. Be sure to check out our Twitter feed for instant info at http://www.twitter.com/dailytrojan
First half

10th minute: The Bruins have had two shots on goal so far, while the Women of Troy have yet to attempt a shot on goal.  The Bruins are controlling possession  though and taking their time on offense.
20th minute: The Bruins seem to be much more disciplined with the ball. The Women of Troy have not had many opportunities offensively so far and have had problems controlling possession.
28th minute: The Women of Troy get a free kick and senior forward/midfielder Megan Ohai collides with Bruin goalkeeper Chante’ Sandiford, knocking in the ball through the posts, but the goal is waved off by the referee.
40th minute: The Women of Troy seem look alive now after that goal was waved off.  They’re controlling possession, passing better and putting pressure on the Bruin backline. They’ve had multiple scoring opportunities, but have yet to convert.
42nd minute: Miscommunication between the Bruins defense and goalkeeper almost leads to a Women of Troy score. Sandiford vacates the goal, but senior midfielder Alyssa Davila’s shot is stopped.
Halftime recap:  The Bruins controlled the beginning of the first half, working the ball around both sides of the field and taking their time on offense.  On the other side, the Women of Troy started off slow to begin the game, but woke up after a Megan Ohai goal was waved off by the referee.  Both teams did not have many scoring opportunities in the first half and both defenses held strong in limiting shots on goal.
Second half
3rd minute: After a Bruin foul, the Women of Troy get a free kick just outside the penalty box. Redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval knocks a shot to the left side of the goalpost but is denied by Sandiford.
After getting denied of a goal, Sandoval picks up a yellow card after tripping a Bruin player in the 5th minute of the half. The game is starting to get physical, but the referee is using his whistle to make sure this game doesn’t get out of hand.
Both teams are starting to pick it up offensively. A scramble in front of the Bruin goal leads to a Women of Troy corner kick in the 12th minute, but it is cleared by the Bruin backline. Midfielder Brittany Kerridge knocks a shot from about 30 yards out, but it is stopped by Sandiford. Three minutes later, the Bruins receive a free kick that leads to a corner kick, but the Women of Troy clear the ball and no damage is done.
In the 22nd minute, Bruins midfielder Chelsea Cline goes after a ball and Women of Troy goalkeeper Shelby Church vacates goal. Cline tries slide tackling to get to the ball, but is penalized with a yellow card. Five minutes later, there is a scramble in front of the Bruins net. The Women of Troy get their feet on the ball multiple times, but fail to score. In the 29th minute, Bruins defender Lauren Barnes is penalized with a yellow card after running through Sandoval’s follow through on her kick.
85th minute: The Women of Troy finally break through on offense after defender Karter Haug places a ball to the left side of the penalty box. Forward Autumn Altamirano knocks a shot to the top right post and over the outstretched hands of Sandiford to give the team a 1-0 lead, and the victory.

The USC men’s golf team looks to keep up its forward progress in Alpharetta, Ga., at the United States Collegiate Championship this weekend. After a rough 15th place finish in its first tournament, and a rally for fifth in its next, USC looks to continue its upward swing and make an impact.
The consistent leader for the Trojans thus far has been sophomore T.J Vogel. Last week at the Jack Nicklaus Invitational in Columbus, Ohio, Vogel hit for an impressive fourth-place overall finish. Despite a hip injury early in the first tournament that kept him out of individual scoring, Vogel came back to shoot for stellar scores for the team in the second and third rounds. Vogel has been a consistent contributor since his fall 2009 debut, hitting 75 or better in 12 of his 17 rounds with the Trojans — four of which have come this season.
Also competing for the Trojans this weekend is freshman standout Jeffery Kang. Kang also tied for fourth last week, building upon a rough first tournament. Kang has been performing well in practice and is already well on track for an impressive freshman season.
Junior veteran Steve Lim is playing for the second time this season. Lim had three tough rounds last week, finishing at 39th overall in a performance that is off the mark from his usual dominance. Lim missed the first tournament of the season because of a family conflict.
In his freshman and sophomore years, Lim played impressively. He played in four events his sophomore year, one of which saw him hit USC’s season-best score. In his freshman year, Lim played in nine events and finished in the top 20 four times. Lim is the oldest player for the Trojans this weekend, and a return to form would almost surely mean success for the team.
Sophomore Sam Smith is playing again this weekend, after missing the Jack Nicklaus invite following a tough season debut. Smith was a contributor right from the start of his freshman year, playing in four events and posting some of the lowest scores for the team.
Freshman Ramsey Sahyoun makes his USC debut.
The action takes place Sunday through Tuesday at The Golf Club of Georgia’s Lakeside course. The Trojans face a tough field — five of the teams they face have already beaten them, and only one of the teams USC beat last week returns. Based on their recent improvement and stellar roster, USC looks to place well.

With a musical background that varies from thrash metal to teen pop and a peculiarly Christmas-related band name, the Brooklyn-based Sleigh Bells might seem all over the place to outsiders. But after receiving a surge of buzz when a few of their songs leaked onto the Internet last year, and then garnering even more attention after the official release of their debut album Treats back in May, the overnight success of Sleigh Bells is every aspiring musician’s dream come true.
On Wednesday, Los Angeles got a taste of this uniquely chaotic indie group when Sleigh Bells played a sold-out show at the El Rey Theatre to screaming fans who danced — much like the band’s recipe for super-stardom — all over the place.
Sleigh Bells is the brainchild of guitarist and producer Derek E. Miller, who has been working on the band’s distinct sound ever since departing from the hardcore band, Poison the Well.
He met vocalist Alexis Krauss while waiting on her and her mother at a Brazilian restaurant called Miss Favela in Brooklyn and thought Krauss’ dreamy voice was the missing ingredient to his blown-out guitar riffs and thumping drum beats.
How these two worlds of music can collide so beautifully makes absolutely no sense on paper, especially since Krauss’ creative oeuvre includes modeling for Nickelodeon Magazine, teaching grade school and singing in a teen pop band called Rubyblue.
The only possible explanation for the band’s mounting popularity is the kind of harmonious magic achieved only under the oddest of circumstances — their music’s artistic statement leaves a far greater impression to listeners than the sum of its parts.
And as a result, the band has performed at high-profile music festivals such as Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Pitchfork Music Festival over the past year, while many of their songs continue to be remixed and sampled by other artists of all musical genres.
Whether you get them or don’t get them, Sleigh Bells is truly the beginning of something special in the indie scene. To classify the band’s sound, which mixes noise rock, shoegaze, house and electro, would be an injustice to their varied group of fans. The best way to describe them is just loud.
So loud in fact that many of their songs feature heavy guitar riffs synthesized through some kind of “blown speakers” effect. The resulting sound is like putting the entire apocalypse in a blender and then asking a jaded Britney Spears to sing a lullaby over it all to balance everything out.
Their exaggerated sound seems to mirror our generation’s overall outlook toward the world — so melodramatic, so anxious and so optimistic that the speakers have already fizzled out by the time enough people start to listen, which is another explanation for their tremendous cult following.
But don’t be scared away by the aggressive demeanor. Beyond the many grindcore dance jams like singles “Crown on the Ground” and “Tell ’Em,” Sleigh Bells’ music also contains a smooth, balancing element that dominates certain songs more than others. “Rill Rill,” for instance, was a nice intermission for crowd members who were getting beaten up in the mosh pit.
With a full-sounding piano looped behind Krauss’ sensuous and whimsical vocals, it was almost like the venue had transformed into a Southern blues concert but filtered through a groovebox to maintain the established aesthetic.
Other songs use simplicity to dampen the shrilling guitar chords, such as the slow drum rhythm in “Run the Heart.” Krauss herself embodied the same schizophrenic attitude onstage — friendly, sweet and interactive with fans before tossing her hair back and diving headfirst into the crowd.
Signed to both Mom + Pop records and M.I.A.’s label N.E.E.T., it is safe to say that Sleigh Bells is only just beginning a very successful career. Though it might be a while before they have their sound completely mastered and release a new album, their live shows across the country are selling out at lightning speed. And for good reason, too — just ask my deaf ears, sore legs and smiling heart.
Don’t use a term if you don’t understand its meaning — “grindcore” refers to a genre of extreme metal originating in England, not blown-out, noisy electronic music. Other than that, not a bad article; Sleigh Bells are a cool group.
