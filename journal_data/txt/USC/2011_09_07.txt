It was all about the Barkley-Woods tandem Wednesday.
Standout · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who broke a USC single-game record with 17 receptions against Minnesota on Saturday, was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Despite several concerns surrounding a young Trojan team, most of the talk following USC’s mid-morning practice centered on junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods. In the season opener against Minnesota, Barkley and Woods connected for 17 receptions, 177 yards and three touchdowns in a 19-17 win.
“They prepare for things so well and focus on the game plan,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “Those guys are really fun to coach.”
The success of both has inspired the younger players, Kiffin said.
“They’re two of our best guys,” Kiffin said. “The best thing about that is you want young players and all of your players to see guys succeed and play well. Guys like [cornerback] Nickell Robey prepare well every single day and it shows up on gameday.”
With Utah expected to focus on stopping Woods on Saturday, Barkley noted USC’s offense also possesses other dangerous targets.
“If they happen to double team [Woods], that just leaves another guy open,” Barkley said. “We have a lot of weapons.”

It was announced earlier this week that senior tailback Marc Tyler had been reinstated following a one-game suspension and will be on the field Saturday against the Utes.
“We will see how the rest of the week goes,” Kiffin said. “He’s practiced really hard. We will mix him in there some and see what happens during the game.”
Tyler’s reinstatement means the Trojans will have a number of tailbacks in the mix against the Utes. Kiffin, however, feels Tyler’s size will benefit the Trojans.
“The rest of our ‘backs are under 200 pounds,” Kiffin said. “Those short yard situations that we came up short on [last week], a big ‘back has a tendency to make those.”
Freshman tailback D.J. Morgan was named the starter following his week one performance, but with Tyler’s return, it remains possible the depth chart could change again.
“I’ve been going with the ones, so I’m mentally preparing to be the starter,” Morgan said. “If not, I’m still ready to go in the game. I just have to capitalize when my number is called, when I get the ball and every time when I’m on the field blocking or running.”
Barkley, who was forced to throw the ball 45 times against Minnesota, is pleased with Tyler’s return.
“It’s good to have him back,” Tyler said. “He’s a great player for us. [Tyler] is a back you could tell was missing last week. He’s come a long way since that incident happened. He will be able to help us out a lot on Saturday.”

Though Utah heads west to face the Trojans, the Coliseum hasn’t provided them with a significant home field advantage as of late. Three of USC’s five losses last season were at home, and against Minnesota on Saturday, USC played in front of a crowd of under 70,000.
“I don’t think it has to do with the Coliseum or the fans. It had to with us playing real well,” Kiffin said. “If you want the playing rocking and a lot of energy — play well, win games and score touchdowns.”
Barkley said he hopes the home crowd Saturday will be vivacious.
“Hopefully, a little more crowd noise when they are on offense,” Barkley said. “Hopefully, more seats are filled.”
—
Last week, rumors of further expansion of the Pac-12 conference circulated around college football, even more so on Wednesday as Texas A&M announced it would leave the Big XII for the SEC.
“We just got used to this one,” Kiffin said. “Whatever happens, we’ll figure it out. We don’t spend very much time on it at all. It’s out of our control.”
—
Though much hype surrrounds the inaugural Pac-12 conference game, the Trojans are looking at Saturday’s match-up like another game.
“I  think there will be a lot of energy around it,” Kiffin said “I’m sure it’s a huge game for them coming down to the Coliseum regardless [of it] being the conference opener. For us, first place in the division is on the line. We want to improve.”
Despite all the excitement surrounding this game, Barkley sees Utah like any other opponent.
“I don’t see the significance other than another regular season game that we have to win in our conference,” Barkley said. “I guess you could say it is special because we are treating every game like a bowl game. As compared to last week, no, we’re approaching it with the same mentality.”

USC senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge’s two-assist, one-goal weekend in the Illini/Boilermaker Cup has earned her a pair of national honors.
Kerridge was named to the Soccer America Team of the Week and as a Primetime Performer of the Week by CollegeSoccer360.com.
Kerridge scored a penalty kick in the Trojan’s 3-1 upset win over previously unbeaten No. 17 Illinois on Friday in Champaign, Ill., and assisted in the game-winning goal.
Two days later she got the assist in the Women of Troy’s 63rd-minute equalizer against Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind., a game  the Women of Troy went on to win in overtime.
Kerridge leads USC in both goals and assists, with three and four respectively, and is third on the team in minutes played. She has been involved (either scoring or assisting) in seven of the Women of Troy’s 11 goals, and has converted both of USC’s penalty-kick attempts this season.
She assisted on USC’s first goal of the season in its opener against Long Beach State on Aug. 19. A week later against Kansas she again assisted on the Women of Troy’s first goal of a game, and then scored on a free-kick to tie the game just before halftime. Against Pacific on Aug. 28, she scored from the penalty spot in what would end up being the game-winning goal in the Trojan’s first victory of the season. Despite her performance early in the season, USC came up short in its first three games.
Recently, her play has been instrumental in USC’s turnaround from 0-3 to 3-3 and also earned her a spot on the Illini/Boilermaker Cup All-Tournament Team.
She and the rest of the Women of Troy face another tough task and another tournament this weekend as they return home to host the Trojan Invitational at McAlister Field.
San Diego will face off against Texas on Friday at 1 p.m., followed by USC hosting No. 4 Oklahoma State at 3:30 p.m.
Sunday’s matchup will feature the Toreros and the Cowgirls at 10 a.m., before the Women of Troy finish up the tournament against Texas at 12:30 p.m.

It worked against unranked Minnesota. It might not this week.
Despite poor playcalling and a few other head-scratching decisions against the Golden Gophers, USC managed to notch a win Saturday in its season opener. But if USC coach Lane Kiffin follows the same script against Utah, the Trojans could be looking at a souring 1-1 record to start the season — or perhaps even more glaring — a 0-1 mark in the Pac-12.
In retrospect, it’s easy to say Kiffin made several odd coaching decisions Saturday, with the two failed two-point conversion attempts and the turnover on downs that could have otherwise given life to an offense that failed to score at all in the second half.
It’s understandable he wants to take some chances to live up to the infamous chants students used to show support for former coach Pete Carroll.
But the more disturbing trend, one that will put USC at a serious disadvantage against the upper-echelon Pac-12 teams, is that Kiffin doesn’t seem to trust all of his players.
He’s confident in junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods — that’s for sure. Looking at the play-by-play for the Minnesota game, though, reveals that he lacks any sort of confidence in the offensive line. The vast majority of Barkley’s 45 pass attempts were short tosses, as he averaged only 6.8 yards per attempt and registered only nine connections for 10 yards or more, according to ESPN.com’s play-by-play game breakdown.
Then there’s the uncharacteristically imbalanced offensive game: along with Barkley’s 45 air attempts, there were only 28 carries.
Kiffin isn’t ready to trust his line to protect Barkley long enough to throw deep routes, and he’s not ready to live on the ground until he’s satisfied the run blocking is top-notch.
The reliance on the pass might render the offense one-dimensional, something a more seasoned team like Utah will capitalize on. In fact, once Minnesota started double-covering Woods on almost every play, the offense halted altogether. And as a result, USC went scoreless in the second half.
And the Gophers didn’t even have the benefit of recent game tape. You can be sure Utah coach Kyle Whittingham is going to have his players prepared for a pass-heavy plan from USC, who won’t have the element of surprise on its side in the first half of the game. That could be trouble for the Trojans and put a lot of pressure on that yet-unproven defense.
More troubling than even the lack of faith in the offensive line, though, was the repeated shelving of freshman kicker Andre Heidari, recruited out of Bakersfield, Calif., to patch up the kicking problems with Joe Houston last year. Kiffin said himself Heidari has range out to 52 yards. The way he treated him Saturday didn’t reflect that.
The two-point conversion attempts notwithstanding — as there’s little doubt Kiffin trusts Heidari to kick an extra point — a pair of fourth-down decisions against Minnesota exposed Kiffin’s hesitancy to go with the new guy.
In the third quarter, up 19-10 at the Minnesota 20-yard line, USC elected to go for it on fourth down, despite being well within field-goal range. A rush attempt from redshirt freshman resulted in no gain, and the Trojans turned the ball over.
In the fourth quarter up 19-17 at the Minnesota 32-yard line, Kiffin elected to take the delay-of-game penalty and punt rather than give Heidari the chance to put USC up five and force the Gophers to get into the end zone.
Why not give him the chance to kick?
Even driving from the 32-yard line with two minutes left to play is going to be difficult, and USC has the opportunity to remove a field goal from Minnesota’s options if Kiffin decides to kick the field goal.
The defense for the early two-point conversion attempts was Kiffin wanting to get practice going for two in game situations. Then why wouldn’t he want to practice the long field goal in a game situation, too?
It seems like a bit of a double standard.
Had redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris not made up for a bad game in the secondary with his game-ending interception, Minnesota likely could have driven into field-goal range, nailed the kick and sent the Trojans home with a loss to start the season.
With Utah’s strong running game, its more experienced secondary and the general unpredictability and potential for upset that comes along with conference play, Kiffin’s going to have to limit his role in how the team plays, step back and let the players he assembled handle the game execution.
Otherwise, the now-unranked Trojans might not be as fortunate.

Football was never easy, at least for Randall Telfer.
Most players in high school had years of experience playing Pop Warner football or other youth leagues.
Threat · Redshirt freshman tight end Randall Telfer had two receptions in Saturday’s home opener and is still jockeying for a starting position. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Telfer, a redshirt freshman tight end at USC, didn’t play organized football before high school. He didn’t understand the game, either.
“The very first time I played football and suited up was my freshman year in high school,” Telfer said. “I had no idea what to do and no idea where to go.”
Despite this, the 6-foot-4, 225-pound Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., native still drew the attention of college recruiters before stepping onto the field.
“I hadn’t even played a game of football yet,” Telfer said. “One of our offensive tackles was being recruited by Stanford and my coach introduced me to the head coach and he said he’d have his eye out for me.”
His high school coaches placed him at wide receiver and Telfer had to learn on the fly. But before he could see the field, ahead of him on the depth chart were guys quicker and more talented.
“My freshman and sophomore year, I was playing receiver and we had a lot of really fast guys,” Telfer said. “They had the track guys playing receiver, so seeing the playing field wasn’t really an option.”
Playing time was scarce during his first two years, until the coaching staff moved him to tight end. That’s when Telfer figured out the game and decided football was his sport.
“Once I moved to tight end my junior year, that’s when it really clicked with me and I found my true calling in football,” he said.
Despite not playing much his first two years in high school, Telfer put in the time to get better, to refine his craft. When junior year rolled around, it was then that he saw results.
Telfer had 44 receptions for 678 yards and five touchdowns. He was recognized for his outstanding play, garnering several awards while helping lead Rancho Cucamonga High School to a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) title.
More colleges started taking notice of Telfer, including most of the Pac-10 schools at the time like Washington, California, Arizona State, Oregon and, of course, USC.
Ultimately, Telfer chose USC, choosing a football program with a rich history that had dominated the college football landscape for the better part of the decade.
“Ever since I was a little kid, I knew I wanted to go here,” he said. “A lot of my family came here, I grew up around here and of course, the great tradition.”
Even when former coach Pete Carroll left to coach the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks at the end of the 2009 season and the NCAA handed down sanctions, Telfer stuck to his commitment.
But at the time, then-junior tight end Rhett Ellison and former tight end Jordan Cameron were ahead of Telfer on the depth chart. Once again, he found himself in a familiar position — on the sidelines.
Redshirting a year, however, didn’t hurt his prospects. Ellison, one of the four captains on the team this year, has seen the development in his understudy.
“He’s faster, he’s stronger and he’s figuring out the offense,” Ellison said. “He’s holding his own and it’s like night and day from last year.”
Telfer also cites Ellison’s leadership and experience as a positive aspect that has helped him grow as a player.
“Coming in here as a freshman, looking up to Rhett, he’s been a great mentor,” Telfer said. “Everybody can look up to [him] and everybody can take away something from him because he’s been around for so long.”
Fast forward one year: Cameron was drafted by the NFL’s Cleveland Browns and Ellison moved to fullback in fall camp.
With nobody guaranteed to open the season as a starter, this gave an opportunity for Telfer to challenge redshirt freshman tight end Xavier Grimble and sophomore tight end Christian Thomas for the job.
Grimble started the game in last weekend’s season home opener against Minnesota. The coaching staff, however, has yet to name a definitive starter, leaving playing time and that No. 1 position still wide open.
Even at USC, Telfer hasn’t been guaranteed anything, hasn’t been given the job on a silver platter — he fully knows he has to go get it himself.
“Rhett’s move to fullback has motivated me more because he’s gone and it’s my turn to step up,” Telfer said. “I’m motivated to get more playing time. It’s driven me to practice harder and work harder.”

On an afternoon when sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods’ school-record 17 receptions, three touchdowns and 177 yards set the social media world ablaze in the hours following USC’s 19-17 win over Minnesota, the man directly responsible for the sophomore wideout’s performance had no idea what the fuss was all about. After all, he was too busy making his USC coaching debut.
Showing the ropes · USC wide receivers coach Ted Gilmore, pictured with senior wide receiver Brandon Carswell, uses a different coaching style compared to others. Rather than yell and scream, Gilmore believes showing respect is important in teaching football. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“Honestly, I had no idea he had that many catches,” wide receiver coach Ted Gilmore said. “In the course of a ball game, I don’t really care who catches the ball as long as it’s being caught. I was happy for the young man because of the type of work he puts in on the practice field. That’s his moment though and his moment alone.”
Though it would be easy for Woods to bask in his newfound stardom, the second-year wide receiver has not been shy in trying to share the limelight with his first-year receiver coach.
“Since the day [Gilmore] stepped on this campus, he has been pushing me to become a better receiver,” Woods said. “People see me making the plays, but he’s the one who takes the time to really teach me. Every thing he taught me was on display Saturday. And the great thing about him, is even after the Minnesota game, he believes he can still get more production out of me.”
Gilmore’s name will likely never trend nationwide on outlets such as Twitter like his star pupil’s did Saturday, but in his first season at USC, the 44-year-old position coach isn’t concerned with recognition or popularity. He’s here to teach.
“I am just happy to be able to coach [Woods] every day,” Gilmore said.
Though he graduated from the University of Wyoming with a sociology degree in 1991, the former college standout — 72 receptions and five touchdowns between 1988 and 1989 — admits he didn’t graduate thinking he would ever enter the coaching world. When he returned to Laramie, Wyo., in 1994 as a graduate assistant, he recalls the move was more or less a chance for him to buy some time before choosing an actual profession. What he quickly found out, however, was that he was born to teach the game.
“That fire for athletics was rekindled when I came back,” Gilmore said. “I wanted to make a difference in the lives of young men, and I found that in coaching.”
After serving as Nebraska’s wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator for the last six years, the Wichita, Kan., native said when USC coach Lane Kiffin approached him last winter to replace John Morton, it was an opportunity he simply couldn’t refuse.
Though the pressure of coaching at a tradition-steeped university like USC can be daunting, especially considering what is at stake every Saturday, Gilmore, a devout Christian, coaches the only way he knows how. His teachings require no cursing or screaming, but instead show a rare quality typically unseen on a college football field: a genuine respect for his players.
“My philosophy when coaching these guys is to coach them the way I would if they were my children, with respect and in a manner that isn’t degrading,” Gilmore said. “We cannot forget that we are teachers first and foremost.”
Freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, who in three months has leapt from prized recruit to starting wide receiver, believes his progress has everything to do with Gilmore’s passion for making him a better player and man on and off the field.
“He just has such a big heart and is always willing to help me in every way possible,” Lee said. “I am not going to lie, I mess up everyday. But he doesn’t give up on me, he keeps pushing me to make sure that I am ready to play come Saturday.”
With just a game under his belt, the rookie of the USC coaching staff admits he is still getting his feet wet in Los Angeles. But just seven months on the job, Gilmore’s already proud of the new students he’s had the privilege of working with.
“We ask our players to stretch themselves all the time, and I have had to do the same in my first year in terms of learning a new playbook and a new way of doing things,” Gilmore said. “It’s been a good experience thus far, and it doesn’t hurt having young men like we do here, who have such high character.”
For some, the thrill of the spotlight makes the grind of coaching worthwhile.
In Gilmore’s eyes, whether it’s coaching wide receivers or potentially getting the call to one day run his own program, the joy comes not from Twitter trendiness, but from having a hand in developing great football players and even better men.
“If I am fortunate enough, I would love to sit in that head coaching seat one day,” Gilmore said. “But, for the meantime, my job is to do the best I can here under my current position. I just want to continue doing what I am doing, and that’s coaching. Regardless of what capacity that may be in.”

Fleet Foxes @ Greek Theatre 
In celebration of their recent album Helpless Blues, which came out May 3, Fleet Foxes have commenced their international tour. Luckily for USC students, they’ll be making a pit stop at the Greek Theatre on Sept. 14.
Between their beautiful vocal harmonies, folk twang and perfect instrumental craftsmanship, Fleet Foxes are not ones to be missed, especially in the prime location that is the Greek Theatre.
With its enchanting forest-like outdoorsetting, full of luscious trees and a clear night sky — a rarity in Los Angeles — the Greek Theatre was practically made for the nature inspired folk singers. Not to mention, the Griffith Park Observatory is right next door and definitely worth checking out as well.
Embrace the beautiful scenery, enjoy the likes of “White Winter Hymnal” and “Blue Spotted Tail” and rejoice in the splendorous vocal harmonies of Fleet Foxes. Tickets are still available, so grab them if you haven’t already.
 
The Brady Bunch Movie
Looking for a blast from the past?
Santa Monica’s Aero Theatre will be hosting a Sherwood Schwartz tribute Friday with a screening of The Brady Bunch Movie. Schwartz passed away in 2011, but his memory lives on with the legacies he created in hit TV series such as Gilligan’s Island and The Brady Bunch.
In The Brady Bunch Movie, Schwartz’s beloved sitcom characters come to life on the big-screen as anachronistic protagonists trying to fit in during the ’90s. Filled with life lessons, classic sappy moments and spurts of Schwartzian comedy, The Brady Bunch Movie is sure to rekindle old memories and provide an enjoyable experience for audience members of any age.
As an added bonus, Gary Cole and Shelly Long (Mr. and Mrs. Brady), along with Betty Thomas (director), Jim Berg and Stan Zimmerman (writers) will be present after the screening for a discussion.
Be sure to check out this timeless event at Aero Theatre, Friday Sept. 9 at 7:30 p.m. — tickets are available at americancinemathequecalendar.com.
 
Leonard Nimoy Lecture
With his recent photographic display at the Annenberg Space for Photography’s “Beauty Culture” exhibition, Leonard Nimoy (yes, we’re talking about Spock from Star Trek) has been gaining more recognition in the art world. He’s set to lecture at the Hammer Museum Tuesday, Sept. 13.
“Secret Selves,” which explores the Greek myth in which God split all humans into two, is Nimoy’s newest endeavor. Specifically, Nimoy captured his subjects’ secret identities, asking them to reveal this other half to the camera. But Nimoy isn’t just putting his subjects’ personal lives on display; he’ll also reveal what he learned about his secret self in his artistic process.
With over a hundred revealing photographs, a question and answer session with Heroes and Star Trek actor, Zac Quinto, and insight from the photographer himself, this is one event in the art world you won’t want to miss.
Admission is free but be sure to arrive early as space is limited.

Imagine what it would be like if the city came alive — if all the little shops in Downtown Los Angeles suddenly sprouted legs and began to walk around, talking and mingling with one another. It’s a pretty strange image, isn’t it?
City walk · Little Tokyo is the inspiration for much of Levochkin’s latest exhibition, giving rise to snapshots of cityscapes walking and bursting with colors, designs and images, creating the raw feel of a phantasmagoria. - Photo courtesy of Gorgeous PR
But that’s exactly what happens in Gosha Levochkin’s 27 original paintings, including a collaboration with Los Angeles street artist Cyrcle, in Levochkin’s latest exhibition, “Cluster Mess” — a term he says refers to the clustered, yet amazing space of an urban city like Los Angeles.
Inspired by Little Tokyo, Levochkin’s ink and watercolor pieces come alive. Each one showcases a different aspect of Little Tokyo, including street vendors, meat shops and other compact city buildings that are personified as humans who interact with one another and make the city whole.
“I love the compact space and how amazing they make it,” Levochkin said of his inspiration. “It’s clustered. Clean, but sloppy.”
The most interesting aspect of the exhibition is the floating clouds painted on the gallery walls. The wires of countless telephone poles growing from these clouds connect every piece of art, representing the interconnectedness of the city.
And just like the motley ethnic composition of Los Angeles, the creatures that comprise this artistic and dynamic city are just about every color you can imagine — some a patchwork of bright, intense color softened only by its watercolor and sketch-like quality.
The style is quirky and cute, but also biting. It’s in your face, while innocently taking a back seat to the personality of Los Angeles.
In “Falling Meats,” a hunched-over boy with a meat stand protruding from his back doesn’t seem weighed down by the burden he carries, but instead seems bursting with energy as colors explode out of the stand and practically bounce off the page.
Color similarly explodes and creates new perspectives in “Fan Boy,” a hidden gem near the restroom that seems to take parts of the city and push them through a fan, creating a whirlwind of new textures, colors and emotions.
The works seem to grow in intensity as you make your way around the gallery. An especially eye-catching and noteworthy piece is “Cluster,” one of the show’s larger pieces, which was Levochkin’s inspiration for the entire progressive series.
“Cluster” is, as the name would suggest, a clustered painting with a lot going on. From the city’s flowing green hair to a street block with Japanese shops to amorphous blobs of color swooping their way onto the page, the painting represents the hectic, ordered chaos that is Los Angeles — and even, quite possibly, Levochkin’s hometown of Moscow.
Levochkin grew up accustomed to the big city. Though this is only his second solo showing, he said it has already been one of his most fun.
As for materials, Levochkin used his own, one-of-a-kind paints made by a Belgian artist — also on display in the exhibition — helping create the surreal, dreamlike cityscapes with a bright, yet soft color palette.
Though “Cluster Mess” is charismatic, Levochkin intends for the viewer to look beyond the interesting aesthetics and encourages the audience to learn more about the characters — to imagine themselves in the world he created.
It’s a goal that’s certainly accomplished. As you walk from painting to painting and scene to scene, the characters seem to walk along with you, telling you the story of the city, as if to say, “Here is a clustered street corner with shops as far as the eye can see and here is a struggling street vendor with his mind on business.”
While it’s definitely a more playful style than what we’re accustomed to seeing in galleries, it’s nonetheless a thought-provoking narrative of the city.
“I’m never thinking about color when I paint,” Levochkin said. “At the end of the day, [it’s about] pleasing myself, and I think I’ve done that.”

It could take seconds to tear down years of work and we won’t get these days back again, lead vocalist Sam Carter rages before sliding seamlessly into ’90s punk-rock-influenced vocals on “Day In Day Out,” the opening track on United Kingdom metal band Architects’ newest album The Here and Now.

The band took these lyrics to heart as it prepared to go on an international tour to promote its record, which dropped in January to mixed reviews by critics.
Before leaving the United Kingdom, Carter said he “spent a lot of time with [his] girlfriend and family,” since he would be away for such a long period. Band mate Dan Searle even had to prepare for drumming with tour mate Bring Me The Horizon, whose drummer was injured playing soccer.
But now, currently on the U.S. leg of their tour, the band mates are ready to display the new sound found in The Here and Now.
“It’s changed. You’ve got to progress,” Carter insisted about the record’s sound compared to its predecessor Hollow Crown, which was praised as an impressively riveting thrill ride. “We’ve always been into punk. It was a very natural thing. We wanted to do it and go in the right direction. It came out good mixing different types of music.”
It came out better than good. Yet, it was those classic metal stylings that won Architects their international fan base. Hollow Crown cemented a worldwide audience for the U.K. band with its intense instrumentation and Carter’s memorable vocals. The accompanying promotional tour through Australia and the United Kingdom allowed the band to captivate new fans around the world. The United States, however, has proven itself as a rough crowd for Architects, and Carter seems wary about touring here.
“No one in the U.S. really likes us, where as everywhere else in the world they do,” Carter reflected, understandably confused. “The U.S. is tough.”
But the ambition in Architects shines through.
“Were gonna keep trying until it works,” Carter said.
And trying they are. Sam Carter, along with band mates Tim Hillier-Brooks (guitar), Dan Searle (drums), Tom Searle (guitar) and Alex “Ali Dino” Dean (bass guitar) recently stormed Los Angeles to perform with Parkway Drive and Bring Me The Horizon. The tour is billed as “The Greatest Show on Earth,” complete with “Madness & Mayhem!”
Though Parkway Drive has been delayed in its arrival, Carter is excited about his band’s other tourmate.
“Bring Me [The Horizon’s] great!” Carter said. “We always love touring with them. They’re like our best friends — during the day we always joke around during sound check.”
Attitudes like this make for great touring chemistry, especially when touring for a long time. The road can get tedious and boring, but the band has its head on straight. To keep things fresh and stay inspired, Carter said he and the band sit around, talk and drink a lot. What else would you expect from a group of twenty-year-olds living the dream?
But the band isn’t wasting time partying everyday. The inspiration goes deeper.
“We’re writing.” Carter said. “We recorded two new songs that will be coming out by the end of the year. And we’re recording in January.”
Consistently thinking about the next step, the creative juices for Architects are always flowing. Carter added he has “been listening to some atmospheric stuff” while touring.
When asked about where these musical influences would take Architects, he simply said, “Who knows what will happen?”
Carter promised a rocking evening, and the band is sure to deliver. The combination of sounds — new and old — will be interesting to witness.
Architects is definitely a band to see. Comfortable with experimentation in sights and sounds, this group is composed of young guys who have their wits about them, artistically motivated and ready to take their music to the next level of metal.
The band will be touring the United States throughout the fall with fellow acts Bring Me The Horizon, Parkway Drive, Deez Nuts and While She Sleeps. If home for a weekend or break, be sure to see where the Architects are performing.

The power of photography should never be underestimated.
With one shot you can move virtually anyone to tears, anger or happiness. In one photograph, you can even incite the rage of hundreds of people.
This fact should’ve been taken into consideration by the Canadian beauty salon Fluid. In a series of photographs, the salon took its slogan, “Look good in all you do,” to disturbing new heights with a shocking series of photographs. Since late August and early September, Fluid has received a lot of flack for its poor taste in advertising.
One photograph features a woman pulling a dead body out of a hearse. Another depicts a woman who looks as if she’s just been in a motorcycle accident.
But the ad that got people’s skin crawling and tempers flaring was the photograph showing a woman with a bruised eye sitting on a couch with a man behind her. The same “Look good in all you do” slogan is present, making the ad seem to suggest that you can look good even as a victim of domestic abuse.
Naturally, those who have fought against abuse or know someone who has could not help but be offended at the advertisements. To make matters worse, the salon defended the ads; salon owner Sarah Cameron told people to “please interpret the ads as freedom dictates — that is your right — just as artistic expression is our right.”
Unfortunately, the term “artistic expression” is a trite one, often used as an excuse for almost anything these days. When an artist creates something confusing or controversial, the go-to justification is oftentimes these two words.
But what this salon does by calling its advertisements art is shedding a bad light on a freedom that allows artists to create positive, pleasing works.
“Artistic expression” is what results from the passion of an artist who experiments with cans of paint, performs for an audience or creates something otherwise stunning. It has nothing to do with creating pieces that could quite possibly ridicule a very serious and dangerous act like domestic abuse.
If the advertisements were meant for shock value, Fluid shouldn’t have tried to cover up using “artistic expression” — viewers deserve the truth. There are artists who express themselves with less-than-pleasant works, but this shock value is inherently part of their image and approach to art. What’s more, not all artists are trying to convince people of a certain viewpoint, while these advertisements are obviously meant to persuade potential customers to drop by the salon to look good.
And though the advertisements are specific to their salon, the images are powerful to anyone, anywhere. The salon has used the power of photography to virtually surpass the need for words — almost any woman walking by the ad would understand the message.
The domestic abuse scene could mirror the lives of many women from different walks of life. Just one glance of these photographs could excite emotions in people that have nothing to do with getting a perm.
Controversial art pieces can be found throughout history, from Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 “Fountain,” — a urinal signed with the name R. Mutt — to Andres Serrano’s 1987 “Piss Christ” — a photograph of a plastic cruficix inside a jar of Serrano’s urine — and even Banksy’s contemporary street murals.  Duchamp and Banksy’s work might be seen as comical, but “Piss Christ” was actually damaged by angry protestors. Various artists have abused the term “artistic expression” as well, but this only serves to show that perhaps some topics, such as domestic abuse, are better left untouched.
Concern about offending audiences will always be an issue, but artists should consider the consequences of being insensitive.
As for the ads, Cameron has promised to donate money to Edmonton’s women’s shelter when someone mentions the ad inside her salon. Even still, the public is unlikely to be placated so easily. In fact, a street tagger took action into his or her own hands and spray-painted a simple but effective message over the ad depicting domestic abuse: “That was violence wrongly named art.”
In creating the ads, the salon is not only being insensitive, but also creating an inaccurate picture of what art is. It is unfair that these photographs cast a negative light on the term “artistic expression.” Artistic expression is much more.

“Posing Beauty in African American Culture,” presented by the USC Fisher Museum of Art, delivers a visual feast of stunning photographs attempting to discuss what it has meant to be “black and beautiful” throughout black history.
Progressive pick · The frequent use of iconic symbols and figures in images pervade “Posing Beauty in African American Culture,” USC’s newest photography exhibition at the Fisher Museum of Art. - Photo courtesy of USC Fisher Museum of Art
The leading themed section, “Constructing a Pose,” offers a snapshot into the lives of blacks through both natural and directed posing.
The photos, “Prom Night — Here Comes the Girls Pomp and Circumstance” and “Prom Night — Hi De Ho Man: Pomp and Circumstance,” reflect and heighten the excitement and confidence black high school students felt on prom night.
Dressed in an array of colors, skimpy dresses and dyed hair, the ladies kiss and pose for the camera while the young man stares straight ahead in a white suit, top hat and cane.
This is a group of kids who puts effort into looks for a fun night in which reality can be discarded in favor of dancing, music and magic.
Other noteworthy photos include 1964’s “Bruce Davidson, Body Builder on Venice Beach, CA.” Symbolic of a race often used for entertainment and servitude, a woman takes a photo of a gigantic, black bodybuilder on the beach, who poses for her, becoming the main attraction. The photo serves as a commentary on the societal objectification of the black and African American image.
In an explosion of self-expression, the “Young Man in Plaid, NYC” illustrates the need to release oppressed feelings through clothes, makeup and hair choices. These themes are explored in many other photos — whether with black power uniforms or afros and disco pants, freedom of expression takes a literal meaning through visual presentation.
“Body and Image” similarly explores the varying levels of black culture, as it consists of alluring photographs displaying the tantalizing faces and bodies of different men and women. One particular group from the “Plastic Bodies” exhibit shows a series of four Barbie portraits.
One shows a Barbie with one blue eye and one brown eye, illustrating the black woman’s eternal dilemma: attempting to embrace her beauty in society, even though her DNA denies her of it. The black woman is forever pulling away from herself toward society’s “ideal” of beauty.
“Modeling Beauty and Beauty Contests,” on the other hand, tells the history of a culture through people instead of events. Particularly enticing is a shot of Pam Grier among dozens of other beautiful women from a compilation of student-turned-model photographs, similar to the JET Girl of the Month specials in the present day.
Even more famous faces run rampant throughout the exhibit, including the likes of Denzel Washington and Lena Horne.
The exhibition’s photos are amplified by the small and intimate Fisher Museum. The individual sections are not tremendously powerful on their own, but as a whole the exhibit is very striking. The contrast of white walls let the artwork stand out while black glossy floors reflect the black, faces hanging above.
The exhibit does require some prior knowledge of black history in order to fully grasp the striking statements it makes; however, there is room for the viewer’s own artistic interpretation. There are no explanations or detailed descriptions next to the artwork — the decisions are based on the photos alone.
All in all, the exhibit is enthralling, but one moving and impressive photo stood out above the rest. It features a young girl in a white dress standing in the middle of Harlem, smiling sweetly at the camera, completely innocent and unaware of the hustle and bustle taking place around her.
This sort of innocence can’t erase the painful history blacks have lived through, but it can begin to propel the world forward into an understanding and accepting society, proving that there is hope for coexistence and peace after all.
The exhibit runs Sept. 7 through Dec. 3 with a reception celebrating the opening Oct. 4.

Smoking is a right
This summer, the University of Michigan became the latest victim in a trend sweeping America.
Joining more than 500 universities, Michigan implemented a 100 percent ban on smoking on campus. Is USC next? It sure looks like it.
In the latest Graduate and Professional Student Senate meeting, an informal poll showed support for a campus ban on smoking.
The faculty and undergraduate senates have already passed motions in favor of a ban.
It might only be a matter of time before they enact one.
Support for the ban stems from health concerns and rights: People have the right to smoke-free oxygen.
This is what Rebecca Gao argued in the April 10 issue of the Daily Trojan in the article “Smoke-free Campus must become a reality.”
I don’t deny that smoking is harmful. Cancers of the esophagus, lung, mouth, larynx and throat are linked to smoking. In the United States, smoking related deaths total about 440,000 each year (about .15 percent of the population).
But should USC really ban smoking? I think not.
Thirteen percent of deaths each year are a result of cancer. So why are we worried about saving 440,000 when millions more need immediate help? Why not direct our efforts to reduce breast cancer, prostate cancer or leukemia, the three most common cancers among women, men and children respectively?
The risks associated with second hand smoke are minimal compared to other diseases that plague humans.
As such, one can’t help but see this ban as the non-smoking majority oppressing a smoking minority population.
Gao and I, though, do have two similarities: We are non-smokers and we believe smoking causes negative health effects. But so do many other types of smoke.
If we ban smoking today, where does it end? What will we ban tomorrow?
Should we ban barbeques on USC game days? Charcoal burns a lot “dirtier” than tobacco; it releases minute particles that pollute the air and are many times more harmful to our lungs than tobacco smoke. So, should we ban BBQ smoke as well? I think not.
If Gao really believes we should be “able to walk from one end of campus to the other without shortening our life expectancies,” why not ban Carl’s Jr. from campus? Or Panda Express? Or any of the other restaurants whose food clogs arteries and gives us heart attacks?
There are dangers all around us. Unfortunately, we cannot get rid of them all.
But there are actions we can take to reduce the amount of second-hand smoke we inhale. One is to not have ash trays outside building doors (see VonKleinSmid Center). This is common sense, yet university officials have not implemented this.
Smoking is a personal choice. The First Amendment guarantees anyone the right to smoke, even if it kills them. USC should not infringe on our personal freedoms.
 
Juve J. Cortes
Ph.D. political science
“The First Amendment guarantees anyone the right to smoke, . . . .”
Mr. Cortes should have checked with someone in the USC law school before making this demonstratively incorrect statement.  Or, at the least, re-read the First Amendment.
More importantly, how old is this letter? Why is the Trojan running letters in response to articles published in April?
FACT CHECK: The Undergraduate Student Government has not yet passed a resolution regarding USC Smoking Policy.
We cordially invite you to attend our “Smoke Free Forum” on Wednesday, September 21 at 7pm in THH102 to discuss this issue with key administrators. Free food will be provided.
Questions? Email the Director of Campus Affairs at jared.ginsburg@usc.edu
Jay,
   Because banning things because they harm only you is the mark of an overbearing state. I don’t want to get all J.S.Mill on you, but if I want to drink alcohol, I will. If I want to smoke outside, that should be my right. and if I want to eat Panda express- Lord, forgive me- you shouldn’t stop me. In a community we need to respect difference, not use the power of elected bodies to force a minority to bow to the aesthetic preferences of the majority. The state doesn’t do nearly enough in many areas- from providing health information to assiting the victims of environmentally-induced disadvantage. Forcing grown adults to curtail activities that barely affect others is not something it should be doing.
Eating Panda Express doesn’t harm anyone else, though. You’re exercising your right to eat whatever you want – it’s your body, your choice. Personally, I think fast-food bans do fall under government meddling.
But if you choose to smoke, you may be within your own rights to do whatever you want to your own body and your own health, but you’re infringing on every single passerby’s right to his/her health.
This isn’t purely a question of a “nanny state” but rather about protecting everyone – and not just the smoker’s – rights. An extreme example: a murderer might be exercising his right to destroy his own future, but by killing others, he is stepping on his victim’s right to life.
This isn’t about “aesthetic preferences;” this is about individual rights to health. It isn’t a battle between the state versus the individual’s rights but over rights vs. rights.
One person eating panda express does harm others.
Do children not eat the same foods their parents eat? If a parent has Orange chicken for lunch, his/her kid will probably eat the same thing that day. 
 Does the kid not have the right to something healthier? yes. 
so in this case, what should we do? Whose rights prevail? Should we ban the parent from eating unhealthy food so his/her child might grow up healthier?
I agree that you do bring up an interesting problem. Unrelated to smoking, though, since perfect strangers are harmed by smoking, whereas in your example, children are the victims.
The reason why there’s such a difference is because children’s rights are kind of tricky. Children are technically not “legal persons” until they’re 18, and their medical and health-related decisions are made for them by their parents. For example, they can opt out of a medical procedure, but they cannot agree to a procedure without parental consent.
So, with this in mind, it would make more legal sense not to ban fast-food, but to be able to charge parents for neglect if they have extremely obese children.
“Forcing grown adults to curtail activities that barely affect others is not something it should be doing.”
Smoking is a leading cause of many health issues beyond cancer, including cardiovascular disease. The carelessness of this particular lifestyle affects many people. It affects you. It affects the people AROUND you. And it affects the costs to the health system. If you think that smoking barely affects others, do some research into the costs of smoking and its related health consequences on the health system and you’ll understand why our health system is broken.
“Why not direct our efforts to reduce breast cancer, prostate cancer or leukemia, the three most common cancers among women, men and children respectively?” — Ummmm, because smoking is a preventable behavior as opposed to environmentally-triggered, genetically predisposed cancers? Smoking doesn’t just cause cancer. It increases risk for a number of health problems (cardiovascular disease, stroke, respiratory diseases).
“If we ban smoking today, where does it end? What will we ban tomorrow?” Isn’t that a logical fallacy? Well, if we allow same sex marriage, soon people will want to marry their dogs, their first cousins, oh dear god!! (note sarcasm)
“why not ban Carl’s Jr. from campus? Or Panda Express? Or any of the other restaurants whose food clogs arteries and gives us heart attacks?” — that’s a good question. why not ban fast food from our cafeterias? I hate that stuff. And the healthy stuff is so expensive. You might be on to something. Like a moratorium preventing more fast food chains from being established on Figueroa.
Agreed.
To Jay:
you seem to be troubled. I completely agree that people should not do things that harm them. But I agree more with having the right to do whatever we want. If people want to drink, or smoke, let them. What gives y-o-u  the right to to tell others what to do? Do you think of yourself as above others, in a position to give orders? 
Up to 85 percent of people die with some sort of cancer in them (although it might not be the cause of death). Almost everything releases radioactivity. If you think that forcing your views on other decreases their probability of diseases, think again. 
For example, the very fact that you eat means that you are prone to cancer (all living things, including vegetables, contain carbon and once in a while you eat a special carbon called carbon 14, a radioactive variant. 
Can you prevent cancer from carbon-14? yes. How? Don’t eat.
So, in an attempt to decrease the probability of y-o-u acquiring cancer, I propose (I demand) you don’t eat. You might get cancer. This is for your own good. You’ll thank me later

There is no right to do whatever we want. That’s called anarchy.
so what rights do we have? the right to impose a certain lifestyle on others? it sounds like you have authoritarian tendencies.

The New York Times has come out with yet another sweeping catchphrase to characterize our generation of college-aged students and recent graduates. This time, we are supposedly proud members of “Generation Limbo,” according to a recent article.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The constituents of Generation Limbo are said to be stuck in the transition from students to working professionals. The economic downturn coupled with bleak signs of an impending recovery have caused record unemployment rates for recent college graduates. Often, graduates resort to low-skilled, part-time jobs for which they are far overqualified just to pay the bills. Some even return to their parents’ homes. These realities exist seemingly independent of a student’s alma mater.
Generation Limbo, however, is an invalid term for current undergraduate students. We mustn’t allow the unhealthy economy limit our potential for success. By taking a proactive approach during college to life after it, students will be able to evade this “limbo” term from defining their generation.
The Times’s article is littered with anecdotes of Ivy League graduates forced to wait tables for below-minimum wage, rudely shoved into a reality a far cry from the cozy American dream of attending an elite college and being set for life. Some graduates attempt a new career path altogether while others return for graduate school to wait out the lingering effects of this recession.
Within top universities, the mentality generally centers around a “welcome, you’ve made it to the old boys’ club” message where admittance guarantees a student’s future success — regardless of his or her personal efforts in college. From the very first freshman orientation featuring a professor crowing about the newest exclusive group of hand-picked students to the closing speech of a senior’s graduation ceremony, the message is one of elite privilege and coddling. Just because you get a piece of paper with the USC emblem on it, doesn’t guarantee success from here on out.
Yes, USC is one of the top universities in the country, with a rapidly climbing national reputation. But it is easy to get passive and complacent, which is exactly what the Times is accusing this generation of doing. By taking advantage of all the opportunities the university affords to the student body, students will be on the path toward a positive career.
As expected, this breeds a formula for passivity and complacency buffered by the knowledge that the university will rally behind the student now that he or she is one of its own. Instead of under-utilizing their resources, students over-rely on the brand name of the university to get a job upon graduation.
Now that it has skyrocketed in college rankings in the past few years, USC really has become one of the top-tier universities in which roughly nine applicants vie for every one seat in the incoming freshman class. USC students are keenly vulnerable to this elitist mentality as well, and should take care to avoid it at the risk for a very dangerous sense of complacency.
After all, USC provides many valuable resources, from basic education and training to advising services and networking events, which employees look for when hiring for highly coveted positions.
But USC does not spoon-feed its students. USC will not give students jobs and hand out readily-available positions at Apple, Deloitte or Disney like candy. As students, we must forge our own paths instead of relying on a simple degree for an assured future career. We are not forced into “limbo,” as the new moniker implies. It is by our actions as students of USC, undergraduate or graduate, that we can determine our successes.
The currently feeble state of the United States economy may pose a thorny problem for our goals, but students can mitigate the effects through hard work and making the most of USC’s resources. In fact, it should provide even more incentive for students to subscribe to the career center or internship newsletter, to attend more professional events organized by each school, to spruce up their résumés and leave a few at the career fair.

While we’re at school, we’re encouraged to view all fields as equal. Recruiters, however, see things a little differently.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
The importance of computer science is hard to ignore. It’s the discipline that runs our beloved phones and laptops. It’s the study that allows us to tell hundreds of people what we did last weekend and, above all, it’s a study that nearly serves as the backbone of our culture.
It’s also the reason many humanities and social science majors might not get jobs this year — and I’m speaking as a communication major who hasn’t touched math since my junior year of high school.
USC claims to offer education for the 21st century. In many ways, it fulfills that promise, but there is always room for improvement.
In the name of diversifying our education and preparing us for  careers, the university should allow undergraduates outside of the computer science program to fulfill the language requirement with a programming language.
According to CareerOneStop.com, a website sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, the fastest growing occupations for college graduates require a high level of technological competence. Computer software engineering is featured twice in the top-10 list.
Students with other interests can’t ignore this trend, as more and more jobs outside of engineering are asking for tech skills. Sure, most of us know how to create a decent document on Microsoft Word, but having a basic grasp of programming is even better. Freelance artists and writers regularly maintain their own websites; savvy marketers make their flyers email-friendly;  creative entrepreneurs use programming to tap into the application market.
What’s more, according to the USC Center for Communication Leadership and Policy, jobs are flowing from big to small companies. In start-ups, employees must dip their hands into a variety of  tasks. Having a broad range of commonly needed skills — programming among them — is just as good as being brilliant at a few specific things. For entry-level applicants, it’s often better. Even corporate employees climb the ladder more effectively when they can use a common language with the folk in information technology.
Of course, USC doesn’t just spit out employable 20-somethings. Students come here to broaden their horizons and learn how to think. Learning Spanish or Japanese isn’t just about gaining a new skill. It’s also about understanding grammar and linguistics, however grudgingly.
But who says programming languages don’t do the same things?
First, anyone who thinks that programming languages have nothing to do with grammar should open a dictionary. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, grammar is “a set of actual or presumed prescriptive notions about correct use of a language.” Any consistent language has everything to do with grammar, no matter what purpose the language serves.
It was the linguist Noam Chomsky  who developed the grammatical system that forms the backbone of modern programming. Students who take programming as a foreign language would gain a fresh perspective.
Second, programming languages have plenty of international relevance. If you were to take a trip to Paris, you’d look insane trying to ask for directions in C++, but cross-cultural collaboration happens every day in the form of software.
Programming languages are universal in a way  English isn’t. Because programming languages are new and rather specific, we don’t learn them as babies. There’s no such thing as a native speaker of C++ or Java — people from all over the world start at the same point. The country you’re from doesn’t matter, but your study of the language does. It’s a very egalitarian way to learn.
Allowing students to take programming as a foreign language isn’t about forcing anyone to do anything. It’s about looking at language in a new and modern way; it’s about expanding dialogue between the college and engineering students; it’s about giving students more options.

Wednesday marks the 296th straight day of wildfires blazing across Texas. Approximately 181 fires have burned throughout the state this week, torching more than 120,000 acres and 1,000 homes.
Record-setting drought and humidity in the state has formed ideal conditions for the raging wildfires, enlisting 2,000 firefighters in an attempt to stop them. The fires have taken the lives of at least four people, including a mother and her 18-month-old child. Four fighters have been hospitalized for heat exhaustion after working the Magnolia fire.
The largest fire occurring in Bastrop country spreads across 30,000 acres, making it the largest fire in Texas’ history. Located near Austin, the Bastrop fire has destroyed 600 homes and forced 5,000 residents to evacuate. As of Wednesday, it was deemed 30 percent contained, in which firefighters claimed their goal was to save as many structures as possible.
The Texas Task Force 1, an elite search team that was sent to New York on September 11 and to New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, will now help search for people trapped under debris in the Bastrop County fire through the use of canines.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has had to return from a presidential campaign trip in South Carolina in order to deal with the crisis. Seven federal grants were approved by the Obama administration to assist with relief efforts.
Since the start of the wildfire season in November, 3.5 million acres, an area about the size of Connecticut, has burned through Texas. Though some fires have lessened, firefighters continue to battle the 181 fires throughout the state.

It’s been more than 10 years since the East Great Falls class of 1999 walked the halls together and nearly a decade since the last movie, American Wedding, hit theaters. Now the original cast of American Pie is coming together for a good ol’ fashioned high school reunion.
Set to be released in April 2012, American Reunion reunites the gang we grew to love, apple pie and all. Despite being under a different director and screenwriter from the original, audiences will still be able to recognize the on-screen faces.
Jason Biggs returns as awkward Jim Levenstein, who is married to Michelle, played by Allyson Hannigan. Chris Klein and Mena Suvari will reprise their roles as Oz and Heather, respectively. Thomas Ian Nicholas will revisit the role of Kevin, and Tara Reid that of Vicky.
Last but not least, we can’t forget Seann William Scott as the ever-so-obnoxious Stifler and Eddie Kaye Thomas as his rival, Finch.
Though the boys of the group will obviously no longer be seeking to lose their precious virginity, the synopsis on the movie’s website promises to revive memorable traits that define some of the characters. For instance, MILF-seeking Finch will still be after Stifler’s mother, reprised by Jennifer Coolidge.
In recent years, some of the cast members have moved on to other projects (you can catch Hannigan on How I Met Your Mother), so it’s understandable if you worry the humor has vanished with the hormone-raging teenage years. But Scott quells our anxieties in a recent interview with People magazine, stating, “In many respects we’ve grown up a lot. But on the other hand, we haven’t grown up at all.”
So whip out your American Pie quotes and “get ready for one last slice.” A teaser trailer of American Reunion can be found at americanreunionmovie.com.

Every so often a motion picture, video short or ad campaign successfully combines audio and visual to create an awe-inspiring product. Chipotle has recently been added to that list of successful endeavors.
The franchise, collaborating with Willie Nelson, has released a two-minute advertisement supporting sustainable farming in today’s agribusiness world. While the environmental message comes across as harsh, it was executed in a creative way and it makes a point worth considering.
In the ad, set for release in theaters later this month, Nelson covers one of Coldplay’s most successful songs, “The Scientist.” The track itself questions modern science  — how far is too far? When should we stop pushing boundaries?
The video begins with a small-town farmer realizing he has the opportunity to increase his profits exponentially. So, in come the changes. He builds pigpen, towering silos and leads the pigs into a massive machine that cuts them into cubes. Nelson’s wavering vocals over the politically charged track highlight the severity of the campaign.
After wandering the countryside late at night as Nelson trembles “Nobody said it was easy…,” the farmer decides to ditch the profits and go back to sustainable farming. “I’m going back to the start,” Nelson croons as the farmer physically overturns pens, barren fields and big buildings.
The track is a nice take on a classic. The song has the recognizable crescendo to the end of the ad, but it’s really Nelson’s vocals that shine here. There is a level of humility before science, but also honesty for something you can tell the singer believes in fighting for.
The advertisement showcases music performance at its finest.
Nelson’s rendition of “The Scientist” is currently available for purchase on iTunes.

“Let’s give the Conference’s two newest members a good, old-fashioned, All-American welcome!” begins Bob Oschack’s September 2 clip on Fox Sports.
In a distasteful segment aired Sept. 2, Fox Sports “welcomed” Colorado and Utah to the newly formed PAC-12. The video, which aired on their Sports homepage and was quickly added to YouTube and Hulu, featured comedian-turned-reporter Bob Oschack interviewing numerous USC students on campus — all of whom were Asian-American.
The three-minute clip shows Oschack deliberately misunderstanding the students’ accents, asking them what they know about USC’s football program, and then poking fun at their lack of knowledge.
Fox Sports was quick to remove the video from its various servers as soon as the complaints started rolling in. The video, which was called a “flagrant racial caricature” by deadspin.com, caused a small commotion during the time it was online. In return, head of media relations Lou D’Ermillo issued an official statement to “the entire USC community” apologizing for the breakdown in editorial professionalism.
Critics say the video mocks Asian-Americans, singling them out and making them seem un-American. In one segment, Oschack responds to a student’s enthusiastic “Welcome to Colorado and Utah!” with a condescending, “No, you’re saying welcome to Colorado and Utah. We’re in Los Angeles.”
The clip is unsettlingly racist, especially considering that USC is such an ethnically and culturally diverse school. Though Fox Sports apologized profusely for the video, something like this should never have left the drawing board.
The full news story can be found at http://deadspin.com/5837054/fox-sports-does-humiliating-whiteface-routine.
This story is chock full of ironies. (Columbia Journalism Review posted a comment and the video). Strangely, nobody bothered to examine admissions standards at USC. Out of delicacy, I will not yet call those practices racist. 
SAT English is atrocious. TOEFL English is an embarrassment. USC should cooperate with American, Australian, and UK universities to establish an accurate world admissions curriculum for learners of English. 
If I say “I talk…talk about what?” then I am a victim of silly English teaching and testing (the default English “curriculum” in many countries is IELTS or TOEFL). There is a powerful way to teach ESL at this level: reading out loud from the Penguin Kipling’s “Kim” (Edward Said) and the Penguin Kipling “Selected Stories,” ed. Andrew Rutherford. Searching words and grammar  in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Absorbing the COBUILD Intermediate English Grammar. Columbia might be the best university to teach these texts to Asia via distance education. 
Yale, since it has some experience in Internet education, might be effective in teaching an advanced English learner’s course with the COBUILD English Grammar, the Arden “Hamlet,” “The Turn of the Screw,” “Heart of Darkness,” and the poems of Emily Dickinson. 
The USC admissions procedures for international students, whether intentional or not, are deeply racist. They are paternalistic and absurd. They expose the cognitive limitations of the admissions people. (If you want focus on cognition so as to help design English language systems for international students, you could assimilate Mark Ashcraft’s great text “Cognition”).
Fox, ironically, is part of the company that owns COBUILD. Instead of posting racist video, Fox could reveal the depredations of TOEFL English and promote COBUILD. English is the Exxon Mobil or Walmart of languages. The massive gravitational attraction of ETS, Kaplan, TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, and ACT costs students the opportunity to learn. The opportunity costs of English are those of a virtual predatory corporation larger than Walmart. 
Now, it would be possible for admissions at USC to ask questions about my post. Instead of going to ground or hiding in a cardboard box.

A mere 10-minute drive from USC lies the Road to Seoul in Koreatown. Though the restaurant’s name would have you prepped for an epic journey as you walk through their front doors, the Road to Seoul relies more on service than atmosphere to bring its patrons the best Korean BBQ around.
Korean BBQ, for those unacquainted, is the method by which various types of raw meats are ordered and cooked right in front of consumers at their respective tables. One of the more interesting aspects of this dining experience is the involvement patrons have in preparing their own food.
At Road to Seoul, diners select meats and, using built in table grills, cook the food to their own specifications. With an all you can eat, ‘buffet’ style setup, patrons pay an initial flat rate for as much food their stomachs desire. Common dishes include marinated bulgogi {beef}, pork, chicken and brisket.
There are also a few seafood options like baby octopus, shrimp and squid. Since the final product of flavor and overall satisfaction is tailored to each individual and how one chooses to prepare their meal, waitstaff and service is a crucial part of the Korean BBQ experience.
Nonetheless, not everything at Road to Seoul requires diners to cook it themselves. Delicious beachu kimchi {spiced cabbage}, savory gamjajeon {thin pancakes} and filling sticky rice were always in rotation.
Road to Seoul’s staff are helpful and very accommodating, especially in detailing more information about Korean BBQ to first time visitors. Waiters frequently change out table grills to ensure clean equipment and even take pictures of patrons who wanted a keepsake for their night out on the town.
If you are looking for a great go-to restaurant for Korean BBQ or are itching for an adventurous introduction to a new style of cuisine, Road to Seoul is the place for you.

A bill to expedite legal hurdles for creating a new Los Angeles football stadium passed two California State Assembly committees and has been submitted to the legislative floor on Wednesday.
The California Assembly has four days to vote on the bill on the proposed $1.2 billion downtown stadium by Anschutz Entertainment Group. Environmental groups, however, have expressed concern that the bill will allow the project to bypass crucial environmental standards.
“I think it’s more important that we get it done right than we get it done fast,” Sen. Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto), chairman of the chamber’s Environmental Quality Committee, told the Los Angeles Times.
But, two other environmental groups that originally opposed the bill expressed their approval Tuesday. The National Resources Defense Council and the California League of Conservation Voters supported AEG’s plan to make the stadium carbon-neutral and encourage more public transportation.
California Assembly Speaker John Perez, who supports and submitted the bill, said the project factors in environmental concerns and processes while also creating jobs.
“It was very important to me that this project and our legislation gain the support of such well-respected environmental champions,” Speaker Pérez told NBC.
If the bill passes the assembly, it must still go to the state senate and be signed by Gov. Jerry Brown. The proposed stadium would be built next to the Staples Center downtown.

After lifting the social ban on The Row on Friday, Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said the first weekend without the social ban went relatively well, despite an incident Friday night.
Party · A female student fell off an outdoor staircase at the Sigma Chi Fraternity Friday night. The incident should not affect Student Affairs ending the social ban. - Kevin Nguyen | Daily Trojan
A female student fell one story onto concrete from an outdoor staircase at the Sigma Chi Fraternity at 6:30 p.m. Friday and was transported to the hospital unconscious but still breathing. Jackson said her condition was stable as of Tuesday.
He said Student Affairs’ investigation of the incident only concerns Sigma Chi.
“We don’t know the full circumstances under which [she] slipped, and believe that it was a small social gathering,” Jackson said. “We’re still trying to ascertain what happened. Of course, our first thoughts go to her and her family.”
Student Affairs will make sure Sigma Chi acted appropriately before and after the incident, and expects to resolve the matter by the end of the week. He said other fraternities had no problems this weekend.
“As far as I can tell, everyone else did what they were supposed to do this weekend,” Jackson said. “It’s ironic that this occurred on the same day that the ban was lifted, but you can’t predict when things will happen.”
The implementation of recommendations from the Greek Task Force, created last year when the social ban began, allowed Jackson to end the ban. The Interfraternity Council also voted to have a dry pre-rush, which Jackson said was successful.
Jackson said working with students to make the Greek community safe is an ongoing process.
“Most of the fraternities and sororities are works in progress,” Jackson said. “We’re always working with new leadership to constantly improve the community.”
The Greek Task Force has implemented two of four objectives. First, they had 250 members of Greek executive boards attend a meeting Aug. 19 with the Dept. of Public Safety about holding large events safely.
“They did an awesome job,” said IFC President Pat Lauer. “We became educated on what to do to keep people safe and how to have big social events in a safe environment.”
Lauer said there are plans for the event to occur annually.
The Greek community is also in the process of creating a Greek Judicial Board for all councils.
Lauer said the council would address incidents like those that occurred last spring.
“Each council has their own ways of dealing with judicial matters,” Lauer said. “This board will be to handle high profile cases that affect the entire Greek community.”
An all-council new-member education program will be also held in coordination with the Office of Student Affairs in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Sept. 18 from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. New sorority and fraternity members will attend two-hour-long workshops and listen to speakers talk about alcohol and pledging.
“The whole idea is to educate new members of the Greek community,” Lauer said. “It’ll be a time for the community to become familiar with [Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards] and meet DPS so they can get an understanding of how the Greek community is run.”
Ayushi Gummadi, president of the Panhellenic Council, said the goal of the event is to spark a change in Greek culture and prevent dangerous situations, like the drinking that sent some students to the hospital at the beginning of last year.
“Given everything that happened last fall, the idea is to create a culture change,” Gummadi said. “This is something we hope becomes a tradition every year with new members. We’re offering these kinds of education and resources from the beginning in order to create a culture change.”
Risk management teams in each fraternity and sorority house have also worked to establish better communication with law enforcement and review incident protocol.
“We’ve been extra cautious about trying to play by the rules,” Lauer said. “We want to have events in an atmosphere that’s both safe and fun.”
Lauer also said IFC specifically spearheaded a Greek Liaison Program this year where a DPS officer is assigned as a specific point of contact for  small groups of houses.
“We’re going to really stress that they meet up regularly and that everyone is in the loop,” Lauer said. “We need to prove that we monitor ourselves and self-govern. This was spotty in the past and there was sometimes an ‘us vs. them’ mentality.”
DPS Chief Carey Drayton said the Greek system’s relationship with DPS is better than most.
“I would stack our relationship with the Greek community with any law enforcement relationship,” Drayton said. “Fraternities asked us to come to their meetings last week. That doesn’t happen in a lot of places.”
Lauer said the IFC is now communicating continuously with DPS.
“All the fraternities are on the same page,” Lauer said. “We’ve all tried really hard to stop our members from doing things that could jeopardize the entire community.”
Andy Winningham, a member of Phi Delta Theta and a senior majoring in business administration, said the communication between enforcement and the Greek community will run more smoothly.
“The Row will just be more fine tuned now that we see the heightened importance of it,” Winningham said. “After what happened last year, houses really had to crack down on risk management.”
Gummadi said that PHC has also seen good things on The Row this weekend.
“All the presidents have been extremely collaborative and everyone’s been respectful of the rules we have in place,” Gummadi said. “We’re looking forward to further collaboration with the university and making this the best year possible.”
Lauer said IFC’s priority is to prove that it has earned the right to monitor itself.
“The biggest thing is to prove that we can self-govern now that the social ban has been lifted,” Lauer said. “We want to avoid any problems like the ones we had last year.”
Where did Dr. Jackson get his doctorate and in what area of study? Clearly his background excludes any form of practical study in higher education and/or psychology. “You can’t predict when things will happen.” Oh, really? Student Affairs lifts the Row probation, a young woman falls from a balcony of a frat house is taken to ER and is in “Stable” condition, and the good Doctor seems to attribute all this to coincidence.
As a third generation alumnus of the University of Southern California, I am aware not only of the length of Dr. Jackson’s tenure as Vice President for Student Affairs; my fellow Trojans and I have observed as throughout that tenure Dr. Jackson has remained a pawn of the special interests that obscure and too often obfuscate the realities of “28th Street.” Maybe, just maybe, we need a new VP for Student Affairs…
Now that you can simply write a check when you get in trouble everything is much more fair.

USC announced last week it will launch phase two of its three-phase Iranian studies initiative, which will introduce a minor in Iranian Studies to create a more diverse learning experience for students.
The university is currently in the process of hiring new faculty as they look to expand the program through fundraising and individual donations.
The USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, in collaboration with the Farhang Foundation, an Iranian-American foundation in Southern California, launched the Iranian studies initiative in November 2010 by offering Persian language classes.
“This initiative was the first program of its kind at the university, aiming to add Persian language classes to the curriculum and to create a specialization in Iranian Studies at USC,” said Haleh Emrani, an associate professor of Persian and chair of the Iranian Studies Council at the Farhang Foundation.
Haleh said that familiarity with Iranian history and languages will not only provide students with a deeper understanding of world issues but will also give them insight into an ancient and rich culture.
“We truly believe this program will enrich students’ college experience and widen their worldview, while providing them with valuable skills that are high in demand in the realm of international relations and diplomacy,” Emrani said.
Kevin Van Bladel, director of the Middle East studies program at USC, said the initiative in Iranian specialization is particularly important to USC, its students and the community because there are more Iranians living in Los Angeles than in any other city outside of Iran.
“USC’s Iranian studies initiative reflects the interests of students and the community,” Van Bladel said. “The initiative is suitably timed as it coincides with another initiative, the founding of the Middle East Studies Program at USC.”
Last year USC hired its first Persian-teaching instructor, Peyman Nojoumian, associate professor of Persian studies, who began teaching this fall.
Elaine Baran, a junior majoring in sociology, said she has great interest in the Iranian Studies program and would consider taking a course next semester.
“Learning about cultures and languages outside of your own will not only give you insight into the different worlds around you, but it will also help you appreciate it,” Baran said. “I am excited that there will be a new minor offered in this field.”

Students expressed outrage that Dept. of Public Safety took 36 hours to send out a crime alert after two USC students were shot early Sunday morning outside of a party at an apartment complex at 1241 West 37th Place.

A male undergraduate student was shot in the chest and a female graduate student was shot in the hand and suffered a bloody finger, said Capt. Melissa Zak of LAPD’s Southwest Division.
Students, including those who live near the apartment complex, were angered that DPS did not send out a Trojans Alert.
“Students’ safety should come first,” said Sullivan Brown, a junior majoring in animation and digital art who lives on the 1200 block of West 37th Place. “DPS should have texted us as soon as the incident occurred, especially those people who live on the west side of campus.”
After consulting with LAPD, DPS chose not to issue a Trojans Alert because it determined the community was not in any immediate danger and the suspect was no longer at large.
“The two or maybe three suspects [involved in the incident] immediately left the scene and walked away,” DPS Chief Carey Drayton said. “It was determined that there was not an ongoing threat and people didn’t need to do anything special. We didn’t need anybody to hunker down because we had police canvassing the entire area looking for witnesses at the time.”
The shooting occurred when the suspect was accused of having stolen a pair of expensive headphones. The female victim attempted to help settle the altercation between the male victim and the suspect, according to Gueston Cordae Smith, a sophomore majoring in architecture who attended the party.
“We were dancing and having a good time, and all of a sudden the [male] victim turned on the lights and was acting really angry,” Smith said. “[The male victim] said that his headphones were stolen … and then walked up to the shooter.”
In response to the accusation, the suspect pulled out a handgun and fired a round at the victims going through the female victim’s hand before hitting the male victim’s chest, according to Sgt. Will Smith of LAPD’s Southwest division.
“An argument came up and, not even a minute later, the [shooter] pulled out a gun,” Gueston Cordae Smith said. “I saw that gun in his hand, so I grabbed two of the girls who were with me and just ran out. As soon as I was running down the hall, I heard a gunshot.”
If the bullet had not first gone through the female victim’s hand, the bullet probably would have killed the male victim, Zak said.
Both victims were immediately taken to California Hospital Medical Center, where the male victim was listed in critical but stable condition and underwent surgery Sunday morning, Sgt. Smith said.
The female victim is in “OK” condition, according to the Dept. of Public Safety on Sunday. She underwent surgery Sunday night on her hand, Zak said.
Both victims are expected to make a full recovery, said Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson.
The suspect is a black male who is believed to be 6-foot-3 and weigh 180 pounds. He is also described as having protruding front teeth, a tattoo across his chest with a cross and unidentifiable tattoos on his biceps.
Students were also concerned that DPS did not send out a Crime Alert until 36 hours after the incident occurred.
Under the Clery Act, passed in 2007 in wake of the Virginia Tech shooting, universities are required to issue Crime Alerts when the community should be aware of a crime or crimes that have occurred in a specific geographic location. The Crime Alert is also required to provide tips to prevent members of the community from being victimized by the suspect or suspects.
DPS decided not to release a Crime Alert until it had a more accurate description of the suspect to ensure that people were not incorrectly profiled as a suspect. They also needed permission from LAPD and the FBI to release more specific details regarding the shooting.
“A Crime Alert was not issued right away because we have found in the past that non-specific descriptions can be offensive to groups of people because they inappropriately become suspects,” Drayton said. “The delay in the Crime Alert was a delay to get the right information, a more laser-focused description, and the approval of [LAPD and the FBI] to release more specifics.”
In the coming weeks DPS will review its process of informing members of the community about crimes in the area, Drayton said.
“There needs to be a real conversation between students, faculty, parents and staff about the insatiable desire to receive news and the legal requirements and obligations [DPS has] to protect the community,” Drayton said.
Police interviewed witnesses at the party and have begun searching for the suspect. Police performed a comprehensive search of the premises Sunday afternoon and found the headphones in question.
An investigation into the shooting includes members of LAPD, DPS, the FBI and members of the South Bureau’s Criminal Gang/Homicide Division, according to Sgt. Smith.
Although the handgun has not  been found, LAPD is currently following several solid leads, Zak said.
Here’s the problem:
“A Crime Alert was not issued right away because we have found in the past that non-specific descriptions can be offensive to groups of people because they inappropriately become suspects,” 
So it was political correctness that prevented a Trojan Alert?  The African population surrounding USC needs to be afraid of DPS, NOT the other way around.  This has to be Carey Drayton’s last month of employment at USC.
This comment sounds like it could have been made in Birmingham in the 1960s. You should be really proud of yourself.
Why are students living in an area west of campus well known for its unsafe neighborhoods? We’re talking drive by shootings type of neighbohoods.
The reason is simple, while USC has quickly increased the size of its student body-in one year alone, we went from 32k or so students to 38k or so this year–AN INCREASE OF OVER 20%, the university has failed to offer the proper and necessary infrastructure to support this massive increase in students. Instead of taking responsiblity for our students, the Administration: Max Nikias, has allowed outside investors to build apts in choice areas(University Gateway, Tuscany, West 27th) that pamper few students while the less well-healed are  are forced to move into areas where they have no business living: west of Vermont.
Where is Max Nikias during all of this? He is off on a Chinese junket wooing a government and its institutions that hang common criminals, put dissentors in jail, censor citizens’ rights to the freedoms we all cherish, and don’t seem to hold dear the same values that define us as a nation. A dubious partner to say the least. Yet, Max is determined to make them an integral part of USC. Really?
Why is Max off in China instead of minding the school he is in charge of? MONEY, of course. The same reason he admits 6K new students this year without providing for them–tuition Money. More students equals much more money to spend on increasing the prestige of USC. But, before we do this, let’s consider the source of this money and above all, let’s take care of all of our students and provide safe places to eat , study, and sleep–this is a basic right–that USC seems to be failing miserably at. Come home, Max. We need you more than the Chinese do.
I live in the building where this happened.  I was away when it occurred and had to hear about it the next morning via a text from my roommate, then looked it up on the news.  Honestly, I’m not too upset with DPS.  I think the guys were stupid to present such a blatant opportunity for crime, getting wasted and letting tons of people wander in and out of our building, which is normally pretty secure.  It’s also the nicest on the block and I know that it was an easy target.  USC’s late response made me a little ticked off, but let’s be honest, non-university housing is not their responsibility, the students are.  They do a lot to prevent crime in this neighborhood.  I’m more upset with my building’s management, Stuho Housing, for not notifying us, talking to us, putting up any signs, increasing any security, and basically acting like this didn’t happen.  In fact when I returned from my trip on Monday, our gate was wide open because it broke (probably from all the commotion with the news crews and stuff).  Don’t go Stuho!  They’re totally incompetent.  I’d move if someone getting shot was a valid excuse to break a lease in their eyes.
I think there are plenty of areas in which DPS could improve, but I fail to see why students are “outraged” by the department’s response to this particular incident.  I completely agree with the decision not to issue a Trojan Alert for the shooting.  What good would it have done?  There’s no evidence to suggest that this shooter was on some sort of wider rampage.  He wanted to steal from some students, they resisted, and the shooter responded out of anger.  Everything suggests that this was an isolated incident.  Sending out a Trojan Alert saying something along the lines of, “There was a shooting off campus.  Someone with a gun may still be in the vicinity,” would only cause mass panic.  There are plenty of potentially dangerous people in these neighborhoods (as with all big cities).  And, I’d be willing to bet that this shooter isn’t the first person to carry a gun nearby campus.  Students should always exercise caution and common sense, even when not directed to by a Trojan Alert.  
In the case of Virginia Tech, there was a shooter going through campus with a mission to kill students, forcing them to take extraordinary preventative measures (i.e. lock yourself in a room or flee from campus).  The Cleary Act was meant to help alert students that they needed to take unusual protective steps by providing them with the necessary intel.  The most recent USC shooting didn’t require any monumental action from students other than what they’re supposed to do every day: be safe, don’t fight with thieves, don’t let strangers into your house, etc.  
So many students like to think that they’re adults now.  Well, most adult communities don’t have a text alert system to direct your attention to every potential threat.  We’re all smart people, and I think we should make a little more effort to be safety smart as well.  What happened to these students is tragic, and we should look to our entire community (not just DPS) to prevent something like this from happening again.
It’d be nice if we knew why the hell FBI is involved. Any speculations, DT?
DPS&USC Fail, again!!!
USC’s 2010 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report provides, in part, as follows:
USC shall make timely reports to the campus community as required by the Clery Act on crimes considered a serious or continuing threat to students or employees in the judgment of the Chief of Public Safety…The warning will be issued through any means appropriate, including the university email system, emergency notification system, posted fliers, or on the DPS website http://capsnet.usc.edu/DPS
A SERIOUS and continuing THREAT existed when multiple suspects FLED the scene of a VIOLENT crime in which two students were SHOT.  
USC’s Chief of Public Safety, Carey Drayton, must be held to account for his serious lapse of judgment!
Stuart,
You are confusing Crime Alerts and Trojans Alerts.  A Trojans Alert is the one that goes out via text when there is an immediate threat.  Police got there and found the suspects were not anywhere in the area, so no immediate threat.  A Crime Alert is what they send out via e-mail to comply with the Cleary Act.  The article states one was sent out as soon as USC was authorized to put decent suspect info in there.
I guess I’m missing something here… To echo Stuart’s point, how is it that someone shoots 2 USC students and because when the police arrive the suspect has fled the crime scene, there is “no immediate threat”?   If they got there, disarmed and cuffed him, there’s no threat.  The fact that this person could have broken into a nearby apartment to hide out seems somewhat threatening to me.  With all due respect, while you may know the difference between Crime Alerts and Trojan Alerts, there seems to be a disconnect between common scence and covering ones posterior.  I personally would want to know that someone was shot a block away when I hear someone knocking on my door to deliver an unordered pizza at 2am.
Sure, he could have broken into an apartment.  He also could have gone straight to LAX and bought a ticket to Moscow.  Police searched the area and didn’t find any evidence he was still in the area.  Nor did they find any broken down doors as far as we know.  No additional incidents occurred, so it looks like the police made the right call that it was safe after they got there.
I hope you were not planning on opening the door at 2am for someone you don’t know regardless where you live.  Whether or not you were aware of a crime down the road, I would hope you would use that common sense.
Knows the Difference:  Don’t complicate or confuse the issue.  The Clery Act requires that institutions provide students and employees with timely warnings of crimes that represent a threat to their safety.  They knew full well that when they drafted the Clery Act that any crime alert would be deficient and that students and their parents might be anxious or terrified.  Nevertheless, they enacted the policy and once again, USC failed to make a notification in a timely manner.
To voice out your concern….Concerned Parent….. After my first year here it was clear to see that most of these “criminals” intent is to get any little thing out of the students but NOT to harm them. USC is not just another university, it is a community within a community. Many of these “criminals” know their in and outs of it and USC staff knows that.   What else could have been done? This guy who fled was not going to go stab someone else or wait around for another victim. I haven’t heard of them doing that before?!
If you pay attention, most of the Tragic accidents are self inflicted and others could have been prevented by the student alone. There is so much we can do if we work together but instead we choose to fight.
I came here to learn and be challenged by the amazing faculty. I have loved every minute of it and I am enjoying all the great events USC has to offer. My parents taught me to be a responsible individual. A responsible UNIVERSITY student and I don’t expect any different from any of my classmates. If your child cannot handle any “peer pressure” than I think that students is not mentally prepared to be here.
Thanks for clarifying this.
These ‘open community’ parties will never end. Many of these crimes can be prevented, but hey! What college student doesn’t get f@3ed up!, or walk alone through isolated areas when there are other options etc. Let’s keep pointing fingers and see how much this will help solve the core of these problems. 
As a student, I’m ashamed to see students my age and older act a fool! with hardly any common sense! Lets see how many young men/ladies will wake up naked, overdosed and doing the walk of shame. Lets see how many of them and their parents will start blaming others instead of taking responsibility for their own actions! 
I have seen the hard work and dedication of all these “babysiting” departments. It’s a lot of work. 
College years can be so memorable…. and yet we decide to make them a traumatic experience.
As a concerned parent of a USC student who lives in the area of this shooting, I am outraged by failure of  USC authorities to issue a Trojan Alert in accordance with the provisions of the Cleary Act.  The DPS cannot contend that a Crime Alert was unwarranted because the suspects fled the scene and it could not provide accurate descriptions of them. Simply put, suspects involved in a violent shooting of two USC students were at large in a neighborhood populated by students.  How anyone can argue that is not cause to issue a Crime Alert is completely beyond me.
Stay out of our business Stuart.  Don’t you have more important things to do then “helicopter” over campus?
@Stuart
On behalf of fraternity boys at USC who know when it’s proper to use the word “than” instead of “then”, I must apologize for the above comment and say that I agree with you completely.  I’ve read the Clery Act, and as an SC law student, I do not see how the legal obligation to provide the community with an alert is contingent on whether or not an accurate description of the suspect can be provided.  And to those who claim to know with certainty that the suspect fled the area and was no longer an immediate danger to the community (Apparently, they knew the suspect’s whereabouts, could read his mind and know his intentions?), I find that position untenable, ignorant, and very, very reckless.  Law enforcement should always err on the side of caution.  DPS is simply using that as a scapegoat to deflect criticism and a possible lawsuit for their remarkable incompetence.  How corrupt of them.
Incidentally, just last semester, I was handcuffed by DPS officers in the middle of campus two days in a row because I allegedly fit the profile of a suspect they were looking for (Apparently, the description was for a 6′ tall, blonde, white male, wearing a USC shirt and carrying a Macbook…).  After checking my identification and determining that I was not in fact who they were looking for, I was advised to AVOID CAMPUS–including not attending classes–until the suspect was apprehended in order to prevent being detained again.  THIS is the caliber of genius we are dealing with here.
How corrupt of them?… Lol what are you talking about…? I have video of hundreds of USC students rioting vs LAPD…I think the students are still good people. Don’t paint with such a large brush young man you might get some on yourself.
