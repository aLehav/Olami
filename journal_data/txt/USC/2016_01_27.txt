The men’s basketball team will look to rebound after a disappointing road trip that saw the Trojans lose back-to-back games for just the second time this season. The Men of Troy entered the road trip ranked for the first time since 2008, but the two losses have USC on the outside looking in.
The Trojans struggled mightily on the offensive end during the road trip in Oregon. USC shot an icy 39 percent from the field, while allowing Oregon and Oregon State to shoot over 48 percent. The Trojans lead the Pac-12 in made 3-point shots with 169, but were only able to convert 26 percent of their 3-point attempts during the road trip.
The Trojans are one of the youngest teams in the nation, with just one senior on the roster, which explains their struggles on the road. All five of USC’s losses have come away from home. The Trojans have already showed much more poise than in years past, but consistency will be key if USC hopes to make a legit run at the Pac-12 title.
The Washington State Cougars will make their way to the Galen Center this Thursday. The Trojans defeated the Cougars 90-77 on Jan. 1 in Pullman. Five Trojans scored in double figures, led by forward Nikola Jovanovic, who finished with 20 points on 8-12 shooting.
The Cougars have lost five straight and sit at the bottom of the Pac-12 for a second consecutive season. Junior Josh Hawkinson leads the team with averages of 14 points and 10 rebounds per game. Hawkinson was the only Cougar to have any success against the Trojans in their first matchup, finishing with 19 points and 13 rebounds on 7-12 shooting.
USC has been extremely well-balanced this season. The Trojans have five players averaging double digit scoring per game. One big reason for the uptick in offensive team production is the play of guards Julian Jacobs and Jordan McLaughlin. Jacobs is leading the Pac-12 in assists with 5.7 per game, with McLaughlin right behind him at 4.9 per game.
Both McLaughlin and Jacobs had stellar games against the Cougars in their first matchup, finishing with a combined 31 points, nine rebounds and seven assists on 61 percent shooting. Expect the backcourt duo to attack hard against a weak Cougar defense.
At first glance, defense seems to be the biggest issue for the Trojans as they give up more than 73 points per game. The Trojans are holding teams to 39 percent shooting, however, and have a net scoring margin more than 10 points, both stats good for second in the Pac-12.
Freshman Chimezie Metu has been a big reason why the Trojans have taken such a leap forward on the defensive end. The first year big man is averaging 1.7 blocks per game, good for sixth in the Pac-12 and is giving opposing teams a reason to fear attacking the rim. As a team the Trojans are averaging 6.3 blocks per game, a vast improvement over years past.
After playing five of their first seven conference games on the road, the Trojans play their next three at home. The Trojans are currently 11-0 at home this season, their best mark to start a season since going undefeated at home in 1943.
Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the Galen Center. The game will be aired on the Pac-12 Network.

Since its inaugural season in 1970, the USC men’s volleyball program has been steeped in success. Thus, it’s only fitting that when the Pac-12 All-Century team was named this week, four Trojans (setter Dusty Dvorak, middle blocker Bryan Ivie and outside hitters Celso Kalache and Pat Powers) made the 16-man roster. Men of Troy like them have created a legacy at USC that accounts for the program’s extremely high expectations year after year.
Expectations like that are part of the reason why this year’s slow start (1-6, 1-4 MPSF) has come as such a shock to the Trojan Nation.
“At no time did I ever think we would start 0-6,” first year head coach Jeff Nygaard said before Tuesday’s win over Pepperdine. “However, the improvement that we make on a daily basis is exactly what I was looking for.”
The Trojans started the season ranked No. 12 nationally but fell out of Monday’s rankings for the first time since the end of the 2013 season.
Senior libero and captain Brooks Varni is more impressed with the in-game experience his team has gained than than he is concerned with the rankings.
“I think they will settle themselves once we get toward the end of the season,” Varni said.
Despite the slow start, the team has shown confidence in Nygaard’s new program.
“We just got to trust our ability to do what we’ve been doing,” Varni said after Monday’s practice. “We’re just sticking to the routine. Our coaches are keeping their same mindset, and if we keep emulating that, it will help our team in the long run.”
The team’s patience finally paid off on Tuesday night with a five-set win over No. 8 Pepperdine. While the Trojans got off to a 2-0 lead, they had to patiently wait three more sets before they were able to close out the match.
“We’re getting better,” Nygaard said after the win. “We’re learning how to be mindful. Meaning, our emotions got away from us and we made sure to bring it in and take a deep breath.”
Nygaard expects that as the season goes on his young team will learn to control emotions better and consequently play more consistent volleyball.
“Guys tried to hit the ball far too hard and when you do that you lose the ability to actually control yourself, control the game, control what’s happening,” Nygaard said. “But hats off to the guys; they found a way to calm down, regroup, and get the win.”
The return of junior middle blocker Andy Benesh from a back injury was a big part of the team’s added composure.
Benesh brings experience, having played at the highest levels internationally this summer.
“I’ve stepped into more of a leadership role this year,” Benesh said. “I know what it takes to be successful.”
“I know there will be an experienced purveyor of decisions on the court that I can rely on,” Nygaard said of Benesh.
With the new lineup, the Trojans seem poised for a dramatic mid-season turnaround and a return to the program’s winning history.
Sophomore opposite Jon Rivera’s career performance Tuesday night (23 kills and .302 hitting) should serve as not only a testament to the team’s up-and-coming second half but also to the program’s growth at the dawn of the Nygaard era.
“There’s been a lot of changes this season for the better,” Rivera said after the win. “Believe in the process, [Nygaard] is a genius. he really knows what he’s doing.”
Nygaard has a plethora of volleyball accolades — he is a two-time NCAA National Champion and two-time National Player of the Year at UCLA (1992-1995), a two-time member of the U.S. Men’s Indoor Olympic team (1996-200), and an Olympian for the third time in 2004 in beach and indoor volleyball.
Earlier this week, Nygaard was named to the Pac-12 All-Century team, an distinction he said is indescribable.
“The individuals on that team are some of the best of the best and to be named in that group is an honor I can’t even begin to describe,” Nygaard said.
While Nygaard’s legacy as a one-of-a-kind player will remain attached to his name forever, his new mission is to take what he learned throughout his career and share that knowledge with this Trojans team.
He certainly learned the impact a coach can have on a team while playing under Pac-12 All-Century Coach Al Scates.
“The thing I learned at UCLA under [Scates]is that the the best players play,” Nygaard said. “If you earn it in practice, you go on the court.”
Nygaard believes in building winning teams around character, something he sees a lot of in his young squad.
“I can’t help but feel that once we start clicking, which I know we will, we have a chance at going undefeated the rest of the season,” Nygaard said. “We legitimately have that capability. Is it going to be easy? No, but we have that capability.”
Can we NOT refer to ourselves as Trojan “Nation” please. We’re not the Raiders. It is, has been, and always will be the Trojan Family.

Media frenzy · USC Village, which will open next fall, is one of many facilities that will be used by the media if Los Angeles succeeds in its bid for the Olympics in 2024. Construction on The Village began in 2014. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Los Angeles 2024 announced earlier this week that it has selected the University Park Campus as its Media Village, which would house members of the media, officials and stakeholders during the Games should the city be given the nod to host. The newly publicized plan also includes UCLA’s campus becoming the home of the Olympic Village, where all athletes and team officials would be lodged in its residential facilities.
Without USC, Los Angeles’s bid would be incomplete. The money the university is putting into projects including the USC Village and the Coliseum further strengthens their bid, and it only helps that the surrounding area will also be fully developed.
It’s nice to see the two crosstown rivals team up every once in a while for a greater cause, and both schools will undoubtedly play a tremendous role should the Games be awarded to L.A. when the International Olympic Committee votes in September 2017. With downtown Los Angeles expected to be presented as the unofficial epicenter of the Games themselves, though, the spotlight would focus more on and around USC, not UCLA, and rightfully so.
USC boasts a rich Olympic history. The University Park campus housed athletes during the 1984 Games and the school has produced over 400 Olympians and almost 300 Olympic Medals. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is controlled and operated by USC, served as the site of the opening and closing ceremonies at both the 1932 and 1984 Games. The iconic venue, which also previously hosted athletics events in the Games, is located right in the heart of Exposition Park, adjacent to USC. Perhaps most importantly, the Coliseum is scheduled to undergo a proposed $270 million in major renovations and upgrades that would be expected to be completed by 2019.
“USC takes great pride in its Olympic heritage, and there is tremendous excitement across the entire university community about our role in Los Angeles’ 2024 Olympic bid,” President C. L. Max Nikias said. “Just as we did in 1984, USC will play host to a number of high profile sporting events at our state-of-the-art athletic facilities.”
The newly revamped Coliseum would more than likely play host to its third opening and closing ceremonies, while the Galen Center would also entertain international competition.
The brand-new, 15-acre USC Village, which will play a role in accommodating those at the Media Village, is scheduled to open in Fall 2017 and would have the opportunity to vault the University straight onto the global forefront.
“As a USC alum, I’m proud that the media, officials and other supporters of the athletes will have the opportunity to call USC’s world-class campus home during the Games,” LA24 Vice Chair and director of athlete relations Janet Evans said.
Don’t forget that as at least one NFL team is making the move to Los Angeles in 2016, a 300-acre, multi-billion dollar, state-of-the-art stadium complex will be breaking ground just a few miles away from downtown L.A. in Inglewood. And if that wasn’t enough, the newly founded Los Angeles Football Club is building a 22,000 seat soccer-specific venue, located on the land that was home to the former Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, adjacent to the Coliseum.
The world-class venues that are currently present and those that are set to be built in the surrounding USC community, in addition to those the facilities already exist or are expected to go up on campus, signify the ideal fusion between the past and the future when it comes to Los Angeles serving as the home of the world’s grandest sporting event.
This goes hand-in-hand with LA24’s “Back to the Future” vision, which aims to trace some roots back to the 1984 Los Angeles Games, while still showcasing the future of the city, in hopes of leaving a forward-facing, lasting legacy.
Just a little over 30 years ago, Los Angeles dazzled on the world stage for two weeks, hosting one of the most successful games ever, thanks largely in part to the hospitality of USC. Fast forward a few decades later, the University is again a major stakeholder in making sure history repeats itself.

Former USC basketabll star Sam Clancy (1998-2002) will be inducted into the Pac-12 Hall of Honor during a ceremony prior to the championship game at the 2016 Pac-12 Men’s Basketball Tournament March 12. He will be honored along with 11 other inductees including Salim Stoudamire (Arizona), Art Becker (Arizona State), Brian Hendrick (Cal), Scott Wedman (Colorado), Luke Ridnour (Oregon), Jim Anderson (Oregon State), Kim Belton (Stanford), Keith Erickson (UCLA), Vern Gardner (Utah), Isaiah Thomas (Washington) and Keith Morrison (Washington State).
Clancy is the 15th Trojan to enter the Pac-12 Hall of Honor, joining Bill Sharman, Tex Winter, Bob Boyd, John Rudometkin, Mo Layton, Ron Riley, Paul Westphal, Gus Williams, John Block, Harold Miner, Sam Barry, Forrest Twogood, Wayne Carlander and Alex Hannum.
In the 2000-01 season, Clancy led the Trojans to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament, for which he was named to the East Regional All-Tournament team.
After returning for his senior season, Clancy was named the 2002 Pac-12 Player of the Year and was named a consensus second team All-American, though USC bowed out in the first round of the tournament.
During his four years, the power forward was also named a two-time all-conference selection. He left USC as the team’s third-leading all-time scorer with 1,657 points and as its leader in blocks with 195 (now second).
While at USC, the four-year starter led the Trojans to a combined record of 77-47, playing an integral role in helping lead the Men of Troy to the Elite Eight in 2001. The Trojans also played in the final of the 2002 Pac-10 Tournament where Clancy earned All-Tournament team honors.
At the end of his senior campaign, Clancy entered the 2002 NBA draft and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the 45th pick (in the second round). He was out for the entirety of his rookie season with a knee injury, however, and was waived the following year prior to being picked up by the Fayetteville Patriots in the NBA D-League.
Clancy has found success overseas, playing for Iraklis Thessaloniki, Cocodrilos de Caracas of the Venezuelan LBP, Incheon ET Land Black Slamer of the Korean Basketball League, the Russian Super League teams UNICS Kazan, Ural Great Perm and CSK VVS Samara, the Spanish ACB League team Grupo Capitol Valladolid and the French League team Le Mans Sarthe Basket. He is currently the starting small forward for Gimnasia Indalo in Argentina.

Coming off two disappointing losses on the road to Oregon (15-4) and Oregon State (12-6), the Trojans look to regain their footing in Pac-12 play with an upcoming home game against struggling foe Washington State (9-10). With an impressive 15-3 start to the season, the Trojans found themselves ranked No. 21 in the AP top 25 poll, their highest mark in eight years.
Yet, their two game slide is indicative of some major issues the team still must address. In the previous two games, the Trojans have really struggled defensively as well as shooting the ball. The Trojans must address these issues to come up with a victory against Washington State.
Against Oregon, the team gave up 89 points on a nearly 44 percent shooting from the field. USC’s up-tempo style in combination with its lack of defensive energy led to many easy scores for Oregon big men Elgin Cook and Chris Boucher. While the Trojans were able to score the ball, a more consistent effort on defense will be required for competing with the talented teams in the Pac-12.
The game against Oregon State revealed much of the same issues for the Trojans. Again, USC failed to display the adequate amount of effort and discipline to defend teams. After leading 40-36 at the half, USC gave up 49 points in the second half. This in combination with an awful shooting night — 34 percent from the field and 25 percent on 3s — led to the Trojans dropping their second disappointing game in a row.
In order to rebound with a victory at the Galen Center on Thursday, the Trojans must improve their interior defense. The hallmark of a good defensive team is preventing points in the paint and open 3-pointers. This is because mid-range jump shots are statistically the least efficient shots in basketball. A major key to the game will be USC’s ability to dictate the types of shots Washington State takes.
If USC is able to prevent interior looks for Washington State’s big men and tightly contest 3-point shots, the Trojans will have an excellent chance of winning the game.
Another key point to watch closely is how the Trojans begin the game offensively. In the previous game, the Trojans struggled mightily to shoot the ball, so it will be very important for the team to run their offense and get out in transition to get easier shots.
If USC is able to address these keys to the game, they should have no problem defeating Washington State again. If the past is any indication, USC should be able to score very efficiently and get back to their exciting up-tempo style that led to their early season success.
With the renewed energy from being at home, the Trojans should improve defensively and have a result very similar to their 90-77 victory the last time these two teams met.

Yasmine Kahsai | Daily Trojan

With the end of college looming in the foreseeable future, I feel a little bit like I’m balancing quite precariously on a ledge. In my mind it’s a little bit like those cartoons where the bad guy is chasing you, you see a clearing up ahead and think you’re about to get away for good until you realize you’ve come to the edge of a cliff overlooking a canyon below. Then, you scramble trying not to fall off as you realize you have completely run out of room to flee. 
But what exactly is it that I’m running from? And what’s on the other side of the canyon anyway?
Throughout my three and a half years of college so far, I can recall countless times when I’ve been told to cherish my time here because college is “the best time of your life.” Don’t get me wrong, college is great, but it’s a little bit frightening to constantly be told that life will never get any better than this. Of course this isn’t to be taken 100 percent literally, but after hearing it so often it’s hard to resist believing it.
Then of course there’s the fear of what exactly I’ll do in life. I feel lucky that I actually have a good idea of what I want to do. Knowing that I want to pursue a career in journalism has given me structure, but the options still seem overwhelmingly endless. I’m a little bit afraid that I’ll make a wrong decision somewhere along the way — that I’ll move to a city or accept a job that I’ll later come to regret. It seems like every time I’ve devised a plan to get across the metaphorical cartoon canyon, I look down and remember that I’m scared of heights. 
This past weekend, a friend who graduated last year came to visit and quelled some of my fears. Six months into her post-graduate life, she’s alive to tell the tale – and it’s not actually that bad, she said.  She assured me that life doesn’t end after college.  It just changes, sometimes in ways that you would never expect. 
After graduating from USC with a degree in Business and Cinematic Arts, she changed her career before she started a career. After graduating in May, she moved back home to New Jersey, and took a three-month coding class that would give her a leg up on the tech jobs she was interested in, even if she didn’t know she had an interest in the tech industry while she was at USC.  Now, she’s in a position to land her dream job, and hosted a house-warming party at her new apartment in New York City just last week. Before she left L.A. on Monday night she received emails alerting her to two job interviews she received for the upcoming week. 
She’s still standing on the edge too, still easing into life in New York City, getting used to her new neighborhood and working on landing a job. But she’s standing on the edge confidently, knowing that the fun part of life isn’t over, that there’s a lot more to come.
As I stand on the edge of the real world there are a lot of unknowns. But for the time being, I’m taking comfort in the fact that college seniors across the nation are standing alongside me, and I’m not the only one in this precarious position. Life beyond college might be different, but just like anything else in life, it is what you make of it. Society puts such an emphasis on college being your last sliver of freedom before signing your life away to corporate America, but maybe I’m just on the edge of something better.

As Trojans across campus stand upon the precipice of another Undergraduate Student Government election season — candidates’ websites will go live on Thursday — they are also mentally preparing themselves for the barrage of Facebook profile picture changes, debates between candidates and frenetic Trousdale Parkway campaigning that will color the next few weeks.
It’s heartening to see that the past year’s focus on diversity and inclusion within USG has allowed the organizations to look within — namely, to accurately assess whether or not USG structurally contains the diversity and inclusion that has painted external advocacy over the last semester. So as elections begin, it’s important that changes in USG rules — both the dismantling of Senate constituencies and the creation of the Positional Leadership Stipend — will make USG elections more representative of the student body.
Upon further reflection, it’s unclear why the specific Senate constituencies ever existed — considering that these demographics do not accurately represent the student body. Before the change, the 12 USG Senate seats were divided up into six residential, three greek and three commuter constituencies. An April 2014 USC admissions blog clocks in commuter students at 10 percent of the undergraduate student body. For these students to have a quarter of Senate representation seems undemocratic — but at the same time, it could be an important distinction for commuter concerns that often do not receive the attention they deserve. So, as USG moves forward with its new rules, it should keep an eye on commuter interests to ensure that they don’t fall by the wayside.
The new rules also restructure Senate constituencies to better represent greek interests. According to U.S. News and World Report, greek students comprise just 3,500 of the almost 19,000 undergraduate students at USC — that is, only 18.7 percent of Trojans participate in greek life. Compared to the 25 percent of representation greek interests were given in the Senate, it begs the question: If greek students have a louder voice, whose voices are they overshadowing?
Adding insult to injury is the greater institutional support that greek student leaders are already given within USG. It’s no secret that greek “armies” offer huge numerical advantages to greek candidates for both Senate and other leadership positions by storming voting booths and promoting candidates within their house on social media. This is even more true for new members, who could be instructed to support candidates as part of their pledging process.
But it’s not just greek student leaders who are given institutional support. Much like politics outside the gates of USC, it’s those who are given the access, guidance and means to run a successful campaign. That’s what makes the introduction of the Positional Leadership Stipend, which financially supports low-income student leaders, so crucial to changing this unfortunate reality. It’s both an important source of emotional and financial support for those whose thankless advocacy has changed our campus and an admirably self-aware realization that, in order to continue advocacy for diversity and inclusion, student leadership should be diverse and inclusive.
It’s no surprise that this election season will be one of unprecedented proportions, given the never-before-seen rise in size and scope of campus politics in the past year. Moreover, predictions that every Senate seat will be competitive this year — as opposed to the 12 unopposed seats last year — suggest that the election season will be an important transition step to see how USG leadership will evolve from a year of highly visible advocacy over controversial issues. Trojans, grab your popcorn and find a bench on Trousdale — or by your laptop. It’s going to be a wild ride.
Sonali Seth is a sophomore majoring in political science and policy, planning, development. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan. “’SC, What’s Good?” runs every other Thursday.
Correction: A previous version of this column stated that, prior to the changes in Senate constituencies, there were four residential, four greek and four commuter Senators. There were six residential, three greek and three residential. The column has also been updated to correct the respective percentages. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
In the past, a plurality of voter turnout has been greek. One thing I’m afraid of is that it will lead to an even more disproportional representation of Greeks in the senate versus what exists now. I guess the argument can be made that if the greeks turn out, they deserve the seats, but they already have IFC/PHC as a voice to the admins.
On the other hand, these changes will make it literally impossible for a commuter to get a senate seat or run to truly represent the commuter community without having to pander to the former Res and Greek constituencies. Turnout among commuters has always been historically low (Total voter turnout under 350) while some individual residential and/or greek candidates received over 1000 votes.

It isn’t uncommon to find personalities as diverse as the city itself on an Uber ride in Los Angeles. Artists, engineers, students and chefs number a few of those using the ride-sharing app as a part — or even full-time opportunity for supplemental income. Among the more eclectic drivers I’ve met are a sound mixer for Power 106, a refugee and aspiring Broadway actress.
Especially in a city known for entertainment, Uber has singlehandedly powered a “creative underclass” traditionally supported by jobs such as waiting tables. The flexible hours and lax requirements to work — drivers only need a license — have created a huge workforce of casual drivers. A New York Times article this week reported that Uber’s decent pay and self-determined work hours have easily made it one of the biggest choices for actors and writers in Los Angeles.
Uber’s success can hardly be understated; a company worth $62.5 billion, it was rated one of the 50 most powerful American companies within five years of its creation. Discussions about startups in the service sector quickly devolve into comparisons to “Uber for __”. However, its explosive growth and race for cheaper fare has been matched by a downgrade in the quality of life of its drivers. Sluggishness in regulating Uber’s workforce has made the service a technocratic Band-Aid to larger structural issues with American labor. Moreover, the service takes advantage of the very workers it purports to empower.
While the company denotes the median salary of its UberX drivers in the $90,000 range, few workers surveyed ever reported making near those numbers. Given repeated price slashes in the 20 percent and 30 percent range after the installation of UberX, the company’s most popular and cheapest service, workers have reported revenue decreases that create unlivable wages for full-time drivers. Given the costs of car maintenance, gas, car washes, insurance and amenities, true wages remain far lower. The fare war between Uber and Lyft — its next largest competitor in the ride-sharing business — have decimated wages for drivers with no power to speak out.
Uber drivers don’t just include artists looking for their next big break; they include displaced factory workers, long-term temps or full-time workers struggling to make ends meet. Even now, an army of temporary workers have supported nearly a fifth of American job growth since the recession. Economic behemoths like Microsoft have consistently been reprimanded for hiring temps for years in order to dodge employee benefits. This state of helplessness resembles — if not closely mimics — the concerns of drivers living at the hands of a company without any real bargaining chips for workers’ rights.
Companies like Uber and other micro-contract services like Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Postmates and Instacart are rooted in the “sharing economy,” a connected economic model where users share and swap assets rather than purchasing them. Despite their intent to provide simple, flexible wages for a cash-strapped middle and lower-class, they have only served as support for some quick cash rather than a solution to real problems with wages. A self-congratulatory article by the company on its frequent use by teachers as well its recent attempt to hire retail workers recently fired by Wal-Mart belies its lack of real, sustainable opportunities for workers. Underemployed workers may use the service to make some quick cash, but recently few workers have been able to make close to that of taxi drivers. As a lesser of two evils, the company provides a Band-Aid solution for workers but uses a contract model to keep them a silent party in labor agreements.
Real solutions depend on real rights for workers. Uber already faces legal action in the United Kingdom for employment law violations in its lack of rest breaks, minimum wages, holiday pay or work caps. Recent court rulings that have identified Uber workers as employees rather than contractors may be the first steps toward recognizing the work of laborers in the sharing economy. As much as technical innovations have increased the pace of our economy, they have not freed workers from a need to organize and fight for Social Security benefits and more stable wages.
The sharing economy presents new challenges for workers rights, but technological advancements should not rely on the abuse of struggling workers. The constant wage decreases, often up to 30 percent at a time, are a prime example of how economic interests between competing companies have had no regard to drivers in the ride-sharing business. Artists who used to make almost $25 an hour have seen their revenues dip to $10, wages that are barely livable for full-time employees. The recent ruling by the California Labor Commission marking drivers as employees rather than contractors marks a first step towards accountability; while the lines are fuzzy in such a new line of work, providing no regulation leaves drivers by the roadside.
Most importantly, the explosion of part-time Uber drivers highlight a larger problem at hand: one where teachers and retail workers are paid so little that they have to rely on secondary means of income. The heavy presence of a company whose labor force thrives on struggling workers speaks volumes as to wage inequities in Los Angeles. Even at universities like USC, low wages and lesser job protections have highlighted a need for worker protections via unionization. While worker opposition may play an important role in demanding needed regulations to protect workers, policymakers should question the underlying problems with the treatment of American labor. Uber may market itself as a solution for people to find easy employment or quick side cash, but its very existence raises questions about the labor pool itself.

“Whatever happened to predictability / The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV?” Though old-fashioned milkmen and paperboys have yet to make their return, the beloved 1987-95 family sitcom Full House will be premiering its official reboot as Fuller House, a Netflix original series set to debut Feb. 26. Nineties kids everywhere are getting ready to “Netflix and chill” with Danny, Joey, Uncle Jesse, Aunt Becky, D.J., Stephanie and the notorious Kimmy Gibbler.
The majority of the original cast has agreed to be a part of the show’s spinoff, inundating their fans with a wave of nostalgia that is complete with a set design mimicking the living room of the famous San Francisco residency. Having been abandoned for 21 years, the house from Full House is revamped and ready to occupy an even fuller house than before.
John Stamos, who will reprise his role of the suave Uncle Jesse while producing the show, told People that the cast “never stopped loving each other. That magic you saw? It’s still there because it never stopped from the day we ended the show.” Stamos, who has been working closely with the original creator Jeff Franklin, is finally seeing progress being made towards giving “credit to the legacy,” which is what he disclosed to Jimmy Kimmel. Though the 13 episode series has its twists and turns, Fuller House still pays its respects to its predecessor.
Since the finale of Full House, the focus of Fuller House has transitioned to the younger generation, with D.J. Tanner-Fuller being a recently widowed, pregnant mother of two seeking the help of her younger sister Stephanie and her best friend Kimmy. The all too familiar plot line features more friendly faces as Stamos, along with Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin, have come back to guest star as the older generation. Michelle Tanner, who was played by both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, is the only role that will not be renewed in Fuller House.
The beloved actors have tweeted and Instagrammed pictures from script copies to
on-set selfies in hopes of getting fans riled up for their highly awaited return. Aside from the main characters, other recurring roles will be featured during the show such as Scott Weinger as D.J.’s
ex-boyfriend Steve and Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit as Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky’s twins Nicky and Alex, respectively. The pilot episode will include an official Tanner household reunion, titled “Our Very First Show, Again,” similar to the one that occurred
off-stage when the producers, creators and actors came together this past summer to start filming the series. According to Candace Cameron Bure, who plays D.J. in the show, the original Full House family was not solely representative of a close-knit bunch.

It’s a hot, humid day in October. Synth-pop is leaking out of hidden speakers in the Dubai Mall’s food court, where hundreds of hungry people are drowning out the music with their chattering. A 12-year-old girl is waiting in line at Subway, trying to decide between a meatball marinara and a turkey breast sub when she feels someone press up against her. Whoever it is pushes her against the plastic counter she’s leaning against. Strong arms come up on either side of her, hands pressed against the cool glass of the display case.
In that moment, panic grips her and she freezes. Some small part of her recognizes the man caging her as the one she’d spotted earlier while wandering around, trying to decide what to eat. He’s old enough to be her grandfather. There’s a leer on his face. Her heart is beating wildly. As sirens blare in her head, she experiences the situation as though it is happening to someone else. A few more seconds, the man’s sour breath wafting over her face, and things snap back into motion. She pushes his arm away with adrenaline-fueled force, and runs to where her mother is waiting on the other side of the large food court.
Seven years ago, I was that girl. That is my first clear memory of sexual harassment. In the days following that incident, I would ask myself, “Was it my fault? Was I asking for it?”
Later, I would learn that many people ask themselves the same question after they’re sexually harassed, or worse, raped.
In Asking For It: The Alarming Rise of Rape Culture – And What We Can Do About It, Kate Harding explores the phenomena of rape culture and victim blaming, as well as rape myths and the politics of sexual assault.
“Rape culture? [… ]Isn’t such overblown terminology the kind of thing that makes people call feminists ‘humorless’ and ‘strident,’ and accuse us of holing up in our ivory towers, theorizing about human behavior without ever witnessing much of it?” writes Harding on the first page of her book.
Harding is, of course, correct. The term rape culture evokes violent images, and invites shame to make itself at home in our minds. But is rape culture really a thing? Yes, is the definitive answer, it seems, as Harding explores how rape jokes, the glamorization of sexual violence, and slut shaming have become the norm.
Rape culture is often defined as an environment where rape is prevalent and in which sexual violence against women is normalized and excused by pop culture and the media.
Harding easily and succinctly sums up the very real implications of ubiquitous rape culture: “When it comes to rape, if we’re expected to put ourselves in anyone’s shoes at all, it’s the accused rapist’s. The questions that inevitably come along with ‘What was she wearing?’ and ‘How much did she have to drink?’ are, ‘What if there was no rape at all? What if she’s lying?’”
Harding’s book is not an anthology of sexual assault stories, which would be infinitely morbid, not to mention traumatic for those who have experienced such assault. It is, however, a witty and concise explanation of everything that is wrong with our culture. A recent survey revealed that 29.7 percent of female undergraduate students at USC have experienced some form of sexual assault. More to the point, the USC Department of Public Safety routinely sends out notifications about “butt-grabbing” males assaulting unsuspecting college students across and around campus.
“Not all men!” cry the staunch Men’s Rights Activists and those who believe that feminists hate all males. But while not all men are rapists and sex offenders, every woman and girl has been catcalled, and one in every five women have been sexually harassed and/or assaulted. Being female means growing up with the knowledge that at any moment, you could be attacked, walking alone is never a good idea, you must never leave your drinks unattended, you must take precaution after precaution to shield yourself from the barest possibility of attracting the wrong kind of attention.
“Every seven minutes, someone in America commits a rape,” writes Harding, unraveling the ugly truth.
Feminism, to me, is held to the same standard as the Declaration of Independence (although I am not an American citizen): “We hold these truths to be self-evident.” In this case, those truths are the unalienable rights of every female to live without fear of sexual assault — and I’m certain Harding would agree.

It’s amazing to think that contemporary music has evolved so much within the past 10 years. From the beaming sounds of EDM to the groovy synth beats of pop, the integration of different technologies and sounds have allowed artists to create more than just a sonic landscape for their music. Sonically cohesive and lyrically robust, the tracks in Brooklyn pop trio Wet’s debut album give listeners a sense of intimacy and nostalgia that is rare to find in today’s contemporary music scene.
Leading singer-songwriter Kelly Zutrau and instrumentalists Joe Valle and Marty Sulkow debuted their first song “Don’t Wanna Be Your Girl” in 2013. Following their critical acclaim for the single, the group has been placed on a plethora of lists and honors, including Pandora’s “Artist to Watch in 2016.” With the anticipation of the debut album, fans have been eager to see what new sounds Wet has to offer. Unsurprisingly, Wet has remained consistent with its utilization of simple chords to emphasize the lyrics and voice of Kelly Zutrau.
Though it feels like the tracks in Don’t You are a cycle of reused beats and lyrics, the band does not deviate from the overall intimate and yearning feeling of the album. Don’t You sets the mood with “It’s All in Vain,” a track that somewhat resembles a mix between Tinashé and Banks. In contrast to a few other tracks in the album, Zutrau’s vocals in this track are noticeably stronger.
Zutrau’s songwriting skills are especially highlighted in the tracks “Weak” and “All the Ways.” The chorus “I don’t ever wanna leave you / I never wanna be alone again / All the ways, all the ways” in the “All the Ways” trumps in comparison with that of every other track in the album. “Weak” is a close second, with its haunting message about the dominating nature of love.
Instrumentals play a rather large role in the production of the album. The final track “These Days” leaves much to be desired. Zutrau’s vocals are drowned out in the middle of the piano and hazy, buzzing sounds in the background. Dynamic production, or lack thereof, seems to be the minor issue with the 11-track album.
Overall, Wet’s debut album Don’t You showcases their potential for stardom in a time where different musical genres are beginning to mix and overlap with one another. Their combination of alternative mood, contemporary R&B sounds and pop-based lyrical content are what really will impress listeners and music fans. In essence, Don’t You accomplished the trio’s effort to create a consistent mood and tone; however, the lack of emphasis or change among the tracks will leave some listeners without a strong impression of Wet’s talent and versatility.
Don’t You is an album worth listening to for fans of Banks, the XX, Tinashé or FKA twigs. With its debut, Wet has shown fans and listeners what the band’s potential is.

Vince Gilligan, creator, writer and executive producer of the Emmy award-winning TV series Breaking Bad and its spinoff Better Call Saul, spoke Tuesday night in the Bing Theatre about the changing landscape of the television industry, the importance of organic writing and the inspiration behind his most popular shows.
The event, hosted by the Undergraduate Student Government Program Board, USC Special Events Committee and USC Speakers Committee and moderated by Interim Dean of the School of Dramatic Arts David Bridel, featured a question-and-answer period with Gilligan, followed by a meet and greet.
Gilligan, who started out writing for The X-Files before pioneering his own show with Breaking Bad, described the process that got him into the television industry as somewhat fortuitous. A graduate of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, Gilligan spent the first five years after graduating from college writing film scripts, a career he had dreamed of since the third grade. However, after a chance meeting with Chris Carter, the screenwriter for The X-Files at that time, he embraced television as a new medium for creative expression.
“It was very cinematic filmmaking [on The X-Files], and I’d been a movie fan all my life, but I really started learning about cinema on that show,” Gilligan said. “That means telling stories through pictures instead of talk; some of the best moments on The X-Files and some of the best moments on Breaking Bad are the moments between characters, the looks that pass between people, the nonverbal storytelling.”
A native of Richmond, Virginia, Gilligan was initially hesitant to make the move to Los Angeles in order to begin his work in the television industry; however, after settling in, he spent seven years writing for The X-Files before breaking off to write on his own. The slump period that followed was the inspiration for what would become Breaking Bad; Gilligan recalled a conversation with a fellow unemployed writer, who joked that the two of them should get rich quick by installing a meth lab in an RV. Although Gilligan knew that he would never realistically turn to cooking meth for his livelihood, he wondered what it would take to convince an average-law abiding citizen to take someone up on that offer, a thought process that eventually created the character of Walter White.
“I was interested in taking a good, straight arrow, boring guy and turning him into a real villain, a real criminal,” Gilligan said. “I wanted to see how bad this guy could get and have people still interested.”
Viewer interest drove Gilligan to keep writing, developing much-loved characters such as Saul Goodman and Jesse Pinkman beyond the original frames he had for their characters. It also led him to defy many commonly-accepted rules for television writing, such as the need to start with quick action or witty dialogue. Instead, Breaking Bad utilizes a slower form of storytelling, one that draws its viewers in visually, a characteristic that Gilligan said is especially important in the rapidly changing world of entertainment.
“In a world where we have everything pulling at us with different forms of media, YouTube, all the channels, the Internet, conventional wisdom says that you have to hook [viewers] fast,” Gilligan said. “I really think what’s held us in good standing on Breaking Bad is going the opposite way because most of the time folks don’t.”
Gilligan’s approach toward screenwriting parallels his belief in a careful exposition; when describing his advice towards burgeoning writers, he emphasized the need to allow characters to develop naturally rather than forcibly. As a result, the story would flow, but only if the writer is willing to flow along with it.
“I was so lucky about how much I didn’t know [going into the show],” Gilligan said. “I didn’t have any clue in those first years that the show would blow up like it did, so I treated it like an experiment. If, as a writer, you get too rigid, you cease to be able to make lemonade out of lemons and you lose out on a lot of good stuff.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate heard updates from the Political Student Assembly, Greek Sens. Chris Fong and Sanjay Mahboobani and a funding proposal for a second annual wheelchair basketball tournament at their meeting Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
USG Vice President Jordan Fowler began the Senate meeting by mentioning that the MyUSC webpage will be undergoing updates. The outdated web page will be replaced with a mobile friendly version, and the creators are currently conducting a beta test. The new MyUSC page will be relaunched in three weeks.
“It’s going to have a totally new interface, with new features that are way more user-friendly for students,” Fowler said.
PSA director Jenny Di then spoke about the first debate between the USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans. Roughly 70 people attended the event, and PSA elaborated on its goals to engage students during a fiery election year.
“We’ve been focusing on the election a lot this year because it is an election year. We’re trying to balance election coverage and debates along with trying to get people interested in politics, because some people aren’t interest, they’re turned off,” Di said.
Fong and Mahboobani then  provided an update on greek life. This upcoming Sunday, Fong has planned a sexual assault seminar led by Ekta Kumar, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Center for Women and Men, Sexual Assault Resource Center. The senators are expecting at least 70 attendees to turnout.
“We’re going to bring in all chapter presidents and other e-board members from the houses to discuss consent, how to party safely, how we can still have our advance but do it in a way that doesn’t get us in trouble and respects the values of [greek life],” Fong said.
After speaking with Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry about the deferred recruitment resolution, it appears the conversation came to no conclusion.
“We met with Dr. Carry the week after we proposed it to senate, and we are expecting to get a decision at the end of the semester,” Fong said. “Unfortunately we still haven’t, but we’re still having that conversation with the Academic Senate.”
Sen. Giuseppe Robalino asked the senators on the two competing resolutions; one from the Faculty Senate for deferring recruitment and other from USG Senate against the proposed changes.
“Has this created a healthy conversation? This hasn’t caused a backlash or problems or stopped it in its tracks?” Robalino asked.
Fong praised the Interfraternity Council and assured Robalino of the relatively smooth roll-out of both resolutions.
“The IFC is fighting its fight on their end and bringing their own resolutions in. They have done a good job,” Fong said.
The senate meeting ended with a senate funding request for a Wheelchair Basketball Tournament, who are planning a second tournament in 2016. The 2015 tournament was organized by Zack Wentz, a sophomore majoring in economics, and sponsored by USC Trojan Pride, in conjunction with USG University Affairs Committee and Wellness Affairs Committee to bring awareness to disability accessibility on campus. Wentz requested funds from the Senate after Trojan Pride was unable to fund the tournament for the second year. Wentz spoke about the success of the 2015 tournament as evidence for making the tournament an annual event.
“We had about eight teams last year, we raised a lot of awareness, people that had disabilities were able to participate and they brought their friends.,” Wentz said. “It was a great turnout.”

Carlo Avencena’s seared sake-marinated salmon with edamame flan, sweet and sour kale and crispy Bhutanese rice claimed first place in the fourth-annual USC Culinary Challenge Tuesday at the Radisson at USC. Avencena, Kitchen Manager of the Lab Gastropub, will face the winners of similar competitions from regional universities after outscoring other chefs employed by the University at the cooking battle hosted by USC Hospitality.
The American Culinary Federation-sanctioned event is part of a broader collegiate movement to provide healthier and more nutritious food options to the students and faculty.
The Challenge had two separate cooking competitions where six chefs were timed for an hour and a half to prepare and cook their dishes for three international master chefs flown in as judges. Though they could choose their center plate, the chefs were given mandatory ingredients to construct their dishes. The chefs were graded on a numerical scale, with points given for sanitation, organization, flavor, plating and cooking technique.
The winners of the first competition were Olga Cordon and Yesina Duran from EVK with their version of cultivated mushroom cakes with rad na rice noodles and edamame sauce.
The second competition was among the chefs on campus, who volunteered and brought their own recipes. Avencena, the winner of this culinary competition, will continue on to a regional competition, and then the winner of that will go on to the national competition hosted by the National Association of College & University Food Services.
Erik Russell, associate director of residential dining, said that the competition is a way to change the perception of what USC Hospitality is trying to do with on-campus dining.
“A lot of people think that we just serve frozen food on campus and that is not what we do. This is just a way to highlight and showcase what we are trying to do,” Russell said. “We are working toward more transparent, more local, sustainable, organic ingredients and really elevating the quality and flavor game.”
The University provides chefs working at restaurants like Seeds, Morton Fig and Café 84 with educational opportunities to advance their culinary careers. These opportunities include monthly meetings with Executive Chef Eric Ernest and a certification program with the ACF to become a certified chef, according to Assistant Vice President of Auxiliary Services Kris Klinger. Klinger attests that teaching Hospitality’s chefs this thoroughly is important to improving the quality of dining hall cuisine.
“We want our chefs to be globally trained, ready and built to explore flavor combinations and classical cooking techniques for sustainable futures and healthy and nutritional food options,” Klinger said. “If we consume ourselves with learning about what is fresh and what is quality, and we develop under that, then that is what we are going to have in mind when we are making our next menu.”
Although this schooling gives the chefs a strong foundation to work with, Ernest was excited about how the competition challenged Hospitality’s chefs.
“Schooling gives you a baseline of skills, and then this is us being able to explore certain ingredients,” Ernest said. “But this competition challenges us to take it to the next level, and maybe we make an edamame foam or maybe we flavor that foam with something that matches the flavor of our dish. That is what is exciting for our chefs.”
Editor’s Note: This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Executive Chef Eric Ernest’s name. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently announced a potential increase in  power rates by up to 24 percent over the next five years, pending a vote by the L.A. City Council in the near future.
The LADWP’s rate change plan involves increasing prices gradually over time by a few percentage points each year. By slowly increasing rates, consumers will not bear the full brunt of rate hikes all at once, according to the LADWP.
L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti recently expressed his support for the proposal, saying that the increases will allow the LADWP to modernize infrastructure, transition to more sustainable energy sources, and provide higher quality customer service.
“Over the next 15 years, LADWP will be replacing 70 percent of its existing power supply to meet state mandates, fight climate change and fund the energy efficiency programs that enable customers to lower their bills even as rates rise,” Garcetti said in a statement.
Students have reacted in various ways to the new proposals, with some claiming that the rate increases are unnecessary and will seriously impact their budgets.
“The power rate increases will just add to my living expenses, and rent is already ridiculous,” said Tufan Nadjafi, a sophomore majoring in public relations. “It will affect students immensely over the next five years.”
Other students thought the power rate increases could be justified based on the proposed plans to increase sustainability and customer service quality.
“Honestly, if we end up paying $12 more each month, it won’t make that much of a difference for me,” said Sarahbelle Selig, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “If that’s what they need to do to supply better service, I think it’s worth it.”
How much power bills will increase per year largely depends on individual levels of power consumption. For example, low-use residential consumers can expect an 18 percent increase in their monthly bills over the next five years, while high-use residential customers may experience rate increases as high as 24 percent per month, according to the LADWP website. For a typical residential consumer, these percentage increases translate to about $6-12 more per month in electricity costs or about $75-150 more per year.
The LADWP stresses that the additional revenue gained from these rate increases will be effectively allocated toward meeting sustainability and reliability goals and mandates. Should the Los Angeles City Council vote to enact the rate hikes, an estimated $4.5 billion will be spent over the next five years to modernize infrastructure to increase reliability and efficiency. Another $6.2 billion will be put towards clean energy goals, which include generating a third of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and completely eliminating coal-fired power plants by 2024.
The proposal also aims to make significant customer service enhancements, improving the overall customer experience. Increasing the timeliness of bills and maintenance is a priority, as well as creating self-service options to boost efficiency.
Garcetti highlighted the necessity and urgency of these comprehensive changes in the statement.
“After five years of rate increases, the typical residential customer would see a $6-12 increase in their monthly bill,” Garcetti said. “The price of inaction would be much higher than this.”
Voting on the proposal is expected within the next two months, and upon passage the first rate hikes will likely be implemented in April.

..The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and the brain initiative are the worst scams ever perpetrated on the American people.  Former U. S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin Warns: Biochips Hazardous to Your Health: Warning, biochips may cause behavioral changes and high suicide rates.
State Attorney Generals are to revoke the licenses of doctors and dentists that implant chips in patients. Chip used illegally for GPS, tracking, organized crime, communication and torture. Virginia state police have been implanting citizens without their knowledge and consent for years and they are dying! Check out William and Mary’s site to see the torture enabled by the biochip and the Active Denial System.  See Terrorism and Mental Health by Amin Gadit or A Note on Uberveillance by MG & Katina Michael or Safeguards in a World of Ambient Intelligence by Springer or Mind Control,
Microchip Implants and Cybernetics. Check out the audio spotlight by Holosonics. The truth is the biochip works like a sim card. It received pulsed modulated laser beams and millimeter wave which it
converts into electromagnetic waves that your brain interprets into digital images and sound.  It then takes what your brain sees and hears and converts electromagnetic waves into digital and acoustic waves that a computer translates into audio and video. In other words, it allows law enforcement to see what you see, hear what you  hear and communicate directly with your brain.
“Former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) director and now Google Executive, Regina E. Dugan, has unveiled a super small, ingestible microchip that we can all be expected to swallow by 2017. “A means of authentication,” she calls it, also called an electronic tattoo, which takes
NSA spying to whole new levels. She talks of the ‘mechanical mismatch problem between machines and humans,’ and specifically targets 10 – 20 year olds in her rant about the wonderful qualities of this new technology that can stretch in the human body and still be functional. Hailed as a ‘critical shift for
research and medicine,’ these biochips would not only allow full access to insurance companies and government agencies to our pharmaceutical med-taking compliancy (or lack thereof), but also a host of other aspects of our lives which are truly none of their business, and certainly an extension of the
removal of our freedoms and rights.” Google News
The ARRA authorizes payments to the states in an effort to encourage Medicaid Providers to adopt and use “certified EHR technology” aka biochips.  ARRA will match Medicaid $5 for every $1 a
state provides. Hospitals are paid $2 million to create “crisis stabilization wards” (Gitmo’s) where state police torture people – even unto death.  They stopped my heart 90 times in 6 hours.  Virginia Beach EMT’s were called to the scene. Mary E. Schloendorff, v. The Society of New York Hospital 105 N. E. 92, 93 (N. Y. 1914) Justice Cardozo states, “every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation
without his patient’s consent, commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages. (Pratt v Davis, 224 Ill. 300; Mohr v Williams, 95 Minn. 261.) This case precedent requires police to falsely arrest you or kidnap you and call you a mental health patient in order to force the implant on you. You can also be forced to have a biochip if you have an infectious disease – like Eboli or Aids. Coalition of Justice vs the City of Hampton, VA settled a case out of court for $500,000 and removal of the biochip. Torture is
punishable by $1,000 per day up to $2 million; Medical battery is worth $2.05 million. They told my family it was the brain initiative.  I checked with the oversight board, and it is not!  Mark Warner told me it was research with the Active Denial System by the College of William and Mary, the USAF, and state and local law enforcement. It is called IBEX and it is excruciating. I have had 3 surgeries at the site of the implant and need another. It causes cancer! I’ve been tortured for 8 years by Virginia law enforcement.
