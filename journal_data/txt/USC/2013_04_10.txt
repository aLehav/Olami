Though the crack epidemic is associated with the 1980s, former drug trafficker Rick Ross said the epidemic still affects people today.
Ross spoke Wednesday about the history of the crack epidemic and its current impact on society at a discussion hosted by the Gould School of Law.
Jody Armour, professor of law,who hosted the event with former prosecutor Antonio J. Moore, kicked off the speech, “White Reign; the Rise and Fall of a Crack Empire,” by summarizing a report by Secretary of State John Kerry.
“The crack plague was the product of certain foreign policy priorities taking precedence over drug enforcement priorities,” Armour said. “That’s what was found in the Kerry report in 1987.”
Ross said that it was opportunity that separates him from the people he knew in prison.
“When I left prison, I had tears in my eyes because I was glad to come home,” Ross said, “but then I left friends [in prison] that I know were no worse of a person than I was and that the only reason that I was getting out was because the police just did not catch me right.”
Ross said the lack of job opportunities in South Central during the 1980s contributed to a rise in drug dealing.
“They are usually the guys who are willing to take a chance —trailblazers, almost,” Ross said. “Because, without that drive and without that energy, you will not do good in selling drugs.”
Armour said the crack epidemic in the United States was based on international conflicts in the 1980s between the U.S. and Nicaragua. Armour said the CIA helped to support a counter-revolutionary group in Nicaragua — the Contras — and used cocaine trade to support their efforts.
Armour also said this initial support of the drug trade was not meant to target the black community.
“What you had was a decision made that national security interests were more important than drug enforcement interests,” Armour said. “That’s because there is no personal animist against black America, rather it’s concern for the greater good.”
Ross said that since his release from prison, he has been using the same business skills he developed as a drug dealer to start new legitimate businesses, such as launching a T-shirt company and making a documentary.
“It is unbelievable how well the same type of skills work,” Ross said.
Though Ross has served his prison sentence, he is concerned about the current punishments for drug dealers.
“I believe that it is high time to say, ‘You know what, these guys have been in prison long enough for non-violent crimes,’” Ross said. “It’s time to cut their sentences, and we should make it retroactive. We should not be punishing guys who have committed non-violent crimes.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary from Monday, April 8.
Crime Against Property
at 6:30 P.m., a suspect entered an unsecured study room in Ray and Nadine Watt Hall of Architecture & Fine Arts and removed an unattended laptop computer.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:15 P.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a student behaving erratically at the Annenberg House and, upon arrival, observed him running up and down the street shouting incoherently. The student was physically restrained by the officers because of his combative behavior and a Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit was requested. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 3:59 P.m., DPS officers on a routine patrol observed two tents set up on a sidewalk blocking pedestrian traffic near 31st and Hope streets. The officers detained three suspects inside the tents and a check of their names revealed that one of them was a parolee at large. The suspect was then arrested and transported to 77th station for booking. The other suspects were advised to remove the tents and released.
at 3:16 P.m. , DPS officers responded to a report of an emergency shower that could not be shut off and was flooding the seventh floor of the Vivian Hall of Engineering after a student used it to rinse a chemical off his hand. Facilities Management Services personnel were requested and responded by shutting off the shower and cleaning up the water.
at 2:04 a.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling in the bike racks at University Gateway Apartments and detained him for investigation. The suspect was found in possession of a bike that did not belong to him, but the officers were unable to locate the owner to determine if a crime had occurred. The suspect was then released and the bike was turned over to a security guard at Gateway.

After 13 years of petitioning by the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, the university announced that they will join the Workers Rights Consortium.
Sweat-free ‘SC · The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation protested the use of sweat shop labor March 13 in front of Tommy Trojan. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Julia Wang, the campaign coordinator for the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, said the university’s decision to sign onto the WRC on March 27 is a large historical victory for SCALE as an organization.
“We have been asking the university to accept and really uphold our code of conduct for over a decade now,” Wang said. “In the last two years we have been sitting down with these administrators and talking with them to see how exactly USC can really work with the WRC and their code of conduct.”
The WRC is an independent monitoring organization that advocates for the rights of workers who make products that are sold in the United States. The consortium specifically focuses on workers who make clothes with college or university logos.
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said the university has high standards with the vendors it hires to produce USC apparel.
“USC has a long history of making dedicated efforts to help ensure that USC-branded merchandise is manufactured under safe and fair working conditions,” Jackson said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The standards and requirements of USC-licensed vendors are among the most stringent in higher education. Joining the WRC serves as another tool to further enhance our social responsibility programming as we continue our commitment to the fair treatment of workers making USC-licensed products.”
Wang said that SCALE has been working on the campaign since 2000.
“One hundred and eighty universities have already signed on to the WRC,” Wang said. “This was really a move in the right direction I think.”
In the 1990s, findings showed that Nike and other large companies were using sweatshop labor to make university apparel. When SCALE was established in 1997, it began to question administrators about the conditions at factories that make USC apparel, Wang said.
“After a lot of student activism and a lot of pressure put on by the university, the brands finally disclosed where the factories were,” Wang said.
Wang said student activism led the WRC to further investigate the sweatshop conditions, which led to findings of the factories where university apparel was made.
“Then the WRC went into a lot of these factories and checked out the locations of where these clothes were made and they found out that they were sweatshops and workers are forced to work overtime without pay,” Wang said.
SCALE has campaigned in a variety of ways to bring attention to this issue among the student body.
“The most effective actions were the fashion show we had at the beginning of last semester and also the vigil because those are really visible, really attention-getting events,” said Francisco Rios Casas, co-coordinator for student-and-campus worker relations. “We were able to regionalize new people and have a lot of people be involved.”
Some SCALE members said that, in addition to raising awareness, they wanted to ensure that action was taken.
“We really just wanted to show USC that this is an issue that students cared about [and] that there was a large base of student support on campus,” said Sarah Newell, a SCALE campaign coordinator. “[We wanted to] let the administration know that this is something that the students are truly interested in. From there, the administration was great in working with us to really make this a reality.”
Though there were obstacles to reaching their final goal, SCALE members said they understood the university’s need to be thorough. Newell said that the university was outlining a way to monitor when factories made USC apparel, and needed to be convinced that WRC would be adequate and cost-effective.
“I think [the administration’s] concern was whether or not the WRC was the absolute best use of USC’s dollars,” Newell said.
Though SCALE has been working on improving workers’ rights, specifically in the factories that make university apparel, they have also focused on other human rights areas as well.
“We want to continue to empower workers and students together on this campus and internationally with all members of the Trojan family,” Newell said. “We are so excited to have achieved this historic victory and it’s been phenomenal, but I think we are also ready to see how we can help on this campus.”
Newell said during its 16 years of existence, SCALE has grown as a “voice of activism” on campus has expanded its goals.
The group’s growing success throughout the years has only encouraged them to continue setting new goals for themselves in promoting justice.
“We will always be committed to helping workers both on campus, abroad and also throughout L.A.,” Rios Casas said. “We have been in contact with several organizations. For example, there was a dispute over a factory near Downtown L.A. and a lot of students went down to support the workers there and speak with them.”
SCALE’s efforts toward human rights are not limited to the global community and the surrounding community. The organization also focuses on the workers at the university.
“We hope to have more events in the near future where we can connect USC students and the workers who clean our classrooms and serve our food in the dining halls through events like meet and greets or workers appreciation brunches,” Rios Casas said. “We are still going to continue to support workers as much as we can.”
what’s your problem warren? This is a wonderful thing they have done.
More lame stuff from SCALE
I still can’t believe we’ve come this far. We did it! And the new team is so committed and talented, it makes me cry. It’s a good day. So glad it was finally announced; can’t wait to hear that Scott’s got those letters and the check.
Anyway, enough fawning… 
Onward. There’s much left to do.
m!

USC students’ commutes to campus might have gotten pricier in recent months since toll lanes were created on the 110 and 10 freeways for drivers wishing to speed past traffic. The new tolls have inspired mixed reactions from commuter students, who have now seen the lanes in action for more than four months.
Solo drivers can currently pay a toll, which consists of a fee per mile that varies with the level of congestion, to drive in the carpool lanes. According to the Los Angeles Times, the toll lanes on the 110, which can cost drivers up to $15.40 per trip to use, have sped traffic in toll lanes up by 10 mph on average, but the other lanes have slowed by about 8 mph.
Some experts believe that the toll lanes are the direction that traffic infrastructure should go.
“Transportation economists have argued for 50 years that the only systemic solution to congestion is a toll system, and this is a step in the right direction,” said James E. Moore II, director of the USC Transportation Engineering Program.
But though low-income drivers are being offered a one-time $25 credit, some — including USC students — have protested that the tolls are unfair to those who cannot afford to pay more for their drive.
“I don’t use the toll lanes because they are expensive. They are good because they do reduce traffic a lot, but I can’t see myself paying to use them,” said Andrew Minassi, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, who commutes from the South Bay by way of the 110.
Undergraduate Student Government Commuter Senator Vicken Antounian said even with the changes, not all students will use the lanes.
“I take the 110 daily and I don’t use the toll,” Antounian said. “For those who can’t afford it, I think that there are other options, such as taking streets or the 2 Freeway.”
Moore said that the implementation of tolls is actually an ethical decision that forces drivers to think about their impact on the environment.
“Say I get on the freeway at rush hour, and I slow other people up, and I foul the air. All the congestion toll is doing is taking these external costs and making them internal to my choice to travel at the time,” Moore said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the tolls on the 110 and 10 are experiments for Los Angeles County. The results will be evaluated later this year, and if they are deemed successful, the state might switch more carpool lanes to toll lanes.
Commuter Rachel Scott, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said though toll lanes are efficient, she still has reservations.
“At first I was unhappy because it’s taxpayers’ money that built the freeway, and I don’t think that we should have to pay more money to use it. But, I definitely get home and to school faster,” Scott said.
Antounian believes that, overall, the toll lanes will have a positive effect on his constituency.
“I think it’s great that they’ve put in the toll lanes,” Antounian said. “It makes the daily commute a little easier for students.”

Students from the School of Dramatic Arts launched a Facebook page on Monday protesting the alleged firing of two acting professors, Joe Anthony and Doug Tompos. School of Dramatic Arts Dean Madeline Puzo, however, assured students that “no decisions have been made.”
Plenty of students, however, are still concerned. Since its launch, 298 people have “liked” the Facebook page, titled “Protest SDA firing of Joe Anthony & Doug Tompos.”
On the page, students have not only voiced praise for the two teachers, but many are also organizing petitions and protests in their honor.
According to Puzo, the rumors that the two professors had been fired are based on false assumptions about the teaching schedule for next year.
“Two full-time faculty members left the school last year for other jobs, and we are doing a search for candidates to fill those two positions,” Puzo explained.
All full-time faculty members in the Bachelor of Arts acting program are also currently going through routine peer evaluations. The combination of these two processes, according to Puzo, has made the fall teaching schedule unclear.
“We have posted teachers [on the Web Registration system] for a few of the classes,” Puzo said. “We posted what we felt confident about. Somebody — I don’t know who — looked at the registration and made a conclusion that the two teachers had been fired.”
But Puzo assures students that no one has been fired, and she encourages students to approach her with their concerns.
“The three semesters I spent in class with Joe were the highlight of my USC School of Dramatic Arts experience,” said Andrew Johnson, a junior majoring in theatre.“He inspired and prepared me as an artist more than any of my other professors.”
Most theatre students understand that the two weren’t officially fired yet, according to Matthew Solomon, a sophomore majoring in theatre.
“I think what most people think is happening is that [Anthony and Tompos] have been blackballed,” Solomon said, describing how rumors have been circulating that the two professors’ benefits have been taken away and that they were only offered classes that did not fit with their schedules.
Puzo explained that while faculty evaluations were being finalized, Anthony was offered two classes for the fall semester.
“They didn’t work with his schedule,” Puzo said. “But he also wanted to wait until we were in a position to offer him [a full class load]. So clearly, we have already made an overture to Anthony that we were offering him a position to teach here. Whether or not that was enough for him was up to him.”
Anthony and Tompos are both highly respected and popular professors in SDA, as students said classes taught by them regularly have long waitlists.
Richy Storrs, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said that he was inspired by the two teachers and their influence in his life was felt both academically and personally.
“These are the two best teachers  I have ever had in my life,” Storrs said. “They have a really great relationship with students, they have a really fantastic teaching style, they’re both great guys and it all leads to this culmination of the fact that the entire USC theater community really respects them.”
Several students on the Facebook page have threatened to drop the theatre major or leave the university altogether in protest.
But the alleged firing of the two professors is hardly the only concern the students have. Other posts on the page include concerns about where SDA money is spent and other faculty changes.
“One problem that I’ve already run into is the lack of relationship between the School of Dramatic Arts and the School of Cinematic Arts,” said Tina Crnko, a freshman majoring in theatre. “Obviously, these two should be symbiotic.”
Other students, such as Solomon, agree with Crnko that the SDA-SCA relationship is anything but symbiotic.
“I’ve always had an open-door policy,” explained Puzo, who hosts schoolwide events each semester that give students the opportunity to meet with her.
Puzo said she will take the recent sentiments about Anthony and Tompos into consideration but must also consult with her faculty advisers when making employment and scheduling decisions.
“I appreciate [the students’] concern and their affection for these two teachers,” Puzo said. “But I have to listen to the faculty as well as the students when thinking about teachers. I wish the students had felt comfortable to come to me first about this, but they clearly didn’t.”
What is the real story?  Having looked at the facebook page and reading the article I have some questions.
Why are resources being used to recruit new teachers when teachers held in such high regard are being fired?
Is that the best use of funds?
Is anyone in administration looking at objective data? [peer reviews, student reviews, retention rates]
Who does Dean Puzo report to and are they involved in this conversation?
I would love to see an open forum where students, faculty and parents could speak freely and would like to have oversight of this process by someone other than Dean Puzo.
What has been illuminated about the BA acting program is just a small part of the massive problem. I would argue that all programs in SDA are in trouble and this is because of the lack of innovation and direction from the administration headed by Dean Puzo. As a BFA production student I often feel dissatisfied and do not feel like the education that I am getting is worth the $50 000+ I am paying per year. It is extremely disheartening when prospective students ask me what I love about SDA and I respond with hesitation every time. We clearly have fabulous faculty but they are not being valued at all.
I’m thankful for a dramatic arts program at SC so Starbucks will always have plenty of baristas to make my latte.
Hey man, don’t hate on us just because we chose to major in something we actually enjoy.
Extra foam please!
The Dean’s response perfectly illustrates the ‘leadership gap’ in the SDA. She is brushing us off with this response. She is not addressing our central concerns and her leadership style is woefully lacking. She is not listening to us. She is relaying on the fact that we will give up. The issue of Joe and Doug is the tip of the iceberg. the Dean is tokenistic when it comes to listening to us. She has no real interest in our point of view. She is hiding behind her faculty who will carry the can for her decisions. She hasn’t raised any money for the school and we, the BA students, continue to bankroll the graduate programmes. Why isn’t the new dance school part of he SDA? Why did the donor choose to work with the Dean of Music instead of Dean Puzo? The Dean has no idea what is happening in film or tv. Her taste is based upon work she once did in regional theater. A BA degree should include a multiplicity of approaches. I read that in the student brochure an it is why I came here. The Dean wants a single approach and this is not appropriate. She needs to step down so that fresh ideas and fresh leadership can be put in place.
Something is seriously fishy here.
Wait, so if its not true then why is there still a petition?  I agree with Jack H. … something is fishy.
Why does the dean keep lying outright?  There is no way everyone is wrong and only she is telling the truth, thats just statistically wrong.  There has to be more to this.
If Tompos and Anthony are as amazing as all of these students are saying they are, why isn’t the school of Drama bending over backwards to keep them onboard?
You are so right!  They should be doing everything in their power to keep them on!  I can personally say that the theater school would be NOTHING without them.  We have already taken a huge hit without Zane, and Angus (seeing as his comedy of manners class was canceled)

The Undergraduate Student Government will now have a say in tuition decisions following Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson’s decision to allow the USG president to attend a May meeting regarding tuition.
The 2012-13 USG President Mikey Geragos said the USG president will be invited to the Board of Trustees’ Academic Affairs Committee. The USG president will sit in on a presentation made to the committee, which reviews all tuition changes. The president will be allowed to pose questions to the committee and can then relay this information back to his staff.
 
At the commencement of the following school year, the USG president will meet with Garrett and additional members of the USG president’s cabinet to have an in-depth discussion regarding any issues that undergraduates might have with the tuition or any tuition changes.
USG passed a resolution in December requesting that a student representative be able to attend all university administration and Board of Trustee meetings.
USG cited the rising tuition cost as reason for requesting a student representative at the meetings. The tuition rate for university undergraduates rose 70 percent from 2001 to 2011, adding about $1,700 to tuition each year.
“We are very excited that we made progress on this crucial issue,” Geragos said. “Students don’t understand enough about where their tuition dollars are going or how they are being used. As [a] part how they are being used. As [a] part of this university, I think it is the right of the students to be able to understand the financial situation USC is in.”
The new process will allow the president to discuss the tuition with the administration. The president will then make a presentation to the rest of USG to explain what tuition decisions were made by the student government representatives and the administration.
USG senators said the voice of undergraduates will be better represented and more influential in administrative decisions because of the inclusion of student representation in decisions regarding tuition.
Logan Heley, a Greek senator who worked on the project, said the new student-involvement system will encourage students to participate in an issue that affects most students.
“I’m hoping that these new opportunities for student involvement will show students that they can contribute constructively on tuition decisions,” Heley said. “I hope that they can be more involved in the process moving forward.”
When the Senate passes a resolution, that decision does not necessarily go into effect. Rather, the decision stands as a recommendation from undergraduate students. Resolutions are relayed to relevant administrators.
The 2012-13 Greek Senator Matthew Arkfeld, who sponsored the tuition resolution last fall, expressed enthusiasm that this recommendation, in particular, will actually create a difference in the lives of undergraduates.
“USG often faces challenges on getting administrators to actually take action,” Arkfeld said. “However, the administration’s moving forward with this resolution is a great accomplishment, and it is really exciting to see all of my hard work on a resolution I spearheaded finally paying off.”
Geragos is also satisfied that this resolution, which was passed during his term, because it will now directly benefit students and help bridge communication between the undergraduate population and the university administration.
“This is a great step in connecting USC students with the administration on such an important issue,” Geragos said.
Many students were supportive of this next step in gaining student representation on the tuition advisory board.
“We are paying tuition and are often wondering where it goes,” said Jennie Zhang, a junior majoring in English. “It’d be helpful to have an actual student there.”
Other students said the administration’s decision highlights a timely issue and having student opinion on the tuition board will be beneficial.
“It seems like a no-brainer to me,” said John Tarver, a junior majoring in theatre. “I’m sure it would help tremendously to have a voice for the student body when it comes to tuition matters.”

The USC men’s volleyball team might be out of the playoff picture, but it certainly is not backing down as the season comes to a close.
Down and out · 2013 has been a disastrous season for the USC men’s volleyball team, as Wednesday’s loss to UC Santa Barbara brings the team’s record to 6-16, a far cry from 2012’s national runner-up campaign. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The young players were hungry for a taste of the postseason experience as they headed out on the road for their final two games, both against playoff-bound teams. Their first stop was in Santa Barbara on Wednesday, where they took on No. 7 UCSB.
But despite their enthusiasm, the Trojans (6-17) were defeated by a more experienced squad by a score of 25-23, 25-19, 21-25, 25-17.
The Gauchos (15-14, 11-12 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) recently clinched a spot in the MPSF playoffs, but a recent stretch of losses had them clamoring for momentum as they entered Wednesday’s match against USC. Despite being one of the top defensive teams in the nation, UCSB had dropped consecutive matches to BYU and Cal Baptist, but the team was able to regain its stride against USC.
The Trojans had a number of opportunities to take control of Wednesday’s match early on, but they tapered off near the end of the first two sets. Both teams hit poorly at the start of the match, but six crucial aces from the Gauchos gave them the advantage they needed in sets one and two.
“Our hitting percentage wasn’t very good but we were making stops and we held them to a pretty low percentage as well,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “Defensively, we did a nice job, but we made too many service errors and just dug ourselves too big of a hole.”
Though the Trojans were able to contain the Gaucho’s best player, Dylan Davis, they had a difficult time overcoming the duo of outside hitter Austin Kingi and middle blocker Evan Licht. The two combined for seven aces and 18 digs and gave UCSB a significant advantage in the match.
“Their team usually goes as Dylan Davis goes,” Ferguson said. “And we held Davis to .200 [hitting percentage], which is great, but we couldn’t stop their other outside hitters.”
But the USC squad showed some signs of life in third set. Despite falling behind early, the Trojans surged, riding a wave of strong hitting to an 11-5 run and a sizable lead. The Gauchos put up a strong fight and evened the score four times, but the Trojans pulled through and were able to take the set.
It looked as though the Trojans success would continue into the fourth set when they jumped out to an early lead, but this time the Gauchos responded. The combination of strong serving by UCSB and atrocious hitting from USC gave the Gauchos all they needed to win the set and the match.
“In the third set, we did a great job of bouncing back,” Ferguson said. “It was the best execution I saw throughout the match, but in the fourth we just fell behind and made too many attack errors.”
Once again, the Trojans were victims of their own poor night at the net. They hit a dismal .135 and were overpowered by the Gauchos strong defense. Though the Trojans were able to keep pace on digs, they were out-blocked by ten and out-served by six aces. UCSB simply outplayed the Trojans en route to their 15th win of the season.
Though the rest of the team appeared somber after another loss, Ferguson was happy to see some of his younger players step up to the challenge. Freshman middle blocker Josh Kirchner put forth an especially encouraging showing, along with some other Trojan youngsters.
“Josh Kirchner had a fantastic night tonight, he hit great and he served really well,” Ferguson said. “[Robert] Feathers was okay, [Austin] Rysyk came in and sparked us pretty good off the bench and J.B. Green had some good digs for us. So I was happy with those performances.”
The Trojans might not be headed to the playoffs, the younger players’ performances against the Gauchos provide some hope for the future. As one of the youngest teams in the NCAA, the USC men’s volleyball team seems to be poised for a few impressive seasons down the road.
The Trojans close out the season tomorrow with a rivalry matchup against UCLA. The match will be played at the Bruins’ newly refurbished Pauley Pavilion starting at 7 p.m.
good comment STEVE.  I am very SAD as well.  I believe we have talent, but it is lack of chemistry and experience is killing us.  Service errors, and losing our INTENSITY at key moments in sets.  I agree Murphy and TONY were sensational in 1st year.  Coach must hit recruiting hard.  We should NOT have fallen off this much.
I like our players……we really miss McKibbin’s leadership and losing Tony and Steve at MB to graduation was huge.
FIGHT ON,
beat da ‘ruins
Not backing down because they won one set against a .500 team. Season’s end and the Coach has no
set lineup or figured out what to do when the set starts to get away from the team. They are young which
is a poor excuse for lack of talent. The Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli’s were good from their first year in school.
Tired of all these players from Hawaii, a good international player is needed. Look at Cal Baptist.

They are easily downloadable, cheap — if not free — and highly portable for those settling in on a long plane ride. And though no one’s quite sure when they first arrived, e-books have confounded the publishing world since they first reached mainstream success in 2007, when Amazon unveiled its Kindle e-reader.
For bibliophiles, the changing literary landscape poses a series of uncomfortable questions about the future of reading. (What happens when a reader’s digital library is erased? How are starving authors expected to support themselves?). What will happen to the relationship between the reader and the printed page?
As technology brings more of the written word to the digital screen, these frightening questions warrant well-considered answers.
On Monday, author Scott Turow published a well-written article in The New York Times titled “The Slow Death of the American Author.” Turow, who is the president of the Authors Guild and expects to publish his 10th original novel this year, is perhaps one of the most qualified writers to explore the drawbacks of e-publishing and does so with remarkable poetic style.
Like several writers wary of e-book popularity, Turow cites the reasons why literary culture is so important in America — and it’s not so he can preserve his own status as a bestselling author.
“Authors practice one of the few professions directly protected in the Constitution, which instructs Congress ‘to promote the progress of Science and the useful Arts by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries,’” Turow writes. “The idea is that a diverse literary culture, created by authors whose livelihoods, and thus independence, can’t be threatened, is essential to democracy. That culture is now at risk.”
Turow goes on to describe the lessening value of copyright protections for published works, growing trends in book piracy and the problematic nature of e-book lending in public libraries, all to publicize the negative effects that the electronic reading market has had on the lives of authors. Though none of his arguments are new per se, Turow does a fantastic job of compiling viable concerns that fans of the printed page might have after the recent surge in e-book sales.
Still, what’s most interesting about Turow’s article and recent exposés on the horrors of digital reading can be boiled down to a single question: Will technological advancements affect the personal interaction between a reader and a beloved novel?
According to a 2013 article on Publishing Unleashed, e-books accounted for 22 percent of the publishing market by the second quarter of 2012. Upon a first read, this might not seem like much, but according to that same article, this statistic marks a 49.5 percent increase in adult book sales from January 2011 to January 2012, which is quite a large jump considering that e-books hit a major boom just six years ago. In response to such rapidly growing numbers, Pricewaterhouse Coopers’ Global Entertainment and Media Outlook told paidContent that it expects e-books to make up 50 percent of the U.S. trade book market by 2016 (see Daily Trojan graphic below). It would seem that, like it or not, e-books are here to stay.
To be honest, I’m just as skeptical of e-books as the next person. I make a point of visiting Barnes & Noble at least every other month, buying all of my required readings in a print format and laughing at my Kindle-loving friends whenever the battery goes dead on their e-readers.
But at the same time, I’m also inspired by the durability of reading in American and Western culture. Though e-books might seem like the death of the novel as we know it, it’s important to remember that trends in literature and publishing have always been unstable. Mega bookstores, such as Barnes & Noble or Borders (which went out of business on Sept. 18, 2011), only appeared in the early ’80s, despite how old and familiar they might seem to today’s generation. And before these companies, there were smaller, family-owned book shops, which fizzled out in the wake of such grand competition.
Amazon, which was founded in 1994 and currently holds the largest share of the e-book market, only represents the latest development in reading trends. Because of Amazon’s ability to sell used books for less than a dollar, the company quickly became the largest seller of online books before diversifying and selling other products. Now, five years after its launch of the first successful e-reader, Amazon is giving major publishers a run for their money. But don’t fear, readers. This too shall pass.
I’m not saying that e-readers are a passing trend or that Amazon hasn’t permanently changed the publishing industry, but we should keep in mind that books have always adapted to meet the needs of the reading public. The publication of written stories has evolved from the stone tablet and the papyrus scroll, to the handwritten manuscript and, finally, to the modern printed — or digital — novel. Though we’re unsure of where books might be moving next, the evolution of publishing will most certainly be in the best interest of those who love reading. And as we navigate this evolution, issues like copyright and the rights of the author will fall into place.
So for now, just settle back into the bathtub with your favorite paperback or curl up in an armchair to download the latest New York Times bestseller. After all, what’s most important is the intimate relationship between readers and the stories that have the potential to change their lives.

It is a story that embodies the melting pot of American culture. It has been told time and time again. But this version of the musical West Side Story, back by popular demand at the Pantages Theatre for a limited engagement, is perhaps the most authentic retelling of the classic cross-cultural love story.
Clash of cultures · Unlike in the original musical, this version of West Side Story incorporates more authentic elements, such as having the Puerto Rican characters speak in their native tongue for about 10 percent of the script. Audiences across the country have responded favorably to the more dynamic Latin flavor that the new revival features. – Courtesy of Carol Rosegg
“I think that this story is grittier, darker, in the sense that you first see the gangs covered in bruises,” said Theo Lencicki, who plays gang leader Riff. “We are from the streets — the gangs in the original [production] maybe looked more out of Leave it to Beaver.”
The musical, which follows the Romeo and Juliet-esque love story of Maria and Tony — who associate with rival gangs, the Jets, a working-class white gang, and the Sharks, first-generation Puerto Ricans, in 1950s New York City — promotes a message of love that survives despite bigotry and hate.
Following a tradition of recent Broadway revivals such as Hair and South Pacific, Lencicki said writer Arthur Laurents’ 2009 re-design of West Side Story has made a conscious effort to incorporate more realistic elements in the story to make the production feel more contemporary.
For Lencicki, what stands out most is having the Puerto Rican characters speak in their native tongue for a portion of the musical.
“It’s only 10 percent of the show, but it really enhances and distinguishes it,” Lencicki said.
Though Lencicki does not speak Spanish or Portuguese, he said having actors speak in different languages has created a bond with the castmembers — many of whom are of Latin American descent.
“Even if we aren’t of Latin American descent, watching them enjoy the dynamic has allowed us to understand each other more and feel included,” Lencicki said.
Lencicki has noted that so far, audiences across the country have responded favorably to the more dynamic Latin flavor of the production, though some regions have picked up on the changes more than others.
“When we were in New Mexico the audience had a lot of Spanish-speaking people, so some of the jokes that don’t normally land in say, Boise, Idaho were getting a lot of laughter,” Lencicki said.
For example, in the scene where the female lead Maria (MaryJoanna Grisso) says in Portugese that she wants her dress to be lower, Grisso’s words brought the house down.
“Even though a regular audience can see she’s lowering her dress, the language and dialogue gave it even more flavor for those who understood what they were saying,” Lencicki said.
There is also an emphasis on physicality in the revisal, which gives the musical a tougher feel. At times, though, the intense dances can be demanding for the actors, with some performers even suffering physical setbacks.
“This show is very physical, very difficult for the body,” Lencicki said. “When someone gets injured it’s not an ideal situation, but the cast has really banded together welcoming [substitutes], and that has been a really great thing.”
For Lencicki, it has been an honor, albeit a challenging one, to play Riff.
“The singing, the acting, the dancing — to be able to be cast in the role to show all three of those; it’s a dream role for any male performer,” Lencicki said. “To do all three is a blessing.”
Lencicki said that when he plays Riff, he wants to humanize the face of the Sharks.
“He’s such a strong character: stubborn, a leader,” Lencicki said. “But through his relationship with Tony you get to see more of his adolescent side, rather than the kid that grew up too fast.”
The Scranton, Pa., native said he carries a special connection to his character, whom he surprisingly finds a lot in common with.
“There’s so many relatable things,” Lencicki said, “from being from a west side part of a city, growing up with the camaraderie of playing sports and now, dancing with these guys every night. This bond we have that’s so strong from acting and reacting [together] on the stage, I feel like I get Riff’s camaraderie [with the Jets].”
He observed that Director David Saint and Laurents have brought new life to the production.
“It’s been great to work with these creative people,” Lencicki said. “We’re doing such a classic thing and affecting an audience, and in turn affecting ourselves and pushing our limits.”
Whether you’ve seen the show before or are new to the musical, Lencicki noted that the power of the storyline will still move you.
“The choreography, the original music is absolutely beautiful,” he said. “I think if you just let yourself go you’ll find yourself crying with Maria when the curtain closes.”
 
West Side Story runs at the Pantages Theatre through Sunday, April 14. Tickets start at $25. For more information visit westsidestoryontour.com.

On the surface, the detective play The Innocence of Father Brown seems like it would follow the formulaic “cat and mouse” plot. Instead, the production, which premiered March 30 at the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena, turns the who-done-it into a fine-tuned examination of justice, religion, reason, truth and guilt.

Originally brought to life in a volume of 12 stories written by G.K. Chesterton in 1911, Father Brown, at first glance, appears to be a harmless priest living in London, but his powers of deductive reasoning bring to mind  the master of mystery, Sherlock Holmes.
Though Holmes is an aloof and eccentric character — seemingly too smart for the lowly plebeians that make up society — Father Brown regards humanity with great interest and humility (his unpretentious bowler hat and spectacles even serve as the outward manifestation of his modesty).
Playwright Patrick Rieger’s adaptation stays faithful to the core of Chesterton’s stories, delivering plot twists and accusations that serve as a way for the audience to re-examine the crime and who the culprit could be. Chesterton and Rieger, however, offer the audience a deeper layer than many stories of this genre; the more the audience attempts to follow Father Brown’s thought process and make astute observations trying to deduce who-done-it, the more they also begin to recognize the deeper messages that Chesterton is trying to convey.
The Innocence of Father Brown is aptly titled, as it is this innocence that is called into question throughout the entire play.
At one point, the protagonist tells the chief of police that though many people are scared of the devil because of how different he is from everyone else, Father Brown is terrified of the similarities he sees between himself and the devil.  Because, by thinking like a criminal, Father Brown is able to so deftly and remarkably catch the criminal he and the police pursue.
As Rieger so profoundly depicts, Father Brown is not the only character whose innocence is called into question. What of the criminal mastermind-turned lovesick private eye who spends five years paying his dues in jail? Or the police chief whose determination to catch the criminal leaves him blind to mercy? How is one to react to the death of the town drunkard who ruined the lives of everyone with whom he came in contact?
Rieger artistically throws all of these questions and more at the audience.
The small and unobtrusive set design creates an atmosphere that parallels the profound and introspective nature of the play. A few triptych panels serve as doors in some scenes or as walls in others and were accompanied by only a multipurpose table and few chairs. This choice of design allows the audience to focus on the characters and their moral development rather than getting distracted by any extraneous props or costumes.
One’s personal connection to the play and its characters is fostered by the fact that the theater itself is charmingly intimate. The cast consisted of only seven actors, but there are 16 roles dispersed among them; some actors were called to play up to four different characters throughout the play. The cast of Little Candle Productions, Rieger and the directors Allison Darby Gorjian and Betsy Roth display their immense skills in their respective positions. The character switches are clear, the costumes are distinct and breaks in the stories are obvious. Blake Walker, Brandon Parrish and Adam Daniel Elliott faithfully take on the roles of Father Brown, Flambeau and Chief Inspector Valentin, respectively, throughout the entire play. The other actors embodied each of their multiple characters with equal fidelity.
One strong example of an actor playing multiple roles is Terrance Robinson, who initially portrays a reverend so devoted to God that he momentarily forgets his own earthly roots. Robinson then transitions into a self-named prophet of the god Apollo, a character with questionable motives. Robinson concludes the play by taking on the role of a submissive and loyal butler. This versatility makes him stand out, as he brings each character to life.
Though the stories were written originally in 1911, Chesterton’s ingenuity and profundity are prevalent today. The adaptation takes simple issues — such as good or bad, right or wrong — and makes them nuanced issues. Yet despite the complex heart of the play,  The Innocence of Father Brown manages to maintain a light and entertaining atmosphere — creating an engaging night of “who-done-it” with a deeeper philosophical center.
 
The Innocence of Father Brown runs at the Fremont Centre Theatre through Sunday, April 28. General admission is $25.

Following a historic weekend at the San Diego Classic in which it brought home three trophies, the USC women’s rowing team earned a unanimous No. 1 ranking in the latest Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association/US Rowing Coaches Top 25 poll. It is the first time that USC has claimed the top spot in the rankings since 2007.

In the season-opening race, the Women of Troy were dominant. USC claimed grand-final victories in three different varsity divisions and won the coveted Jessop-Whittier Cup for the third consecutive year.
USC’s second varsity eight won the second Jackie Ann Stitt Hungness Trophy in school history, while the team’s varsity four boat took home the Karen Plumleigh Cortney Cup to cap the momentous day.
Virginia, which was ranked No. 1 entering the weekend, dropped to No. 3, while Cal remained at No. 2. USC leapfrogged three other schools after sitting at the No. 6 spot prior to the weekend’s races. Ohio State and Princeton round out the top five at No. 4 and No. 5, respectively.
Three other Pac-12 schools cracked the top 10, with Washington, UCLA and Stanford ranking six through eight, respectively.
Last season, USC finished at No. 6 in the CRCA/US Rowing Coaches poll, with Virginia finishing the season as the top school.
The Women of Troy will be back in action at the Lack Natoma Invitational in Gold River, Calif., on April 20.

Tuesday marked the latest chapter in a season full of bumps and bruises for USC’s baseball team. In a hard-fought 6-4 loss to No. 4 Cal State Fullerton, the Trojans were reminded that no matter how much they tried to overcome countless obstacles, 2013 just wasn’t going to be their year.
Not that this should be a surprise to anyone who has followed the program in recent years. USC hasn’t reached the College World Series since 2001 and hasn’t posted a winning record since 2005. Barring an improbable second-half run, USC should fall below .500 once again this season. To be blunt, the Trojans should expect to lose to Cal State Fullerton, a perennial national powerhouse.
Actually, hold that thought for a moment — let’s examine that.
Why should USC expect to lose to a school like Cal State Fullerton in baseball? There must be a key difference between the schools that gives the Titans an edge. What could it be?
Location can’t be the answer. The schools are located roughly 35 miles from each other and, as a result, they compete for the same local high school players in the miles-deep talent pool that is Southern California.
Program tradition plays a big factor in recruiting players; perhaps that is the key difference. Fullerton has a storied baseball history, to be sure, with four national championships and 52 alumni that have played in Major League Baseball.
But USC blows both of those numbers away. The Trojans are the all-time leaders in both categories, with 12 national championships and a staggering 106 players sent to the MLB, both figures more than double Fullerton’s output.
So historical prestige is now thrown out as well. Could financial security be the key? Hardly. Few schools in America can rival USC’s deep private-school pockets, with the seemingly endless line of well-to-do alumni just dying to throw money at the school. Fullerton, on the other hand, has suffered budget cuts for the past several years and could only dream of having the resources USC does.
That rules out finances as Fullerton’s secret edge. Could academic prestige be the deal breaker? U.S. News & World Report ranked USC at No. 24 in its 2013 rankings. Cal State Fullerton? Let’s just say they are a little further down the list. I don’t mean to disrespect Fullerton as an academic institution; both of my parents are proud Titan alumni (they are also the ones currently paying my tuition). But I can say with some certainty that the levels of academic rigor of USC and Fullerton are beyond comparison.
But that still leaves us without an answer to the million-dollar question. Maybe an iconic head coach is the reason for Fullerton’s recent dominance over USC? The Trojans had their greatest success under the legendary Rod Dedeaux, who led the program to 11 national championships and is a member of the College Baseball Hall of Fame. Fullerton’s version of Dedeaux would be Augie Garrido, who led the Titans to three national championships in 19 seasons at the helm.
But Garrido left the program for good after the 1996 season, and since then the school has had three different head coaches. George Horton made six College World Series appearances in 11 seasons, with one national championship in 2004, before leaving for Oregon in 2007. Dave Serrano was 175-73 during his four seasons as head coach, with one College World Series appearance. Current head coach Rick Vanderhook is in his second season as head coach and now has a 65-25 record after Tuesday’s win over USC.
The point of this is that it doesn’t seem to matter all that much who is calling the shots for the Titans. They always win. In fact, since the school began playing baseball in 1975, Fullerton has never finished a season with a losing record. It’s as if the school was destined to succeed at baseball, circumstances be damned.
For the same reasons that USC Athletic Director Pat Haden says USC should have a “relevant” basketball program, the same can be said double for USC’s baseball program. It has all of the same benefits going for it, with a huge dosage of historical tradition heaped on top. It couldn’t be in a better position to succeed, which makes its decade-long struggle all the more puzzling.
I understand why Haden has basketball at the top of his agenda at the moment. He just made a big splash hire, and he needs it to be a successful one. USC’s basketball program has never enjoyed an era of significance, let alone dominance, and Haden is right in believing that the time is now to change that.
But the Trojan baseball program should be treated with a similar sense of urgency. I have to believe that if USC really wanted to succeed in baseball, it could. There are just too many resources at the school’s disposal for the program to continue to fail. Haden would be wise to make baseball item No. 2 on his agenda, if not No. 1, because if he doesn’t, the gap between USC and schools such as Fullerton, Long Beach State and UCLA will continue to grow.
But back to the original question: What does Fullerton have that USC doesn’t? Your guess is as good as mine.
 
“Inside the 20s” runs on Thursdays. To comment on this story, email Nick at nselbe@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Mike Garrett, Pat Haden, and Don Winston are clueless when it comes to finding a head coach. The athletic
dept. is cheap with resources for the baseball program. You let John Savage go to Irvine to start up their
baseball program who leaves for ucla which now becomes a national contender. George Horton goes to
Oregon from Fullerton to re-establish their entry into the baseball scene becoming another national contender
in a couple of years after being dormant. USC twiddles their thumbs for the last eight years while every Southern
California university passes them by if going in the carpool lane. It is a complete disregard for the great tradition
built by Rod Dedeaux, and even somewhat held onto by Mike Gillespie in his better years.

Sophomore tennis star Sabrina Santamaria has accomplished quite a bit during her young, wildly successful career, and this week saw yet another achievement added to an already impressive list. Santamaria was named the Pac-12’s player of the week on Tuesday for the third time this season after impressive performances last weekend against the Arizona schools.
Loaded · Sophomore Sabrina Santamaria is the highest ranked of four USC players who are ranked in the top 60 of the ITA’s current rankings. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Against the Sun Devils, the Women of Troy pulled off a 7-0 sweep to hand ASU its first conference loss of the season, moving USC into sole possession of first place. In that match, the No. 2-ranked Santamaria defeated ASU’s No. 23 Jacqueline Cako 6-3, 6-3. Santamaria also was strong in doubles, pairing with senior Danielle Lao for the first time this season against ASU. The duo was ahead 6-5 when the match was suspended after USC had secured the doubles point.
Against Arizona, Santamaria knocked off another ranked opponent in Arizona’s No. 64-ranked Lacey Smyth. Santamaria was pushed in the second set but won by a score of 6-3, 7-6 to clinch the win for USC. In doubles, Santamaria teamed with Lao again, and this time the pair cruised to an 8-1 victory over Arizona’s Smyth and Shayne Austin.
On the year, Santamaria is a stellar 28-3 overall in singles matches and a perfect 15-0 in dual matches. She is also a flawless 26-0 in doubles matches, teaming with Lao and her primary partner, junior Kaitlyn Christian. The duo of Santamaria and Christian is currently ranked No. 1 in the country and has won back-to-back ITA national indoor doubles championships.
Santamaria capped of an impressive freshman campaign by hauling in a plethora of impressive awards, including a spot on the ITA All-American singles and doubles teams. She and Christian also won the Pac-12 Doubles Championship and were named the Pac-12 Doubles Team of the Year. This season has seen an extension of that success, as her individual ranking is at a career high, and she has teamed with Christian to win both the ITA national indoors championship as well as the ITA/Riviera All-American doubles championship.
Santamaria is the sixth different USC player to win the Pac-12’s weekly honor this season. The Women of Troy will continue their quest for a conference championship this weekend when they take on Oregon on Sunday, April 14 in Eugene, Ore.

In his introductory press conference last week, new USC basketball head coach Andy Enfield said he was looking for an assistant coach with a Southern California background to improve local recruiting. He now has two.
On Wednesday, Fox Sports reported that San Diego State assistant coach Tony Bland accepted USC’s offer to become associate head coach. He joins Jason Hart, lured away from his assistant role at Pepperdine, as the first two members of Enfield’s coaching staff.
Bland had been an assistant coach at San Diego State for the last two seasons. He attended Westchester High in Los Angeles and then played at Syracuse before transferring to SDSU, where he played two seasons under current Aztecs’ head coach Steve Fisher.
Bland was known for his recruiting prowess while at SDSU, and, in 2012, played a major role in recruiting the program’s first ever five-star recruit, Winston Shepard.
“Tony Bland is the best young recruiter on the West Coast,” CBS Sports’ Jeff Borzello tweeted on Saturday, when rumors of Enfield’s offer began to surface.
Bland will receive an increase in salary with the position. He was paid $120,000 annually at SDSU, but will make at least double that at USC, per multiple media reports. As associate head coach, he is behind only Enfield in his role, while at SDSU he was behind associate head coach Brian Dutcher.
Hart played point guard in the NBA for nine seasons on nine different teams, most recently with the Minnesota Timberwolves. After his last season in 2010, Hart coached at Taft High School in Los Angeles and in Amateur Athletic Union basketball before being hired as an assistant at Pepperdine in May 2012.
“They are getting a first class person, family man & hard worker. Much respect!” tweeted Pepperdine head basketball coach Marty Wilson on Monday, after news of Hart’s move to USC broke.
Hart attended Inglewood High School, located just 20 minutes from USC, as well as Westchester High School before playing college basketball at Syracuse. Hart became the school’s all-time leader in steals and was second among assist leaders. He earned All-Big East first-team honors during his senior season and was named as a member of Syracuse’s All-Century basketball team.
Bland and Hart were teammates under legendary Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim in the 1998-99 and 1999-00 seasons.
For Enfield, a Pennsylvania native and Johns Hopkins alumnus with East Coast ties, the move equips the team with proven assistants and respected recruiters with deep Southern California roots. That can only work in the new head coach’s favor when trying to recruit      top-tier local talent in the Los Angeles area.
Enfield may still add to his staff in the coming weeks. Last week, former interim head coach Bob Cantu announced via his Twitter account that he would not be returning next season.
How is Hart better situated that Bob Cantu who was with USC for twelve years building up relationships with
local high school coaches? Maybe being Caucasian puts him at a disadvantage with the local talent of today
while both Bland and Hart are African-American.

Lawmakers need to do more to restrict other kinds of guns and ammunition, as well as more strict background checks.
Alexa Youssefian | Daily Trojan
The new law, which goes into effect next year, will limit high-capacity magazines to 10 rounds, expand the assault weapons ban in the state, expand background check programs and place restrictions on guns that will do little to stop violence.
In limiting high-capacity magazines, lawmakers argued, shooter Adam Lanza would have had fewer bullets — causing him to reload more often. Therefore, each of those breaks in time to reload could have been a potential opportunity for someone to disarm him during the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, Gov. Dannel Malloy told NPR.
During the Sandy Hook shooting, Lanza reloaded his Bushmaster AR-15 (a civilian version of the military M16, the gun carried by American soldiers in the Vietnam War) a total of six times, according to Businessweek. Lanza already had to reload, and he still killed 20 children. A few more reloads would not have done much good.
Expanding a ban on assault weapons, though a step in the right direction, is not enough to stop killers. According to The Atlantic, mass murders use assault weapons in 40 percent of rampages, but assault weapons constitute less than 2 percent of total gun crime in the U.S. Placing bans on assault rifles will do little to stop gun crime. Furthermore, 75 percent of rampages involve handguns, yet the Connecticut laws have not placed limits on those types of firearms, even though handguns also make up 72 percent of gun violence.
Placing tougher background checks to screen for those suffering from a mental illness is similarly flawed. According to complete records of all 62 mass shootings from 1982-2012, only two of the shooters were previously diagnosed with a mental illness and/or had any sort of psychological issue. The new laws would not screen out a majority of the shooters in these incidents. This law will do little to deter the mentally ill from perpetrating gun crime.
Overall, the new law is designed to prevent more mass killings, but in reality it does less to prevent the overall amount of American gun crime. In that 1982-2012 period, massacres caused the deaths of 513 individuals. Guns kill more than 30,000 Americans every year.
Making the rare massacre a bit less deadly does not address the overall problem of gun violence in this nation — the new law is simply not enough.
Dan Morgan-Russell is a freshman majoring in international relations global business.
 
Instead of focusing on banning weapons, lawmakers should try to implement gun safety education.
Alexa Youssefian | Daily Trojan
It’s been said time and time again: Guns don’t kill people, people kill people — and it’s much easier for a person to commit such a crime with a gun. People kill people with knives. People kill people with cars. One can limit the number of magazines and bullets available for purchase, but that won’t necessarily stop the killing.
Instead of attempting to deprive American citizens of their Second Amendment right, the United States government should focus on the importance of education. Many were horrified when ABC News reported that Texas parents had begun to host birthday parties at a family-friendly gun range. And yes, at first it might sound strange; however, by educating children about guns at a young age, they will have the chance to realize just how dangerous guns can be and learn to respect them appropriately.
Adolescents are often in front of a screen shooting at people through a video game or watching someone take down a school. And while video games and news media aren’t the only factors to blame, one must admit that it plays a huge role.
On April 9, a 6-year-old Toms River boy died after his 4-year-old playmate grabbed a loaded gun, presumably from one of his parents’ belongings, and shot him, according to CBS News. How did the boy know where the gun was? Why did he think it was a play toy? By removing the “fun” from gun violence, the country might just have a chance to combat it.
In addition, mental illness isn’t as big of a factor, compared to bad education. The government cannot stigmatize mental illness to the point of saying that anyone with a gun will commit mass murder. There are plenty of those living with a mental illness or disorder who have the capability of not doing so.
Obviously, the munitions store where the 4-year-old’s mother or father bought the gun didn’t think to do a detailed check of their young child.
Lawmakers can’t take away the people’s right to protect themselves without addressing the main issue: People use guns improperly because our country does not value gun safety education.
This issue is one that is currently dividing the country. It seems as if Republicans will rightly refuse to back down on their Second Amendment wishes and Democrats will always demand more stringent laws. Both sides need to compromise — and by pushing the need for gun education at a young age, both parties just might be appeased.

The shooting at Sandy Hook was incredibly rare. If the state had done nothing, the likelihood of the event repeating in the state within ten years was closer to zero percent than five percent. I doubt any new law has the capacity to make a statistically significant change. 
1) Only people that follow the legislature learn about new laws
2) New laws are announced in the media a handful of times
3) Mentally ill people don’t live in the same reality zone as the rest of us
4) Criminals don’t check law books before doing what they want to do
5) There are so many laws already weighing down society, one more is unlikely to make a difference
6) Our prisons are already full, so any new prisoners will mean that old prisoners must be set free

Thank goodness for the NBA and MLB. If those two leagues weren’t there to take the place of March Madness, I probably would not have been able to get out of bed Tuesday morning.
But who am I kidding? How can anything possibly replace one of the greatest NCAA Basketball Tournaments in recent memory? In fact, the entire college basketball season was more entertaining than any I’ve ever seen, thanks to the parity that existed across nearly every conference.
After Kentucky ran the table last year, losing just two games on their way to an easy championship, many feared that the sport was headed in the wrong direction. It appeared that mid-major programs would fall out of relevance, as an era of “super teams” took shape, with top recruits joining together at powerhouse schools like Duke and Kentucky. It appeared that mid-major programs would fall out of relevance. This, obviously, was not the case.
Instead of falling out of the picture, the smaller conferences stepped up to the challenge and made a remarkable impact on this season’s outcome. In fact, Gonzaga’s rise to No. 1 in the AP poll was the first time since 2004 that a school from a mid-major conference ended the season ranked first.
The success did not end there. Once in the tournament, these lesser-praised schools exceeded everyone’s expectations, save their own. The championship may have eventually boiled down to Louisville and Michigan, but no one can deny the role played by some of the smaller schools. Here are my favorites:
5. Temple
This pick feels like a cheat but I still have to give them credit. The Atlantic 10 may not play like a mid-major conference, but I will continue to praise it as long as it’s referred to as such. Temple took out a mediocre North Carolina State squad before giving Indiana a major scare. They may not have made the Sweet 16, but they exposed enough of the Hoosiers’ flaws to allow for Syracuse to send Indiana packing the next round.
4. Harvard
While calling the Ivy League a mid-major is a bit generous, the point remains the same: Harvard exceeded expectations. Knocking off a New Mexico team that many (including myself) expected to go far, the Crimson’s upset left brackets busted left and right. As if those Harvard kids need something else to brag about…
3. La Salle
Another representative from the A-10, the Explorers may have had an easier ride to the Sweet 16 than others (facing a soft 4 seed and a 12), but they had to go through an extra game to get there. It seems like there is always one team from a play-in game who can continue their success in the following rounds, and La Salle was this year’s edition. Unfortunately for them, they ran up against an even hotter mid-major school and finished their season in the Sweet 16.
 
2. Florida Gulf Coast
The Eagles were the story of the tournament, rising from safety school to trending topic in a matter of four days. FGCU’s fast-paced offense and propensity for spectacular plays earned them the moniker “Dunk City”, and allowed them to knock off the powerhouse Georgetown Hoyas. Their torrid run was stopped by Florida in the regional semifinals, but not before they earned their place in the history books as the first 15 seed to advance to the Sweet 16.
 
1. Wichita State
Coming in first is Cinderella herself. Representing the Missouri Valley Conference, the Shockers strung together an unprecedented run of victories en route to the second Final Four appearance in school history. A national semifinal loss to Louisville knocked them out of the tournament, but not before they made a name for themselves and showed that mid-major schools aren’t just keeping pace with the big guys, but gaining. Fast.
