Almost every family has been touched by Alzheimer’s, according to Executive Chairman and Founder of the CTonAm Group Daniel Epstein. If they haven’t, Epstein said, their next door neighbor has.
Epstein witnessed his identical twin brother suffer from Alzheimer’s for 15 years before passing away as a result of the disease. Driven by this experience, Epstein committed to progressing Altzheimer’s research and making a difference in the medical world.
The Epstein Family Foundation gave USC and UC San Diego a joint $50 million donation in January to continue Alzheimer’s research and advance the search for treatments and a possible cure. The gift is to be split evenly, with USC and UCSD each receiving $25 million to propel their Alzheimer’s research efforts.
Besides Epstein’s connections as an alum of USC and a resident of San Diego, Epstein said the donation was motivated by the innovative Alzheimer’s research done at USC and UCSD. The donation aims to open up opportunities to discover new solutions building off of past research and innovation, Epstein said.
“[USC and UCSD]’s approach is something they call ‘Powder for Pennies,’ where they’re trying and studying repurposing existing drugs for use in Alzheimer’s treatment,” Epstein said. “So, if there’s [a drug] already existing out there … and has been used for treatments of other diseases, there is a possibility to building and finding something that would have applicability in Alzheimer’s.”
Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at USC, said he believes the gift will accelerate the development of effective treatments for the disease and help the program fulfill its goals. These initiatives include developing methods to improve the diversity of clinical trial populations, developing new technology and enhancing infrastructure for sharing data.
“The entire field of Alzheimer’s disease drug development has been plagued by a problem with its clinical trials … People who volunteer to participate in clinical trials are typically a very homogeneous group: highly educated whites,” Aisen said. “Clearly, we need a representative population, and so this gift is going to support our work in outreach to communities, particularly Black and Latino communities. It’s going to support the development of a more inclusive trial.”
In addition to diversifying trials and refining technology, both institutions aim to gain an improved understanding of Alzheimer’s causes, which may give more insight into the steps that can be taken to prevent or cure it, Epstein said. 
Dr. Howard Feldman, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, said he considers the Epstein Family donation as the opportunity of a generation, creating the ability to completely alter and improve Alzheimer’s disease treatment development. 
Feldman, a professor of neurosciences, director of Alzheimer’s Disease and Cooperative Study and dean of Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Research at UCSD’s School of Medicine, said that one of the ways the university aims to do this is with a Gene Therapy Program, which will target and work with families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s.
“[Successful gene therapy] has not been used in Alzheimer’s disease to date,” Feldman said. “Our aspirational goal is to advance an array of gene therapy approaches supported through the Collaboration to be able to test the most promising therapy in persons with mutations of the presenilin gene, which causes the disease, within the next five years.”
Epstein said he saw value in splitting his foundation’s $50 million donation between both universities to encourage collaboration in exchanging and building upon research and ideas.
According to Inside Higher Ed, in 2019, USC agreed to pay $50 million to settle a legal dispute with UCSD. UCSD alleged that Southern California illegally planned to take top Alzheimer’s researchers from their department. Aisen said there is no correlation between the current donation and previous difficulties, and that the donation will encourage greater collaboration between the two universities.
Feldman said that he believes a collaborative effort will produce even greater effects in Alzheimer’s studies, as having faculty expertise from USC and UCSD while developing clinical trials will enhance this process.
“UC San Diego and USC are research powerhouses in the field of Alzheimer’s research, so this gift allows us to leverage our respective strengths for even greater research impact,” Feldman said. “The goal of the Epstein Family Alzheimer’s Research Collaboration, made possible by this donation, is to expedite the discovery of better treatments and, ultimately, a cure for Alzheimer’s disease.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Daniel Epstein was an employee at UCSD. Epstein has not been employed at the university. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In the midst of the 2020 coronavirus lockdown’s second anniversary, USC has chronicled a long history of responses to the outbreak, including decisions about online classes, Trojan Check, tuition increases and treatment of international students.
One of the University’s first measures responded to the initial surge in coronavirus cases by moving classes online for a three-day testing period beginning March 11, 2020, to test remote capabilities. The University later extended the online period, with classes and campus life not fully returning to an in-person capacity until Fall 2021. 
Early in July 2020, new implications arose for international students and their ability to remain in the United States following the release of a federal government directive that required international students to take at least one in-person class to maintain their visa status, long before most in-person classes had returned across the nation’s colleges. Immediately meeting public and institutional controversy, USC responded by filing a lawsuit, alongside 20 other universities in the country, against the policy.
Grace Zhang, a junior majoring in electrical engineering and computational neuroscience from China, said  the news about the policy had initially panicked her until hearing from the Viterbi School of Engineering about plans for hybrid courses to comply with the visa requirement.
“Particularly, I remember the [government] policy coming out and me having a heart attack about it,” Zhang said. “But I remember our school of engineering reaching out to us and saying that it’s not going to be a problem for undergrads.”
In a schoolwide email on July 8, 2020, Viterbi Dean Yannis Yortsos stated that 40% of the school’s Fall 2020 classes would be offered in a hybrid fashion to help F-1 and M-1 visa holders.
A majority of classes continued online during the 2020-21 school year — other than labs and performance courses that had a hands-on curriculum. For some students living and quarantining far away from California, including Mandy Han, a senior majoring in design, the changes that online schooling brought to hands-on courses changed their academic plans.
“Before I got into design, I was an art major, so I painted a lot, and ever since COVID happened, I stopped taking a bunch of studio courses,” Han said. “Because I had to take Zoom [classes], I took a lot of design classes at Roski … and as I shifted to taking design classes, that’s how I found my new interest.”
For Zhang, enrolling in a local in-person engineering program in her home country led her to see the importance of lab research for her career. 
“I eventually decided that I’m probably not going to go into industry in the future and probably going to go get a PhD because I like that [research] experience,” Zhang said.
Moving into Spring 2021, while most classes were still online, the University increased in-person campus access through study canopies, libraries, outdoor recreation areas and swimming pools. People could enter campus by using the Trojan Check app, the campus symptom tracker that produces a daily QR code that staff at campus access points scan upon entry – now another step in students’ regular routines.
Trojan Check has been met with mixed responses from the USC community since its inception last Spring. Erin Coulon, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said that while showing a QR code is more convenient than continually showing a vaccination record to access campus, the website itself could be improved.
“The technology we’re using is a little bit bulky … It’s not as efficient as it could be.” Coulon said. “I like having a QR code we just quickly show [at the gate]. I guess we could just optimize it a little bit more.”
At the end of Spring 2021, the University held an in-person commencement ceremony for both the Classes of 2020 and 2021, followed by the return of in-person classes in Fall 2021, including a weekly coronavirus testing requirement for students through nasal and saliva testing at three different campus locations. 
This requirement became regular practice for campus entrants until USC’s newest coronavirus update, sent in a campuswide email on March 4. Based on Los Angeles County’s revised health orders and decreasing coronavirus cases, the University eliminated its indoor masking mandate and weekly testing requirement for vaccinated students and faculty March 7.
The email described a turning point for the Trojan community over the last two years of coronavirus restrictions and noted the anxieties individuals may have over looser restrictions on masking.
“We deeply appreciate all the acts of community support that you have shown, and the consideration you have given for all who have labored these long two years to keep our campuses safe,” the email read. “You have our deeply felt gratitude for continuing to show kindness toward one another as we begin this transition.”

When I turned on “Turning Red,” I expected to watch just another feel-good Disney movie about a young girl with the power to turn into a red panda. What I didn’t expect was a representation of the very expectations and family pressure that I experienced growing up in an Asian family.
As the first person in my family to grow up in America, I always felt this extra need to succeed and follow whatever path my parents had planned for me. My parents had done everything they could to set me up for success, and so of course I had to do everything I could to stick to that, right? It wasn’t that easy. I didn’t want to be a lawyer or doctor like they wanted. I had no plans to attend a prestigious graduate school. I instead wanted to spend my years pursuing different passions and going out with my friends. 
I’ve found some major differences between Asian and American cultural values. Traditional Asian family values often conflicted with individualistic American values.
Fulfilling both sides of my identity has been a battle. A battle that has been more difficult to face when I felt like others around me weren’t going through the same thing. However, the relationship between Mei Lee and her mother Ming showed me that this was an experience a whole generation of Asian Americans have dealt with. 
Like Mei, I would do anything to see my favorite artist in concert. I begged my parents to go to Halsey’s Badlands Tour in middle school, but I knew it would be a hard no when I told them it was on a school night. At one point, I was on the phone with my dad sobbing during a football game because they wouldn’t let me go. They didn’t understand the appeal or why I would put my school work on hold for it. 
Before I moved away for college, there was an intergenerational disconnect between my parents and me. I thought it was right to put my wants first at times when they thought family or school should be my priority. I didn’t know who was right or wrong in this situation because no one I knew was in the exact same situation.
That is most likely why I didn’t expect to relate to “Turning Red” as much as I do. The movie showed me that representation is about more than just color but also cultural experiences. Growing up, it was hard to find movies that were actually relevant to my own life. Everything seemed to feature another white actor or actress that was nothing like me. It wasn’t until very recently that I saw my Southeast Asian culture on the big screen in the 2021 film, “Raya and the Last Dragon.”
American media has long been without comprehensive, accurate Asian representation. According to a recent study from USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, Asians and Pacific Islanders made up less than 8% of speaking roles in popular Hollywood films from 2007 to 2019. The United States population includes tens of millions of Asians and Asian Americans, yet we fail to be seen in mainstream media. When we are, it’s to fit a certain Western stereotype. 
This issue can be attributed to the lack of Asians within Hollywood’s entire industry and has even been rationalized under the basis of budgeting. Asian Americans make up a very small percentage of all leading roles in Hollywood. One percent, to be exact, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. This leaves the 18 million Americans of Asian descent to only be represented by this one percent. Consequently, the few Asian leading roles cannot represent such a large population, which often leaves Asians not being represented at all in the media.
Movies such as “Turning Red” and “Raya and the Last Dragon” show great strides for Asian representation. I wish I could have seen myself like this on the big screen when I was growing up, and I thank Disney for giving the next generation the representation we desperately need.

This review contains spoilers from episodes 1-4
It’s a tale as old as time: A woman realizes she’s dissatisfied with life, moves to a small town and finds love in an unexpected place. Hulu’s new comedy series “Life & Beth” is exactly this, but it somehow manages to tell the story in a new, engaging way.
Created and produced by comedian Amy Schumer, “Life & Beth” is a witty, fun exploration of a woman’s life unraveling. Beth (Schumer) is a 40-year-old wine saleswoman trying to convince herself she’s happy with her life, but she begins to question her choices and find out whom she really wants to be following an unexpected incident.
What exactly is Schumer’s new  comedy about? 
That’s hard to discern with a plot that jumps between timelines and never really seems to find its footing storywise. The first episode opens with Beth meeting with two clients who are never introduced and don’t appear in the series again. The scene sloppily introduces Schumer’s character by having her break down and give the clients her life story, but it’s a confusing way to start the show. In fact, the series feels as if it’s the start of the second season; it dives right in without allowing the audience to catch up. 
After Beth’s mother (a hilarious Laura Benanti) passes away, Beth questions her life choices, realizing that she isn’t as happy as she pretends to be with her job. Her longtime boyfriend proposes to her the same day as her mother’s funeral, causing her to break up with him and move back to her hometown, realizing she is unsatisfied with her life. 
“Life & Beth” develops more of a plot as the season progresses, though it still feels more like a collection of scenes from someone’s life than a coherent story. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the show is its connection to Schumer’s own life. Many of her experiences inform Beth’s arc, such as when she falls in love with John, a man who works on a vineyard and has similar qualities to Schumer’s husband, who is on the autism spectrum.
The show makes generous use of flashbacks, drawing parallels between Beth’s past and her current endeavors. The flashbacks are, at times, the best parts of the episode, including when Young Beth (Violet Young) deals with the pressure of going through puberty and rejection from a boy in her class. Other times, such as the random clips of Beth as a teenager playing volleyball, they seem out-of-place and distract from the central trajectory. 
Although the plot struggles to find its footing, other elements of “Life & Beth” are fortunately signifcantly more successful. 
The writing itself is sharp and funny, and Schumer herself directs four of the 10 episodes. Jonathan Furmanski’s cinematography adds to the “slice of life” feel of the show by focusing on seemingly minute details, such as Beth making a bed or eating a granola bar. These details also increase the value of the flashbacks by using cinematography as an entry point. For example, Furmanski jumps between Beth and Young Beth holding lipstick in episode two, eventually revealing that the lipstick reminds Beth of the time her mother helped her wear makeup for the first time. 
While the lack of a clear beginning to the story is a bit jarring at first, it also works in the show’s favor. “Life & Beth” is simply a show about everyday life, something any audience member can relate to. The characters drive the story instead of the other way around, and it’s refreshing to see art that doesn’t rely on flashy ideas and melodramatic plots. Even more than that, “Life & Beth’s” premiere perfectly aligned with the middle of Women’s History Month: It proves that the lives and stories of ordinary women are valuable and interesting. 
What “Life & Beth” lacks in plot, it certainly makes up for in comedy. Without losing its authenticity, it is witty and hilarious throughout. But, of course, audiences would expect nothing less from Schumer.

Charli XCX is a sellout. At least, that’s what she wants you to think.
“tip for new artists: just do what they say,” the 29-year-old singer tweeted in September 2021. A short series of, equally glamorous and gory, photos accompanied the cheeky advice, the kind of “Jennifer’s Body” core imagery that would have done numbers on Tumblr a decade ago. And these weren’t the only kind words of wisdom Charli offered prior to the rollout of “Crash;” other helpful tips shared on social media included “it only gets worse,” “sell your soul for money and fame” and “suffer in silence.”
From the beginning, Charli advertised “Crash” as satire, an intentionally mainstream venture meant to poke fun at big record companies and the pop superstars they manufacture. This statement was more than fitting for Charli, who often spoke of her frustrations facing this same major-label manipulation.
After a string of radio hits and commercial successes in the early 2010s, Charli veered away from mainstream pop. She began collaborating with names like A.G. Cook and the late SOPHIE, who both hailed from London-based record label and art collective PC Music, known for its overstimulating and futuristic approach to pop music. By curating and uplifting her own circle of friends and collaborators eager to push pop music to its extremes, she helped birth the genre of hyperpop.
She also killed it.
“rip hyperpop?” she captioned an Instagram post kicking off the “Crash” era. Always ahead of the trends, Charli left pop experimentalism behind just as everyone else was catching on. With “Crash,” she was ready to go mainstream again, but on her terms.
Although it was framed as a parody, “Crash” doesn’t feel critical. Rather, it’s a celebration of big, boisterous, polished pop music. The album may not be as intelligent of a statement that Charli has claimed, but it’s still a great time — a string of dance floor-ready bops curated by an artist aware of their simplicity.
“I’m about to crash into the water, gonna take you with me / I’m high voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary,” Charli sings on the title track, the album’s opener. The song’s instrumental harkens back to pop icons of yesteryear, such as Janet Jackson — who Charli cited as a major influence for the project — but the staccato delivery feels straight off “Pop 2.” “Crash” is fortunately still the same glitchy femmebot we know and love.
Charli’s signature sound peaks through her perfect-pop facade just often enough. Album highlight “Lightning” proves as striking as its title with a hard-hitting chorus and a distorted outro that breaks down with as much gusto as 2019’s immaculate “Gone.”
Likewise, the playful “Yuck” serves as an updated, 2022-friendly version of Kesha’s “Grow a Pear,” putting a unique spin on the typical don’t-catch-feelings warning song with the swaggering confidence she’s known for: “Put me on a pedestal / ‘cause my love’s incredible / Don’t wait up on me / I can’t make those plans / Catch me if you can.”
Elsewhere, Charli’s references are her strong point. Single “Beg For You” faithfully interpolates September’s “Cry for You” with the help of pop-experimentalist Rina Sawayama. It’s a genius meeting of pop history with pop future, helmed by two artists who sound at-home in the middle. “Used To Know Me” samples Robin S.’s “Show Me Love,” putting the perfect stamp on Charli’s love letter to pop music.
Therein lies “Crash’s” greatest weakness: The cynical concept that Charli touted on social media is scarcely present in the actual music.
 There’s no sinister undercurrent or knowing grin behind her verses. Without her constant shepherding and PR campaigns all displaying the same message, “Crash’s” supposed commentary would cease to exist.
Unfortunately, Charli set the bar high for herself. “Pop 2” featured a whopping 13 artists on only 10 tracks, “how i’m feeling now” was made entirely over six weeks during coronavirus lockdowns. While Charli’s past successes don’t completely spoil “Crash’s” fun, they question its importance.
On album closer “Twice,” Charli sings of trusting your gut and living in the moment: “All the things I love are gonna leave me / One day you’re never gonna be there / I tell myself to take it easy / Don’t think twice about it.” Perhaps this was her approach to making “Crash” — after years of churning out avant-garde, mind-bending pop music at high speeds, she’s just having fun. Maybe she should be allowed to.
Charli may not be driving “Vroom Vroom’s” Lavender Lamborghini or her “White Mercedes” anymore, but she’s still behind the wheel in full control. And she’s not afraid to go off-course — buckle up.

While there is no correct set of things you have to do to celebrate Women’s History Month — you can support local organizations, advocate through social media and purposefully research extremely imporant issues affecting women worldwide — a small and just as critical method of celebration is reading. Here are a few titles reminding which will help remind us of the great inspiration and force that women are.
“American Spy” by Lauren Wilkinson 
Nominated for the NAACP Image Award and shortlisted for the Center for Fiction First Novel prize, “American Spy” takes on a new unique angle of the Cold War, starring Marie Mitchell, a Black FBI spy. After dealing with scraps of low-profile work, Marie is suddenly tasked with bringing down Burkina Faso’s president, Thomas Sankara. Marie desperately says yes, despite her misgivings on the ulterior motives of the sudden job offer, the weight of her sister’s death and her conflicting personal opinions on Sankara. However, going through with this job will challenge her beliefs as a lover, sister, spy and American. 
Based on true events, “American Spy” captures the politics of race, womanhood and success with an incredibly brilliant female protagonist. Although about a spy, this novel will force you to apply the lessons Marie learns and the difficult emotions she tackles to your own life quite brilliantly.   
“We Can Be Heroes” by Kyrie McCauley 
Named one of Parade’s YA Books of the Year and a Rise: A Feminist Book Project Book of the Year, “We Can Be Heroes” emphasizes girls standing up for each other when no one else will. When Beck and Vivian’s mutual friend, Cassie, is killed in a school shooting, they finally agree on one thing: revenge. Making sure the town and the world never will forget Cassie, the two paint murals of her, catching a famous podcaster’s attention who is working on Cassie’s case. Beck and Vivian become the center of attention in a town debate while delivering closure to Cassie’s ghost. “We Can Be Heroes” powerfully depicts the pain caused by gun violence and domestic violence while artfully projecting the protagonists’ cry for justice and call for action. It is an extremely painful look into a common issue, one which will ignite your passion to conduct change. 
“Furia” by Yamile Saied Méndez
Called “La Furia” on the soccer field, Camila Hassan, an obedient daughter at home, dreams of a soccer scholarship at a North American university. When her team qualifies for a South American tournament, Camila envisions a sure path to success. However, her strict parents stand in the way of pursuing her fútbol passion. When her childhood crush returns as an international fútbol star, Camila decides that being a girl doesn’t mean she can’t achieve her dreams too. 
“Furia” seeks to inspire girls to live their own passions in the context of sports without giving up on love and identity.  
“The Genius of Women” by Janice Kaplan
From Janice Kaplan, journalist and creator and host of “The Gratitude Diaries,” “The Genius of Women” is a combination of a personal memoir, narrative and inspiration to highlight women geniuses brushed aside by history. Including interviews with women geniuses in a variety of fields from science to art, Kaplan challenges the  wide spread male-oriented definition of genius to celebrate the outstanding work done by women that smashed through obstacles in their own ways. This book is perfect for anyone looking for an engaging set of stories about real heroines from the past and present and wanting to receive incredible motivation to pursue their passions. 
“Recitatif” by Toni Morrison
For a quick but powerful read, try “Recitatif” by Toni Morrison, a Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Prize in Literature and National Book Critics Circle Award recipient. The narrative follows Twyla and Roberta’s friendship as children through adulthood as they part and reunite. Their relationship centers the story, emphasizing the power of perception – of which Morrison challenges by not identifying the racial identity of the women. Commenting on the threads of social reality dictated by the constructed concept of race, Morrison crafts a narrative that focuses on women — and only women — and the American experience as a woman in the 1980s when it was first published, and now in modern day. 
“Out” by Natsuo Kirino
A heart-pounding thriller, “Out,” details four friends that work together, harboring their disturbing troubles. When Yayoi Yamamoto kills her abusive husband, her three friends aid her in covering up the crime. Though they falsely pin the crime on a man who had a grudge against Yayoi’s husband, he seeks to viciously get back at each of the women. Written by one of Japan’s most popular authors, this crime mystery provides a shocking look at the things that build up, pushing people to commit violent acts. Kirino does not pull her punches, including moving commentary meant to discredit female stereotypes (and encourage women to rebel against patriarchal norms), forcing the reader to think about mortality. 
Overall, these stories are simply a minor percentage of the extremely wide-ranging narratives about women. The permanence of literature reminds us that there’s an infinite amount of stories of the past and present that haven’t been brought to light. From failures to triumphs, each story slowly expands the visibility and accessibility of women for women.

Rick Caruso formally announced his candidacy on Twitter for Los Angeles mayor Feb. 11. 
To most Angelenos, Caruso is primarily known as the billionaire businessman who founded his own real estate company and formerly served as the president of the civilian L.A. Police Commission. To the USC community, he is known as the Chair of the Board of Trustees, member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and member of the Trojan Squires. The Caruso family are also long-time USC supporters who have donated to organizations such as the USC Inter-Greek Society Fund, Our Savior Parish Church and USC Caruso Catholic Center. 
It would be an understatement to say that his connections with USC run deep. 
Does he deserve a vote in the mayoral election from the Trojan Family because of his strong USC ties? While one might be tempted to reciprocate his generosity as a donor and choose to elect Caruso as mayor, L.A. voters should fully take into account his political history and campaign proposals before voting. 
Caruso mainly claims that he is running for mayor purely out of a love for L.A. and for the betterment of the community. He additionally stated that he will work only for $1 a year in his “Corruption and Ethics” section on his campaign’s website. However, with his estimated $4 billion net worth, this still feels like lip service. 
One does not earn $4 billion without the exploitation of the working class. Vowing to not make money while working is almost like a backhanded flex to working-class people rather than a praisable feat.
Caruso’s performative politics of solely running for the good of society and humanity is incredibly misleading, despite its commonality among billionaire politicians. Donald Trump, is a notable billionaire businessman-turned-politician, who ran for president to push his own personal politics, like immigration controls and trade protectionism. 
Caruso’s other proposals — “Clean Up LA” and ending street homelessness — also are well-intentioned but still stigmatize people that are unhoused. Reducing homelessness is an issue that needs solutions, but framing this as something that needs “cleaning up” is dehumanizing and implies that people who are experiencing homelessness are merely producers of waste. 
Caruso makes it clear that he will create “inexpensive” communities with tiny homes and implement “cost effective” methods to house people. While his real estate company provides upscale living, he proposes the use of seemingly dignified shipping containers and modular housing. 
Although his campaign website mentions providing mental health care, rent assistance to people experiencing homelessness and has strong points to his campaign, they conflict with his stance on the state of policing and public safety.
Caruso, with the L.A. police union support, also addresses public safety and the police in his mayoral campaign, looking to invest more money into the police to “making them better” and add 1,500 more officers to the force. 
As perpetrators of violence, police, according to the L.A. Times, kill a rough average of 42 people per year. So, does “making them better” imply better trained violence perpetrators? 
Caruso plans to address violence in “high-crime” areas, which typically contain people experiencing homelessness and those with mental health issues. If Caruso’s mission really is to assist people with their mental health necessities and those who are unhoused, producers and victims of crime, what will additional policing really do? If the sources of “crime” and “violence” are hypothetically resolved as a result of his provisions, then the police will not have violence to address. 
His campaign also notes that he will “crack down on property crime” as he believes that they are not adequately enforced by the LAPD. However, what will be the consequences for forced removal of property of unhoused communities, such as the Echo Park encampments last year? Under this notion, should City Councilman Mitch O’Farrell be punished for failing to properly house the people he evicted in Echo Park? 
Being “cost effective” with homelessness and demanding President Joe Biden and Governor Gavin Newsom for more police funding expose what Caruso really wants to do with Los Angeles. While Rick Caruso’s charitable donations to USC are greatly appreciated, his financial actions outside of philanthropy reveal his character. 
As for billionaires running for office, they should be transparent because their true intentions will eventually shine through. Rather than boast a nonexistent salary, billionaires should blatantly state that they don’t need the money, so they won’t earn a salary. 
So, whether Caruso receives your vote or not, be wary of performative politics, especially when they’re coming from billionaires.

It’s game day at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
You walk near the South Lawn of the Coliseum near Exposition Park Drive, excited for the game. There’s the familiar “Hot dog, hot dog” exclamations as a vendor bangs their spatula on the grill. The idea crosses your mind to buy one, but something in the distance catches the corner of your eye. 
It’s a larger, grander grill with a master flipping burgers and engaging in small talk with fans. The tailgate, known as “Psychogate,” is hosted by Roy Nwaisser, a fan who has become as associated with USC football as its Cardinal and Gold uniforms. It’s a tailgate that’s grown so much in popularity through the years that there’s an official website for it. 
Nwaisser has attended every USC football game over the last 30 years. During the coronavirus-shortened season, Nwaisser only went to games that allowed fans, setting an asterisk on the record.  
His commitment to the streak is one thing, but his hospitality to the people around him is another.
What started as a normal tailgate exploded into “Psychogate,” a pregame party where everyone is welcomed. Almost all fans will shy away from allowing opposing fans to join them at the party, but that’s simply not the case for Nwaisser. 
“He’s just a big-time ambassador for USC and especially for USC football,” said Paul Baltierra, who met Nwaisser through Twitter. “Seeing that guy … out on the road games and just want to get people together and then at Psychogate at home where he’s telling any opposing fan like, ‘Hey, come have fun.’” 
Origins and close calls
His love for the Trojans began in a nontraditional fashion. As a kid, Nwaisser butt heads with a family friend at Thanksgiving. That week, USC and UCLA were playing, and his family asked them both who they would root for.
Nwaisser’s friend said the Bruins, prompting Nwiasser to automatically side with the Trojans.  
“That was the first time I ever took a side on USC vs. UCLA,” Roy said. “The first time I decided to side with USC.”
Nwaisser wouldn’t attend his first football game until 1990, his freshman year at USC. While he didn’t attend most of the season’s games, it was the rivalry game that caught his interest. 
Although, “to this day,” Nwaisser believes the rivalry game is “one of the most exciting football games,” he’s seen, the game didn’t immediately lead to his attendance streak. 
“The way it started was my senior year, I just thought it would be really cool to go to every USC football game, home and away,” he said. “And so I did.”
He found it fun and did the same the next year, then again the year after. Then again and again for 29 years. The streak will be 30 years this fall.
“The streak is completely accidental,” Nwaisser said. “[I] never planned on having any streak like this.”
That accident sparked a streak older than practically every current undergraduate student. It’s also second to Giles Pellerin’s streak of 797 consecutive games. Nwaisser is at 362. 
Even though it began as an accident, a single moment motivated him to keep it going.
Drowning in law school work the day before USC faced UC Berkeley in the ’90s, Nwaisser thought to himself, “This is where it ends.” The streak was just a little more than two years at the time.
But, something kept nagging and aggravating Nwaisser. The thought of missing the game, one within driving distance, irked him. So, he made a decision.
“I called a buddy of mine in law school [Bob Moreno] who I thought would be crazy enough to go at the last minute, and he was,” Nwaisser said. “We got my car and drove to Cal, didn’t have tickets [and] parked at a meter somewhere, found tickets from a scalper, went to the game and then drove right back home, so we can get back to our classwork.”
That was the point where Nwaisser said that he knew he wanted to keep his streak going as long as possible.   
But there have been multiple close calls to the streak ending. 
USC was set to play Penn State on the road in 1994. Nwaisser and his friend were prepared to travel the Friday night before the game, but his friend’s mom had changed their flights for a better rate. It turned out that the flight they originally booked crashed, killing all 132 people on board. 
Another time, Nwaisser’s game day flight took off moments before LAX was shut down because of an active shooter. 
For the most part, the streak continues, and with how easy it is to buy tickets nowadays, who knows when it will end? In the mid-1990s, flying to games, buying tickets and booking hotels proved more difficult than it is now. As a regular at the AAA office, Nwaisser would always look for each city’s guidebooks which included a list of hotels in that specific city. 
“I would have to go through and call [the hotels] individually to find out how close they were to the airport or to the stadium, and how much their rates were,” he said. “I ended up in some pretty bad dumps.”
It made the process arduous and the “bad dumps” forgettable, but his passion for watching the Trojans steeped it all. 
Some may wonder how it’s possible to keep the streak going. Nwaisser’s simplified outlook on attending games has made it easy — the season usually consists of 12 Saturday games, half of which are at home and, if they’re not home, the distance is manageable. It follows that classic cliche phrase: If there’s a will, there’s a way.
“If anybody really wanted to go to every game for a season, they could probably do it, and it wouldn’t be that hard,” he said. “The hard part is doing it for 30 years [and] not having anything get in the way of a single game. That’s where it takes a little bit of luck.”
Luck is involved but also good friends that help.
Nwaisser’s childhood friend, Michael Reed, was in the middle of planning his wedding. Having known each other since the second grade, Reed wanted Nwaisser to be his best man. 
However, with the wedding taking place during the USC season, planning the day had to be meticulous. 
Reed and his wife originally planned for a Saturday wedding, but the Trojans were playing that day, and Reed knew Nwaisser wouldn’t make the trip. Thankfully, his wife understood. 
“I said, ‘Well, unfortunately, I’m going to have to change it if we can’t change the date.’ She totally understands because she knows how [Nwaisser] is,” Reed said. “So we got married on that Friday, Nov. 24 and went to the reception and everything. And [Roy] took the very first flight out that Saturday.”
“Wants everybody to be together”
Nwaisser’s commitment to the streak is one thing, but his hospitality to the people around him is another.
There’s a side of Nwaisser that people may not notice upon meeting him in person or seeing him on social media. 
Beyond the streak, Baltierra describes Nwaisser as an “extrovert,” someone who’s always trying to get as many people as possible together to have a good time. He’s also always welcoming to road fans, which is easier said than done since the trash talk from opposing supporters can be overwhelming. 
“He’s really big on he wants everybody to enjoy themselves and wants everybody to be together,” Baltierra said. “He’s always said like, ‘Hey, well, I like it when I’m welcome because I go to all these road games.’” 
After all, it was a specific road game where Nwaisser’s moniker as “USC Psycho” catapulted.
Nwaisser’s famous license plate that reads “USC SYCO” was born during his senior year at USC. People thought he got the license plate because he was a psychology major — instead, it was because he wanted to highlight his fandom for the team.
When in law school, Moreno assumed he’d bring the license plate into the game since other fans did to show support for their respective team. 
“The thought never occurred to me to take my license plate to a game, and I was like, ‘Oh, that sounds like a good idea,’” Nwaisser said.  
Next up for the Trojans that season was a trip to South Bend, Ind. and the debut of a license plate that made Nwaisser recognizable. He sat in the front row of the student section during the game then was shown on TV flexing it. 
The next week during USC’s homecoming game, fans began to realize he was the man with the plate. Game attendees came up to him and said they’d seen him on TV, so he proceeded to keep bringing the item with him to games. 
“I get on TV a few times a season. People would see me and just kind of knew me for my license plate,” he said. “Then [I] got on online, I would use ‘USC Psycho’ as my username. And that’s kind of how it started.”
He became known as “USC Psycho,” something that’s stuck with him through his nearly 30-year streak. 
For Nwaisser, he’s not keeping this streak alive to top Pellerin’s famous record. Nwaisser, at the end of the day, is just like any other fan. 
“I’m not doing this so I can break any kind of records. I just do this because I love it,” he said. “If there ever comes a point where I don’t love it, I’ll probably stop.”

About one hundred years ago, three elite universities — Harvard, Yale and Princeton — first put into place the practice of legacy admissions. Their actions were followed closely by several other prestigious institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University. Giving preference to the children of alumni was meant to favor the established, wealthy white population that was most likely to contribute to the universities’ endowments. According to NYU sociology postdoctoral associate Nadirah Farah Foley, these new legacy admissions policies were prompted by the influx of immigrants, many of them Jewish, whom universities viewed as a threat to the student population. 
The pretext given by universities for this exclusionary behavior was that favoring children of alumni preserved the character of a school, preventing those who did not understand its traditions from trampling on them through what universities perceived as their ignorance of American manners, professionalism and etiquette. 
A parallel debate emerged in the last few years, revealing that universities consistently mark down Asian applicants because of their “personal qualities such as ‘likeability,’ ‘courage,’ and being ‘widely respected,’” according to the New York Times. This debate quickly became a lawsuit that will be brought to the Supreme Court in 2018. 
Whatever the rationale behind the practice of legacy admissions today, its impact remained the same throughout its history — a combination of maintaining the elite culture of the school and its endowment, a large trust fund fueled by charitable alumni donations. A New York Times study done in 2017 revealed that across 38 elite universities, there were more students from the top 1% than the bottom 60% of the income distribution curve, in large part due to the staying power of legacy admissions. Wealthier students continue to swell colleges’ bottom line through alumni donations.
Practices that either directly or indirectly harm the chances of non-privileged students and the fairness of the admissions process should no longer be socially acceptable. 
Amid the Black Lives Matter movement, more schools began to pay attention to the injustice of their admissions system. In 2014, Johns Hopkins University announced that it was dropping legacy status from admissions considerations. In the following six years, marginalized populations increased from 15% to 25% while new students with legacy ties dropped from 12.5% to 3.5%, dispelling the notion that legacy students were somehow better applicants regardless of their legacy status and showing indisputably that legacy admissions practices actively take away spots from minority applicants. Amherst College, a school with one of the most loyal alumni networks in the country and a legacy population of 11%, followed suit just this past fall.
Even setting the racial implications of legacy admissions aside, it is clear that the practice is discriminatory when it comes to another important indicator of diversity: socioeconomic status. A study on anonymous tax records show that the median family income of a USC student is $161,400, with 63% of students coming from the top 20% of the income distribution. For context, this is $56,500 and 15% more than UCLA. 
When more than three of five students come from the richest quintile of society, it shows that the admissions process is significantly centered around the money students were born into — if you didn’t win the socioeconomic lottery, your chances of getting into USC drop significantly.
USC’s class of 2025 is made up of 13% legacy students, exceeding even Johns Hopkins’ 12.5% and Amherst’s 11%, two universities that stand out in their commitment to their alumni and legacy network.
USC’s attitude towards legacy admissions is inconsistent with its larger commitment to a more representative student body. As expressed through recent admissions efforts, 23% of the class of 2025 are students who are the first in their family to attend college and 24% of the class are eligible for Federal Pell Grants, a very competitive federal package awarded to low-income families, taking the record from the class of 2024 as being the most diverse class in USC history. But USC must do more to combat unjust admissions.
So, which USC do we want? The one that favors the children of the rich and the well-connected or the one that opens its gates to a wider group of students? USC is likely clinging to the outdated practice of legacy preferences out of a desire to maintain the strength of the Trojan Family, the school’s vast network of alumni concentrated in Southern California that is one of the University’s biggest selling points. In 2015, Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said “We see the status as being important” with the children of USC alumni having a higher acceptance rate.
However, students who would receive the benefits of legacy admissions would in fact have certain advantages, regardless of whether or not legacy status was considered in isolation. Studies published in Forbes, CNBC, and The Washington Post, have shown a direct link between income and SAT score, suggesting that students in established families whose parents attended elite universities and earn a combined $100,000 annually are twice as likely as low-income and first-generation applicants to score above a 1400 on the SAT, a score necessary to be competitive in USC’s application process.
Despite it’s self-proclaimed commitment to diversity and inclusion, and despite the overwhelming data that legacy practices actively take away spots from ethnically and socioeconomically marginalized groups – USC continues to stand by this outdated and fundamentally discriminatory practice. 
It is time to abandon this tolerance of institutional inequality. Seduced by the donations that legacy admissions bring in, the admissions department has chosen to look the other way. But, as part of the Trojan Family and part of the greater Los Angeles community, we cannot turn a blind eye to the injustice of legacy admissions.

Racing Louisville FC finished nearly twice as far from playoff qualification as it did the bottom of the National Women’s Soccer League a season ago. While it was only the club’s inaugural season, leadership wasted no time moving the entire organization into a different direction. 
Back in August, Racing traded USWNT superstar Christen Press to new 2022 expansion franchise Angel City FC in exchange for the rights to the second overall pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft. 
One month later, the club fired Head Coach Christy Holly amid the wave of firings that ripped through the NWSL last fall, though Racing declined to offer any official explanation. 
Taking over as head coach in December 2021, Kim Björkegren was tasked with rebuilding this roster — particularly the lackluster midfield. Louisville got right to work in the draft, selecting Florida State’s Jaelin Howell and USC alumna Savannah DeMelo with its own first-round choice. 
DeMelo is one of the greatest players to ever wear the cardinal and gold, a pillar of the Trojan midfield throughout her time at USC. But don’t take it from me, take it from the All-Pac-12 honors — four in four seasons to be exact.
This season, especially in the three games the Trojans were without Pac-12 Forward of the Year Penelope Hocking, DeMelo showed exactly what she can bring to a team at the next level. 
The former USC captain got the nod in midfield — as she had her entire career — in all three of those contests, performing a different task in each of them. DeMelo cameoed as everything from a free-moving attacking mid to a holding midfield partnership. 
DeMelo’s ability to defend and drop deep in possession guided USC through the first 90 minutes against Stanford while her effectiveness further up in the press created Croix Bethune’s overtime match-winner. 
“We will attack with more players,” said Björkegren in an interview with the Louisville Courier-Journal. “We will try to press high a little bit more instead of just sit back and wait.”
The message in Louisville is clear this season. Score more goals by effectively converting defensive pressure into attacking opportunities — exactly what DeMelo built her USC career on. 
Leading the line for an active USC press, the former Trojan captain is eighth on the school’s all-time points list and her 28 career assists are good for third in program history. 
To put the ball in the back of the net you, of course, need prolific goal-scorers, but Racing already has that in forward Nadia Nadim. Louisville desperately needs a midfield machine that, for lack of better phrasing, can get her the ball. Nadim only managed three goals last season — a disappointing output for someone who averaged more than a goal per 90 with PSG. 
USC’s attack suffered no such issues with DeMelo pulling the strings. The first round pick provided the service for the last 3 Pac-12 Forwards of the Year in Tara McKeown and the aforementioned Hocking. 
This Louisville roster is built to compete as they were a season ago, but they were let down by coaching and the absence of a productive midfield. The club addressed the first with the hiring of Björkegren, and DeMelo’s proven production and versatility will ensure they address the second. 
McKeown stepped right in last season and started for the Washington Spirit en route to the club’s first championship. Louisville has its sights set on the same, and by turning to another USC product in DeMelo, it got that much closer to replicating it.

From a young age, many of our parents fleetingly mention the trifecta of “ideal” career paths: business, medicine or law. Oftentimes, the discussion heavily focuses on the idea that those are the only careers that will provide you with a financially stable and fulfilling future, and there are simply “no other options.” However, that sentiment, particularly with business might no longer hold any weight. 
There is no doubt that a business degree can provide numerous organizational, leadership and critical thinking skills. There is immense value in understanding the broader economy, the corporate world and crucial mathematical skills. Moreover, at a place like USC, there are tremendous networking opportunities. The opportunities and skills seem endless, but let’s outline what happens after graduation. 
Many people believe that a business major will provide a multitude of job opportunities postgraduation, but this is not always the case. General business majors experience a lack of differentiation amongst their competitors, thus experiencing high levels of unemployment. There is a clear divide amongst the unemployment of general business majors and business majors with a math focus, such as finance and accounting. 
Bankrate recently conducted a study highlighting the most valuable college majors in 2021 based on average income and unemployment rate; a general business major ranked at #58, while various engineering and STEM majors ranked at the top of the list. 
According to The Washington Post writer Jeffrey J. Selingo, this is believed to be partially due to the lack of critical writing emphasis in the business undergraduate curriculum. Selingo states, “The results of national standardized tests, such as the Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus … found that students who major in business made significantly fewer gains in college in critical thinking, writing and communication, and analytical reasoning than [other majors].”
Many of these issues are derived from the fact that a business administration major is incredibly general. There is no way to cover all of its components in-depth, and fundamental learning objectives can easily get lost. It seems that many colleges keep business studies very broad and leave much of the outside investigation to the student, which is not always a good thing. 
The influx of business majors is a product of what happens when you expect an 18-year-old to decide what they want to do for the rest of their lives. Many teenagers do not have a burning passion when they first enter college, and there is not much time to navigate their passion without spending more time and money. Students expect a return on their educational investment, financially or skill-wise, which is in part why we see such a large number of business majors as it presents itself as being able to open many doors.
Every college student questions whether or not they picked the best major, which is why it is so important to remain cognizant of the constantly changing job market, benefits and disadvantages of each college major. It is also crucial to recognize that the value of studying a specific major depends on the person and college. 
The fluctuating supply and demand of business majors within the job market is rather serious and something that all current undergraduate general business majors must consider.

With the addition of new Head Coach Lincoln Riley, USC has revamped for this upcoming season in terms of both new recruits and significant transfers. These star players include Oklahoma transfer quarterback Caleb Williams and Oregon transfer running back Travis Dye, along with promising recruits such as four-star recruit Raleek Brown. 
With new members on the Trojans squad, USC had the tenth best overall 2022 class in the nation. With a new regime and era underway, here are five things to look out for as the Trojans prep for their 2022 season.
1. Running back developments
The running back room for this USC team is stacked with both experienced and young talent. First, there is the already mentioned new running back recruit Brown out of Santa Ana who is known for his speed and skills all-around the field. A strong mentor for Brown on this team will be Dye. 
Dye racked in 1,271 yards and 16 touchdowns last season and also had 402 yards and two touchdowns from his 46 catches. His versatility will be important to keep an eye on during practice. 
There is also Stanford transfer Austin Jones who was effective last season in spite of the team’s poor offensive line where he attained 378 yards with two touchdowns and caught 32 passes for 267 yards. Dye and Jones offer a one-two punch the Trojans can utilize. 
One remaining Trojan from last season, redshirt junior Darwin Barlow, only rushed for 289 yards and had two touchdowns. Although low in the depth chart, Barlow may prove helpful to the new running backs as they get used to the team. New running back coach Kiel McDonald recruited Barlow when he was at Utah and said he’s looking forward to working with Barlow. 
Overall, there is a diverse set of running backs this season whose development this spring is key.
2. Caleb Williams and his new team
It is safe to say that incoming quarterback Caleb Williams may prove as one of the most integral components of this team. Already on the Heisman Trophy watchlist, Williams is looking to build on his breakout freshman season. 
Ensuring that he is well-adjusted with his new teammates is critical to look for during the spring camp. Thankfully, he has some familiar faces from Oklahoma such as Riley and wide receiver and former Sooner teammate Mario Williams. 
3. Forming the new class of wide receivers 
With Drake London gone for the NFL draft, there are new openings in USC’s wide receiver room. With an interesting combination of incoming players — such as Brenden Rice from Colorado, Terrell Bynum from Washington and four-star Mater Dei recruit C.J. Williams — and returners — Gary Bryant Jr. and Michael Jackson III — the Trojan’s offense will need all the training they can get this spring, particularly as they work for the first time under Riley. 
4. Korey Foreman’s growth
The former 2021 no. 2 recruit in the nation, defensive lineman Korey Foreman has a lot of potential to revitalize the Trojans’ defense. Despite a relatively quiet freshman season playing in 11 games, Foreman had 11 tackles, with 3.5 of them losses for a total of 8 yards. He was also able to get 2.5 sacks in total for the season.
In his first comments as a Trojan, new defensive line coach Shaun Nua said he sees a bright future in Foreman. He also mentioned that Foreman is “going to be pushed if he wants to be pushed.”
Making sure that Foreman properly develops and trains during spring camp will be vital for the Trojans’ success on defense moving forward. 
5. Alex Grinch’s new defense 
In general, a lot of talk has circulated about the Trojans’ upcoming effectiveness on the offensive side. However, improving the defense will be an important part of spring training with new defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, who Riley brought over from Oklahoma. 
We already discussed the role Foreman will play in this lineup. However, new recruits, such as five-star freshman cornerback Domani Jackson and four-star safety Zion Branch, are also important to look out for during the spring camp, as they will be key parts of the secondary since many players left this season like cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart and safety Isaiah Pola-Mao. 
A USC side that allowed its opposition to score 40-plus points in five of its 12 games last season is due for some work. So, this spring training is crucial for Grinch and his staff to fix any problems and improve their play.
