In Michel Faber’s The Book of Strange New Things, pastor Peter Leigh and his wife Bea are separated by light-years. The ambiguously acronymed USIC spends millions of dollars to send him to the planet Oasis, where a settlement of aliens awaits his Christian teachings. He gets on a spaceship, remains unconscious for nearly a month and arrives in a strange but beautiful new world. But once he gets there, he receives letters from Bea detailing the deterioration of the Earth — criminal activity and natural disasters spiking all over the globe — to the point where she, the one who converted her husband from the everything-addict to the prudent pastor, loses her faith entirely.
The novel is narrated in the  third person but follows Peter exclusively as he travels to the aliens’ (called Oasans) settlement, preaches and lives among them, then returns home to find horrendous letters from his wife and little explanation from the not-very-forthcoming USIC staff. His life is completely transformed on Oasis — even the rain is different there, swirling and spiraling in the air — but he comes to realize he and Bea are undergoing entirely different transformations, both outside themselves and within. Peter is coming to understand Christianity in a new light, more faithful than ever, revitalized; Bea is depressed, lonely, losing faith. And while Peter’s world is evolving and growing, Bea’s is falling apart.
In terms of style, Faber’s writing itself draws suspiciously little attention. It is understated, simple, almost spiritually so, in a way that absorbs the reader invisibly — while the writing is beautiful, it is the content that is highlighted. But at the same time, this calm invisibility reflects the content in an insidious way. Peter and Bea are transparent: their intentions are clear and their communication is straightforward; the USIC, on the other hand, hides much of the knowledge it has without drawing attention, much like Faber’s style itself. Even the staff, who are well-informed of the company’s plans and reasoning, seem blissfully ignorant of the agenda and especially the “why” question. Peter asks several employees, “Why is the USIC even up here exploring this planet to begin with?” The answers are generally, and very purposefully vague.
Faber is also a master of blending genres. Obviously, the novel is fiction — but the author meshes science fiction with suspense-thriller with drama and even romance. Even the bare-bones plot is a collision of science/technology and religion.
On that note, the spirituality plays a key role in the novel, yet it never becomes too heavy-handed. For a religious person, it reads as a new religious experience; for a non-religious person, it reads as a fascinating cultural case study of the Oasans themselves. Through either lens, the Oasans are intriguing, mysterious and complex in a way that makes the reader hungry to know more about them, even after the story is finished.
This read is frustrating in several ways, however. First, Faber is a master of suspense (if you need proof beyond The Book of Strange New Things, read his also masterful Under the Skin). But the book is long — about 500 pages. Consequently, it’s a page-turner, but a frustrating one: the information you ache to know and the questions formulating as you read often go unanswered for chapters at a time, if they ever get answered at all. Second, Peter as a character isn’t exactly the most in-touch with the female mind, and his situation doesn’t help. Idealistic man with little knowledge of woman’s emotions goes as far as humanly possible from the one woman he cares about? It’s enough to make a reader worry about that woman’s mental health. A reader might find herself practically shouting at the book (sorry, suitemates) in the hope that Peter would figure his life out. These two frustrations, of course, are how you know you’re reading a good book; and they’re precisely why this book is sure to be a favorite.
The Book of Strange New Things is a complex and beautiful exploration of technology, science, spirituality and the human soul. It contains no definitive answers, but it has so many facets that it can appeal to every person who commits to reading it. The examination of spirituality and complex emotional relationships (between Peter and Bea, but also between Peter and the Oasans) did the trick. For someone else, the draw of this novel could be the intrigue of translating Christianity to a people who, arguably, Jesus did not save; the intricate yet ambiguous detail of Oasan life; or the ever-present mystery of the USIC. This book has a thousand angles, each as interesting as the last but in very different ways. Ultimately, Faber’s new and possibly last novel is hefty in both size and content but worth every page.

It’s common for students to experience mixed emotions at the beginning of the spring term. While many are eager to return to campus and reunite with friends, second semester lacks the novelty characteristic of fall. Despite well-intentioned New Years’ resolutions, students may succumb to unhealthy eating habits within the first few days of classes.
In order to start the semester off right, students must tackle problems such as unnecessary snacking, sleep deprivation and procrastination. While these things are occasionally unavoidable, a healthier, more balanced lifestyle is attainable through simple changes to one’s daily routine. The following easy recipes and cooking tips will help even the most kitchen-averse individuals eat more healthily throughout the academic year.
Roasted Carrots, Three Ways 
Roasting transforms even the most unpalatable raw vegetables, such as Brussels sprouts and carrots, into a crave-worthy snack or even main meal. The simple process of coating vegetables in some olive oil, seasoning with salt and pepper and throwing them into the oven, accommodates college students’ busy schedules. The following recipe outlines the basic technique for roasting and provides three serving suggestions: salad, side dish or savory snack. If you are short on time, keeping pre-roasted vegetables in the fridge makes for effortless weeknight dinners.
• 5 medium multi-colored carrots, cut lengthwise then crosswise
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• ½ teaspoon thyme leaves (optional)
• Salt and pepper, to taste
Serves 1. Active: 5 minutes; Total: 30 minutes
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the sliced carrots on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with olive oil until completely coated. Sprinkle with thyme leaves and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast until the carrots are tender and golden, for about 20 to 25 minutes. Serve immediately.
Variations:
• Carrot and Avocado Salad: Toss carrots with 1 cup of arugula, ½ of a sliced avocado and 2 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese. Drizzle with red wine vinegar and olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Serve.
• Spiced Roasted Carrots with Greek Yogurt: Toss carrots with ¼ teaspoon ground cumin seed before roasting. Spread ½ cup Greek yogurt on a plate. Top with ¼ cup flat leaf parsley leaves and roasted carrots. Season with additional salt. Serve.
White Bean and Walnut Salad with Fried Eggs
Canned beans are a pantry staple that every college student should have on hand. While beans may not sound exciting upon first thought, their neutral flavor serves as an ideal base for countless recipes, such as this luxurious white bean and walnut salad.
This simple dish possesses the best virtues of a meatless meal. High in protein and good fats, the entire recipe comes together in just a few minutes. Cooking the white beans in a splash of olive oil gives them a crunchy, golden exterior that perfectly complements toasted walnuts and fresh, vibrant arugula. For an even heartier version, feel free to add shredded chicken or even thinly sliced ham.
• One 15-ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed, drained, and pat dry
• 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
• ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
• 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
• 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
• 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
• 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
• ½ cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
• 1½ cups baby arugula
• ½ cup coarsely chopped toasted walnuts
• 2 large eggs
• Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Serves 2. Total: 20 min.
1. Warm 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet set over medium-high heat. Stir in red pepper flakes and thyme and allow them to perfume the oil for about 1 minute. Add beans, season them with salt and black pepper and stir. Continue to stir until the beans are golden brown and crisp, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes. Then, remove from the burner and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of oil, mustard, vinegar, and lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Add cooked beans, parsley, arugula, and toasted walnuts; toss gently until all the ingredients are coated in the dressing.
3. Using the same skillet you used to cook the beans, warm the remaining tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Wait a few minutes until the oil is very hot and smoky. Crack the two eggs into the skillet and cook, undisturbed, until the whites are golden brown and crisp at the edges while the yolk is still runny.
4. Divide the salad evenly between two shallow serving bowls and top each with a fried egg. Serve immediately.

The Westies have been working hard the last few years after it first got together in Nashville and made music touching on themes of fear, love and Americana. It has been roughly two years since the group was formed and recorded these songs, and the collection of music recorded that one December night has eventually led to West Side Stories, The Westies’ debut album, which drops on Jan. 20.
The Westies’ Facebook page tells the story about how lead singer Michael McDermott met Heather Horton after just having avoided time in prison, among other struggles. One listen to the album and the interplaying themes of internal and external conflict become clear. Moreover, it becomes even clearer that McDermott has a knack for self-reflection in his songs, including but not limited to, nightmares about trains, falling in love with a woman who keeps her distance from him and dealing with devils.  West Side Stories seems to be just that: narratives. While the amount of truth to the tales is unknown, The Westies nonetheless shine in its ability to transport others into a sick, ghastly world abundant of loss and betrayal.
“Hell’s Kitchen” appropriately opens the album. The mid-tempo folk rock track follows McDermott as he reflects on life in Hell’s Kitchen, a New York City neighborhood that fostered many of his memories, but now seems unrecognizable to him. “Hell’s Kitchen” exhibits the most prominent elements of the album, including McDermott’s ability to illustrate a world within his music. The guitar’s persistent sound layered over a harmony of strings serves as the foundation on which McDermott’s sultry vocals construct an entire neighborhood. Sonically, the song is reminiscent of Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen, but the clarity of McDermott’s authentic relationship with Hell’s Kitchen allows him to really take complete ownership of the music.
One of the album’s most memorable tracks is “Death,” another mid-tempo about heartbreak. McDermott’s enticing, raw vocals along with the tranquil percussion and bass line make for an eerie, intriguing experience. “Death,” along with “Devil,” are the highlights of the album. Such songs not only exhibit the most interesting production on West Side Stories, but also allow McDermott to showcase his ability to go from an eerily hush voice to a passionate, agonizing shrill.
Among the most significant elements on West Side Stories is the chemistry McDermott and Horton share. Some tracks feature Horton as McDermott’s backup singer, while others feature her singing interplayed with that of McDermott. The warmth of her voice compliments his edge.
Unfortunately, the album declines shortly after “Bars.” The album drifts from a sonically gripping sound toward a dull, uninteresting one. Not only do the themes of tainted relationships and lost battles become redundant, but the choruses also lack the captivating melodies that came so effortlessly in the first half of the album, resulting in a massive letdown. The issue is not that the songs are necessarily bad; it is just that the content is nowhere near as intriguing as that of the first half. Perhaps something as simple as a rearrangement of the track list would have strengthened the album’s ability to maintain the interest of listeners. West Side Stories might be consistent with its lyrical themes, but after a certain point, these themes do not contribute anything new to the album as a whole.
Though McDermott and Horton’s vocal and lyrical ability do not go unnoticed, West Side Stories has its share of moments that might leave some listeners wondering what on earth McDermott just mumbled. Confusing idioms paired with unclear diction restrict the music from attaining its full potential.
Do not mistake the woe on some tracks for romanticized sadness. If the album offers a single message to its listeners, “Bars” says it most directly: “Sometimes you need the darkness in order to ever see the light.”
Despite some issues, by the end of West Side Stories no one will question The Westies’ ability to transport audiences to Hell’s Kitchen, allowing them to visualize the world through The Westies’ smoke-dusted eyes. Though this ability is crucial in entertainment, the lyrical ambiguity along with some of the track’s reccurring themes are ultimately what becomes tiresome in what was at first the music’s initial appeal. McDermott’s vocals thrive because of his passion, making it clear that each of the stories shared on West Side Story are rooted in pure human experience.

On Jan. 14, members of USC Hospitality and Auxiliary Services rallied outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, demanding higher wages. While the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation stood in solidarity with the 20 food service employees, many students merely looked on, failing to acknowledge support for these workers. However, USC students should stand behind the people that serve to make students’ lives more comfortable. Bolstering the workers gives them their deserved reward for providing the USC community with sustenance.
The average salary of the workers, according to the Daily Trojan, is $18,800 per year. These meager wages have to feed children, pay bills and keep roofs over heads, among other necessities. Yet, these workers have been neglected for some time now. The Daily Trojan has reported that conversations about higher wages began last summer, and the issue has yet to be resolved. Last year, the workers, in alignment with Unite Here Local 11 union, held protests for the same cause.
“Our workers are part of the Trojan family, too,” said Chanelle Yang, a member of SCALE. “USC is one of the largest private employers in Los Angeles, and these employees make a salary below the poverty line.”
Falling below the poverty line contributes to a plethora of problems. According to the Daily Trojan, with property prices rising around the USC area, low wages could mean a greater difficulty to maintain homes. Also, because of violence around their neighborhoods, low wages could prohibit workers from moving their families to safer communities. Moreover, workers sometimes have to make difficult decisions to meet basic needs. A worker at Cafe 84 told the Daily Trojan, “It’s either buy my daughter some shoes or pay my bills.” The solution to eliminating these problems is to raise wages to a reasonable level.
To strengthen Local 11’s negotiations with the university, USC students need to express to the administration how much the Hospitality and Auxiliary workers mean to the student population. These people serve the student population every day, yet struggle to meet the national standard of living and are not equipped with fundamental economic security. To join workers in their fight for reasonable wage conditions, USC students must first educate themselves about what constitutes the workers’ wages and then evaluate methods to circulate more funds to the workers. Whatever the method, it is essential to present the workers and USC students as a unit.
This calls for a higher concentration of USC students to use social media and add their voices to the chorus. Instead of being bystanders, USC students can participate in a highly visible social campaign to alleviate the economic burden for USC workers. The lack of wages they receive in comparison to the national standard should fuel a conversation to take place with the university. The Daily Trojan has reported that if USC does not match the demands of the workers, another protest is set to take place on Jan. 29. This could be the perfect setting for students step up and demand improvement in the treatment of USC workers. Hopefully then, these actions would translate to a greater platform and lead more universities to discuss fair compensation.
These USC workers are the backbone of the Trojan experience. They serve students from the beginning of their USC career, contributing as much to the college atmosphere as professors, other students and school activities. It is time for students to help workers who are confined to low wages. It’s time to shoulder some responsibility instead of turning a blind eye.
If you don’t like the wages offered for the work to be completed, go find another job that pays the wage you want, or are able to earn.  Otherwise, go to trade tech school and learn a trade where the upward mobility to earn more money is in the future for you. 
Minimum wage has never been designed to support a family. Most minimum wage earners at 16-24 years old and single. If you ware an adult and trying to raise a family on the minimum wage, you are either lazy or stupid. You cann believe what the unions are telling you, because, all they want is an installed base of union members to support the high wages of the union management and executives; otherwise, why are you paying unions membership dues on a paycheck basis when you are earning the minimum wage? 
Geez sports fans…. get a grip on life. Sometimes it isn’t fair, and folks don’t always get what they want.

After Jezebel posted a leaked email on Friday from the USC chapter of Alpha Chi Omega detailing strict dress code standards for the sorority girls pre-rush, the story spread to BuzzFeed, KABC-TV, Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Tonight, Daily Mail, MTV News and other news outlets, garnering millions of views in the span of a few days. According to Buzzfeed, the sorority rules dictate hair color, eyebrow shape and required Spanx-wearing, which spurred titles of articles ranging from “Crazy Leaked Sorority Email” and “Pure Madness” from E!Online and the Huffington Post. These articles paint a clear narrative: the incident has been written off as evidence of petty sorority life rooted in standards that only meet the eye.
The email, sent in 2013 from the Personal Development and PACE (Promote Alpha Chi Every day) Chair to the rest of the sorority, certainly presents troubling implications regarding diversity in the Greek system at USC. But it is all too easy to explain the attitude of the email by immediately defaulting to the cookie-cutter sorority girl stereotype and denouncing the beauty standards stated in the email as a  product of being obsessed with vanity. The argument ignores the implicit unanswered question: why exactly does Alpha Chi recruitment feel that these standards are necessary? Perhaps the hierarchies of Greek life have a say in constructing guidelines for appearance.
“A huge core component known throughout the Greek system is that the top houses base their selections for their house primarily on appearance,” said a member of a USC sorority, who wished to remain anonymous. “Alpha Chi is trying to raise its status by doing the only thing that seems to have success, which is to fill its house with girls that all look the same and act the same.”
The emphasis on perfect physical appearance, then, is a phenomenon that stretches across Greek life. More disturbingly, physical perfection appears to be interlaced with conformity. And though conformity — whether in the form of matching tank tops with Greek letters or gaggles of sorority girls making Greek hand signs — pulses into the subtle underlying framework to interactions within Greek life on campus, it’s also surprising, considering that USC is one of the greatest champions of diversity. In a place that so greatly celebrates the unique abilities and backgrounds of every student, it is almost counterintuitive to advertise a superficial sameness instead of honoring the unique and delightful women that sororities contain. But perhaps the idea of commonality, and not differences,  draws people to Greek life to begin with.
But the worship of physical perfection among sororities is disconcerting, because physical appearance appears to precede intelligence, integrity, compassion and sisterly bonding as criteria for being a sorority sister. Sororities are filled with intelligent and compassionate people — but because a Greek system controlled by no one dictates status based on physical appearance, dress code and hairstyles become paramount to distinguish the haves from the have-nots. And somehow, this superficial distinction is supposed to signal the sisterhood in which some of a recruit’s deepest human bonds could potentially be created.
To be fair, superficiality is not so much a Greek issue as it is an issue of human nature. After all, as an Incognito study shows, women only need 20 seconds to pass judgement on other women, and the first judgement is usually based on the waistline.
And so a lifelong sisterhood should fly in the face of superficiality. Yet there persists a weird hypocrisy between the idea of a self-esteem affirming sisterhood and the requirement that that sisterhood is contingent upon a certain physical appearance. If the institutionalized friendship of sororities relies on the bond of acceptance and the freedom to show and explore one’s identity, then it cannot require a sister to be someone other than herself. And in a world already riddled with ridiculously unrealistic expectations of beauty for young women, the necessity for physical perfection is conducive to unhealthy body image while simultaneously inhibiting personal and professional growth.
To be part of a formal commitment between women, simply for the sake of it, is a beautiful thing. But the glass image of sisters supporting each other does not come without rough edges. It is imperative to respect, promote and wholeheartedly glorify the awesome new pixie cut or avant garde fashion choices of our sisters — but as women, it is perhaps more imperative to stop judging each other at all.

When I tell people that I take public transportation, I am often met with worried stares. After all, urban centers have a pretty bad reputation when it comes to sexual harassment. I’ve bought into the warnings I’ve received about riding at night and having pepper spray on hand. If Los Angeles had introduced a women-only train car, I would’ve spent way more time in the city and much less time on public transportation worried about the length of my skirt.

Unfortunately, my fear is far from irrational. In metropolitan cities around the globe, harassment is a serious issue for female commuters. A 2014 Thomas Reuters Foundation poll revealed that 32 percent of women in London have experienced verbal harassment on public transportation. The situation is even worse in Latin American cities, where six out of 10 women have reported physical assault on public transit. Given all this abuse, it is no wonder that many countries — including Japan, Mexico and Brazil — have introduced women-only train cars in an effort to curb the abuse.
Kathmandu is the latest city to adopt gender-segregated public transport. The city launched a women-only minibus service this month, providing women commuters with a haven from verbal and physical abuse. This new initiative is due in part to a recent World Bank survey revealing that 25 percent of young Nepalese women have experienced sexual harassment on public transportation. Bearing these global statistics in mind, women-only transit seems like a rational response. This type of response, however, can only go so far; shielding women in this way shifts the blame to victims and will only further exclude women from public spaces.
In a Jan. 7 article for The Guardian, columnist Jessica Valenti responds to Kathmandu’s initiative, pointing out that “gender-segregated public transport can only help women for the length of one commute.” Valenti goes on to note that “sexual harassment isn’t limited to confined spaces and can’t be eliminated by buying an automobile, even if you can afford one.” It is unrealistic to segregate every aspect of public life, so this cannot possibly be the answer to ending this epidemic. After all, public transport is only one setting for sexual harassment, and some degree of male interaction is all but inevitable.
Moreover, this segregation further removes women from the public sphere, fueling the idea that these spaces belong to men. Global Voices discussed the continuing harassment of women on Delhi’s Metro system, despite efforts to designate women-only seats. Statistics revealed the futility of gender segregation, and the seating situation itself reeks of an underlying gender hierarchy. Indeed, the four women-only seats per train car are lumped together with the four seats reserved for the disabled and elderly, as if being female is a handicap. The article includes one blogger’s observation that “women’s use of public spaces is seen as a privilege, or even as an encroachment into men’s spaces.”
Of course, this is only one country, but male entitlement to public spaces is no isolated cultural phenomenon. One look at the Tumblr “Men Taking Up Too Much Space on the Train” is enough to demonstrate the prevalence of  “public assertions of privilege” in Europe and the United States. The Huffington Post points out, “the men photographed … aren’t doing anything malicious, but it’s an interesting visual representation of the way that men feel totally empowered to take up a lot of public space — and women often do not.”
With all these displays of male privilege making headlines, the fact that women are the main users of public transport in most urban centers comes as quite a surprise. The United Nations Women website explains this phenomenon, pointing out that women and girls are more likely to move through cities in “criss-crosses and zigzags” in order to accomplish their duties as primary caregivers and members of the labor force. This misperception is a huge part of the problem; no government can adequately cater to female riders if they’re wrongly viewed as a handicapped minority. Moreover, women should not shoulder the blame for this epidemic, especially if victimized female riders outnumber the perpetrators. Women should not need to adjust their transportation routine to accommodate assailants, and they should not face victim-blaming if they reject available segregated transportation. Society needs to view women-only transit for what it is — a temporary fix, one more “You should have …” when the next victim speaks out.
