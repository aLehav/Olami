Every USC fan should take pride in Devon Kennard. 
Kennard has quietly been one of the best athletes — and people — that the Trojan Family can claim as one of their own. Quietly is the key word though — Kennard gets less recognition than other USC alumni. 
So why has a hero fallen below our gaze? 
He is a decorated football player, a successful academic and one of the NFL’s most generous philanthropists. He exemplifies what it means to be a Trojan, overcoming physical challenges with a fighting spirit, winning attitude and a heart that gives back. 
Trojan fans should know. They have witnessed his excellence since he was the second-best high school prospect to come to the Trojans in 2009. His career at USC had an exciting first season, when he made the Pac-10 All-Freshman first team and won USC’s John McKay award, given to the underclassman with the most competitive spirit. 
His next two seasons were productive, but he sat out the 2012 season with an injury. Yet, instead of allowing himself to be discouraged by his injury, Kennard saw an opportunity to redshirt that season and retain a year of football eligibility. 
He returned to the team in 2013 – his best season yet – and finished the season on the All-Pac-12 second team in a bowl-winning season.
He went on to complete his master’s degree in communication management with a focus in business management. 
It would be logical to assume Kennard was a top prospect in the 2014 NFL Draft considering the resume he built in school, and indeed, scouts were impressed by his intangible leadership and professionalism. 
However, they were concerned by his physical attributes, namely his lack of explosiveness and body length and injury history. He fell to the fifth round, where he was drafted 174th overall by the New York Giants. 
Football is certainly a contact sport where physical gifts can be advantageous, but the physical nature of the sport can cause scouts to overlook an athlete’s attitude, which usually turns out to be even more important. 
Kennard’s character has carried him to successes no one thought he could have achieved. He immediately outplayed the scouts’ projection that he would be on the bench or practice squad, becoming a starter before the end of his rookie season. He continued to start his entire Giants career, through the 2017 season. 
He signed with the Detroit Lions in 2018, and  was immediately voted team captain by his new teammates. He remained team captain in 2019 and was even his team’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award nominee, an award that recognizes one player from each team every season who teammates believe is most exemplary in their off-the-field charity work.
During his time in Detroit, he created the Devon Kennard Scholarship Fund for underserved youth in association with the Midnight Golf Program, was instrumental in the launch of the Lions’ social justice initiative Detroit Lions Inspire Change and volunteered at the “Hogs and Dawgs” Lineman Academy. 
Kennard has enjoyed a career of success while being a role model, and his master’s degree has led to a second career in real estate investing. 
He’s a USC football great on and off the field. 
However, you won’t find Kennard on lists of the top 10 USC athletes or even the top 50 USC football players of all time. So, again, why isn’t he a household name when his career is so remarkable?
Kennard has been a star his whole NFL career, but for subpar franchises who have endured several losing seasons. It’s difficult to recognize individual greatness in an unremarkable group. In addition, Kennard has always dealt with injuries, but a few absences shouldn’t make it difficult to appreciate his play when he is healthy. 
It is especially hard to understand why his name isn’t mentioned among the greats of USC when his character should stand out among so many other USC athletic alumni who were infamous for difficult demeanors or allegations of immoral behavior. So, the question becomes rhetorical. Why isn’t Kennard one of our heroes? 
Kennard, being a person of character, is probably content with flying under the radar, but humble people are exactly the kind of people who should be celebrated. 
Maybe 2022 will be the year Kennard’s greatness is fully recognized. 
He is playing in his home state with the Arizona Cardinals; he has an opportunity to be a leader on a young, exciting team that could make a deep playoff run and most importantly, he’s in a prove-it year. His contract expires after this season, so he needs to play at a high level to entice the Cardinals or another team to sign him in 2023. 
Luckily, Kennard has been showing since 2013 that he’s at his best when he has something to prove. 
It’s yet another admirable trait of his.

In a state with a storied history of wildfires throughout its coasts and forests, researchers within the UCLA Department of Geography published research Feb. 17 about the future of California wildfire seasons and conditions. Composed of new information on the changing climate in both the northern and southern parts of the state, the research looks to serve as an advocate for bolder and more innovative actions to combat climate change in the USC community and beyond. 
Analyzing data dating back to 1975, the team found a wide disparity between the amount of area burned in Northern and Southern California. In the northern coastal regions and Sierra Nevada area, there has been a significant increase in acres burned over the last two fire seasons; meanwhile, the south region showed no trend of annual acre increases.
Glen MacDonald, UCLA Department of Geography professor and co-author of the study, said the inspiration for the research stemmed from the team’s practice in studying climate change differences between Northern and Southern California, particularly through contrasts in vegetation and wildfire risk conditions. 
“Here, in Southern California, we’re mainly dealing with shrubland and grassland, coastal sage scrub and chaparral, but you can’t treat that the same way you would forested fuels like you would get up in Northern California, or in the Sierra Nevada where you have forested ecosystems,” MacDonald said. “How you manage those fuels is very different between Northern and Southern California.”
The two regions also contain differences when it comes to fire ignition sources, MacDonald said. In more forested areas in the north, fires generally occur less often, but the region’s greater frequency of lightning strikes could start a fire. In the south, fires occur more frequently on account of the environment’s flammable brushland and a higher likelihood that a human source will start the wildfire because of the high population. 
“The distinct fire frequency changes in the same state have implications in understanding the role of climate and fuels as drivers of wildfire risk in California,” the study read. Such findings have had policy and environmental experts looking to the past for answers. 
Rebecca Miller, an expert on wildfire policy and postdoctoral scholar with the the West On Fire project at the Huntington USC-Institute on California and the West, said that about 95% of wildfires are caused by humans, especially as more people move to and build in wildlands. Additionally, fire suppression efforts in the state have changed the frequency of natural wildfires — there is an increased amount of time between fires that can be up to three times as long as it should be.
The history of fire suppression efforts by the United States Forest Service throughout the 20th century is a key factor when considering these altered fire intervals, Miller said.
“The goal was to keep fires as small as possible under the incorrect belief that fires were bad for ecosystems,” Miller said. “Fire has many benefits to our ecosystems, whether it’s soil rejuvenation or the spreading and germination of plants.”
Fire suppression efforts have also contributed to an overgrowth of flammable vegetation that typically clears out within regular fire events.
The ongoing climate change crisis adds additional layers to efficiently managing wildfires in future seasons. Calculations of global warming scenarios predict the average temperature in Southern California to increase by approximately nine degrees by the year 2100 — a significant increase in temperature that may translate to wildfire risk seasons doubling in the amount of days, beginning earlier and ending later each year, according to study projections.
“There’s two big messages: one, if we start decreasing the amount of greenhouse gasses we put out — and that’s going to really require global effort — we will curtail the risk of wildfire here in Southern California. If we start now, we can do that,” MacDonald said. “But the second thing is that wildfires are just a natural part of the ecosystem and the climate system here in Southern California, and it’s going to get worse.”
MacDonald said that these climate predictions should help Californians and others better understand the future of climate conditions and preventive actions to avoid catastrophic damages to the environment.
“I’m hoping that our study will not scare people and be ‘doom and gloom’ but will say this is a really serious problem,” MacDonald said. “It’s getting worse, and it’ll spur people to think about innovative ways to decrease our vulnerability and innovative ways to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions.”

On Feb. 24, ITS withdrew two-factor authentication from Trojan Check and Blackboard for students, excluding student workers and employees taking classes.
Duo was implemented on Jan. 20 as a requirement for all students signing in through the NetID process. Duo offers three options when students log in: “Send Me a Push,” “Call Me” and “Enter a Passcode,” which verifies that the individual logging in has access to the mobile device linked to the account, increasing the likelihood that the correct user is signing on. The provision was found necessary by the University as a cybersecurity safeguard to defend private information against ransomware attacks.
Amid the Undergraduate Student Government elections in February, write-in ticket Safal Mengi and Kyle Valdes distinguished themselves through their three-week implementation plan for limiting the requirement of Duo two-factor authentication. The ticket wanted to expand the timeframe that a user’s login is remembered from eight hours to 24 hours and limit the Duo requirement to USC NetID Gmail sign-in. 
Ryan Christian, a sophomore majoring in business administration and a student worker at the Leventhal School of Accounting, said she agrees with the University’s decision to limit the Duo requirement, but retain it for student workers.
“When you’re a student worker, you have to deal with a lot more things first hand — especially school related,” Christian said. “[When] helping out professors and things like that, you can tell they really want things to be extremely secure so that information doesn’t get to the wrong people and isn’t miscommunicated to the student body.”
Mengi connected with Robert Lau, the chief information security architect at USC ITS, and examined the University’s cybersecurity insurance policy through a class he took with Zivia Wilson Sweeney, an associate professor of clinical accounting. Mengi, Valdes and Lau collaborated, which led to the formation and circulation of a petition that called for Duo’s limitation. 
“We successfully advocated for two-factor authentication to only take place when logging into Gmail,” said Mengi in a Feb. 18 interview with the Daily Trojan ahead of the USG election. “Our cybersecurity insurance actually requires us to have two-factor authentication, so I took a closer look at the contract and noticed that it said it was only for Gmail.”
Sweeney said that she strives to create a learning environment where issues important to students, such as eliminating Duo, are also important to her.
“I called [Lau] and had a really nice talk … He goes, ‘Look, you know, [the students] are our clients,’ which was so refreshing because I’ve worked with IT departments and sometimes they don’t view the end user as a client, but in this situation, [it’s] very professional.”
Mengi said the change would reduce foot traffic at Trojan Check campus entry points, as there would be less students holding up the line while trying to log into their Trojan Check app with Duo. Crowds of students waiting in line for Trojan Check, he said, increase risks related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Emery Ogah, a sophomore majoring in business administration and a student worker at the Leventhal School of Accounting, said he’d like to have a longer time period after completing two-factor authentication before he has to complete it again because he said the process is “tedious” for him.
“I find it very annoying … but I think it’s for protection,” Ogah said. “They should make it like if you signed in one time, you[‘re] good on all your devices, at least for today, because I’d be signed in three times in the span of 15 minutes.”
Christian said the adjustment to the two-factor authentication requirement offers a precaution to secure information while being convenient for students.
“It’s sometimes annoying to have to repeat the process of going through two-factor [authentication]. But, essentially, I like that it’s being limited to Gmail only,” Christian said. “I feel like it’s super nice to have your emails extremely secured and very protected in that way.” 
Sweeney said she is satisfied with the change her students’ petition brought about.
“I feel like I stood up for my students. I addressed something that was important for them, which is, I believe, a big part of my role as faculty member and I’m glad to know I played a small part in getting a big process changed,” Sweeney said.

Why worry about looking for spring break plans when you should be looking for a job? The material girl lifestyle doesn’t pay for itself, and the internship definitely won’t recruit itself either. While I am a Marxist at heart, we have to deal with the cards we’ve been dealt with, and unfortunately, that means a life of toiling for a check.
With a competitive post-college job market, our generation has to be built to withstand the most sweat-inducing interviews, create the sexiest resumes and write the cringiest LinkedIn posts just to get by. As much as I despise internship recruitment and job hunting, Dr. Blingspice has you covered with all your employment concerns to make sure you can get your bag and afford your daily Dulce breakfast burritos.
I’ve applied to dozens of internships, but I’m really worried that I won’t receive a job offer from any of the companies I applied to. I haven’t received any callbacks. What should I do?
Our generation has brewed up an unhealthy job search environment that makes us have to work 10 times harder for the simplest roles. There’s just one thing to remember — all experience is good experience, as long as it’s paid.
If you’re unable to land an internship, find a different job that’s not particularly related to your field or take your time to improve your life skills to make yourself more marketable, whether it’s crocheting or building a rocket. As long as you’re getting compensated for your work and you’re finding value in what you’re spending your time on, you shouldn’t feel pressured by your peers’ Google and Microsoft internships. 
Everyone’s time will come, and one day, you too will be able to feast at the Google employee buffet.
My friends are pressuring me to use LinkedIn, but I don’t even know where to begin. Should I get LinkedIn, and how should I use it?
LinkedIn is undoubtedly the worst social media platform that exists. Why combine social media with our capitalist needs? It’s a platform filled with unnecessary boasting and corny posts about how a J.P. Morgan recruiter saved someone’s life.
Unfortunately, if you’re aspiring for a career such as business or entertainment, LinkedIn is a necessity because it makes employers at companies you’re applying to easily accessible. You can find practically anyone’s entire life story and their work on LinkedIn and gauge what kind of job you’re shackling yourself to. Employers tend to share everything from their deepest aspirations to their birth charts on LinkedIn unprovoked, and this is a major advantage.
LinkedIn is also a way to compile your best work into a public portfolio without having to purchase your own domain or design your own website. It makes your resume readily available to all your employers, haters and anyone else who is spying on your every move.
Just for the love of God, don’t purchase LinkedIn Premium. Finesse a free trial at the height of your job search, and you’ll quickly realize it serves no purpose. Use your LinkedIn to message people, avoid creating a corny post unless you have to and girl boss your way up to 500+ connections.
I recently got an interview with a company, but I’m really shy and not really that great with interviews. How do you think I should prepare?
Treat interviews as you would a typical conversation, except with a little rehearsal. Run through your resume and create a few bullet points about each job experience, prepare a speech about the time you had to overcome the greatest challenge of your life when you cured your best friend’s cancer and write down a witty joke. Having minimal notes deters you from a rambling session and keeps you organized in the life or death situation that is a job interview. 
It’s also not a terrible idea to keep notes on the person interviewing you. Twitter and LinkedIn stalking can go both ways — you can dig up information on employers the same way they scavenge for information about you. Did your interviewer tweet about their love for Nicki Minaj? If they did, find a way to talk about “Pink Friday” and create an unforgettable bond that will inevitably shift the trajectory of their decision.
Throughout the interview, find ways to make the interviewer like you beyond just your skills. They’re looking for someone with a personality (unless you’re applying for an objectively boring company and position). Outshine everyone, and remember that you’re more than just your work.

USC will extend men’s basketball Head Coach Andy Enfield’s contract, Athletic Director Mike Bohn announced in a media release Wednesday. The contract will last until the 2027-28 season. 
The decision follows USC’s winningest regular-season record in program history, as the Trojans achieved 25-6 overall record and entered the Pac-12 tournament as the No. 3 seed. In the 2020-21 season, USC managed a 25-8 overall record and reached the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 20 years. The Trojans currently rank No. 21 in the country. 
Should Enfield see out the contract extension, he would become the second-most tenured coach in program history behind Forrest Twogood’s stewardship from 1950 to 1966. Enfield has also tied the NCAA Tournament appearances record under one head coach in program history with three total so far. 
“I am so proud of the success our players have had on the court and academically,” Enfield said in the media release. “I also want to acknowledge how fortunate I am to be surrounded by outstanding coaches and staff, and would like to recognize our fans and students because their enthusiasm and energy have been tremendous assets.”
USC’s 2022 recruiting class is currently ranked No. 6 in the nation, according to 247Sports. The program has produced several NBA Draft lottery picks in the previous few years, with the likes of forwards Onyeka Okongwu and Evan Mobley selected by the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively, in the last two drafts. Five Trojans have drafted into the NBA during Enfield’s tenure. 
Enfield broke the record for the longest winning streak versus crosstown rivals UCLA, as he managed five consecutive victories with USC’s 67-64 win over the Bruins at Galen Center Feb. 12. The win edged the previous record of four wins in a row from 2015 to 2017 and 2008 to 2011. 
“In our three years working together, our men’s basketball program has enjoyed unprecedented success and the national landscape of college basketball has taken notice,” said Bohn in the release. “That is a testament to Andy’s leadership of the program, our coaches and support staff and our talented basketball players.”
Enfield’s Trojans will face Washington for the Pac-12 Tournament Thursday at 8:30 p.m. in Las Vegas.

I could never imagine myself in a stuffy office wearing an uncomfortable pantsuit and heels every day — partially because it’s not my personal style, and I don’t understand the necessity to perform this false persona in the first place. 
Growing up in a low-income family, I never quite understood what it meant to be professional and watching YouTube videos on “How to Interview Well” could only take me so far. I had a distinct disadvantage when it came to job, scholarship and college interviews — it’s difficult to compete with people who have been gaining experience and rehearsing the metaphorical script their entire lives.
The semantics visually putting my best foot forward in the workplace was, at best, stupid and at worst, something more insidious. From implicit bias to socioeconomic inequality, the embarrassing range of obvious disadvantages shows we need to reevaluate everything that we consider “professional.”
Directly following my first internship interview, I drove home and tore off my frumpy looking secondhand interview clothing and just cried. I felt so unsightly and out of place after being in a sea of polished and expensive-looking interviewees. I was chock-full of shame in my ill fitting hand-me-down blazer, but this is exactly how the system of American professionalism intended to make me feel. Those from low-income communities were never even a consideration, and the exclusive design of professionalism makes us feel insecure, regardless of how qualified we are in actuality.
Research from The Gallup Center for Black Voices found that one in four Black and Latinx employees experienced overt workplace discrimination in the past year alone — a disturbing figure that fails to account for other communities of color and their experiences with workplace discrimination. It’s hard to pinpoint why these experiences occur, but let’s start with implicit bias.
First impressions are everything, especially at work. However, workplaces often fail to acknowledge how implicit bias stemming from conceptions of professionalism hurts potential candidates of color.
With employment prospects looking as bleak as they already do for people of color, there remains the need to address how the effects of implicit bias bleed into day to day employment. The Gallup Center reports that one in three Black adults have experienced microaggressions in the workplace where they cite instances of overt disrespect, attitudes of superiority and fear toward the individual. Working alongside racist and classist individuals is alarmingly common and many workplaces continue to turn a blind eye to anything that is not undisguised racism.
According to Fortune magazine, nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies are headed by white male CEOs. The discrepancy in diversity in highly sought-after companies begins to make sense as white male CEOs find it easier to hire people who look, act and think like them. Exclusively hiring individuals that are similar to us in background, appearance or interests is a shining and rather overt example of affinity bias. 
It is becoming increasingly customary for employers to seek out fellow alumni to hire at their companies, and although this means good job prospects for students attending prestigious universities, this kind of recruiting once again puts low-income Black and Indigenous people of color at an unfair disadvantage.
Prestigious institutions are inherently elitist, from their expectations of academic and extracurricular rigor to the actual price tag of aforementioned institutions. These recruiting practices assume that any other candidate is automatically “second rate.” Going to a prestigious university does not mean that a student is automatically deserving or of a certain caliber — for example, the entirety of the Varsity Blues scandal. Likewise, it also does not mean  that students who do not attend prestigious institutions are not any less deserving of plentiful job prospects.
Seeking employment is already hard enough even with a degree from a top university. Having to jump through hoops such as implicit bias, professionalism standards and classism just to gain admission is modern-day personal hell for low-income Black, Indigenous and people of color. Having to adhere to certain behaviors and still not having any guarantees of success is extremely disheartening and exhausting. Addressing these practices is a step, albeit a tiny one, to fix a rigged system that never intended communities of color to succeed professionally.

It’s a situation we’ve all felt before: You’re sick of listening to the same songs on repeat and looking for something new. You open your Discover Weekly playlist and sift through every song suggested but nothing catches your ear so you go back to your same rotation. Or maybe you wake up to find the entire site is offline, like it was Tuesday morning. Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t find new artists.
Algorithm got you down? It’s time to break the cycle. As you read on, you’ll find four musicians who are true to themselves while innovating in their field. Give them a try, and you might just find your newest obsession.
Yola
Dubbing herself “genre-fluid,” this British artist defies categorization. Throughout her newest album “Stand for Myself,” Yola dips into sounds of groovy disco and funk as well as more grounded, soulful blues and folk. But, if you’re looking for a more traditional, country sound, look no further than her debut album “Walk Through Fire.” No matter the style she’s exploring, Yola’s messages stay rooted in feminine power and authenticity. 
With only two albums and an EP in her discography, Yola has already received nominations for six Grammy awards. Listeners will also want to hop on the Yola train now as she prepares for her upcoming portrayal of Sister Rosetta Tharpe in  Baz Luhrmann’s upcoming Elvis Presley film.    
Rina Sawayama
What if Britney Spears wrote a song about the debilitating excess of capitalism backed by hard rock guitars? This Japanese British artist has the answer in her lead single “XS.” The lead single of her debut album “SAWAYAMA,” the song features this artist singing in a sarcastic tone, mocking our society’s values of greed with lyrics like “Cartiers and Tesla Xs / Calabasas, I deserve it.” 
In the last several years, she’s released multiple singles, an EP, an album, and she’s not stopping at the bounds of music. She’s fought for and achieved more equity in the BRIT awards, causing them to change their rules to include British artists born outside the country, and next year, she’ll be in the new John Wick film alongside Keanu Reeves. Although her career has just started, Sawayama is already collaborating with industry legends, including Lady Gaga, and even has a single featuring Elton John.
Adam Melchor
Mellow, sweet and simple: This American singer-songwriter is making music from his heart. His vocals soar over acoustic guitar licks, playing with vocal effects and harmonies in intricate and unique ways. Mostly about love and heartbreak, Melchor’s music resembles a warm summer night or falling in love by a campfire as you look at the stars. If you like the sounds of indie-pop folk artists such as Phoebe Bridgers, Melchor’s music will be right at home in your playlists. 
You may know this artist from his viral hit, “Real Estate,” but follow him on Instagram and TikTok, and you’ll be treated to surprise live streams where he plays requests and serenades his viewers. He’s yet to release his debut album, but his mixtape “Melchor Lullaby Hotline, Vol. 1” is a great place to start. Challenging himself to write a song every week in the pandemic, this mixtape compiles his 12 favorites. Look out for standout tracks “Start Forgetting Death” and “Moon In The Morning.”
Imogen Heap
What do Ariana Grande, Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo and countless other artists have in common? They’ve all sampled British artist Imogen Heap in their music. You may not know her name, but you’ve definitely heard her voice in Derulo’s 2000s smash hit “Whatcha Say” where the bridge of her song “Hide and Seek” is sampled for the chorus. 
Making her way into the music industry in the late ’90s and early 2000s, Imogen Heap is dubbed as a pioneer in pop music. Since then, she’s provided her unique brand of shiny, intertwining, harmony-stacked pop while innovating in electronic music. One of her innovations is “Mi.Mu,” a brand of “smart gloves” used to compose, control and perform aspects of a song using hand gestures. Grande even used these onstage in her 2015 Honeymoon tour.
If you want in on this hidden gem of the music industry, look into Heap’s breakthrough album, “Speak for Yourself.” After that, try her most recent project: composing the score for “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”

Let’s be transparent: When it comes to studying, sometimes you crave a specific space that allows you to stay focused, has multiple uses and is comfortable to stay at. This helps avoid having to move from place to place to fit your needs. However, at USC, it’s difficult enough to even try to find a place to sit, let alone fit such accommodations. 
According to USC’s Facts and Figures of the 2021-2022 academic cycle, there are around 21,000 undergraduate students and 28,500 graduate students. This totals to a student body of 49,500.
Putting those statistics into perspective, one would understand why it’s difficult to find an outdoor study space when weather conditions are desirable. This signals a demand for more outdoor spaces, but ones that satisfy versatility and comfort.
While the white canopies are spread around the campus in an effort to create more outdoor spaces, they don’t necessarily meet all student needs. For students, the spaces themselves aren’t the most comfortable. Their electronic usage is limited due to a lack of outlets, and, with just plain tables and chairs, there’s not much that can be done in cases where students may need to charge their electronic devices. 
With the increase in digital use due to coronavirus and virtual modalities, it’s important for universities like USC to pay attention to the growing technological paradigm. This means ensuring that students can mentally and physically take care of their wellbeing and have the resources they need to support that. Research from a collaborative study out of UMD and Cornell University in 2020 has shown that by simply having some exposure to nature, positive impacts can be seen in regards to mental health.
The study goes on to discuss that students in American colleges and universities tend to experience higher levels of stress, depression and other psychological conditions. Researchers propose that the idea of nature therapy, which is the exposure to nature, can actually help improve the lives of college students. If institutions can implement programs creating more green spaces, significant improvements in mental health would be seen. Both programs incorporate clinicians prescribing people to spend time in nature. 
The University of Arizona even acknowledged some of the benefits of studying or working outside. Such benefits include having a natural boost of energy, an increase in problem solving, improved moods and better teamwork skills. 
That is where expanding versatile and comfortable spaces comes in. Potential Ideas for versatile spaces would include having furniture such as seating cubes that can be moved around and assembled as one pleases, or even having different types of furniture within one space. Incorporating different types of tables such as ones with wheels, low platforms and high platforms, would also benefit the outdoor space. The University can also add on essentials such as movable outlet pillars. 
When considering the health benefits of introducing more green spaces in an individual’s daily life, people can clearly see that such changes towards versatility and comfortability can make a huge difference. This is why USC should consider creating more outdoor spaces that have the potential of improving the wellbeing of its student body. While students have Leavey and Doheny Library, we all need a little more sunshine while we work.

Are the jokes that we’re in the worst timeline obsolete? Out of date? Not in the timeline or feed anymore? I don’t know — and frankly, the idea of writing my silly goofy column seems a little bit weird in the face of everything. 
Things feel weird right now. They feel wrong — as if we should only be watching the news and donating to organizations and protesting at the Wilshire Federal Building, and not being like AnnaLynne McCord. I wish that we weren’t in this timeline. 
If I could choose any timeline to time travel to, I would go back to the summer of 2016. I remember it being blazing hot in California and reaching the triple digits. I remember that Sia’s “Cheap Thrills” was inescapable, and I remember people regularly getting trampled on their way to PokéStops. For a second, I think that people genuinely thought that Pokémon Go would bring world peace. The Instagram feeds were saturated and filled with white borders, and it was the year that the Starbucks mobile order feature was unveiled. Frankly, that entire world seems very, very far away. 
Recently, I told a friend, “Have I told you about my Spotify playlists?” and she didn’t even have to think twice when she said, “You mean your little time travel machines?” 
Maybe I’m repeating myself too often with friends, but these are perhaps the magnum opuses of my school years. My little Spotify folder is filled with playlists ranging from my freshman year of high school to my current senior year at USC. Each one is filled with songs that I listened to from August to around May or June of that school year. It’s amazing how I can listen to “Rather Be” by Clean Bandit and immediately be back in gym class my freshman year of high school or “Doom Days” by Bastille and remember the first time I stepped foot onto USC’s campus my sophomore year of college. It’s time travel without the hassle of needing to learn math and science, and now that Spotify brought back the lyric feature, I can learn all the lyrics that I used to mumble. 
I’ll start off by taking time travel literally. I remember being on vacation to San Diego, seeing the ocean from my window on a quintessentially beautiful California day and still being unable to put down my book. That’s how addicting it was. That book was none other than “Ruby Red” by Kerstin Gier, translated from German to English and fully immersive. “Ruby Red” might read a bit young to you because it was written for a young adult audience, but don’t count it out for that reason. The plot of the novel is that one day, 16-year-old Gwenyth Shepard feels dizzy and then finds herself rocketing through time and learns that she inherited the “time travel gene” that is passed down through her family. There is family drama, famous locales and a hint of romance. It is the young adult time travel novel you never knew you wanted. 
“The Starless Sea” is a second gift to the world from “The Night Circus” author Erin Morgenstern. It was described by writer Chuck Wendig as “narrative ASMR.” I’m including Morgenstern’s sophomore novel in this week’s column because the book itself travels through different spaces and transports you through the narrative. 
I don’t think anyone could reasonably construct a good synopsis for Morgenstern’s “The Starless Sea,” but I always love to attempt a futile project, so I’ll try. Essentially, a man named Zachary Ezra Rawlins picks up a book filled with far-flung stories — that we also explore throughout the story, hence, time travel — and flips to a page that features a story about him. Of course, like any reasonable person, he was curious as to why his life was etched in the pages of this weird book, and as he tries to find answers, he falls into the world of the Starless Sea. The novel is, of course, lyrical and is a fitting comeback for Morgenstern, whose book before that came out in 2011. Of course, I don’t know a single person who wouldn’t want to fall through a door and into an infinite library (I know that I would jump at the chance).
Speaking of falling, I think that a lot of people fall into Fredrick Backman’s “Anxious People” because they think, “Hey, I’m an anxious person!” which honestly is a legitimate reason. But there are so many other reasons to pick it up, one of them being how Backman really dives into humanity and why people do what they do in their lives. As for the time travel element, there is no linear timeline here. We dig into the lives of our characters as if we were excavators on a construction site. We backtrack to their childhoods or where they were that morning. If it were not done so skillfully, it would feel jarring as if the reader were on a roller coaster. “Anxious People” sees eight strangers held hostage at an open house in a Swedish apartment. Backman’s writing is, in equal measure, hilarious and heart-wrenching. I decided to put “Anxious People” as my final book of the column because there is one major message in the story: Be compassionate. We don’t know what’s going on in any of the characters’ lives until they peel back their onion layers. We don’t know what made them decide to go to that apartment on that day and not the previous day, nor the apartment down the street. 
So, as we navigate all of our different timelines — the good and the bad — and all of our different responsibilities and all of the different people in our lives that we dote upon, be kind and enjoy your spring break.

On Feb. 24, 2022, I opened up my New York Times morning newsletter to see the following words:
“Good morning. Russia has launched a major invasion of Ukraine. Here’s the latest.”
News outlets everywhere were flooded with similar headlines as Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a war with Ukraine, which he had the nerve to call a “special military operation.” As journalists did and continue to keep the world informed on this devastating war, a much less traditional type of coverage, TikTok, has become another source for updates. 
Ukrainian refugees are using TikTok to document their experiences during the war, spending time in bomb shelters to looking outside at the destruction Putin has brought to their homes. 
One user in particular, Valerish (@valerissh), has caught the attention of news channels everywhere because of the daily videos she posts about her experiences in Ukraine. One of her videos, titled “A typical day in a bomb shelter,” amassed 31.5 million views.
In the video, she shows clips of what has become her new routine: Her dad jokingly calls her a “fat pig;” her mom cooks; her dog is confused as to why they are living in a new place and her family goes outside to get a few items from their home while also checking to see what Putin has done to their city. 
In another video, Valerish shows what it is like to buy food from the supermarket during the war. The video pans through a desolate market with empty shelves and fridges. 
Similarly, VICE News correspondent Matthew Cassel
(@matthewcassel) has used TikTok to document his experiences as a member of the press in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. 
On Feb. 23, he posted a TikTok of the sights and sounds in the city as Russia began its war on Ukraine. Air raid sirens play loudly as haunting background music to his commentary on the beginning of the war. 
In contrast, many Ukrainian people have also posted videos of the beauty of their country as it existed before the war. TikToker @wanderiehippie shared her days spent in Odessa, Ukraine, atop the sounds of Tom Odell’s song, “Another Love.”
On the other side of the world, it is easy to have only come to know or recognize Ukraine in relation to Russia and this war, but it is much more than that. @wanderiehippie plays wonderful homage to the everyday moments in Ukraine: its grand architecture, the serene coast, the street music and the days out in the park or cafes. 
Of course, it is not ideal to get all of your information or news from social media, but these TikToks are very important for people around the world to see. They connect us to a starkly unfiltered reality of what is happening in Ukraine. They connect us very directly to the people that are suffering because of a power-hungry Russian leader. 
TikTok is giving Ukrainian citizens a platform to share their experiences during the war and updates of their safety and lack thereof. 
During wars, it is so easy to get caught up in the big picture, the politics and the countries in conflict that people forget about the people whose homes are destroyed and whose families are torn apart. 
TikTok and other technology allow us to act as witnesses to the trauma of these events. Whereas before, we would have turned a blind eye or only been able to see the news that our political leaders and news outlets curated and made available. 
While there are some negatives that come from social media, I do think that there are positives. With the horrible and tragic war that is currently happening in Ukraine, TikTok has allowed refugees to share their experience and users to connect with them. Through these apps, we can raise awareness — raise our voices in protest and do all we can to support the people and country in need.
