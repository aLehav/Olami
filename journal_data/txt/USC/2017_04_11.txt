In February 2016, a vote by the faculty of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences resulted in a loss for the USC Faculty Union, a group of non-tenure-track faculty working to guarantee higher wages and benefits, which they hope to achieve by creating a labor union. More than a year later, faculty members involved are left questioning the current state of the union.
After the vote, the USC Faculty Union appealed to the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that Provost Michael Quick’s emails leading up to the vote discouraged faculty members from supporting unionization. The NLRB ruled in favor of the Faculty Union, invalidating the results of the vote and scheduling a redo.
As of September, Dornsife faculty members had filed charges against USC with the NLRB, accusing the University of unfair labor practices. They requested a delay in the upcoming unionization vote. A few months after the NLRB said there would be a new vote, its national offices reversed the decision. 
Professors are divided over the decision to sue the University. Steve Posner, assistant professor of writing is not part of the Faculty Union, but he said he follows it closely.
“I am for the union, but I do not think Michael Quick did anything improper,” Posner said. “He has stated the University’s position and has sent emails which were informative. There were no threats and there was no intimidation.” 
The Service Employees International Union was helping the Faculty Union organize. Now, the SEIU is focusing on graduate assistants who are trying to unionize.
“We’re pretty much in limbo,” said professor Sandra Marie Ross, a member of the Faculty Union.
Posner said that the approach to unionization was flawed.
“I think unionization is a good idea, but this particular union made a mistake,” Posner said. “They didn’t take the time to learn about the campus culture and the specific concerns of professors, so they weren’t able to address the concerns.”
In recent months, the Faculty Union has refrained from continuing to fight the decision.
“I would imagine the union figures this is a fight not worth pursuing,” Posner said. “I think eventually a union will come around again, and the University has an opportunity to change its policies to make a union unnecessary. So far, I don’t see that happening.”
Ross said there is increasing dominance of non-tenure-track faculty who have little job security. Yet, faculty members are left in the dark about hiring and promotion decisions.
“What we want is transparency,” Ross said. “We want to know why some non-tenure-track faculty get promoted and others don’t. We want collective bargaining, and just more accountability. We are the future of the University.”

Los Angeles Police Department officers arrested a USC student on Tuesday for alleged sexual assault, according to LAPD.
LAPD identified the student as Aarman Premjee, 20. The student directory spells his first name as Armaan. Premjee is a sophomore majoring in business administration.
The alleged assault happened on April 1 at a campus dorm, according to LAPD. Premjee was released on $100,000 bail and he has been charged with sexual assault. The arrest was made on campus at approximately 11 a.m., according to the Los Angeles Times. 
The Department of Public Safety and LAPD could not provide information about the alleged victim for privacy reasons, but both parties are undergraduates, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Thirteen cases of sexual assault were reported on campus in 2015, according to the 2016 Annual Security and Fire Safety Report.

Students gathered to learn from internationally acclaimed bassoonist Michael Ke Ma on Monday night in the MacDonald Recital Hall at 7 p.m. Ke Ma is the assistant principal bassoonist of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and an alumnus of the USC Thornton School of Music’s winds and percussion sections. Ke Ma brought his talents to USC to share his expertise with aspiring bassoonists.
The event began with Samantha Epp, a freshman majoring in bassoon performance, who was the first performer for Ke Ma. 
She chose to play the first movement of Concerto in C Major by Jan Vanhal. For 10 minutes, Epp played as Ke Ma observed her from the side of the room, listening to her play the bassoon and the piano accompaniment on the Steinway. After, Ke Ma began sharing his advice and playing along with his own bassoon to help communicate his advice. He workshopped her piece and asked her to emphasize the main beginning notes for runs and to give enough air in the beginning for sixteenth notes. 
Sloan Quessenberry, a freshman majoring in bassoon performance, played a slower melody next. Quessenberry showcased the second movement of Leopold Kozeluch’s Concerto in C Major for the audience. Ke Ma advised him to be in closer contact with the pianist while playing. The crowd was filled with fellow musicians and bassoonists for support. 
Next, Ryan Williams, a senior majoring in bassoon and music performance, played Solo de Concert Opus 35 for bassoon and piano by Gabriel Pierne. Ke Ma commented on his spiritual playing, telling him that he should play the beginning louder with the notes shorter. He commented that he was the only one playing on stage so he should be more expressive, take his time and not rush through the notes.
The final player, Anne Ranzani, a sophomore majoring in bassoon performance, played the first movement of Mozart Concerto in B-flat, one of the most famous and popular  bassoon pieces of all time, 
“Mozart is like a theme park,” Ke Ma said, prompting laughter from the audience. “Everyone is welcome to come in.”
He explained that in this piece, the beginning notes were like a ball bouncing back and forth. He demonstrated the notes himself, letting his powerful tone resonate throughout the recital hall. 
The four students were joined by five other bassoonists that showcased their skills in the master class: Amber Wyman, Jaquain Sloan, Emily Schoendorf, Andrew Favorito and Lieza Hansen. Each played six to 10 minutes from pieces by renowned composers such as Mozart, Ravel, Shoshtakovich and Beethoven. In return, they received 15 to 20 minutes of one-on-one teaching from Ke Ma. 
Ke Ma has performed and taught around the world. He first started his career in 2000 when he was appointed principal bassoon of Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2004, he was appointed the assistant principal bassoon of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
In addition to his career as a seasoned performer, Ke Ma has also taught at Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, coached private students and worked with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra’s Civic ensembles.
The event was organized by Judith Farmer, Ke Ma’s former teacher and a bassoon professor at the USC Thornton School of Music.

Better Call Saul, the spinoff show to the popular television series Breaking Bad, has returned for its third season. The first two seasons of Better Call Saul have not been a disappointment, as creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould produced some of the darkest and most humorous scenes in
 modern-day television. The third season premiere follows in this vein, reminding viewers of the emotional stakes at hand and setting the characters up for important developments later in the season.
Better Call Saul follows the growth of scam-artist-turned-lawyer Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), years before the events of Breaking Bad. McGill served as Walter White’s lawyer in the flagship show, and Better Call Saul follows his evolution from a honest but down-on-his-luck attorney to a representative for drug lords like White (Bryan Cranston). 
Throughout the show, the themes of coming-of-age, failure, doubt and respect for the law are woven into McGill’s story as he works to care for his mentally ill brother Chuck (Michael McKean) and grapples with his feelings for his love interest Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) — both of whom are ostensibly more successful than him. McGill’s frustration is palpable as he struggles to follow the rules while continually disappointing himself and the people around him. 
“Mabel,” the premiere episode, starts off with a flash forward to Goodman after the events of Breaking Bad, demonstrating how he has moved on from a life of crime but still has a soft spot for those who dance around the law. It then reverts back to 2002, when the bulk of the story is set, to continue McGill’s evolution into Goodman. In this episode, the audience sees McGill’s character development — he is not the manipulative liar from Breaking Bad, but he shows a penchant for trickery and manipulation that, like Chekhov’s gun, is sure to make an appearance later in the show. 
The show also features Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), another Breaking Bad character known for his skills as a hitman working for Goodman, in his journey from McGill’s enemy to his
partner-in-crime. The Mike storyline from the last season has been tense and lethargic — the storyline’s
payoff has not always equaled the gradual build-up of its plot. Furthermore, the music choice for Mike’s scenes left more to be desired from audiences, as the soundtrack felt melodramatic. In the premiere’s scenario, however, the suspense was well worth it, as viewers finally got the high-action scenes they were looking for. In addition, Breaking Bad fans will anticipate villain Gus Fring’s (Giancarlo Esposito) appearance this season, with his connection to Mike. 
Viewers know where McGill is going to end up, giving up a law-abiding life of mediocrity for fame and wealth as the law-breaking Goodman. The best part about watching Better Call Saul is seeing how he gets there.

I will admit: I used to be a fan of Girls. In its early days, the series was honest, messy and relentless, unlike any show about women I had seen or have yet to see. Despite the show’s many flaws, I continue to point to it as the first series I’ve watched that reflects young womanhood in all its uncertainties. Girls is the experience of white women with wealthy parents, certainly, but it reflects young womanhood all the same.
When I talk about the series’ sixth and final season with my friends, the biggest complaint I hear is that the characters have become unlikeable. The titular girls are barely even friends anymore and have descended into their own caricatures, unlike the people thought they knew. And for the most part, I reluctantly agree. I was a fan, but the show has lost me. But being unlikeable? That was never Girls’ problem. 
Think of all the television anti-heroes modern audiences have become familiar with: the Walter Whites, Tony Sopranos and Don Drapers — men either incapable of change or only bent on changing for the worse. Walter White cooks meth, causes the death of hundreds of people and poisons a child; Tony Soprano is an adulterous mobster who hides bodies with his
trash-collecting business; Don Draper is a cold, 1960s-era businessman who once stole a dead man’s identity during the Korean War.
All these characters do reprehensible things, put up walls and treat their families poorly. In fact, the more conventionally likeable characters should be their wives, whose entire arcs wrap around cleaning up and emotionally guarding the men in their lives. But still, the public loves to hate Skyler White, Carmela Soprano and Betty Draper — strong female leads in their own right whose reputations often suffer simply because they sometimes get in the way of their husbands’ goals. 
Audiences love unlikeable men: mysterious, hardened, violent individuals who do difficult things and make them look easy. And so when we say “unlikeable,” that doesn’t necessarily mean that these characters are people we don’t like. But unlikeable, in this sense, does not apply to women. The hard truth is that audiences of all genders will praise male characters for being unlikeable while decrying female characters for doing much less. 
As a female audience member, I don’t want to have to call the women in Girls unlikeable. Simply, it is so easy to call women annoying, to call them flighty and bitchy and obnoxious. But the more I descend into season six, the more I begin to realize what people mean when they say they no longer like Hannah, Marnie and Jessa. Audiences can’t like characters unless they are able to empathize with them — and as is the case for Walter, Tony and Don, the viciousness of these men’s actions are mitigated by being rooted in emotional truth. You only lose an audience when your character begins to make decisions the audiences can’t understand.
It is a hard reality to take that Girls, a show I had loved for its brutal honesty, drank too much of its own blood, grew unrecognizable and emerged back into its last season as a parody of itself. Hannah encountering her doppelganger on a brownstone stoop, Marnie continuing her torturous relationship with Desi, Jessa and Adam magically pulling funds and a camera crew out of a hat to produce a movie — these are ideas an audience could not have swallowed in season one. They are contrived emotions, characters walking in ruts. It’s what happens when writing stays in the writers’ room and doesn’t mold to what’s palatable on screen.
For that reason it pains me to watch Girls now because out of every show in my life it promised to refute the idea of the unlikable woman: to paint young women in startling clarity, doing unlikeable things and still forcing the audience to root for them anyway. But I don’t like the show anymore. And I don’t like the characters. 
I used to think that if I stuck through a series long enough, I would be happy I finished it at the end. But that implies a fault in the patience of the viewer, and this time, I don’t think this is true. Because this time, maybe I’m not the one failing Girls. Maybe Girls is failing us.

Members of the Asian American and black communities will come together to create a night of art, storytelling and unity on Friday. The Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, Undergraduate Student Government and Black Student Assembly are hosting the second SPEAK USC: Asian and Black Voices, an opportunity for artists to showcase their talents and celebrate their identities.
This event aims to bridge the gap between the Asian American community and the black community. Members of these ethnic groups share experiences, struggles and stories, but there are very few opportunities for these groups to come together and engage with each other. By providing a platform for students to express their stories through art, student organizations hope to facilitate conversations and bonds that have rarely been seen before.
The lineup for the night includes Empress Christian, a sophomore majoring in theater, will perform a short play called “Dressing” by Tala Manassah. The performance will tackle topics of race, identity and privilege. 
“As a black woman, with family and friends who inhabit black bodies, this monologue is the most difficult thing I have ever had to perform,” Christian said on the event page. “This is not a piece to be enjoyed or consumed or even understood. It is a piece that’s meant to be felt.”
Another performer on the lineup is Leo Xia, one of the organizers of the event as well as a singer-songwriter. Xia just released his first EP Hyphenated, bringing awareness to the experience of Asian American artists in the music industry. 
“Different ethnicities are pigeonholed in different ways, but for Asian Americans, we’re pigeonholed in a very specific way as the ‘model minority,’” Xia said, in an earlier interview with the Daily Trojan. “I want to tell other Asian Americans that you can actually do whatever you want to if you set yourself to it.”
According to the the L.A.-based rapper and activist’s website, “Jason Chu is on a mission to speak hope, healing, and justice in a broken world.” Chu, who will host the event, was part of the team that inaugurated the event last year. 
With increased popularity of the spoken word and social justice-oriented art, APASA, BSA and other cultural student organizations have been proactive in bringing artists to campus and giving students the opportunity to express themselves. SPEAK follows events such as performances by Alan Yang and Rupi Kaur, InspirASIAN and BSA’s CreEx initiative. In conjunction with Vision and Voices and art initiatives on campus, these groups are facilitating conversations among underrepresented voices.
SPEAK: USC has garnered a lot of student excitement as well as support from non-USC community members. These highly anticipated performances are sure to move audiences and spark emotional responses from those who attend.

In the aftermath of dropping two straight Pac-12 series to No. 7 Arizona and No. 17 Stanford — and losing six of its last seven games overall — the USC baseball team is in need of a turnaround. But the road does not get any easier this week for the Trojans (16-14), as the team collides with No. 10 Cal State Fullerton for a three-game set that kicks off on Thursday.
The series opener will be played at Dedeaux Field, but the next two clashes on Friday and Saturday will take place at Fullerton’s Goodwin Field. USC has excelled at home, boasting a 12-7 mark on the season, but has struggled on the road (3-7) with no road wins in the team’s previous five tries. 
The Trojans’ away woes have stemmed largely from an inexperienced and inconsistent pitching staff. After giving up key late-inning runs to Stanford in the two losses last weekend, the group now collectively owns a 4.50 ERA — third-worst in the Pac-12.
Despite the pitching struggles, however, there have been a few bright spots, such as freshman Chris Clarke’s seven-inning performance in USC’s 7-5 victory over the Cardinal on Thursday. 
“I think [the length] was huge because out in Arizona, everyone went five, and Mason [Perryman] went an inning and a third against Long Beach,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “When you’re going four or five innings out of the pen on a Friday, it makes it a lot more difficult.”
Clarke was happy to help the team but said he didn’t feel pressured to deliver when he toed the rubber for the series opener.
“I just told myself to go out on the mound and have fun,” said Clarke, who now owns a 3-1 record on the season.
Hubbs will need an abundance of quality innings against Cal State Fullerton. The 21-10 Titans carry a team batting average of .270 with four consistent starters hitting over .300. After losing five in a row to difficult opponents such as Long Beach State, UCLA and UC Riverside, Cal State Fullerton has righted the ship and is now riding a six-game winning streak. The Titans are first in their conference with a 5-1 record so far in Big West competition.
It remains to be seen if the Trojans can match their opponent’s lethal bats. While USC’s hitting looked dormant against national powerhouse Arizona, the bats seemed to slowly come back to life against Stanford. On Thursday’s wild slugfest, senior Cris Perez and sophomore Lars Nootbaar each hit home runs as the team scored seven runs.
For Nootbaar, his insurance blast in the eighth inning was his team-leading fifth homer of the year, which extended the Trojans’ lead to two runs. 
USC followed up that performance with 12 hits on Friday and an 11-hit game on Saturday. However, the team was unable to capitalize on its scoring opportunities, continuing similar struggles with runners in scoring position that plagued the Trojans against Arizona. 
First pitch in Thursday’s series opener is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field before the teams meet again at Goodwin Field for the final two games, which are set to begin at 7 p.m. on Friday and 1 p.m. on Saturday. 
After finishing up their three-game series against the defending Big West champions, the Trojans will look forward to a brief two-game home-and-home series with UC Irvine beginning next Monday. USC does not return to Pac-12 play until next Friday, when they travel to Berkeley to take on Cal. 
The way to bounce back is to get rid of Coach Hubbs, and get a real coach. His handling of pitchers is poor.
Why do you thing Pat Haden offered ‘ruins baseball coach John Savage $1Mil to come back to USC before
the 2016 season.

Madeleine Roche | Daily TrojanGreene corps · Injuries have forced USC to shuffle things around among its wide receivers. Junior Jalen Greene capitalized during Tuesday’s practice.
With just a few days to go before the spring game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this Saturday, the Trojans went to work at Howard Jones Field dealing with some lingering injuries on the offensive end. 
Receiver Shakeup
Junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett, redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe and junior tight end Tyler Petite all were limited in Tuesday’s practice due to recent injuries. As a result, many young pass catchers got a chance to prove themselves.
Redshirt freshman tight end Cary Angeline saw extended minutes with the first team offense, making a nice touchdown grab during the full-speed scrimmage. Junior Jalen Greene, a converted quarterback, played the majority of snaps at first-string wide receiver, lining up alongside either sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. or freshman Tyler Vaughns, who are both battling for a spot in the starting lineup.
“Those two guys are going at it,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold said. “They’ve been going at it the past few weeks, and it’s been awesome to see. Tyler [Vaughns] has really improved his route-running and [Pittman] has really improved as well. They’re going to compete all the way up until the season starts.”
The Running Game 
With injuries to the offensive line and running back corps throughout spring ball, most attention has been paid to Darnold and the passing game. On Tuesday, however, junior running backs Aca’Cedric Ware and Ronald Jones II were both back at full strength and looked sharp.
“I’m pretty sure everyone knows we can run the ball,” Ware said. “Our offensive line has continued to improve. They’re young guys who just had to get going, but I know everyone knows we can run the ball.” 
In the spring game, they will look to re-assert that the run game is an integral part of the Trojans’ offense. 
“We’re a run-first football team,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We got effective work [this spring]. I wish we had more numbers out here, but it is what it is, and we’ve made the most of it.” 
Stars Aligned 
With Athletic Director Lynn Swann, NFL Draft prospect JuJu Smith-Schuster and legendary USC and Patriots linebacker Willie McGinest all present at practice, the Trojans were treated to a star-studded audience. Earlier in the day, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was on campus training with several teammates. 
“I’ve been trying to [talk to Wilson], but he always comes when we’re in class or no one’s in the weight room,” Darnold said. “He tries to kind of avoid everyone … but I’m trying to this week before he leaves for camp. He’s one of the smartest quarterbacks in the league right now.” 
Spring Game Format 
Helton said Saturday’s spring game will focus more on in-game situations rather than simulating an actual game, due to the recent injuries the team has suffered. 
“We’re going to have to be able to play some situational football, very practice-like,” Helton said. “It will be live in a lot of the periods, [with] tackling to be able to see some young kids play in certain situations, but right now we’re just too limited to play a real live game.”
USC’s spring game is scheduled to begin at noon on Saturday.

On Monday, the soccer federations of Mexico, Canada and the United States unveiled a plan for an unprecedented bid — a proposition for a joint hosting between three countries for the 2026 World Cup.
It’s always a risky move to propose something that’s never been done before. On one hand, this proposal could be the perfect move for three countries with booming soccer scenes. But issues of game location and cross-country traveling could spell defeat for the young bid.
This isn’t the first time that multiple countries have proposed to host a World Cup together — South Korea and Japan successfully
co-hosted the tournament in 2002. But this joint bid would keep teams on the same continent and wouldn’t force fans and players alike to make long jaunts across any bodies of water to watch games.
Instead, the majority of the tournament would take part in cities across the United States, with 60 games hosted in America and the remaining 20 split up between Mexico and Canada. The United States is fresh off hosting the 2016 Copa America Centenario, which set records with a total of nearly 1.5 million fans attending the event’s 32 games.
Canada, meanwhile, saw similar success in hosting the 2015 Women’s World Cup, which broke records for overall attendance. While the host country earned some vitriol over aspects of the tournament — particularly from fans over the use of turf instead of grass — most of the issues that Canada faced would be smoothed over with the extra funding and attention of a men’s championship.
In fact, all three of these countries have set records for attendance in hosting different international soccer championships in the last decade, with Mexico playing host to the U-17 FIFA World Cup in 2011. With all of that success combined into a single package, this bid already seems like a sure thing.
Under the surface, there are still a few questions to be answered.
There is, of course, the typical slew of concerns to run through whenever a bid is proposed. How much will this cost? How will infrastructure need to be altered? How many new stadiums will have to be built? But from there, the broader implications of attempting to host a major sporting event in three separate countries begins to show the cracks in this plan.
The main issue? Travel.
Although the two soccer federations are happily participating in the creation of this bid, the relationship between the United States and Mexico isn’t at its peak currently. Regardless of whether the current political climate will have calmed down by the 2026 World Cup, the challenge of organizing travel options for massive groups of fans is tripled with the prospect of three host countries.
The countries might be able to strike a deal that would allow a temporary visa option for easy travel for teams, families and fans to move across the borders. But the added hassle could result in a drop in attendance at the games based in Mexico and Canada, with fans deciding to only invest in the bulk of the games hosted by the United States.
This would also raise another vital question of co-hosting — who gets what? If the United States is hosting the majority of the games, will Mexico and Canada split up the opening ceremony and the final match? Or will the United States remain the central hub of the event, with Mexico and Canada getting the short end of the stick with smaller games?
These are questions that haven’t been answered yet by the bid or by any of the federation presidents. While the location of these games might not seem significant, they actually point to the nature of the bid as a whole. If the United States retains the hosting privileges of the most important games, this essentially becomes another bid for the Americans after their 2022 proposition lost out to a controversial Qatar bid.
The only difference is the additional support and funding of Canada and Mexico, both of which could be convincing to the
powers-that-be at FIFA. For starters, FIFA desperately needs to make money after recent scandals lost the organization millions. The World Cup is a moneymaker, and the United States is a perfect host in a region where soccer culture is rapidly expanding.
Cooperation between the three federations is also favorable for FIFA as a whole, as it reflects a more cohesive worldwide entity that fits into the new image that FIFA President Gianni Infantino is hoping to cultivate. Infantino has been vocal about his hopes to see more shared World Cup bids moving forward.
Ultimately, however, this bid could serve as a win-win for everyone involved. With its team on a recent upswing, the United States would gain the bulk of hosting duties for the biggest event in soccer, helping to add to the momentum of the sport’s rise in American culture. Canada would earn an automatic bid to the World Cup, which the team has only qualified for once in its history, while Mexico would get the chance to prove itself as a host through a manageable amount of games.
FIFA, meanwhile, would have a surefire opportunity to rebuild the World Cup after the scandals of past bids.
The ultimate decision is still a long way off, but the prospect of filling a home stadium with the “I Believe” chant in a World Cup game is something that should excite any American soccer fan.

The MPSF awarded women’s lacrosse senior attacker Michaela Michael Player of the Week honors for the fourth consecutive week on Monday after USC cruised to two home victories over the weekend against Oregon (17-7) and San Diego State (15-3).
Michael’s fourth Offensive Player of the Week nod of the spring ties her program record for awards in a single season, which she set in 2016. Monday also marked the ninth time in her four-year career that Michael has received such recognition. Her total 10 career awards (including one Rookie of the Week nod in 2014) is also a team record.
The Hillsborough, Calif. native is enjoying the most productive offensive season of her career in 2017 (53 goals, 14 assists, .646 shot percentage), and Michael padded her impressive stats last  week in victories over the Ducks and Aztecs.
Against Oregon, Michael was as dominant in midfield as she was in the offensive zone. Her 11 draw controls put her at 93 on the year, which ranks fourth in MPSF single-season history with three games left to play before the start of postseason play.
Along with notching her eighth career double-digit draw control game, Michael also collected six goals and two assists in last Friday’s game along with a ground ball and caused turnover. 
Against San Diego State on Saturday, Michael controlled six draws and tied her career high in goals, slipping seven past Aztec goalie Katrina Reeves on just nine shots.
With 13 goals in two games, Michael earned her program-record 35th and 36th career hat tricks, and she has now scored six or more goals in the same game seven times in her career. The former High School All-American is now second in MPSF history for career goals (209) and fourth place in points (273). She is on pace to break her career bests in goals and points this season if she keeps up her historic offensive pace.
The Trojans have earned eight weekly honors in 2017, bringing their program total to 31 with 13 offensive awards, 10 defensive awards and eight rookie of the week honorees.
No. 9 USC (11-3, 5-0 MPSF) is back in action this Friday, as the Trojans will host the
sixth-ranked Colorado Buffaloes (12-1, 4-0 MPSF) at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Last week, the state of California’s judicial branch stood by its cap-and-trade pollution control measures. The Third District Court of Appeal unanimously found that the state-controlled auctions for carbon credits did not violate a California proposition requiring that two-thirds of the legislature vote in favor of any new tax. In layman’s terms, the court determined that California’s cap-and-trade environmental policy does not constitute a tax and may proceed unbridled by the restraints that such a designation would normally carry with it.
It has been determined, then, that cap-and-trade is not a tax, even though it is a set of financial incentives designed to got carbon emissions below 1990 levels by 2020. Instead of taxing polluters traditionally, California is instead requiring that polluting industries purchase pollution allowances from the state at auction. How this differs in structure from a highly complex tax is not clear at first glance, but what is clear is that cap-and-trade in California needs to be looked at with a critical eye now more than ever.
Admittedly, the world faces an environmental crisis, one that becomes much more obvious with each passing day. However, what we must recall is that the rate of carbon emission is not the sole factor that Californians should be concerned with when it comes to the state’s policy. For certain, cap-and-trade helps to reduce the amount of pollution that the state experiences; but the policy may have associated costs with it that are not immediately apparent. For example, the way that cap-and-trade is implemented may harm the profitability of prominent California businesses that use traditional energy sources or utilize heavy industry, potentially causing a jump in unemployment and a consequently larger amount of economic woes for the state of California.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Cap-and-trade in California is aimed at limiting annual carbon emissions to no more than the amount released in 1990. While that is a laudable goal that is also in line with the priorities of many members of the international community and environmentalist groups, studies point out that measures such as cap-and-trade will inevitably lead to a substantial spike in the cost of living for people who rely on energy and products created by using polluting fuels. While some may argue that can offset a greater reliance on clean energy sources like solar and wind energy, one must recall that these technologies are still quite cost-prohibitive and will require a substantial amount of time to supplant more traditional sources of energy like natural gas, which is responsible for over half of California’s electricity generation. 
In addition to the resulting short- and long-term changes in the energy sector of the economy due to cap-and-trade, the newly imposed costs of operation associated with purchasing pollution credits may lead to unemployment in the manufacturing sector, which makes up about 25 percent of the state’s economic output and is host to 8 percent of the state’s working population. In short, cap-and-trade may sound appealing for those concerned with the state’s environmental health, but it overlooks the very real effects of state-imposed costs on employers and employees if it is implemented too rigorously and too quickly.
None of this is to say that environmental concerns and public health are not important; quite the opposite is true. However, they must be balanced with the ability of the California economy to grow and develop steadily alongside the state’s burgeoning population, to say nothing of the amount of meddling with the market that cap-and-trade represents if handled poorly. Now that it has surmounted the last major legal hurdle before it, California’s cap-and-trade program must take economic effects into account before it mandates even more stringent regulations and penalties on businesses. Foreclosing job opportunities and driving up the already high cost of living in California within a short period of time would not only be counterintuitive, but also supremely unwise.

Last week, a state appeals court upheld the legality of California’s cap-and-trade emissions environmental policy. 
California’s cap-and-trade program “sets a statewide emissions limit on sources responsible for 85 percent of California’s greenhouse gas emissions.” The “cap” grants each company a wider allowance should they emit less than this cap. This policy was set in 2013; the cap for each company is set at about 2 percent below the emissions level expected for 2012, and has slightly declined each year since, with a goal of eventually returning to California greenhouse gas emissions levels in 2020.
This system sets an economic incentive for big polluters to reduce their emissions — if companies pollute less than their total allowances, they can trade more widely. However, if companies go over their allotted emissions, they are forced to buy additional allowances. Because the total allowances are “capped,” the state ensures that total emissions stay below the set limit. 
The state cannot allow polluting companies to do whatever they want and release unlimited emissions, impacting the health of California residents. Cap-and-trade is an important step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale, and decreasing negative health effects faced by local residents who live near a pollution source. 
For California, this is a win-win-win effort. Entities will reduce their emissions. The set “cap” allows the state to ensure that these reductions add up to the number that is needed and keep companies’ emissions under the intended limit. Finally, the state uses the money made by selling these allowances toward programs for additional emissions reductions. Dozens of countries have embraced cap-and-trade with great success, and if California wants to remain in the global conversation on mitigating the world’s environmental crisis, cap-and-trade policies in the state are a necessity.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
While the costs of purchasing pollution credits could possibly cause less manufacturing and labor jobs, it is unlikely that this would have a large impact. The entire idea of the cap-and-trade program is that it will allow entities to reduce emissions where it is cost-effective to do so, instead of forcing a mandatory, set limit on all entities, which would undoubtedly harm the entities which cannot afford it. Instead of being forced to meet a certain established limit, entities are still able to control their own pollution levels — to an extent. Additionally, cap-and-trade will likely add jobs in renewable energy and other fields. 
At some point or another, the world — and California — will need to start lowering emissions and transitioning to renewable energy. Even if we were fine with the harmful impacts on human health or didn’t believe in climate change, transitioning to cleaner energy is inevitable since our remaining fossil fuels are limited. Losing a few manufacturing jobs is obviously not ideal, but it also is a natural effect of transitioning to cleaner technologies that are necessary to promote health. 
California needs to put its residents’ health first, which is suffering as a result of greenhouse gas emissions. Californians experience the worst air quality in the nation, and over 95 percent of the state’s residents live in areas with unhealthy air. The annual health impacts of exceeding the state’s standards for air pollution include nearly 7,000 premature deaths, 7,000 hospital visits for respiratory or cardiovascular disease, 350,000 asthma attacks and countless others. Arguments about how cap-and-trade will reduce jobs or economically harm businesses distract from the fact that it is effective in mitigating these negative health impacts.
California’s cap-and-trade program has inspired action at the global level, and the state is now partnering with Canadian provinces to implement joint cap-and-trade programs. It also is collaborating with Mexico and China as the two nations work to price carbon. This demonstrates how the cap-and-trade program solidifies California as a global leader in environmental policy, which is even more important to our world now that the United States as a whole is falling behind in the environmental realm.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate has endorsed a new sustainability plan that aims to conserve energy and other resources on campus. 
The Sustainability 2030 Resolution passed by a unanimous vote at the USG meeting on Tuesday after an initial proposal by the Academic Senate Sustainability Taskforce. 
While USC has already adopted a Sustainability 2020 Plan, the Sustainability 2030 Resolution aims for USC to embed sustainability efforts in a broader vision and longer-term strategy and approach both long-range planning needs and short-term implementation steps. It aims to create a more specific framework toward campus sustainability, in order to create the tangible change that it claims the Sustainability 2020 Plan failed to incite.
The resolution states that its goal is for USC to be “widely recognized regionally, nationally and internationally as a leader in teaching and research on a wide range of environmental sustainability issues.” 
It calls for USC to integrate sustainability into all aspects of the University, including education and research, community engagement, energy conservation, transportation, procurement, waste and water. 
“Surveys and petitions have shown that students care about the sustainability of their campus, and yet USC still lags behind our peer institutions on almost every metric of sustainability,” Sen. Katie Bolton said. “The 2020 plan was a good start, but the new 2030 plan pushes the University to go farther and to do better.”
The new resolution calls for USC to regularly develop, lead and engage in strategic partnerships on campus and in the community to promote sustainability practices and education, as well as achieve carbon neutrality across all campus buildings. 
Another goal is for USC to reduce single occupancy vehicles by 50 percent from the 2014 levels, convert the University motor fleet to zero emissions, reduce the University’s carbon footprint by 50 percent and position USC as a visible and progressive participant in local, regional and international sustainable transportation activities. 
The plan aims for USC to be recognized as a leader among higher education institutions in using its purchasing power to encourage environmentally sustainable operations in its supply chain. 
The final goal is for USC to achieve campus-wide “zero waste” and reduce potable water usage by 50 percent from 2014 levels. 
Now that the Senate has endorsed the plan, the next step is working toward getting the Sustainability 2030 Resolution approved by the USG administration. Because it is resolution rather than a proposal, a member of USC’s upper administration, most likely from the Provost’s office, is now obliged to meet with the Academic Senate to discuss the strategy, according to Zachary Manta, the director of Environmental Core, who helped write the resolution.

Santa Monica is one of those places you absolutely must visit when you’re in Los Angeles. With its beautiful sandy beaches, its retro pier and its large selection of restaurants and shopping areas, Santa Monica is a beachfront heaven for tourists, retirees, families and college students alike.
I have lived in Santa Monica for three years now, but still I enjoy the city as if it was my first day here. I do have some favorite spots, however, and here’s a few of them.
Athena Lim | Daily Trojan
Santa Monica Pier
The pier is one of the city’s most famous attractions. With its amusement park, retro vibes and delicious food vendors, it makes a wonderful spot for hanging out or for a date. On summer nights, the pier hosts the Twilight Concerts and on fall evenings it hosts the Front Porch Cinema where you can relax and enjoy free  entertainment with your friends. Go early, though, because it can be crowded.
Athena Lim | Daily Trojan
Santa Monica Beach
Of course, Santa Monica Beach makes the list. Who can say “no” to the rolling waves, the ocean wind and the sand? The beach is just a few blocks away from downtown Santa Monica, making it the perfect spot to watch the sunset as you finish shopping.
Athena Lim | Daily Trojan
Third Street Promenade
Third Street Promenade is the place to go for shopping. It’s four whole blocks of pedestrian-friendly stores and restaurants, ending with a semi-outdoor mall. Whether you’re looking for high-end luxury goods or more affordable ones, Third Street Promenade has it all.
There are a lot of things happening in the Promenade, like the Santa Monica Film Festival, farmers markets, and Indonesian, Egyptian and Ukrainian cultural events. Don’t forget, every Sunday the promenade hosts Salsa Nights where you can dance the night away.

Main Street
Main Street is lined with boutique stores, restaurants, cafes and great bars. From well-known franchises like Urth Caffe to family-owned businesses, Main Street is sure to keep you entertained all day long.

A lot of people ask me how I can survive without carbs, sugar or sweets. As a healthy eater, I choose to fuel my body with healthy food, but as mentioned before, this was not always my lifestyle. Admittedly, I loved to indulge in candy and carbs. However, once I started eating healthy, I discovered there are endless substitutions for these common cravings. If you find yourself wanting to eat healthier, here are a few of my favorite healthy food alternatives for every meal, with a twist:
 Breakfast
Instead of cereal, try some granola and almond or soy milk. To avoid the sugary contents of regular cereals, make sure the granola has low sodium and sugar levels to ensure a healthy start to your day.
 Mid-morning Snack
Instead of a bagel and cream cheese, swap out the carbs and dairy for a healthier option that will fill you up. I love to take a salt-free rice cake and spread some organic peanut or almond butter on it with sliced bananas on top. This alternative satisfies the need for carbs with the crunch of the rice cake while providing a healthy protein with the almond or peanut butter.
 Lunch
Instead of having a bowl of pasta for your meal, swap out the carbs for zucchini noodles. “Zoodles” are a delicious alternative to pasta and a great way to add some vegetables to your diet while cutting back on the carbs. Top them with a marinara sauce and some extra veggies for added flavor.
 Afternoon snack
Instead of potato chips or popcorn, have a bowl of fresh fruit and some unsalted trail mix to help you get through the rest of your day!
 Dinner
Instead of a burrito, make a salad with the ingredients from inside the burrito, which gets rid of the carbs from the tortilla and adds some greens to your meal! Salads are a great option for dinner if you load them with proteins. As a side, go for some fresh vegetables and a healthier carb such as quinoa.
Dessert
If you need a little something to satisfy your sweet tooth, have some dark chocolate. This is one of the best kinds of desserts for you because dark chocolate is proven to help maintain a healthy heart and is a good source of antioxidants.
I hope this menu takes you through your day. Just remember, you CAN enjoy substituting your common cravings for healthy alternatives.

Photo from The Rooftop Guide
As L.A. natives know, Sunday brunch should offer not only good food but a unique atmosphere to sip lattes or mimosas, catch up with friends and forget about our busy lives. Perch, the popular rooftop eatery, allows you to be a spectator of the L.A. skyline while enjoying your food in a charming historic building.
Perch is located on Hill Street in Downtown near Pershing Square. The entrance to the restaurant is street level. As soon as you step off the street and into the building, you are thrown back in time. Dark wood paneling and period Charlie Chaplin posters line the hallway, where you call the vintage elevator (and pray it can make it to the top). Then, you are guided up to the roof. This sets the scene for the oasis of a restaurant above the city.

Perch features seating indoors at tables, the bar or couches. Or you can walk onto the patio area and sit outside. It’s often extremely busy, so if you have the forethought, it is recommended that you make a reservation. However, when I went we didn’t have a reservation and we were able to find a seat at the bar.
I ordered the Eggs Benedict, and the others with me tried the Three Egg Omelette and Two Eggs Any Style, which they got fried. Everything was done well, definitely qualifying as a classy and quality meal. Eggs Benedict can be a tricky dish, but I think they nailed the sauce. The bacon was thick and smoky with the fried eggs. Additionally, it’s hard hard to find great breakfast potatoes, but we all agreed these were flavorful and we all could have eaten twice as many!

The restaurant was established by Den Haan and Rachel Thomas, entrepreneurs who previously had founded the restaurant Must in Downtown on 5th Street. When they had to close Must, they decided that their next venture would be Perch, the rooftop experience for French cuisine.
Although brunch is a popular meal at Perch, so are dinner and cocktails. Sometimes, the restaurant has live music as well, with groups scheduled throughout the week. The schedule can be found on their website under the calendar tab.
So next time you need a break from campus, I suggest making reservations here with friends, especially for the iconic rooftop experience and photo-ready food. This would also be a great place to go with parents or relatives. You’ll come away refreshed and ready to start the week after a little brunch escape!

It’s mid-afternoon on a Friday in the courtyard of the Troy East apartment complex — a block away from the USC campus — and Jack Jablonski is standing up.
He’s in the middle of a rehabilitation session and is strapped into equipment at his chest, waist and ankles, his arms resting on a tray protruding from a chest plate.
Getting to this point takes a lot of effort for Jablonski and his two trainers, Alicia Villarreal and Brent Brayshaw. They’ve moved him from his wheelchair to a massage table and stretched every part of his body from his shoulders to his Achilles vigorously for half an hour. Always sitting in a wheelchair means Jablonski’s muscles are tense.

They do this three times a week, two hours each session. Each day is a different focus, which can include standing, stretching, biking and core workouts. Today is Friday, so they stretch him, and they stretch him well.
“Today is ‘make everything hurt’ day,” Jablonski says, laying on the table while Brayshaw stretches his shoulders and Villarreal works on his knees, trying to stimulate blood flow. Vigorous is no hyperbole.
“Ready? One, two, three,” Brayshaw says as he moves Jablonski onto a seat on the equipment. He repeats it twice more, carefully shuffling the 6-foot-2-inch former hockey player’s body.
Finally, Jablonski’s there, standing on his own two feet. Still, he has to wait while they take his heart rate and blood pressure. If either is too high and he begins to feel lightheaded, he has to sit back down.
Today, everything’s fine, and Jablonski’s in his usual good mood.
“It feels nice to be taller than everybody,” Jablonski says. “I am 6-foot-2.”
***
Once upon a time, Jablonski was flying around hockey rinks.

Growing up in Minnesota, Jablonski did what most kids did and learned how to skate at a young age. His dad, Mike, taught him when he was three, and then he picked up sports. He played baseball, tennis and golf — but nothing could beat hockey, the “bread-and-butter” sport of the state.
And he was good at it too, at the top of his class. He had a 50-goal season the year before high school for his Bantam-A team — an under-15 league — in a state that routinely produces the best young hockey players in the country. He dreamed of playing in the NHL and was on course to play for a Division I team in college.
“I had a passion for scoring goals,” Jablonski said. “And I was very good at it when I played.”
When he played. The use of past tense is striking and disheartening, a realization that the game he loved was tragically ripped away from him.
The date was Dec. 30, 2011. Jablonski was a sophomore in high school at Benilde-St. Margaret’s in St. Louis Park, Minn., playing in the championship game of a holiday tournament against rival Wayzata High School. His parents were in the stands.
The game was tied 2-2 with 14 minutes left in regulation. Jablonski had already scored a goal, and now it was getting intense.
“We were playing our rivals,” Jablonski said. “There was a lot on the line.”
Stepping out onto the ice, Jablonski took the puck in his defensive zone and skated up ice on a two-on-two. He moved past a defender and tried to head to the net but was cut off. So Jablonski turned away toward the boards, looking to pass. As he did, the player he just passed hit him in his right shoulder. Simultaneously, another defender who Jablonski didn’t see jammed his elbow into Jablonski’s neck, sending Jablonski face-first into the boards.
As Jablonski laid on the ice, his mom, Leslie, waited for him to get up. She hated seeing her son crash into the boards, but he always stood back up.

“You start counting,” she said. “Get up; get up.”
But this time would be different. The arena fell silent. Panic settled in on everyone’s faces. Leslie was in shock. While Mike went to check on their son, she stayed behind, afraid of what she would find out. Finally, she went to him, and she heard the words that devastated her.
“He looked at me and said, ‘Mom, I can’t feel my legs,’” she said. “I almost keeled over on top of him.”
She remembers the desperation of the hours that followed: the trip to the hospital as she hung on to her son on a gurney, hearing that he might be paralyzed, that he might be a quadriplegic.
And she remembers when reality set in a couple of days later, standing next to her son’s bed at 2 a.m. as he turned to her.
“I’m paralyzed, aren’t I?” he asked his mom.
The question crushed her, as did her answer.
“Yes, Jack,” she said. “You are.”
The injury — a “complete injury” to Jablonski’s C5 and C6 vertebrae — severed everything in his neck vital for mobility and motion. All feeling below the level of injury was lost.
“You’ll be lucky to bend your right arm,” doctors told Jablonski. “Your left arm’s not going to move, really.”
“We told you that,” they added. “Prove us wrong.”
***
Within a week, Jablonski had already done it, able to attempt to slap his brother, Max. But there was so much more to that week, to the initial days that Jablonski laid in the hospital bed, his life forever altered.

In Minnesota and across the country, his story blew up. He was all over the news, on the front page of Yahoo. A nonstop stream of family and friends stopped by to see him. Players from the Minnesota Wild — his hometown team — visited, as did other NHL teams when they stopped by to play against the Wild. His story even reached the upper echelon of hockey legends. Wayne Gretzky called. So did Bobby Orr. Jeremy Roenick changed his plans to fly to Minnesota.
The hockey community is very tightly knit, where everyone knows each other. And they united around the Jablonskis almost immediately, helping to fundraise to renovate the family’s house and purchase a van to accommodate Jablonski’s condition.
“A lot of hockey parents realized it could’ve been their child,” Leslie said. “Everyone just rallied around us.”
In turn, Jablonski remained upbeat. Strapped in a halo — a metal ring fixated around his head — he greeted every visitor with a smile, still making sure they were comfortable. He worried about how the guy who delivered the hit was feeling even though he was the one who was paralyzed (the player did visit Jablonski and received his forgiveness).
And as devastated as Leslie may have felt, she had no choice but to embrace her son’s attitude.
“To see your child laying in a hospital bed with a halo around head — he could’ve been so mad, but he wasn’t,” Leslie said. “The only thing we could do was join him and be positive. That became contagious. That’s why he is where he is today.”
The summer after his injury, Jablonski began setting goals for himself, for his recovery. His first one? Going back to high school as a junior. That summer, on top of four to five hours of intensive therapy a day for four to five days a week, Jablonski worked to catch up on all the classes he missed — and he did.
“That was a huge stepping stone, getting back to normality,” Jablonski said.

In 1981, former USC All-American swimmer Mike Nyeholt broke his neck in a motorcycle accident, leaving him a quadriplegic. That inspired Nyeholt’s former college roommate, Ron Orr, to start Swim With Mike, a scholarship program for physically challenged athletes. To date, the program, which pays full tuition, has raised more than $18 million and granted nearly 200 scholarships to students at 97 different universities.
And Swim With Mike found Jablonski, who learned about the scholarship when the Anaheim Ducks visited him in the hospital. From there, Orr met with Jablonski and his father and was sold by Jablonski’s character.
“Jack exemplifies what the scholarship was set up for,” Orr said. “The way he’s accepted his situation and lived with it and owned it. He’s mature beyond his age.”
Today, Jablonski is a sophomore at USC, majoring in communication and minoring in sports media studies. He is one of 12 Swim With Mike scholars at the University.
He chose USC after visiting his senior year of high school and falling in love with it. He loved the warm climate — Jablonski’s body can’t regulate body temperature, so his muscles would tighten up in the cold Minnesota winter. He loved the strong academics USC offered and the chance to live in the media capital of the world as a communication major.
And he’s taking advantage of these aspects. It’s been more than five years since the injury, and despite the crippling diagnosis, Jablonski is living college life to the fullest.
He goes to class like everyone else, getting around on a motorized wheelchair on his own. He can use his pinky finger to send texts, his hands to high-five or shake hands.
Still, there are limits the injury places on him: the mundane actions that can turn into challenges, whether it is opening doors, eating on his own, getting dressed or getting ready for bed.
“Spasms can kick my shoe off, or my foot can fall and I can’t always kick it up and put it up on my footrest,” Jablonski said. “My pants need adjusting or my shirt does. Whatever it is — daily, day-to-day living. Ninety-five percent of what the normal human does, I can’t do.”

Which is why Jablonski is grateful for the support system he has. A caretaker lives with him 24/7, catering to his needs. His second semester, Jablonski pledged the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, linking him with 130 brothers to form a friend group and help him get through his days.
“If it wasn’t for TKE, I don’t know where I’d be,” he said. “I don’t know if I’d still be here just because of the friend group that I’ve developed.”
But Jablonski’s routine goes beyond his class and his fraternity. He just wrapped up his second season interning for the Los Angeles Kings — last year as a public relations intern and this year working for their communications team by hosting a postgame podcast. He is credentialed for every home game, watching from the press box.
“Never once did I want to leave the game after I was injured,” Jablonski said. “It just made me want to be with it more.”

He also dedicates time to his foundation, the Jack Jablonski Bel13ve in Miracles Foundation (13 was his jersey number), a charity set up to support spinal cord injury recovery. Launched on the one-year anniversary of his injury, the foundation partners with the Mayo Clinic, one of the most reputable hospitals in the country. Last November, at a fundraising event during a Wild game, the foundation raised more than $350,000.
The money is being spent on research and studies by the Mayo Clinic that Jablonski hopes will one day cure spinal cord injuries. One possibility is what is called “epidural stimulation,” which Jablonski said is yielding results.
He is on a mission to see this through, much to his mom’s appreciation.
“Here he is, a college student, trying to stay in the game of hockey, going to school and class halfway across the country and still trying to stay involved to raise studies,” Leslie said. “It’s mind-boggling.”
If life were fair, Jack Jablonski would be playing hockey for a Division I program right now. If bad things didn’t happen to good people, Jablonski would still be flying around hockey rinks, scoring goals and celebrating with his teammates.
That’s the thing, though. Sometimes, your story is altered for some unknown reason, and how you write the rest is up to you.
For Leslie, not a day goes by that she wishes this had never happened to her son.
“You always wonder what life would be like otherwise,” she said.
But Jablonski has embraced what life has given him, and he’s not just putting on an act. He is honest about the journey he has taken and willing to discuss his traumatic injury to the point where he’s made jokes about it, according to Amy MacRae, a close friend.
“He’s very straightforward,” said MacRae, a sophomore majoring in journalism. “He knows his situation, and he doesn’t try to sugarcoat it.”
MacRae thinks Jablonski’s openness is one of his best attributes, allowing others in similar situations to look to connect with him and gain inspiration from him.
“He knows it’s horrible, but his life is still going to go on,” MacRae said. “His life’s not over. He’s still alive.”

Oh, he’s alive alright — more than just alive — and anyone who spends enough time with him can see the evidence. You see it in his determination, in his everglowing positivity that began from day one of the injury and is still emanating, bright as ever. You see it in his desire to remain invested in the game of hockey, in his foundation where he is using the fame and media attention to help not just himself, but also everyone affected by spinal cord injury. And you see it during his thrice-a-week rehab sessions, in the effort he puts in just to stand up and move his arms.
His arms have gotten stronger, his trainers say. And every time Leslie sees him, he looks “stronger and stronger.” Jablonski doesn’t doubt that he will walk again, but he knows the chances are slim. And yet, here he is, still fighting, still living, still dreaming. The blindside hit in a holiday tournament hockey game may have taken away Jablonski’s mobility, but it’s brought out the best in him.
“If there’s a good side to a tragedy,” Leslie said, “we’ve seen it.”
