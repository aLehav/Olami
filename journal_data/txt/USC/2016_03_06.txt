My third week in Istanbul, I met a Boğaziçi student who had just returned from studying at a Russian university for two years, where he had planned to finish his degree. Prior to that, he had been pursuing a philosophy degree at Boğaziçi when he decided that the subject wasn’t really for him. But after he had to leave Russia as relations soured between Russia and Turkey (a subject that really merits its own series of posts), he came back to Istanbul and had just started at an entirely new institution, meaning he would graduate in four years after four years of schooling already.
By no means is this a course I would recommend or commend, but anyone who attempted to follow the same path in America would likely be in six-figure debt, at least, unless they were extremely wealthy. People are already in six-figure debt trying to finish one degree in three or four years, for God’s sake. But alas, things are different in Europe, where public universities are generally tuition-free, and private universities charge fees at rates that are ridiculously low compared to the States.
For example, at Boğaziçi, a public university and one of Turkey’s best (slight digression: a Turkish student told me some parents come to bury their child’s umbilical cord in the trees surrounding Boğaziçi in hopes their child will gain admission), tuition is free for four years. After that, students must pay a nominal fee, the equivalent of about $350, to finish their degree. This is ridiculously low in the United States, and not expensive either for middle class Turks.
“I probably won’t finish in four years,” a Turkish student told me. “But I feel bad making my parents pay when I could have done it for free.”
Yup, you read it here folks: she feels bad for $350. Try to avoid comparing that to your tuition rates. And Turkey is not at all a democratic socialist state like the vaunted Nordic countries we keep hearing about. Neither is Australia, where college costs are also several times lower, and the Australian students I’ve spoken to, like others from across the world, react with varying degrees of shock and disbelief at how much we pay. A French girl told me that because her university was private, it was very expensive. Her answer when I asked how much: about $10,000. One of my friends studying abroad in London told me she was shocked when she sat in a session with some British students who were giving very blunt critiques of a professor they felt was not up to par. Their response when she told them she was surprised? “We pay £9,000 (~$12,700) [per year] to attend, so we deserve to have our concerns addressed.” 
Pretty simple I guess – you pay for a service and you want to get the most out of it.
Now, I’m not arguing that university educations should be subsidized to the point where there is little incentive to actually graduate. But it seems pretty damn fair to demand a system where students will be able to actually pay for the costs of their education, perhaps while working part-time, or by taking out small, low-interest loans (comparable to current interest rates if not lower for students) that they can realistically start paying back incrementally with entry-level salaries that they will probably get upon graduation. Older adults accuse millennials all the time of being lazy, whiny, etc. — but times have changed, and some stubbornly refuse to accept that. It cannot be financially impossible for the America to address its higher education costs or reform education laws when its economic output is several times that of countries who are already doing the same.
And in fact, there was a time in the United States. when students could put themselves through school by working. My own father, who arrived in America in 1978 on a student visa, was able to put himself through six years of school (learning English and transferring from community college) with minimal family support by working jobs that included a stint at a gas station in Barstow and a country club in Arizona. He tells me he actually finished college with savings, and in the last few years of school, he refused the money his parents would try to send him. Imagine that: affordable college education, promoting growth and social mobility, in capitalist America. Maybe I’m hopelessly naive, but it can’t be impossible to put policies in place that would allow current and future students to have this option available to them as well.
At Boğaziçi, students are active in all areas of campus life. A few years ago, students staged a sit-in at the Starbucks on campus because they didn’t want expensive products being sold on campus (tea and coffee from other shops is much cheaper). The space was later converted to a quiet study hall. This week, students are boycotting the dining halls in support of the dining hall workers.
I can’t help but compare this level of student action to issues at USC, where the student body, for various reasons, often doesn’t engage in the way that our peers at other American or international institutions do. With attention in recent days to USC’s yearly tuition breaking $50,000 per year, and further thousand dollar increases scheduled in years to come, there are certainly some issues that need to addressed. And we need to put USC in a place to address them. Outrageous college expenses shouldn’t be part of American exceptionalism, but from I’m hearing from students across the world, it unfortunately seems to be.

In a marathon 14-inning affair, the No. 22 Trojans fell to No. 9 UCLA 5-3 to wrap up the annual Dodger Stadium Classic at Dodger Stadium on Sunday.
USC took a 2-run deficit into the bottom of the 14th frame. Southall and Nootbaar led things off with back-to-back singles to put the tying run on first with none out, but the Trojans could not complete the rally.
Senior Brent Wheatley toed the rubber for Sunday’s game against the Bruins, as the Trojans took on their crosstown rivals in a non-conference game. USC raced out to an early lead thanks to senior A.J. Ramirez’s 2-run triple in the bottom of the first. A double steal set up freshman outfielder Lars Nootbaar to lay down a safety squeeze, scoring junior second baseman Frankie Rios and extending the lead to 3-0.
UCLA responded with a run in the top of the third and then 2 more in the top of the fourth to tie things up. Redshirt junior Joe Navilhon entered in relief of Wheatley to start the fifth and continued a weekend of sharp performances out of the USC bullpen. The right-hander tossed three scoreless frames to keep the deadlock in place. Senior Brooks Kriske picked up where Navilhon left off, tossing up two goose eggs before the game went into extra innings.
Junior Jeff Paschke entered the game in the 10th, retiring the side in order, but ran into trouble in the top of the 11th. He managed to escape with the score still tied with the go-ahead run stranded at third base. Senior closer Marc Huberman pitched the twelfth, also getting out of the inning with the go-ahead run 90 feet from home.
Huberman worked a scoreless 13th but he couldn’t work out of a bases-loaded jam in the top of the 14th, allowing a weak single up the middle to UCLA’s Cristoph Bono to plate the go-ahead run and an error by redshirt junior shortstop Reggie Southall brought another run home to give the Bruins a 5-3 lead.
“It was an unbelievable college baseball game,” head coach Dan Hubbs said after the loss. “I think people got their money’s worth.”
Hubbs, however, was disappointed that the Trojans did not execute when they had their opportunities.
“We had the tying run in scoring position,” he said, referring to the bottom of the 14th inning. “Someone has to get a hit there.”
Next up for the Trojans is a challenging trip to Fort Worth, Texas to take on TCU. The Horned Frogs visited Los Angeles for the Dodger Stadium Classic in 2015, falling to USC, 7-6, in a 12-inning thriller at Dedeaux Field.

I haven’t had a crush on anyone in like, centuries. But there’s this one guy at work that I’m stupid hung up on. We don’t work the same shift, I’ve only run into him a few times, and we barely know each other. How can I find an excuse to talk to him? We aren’t even friends on Facebook! 
You don’t need an excuse to talk to him! Take him down from this pedestal he doesn’t yet deserve to be on. I know it’s hard, but imagine how you would behave if you were not infatuated with him. If he were just some guy you wanted to befriend, you’d probably add him on Facebook and not think anything of it. You might even casually bring up getting coffee or having a study sesh together sometime. Worst case scenario, he doesn’t accept your friend request or deflects your suggestion to hang out. Act like it’s no biggie, and either way he responds you just come off like a friendly, confident, cool-as-a-cucumber person. Win-win, baby.
If you think I’m setting you up to come on too strong, just know that it’s easy to become hypersensitive to the nuances of every interaction in situations like these. Science has shown that in 99 percent of cases involving one-sided adoration, the other person is not reading into everything as much as you are. (Statistical analysis from personal experience.) And also, know that this type of casual idolatry is dangerous. All I’m saying is, he might seem great from afar, but after you hang out you could unearth some real deal breakers. He might be insufferably vapid. His favorite musical artist might be a really     sh-tty DJ. He might even support the tyrannical rise of Donald Trump (in which case, he should be written off immediately).

It’s no secret that diversity has been a pressing issue lately. With the Oscars nominating strictly white performers for the second year in a row making headlines, the pursuit of equal representation in media is beginning to become more and more of a priority. The fashion realm, especially, has faced criticism for being notoriously exclusive when it comes to representation. Inch by inch, the industry has made improvements in diversification: More diverse models are landing campaigns, and designers are embracing gender fluidity by hiring models who identify as transgender or androgynous. A more diverse fashion industry means representing people of all shapes and sizes, which is where the term “plus size” comes into play. Supermodels like Ashley Graham and Tess Holliday are changing the discussion by redefining what the media portrays as beautiful. Graham, who was the first ever plus-size model to land the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, strongly advocates for diversity in media and argues that the current profile of models who work in fashion don’t accurately reflect the average woman. She, along with other women of the same mindset, are pushing for inclusion so that fashion can serve as more of a global unifier. 
Change is slow, but it’s happening. However, there is an elephant in the room that has yet to be addressed seriously: Why isn’t the same change happening in men’s fashion?
It’s true that the female fashion industry is more expansive; almost all the shows at New York Fashion Week are dedicated to women’s collections, and we almost always associate the term “supermodel” to a female name. The female industry, in an effort to become more inclusive, has offered a wider range of sizes to women for years. This isn’t the case for men for a number of reasons. For one, due to market size, there isn’t enough money behind the industry for it to be able to support more sizes. In addition, men’s high fashion has maintained a much stronger rigidity in requiring a lean body due to a double standard that holds men to the idea of masculinity and athleticism.  Women of size, in contrast, are associated with curviness, a quality that is often pegged as “unattractive” when found in the opposite gender.
Regardless of market size and stereotype, the fact of the matter is that men’s fashion isn’t making the same progress as its female counterpart. According to journalist Mark Simpson, one of the main reasons for a lack of representation in male fashion is that there are no politics behind it.
“Men are objectified all the time in the media, but it’s not called ‘objectification.’” Simpson said. “There’s no male equivalent of feminist ideology.”
The Huffington Post also had the opportunity to interview Zach Miko, who made headlines last year after becoming Target’s first plus size male model. Miko argues that men suffer from insecurity just as women do, but the double standard in which they are raised teach them to hide it. Men are conditioned to suppress their feelings and consequently are at risk to develop serious self esteem issues. The effects of muscle dysphoria, an eating disorder that causes men to think that they are too small and work out excessively, are comparable to the effects of anorexia on the body and mind. During a time where diversity is in demand, it just might be in the industry’s best interest to consider change, as the self esteem and mental health of younger generations depend on it.
Why do you think there’s no such thing as a male plus size model? Let’s have a discussion about it in the comments. 
big and tall men aka plus size men is lacking support from the media & fashion world
When it comes to the discussion of gender anything, the only valid view point has been from the same cohort that has been demonizing and demonstrated a truly negative disposition towards men and boys. Just maybe, people are waking up to this, but it will likely be a discussion that will have to take place some 50 years from now. Why? Simple, the strangle hold of the ideology on the discussion has proved to be a life long view point. My evidence is the recent comments “There is a special place in hell” for any who question the orthodoxy.

Department of Public Safety Deputy Chief David Carlisle said that the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating an incident of racism that occurred Sunday at Cardinal Gardens.
Ivan Tsang, a sophomore majoring in business administration who is originally from Hong Kong, posted on Facebook following the incident. Tsang said that while he was sitting outside a fireplace at Cardinal Gardens early Sunday morning, a student shouted racial slurs and threw eggs at him from the balcony of an apartment in the building. 
“Early Sunday morning a member of our USC community reported an incident of discrimination and prejudice that was threatening and unconscionable,” Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said in a statement sent to students Sunday night. “An undergraduate student notified us that while sitting outside his campus residence he had eggs thrown at him accompanied by racial slurs. This act was shameful and will not be tolerated at our university.”
Tsang said that he attempted to ignore the three eggs pelted at him over a twenty minute period, but after the second egg was thrown, he called DPS.
“At first, I was just going let it go, but then they came back and threw a second egg at me. And this was clearly aimed at me,” Tsang said. 
As the student entered the balcony for a second time, he or she aimed eggs at Tsang, explicitly shouting racially targeted expletives.
“[He or she said] the ‘ching chong’ is still there,” Tsang said. 
Tsang said this is not the first time he has experienced racism and that he has heard many slurs while walking on South Figueroa. However, the incident — which has gained attention on social media — was the first time he experienced such blatant racist at University housing, “a well-protected USC space,” according to Tsang. 
“I was sitting there because I was truly comfortable. I had no fears,” Tsang said. 
He claims it was not the three eggs that bothered him, but the racial slurs that followed.
As a response to the incident, a resident assistant sent an email to students living at Cardinal Gardens.
“We do not tolerate this kind of behavior here in Cardinal Gardens at all, and our residential supervisors here in the community are currently taking care of the situation … Car Gar is meant to be a safe and inclusive community for EVERYONE,” the email said. 
This incident comes at a time where campus climate is a major point of discussion.
While responding to such incidents, Tsang advised students to avoid directly challenging attackers to ensure student safety. However, he highlighted the accessible university resources for students experiencing similar racism. 
“There are many available resources on campus you can access to make complaints, and you can have it anonymous too, which is great,” Tsang said.
UPDATE:
According to the Los Angeles Times, the suspect sent a message to Tsang apologizing for his behavior. LAPD Detective R. Saafir said the suspect noted in his apology that he was also Asian and was intoxicated, according to the Times.
UPDATE:
The LAPD has concluded that the incident should not be treated as a hate crime, according to a statement from Carry on March 10. The incident will be handled by the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards. In the statement, Carry said that the University would be unable to provide further details of the proceedings as disciplinary records are protected under federal law and because student’s have a right to confidentiality .
“Thank you for understanding our obligation to comply with federal law and protect student privacy,” Carry said.

Spam Fried Rice…
Potential for LMAO. CBS is reporting that the perpetrator attempted to reach out to the victim claiming that he is Asian, had too much to drink, and is sorry. What a POS.
So, one guy allegedly threw three eggs near another guy but didn’t hit him (over the course of half an hour or so?) and talked ugly. Let’s get the FBI in on this brutal crime! Let’s get it into national newspapers!
Black kids are always throwing rocks at me when I ride my bike, but I’ve never even called the cops.
Kudos. That was a brilliant post. Your intelligence and logic are to be commended not to mention your tolerance for potential bodily harm.
If what you say is true why not?
By the way, he said that “she” threw eggs.
Did you ever consider your choices aren’t the best to follow? 
Thanks for sharing what people should not do when experiencing discrimination.
Wonder why they did not mention the race of the perpetrators ? 
Well the article didn’t even know the gender of the egg tosser.
NM
So you’re just as racist, congratulations.
The Truth you’re right. That’s all I gotta say.

In his annual State of the University address on Feb. 11, President C. L. Max Nikias placed heavy emphasis on increasing diversity throughout the USC community. His speech paralleled many of the student efforts that have been made to ameliorate recent problems with inclusion, including the Undergraduate Student Government’s Campus Climate Resolution, which was passed in the fall.
The original resolution outlined multiple actions to be taken on the administration’s part. According to USG President Rini Sampath, after the passing of the resolution, Provost Michael Quick established a task force, which consists of Ainsley Carry, vice president for Student Affairs; Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life;  Nikita Hamilton, Graduate Student Government president; Christina Gutierrez, GSG vice president; Sampath; Moira Turner, director of diversity affairs; Ginger Clark, president of the Academic Senate; Debra Langford, officer of diversity and inclusion initiatives in the Marshall School of Business; Domenika Lynch, executive director of the Latino Alumni Association; and Jodi Armour, professor at the Gould School of Law.
However, Sampath also said the administration has yet to address several objectives of the resolution, including the hiring of additional Title IX coordinators and the establishment of a Vice President of Diversity. For this reason, Sampath said, there has been growing frustration among the student body.
“We haven’t seen immediate action,” Sampath said. “Where the students, I think, are disappointed is that this is turning into more conversations, more dialogue, and it’s a cyclical advocacy process. Students are feeling [a lack] of trust in the process.”
She added that students feel that there seems to be a discrepancy between the resolution and the actions taken by administrators. Graduate student Leslie Berntsen, who is one of the student organizers with the Campus Climate Coalition, echoed feelings of this discrepancy.
“[Nikias] gave his State of the University and it addressed the wicked problems of diversity, equity and inclusion, and there was a great press release and it looked very good,” Berntsen said. “But that image is entirely at odds with the students’ opinions of who actually gets to talk to [him and other administrators].”
Berntsen recalled one instance in which she saw an administrator walk past a student who was trying to ask whether he was going to be at a task force meeting, only to be completely disregarded.
“The body language was so striking,” Bernsten said. “It was ‘I do not want to be here or talk to you about any of this.’ So I think there’s a disconnect between the material in speeches that are given and what’s actually happening on the ground as we’re organizing around these issues.”
Berntsen said she sees Nikias’ speech as more of a “symbolic gesture” than anything else.
“I appreciate the efforts,” Berntsen said. “I can’t emphasize that enough. But there’s still much work to be done.”
Efforts in addition to the task force have included a secondary advisory board as well as open forums for students, according to Sampath. In addition, she said that the task force is pushing for transparency by publishing meeting summaries to a new website, diversity.usc.edu. In addition, Quick, to substitute for the VP of Diversity, has created a diversity liaison model, which will consist of faculty members and staff.
“The student community is absolutely still pushing for this VP of Diversity spot,” Sampath said. “Especially because we see issues [such as] a student [telling] me they experienced an awful incident of racism and had no idea who to go to.”
However, whatever the discrepancies may be, Sampath is pleased that there is an open discussion between the administration and the student body.
“I think one of the biggest successes for us is to have opened this up as a conversation, and to have sustained that conversation,” Sampath said. “I think students [are] able to keep the momentum going. For example, our Campus Climate Coalition is now hosting general body meetings and the administration is hosting these task force meetings and open forums, so I’m really grateful.”

The Student Alliance for Nationalism and Democracy, an anti-genocide coalition, hosted its first annual Human Rights Conference on Saturday, which included participants from USC and other regional universities. The conference aimed to address issues of human rights in developing countries and promote humanitarian goals across the world to help end genocide.
The conference included speeches, workshops, presentations on activism and a documentary screening and was funded by USG and the Jewish World Watch.
“We have been working on this for a while now,” Darcy Gleeson, a STAND activist and writer for the Daily Trojan, said. “I hope that today everyone leaves with a greater understanding of [world] conflicts and how they are directly a part of [these conflicts]. We are a part of a chain that has a big effect on people.”
There were two workshops by the Jewish World Watch and iEmpathize. The JWW workshop was conducted by Mike Brand, director of policy and programs at JWW, and Noa Oldak-Moradian, a program associate at JWW. They deliberated on strategies of effectively engaging Congress to fight genocide and discussed the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brand and Oldak-Moradian also brought up the Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act and other methods used to connect citizens with government agencies working on such issues.
JWW also made an appeal to the students to support their cause by tweeting to the state senators to sponsor their initiative.
Guido Hajenius, iEmpathize’s Southern California Office Engagement Coordinator, discussed how social media can be used as a platform for activism to evoke empathy and empower people to eradicate child exploitation. Hajenius observed that throughout the world, the millions of cases of sexual violence against children and that juvenile exploitation is not only criminal but has cultural implications as well.
“If we are not going to engage other people in this initiative, we are not going to solve this problem,” Hajenius said. “The key thing about empathy is that when you are relating to the suffering of others, you are identifying them to be your equal level, which means everything.”
The conference also featured a workshop about student activism by former STAND President Francesca Bessey.
The event ended with the screening of the documentary film When Elephants Fight. The film focuses on the controversy over mineral-rich soil in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the civil war that has brought poverty, war and corruption to the Congolese while corporations, nations and armed groups have made billions sustaining today’s technology. A noted social activist and filmmaker, Michael Ramsdell, was present to discuss the documentary afterward.
Manaswini Tummala, a senior majoring in international relations and economics, said that the conference was effective in not just raising awareness for activism, but also as a potential networking event for people who are considering a career in the field.
“Such conferences show you that there are alternate career paths that you can take after college, working for the society and non-profits,” Tummala said. “More importantly, they show you how to connect with a lot of people within your workspace and still make a difference.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misquoted Mike Brand as saying “The development on campus is a really great example of grad students and GAPA coming together to work on such important issues. The modern workers are working hard to get this bill introduced in the Senate.” The quote has been removed. The students are working together on important issues and GAPA is an example of grass-roots advocacy. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The USC Value Investing Group, an undergraduate business finance organization, hosted a two-day investment conference this weekend with students from across the country.
The USC Stock Pitch Competition is the first of its kind to be hosted on the West Coast. The purpose of the competition is to offer a platform for students to showcase their talents in value investing and to network with like-minded individuals and industry professionals. Senior members from the Value Investing Group have participated in similar competitions before at universities like Harvard, University of Michigan and Georgetown but realized that no such competition existed on the West Coast, because the finance industry is centered in New York.
Recently, West Coast universities have been sending more students to the finance industry, so the Value Investing Group organized this competition in order to give more West Coast students the chance to participate in this type of event and put USC on the map of finance recruiters.
The conference was the final round of a stock pitch competition that began in early February. To participate, approximately 25 teams submitted two page investment theses summarizing a risk profile, industry analysis and a valuation of a company of their choosing with a market capitalization of at least 100 million dollars. The event sponsors then selected the top 13 investment ideas to continue on in the competition.
The event kicked off on Friday night with a keynote address from Arthur Lev, the chairman of Morgan Stanley’s investment management division and a current senior advisor to the firm. Following the introductions, students had the opportunity to network with industry professionals from many companies including Morgan Stanley, Capello Global and Solstein Capital. In the first round on Saturday, 13 teams from New York University, USC, University of Texas at Austin, University of Michigan, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and Washington University in St. Louis presented to panels of judges, recent alumni of USC working in the finance industry. The top three teams were then chosen to present before the three final round judges — Lev, Alexander Capello, the CEO of Cappello Group Inc., and Felix Bernshteyn, a portfolio manager at Solstein Capital.
“The main value of this competition is the access these students get to highly influential industry leaders and recent alumni,” Daniel Clancy, president of USC Value Investing Group, said. “The purpose of the club is to try educate younger students about industry analysis, picking stocks, corporate finance and company valuation. The Stock Pitch Competition gives students from across the country the chance to apply these skills.”
The winning team was from UT Austin and was awarded $1,000 for their efforts. The members — Phoebe Lin, Vishal Bhat, Arjo Mozumder and Karna Venkatraj — chose Electronics for Imaging, a digital printing firm, as their company of choice.
“The preparation process for the competition involved several all-nighters and a lot of work,” Bhat said. “It was worth it, though. I have participated in a national stock pitch competition before, but I really enjoyed the diversity and level of experience of everyone on the career panel here.”
The professionals chosen to judge and mentor the students had similarly laudatory comments for the students.
“All of the presentations were thoughtful and incredibly impressive,” Lev said. “I have listened to many pitches before, and these students were on par with professionals in the industry.”

USC Special Collections has established a new initiative to compile the experiences of the Taiwanese-American community in the form of the Taiwanese-American Digital Archive, which aims to spotlight the Taiwanese-American community’s often-overlooked history.
The project was launched by Joanna Chen Cham, L.A. as Subject Resident Archivist with USC Libraries, with guidance from USC East Asian Library head Kenneth Klein. The initiative was formally announced on Feb. 9 at the Taiwanese-American Digital Archive Forum and Exhibit in Doheny Memorial Library. Cham and Klein are currently in the process of working with the community to collect materials that they plan to later digitize and make widely available.
Cham was inspired to create the initiative because of her background as a second-generation Taiwanese-American born in L.A. and the lack of Asian-American representation among archivists.
“I’ve always had an interest in seeing more diversity represented in both the profession, but also in the collections and the history that we collect,” Cham said. “And specifically, I think growing up in the Taiwanese community in the San Gabriel Valley … there wasn’t very much of that history being captured.”
Cham also emphasized the need for the archive to be established now, before the Taiwanese-American community’s rich history is lost.
“I think the timing is critical now because the first generations of Taiwanese-Americans started trickling in in the late ’60s, and then into the ’60s and the ’70s,” Cham said. “A lot of those people are starting to move away, maybe downsizing, [and] some people have passed away, so I think it’s very critical and the perfect timing now, to be able to capture that history before it’s gone.”
Despite the fact that many archives have collected materials about Chinese-Americans, cataloging the experiences of immigrants throughout major historical events like the Gold Rush and the Chinese Exclusion Act, as well as more recent immigration, Klein said that the same amount of attention has not been paid to Taiwanese-Americans.
“Overlooked, for the most part, has been the Taiwanese-American community, perhaps because it’s somewhat smaller,” Klein said.
Klein went on to highlight the benefits of USC becoming one of the first universities to focus on actively collecting Taiwanese-American history.
“By identifying with a niche that hasn’t been filled, so far as we can tell — we haven’t found any other institution that really collects materials focused on Taiwanese-Americans,” Klein said. “By doing that, we can establish presence that we didn’t have before and can give us a collection advantage, something that makes our collection distinct.”
Cham sees USC as a logical choice to host the archive, given the commitment of USC Libraries Special Collections and Archives to documenting L.A.’s diverse history, as well as USC’s deep connections to the community.
“Los Angeles is one of the largest Taiwanese-American communities in the U.S. I think it makes sense for Taiwanese-American history to be archived and preserved and accessible at a place that’s close to them,” Cham said, saying that USC in particular “has many community ties because it has a very diverse demographic of students.”
Currently, Cham and Klein are working to digitize newspaper runs so that issues discussed can be made more well-known and easily available for research. One of the newspapers they are planning to archive is the Pacific Times, an L.A.-based Taiwanese newspaper.
“It will be great if we can have some key documents preserved in a university such as USC, so that when people want to do research on Taiwanese-Americans, they will have a very easy time finding all the collections,” said Lin Wenching, editor-in-chief of the Pacific Times. “It’s a good project for us to do, to work with the East Asian Library, so that we can preserve such a rich history of Taiwanese-Americans. So definitely, it’s a very important project for us.”

For a team on the verge of its first NCAA tournament appearance in five seasons, the Trojans don’t seem carried away at all.
In a resurgent season for the men’s basketball team, the Trojans won 20 games for the first time since 2009 and 16 games at home for the first time since 1961. It was a season that saw the Men of Troy crack the AP Top 25 rankings — not once, but twice — for the first time since DeMar DeRozan and Taj Gibson donned cardinal and gold. The Trojans also notched several signature wins over Wichita State, Arizona and two victories over archrival UCLA.
Yet, March Madness is the last thing on their minds.
“I’m not going to speculate on the NCAA tournament,” head coach Andy Enfield said after Saturday’s 76-66 loss to Oregon. “That’s out of our hands. We’ve had a great year.”
Prior to Saturday’s game, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi penciled in USC as an eighth seed in the NCAA tournament in the South region.
As many as seven teams from the Pac-12 could make the NCAA tournament, with the conference boasting four teams in the AP Top 25 and six teams with an RPI in the top 40.
“We have 11 [wins against top 100 teams], which is significant,” Enfield said. “Could we have 22-23 wins? Of course, but we could also have 14-15 wins.”
A win on Saturday would have given the Trojans their first winning conference record since the 2010-2011 season, but USC fell to a deeper and more talented Oregon team at home.
The Men of Troy overcame a 15-point deficit to take a brief lead in the second half, but succumbed to offensive boards, poor free throw shooting and lack of consistency on offense.
“To have 20 wins and be 16-2 at home, our players have accomplished a lot,” Enfield said. “They beat a very good [Oregon State] team on Wednesday. They played exceptional basketball. [Against Oregon], we took the lead and came back against a top-10 team in the country. I can’t be upset at all. I think our team has a lot of improvement that’s still in there.”
The most glaring improvement would be their play on the road, where the Trojans were just 3-7 during the season and dropped their last six away games.
“We’re not very good on the road,” Enfield said. “The next step for our team for our players coming back is how to win on the road and play better basketball on the road on both ends of the floor.”
The test begins in the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas. As the seventh seed, the Trojans will take on 10th-seeded UCLA Wednesday night in the first round. They should be confident, having beaten the Bruins by double-digits this season twice — at home and on the road.
Yet, after the game Saturday, players dodged question after question about their NCAA tournament chances, pledging to stay focused on the immediate task ahead.
“[A tournament berth] would be huge, but we’re not thinking about it,” junior forward Nikola Jovanovic said. “We just want to focus game-to-game, which is Wednesday in Vegas.”
Redshirt junior forward Katin Reinhardt echoed that sentiment.
“We’re just ready for Wednesday, that’s all we’re worried about,” Reinhardt said.

If I had been told entering the 2015-2016 basketball season that USC would win 20 games, go .500 in conference play and sweep UCLA, I would have been ecstatic. With the regular season in the books following the loss to Oregon, USC has accomplished all three of those things, putting together a resume that should allow them to go dancing.
Although the back half of conference play was somewhat disappointing as the Trojans faltered down the stretch, a comprehensive evaluation would indicate that the season on the whole was a resounding success.
After the dominating victory over UCLA at the Galen Center, it felt as if USC was on top of the world and that they would continue their strong play and vie for the Pac 12 title. So with these adjusted expectations, many would be frustrated by their 2-6 finish down the stretch. However, just by taking a step back and remembering how low expectations were entering the season, it’s abundantly clear that this USC team should be applauded for their efforts.
This is not a team without their flaws. The last few weeks of  Pac-12 play have demonstrated that the team needs better interior defense and more consistent rebounding. Additionally, it would help the Trojans to get physically stronger across the board. Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic has come a long way since his freshman year in terms of strength, but he could still improve if he stays for his senior campaign.
The dynamic freshmen duo of Chemezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright would also be wise to hit the weight room this offseason and bulk up a bit. Metu has gotten by on incredible leaping ability and surprisingly nimble ball skills, but to really become an impact forward, he needs to put on some more weight.
Boatwright showed immense promise from the outside and is a matchup nightmare, but he too struggles with rebounding. As a guard in a forward’s body, he just doesn’t look fluid underneath when attempting to box out other big men in the conference.
It’s no surprise then that the Trojans struggled against the top teams with good post play. Arizona, Stanford, Utah and Cal all boast formidable inside presence and USC needs an intense 3-point attack to counter their deficiencies inside. They weren’t able to achieve that in many of those games, one of the main factors in their losses.
Against Oregon, the Trojans just lost to a better team. Both times they played the Ducks they shot poorly, partially attributable to coach Dana Altman’s defensive scheme. The team isn’t quite at the top tier of the conference yet, but the Trojans are moving in that direction.
Even though they might not be as good as the Utes, Ducks, Bears or Wildcats this year, USC does deserve a spot in the NCAA tournament. That on its own is a tremendous feather in the cap of head coach Andy Enfield and the Trojans. They can solidify their status with a third win against UCLA in the opening round of the Pac-12 tournament — a second or third win would be even better.
The Trojans exceeded all expectations this year and their player development was chiefly responsible. Sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin and junior guards Julian Jacobs and Katin Reinhardt were all markedly improved from last year. The shooting across the board was better as was the scheme and in game decisions by Enfield. This is a program on the rise; they just need to sustain their positive momentum and progress.
The team has another great recruiting class on the way and will be further bolstered by the eligibility of Shaquaan Aaron, but to reach the pinnacle of the Pac-12 conference they need to get better inside. Their only forward-center recruit is Harrison Henderson, who is tall and lanky, but doesn’t quite have the physical makeup yet to compete inside.
Hopefully the team can hit the weight room hard this summer and come out improved, taking the next step in rebounding and interior defense to be commensurate with their shooting and passing improvement from this season. The Trojans’ pace-and-space offense doesn’t require lumbering and rugged big men, but some more size and strength without sacrificing athleticism would do wonders for the team.
For now, I am more than content with watching this team in the Pac-12 conference and hopefully in the NCAA tournament. It was truly an awesome season witnessing the birth of a winning program.

USC baseball played in the annual Dodger Stadium Classic this weekend, hosting two games at Dedeaux Field before concluding the tournament against rivals UCLA in a game at Dodger Stadium.
In Friday’s game, the Trojans faced Oklahoma, as senior pitcher Kyle Davis took the mound looking to kick off the weekend with a win. USC raced out to a 3-0 lead against the Sooners thanks to back-to-back singles from senior outfielder Timmy Robinson and senior first baseman AJ Ramirez in the first inning.
Davis was touched for 3 runs on seven hits across his six innings of work, and the Trojans’ ace finished his night with the score tied 3-3. USC rallied in the bottom of the sixth, however, as a pinch-hit sacrifice fly from freshman Dillon Paulson pushed across the go-ahead run. Freshman outfielder Lars Nootbaar then added some insurance with an RBI single to extend the lead to 2 runs. The Trojans then loaded the bases with no outs in the next inning but failed to score.
They were nearly made to regret their mistake in the top of the ninth, as senior closer Marc Huberman walked three consecutive Sooners to load the bases with one out, but sophomore Brad Wegman came into the game and put out the fire, inducing an around-the-horn double play to clinch a 5-4 USC victory.
Head coach Dan Hubbs praised his team’s spirit as the squad battled through a close game.
“[Oklahoma] came back, but I thought we stayed with our plan and what we were trying to do,” Hubbs said. “We took advantage of some things they gave us, put some guys on base, and got some big hits, and I was really proud of the guys for doing that.”
Junior left-hander Bernardo Flores started the next day’s contest against No. 20 Mississippi State and breezed through a one-two-three top of the first. He staked a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the frame after a Robinson double drove in senior outfielder David Oppenheim.
Flores ran into trouble in the top of the second, however, and departed with the bases loaded with one out after giving up 3 runs. Sophomore Mason Perryman entered the game in relief and induced a pop out and a fly out to retire the Bulldogs. He returned in the top of the third and sent down the side in order.
The Trojans charged ahead in the bottom of the frame thanks to an RBI single from Oppenheim and Robinson’s second home run of the season, a 3-run shot. Perryman struggled to begin the fourth inning, though, and coughed up 4 runs before junior left-hander Andrew Wright came in to stop the bleeding.
Junior catcher Jeremy Martinez, who drew a start at first base against Mississippi State, pulled the Trojans within 1 run with a solo shot in the bottom of the fifth, but the Bulldogs promptly re-extended their lead to 2, scoring on a groundout in the top of the sixth.
Wegman relieved Wright in the top of the seventh and once again came out dealing. The right-hander threw up three scoreless innings, giving the Men of Troy the chance to rally from a 2-run deficit in the bottom of the ninth.
Paulson and junior David Edson pinch hit for junior second baseman Frankie Rios and freshman catcher CJ Stubbs respectively, and the two came off the bench and worked walks to lead off the USC’s last licks at the plate. Junior Corey Dempster then pinch hit for Southall and bunted the runners into scoring position with Nootbaar coming up. A wild pitch brought the Trojans within one and put the tying run on third base. The comeback fell just short, however, as Mississippi State’s freshman left-hander Kale Breaux froze Nootbaar on a breaking ball and retired Oppenheim on a groundout to seal an 8-7 win for the Bulldogs.
Despite the tough loss, Hubbs was proud of his side for going toe-to-toe with a strong Mississippi State team.
“It’s all I can ask of [the players]: they gave us a chance to win,” Hubbs said. “It doesn’t always work out when you get in the spot, but I thought we were better in the spot [against Mississippi State] than we have been up until now.”
Robinson echoed his coach’s comments, adding that Saturday’s game felt like a regional final in the NCAA Tournament.
“It was back-and-forth … and eventually, somebody has to lose,” Robinson said. “Today, we just came up short, but we had the tying run on third, which is all you can ask for.”
Next up for the Trojans is a challenging trip to Fort Worth, Texas, to take on TCU. The Horned Frogs visited Los Angeles for the Dodger Stadium Classic in 2015, falling to USC, 7-6, in a 12-inning thriller at Dedeaux Field.

Up against some of the toughest competition in the country, the men’s swimming and diving team came up just short of winning its second consecutive Pac-12 conference championship
The ninth-ranked Trojans, looking to defend their 2015 Pac-12 team championship, were led by several outstanding performances but couldn’t keep pace with Stanford over the course of the four-day event.
“I think Stanford took a page from our playbook last year,” USC head coach Dave Salo said. “They saw how we came together as a team and came to compete in the absence of one of their top swimmers from last year.”
The conference championships were a three-team race from the beginning: USC and Stanford finished the diving championships tied for the lead, but Cal — the second-ranked team in the nation — came storming back to take the lead after the first day of swimming. The Golden Bears won the 800-yard freestyle relay after coming in third in the 200-yard medley relay on Day 1, but USC wasn’t far behind: The Trojans took second place in each event, putting themselves in good position to compete for the rest of the championships.
On Day 2, Stanford found themselves on the podium six times over the course of four events, good enough to take the lead in the meet. USC junior Reed Malone, runner up in the 500-yard freestyle the last two years, won the event for the first time, posting the NCAA’s second-best time in the event with a 4:11.80 finish. Malone’s victory was USC’s only top-three finish on the day, and the Trojans remained in second place heading into the second half of the meet.
USC had a strong Day 3 as well: Malone won his second race of the championships in the 200-yard freestyle, an event the Trojans have not lost since 2009. USC sophomore Ralf Tribuntsov won the individual title in the 100-yard backstroke, ending California’s three-year win-streak in the event. Freshman Carsten Vissering took second in the 100-yard breaststroke, and the Trojans finished second in the 400 medley relay.
Despite only making it onto the podium three times on Day 3, Stanford held a 59-point lead going into the final day of the competition. USC freshman Patrick Mulcare won the 200-yard backstroke and junior Steven Stumph won his second consecutive 200-yard breastroke; Mulcare’s time of 1:39.64 was good enough to break Trojan Olympian Lenny Krayzelburg’s school record set back in 1997. Still, their individual victories would not be enough to pass Stanford, which finished the competition with 808 total points.
“We had so many outstanding efforts,” Salo said. “The maturity of the freshman class was a pleasant surprise.”
USC finished second with 700 points, followed by California with 628. With their runner-up finish, the Trojans have finished in the top two in the conference for consecutive years for the first time since 1997-1998.
“I think our guys experienced winning last year and the feeling of coming up short this season will drive their performance next year,” Salo said. “They found out that they like winning a lot more.”
The Trojans now look ahead to the NCAA Championships, which will be held at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center in Atlanta later this month.

The men’s volleyball team split a home-and-away series to No. 15 Cal Baptist University after falling at the Galen Center Saturday night in five games (25-20, 20-25, 19-25, 25-17, 12-15).
The match was the second of the pivotal series this week that could decide the postseason fate of both teams, but with the loss, the Trojans (4-14, 4-12 MPSF) dropped further behind Hawai’i for the eighth and final spot in the MPSF tournament.
The Trojans initially built off their momentum from Thursday night’s road sweep. They started the first game on a 7-3 run and never looked back, hitting .370 and adding 2.5 blocks.
“We caught them off-guard with a different lineup,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said.
Namely, USC had a younger lineup headlined by freshman outside hitter Woody Cook, who ended the match with 14 kills and a .370 hitting percentage.
“If you told me we were going to lose with an outside hitting .370, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Nygaard said.
Nevertheless, that was the case as the Trojans offense sputtered in games two and three. The second game had a different feel as the Trojans hitting regressed to .103. Errors crippled the offense. Cal Baptist’s hitting was ice cold at times, too, and the game was tied 19-19 after an emphatic solo block from junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder. The Trojans scored only one more point, however, before the Lancers heated up to win game two on a 5-0 run.
Cal Baptist (9-12, 4-12 MPSF) distributed attacking between five starters, with star senior outside hitter Rocky DeLyon struggling. Junior middle blocker Jackson Burge carried his team through offensive lulls at time by maintaining an errorless .462 through the first three games. His effort helped the Lancers outhit the Trojans by .183 points in game two and .86 in game three. Even as both teams’ hitting was hot and cold, there was no shortage of blocking. The Lancers tallied 10 through three games, including three solo blocks from junior middle blocker Kevin Vaz. USC added 7.5, already approaching their season average of eight per match.
The blocking kept USC off-balance in game three. The Trojans led 11-9 before allowing a 11-2 run. Nygaard made a couple of subs during that stretch, exchanging sophomore Jon Rivera for freshman Ryan Moss, senior Alex Slaught for Yoder and third senior Tommy Leonard for senior Josh Kirchner. USC went on a 3-1 run with the new lineup but still lost the game by six points.
“Even though we started off really good against them, they made adjustments that took us out of our comfort zone,” Nygaard said. “When we did respond, we responded with fury in game four and played a great game.”
Facing a loss that could effectively kill their chance for a MPSF tournament bid, the Trojans’ dominated game four which started with an ace that sparked a 14-4 USC run. Nygaard’s subs paid off as the three of them combined for eight kills and zero errors during that opening run. After that, USC coasted to a 25-17 win.
For the fifth time this season, USC saw a fifth game at the Galen Center. The Trojans split the first four 2-2 but could not finish it off.
Cal Baptist led 8-7 when the teams switched sides. The Lancers were hitting .875 in the game, but the Trojans’ errorless .500 was not too shabby either. Tied at ten apiece, Cal Baptist went on a 2-0 mini run capped with a powerful Enrique de Diego Garcia and Roy Powell block that forced Nygaard to call a timeout. Out of the timeout, USC scored a couple more points before falling 15-12.
“In game five, we made just one or two errors and they played flawlessly,” Nygaard said. “It’s tough when you allow a team to get to five and they play a perfect game. There’s not much you can do.”
Still, according to Slaught, this was a game the Trojans should have won.
“That’s a team we expect to beat, and we believe this [loss] is on us,” Slaught said. “We just didn’t execute on our side of the net.”
This loss might spell the end of the Trojans’ postseason hopes, pending  improbable turnaround.
USC next plays Concordia on March 16 at the Galen Center.
 
 
 
 
This is one of the worst teams in volleyball history in last dozen years. Reminiscent of one of the years under Turhan Douglas
winning only six matches. They sweep Cal Baptist on the road then lose to them on your home court. Mystified how AD Haden
could hire Nygaard ( ucla didn’t want his services ) when he was part of the problem under Ferguson if that was the case.

Stepping foot on the sands of Zuma Beach this weekend to start off the 2016 season, the No. 1-ranked USC beach volleyball team had a jam-packed schedule that saw them face off against four of the top six ranked teams in the nation all in a matter of just 30 hours.
However, cold and dreary weather in Malibu at the Pepperdine Kick Off put a damper on the defending national champions’ opening weekend, as the Women of Troy lost their first match in nearly a year to end their hopes of achieving yet another undefeated season. Still, head coach Anna Collier and the Women of Troy were able to come away with three quality wins to start the season off at 3-1 overall.
“I think we played really well on the weekend,” Collier said. “On Saturday, we came out and played a little tentative and not aggressively, so we sat the girls down and told them that no one was going to hand this to them. If we want to win, we’re going to have to fight for it and I think they changed their attitudes and fought really hard.”
After notching a 4-1 victory against No. 3-ranked Hawai’i to open up the Saturday slate, USC fell for the first time in thirty matches with a tight 3-2 loss at the hands of host and No. 2-ranked Pepperdine. The next day, USC crushed crosstown rival and No. 6-ranked UCLA 5-0 in the morning before closing out with a thrilling 3-2 victory over No. 4-ranked Long Beach State.
Collier was impressed with her team’s efforts as the Women of Troy endured severe weather conditions to pull out two wins on Sunday.
“When we train at USC, we never see wind like this,” Collier said. “It was 25-30 mile per hour winds and it was kind of ridiculous volleyball — you could barely bump or serve the ball over the net — so for them to stay mentally tough and fight to win those matches was very impressive to watch.”
Against the Rainbow Wahine, USC’s No. 1 pair of juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes got the Women of Troy off to the right start with an easy 21-11, 21-17 victory over Nikki Taylor and Mikayla Tucker. At the four position, sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante went big in their debut to put USC up 2-0 with a 22-20, 21-19 decision over Ginger Long and Hannah Zalopany, while juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler sealed the win at court three with a 21-16, 21-14 defeat of Ari Homayun and Emily Maglio. The No. 2 duo of junior Sophie Bukovec and senior Alexa Strange added to that total with a hard-fought 28-30, 21-15, 21-19 win over Lara Schreiber and Katie Spieler, while the five pair of sophomore Jo Kremer and graduate student Zoe Nightingale lost to Hannah Rooks and Ka’iwi Schucht (21-10, 19-21, 15-9) to finish out the 4-1 final team score.
The win pushed USC to 6-1 all-time against Hawai’i and marked 29 straight victories in a row, but that streak would be broken about an hour later against Pepperdine.
The No. 2-ranked Waves came out swinging on their home sand and found themselves up 2-1 after Madalyn Roh and Anika Wilson defeated Belton and Bustamante at court four (21-13, 21-19) and Kaity Bailey and Delaney Knudsen outlasted Bukovec and Strange (15-21, 21-18, 15-12) on court two. Eventually, a nail-biter from court five ended up going in Pepperdine’s favor, as Samantha Cash and Sarah Seiber defeated Kremer and Nightingale by a slim (14-21, 21-11, 22-20) margin and sealed the match.
The one and three pairs provided the only two points for USC on the day, with Claes and Hughes handling Heidi Dyer and Taylor Racich (21-11, 21-17) and Martin and Wheeler holding on against Skylar Caputo and Corinne Quiggle (21-19, 18-21, 15-9).
Overall, the loss snapped a program-best 29-match winning streak for the Women of Troy, as USC has only defeated Pepperdine at Zuma Beach once in five tries.
Sunday morning’s match against UCLA was the first 5-0 sweep of the season for the Women of Troy, as the two, three, and four pairs earned quick two-set wins to shut the door on the Bruins. The one and five pairs, Claes and Hughes and Kremer and Nightingale, both went the extra mile before winning in three, marking USC’s fourth straight victory over UCLA. In the rematch of the 2015 AVCA National Championship, USC relied on the experience of Martin and Wheeler in order to pull out the tight 3-2 win over No. 4-ranked LBSU. Claes and Hughes and Belton and Bustamante won their matches in two sets, leaving it all down to the juniors over at court three, who pulled out the 15-8 win in the deciding set to save the day for USC.
Now, the Women of Troy head back to Los Angeles for their home opener at Merle Norman Stadium this Thursday at 6 p.m. against Arizona State.

The women’s lacrosse team continued its outstanding start to the season, defeating Michigan and Vermont at McAlister Field. The Women of Troy demolished the Wolverines on Friday, 13-4, before downing the Catamounts, 18-7, on Saturday.
The defensive unit legitimized the team’s No. 11 national ranking by holding a talented Michigan team to just four goals on Friday afternoon.
Senior defender Courtney Tarleton scooped up four ground balls and forced three turnovers. Tarleton also had a pair of draw controls. The veteran anchor at the back helped guide the team to a convincing win, but the play of netminder Gussie Johns was also instrumental. Johns stopped seven shots and continued to look commanding between the pipes.
Senior attacker Caroline deLyra, who had a goal and five assists in the game, praised the defense after the victory.
“I think our defense is just really committing to our game plan,” deLyra said.
Communication at the back is essential in order to combat dynamic offensive teams like Michigan. The Wolverines had speedsters all over the field, which head coach Lindsey Munday had to account for in the game plan.
“They’re extremely fast and athletic,” Munday said.
Munday explained that the defenders had to get their feet moving defensively in order to slow down the Michigan attack. She praised her defense’s camaraderie and communication.
“They’re working really well as a unit,” Munday said. “It’s definitely all seven defenders plus our goalie who are just communicating.”
This Michigan team was aggressive, but USC’s excellent ball movement proved to be too much. The team’s work on the training ground is going a long way.
“I think we just are focusing on ourselves and just focusing on our own plays and game plans and going really hard against each other in practice,” deLyra said.
This group battles in practice. They also obviously work on perfecting their defensive organization.
“I think defensively we were kind of unbeatable,” junior attacker Michaela Michael said. “It was really awesome. I think our zone confused them a lot.”
The offense went to work as well. Junior attacker Michaela Michael found the back of the net five times, gliding past opposing players. Her blend of power and finesse has been a handful for every team USC has faced thus far.
“Offensively I think we just were patient and waited for opportunities,” Michael said.
Senior midfielder Amanda Johansen bagged a hat trick in the win. She marshaled the middle of the field throughout the afternoon and kept Michigan at bay with her work at both ends of the field.
After dismantling Michigan, the team hosted Vermont. USC led 11-4 at the break and cruised to victory, with eight different players scoring for the Women of Troy.
The Trojans’ next match will be against Stony Brook next Monday at home.
resolve and scored three unanswered goals to draw within one midway through the first half.
That was as close as the visitors would come.
USC led 11-4 at the break and applied the pressure in the second half as well. The team cruised to victory. Eight different players scored for the Women of Troy, which proves that this team has remarkable depth.
Against Vermont, Michael increased her season tally to 18 goals. She had 88 goals in her first two seasons with the team, and the junior is only getting better.
With seemingly no major weaknesses, this team has star players all over the field.
“We tried to just use everyone that we had on our team,” deLyra said. “We have a really stacked offense, so I think that’s really good for us and really beneficial that we have so many people that can put goals away.”

Under the vigorous direction of maestro Gustavo Dudamel, the Los Angeles Philharmonic took the audience on an adventure through Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 3, a sweeping work that managed to capture the full range of human emotion. The sold-out crowd gave a well-deserved, rousing ovation at the end of the evening that would not have been out of place at a rock concert.
The six-movement piece is Mahler’s longest symphony, and lasted 90 minutes without intermission. According to the program notes, Mahler penned a letter to his friend and violinist Natalie Bauer-Lechner in which he outlined the structure of his epic beginning with “Summer marches in” and ending with “What love tells me.”
The theme of nature was certainly present throughout the performance which featured bucolic melodies and trills in the four piccolos evoking the sound of birds. The first movement was a tribute to the brass with strident horns, joyful marches and sorrowful solos in the trombone and French horn. Punctuated with gentle, lilting melodies in the strings and woodwinds the first movement is still the most powerful of the six, culminating in a stirring and triumphant finale.
At Mahler’s request there is a brief respite between the first and second movement which begins gently, featuring the oboe. The composer’s love of nature is felt here as the listener is transported to an idyllic scene in the countryside. The brass is mostly quiet in this section with attention on the lush, lyrical melodies in the strings and woodwinds.
The audience was eased into the third movement with charming, airy refrains reminiscent of rural life. This movement features the most interesting orchestral arrangement — a flugelhorn playing from off stage creates a sense of nostalgia, like a long, forgotten childhood friend speaking to you again. The movement suddenly transitions into a darker and more mysterious tune, perhaps signaling the coming of night, before ending with a triumphant herald and a resounding bang.
The fourth and fifth movements introduce the vocalists — Tamara Mumford as the mezzo-soprano soloist along with the Women of the Los Angeles Master Chorale and the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus. Mumford shines in her role, her powerful instrument carrying over the orchestra as the children’s voices peal with the “bimm, bamm” of bells.
The sixth and final movement was a quasi-religious experience that transported the audience to an enchanted world. In his letter, Mahler wrote that the piece represented “what love tells me,” and this movement was indeed a testament to romance, complete with moments of ecstasy and those filled with a deep longing that tore at the soul. As the performance came to an end, people in the audience leaned forward, transfixed by the depth of the work and hoping that the end would never come (though when it did it was magnificent.)
Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic have outdone themselves in this rendition of Mahler’s classic. With a glorious opening, the performance held the audience until the end and left them desperate for more.

This weekend, L.A. Opera will present a production of Giacomo Puccini’s Madama Butterfly. As an avid lover of Italian opera, particularly Puccini, I’ve had tickets for opening night for months now. Since the opera’s original premiere in 1904, Madama Butterfly stands as one of the most performed operas in history. However, in recent years, Madama Butterfly has also received much scrutiny over the use of yellowface widely used throughout the production.
The story, which centers around a forlorn Japanese geisha abandoned by an American Lieutenant, remains close to the hearts of audiences, but those who obtain a more complex understand of the opera often wonder why. Yes, while the score is considered a Verismatic vocal-and-orchestral masterpiece laden with pathos, the story itself is subpar at best. The plot is drenched with themes of sexism, misogyny and colonialism, not to mention the racism that occurs when attempting to cast the show. The title role is seldom ever sung by a Japanese soprano; in fact, most opera houses use yellowface when a non-Asian singer is hired. Moreover, the entire chorus is usually put in yellowface as well; thus, these problematic performance practices often outshine the beauty of the music itself.
However, it must be noted, with caution to not excuse the use of yellowface, that the role of Cio-Cio San is exceeding difficult and requires colossal vocalism and stamina. For this reason, there are only a token few sopranos who can sing the role well; thus, the best lirico-spinto, regardless of racial background, are hired to sing it. Ironically, it was Leontyne Price, the acclaimed black soprano, who was deemed among the best Cio-Cio Sans in the business. Perhaps audiences are still a sucker for love stories revolving around a beautiful, forsaken ethnic minority who is saved by a white man in order to achieve the “American Dream.” Perhaps it is this reason that Madama Butterfly remains so popular with older patrons, and that the idea that citizens in non-Western countries need to be “saved” by Anglo-Saxons Americans in order to reach happiness appeals to the pathos of this demographic.
Likewise, the same argument applies for Turandot, Puccini’s other East Asian-inspired opera. Though the story is set Imperial China, and almost all characters are of East Asian descent, rarely is a production staged with a full set of Asian singers. Like Madama Butterfly, almost every principle character requires a substantially sized voice, thus roles are assigned to the best performers who can sing them. With this philosophy in mind, and again careful not to excuse these outdated forms of costuming, it is slightly easier to comprehend this practice of color-blind casting. But again, it must be stressed that it takes a very specific singer to pull off these roles; they require not only sublime vocal technique and crisp dramatic interpretation, but also the singers hired for these roles must posses a voice big enough to phonate over the size of an Italian-style orchestra. Obtaining a voice of this quality lies beyond size, race or build, but relies upon the physiological logistics of the vocal chords; any vocal pedagogue will explain in great detail that one cannot simply train their voices to “be bigger.”  This ability, this outstandingly rare ability, is one that a singer must be born with, and precisely why opera singers are among a select few in today’s society. Thus, the amount of singers able to produce such powerful vocalism is scant.
It is no secret that opera is a dying art form; it seems that millennials don’t have the same appreciation for classical music as previous generations. However, a contributing factor to opera’s declining popularity is perhaps due to the outdated performance practices employed in more traditional productions. And perhaps this is why younger generations, who believe these storylines are long outdated and deeply offensive, are straying from opera’s whitewashed perspective of life. And if opera companies wishes to thrive as they once did, the use of skin-color modification must be eliminated.

The Thornton School of Music and the School of Cinematic Arts hosted a broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera’s performance of Giacomo Puccini’s Manon Lescaut in Norris Cinema Theater on Saturday morning. The performance maintained the standard of what has become expected of The Met’s caliber, and mesmerized audiences around the world.
The broadcast, made possible through the Met’s Live in HD series, did not diminish the intensity of the performance showcased, compared to an in-person experience. The performance, even while more than 2,000 miles away, was so thoroughly executed that one could have easily been in France, the setting for the Manon Lescaut.
Upon the start of Act I, the audience meets the character Manon Lescaut, performed by Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais, and Des Grieux, sung by French tenor Roberto Alagna. A story between two ill-fated lovers, the opera embraces the theme of grand and highly expressive sorrow that Puccini’s score effectively portrays. The power of their performance was able to immediately envelop the audience and transport them into the life and times of Nazi-occupied France. The music moves from the orchestra through the cast, a large machine working to portray the story in the way only Puccini could envision. The lyricism and subtle romanticism of the opera was equally balanced with modern and large technical phrases.
The opera was in a constant dynamic state from start to beginning. There was never a stone unturned by the performers searching to bring out the unique qualities of each of their characters. They proved their ability to portray Puccini’s big picture in the face of the extremely powerful score and were also successful in picking up the smaller, more intricate details, moving the story along and reflecting on their characters’ backstories and predicaments. Conductor Fabio Luisi shined at the podium, perfecting Puccini’s vision. Bouncing between the performers and the musicians, the music of the opera is able to successfully draw out the agony and perpetual drama between Manon and Des, in a way that words alone could not express.
The broadcast also allowed the special opportunity for the audience to see behind the scenes, unlike the live audience at Lincoln Center. Hosted by American soprano Deborah Voigt, the broadcast allowed viewers to see interviews with Luisi, director Sir Richard Eyre and a tour of the costume shop and behind-curtain set changes between acts.
Though experiencing an opera performance via broadcast can have its drawbacks, the caliber of Metropolitan Opera’s performance filled the gap and took the audience on an equally superb journey, no matter the venue. The next Live in HD broadcast will take place on April 2 in the Norris Cinema Theater, featuring Puccini’s Madama Butterfly.

This weekend, I broke one of the cardinal rules of being a millennial — I willingly disconnected myself from social media. As a participant in the Posse Plus Retreat, I spent the weekend away from USC’s campus with a group of my peers to talk about the power of language in a diverse society.
This retreat was put on by the Posse Foundation, which connects a cohort of nine to ten undergraduate students from the same city with 55 top-tier universities across the nation. The students are given a full-ride scholarship as well as a built-in friendship with their posse to help motivate and support them throughout the college process. The university where they attend gives the scholarship money.
At USC, there are 19 students on the Posse scholarship. They are students from New York City, seemingly as far away as you can get from Los Angeles.
But a few years back USC said it would no longer provide the Posse scholarship. The last class of Posse at USC will graduate in 2017.
These types of scholarships — ones that yoke financial and emotional support together — are increasingly needed on USC’s campus, especially at a time when USC has surpassed a new milestone of being one of the most expensive universities to attend — beating the tuition prices of Harvard and Stanford. Tuition now sits at $51,442 for the 2016-17 school year, up $1,978 from last year.
The ticket price for USC means that certain types of students might be barred from attending such an elite university — possibly the type of students that Posse looks to bring on campuses across the U.S.
Jesse Metres, a senior majoring in public relations, is a Posse scholar on campus and a native New Yorker. She said, “every single good thing in my life is because of Posse” because her family would not have been able to afford a private university like USC otherwise.
As a private institution, USC has resources that can help alleviate financial burdens on students. For example, USC is well on its way to fundraising $6 billion by the end of 2018 as part of its campaign to further strengthen its endowment. Yet, in an increasingly competitive academic environment, most students need more than a check to help them get through their four years here.
USC should direct its funds toward Posse-like types of scholarships.  In addition to Posse giving a safety net to its students, the annual retreat they host brings a mix of 100 participants together to discuss issues of diversity and widens the benefits of the program to more of USC.
USC currently has a comprehensive merit scholarship program. For full disclosure, I am a recipient of it. Yet, in the way that USC admissions is intentional about getting a diverse student body on campus, they must also be intentional about the diversifying the scope of scholarships they support.
There have been efforts to expand the range of scholarships offered at USC. Last semester, Star Wars filmmaker George Lucas gave $10 million to the School of Cinematic Arts. Lucas designated the money to support black and Latino/a aspiring filmmakers through USC.
Yet, setbacks have not gone unnoticed. Not offering the Posse scholarship is one of them. One of the missions of Posse is to bring a fresh perspective to their campus community by bringing students who might have been overlooked by the regular admissions process.
Metres she said they were not advised about USC canceling its partnership with Posse.
“When USC said they weren’t accepting Posse scholarship, it made it seem like we weren’t valued on campus,” Metres said. “It felt like the monetary value of our scholarship was valued above the conversations of diversity we were bringing to the campus.”
Currently, USC is holding its Explore USC program. It’s a time when admitted students will come to campus, eat lunch at Campus Center, sit in on lectures in Taper Hall and try to decide if this is the place for them. It’s also a time when these admitted students will interview for scholarships that have the potential to set their lives on a new course.
That is the power of holistic scholarships at USC. If the University wants to continue to promote its diversity, openness and responsibility to all communities, then more consideration needs to be given to the types of scholarships USC chooses to support. One way would be to bring Posse back.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.
Jordyn:  Do you recommend a quota system for blacks, Latinos, orientals, Jews and Muslims? How does USC give preferential treatment to any of these minorities without shorting other, even less common minorities? Or, for that matter, shorting whites who also may be as qualified, or more so, than the minorities? I see no way but a quota system.
The Posse scholarship is a leadership based scholarship designed to bring smart, dynamic, and confident students who would not be found through traditional means and who can thrive on elite campuses. Posse’s definition of diversity is not just about cultural, ethnic or racial diversity, it includes economic, academic, religious, political and geographic diversity. (Ie WHITE students can also win this scholarship) These students go through a rigorous interview process and it is ignorant and disrespectful of you to reduce this wonderful program down to a quota system. It is also evident that you did not fully read or understand the point of this article and I hope next time you really do your research before spewing inaccurate facts. From Janelle, Posse 3.
Janelle, right and wrong. I am not well informed about the Posse program. But Jordyn wrote “USC should direct its funds toward Posse-like types of scholarships.”  “Posse-like” is not the same. Why did she not call for more Posse scholarships? Her phrasing instead suggested to me special treatment for preferred minorities, a totally different matter. I do not believe that one minority rates special treatment where another does not.
You wrote “Posse’s definition of diversity is not just about cultural, ethnic or racial diversity, it includes economic, academic, religious, political and geographic diversity.” Yes, that sounds excellent, I agree! Did I misread Jordyn? Did she actually mean Posse scholarships?
Incidentally, I was a USC scholarship student and remain intensely grateful to my alma mater for that. USC was very generous to me and changed my whole life. I would not have wanted to be turned down, though, with the perception, real or false, that I was perhaps a minority and could contribute to diversity; but was a non-preferred, unfashionable minority.
She was talking about Posse scholarships and posse-like scholarships would be ones that follow similar diversity standards that are not limited to race.

It is easier to make fun of trigger warnings than it is to address the root causes of trauma. It is easier to ascribe student demands to their sense of entitlement than it is to combat the issues of racism, sexism and transphobia on campus. Calling millennials sensitive, entitled and fragile does nothing to solve the issues of systemic oppression in America. But it does distract from those issues.
Criticizing millennials has become the go-to strategy for many defenders of the status quo, including social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. In a recent interview with with John Leo, editor of Minding the Campus, Haidt warns that college campuses are “going to get much, much worse” as “millennials come to college with much thinner skins.” He argues that as long as children are subject to anxious, overbearing parents, “we’re going to keep seeing these demands to never hear anything offensive.” When asked if he is referring to “micro-aggression, trigger warnings, safe spaces, and different forms of censorship,” Haidt agrees.
Not only does Haidt fundamentally misunderstand what students are asking for, he also suggests that the “academy” — the world of academia — is somehow worse off because college students are pointing out oppression, whether in the form of microaggressions or larger school policies. But millennials will not kill the academy. In fact, they will make it better.
Haidt’s argument is riddled with inconsistencies. He seems to suggest that while it is censorship to call something offensive, it is not censorship to try to silence the grievances of college students. Haidt is worried about students addressing racism on campus but not about actual racist acts that occur on college campuses. This kind of contradictory, offensive rhetoric is what happens when calls for change are conflated with a sense of entitlement and prioritization of student wellness is confused with censorship.
USC has seen its own campus activism grow and develop over the last year. Most notably, perhaps, the Campus Climate Resolution called for serious transformation of the University’s approach to the issues of diversity and inclusion. But asking for a reinstatement of the diversity requirement, for example, is not the result of entitlement, just as the desire to see a more diverse curriculum is not the result of overbearing parents. Haidt fails to realize the larger context in which millennials were born. Although he correctly points out that millennials were born in a time of “anxiety” and rising crime, it was also a post-civil rights and post-second wave feminism society. So if millennials feel entitled, they feel entitled to the society their parents and grandparents imagined and fought for. They feel entitled to a college experience free from rape, intimidation and unequal opportunities. More students addressing racism on college campuses is not the result of helicopter parents, but of more students of color participating in campus life and yet, still not being fully included. The need to create safe spaces on campuses is not because millennials are oversensitive, but because one in four women will be raped or be a victim of attempted rape while attending college.
Haidt, and others like him, are not genuinely concerned about censorship in the academy. They are worried about losing their monopoly on having a voice.  As college students demand to be heard, it is disgraceful for previous generations to respond with ad hominem attacks and cries of censorship.  Haidt — and others like him — must learn that the academy will survive greater diversity, but it may not survive the attempts to keep it grounded in oppressive ideologies.
I side with Mr. Haidt. Students with their “safe spaces,” “micro-agressions,” “trigger warnings” and freakish sensitivity to innocent talk or writing are nothing but timid, fearful, overly delicate creatures. Vile racial insults or jokes, harsh fighting words and mean insults? Frank racism or other forms of unfair discrimination? Yes, suppress those actions and punish miscreants. Such students badly need correction, and if not correctable, they do not belong in our USC family. But this other terror of any tiny word that can be misconstrued as a slight? That reflects badly on students so weak and cowardly as to demand protection. Or as those students might say, “we are entitled to be protected from anything we might misunderstand or find slightly critical of us.”

The top-ranked Trojans hit the road to Tempe, AZ, on Saturday to face off against the Sun Devils and came away with an 8-3 win over Arizona State. The game marked the official start of the MPSF season for the Trojans, taking their record to 1-0 in MPSF and 12-0 overall. 
USC’s defense held the Sun Devils to just 3 goals over four periods of play with big defensive stops coming from freshman goalie Amanda Longan. Longan tallied five saves, including a 5-meter penalty shot block. 
While Longan helped shut down ASU offense, the Trojans started taking the lead early in the game 2-0 with a pair of goals from juniors Stephania Haralibidis and Brigitta Games. ASU answered back with a power play goal, trailing closely behind the Trojans. 
In the second quarter, the Trojans fired off another goal from top scorer of the evening Avery Peterson who nailed in her first of three goals to bring the score to 3-1. The Sun Devils answered back closing the gap to 3-2, but the Trojan offense lit up the cage with a pair of goals from the junior pair Stephania Haralabidis and Ioanna Haralabidis.
The Trojans switched into high gear in the second half putting two more goals on the board from Brianna Daboub and Peterson during the third quarter while Longan recorded a third quarter shutout. ASU answered back, making the score 6-3, but the Trojans still wanted more. In the fourth quarter, Games fired one into the cage from the two-meter position while Peterson converted a hat trick to bring the final score to 8-3.
USC is the lone undefeated team in the MPSF conference.
