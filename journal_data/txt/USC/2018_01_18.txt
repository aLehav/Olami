On Monday, the nation collectively took a day off to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

For many, it was a day to celebrate the growth of cultural inclusivity in the United States over the past 50 years. For others, it was a time for reflection on the oppression and adversity many racial minority groups faced during the Civil Rights Movement. But for the rest, it was just a day off.
For USC — a school boasting the second largest international student body in the U.S. — MLK Day should hold at least some importance. In its entirety, King’s cause has become synonymous with the fight for diversity and acceptance within both local communities and institutions of power — the same diversity and acceptance that is woven into the fabric of the University’s student body. 
In light of MLK Day, the University needs to learn an important lesson: Promoting a truly inclusive environment requires more than just meeting quotas. The reality is that USC’s advertised demographics do not necessarily paint a complete picture of student representation on campus.
Statistics are hard to argue with. For the 2017-18 academic year, 14 percent of enrolled undergraduate students were Latinx. Of the Fall 2017 freshman class, 17 percent were first-generation students. The University also ranks 8th in the nation in ethnic diversity.
What these facts fail to mention, however, is the interplay between economic and racial diversity. College-aged minority populations emerge from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, and college admissions should reflect that. But that does not mean accepting more low-income students necessarily equates to greater diversity. Low-income white students and wealthy or economically stable students of color also must have a presence on campus, and the unique experiences and world views they bring to the table have considerable value. 
In addition, undocumented students are another overlooked population often excluded from the dialogue around campus diversity. Currently, undocumented applicants have a hard time affording colleges: The scholarships that exist either have high barriers to entry or are not marketed sufficiently. Furthermore, those who are accepted to a campus like USC are unlikely to find the support they need — university administrators often market the school as diverse, but the campus does not offer a resource center specifically for their needs. In fact, many California universities such as UCLA and Cal State Fullerton offer their own support systems for Dreamers. Of all universities, USC — ranked fourth in the nation in economic diversity — should be offering this. 
Numbers and economics aside, the University must foster a sense of inclusivity by promoting student organizations that unite people of the same background. For instance, there is the Asian Pacific American Student Services, which promotes and reinforces the Asian-American community that is so prevalent on campus. The organization’s various bonding activities and educational field trips create feelings of belonging and camaraderie that should be experienced by the variety of ethnic minority groups within the Trojan Family.
Shifting the focus from the student population, the issue of diversity cannot be addressed without analyzing the demographics of its faculty. Of the University’s tenured faculty in 2016, just 2 percent was African American, 14 percent was Asian American, 3 percent was Latinx and 76 percent was white — numbers that are fairly identical to those put up by the average university within the Association of American Universities. Of course, there is an obvious discrepancy here. And while it’s perfectly fair to trust USC’s techniques in hiring instructors are based on qualifications, the dramatic difference in the number of minority and white faculty also suggests a lack of inclusivity on the University’s part. Put simply, a diverse faculty better represents a diverse student population. If USC wants to brand itself as one of the most inclusive universities in the country, then its student body and faculty must reflect this. 
To firmly establish a racially diverse, economically diverse and qualified student population, USC must focus on the next generation of scholars. Right now, the University is making a commendable effort to better the educational standards of the local Los Angeles community. The Neighborhood Academic Initiative, for instance, offers an academic enrichment program to prepare South and East L.A. students for the rigor of university curriculum. Looking forward, creating such a productive and encouraging presence in urban environments is crucial to boosting diversity down the pipeline.
Numbers do not lie, but while the University is doing better than many in terms of establishing diversity in its numbers, many students may experience a different reality. In the realm of cultural diversity, there is no fitting conclusion to write, no tangible finish line to cross; college campuses — and all influential institutions, for that matter — must find a way ensure the diverse members of their student bodies are not only represented, but also embraced with a sense of belonging. The world may be a more inclusive place than the one MLK lived in, but there is still a long and arduous journey ahead. 
I like Thomas Sowell’s take on topics such as “affirmative action, diversity,” and the like. SJWism is sooo lame.

The revelations of #MeToo, a social campaign to empower women to share their experiences with sexual misconduct, have been rolling out almost nonstop since November 2016. And despite the simplicity of its intent — a society where women are safe and respected — as movements regarding how we treat women so often are, #MeToo has become a source of bipartisan conflict, confusion and outrage across the political spectrum both in Hollywood and on Capitol Hill. 
New allegations against comedian Aziz Ansari, a vocal feminist advocate and the mastermind behind the groundbreaking Netflix original series Master of None, have only added fuel to the flames. On Saturday, a 23-year-old female photographer accused Ansari of sexual coercion, claiming they had gone on a date that ended with the actor repeatedly attempting to engage her in sexual contact despite her numerous verbal and nonverbal objections. The report spared no detail and offered a jarringly familiar portrait of sexual misconduct, not as the overtly criminal, stereotypical back-alley rape, but as a wrong so commonplace men and women alike have come to accept it as normal. 
A month after the advent of #MeToo in December, the internet became a cesspool of hot takes, op-eds and tweets arguing that men now live in an oppressive new world in which they must be afraid to hug women. 
It’s uncomfortable for me to dignify a reaction so out-of-touch by offering a counter-argument, but I’ll say what must be said: The egocentrism of men in whom #MeToo has instilled fear rather than solidarity is part of the problem, whether or not they’ve ever sexually abused a woman in their lives. 
Women are taught early on to not only accept gendered fear, but structure every aspect of their lives around it. From everyday decisions like never walking alone at night to deciding not to report a powerful man in their workplace for sexual misconduct for the sake of their economic stability, fear of being violated, hurt, threatened or taken advantage of has shaped the female identity for centuries. 
Beyond speaking your truth and empowering other women, there’s nothing to gain and — as we’ve seen with survivors who speak up and face sexual harassment, threats and even arson, which one accuser of former Alabama Senate candidate and alleged child molestor Roy Moore was subjected to — everything to lose from coming forward. To be a man and suggest that a woman would risk her safety, career and reputation just to hurt you is a true testament to the boundlessness of the male ego, and a reflection of the insecurities bred in a dominant group whenever a historically marginalized one makes any gain whatsoever.
In either case, Ansari’s story has generated such a strong reaction because the prevalence of his alleged actions has led so many to believe a man pressuring a woman to have sex with him, and forcing sexual acts on women despite clear signs of hesitation or verbal objections, is a sort of gray area leaving room to debate whether a woman has the right to feel violated. 
Perhaps what Ansari’s accuser described is a moral gray — perhaps, indeed, for some men, whether or not to hug a female coworker is, too. More than anything, what this latest #MeToo story reminds us is how, just as so many women identify with the women who come forward, many men are able to identify with men who are accused. Perhaps not with former Today Show co-host Matt Lauer and his notorious button, nor with Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein and the numerous allegations of rape against him, but with Ansari: a man who may not have done anything transparently illegal, but crossed lines and made a woman feel violated and unsafe nonetheless. 
Throughout last weekend, Twitter was abuzz with debate between Ansari’s apologists and women like feminist author Jessica Valenti, who argues a key reason so many men are coming to the defense of Ansari on the technicality of legality is that they don’t want to believe something they’ve probably done at some point is wrong. The reality is that trying to convince a woman who has expressed either reluctance or outright objection to engage in a sexual act is coercion. Any man who has never been subjected this has no right to argue that it isn’t wrong, that women have no right to feel violated by their consent being trivialized and disrespected with bargaining, that women have no right to speak up and identify their experiences as sexual abuse.
When it comes to #MeToo, I agree that the consideration of scenarios from a legal perspective can be important. For example, let’s talk about creating effective laws to protect women’s rights in the workplace and protect women who report harassment and assault from retaliation. Let’s talk about the legal reforms that need to happen so we don’t live in a country where one in six woman will experience rape or attempted rape; two-thirds of sexual assaults will go unreported; and sexual crimes are the least likely to result in prosecution, conviction or punishment of the perpetrator.
But beyond that, it would be small-minded to suggest #MeToo should limit itself to cases of tangible sexual crimes that could be tried in court. The movement is certainly about fair laws, but it’s also about the oppressive nature of our culture — one that too often degrades the value of women’s consent with cheap legal arguments that miss the point, that absolves grown men of responsibility on the basis of their ignorance, while savaging women who dare to say a man’s treatment caused them to feel violated and threatened.

Ironic that someone as lascivious as yourself is such a crusader for women’s rights. You run an empty column for ideals you don’t even come close measuring up to. When people don’t respect you, it’s not because you’re a woman. Maybe it’s because you’ve been seen piss drunk and puking on the floor instead of being a dignified woman who deserves respect. Yeah, you’re a real role model in that outfit, with that lifestyle, and your empty rhetoric. Aren’t you?
“Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her” John 8:7
I’m going to pray for you both
God Bless!
…and the feminazi with a silver spoon in her mouth begins to lecture us about male privilege in 3.. 2.. 1…
I thought Ms. Cheung and her group of hungry ladies retired but apparently not.
Men do what they do and they have since Adam.  Women need only understand mens’ motives and nearly all these “new” found issues between men and women will be resolved.
There was no such thing as sexual assault in my sorority days.   It was called being “Fresh” and quick slap of the boy’s hand ended it.   If you pushed yourself on girl, you’d never get another date with any girl in my sorority.  We girls stuck together and didn’t allow ourselves to be sexualized as many of you ladies do today. 
Simple Advice: Respect yourself and don’t get drunk, don’t do drugs or allow yourself to be used by men in a sexual manner before marriage.
God Bless and we continue to pray for you all!
You say of the Ansari date that it was:  “a date that ended with the actor repeatedly attempting to engage her in sexual contact despite her numerous verbal and nonverbal objections”
Actually, there were no verbal cues. Go back and reread.  She was upset that he didn’t pick up on her non-verbal cues.
Kylie Cheung, Insulting men by calling them egocentric and calling them fearful is not a way to converse to persuade them to look at your views.  Putting people on the defensive with ad hominem attacks is not a wise way to build a coalition.  Just a clue.
Women in the public education must stop preying on underaged boys.
“No means no,” is a useful statement that can help a society understand a specific boundary, and what is socially expected from it. But that doesn’t mean that our future selves don’t look back at our past selves and determine that we wish our past no’s were yes’, and vice versa.
I think that it is true that women are not safe by way of the fact that they tend to be physically weaker and an intense object of desire. The woman in Aziz’s situation, if she wanted to feel more safe, could have left him or demanded to be taken home. Intimacy is a give and take. Some women want more give, some want more take (and men too). That Aziz would have been seen as more amicable by this woman if he behaved differently doesn’t mean that he behaved wrongly. Both parties have boundaries that they can draw. And it is always a bumpy road in coming to terms with others’ boundaries.
My personal problem with #metoo is that Oprah’s inclusion of it indicated to me the expectation of a society where others would be able to treat others in a way that they want, without having to personally delineate the way a person wants to be personally treated.
making fun of noobs is fun lol…
The MeToo movement started as ‘social advocacy’ and ‘female empowerment’, which is good. However, the movement was immediately hijacked by all of the man-hating, feminazis of the world. The MeToo movement has devolved, at the hands of women, to become nothing worth listening to. It is abundantly clear that it is NOT about equality, or reclaiming female dignity… it has become about attacking ALL males. I support legitimate issues… not this non-stop ‘bitch session’.
Many of the men caught up in the metoo campaign are getting what they have long deserved. That said I think this article stinks of man hate( “a true testament to the boundlessness of the male ego” is a blanket statement aimed at all men ). I Believe Metoo is an important movement that should continue. I also think there will be some innocent men will pay a heavy price. Some women will feel its fair as they have paid their price for centuries. But we are all people and we all hurt and get hurt. Many of us love and try to spead that love. that will be the cure for this particularly nasty moment in humanity. not bashing one side or the other.
“…offered a jarringly familiar portrait of sexual misconduct,”
Did you even read the story? He did nothing wrong and has no need to apologize for anything. When she said no, he stopped. The fact that there are aspects of the encounter that she regrets, like engaging in more than one instance of oral sex, is not on him, it’s on her. He quite obviously, by her own words, was willing to stop when told no.
Looking for her 15 minutes and not caring who gets hurt….it’s only a man, after all.

When walking into the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery, in the Roski School of Art and Design, viewers are immediately struck by the impact of light in contrast with the brightly lit bare white walls, twelve minimalist photographs fill the walls, each an investigation of the role of light in our perception of the world. 
The exhibit is on display at the Helen Lindhurst Fine Arts Gallery from Jan. 15 to Jan. 25. Photo courtesy of Abbie Stellar.
The exhibition is the brainchild of Roski student Abbie Stellar, a senior majoring in art. The installation, titled “Seeing light (or: to see light),” is a series of photographs that encapsulate emotion through seemingly basic but often overlooked aspects of photography: light and color. Her work is captured on film, and each snapshot is permeated with an indescribable feeling unique to each viewer.
“Sometimes I would notice these moments of light and not have my film camera on me,” Stellar said. “So I’d make note of the time that the light was such, using my phone, and come back another day at the same time in order to take the photo with my film camera. It was really a process of looking and observing, and then either coming back again at the same time to catch the light, or happening to stumble upon it at the right time with my camera.”
Moving clockwise through the exhibit, it is unclear whether these works of art are paintings that replicate reality or photographs that perfectly capture moments in time. Stellar is aware that her photographs resemble paintings, and hopes for double takes from viewers. 
“I hope that the work shows these painting-like qualities of photography and comments on the beauty of a still moment, as well as how the two are fairly synonymous with one another,” Stellar said. “I want to promote this idea of observation and awareness of one’s surroundings.”
Some find that the emotive qualities Stellar has captured only come from the tip of a brush. The various patterns by unidentifiable objects she has chosen “hark to color field paintings of the Abstract Expressionist movement,” according to Stellar.
In addition to Expressionism, which is centered on the subjectiveness of perception, Stellar has a keen eye in creating an Impressionist feel. Impressionism is focused on an accurate depiction of light and how it affects objects, and there is no doubt that Stellar’s photographs do just that. Lightforms blur at the edge of our peripheries, but they focus when met with hard edges, such as in the three part “Light” photo series (photographs eight, nine, and ten). 
The exploration of color sneaks up on observers. At first, viewers are deposited into a monochromatic world: “The fleetingness of it all” (photograph one), is a multi gray incident of horizontals. Viewers ask just the question Stellar was hoping for: “What could this possibly be?”
When “Sonata” (photograph four) dips into the world of browns, viewers see yet another aspect to the beauty of light, and in this case, how it interacts with color.
“The light has so much of a presence on its own, and it takes on these various forms that are like that of moments found in painting that we sometimes overlook by just looking at the picture as a whole,” Stellar said. “I hope that the work emphasizes this idea to be aware of these smaller things.”
Stellar’s exhibit will be on display from Jan. 15 to Jan. 25. Her opening reception is this Thursday from 5-7 p.m.

In 2015, Børns launched onto the music scene with his dance-ready rock hit “Electric Love.” The song was featured on commercials and even got a shout-out from pop sensation Taylor Swift who called it an “instant classic.” He used distinct sounds of alternative rock as a template to showcase his own vocal ability, mixing ’80s pop, alt-rock and indie folk in the production to create the sound of his biggest hit and thereafter debut record, Dopamine. The artist’s debut album was an impressive introduction, seeming to indicate that Børns would be a household name by the time he released his sophomore record. 
As always, however, the dreaded second album can either make or break an artist. Blue Madonna unfortunately fails to offer anything new or exciting. The record repeats many of the same sounds heard on Dopamine, with little to distinguish itself as a standalone project. 
While it fails to make a lasting impression, the record has some moments of promise. One of the most intriguing moments of the record comes in its opening track, “God Save Our Young Blood.” The track encapsulates the younger generation of today with its lyrics, “spinning and [they] can’t sit still.” The fast pace of the world today is reflected in the song, and it starts Blue Madonna on a promising note. Although the refrain is a bit too repetitive, alternative pop singer Lana Del Rey loans her vocals to pleasantly blend with Børns’ higher pitch.
The album relies on a collaboration with pop singer Lana Del Rey, electronic beats and high-quality production. Photo courtesy of Interscope Records.
Other songs like the psychedelic single “Faded Heart” and high energy “We Don’t Care” are equally exciting. The mid-tempo chorus on the former is euphoric, providing the pleasant image of being young and in love. “We Don’t Care” draws inspiration from the Beatles with production similar to that of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. It features some of the only socially conscious lyrics on the record — “the world is on fire but we don’t care.” 
Unfortunately, several tracks on Blue Madonna are simply indistinguishable from one another, and superficial lyrics often fail to save songs from banality. “Man” finds Børns lost beneath an ’80s pop beat; the “If the world’s gonna end, I wanna be your friend,” and “When the lights go dim, I wanna be your man” couplets are overly simple, cliché lyrics.
“Iceberg” likewise hides beneath its production. The track has a sound distinct enough to succeed and even impress, but like many other tracks, it could have benefited from stronger lyricism. 
Blue Madonna’s best moments lie in its high-quality production. “Second Night of Summer” mixes synthesizers with a piano beat, while “Tension” incorporates a Caribbean sound that has become increasingly popular in popular music today. “I Don’t Want U Back” presents an EDM-influenced beat mixed with an autotuned Børns singing over the beat. The singer’s utilization of autotune in this track is jarring relative to the rest of the album’s production, but it works within the sound of the song. 
While Blue Madonna isn’t revolutionary, Børns’ soothing voice accompanied by a solid production save this project from being completely overlooked.

Ryan Song | Daily Trojan
While everyone stayed up until midnight on Jan. 1 to make their toasts to 2018, my family waited for K-Pop sensation BTS to perform its hit “MIC Drop” on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve. Certainly, I was proud to watch this group perform on live television, just how its impressive YouTube statistics completely shocked me. However, this moment’s significance extended beyond that. Generally speaking, I was impressed by each member’s distinct personalities, as they didn’t seem to feel relegated to one characteristic, a problem that the group helped me resolve recently. Indeed, BTS helped me acknowledge my Korean heritage after I distanced myself from it. 
Every New Year’s, my family meets with our relatives. I remember eating tteokguk, a rice cake soup, and listening to everyone talk in Korean. Because I don’t speak the language, this annoyed me, as they never seemed to connect with me in English. However, I enjoyed visiting their businesses because they spoke English to their customers. It obviously wasn’t their first language, but I appreciated it when they spoke the same language I did.
During high school, I became heavily involved in activities related to my Korean heritage. One summer, I flew to Washington, D.C. to advocate for North Korean refugees; another, I walked 40 miles in support of Liberty in North Korea, an organization that smuggles North Koreans refugees to safety. My Eagle Scout project even involved interviewing Korean War veterans about their personal experiences.

After a while, I began to feel like these activities were forced upon me. The problem was not the activities themselves, but rather the extent to which people overemphasized their importance. While I prepared for my black belt test, a family friend said to think about the North Korean orphans that didn’t have this opportunity, but her words failed to inspire me. I wanted to find a balance between my American and Korean backgrounds, but I felt my family pushing me to associate myself with the latter.
My inner conflict culminated this past summer when I broke down in tears in a parking lot. What began as a simple conversation between me and my parents transformed into an hour of verbal sparring, as I let out everything that bothered me about my Korean-centered upbringing. My parents calmly clarified why they emphasized my heritage so much. In the end, I understood their perspective.
Although I found peace with my heritage after this conversation, I still felt distant from it, as I intentionally avoided joining any Asian groups last semester. However, when I discovered BTS, my appreciation for my heritage was rekindled. It didn’t come from the fact that they were a group from Korea, but rather from the fact that I discovered something related to my heritage that genuinely interested me. This past break, for the first time, I asked my mom to teach me Korean, as I tried reading the lyrics to BTS’ hit songs “DNA” and “MIC Drop.”
It seems fitting that this group led me back to the culture that I’ve avoided for so long. For the first time since 2012, I’m incredibly proud to be Korean American. And as we start the new semester, having finally settled into USC as a transfer student, this renewed appreciation could not have come at a more perfect time.

Awww, I’m happy that BTS helped you reconnect with your roots. this kind of things happens also often when you have children and you begin to want to transmit.
Korea can indeed really be proud of BTS, they’re incredibly talentend, hardworking, polite, kind, genuine, proud of where they come from, there’s a strong bond between them, even after 8 years they still leave together, their teamwork is unprecedented, meaning that they convey lots of Korean values. And at the same time they’re funny, dorky, cool, which makes them also very modern, relatable & ppl want to identify to them.
I heard similar stories about bts inspiring people to accept themselves, work hard to achive their dreams, enjoy life and be happy during the journey.  Bts stories are relatable to many unhappy people, the underdogs.  How to find happiness and reach the dreams persistenky and positively. They are really one if a kind singers,
BTS really do amazing things as in breaking language barriers and music charts that no other Korean artists has done multiple times. Your story was very beautiful and don’t let go of your heritage. As a ARMY, who is not Korean, but is a half Guatemalan, half Mexican American girl who does not understand Korean at all, but however I love their music and them all, BTS is one of a kind. they made me think differently and be more openminded and yet accept music, no matter what language it is. Their music brings peace in me and really shows off that asian representation we been waiting for a long time in the music charts. also please don’t forget who you are and where you came from. Although BTS did come in the perfect time. <3
Please embrace your korean heritage while you can. My mom came to the US in 1959 after meeting my dad while he was stationed in South Korea. She lost contact with her family and didn’t speak to them again until 2005.  By that time, her mom had passed away.  She missed her home country terribly. My dad was a good provider but didn’t encourage her native culture. We, as her children, missed out. Because he wasn’t supportive, she never taught us Korean.  She passed away in 2015.  At my age of 49, I now feel completely cheated out of my Korean heritage. I’d love to learn to speak korean, but the person who could’ve taught me, and who I’d love to converse with, is no longer here.  My daughter likes BTS and through them, we’ve renewed our interest in our korean side.  But there are some things you can’t get back once they’re gone.  Don’t make the same mistake.  Be good to your parents and learn as much about your culture as you can.
The article was simply written which spoke of a boy’s (man’s) search for his identity.  He was at a crossroads, until he found himself in BTS songs.  Their songs do tell stories that we can relate to.  I’m happy for you Ryan.  You’ll shine even brighter!
I’m so happy and proud when I reading this article.. Hoping you will meet our boys.. Fighting!! thank you for sharing this story of yours.. It means a lot for us ( ArmyFam) and BTS.
I’m very happy for you!! Thank you for sharing the meaningful impact the boys have had on you. I hope you’ll be able to see them in person one day and not just on TV.
That was a really interesting read. Thank you.
I’m happy for you!! I can relate so much, I’m a full Japanese-American who can’t speak Japanese at all because of the way that I was brought up, it’s a constant feeling of tug-of-war between your two “homelands.”  Liking BTS has helped me realize that I should just be unapologetic about who I am and what I like, I’m glad that they are helping you on your journey :)
oh you were doing something really meaningful with your live, helping North Korean rufugees etc.
I understand that you could feel a little burdened at some point of your life because it seems like some of your activities were heavily influenced by your parents (doesn’t mean you didn’t enjoy doing it) but maybe the BTS interest came just from you and allowed you to connect more emotionally with your Korean heritage. it’s great that you feel at peace with yourself now :)
That was a great read! I’m so happy for you ))
The impact BTS has is vast. From Asian Americans FINALLY having entertainment media representation on par with other entertainers, not in its own niche or stereotype (yes, it’s still in a kpop niche but breaking out of those boundaries regardless of what kpop community decides) to those that feel literal mental healing with their lyric messages and identity.
What a beautiful story !! ??
I can relate to your story so much and Thank You for sharing. I hope to see you at one of BTS’ concerts in the future :D
Hoping to meet BTS and ArmyFam in the future too.. K-diamonds and I-Lovelies ..Hwaiting..!

After a weekend sweep of Colorado and Utah, the women’s basketball team returns to the Galen Center to face off against Stanford and Cal. 
Against Cal, senior forward Kristen Simon recorded 20 points and 11 rebounds. However, it wasn’t enough as USC fell 64-76. Alex Zhang | Daily Trojan
Last Friday, the team demolished Colorado in an offensive showcase as they pounded the Buffaloes for 86 points en route to a 35-point victory. Against Utah, both teams had trouble scoring the basketball, but ultimately, the Trojans were able to maintain an early lead and took down the Utes, 58-47. Junior guard Aliyah Mazyck led the way in both games, scoring a career-high 29 points against Colorado and led the team again with 20 against Utah. But defense was key in both victories. 
“I think, this weekend, our defense really flourished,” senior guard Sadie Edwards said.  “I think we really executed and disrupted other teams on the defensive end. We didn’t let them get into a rhythm or do what they wanted to do or what they were comfortable doing, so I think that’s something that we can control and carry over to this weekend.”
This Friday, the team will welcome the Stanford Cardinal to the Galen Center. Stanford currently sits at 11-7 with a 5-1 Pac-12 conference record. One of their victories came against the Trojans back on New Year’s Eve when they held on to win 72-65. In that game, senior guard Brittany McPhee led the way for Stanford, stuffing the stat sheet with 21 points, eight rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocks. Stanford outshot USC with a 45.5 percent overall field goal percentage to the Trojans’ 35.5 percent and out-rebounded the Women of Troy 41-31. Stanford is led by the tandem of McPhee and junior forward Alanna Smith, but Stanford has a deep team that can all contribute and have been steady at executing in half-court settings. 
“Both of [Cal and Stanford’s] games are different so Stanford is really, really, really good at executing in the half court. They obviously play for an incredible coach; they play extremely hard. We watched film and we’ve looked at a lot of the mistakes that we’ve made in that game, so I think we’re really looking forward to getting on the court and just competing,” Edwards said. “I think it’s going to be a good game, I think it’s going to be a great weekend for us and an incredible opportunity.”
Then on Sunday, No. 21 Cal comes to Galen Center with a 13-4 overall record and a 4-2 Pac-12 conference record. This game will also be a rematch as the Golden Bears defeated the Trojans 76-64 on Dec. 29. The Trojans were once again outgunned in their previous game against Cal, as they shot 38.1 percent to Cal’s 45.6 percent. 
The Trojans were led by senior forward Kristen Simon in this contest as she posted a double-double of 20 points and 11 rebounds but she was matched by junior center Kristine Anigwe with 16 points and 13 rebounds double-double. The Golden Bears sport a deep team, capable of scoring in bunches and with efficiency; Kristine Anigwe remains the biggest offensive threat as she averages around 18 points and is coming off a dominant weekend where she totaled 56 points and 27 rebounds over two games. 
“Cal also executed really well in the half court against us but Cal has one of the best players in the country in [Anigwe]. We trust our preparation. We’ve learned and we’ve grown a lot even though that was just two weeks ago. I think we’re a lot better now than we were and we’re just going to go out there and compete, play hard.”
With an electrifying rout of Colorado last weekend, the Trojans are hoping their momentum can continue against two strong teams in Cal and Stanford. The Trojans’ defense was notable in the past two games against Colorado and Utah. Their disruption and focus helped them stop Colorado’s offense in the second half and kept Utah from cutting into the lead. They will have to key in on their defense to stop Cal’s high-powered offense and Stanford’s deep reserves. 
“We gave up a lot of transition points against Stanford the first time around, so that’s something we can always control; we can get back on defense, we can stop the ball, we can run the floor harder,” Edwards said. “We gave up a lot of offensive rebounds, which is also something we can control; box out. And there was a few of their actions that we got beat on, we watched them in film, we’ve made an adjustment now, we’ve gone over it today, we’ve drilled it, we have great practice guides that come in and help us going over that so we’ll be prepared for that.”
The Trojans will face Stanford on Friday at 8 p.m. and battle No. 21 Cal on Sunday at 1 p.m. Both games will be televised on Pac-12 Los Angeles and Pac-12 Networks.

This weekend, business picks up, as the women’s tennis team faces Loyola Marymount on Friday and UC Santa Barbara on Saturday. Both games will be played on the Trojans’ home court at Marks Stadium. The Women of Troy aim to begin the year with a winning streak after experiencing a slow start in 2016.
Senior Gabby Smith is one of three upperclassmen on the eight-woman team. Daily Trojan file photo.
Last season was a disappointing one for former head coach Richard Gallien and his team. The Trojans finished 13-10, with a 6-4 conference record. While they managed to earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament, USC lost in the first round to Denver, one year after making the semifinals.
Gallien stepped down after 22 years of coaching at USC, signifying the end of an era for the program.
To fill the position, Athletic Director Lynn Swann hired Alison Swain from Williams College. At Williams, Swain won eight Division III championships, with the most recent being last season.
Taking after the 38-year-old Swain, the roster is also full of youth. Senior Gabby Smith, who finished last year ranked No. 29 in the country for singles, and senior Madison Westby, who went 24-13 in singles play in 2016-17, are the squad’s only seniors, with junior Rianna Valdes joining them as the sole other upperclassman.
In order to make a return to the NCAA Tournament, Swain will have to rely on young talent, such as freshman Alexa Corecoloeotes and sophomore Angela Kulikov.
This weekend, the team continues its new beginning, looking to start off on the right foot with a new coach and relatively inexperienced roster.

After opening the season with an explosive 18-0 victory over LMU, the women’s water polo team is setting a tone for a season focused on redemption.
Senior driver Brianna Daboub is one of eight seniors on the Trojans’ squad. In her junior season, Daboub tallied 36 goals over the course of 20 games with 10 multi-score matches. Jo Danielle Esteban | Daily Trojan
Last season ended a game earlier than the Trojans had hoped, as the reigning champs fell a point short of playing in the NCAA final in a heartbreaking 11-10 loss to Stanford. The team enters this year with the same goal in mind as in many years past — taking back its NCAA crown.
The Trojans started the 2018 season on a high note, smothering No. 22 LMU in a shutout to open the UCLA Mini Invitational. 
The victory was headlined by junior goalie Amanda Longan, who notched seven saves to keep a clean sheet while defending 10 power play opportunities. Longan averaged 10.91 saves and 5.58 goals-against in her sophomore season, picking up 19 of those saves in the NCAA tournament. Her experience in goal will be a vital factor to the team’s success this season, especially when facing high-powered Pac-12 offenses like UCLA and Stanford.
Seven players found the net for the Trojans, with veterans and new players alike contributing to the victory. 
Senior utility player Hayley McKelvey set an aggressive offensive tone with four goals in the first period alone, and sophomore utility player Maud Megens continued the pressure, finishing with a game-high five scores. 
The offense gained two goals from senior captain driver Brianna Daboub, and sophomore drivers Denise Mammolito and Kelsey McIntosh both added to the scoring frenzy. Freshman defenders Paige Hauschild and Verica Bakoc also found the net in their debuts as Trojans, with Hauschild picking up a hat trick to finish her first collegiate outing. 
The game brought MPSF weekly honors for the team, with Megens earning Player of the Week and Hauschild receiving Newcomer of the Week following their team-leading performances. It also boded well for a team that graduated seven seniors in 2017, including All-American and leading-scorer two-meter specialist Brigitta Games. 
However, this team will return a seasoned group of upperclassmen. The roster boasts eight seniors, including All-American Daboub, who scored 36 goals as a junior captain. And this season’s roster is stocked with young talent, highlighted by Hauschild, who played alongside Games for the U.S. national team.
Each year, the NCAA final is dominated by the Pac-12, and by four teams in particular ­— USC, UCLA, Stanford and Cal. The Trojans have appeared in six Pac-12 title games, coming home victorious in three of them. This season will be no different, with Stanford earning No. 1 in the Coaches Poll, Cal following at No. 2 and USC and UCLA tying for No. 3. 
Over the past five years, a special rivalry has formed between Stanford and USC. The Trojans defeated the Cardinal for national titles in 2013 and 2016, but fell to them in the finals in 2012 and the semifinals both last year and in 2015. The Trojans have battled similarly with UCLA. The Bruins lead both the conference and the country with seven national titles, five of which came in a five season streak from 2005 to 2009.
Although the team’s season will fully kick off with the California Baptist Invitational on Jan. 27, its sights will be set on April. That month will be packed with back-to-back top-5 matchups, with the team facing Cal, Stanford and UCLA in the three weeks leading up to the MPSF championships. 
Those games will count as regular season matches, but they will serve as a preview of conference and national tournaments. 
For the Trojans, the next three months will be critical in forming a team chemistry that can withstand three top-ranked rival opponents to reclaim their spot atop the MPSF and the NCAA.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
Not too long ago, the USC football program was the Pac-12 poster child for a program in disarray, running through head coaches and scandals like it was nothing. Go through the names in the post-Pete Carroll era: Kiffin, Orgeron, Sarkisian. All of them took the job with high hopes and promise. All of them left USC on bad terms.
But now, you can make the argument that in Clay Helton, USC has its most stable head coach since Carroll. In Helton’s two full seasons at the helm, there have been no scandals, no major controversies, no spotlight shining on USC football for the wrong reasons.
Instead, it’s the other Pac-12 programs making wholesale changes. When Helton and the football team return for fall camp later this year, they will be preparing to take on a conference with vastly different leadership across the board, involving five coaching changes. In the Pac-12 South alone, three teams fired their head coaches this offseason. Out went UCLA’s Jim Mora, Arizona’s Rich Rodriguez and Arizona State’s Todd Graham. And in came Chip Kelly in Westwood, Kevin Sumlin in Tucson and Herm Edwards in Tempe. 
The Edwards hiring shouldn’t bother anyone. Who knows what the Sun Devils are doing, bringing in a 63-year-old who hasn’t coached in a decade, nor been in the college ranks since he was an assistant at San Jose State in the ’80s, and is best known for yelling, “You play to win the game” as the head coach of the New York Jets after being fed up at a reporter. In his introductory press conference, he appeared unaware of the name of the school mascot, previewing how his — probably short — tenure in Tempe will play out.
However, what might bother USC are the additions of Kelly and Sumlin to the conference — specifically, to the Pac-12 South. USC will play these teams every single season — the Trojans get both UCLA and Arizona on the road next season — and the team will have to deal with vastly better coaches than Mora and Graham ever were, both as game-callers and recruiters.
Kelly is a home-run hire for UCLA. If anyone can close the gap between UCLA and USC on the gridiron, it’s him — a flashy, well-known coach who has been a hot commodity in college football since his failed attempt at working in the NFL. Kelly worked wonders at Oregon, revolutionizing the sport with his fast-paced spread offense and developing a future NFL starting quarterback in Marcus Mariota. Not to mention his potential to lure recruits away from USC — both teams are in the same market, and it will take far less convincing for a recruit to say “yes” to Kelly than Mora. 
Sumlin, too, is a home-run hire for Arizona. He deserved a better fate than he received at Texas A&M, but he brings instant credibility to a Wildcats program that was reeling a few weeks ago following Rodriguez’s sudden dismissal. Now, Arizona has a quality coach with deep recruiting connections in Texas — and a potential Heisman candidate at quarterback in sophomore Khalil Tate.
It is obviously too early to tell if either hire will work out. Kelly caught lightning in a bottle in Oregon but couldn’t duplicate this in the NFL. Sumlin started his career at A&M with an 11-2 season, but couldn’t sustain that level of success over the next few years. 
Given all this, USC appears to be in a comfortable position. With Helton and both offensive coordinator Tee Martin and defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast returning, the Trojans know what they’re getting from their top brass.
But patience wears thin at USC. This will be Helton’s third full season at the helm. His first year was saved by a midseason quarterback switch and Sam Darnold’s hype train, which the Trojans rode to Rose Bowl glory. His second season was, well … eh. USC won many games it should have won, but by margins that were far too close for comfort, and was roasted in the Cotton Bowl by Ohio State. The loss was enough to warrant grumblings about Helton’s job security. Even following USC’s win in the Pac-12 Championship, Athletic Director Lynn Swann had to confirm minutes after the confetti flew, right there on the field at Levi’s Stadium to reporters, that he was retaining Helton next season. It seems absurd, but that’s USC in a nutshell. 
With Darnold gone and a re-tooled roster, consensus is building that next season will be Helton’s first true test as head coach. Can he quiet the doubters by winning with someone like true freshman J.T. Daniels at quarterback rather than a future NFL lottery pick? We’ll have to wait and see, but if Kelly and Sumlin succeed right away while Helton stumbles, the coaching stability at USC might not last long.

Nearly 58,000 people are homeless on any given night in Los Angeles County, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority’s 2017 data report.
As homelessness in Los Angeles reaches an all-time high, the University community, in its second year of partnership with LAHSA, has been coming together to fight the crisis. From student-run organizations to faculty-organized housing projects, the University has shown consistent dedication to solving this growing issue.
Assistant professor of social work Benjamin Henwood has been a key member in researching homelessness in Los Angeles. Henwood began a two-year study analyzing current treatments for homelessness and their levels of effectiveness.
“[Homelessness] was an intellectual interest of mine, but then actually doing the work … people who experience homelessness are in a lot of ways dehumanized,” Henwood said. “So, the impact of being able to work with people and showing them the kind of respect anyone would want and seeing what difference that made has had a big impact on me.”
Henwood said that the accelerated rate of aging for the homeless population has impacted the effectiveness of treatments. According to Henwood, homelessness results in the human body showing signs of physical aging at a quicker rate. The project intends to better address the needs of the homeless population.
“You get sicker quicker, you die quicker,” Henwood said. “The housing programs designed for this population don’t necessarily consider them an elderly population, so even though the average age is 55, [their bodies] are closer to [that of] a 75-year-old.”
In addition to conducting research, Henwood leads the Grand Challenge to End Homelessness, a program by the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare that aims to end the crisis in 10 years. 
Ending homelessness entirely, however, is not easy, but according to Henwood, students can help contribute to the initiative.
“Students can get more involved and aware of the issues by volunteering for the homeless count,” Henwood said. “That in itself doesn’t necessarily contribute to ending it, but it’s part of the process. What’s most clear is that students might want to get involved, but I think changing policies and getting more support and resources is important.”
According to Henwood, another complication with the initiative to end homelessness lies in funding.
“The funding is an issue for our initiative to better organize and develop the infrastructure we need,” Henwood said. “We don’t spend a lot of money on this and then we wonder why it’s such an issue.”
Another USC faculty member, lecturer Sofia Borges from the School of Architecture, has also demonstrated an interest in tackling the issue of homelessness by connecting her knowledge of architecture to the cause.
“It all starts and ends with shelter,” Borges said. “That’s the most fundamental human need … and especially in a place like Los Angeles [where] we have a housing shortage. As architects, we have the rare skill to be able to design shelter and house people … Housing should be a fundamental human right and … we should be at the forefront of that issue.”
This belief has led her to make USC alumni David and Mary Martin’s idea for MADWORKSHOP Homeless Studio — which delves into the architect’s role in addressing homelessness through traditional housing solutions — a reality.
Borges and USC assistant professor of practice in architecture Ronald Scott Mitchell collaborated with MADWORKSHOP, a design education foundation, to coach fourth-year students at the School of Architecture in their development of structures, which can ultimately be used as housing for the homeless.
“The studio and the students proposed not only a plausible solution for emergency stabilization housing in Los Angeles, but also that project was really city supported … and so, to have [USC] really get behind that idea, not just the terms of saying they support it but to actually put some funding toward it … [is] a good thing to do,” Borges said. 
Another initiative to address the growing homelessness issue is the Share-A-Meal Foundation located on campus. The student-run organization, which is connected to the nonprofit Khalsa Peace Corps, operates every week to help the homeless.
“What makes us unique as a charity is that we operate out of a food truck, so we’re basically a mobile kitchen, so we serve the homeless directly from there,” said Robert Stark, the head of USC Share-A-Meal.
In the past year, the University has collaborated with several organizations across Los Angeles to bring more awareness to the growing homeless population, and develop solutions to combat it.
In April 2017, USC held a summit where President C. L. Max Nikias hosted various social work groups in an effort to combat the issue. Since the summit, the initiatives USC has taken have been slowly working toward the prevention of homelessness as a whole.
“[The University community has] a moral imperative to help those in our community who are struggling just to survive,” Nikias said at the summit.

A petition has been launched by StopAntisemitism.org to condemn a USC professor for categorizing Israeli zionists as a terrorist group in a class presentation on Oct. 26, 2017. 
International relations professor David Kang said the slide was meant to discuss people who were considered terrorists by their opponents and didn’t reflect his personal opinion. Photo from Den Martinez on Flickr.
International relations professor David Kang teaches IR 210: International Relations Introductory Analysis, a mandatory course for all international relations majors and minors and a GE Category C course. In a lecture, a slide titled “Who are terrorists?” listed nine supposed terrorist groups and individuals, including the Colombian rebel group FARC, the Tamil Tigers, Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong and former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Israeli zionists were third on the list.
“The slide in question was intended to point out that national heroes of all types are called terrorists by their opponents,” Kang said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Every group listed is a hero to some people and criticized by others.”
Earlier this week, StandWithUs, a pro-Israel organization, promoted the petition on Facebook, helping it garner 7,871 signatures at the time of publication.
“By creating an equation between ‘Israeli Zionists’ and terrorist groups, Professor Kang has abused his authority — teaching a mandatory class — and has created a hostile environment for Pro-Israel and Jewish students at USC,” StandWithUs said in its Facebook post. The post has been shared almost 400 times and has received hundreds of comments. 
The petition calls upon President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick, in addition to the rest of the USC community, to explicitly condemn Kang. 
“We would like USC to speak out against the bigotry Professor Kang expressed and take concrete steps to ensure that anti-Israel sentiments and other forms of bigotry do not have a home on campus,” the petition said. 
In response to the petition circulating social media, Kang has been working with the Rabbi of Chabad and the Executive Director of Hillel on an official statement to be published in the next few days.
“There are real racists out there,” Kang said. “To be attacked by ‘friendly fire’ is really missing the target. I find it surreal that I am being attacked for something I didn’t say and don’t believe.”
According to Quick, the core principles of any university include upholding academic freedom, and statements made by faculty members are not endorsed by the University.
“Indeed, we sometimes profoundly disagree with those statements,” Quick said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Nevertheless, we protect and support their right to express those views. We also support everyone’s right to sign on to any petition they wish, but such expressions and calls for censorship will not be used by the University to influence a faculty member’s scholarly pursuits.”
Just because you have state sanctioned military uniforms and weapons given to you by the U.S. does not mean that you are the good guys.
For every Israeli that dies in the conflict, 33 Palestinians die. You tell me who is doing all the killing.
So by that logic, the Netherlands was the aggressor against the Germans in World War 2, since only 200,000 Dutch died compared to 7 million Germans.
The Muslims who commit suicide bombings.
These are not “scholarly pursuits” that are being discussed by Prof. Kang in the classroom, so the statement by the Provost is misplaced. Freedom of expression is not protected from accountability at a private university. This rhetoric, with the intended  loss of meaningful distinction of what is terrorism, appropriate defense, or “….another person’s freedom fighter”  are points of view that the university should not support nor condone; and not “sometimes”, but always. .
Some people (not me) think that Black Lives Matter is a terrorist group.  Imagine the outrage if Professor Kang used BLM to make the same point he did about Israeli Zionists.

Flying across the horizons of African and Asian forests, drones created through a collaboration between the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society and Microsoft operate with the intent of spotting poaching hunters.

According to USC computer science professor Milind Tambe, poaching around the world is not easily detectable, but with recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology, wildlife conservation efforts are improving.
USC CAIS announced that it is initiating a new collaboration with Microsoft in AI for Earth, a program intended to encourage AI wildlife conservation research and provide student internships, on Jan. 8. 
USC CAIS was founded in August 2016 by Tambe and Eric Rice, an associate professor of social work. According to Tambe, Microsoft and USC CAIS established research relations in the past for several years, and the collaboration has now escalated into a partnership. 
“What this partnership implies is that we have essentially supported summer research, so other researchers can participate on the conservation research that we have been doing here,” Tambe said. “So we are applying for summer fellowships for Ph.D. students, [postdoctoral students], assistant professors and there are postdoctoral research opportunities.”
The Microsoft Green Blog stated that USC CAIS has done extensive collaboration with Microsoft on multiple environmental AI projects. Past projects included game theory research, machine learning and AI development to better wildlife conditions.
One of the major focuses of this joint wildlife conservation effort involves poaching prevention. USC CAIS and Microsoft have expanded their AI implementations beyond local areas and into Africa and Asia. 
According to Tambe, SPOT, otherwise known as the Systematic Poacher Detector is one of many collaborations. This project flies video-taking drones in Africa to detect poaching activities in forests. These drones demonstrate the benefits of AI machines, since they use automatic detection instead of manual labor. 
“We can let appropriate authorities know that there are some people walking in the forest, who are not supposed to be there,” Tambe said. “That would allow us to intercept the poachers and stop them from getting into the park and hunting animals.”
The Microsoft Green Blog also expressed interest in supporting early career research, building and maintaining canonical environmental datasets and translating findings to daily applications with USC researchers. 
Given that there is a high level of student interest in AI environmental conservation, CAIS aims to be more present at USC by publicizing the collaboration with Microsoft. 
CAIS plans to host more on-campus seminars for students with lectures given by speakers from Microsoft. Additionally, directors of the organization intend to visit Microsoft with students to conduct research firsthand. 
“Our students are so keen on this topic that we haven’t had an issue on trying to recruit people to do this work … [but] many students don’t know that this is going on,” Tambe said.

A new USC study published on Jan. 16 found that doctor’s offices, rather than emergency rooms, prescribed the most opioids to patients.
According to the study conducted by USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics and the Keck School of Medicine, opioid prescriptions have exploded in the United States, increasing by nearly 471 percent from 1996 to 2012.
While many regulations have been focused on restricting emergency room prescriptions, the share of opioids prescribed in emergency rooms during the 17-year study period decreased from 7.4 percent to 4.4 percent. 
“One hypothesis has been that the emergency room is a recurrent site of care and that patients could be going from ER to ER to obtain multiple prescriptions to support their addiction,” USC Keck assistant professor Sarah Axeen said in a press release. “But our analysis shows that emergency rooms account for a very small share of all prescribed opioids. In fact, doctor’s offices are the source of many more of these drugs.”
Out of the four settings where opioids are prescribed — including the ER, doctors’ offices, dental offices and outpatient sites — doctors’ offices were the only setting in which opioid prescriptions increased. In 1996, they prescribed 70.6 percent of all opioids in the United States and by 2012, that number had jumped to 83.45 percent. 
“From the 1990s to at least 2013, we had convinced ourselves that prescribing opioids was a fine thing to do [for chronic pain],” Keck associate professor Michael Menchine said in a press release. “It is hard to look in the mirror years later and say two million people might be dependent on opioids because of this sort of practice.”
Opioids have been declared an epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
In 2016, a record of over 42,000 Americans overdosed on prescriptions, and opioid prescriptions were involved in at least 40 percent of these deaths. 
According to Keck professor Seth Seabury, in the push to address this epidemic, policymakers must focus on targeting the source of the problem. Policies to restrict opioid prescriptions in the ER, however, may have limited effects.
“We are not saying these policies are bad,” Seabury said in a press release. “What our findings suggest is that they should really be focusing these policies on other places in the system.”
Menchine encourages a more holistic approach to the opioid epidemic, including treatment for substance abuse over prescription regulations.
“I want to be there for my patients and if they have substance abuse problems, I want to be able to address it in the best way I can,” Menchine said in a press release. “Too often, people think the solution is to simply say we can no longer prescribe opioids. For me, the solution is to say: It looks to me like you have a problem with opioid addiction and here are the options available so you can address it.”
