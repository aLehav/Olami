Dr. Governator · Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers the main address at the 126th annual commencement ceremony at USC Friday. The governor was awarded an honorary USC degree by President Steven B. Sample before giving his speech. - Brandon Hui | Summer Trojan
More than 8,000 graduates were honored Friday as USC marked its 126th annual commencement ceremony with an address from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who shared “six rules of success” with the new alumni.
President Steven B. Sample honored the movie star with an honorary degree from the university before his speech.
“Wow, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Doctor of Humane Letters,” Schwarzenegger said. “I love it. But, of course, I noticed that it wasn’t a doctorate in film or in cinema or in acting. I wonder why?”
Schwarzenegger poked fun at his acting throughout his speech, offering graduates advice based on his own experience as a bodybuilder and actor.
“Red Sonja, Hercules in New York, Last Action Hero…those movies went in the toilet. But that’s OK, because at the same time I made movies like Terminator and Conan and True Lies and Predator and Twins that went through the roof,” he said. “So you can’t always win, but don’t be afraid of making decisions. You can’t be paralyzed by fear of failure or you will never push yourself.”
The governor also shared what he called “Dr. Schwarzenegger’s Six Rules of Success,” with graduates — telling them to trust themselves, break rules, not be afraid to fail, not to listen to “naysayers,” give back and, most importantly, “work like hell.”
“There are 24 hours a day. You sleep six hours and have 18 hours left,” Schwarzenegger said. “Now, I know there are some of you out there that say well, wait a minute, I sleep eight hours or nine hours. Well then, just sleep faster, I would recommend.”
Hard work would be especially important in the near future, Schwarzenegger said.
“We are in tough times now and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world,” he said. “But there is one thing certain: We’ll be back. And we will be back stronger and more prosperous than ever before because that is what California and America have always done.”
Sample also acknowledged the insecurity many graduates feel because of the economic downturn.
“It’s true that you’re graduating in an uncertain economy,” Sample said. “But I would encourage you to be positive, innovative and courageous. The world needs your ideas, your enthusiasm and your talent — it also needs your kindness, your curiosity and your desire to live a full and meaningful life.”
Sample then referred to posthumous salutatorian William Zarifi, a senior majoring in business administration and manager of the USC basketball team who died of cancer in October.
“He lived a thoughtful and ethical life, a life in which his determination, his compassion and his respect for others earned him the admiration of all who knew him and loved him,” Sample said.
Brenda Nuyen, a USC Renaissance Scholar who majored in biological sciences, and Sara Schlievert, a USC Trustee Scholar and National Merit Scholar who majored in music, were the two other salutatorians honored at the ceremony.
Professor Anito Jones, journalist Elena Poniatowska and social worker Frances Wu also received honorary degrees from USC.
Overall, graduates said they enjoyed both the ceremony and the governor’s remarks.
“I was just happy he said ‘I’ll be back,’” said Megha Mehta, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences. “[It was] pretty entertaining.”
Emily Yu, who graduated with bachelor’s degrees in fine arts and East Asian languages and cultures, said she was surprised by Schwarzenegger’s humor.
“[The ceremony was] pretty interesting and a lot more humorous than I expected,” she said. “[Schwarzenegger] made fun of himself. He gave the students what they wanted to hear.”

Poison Pit -“Manners”
After the success of its 2008 EP “Chunk of Change,” New England-based electro-pop group Passion Pit banked on its blogosphere buzz to quickly put together its first full-length album.
The result, titled “Manners,” builds upon the unique musical qualities lead singer Michael Angelakos infused into the “Change” EP he initially recorded as a gift to his girlfriend. “Manners” overflows with glittery synth-lines and sequenced percussion reminiscent of the cocaine-driven dance-funk of the 1980s. 
While Passion Pit’s addictingly upbeat instrumentation lends distinction to “Manners,” which many modern pop groups are unable to achieve, the songs are tainted by Angelakos’ ear-splitting vocals — which rest somewhere between a drunken karaoke falsetto and the screeches emitted by alley cats in heat.
While on “Change” Angelakos found a happy medium between subdued singing and full-on wailing, he seems to have forgotten the old saying ‘less is more’ on the band’s newest endeavor, as his whines render nearly all songs on “Manners” practically unlistenable. To make matters worse, on a handful of tracks, including “Little Secrets” and “The Reeling,” Angelakos’ vocals are often doubled against one another — there’s no escaping his bone-shattering cries.
Mentally removing Angelakos’ voice from the album reveals a collection of ingenious pop instrumentals; Passion Pit might hold the key to the new era of electronica, if only it found a new lead singer. However, since the band is of Angelakos’ own design, perhaps it would be wise for him to invest in some singing lessons.
GRADE: C-



To celebrate the band’s reentry into the pop scene, The Vaseline’s old label — famed indie heavy-hitters Sub Pop—released a re-mastered and repackaged version of the 1992 compilation “The Way of the Vaselines,” now titled “Enter the Vaselines.”  Encompassing each of the band’s releases — including its sole LP, “Dum-Dum” — “Enter the Vaselines” creates a fitting retrospective for the band that paved the way for famous Scottish pop acts such as Belle and Sebastian. 
While a majority of The Vaselines’ songs touch upon unsavory subjects ranging from incompetent lovers (“You Think You’re a Man”) to kinky sex (“Rory Rides Me Raw”), the band juxtaposes these unlikely topics with a unique brand of upbeat, jangly pop; Frances McKee’s soft and flighty vocals provide the perfect vehicle for delivering lines such as I’m a real bitch / I’m a twisted witch (“Bitch”) and Eugene Kelly’s teenage-esque wail adds double-doses of energy to the band’s extremely upbeat numbers.
As it functions as a complete retrospective, “Enter the Vaselines” adds previously unreleased demos and live tracks into the two-disc collection; while most of these bonus tracks are of low quality and not as captivating as the band’s proper catalogue, fans of the band will delight in discovering how McKee and Kelly developed their musical ideas over such a short, yet influential, career.
Green Day – “21st Century Breakdown”
Nearly 22 years after their formation, it seems rather unbelievable that iconic Bay Area punks Green Day still manage to tour and record amidst the struggles brought on by middle age. However, the members of Green Day have ventured back into the music world, delivering their follow up to 2004’s “American Idiot,” titled “21st Century Breakdown.”
Much like “American Idiot,” “21st Century Breakdown” is a punk-rock opera following two young lovers through the hardships of living in the post-millennial age. After the success of “American Idiot,” it is hard to accept “21st Century Breakdown” as a self-sustaining idea; it seems Green Day has discovered a formula for surefire success with the rock opera revival, and plans to draw out the trend as long as humanly possible.
Green Day delivers nothing new with “21st Century Breakdown,” as the quasi-political messages contained within the lyrics seem stale and clichéd in a post-Bush administration world and the instrumentation reveals no artistic growth, supporting claims that the band has lived inside a musical stalemate since 2000’s “The Warning.” Billy Joe Armstrong’s barking vocals on “Know Your Enemy” recalls “Minority” off “The Warning,” while more subdued numbers such as “Before the Lobotomy” parallel the band’s hit “Wake Me Up When September Ends.”
Yet for what Green Day does, they do quite well. While the band’s initial fan base may have grown up and ventured away from the world of pop-punk, “21st Century Breakdown” will undoubtedly shepherd new legions of Hot Topic-loving middle schoolers into the Green Day lexicon—and if a sub-par album leads a 12 year-old to download Green Day’s classic 1994 album “Dookie,” who are we to complain?

Peace offering · Masahiro Motoki (left) and Ryoko Hirosue (right) star as husband and wife in Yojiro Takita’s “Departures,” a contemplative drama that examines the lives of nokanshi, the preparers of corpses.
Two handsomely dressed men, one old, the other young, drive through curtains of falling snow. They’re en route to a funeral, whereupon their services as nokanshi will be utilized by the family of a dead girl. The old man is stoic, while the younger one is stricken, his taut face displaying unveiled terror; he might as well be storming Omaha Beach, not dressing up a corpse.
Yojiro Takita’s “Departures,” which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film last February, pulls no punches in illustrating the work of a nokanshi, the preparer of dead bodies. Americans might be comfortable with leaving the task of corpse preparation in an undertaker’s basement, but in Japan, the process gets a large familial audience. The graceful cleansing of the face, application of makeup and shrouding by sheet are laid bare for all to see. It is a strangely beautiful sight.
Still, it is clear that Daigo (Masahiro Motoki), the youthful protagonist of “Departures,” is unnerved by his newfound profession. A former cellist who was left unemployed after the termination of his Tokyo orchestra, Daigo returns to his hometown in the northern countryside accompanied by his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue). Looking for work, he notices a promising job listing in the paper for what he believes is a travel agency.
In a way, Daigo’s first impression of the job is accurate. However, it soon becomes clear after his interview with Ikuei (Tsutomu Yamazaki), the aging proprietor of a funeral home, that Daigo will not be sending clients to Oahu. Within days of accepting the position, Daigo finds himself with Ikuei in a roach infested apartment, removing the rotting body of an elderly woman. Understandably, he does not tell Mika how his day went.
The looming question in the heart of “Departures” is how somebody who makes a living by handling corpses finds solace and worth in their occupation. While the process might bring peace to the families of the deceased, others, including some of Daigo’s childhood acquaintances and his own wife, view it with utter repugnance.
Takita takes great pains in using Daigo’s troubling profession as a means of revealing the poor man’s painful history, which includes the death of his mother at a young age, and a father who walked out on the family even earlier. While these revelations give us a more intimate glimpse at Daigo’s vulnerabilities, they push the movie into an uncomfortably long running time, and eventually start to feel glaringly plotted.
What makes “Departures” more enjoyable is its lurking sense of humor, which rears its head in unexpected ways. Take, for instance, a scene where Ikuei enlists the newly hired Daigo to play a corpse in a how-to video for aspiring nokanshi. Bristling under Ikuei’s not-so-carefully applied straight razor, Daigo appears as hysterically helpless as Jeff Daniels did while full of laxatives in “Dumb & Dumber,” and the film resists falling to the suicidal dearth of self-seriousness.
It certainly helps that Motoki is terrifically convincing as Daigo. Spritely in appearance and output, Motoki’s face holds nothing back in communicating anxieties, frustrations, hopes and pleasures. His performance is an excellent counterpart to Yamazaki’s warm but vacant Ikuei, who seems to have been whittled down to his current form by the same sights and processes that nauseate Daigo.
Watching Daigo’s passage into acceptance as a nokanshi is both painful and intriguing. It’s tempting, perhaps naturally, to hope that Daigo might find a means of overcoming his situation and moving onward professionally. The more challenging and interesting idea is that Daigo may be proud of his work as a nokanshi, despite the societal taboos attached to it.
Unfortunately, Takita himself seems to be thinking along the lines of the former, as suggested by several labored montages of Daigo practicing cello against the mountains to Joe Hisashi’s lovely score. “Departures” builds itself up for a climactic shift, yet that shift never quite comes. The film’s ending is satisfying for its lack of a predictable cop-out, yet somehow ends up feeling confused in its resolution.
American audiences will likely be moved by the thin personal stories of “Departures,” as well as its unyielding look into a little known aspect of Japanese culture. Takita’s film is certainly a curious, disarming picture, but it also is overstuffed with undeveloped ideas, even with its excessive length of two hours and 10 minutes. It’s as interesting as any museum exhibit and funny at times, but one cannot help but come out feeling as cold and bloated as, well, a corpse.

The No. 3 USC men’s golf team, playing without the injured Jamie Lovemark and on the brink of having a promising season end prematurely, shot a final round four-under par 284 to grab the last NCAA national championship qualification spot by one shot over New Mexico. The Trojans were led by freshman Steve Lim, whose last day 66 was deemed “hands down, the best round of the year” by coach Chris Zambri.  
Lovemark, a two-time All-American, sustained a muscle tear in his rib section two weeks ago during practice and was clearly not his usual self in the first two rounds of the NCAA West Regional at Lake Merced Golf Course, shooting 76 and 83. He withdrew from the tournament before Saturday’s final round, meaning that all four of USC’s other golfers would have their scores count, severely limiting the Trojans’ room for error. 
“The safety net [of the fifth player] makes it a lot easier,” sophomore Matt Giles said. “It’s difficult playing with only four guys.”
The Trojans got off to a rough start, with senior Tom Glissmeyer six-over par after his first five holes and no other player under par at the time. 
“Even though I was struggling early on, I knew that I needed to grind it out,” Glissmeyer said. “Every stroke could be the difference and it turned out it was, one stroke.”
Glissmeyer settled down and was one-under par on his remaining 12 holes, finishing with a 77. Giles had two birdies in his last five holes to shoot 72, while sophomore Tim Sluiter birdied four of his last seven holes to shoot 69. 
Lim, the only non All-American regular starter for USC, was the unexpected source of the low round on Saturday, making six birdies and an eagle over his last 13 holes.  
“He’s been a great addition to our team all year,” Zambri said. “The only thing he hadn’t been doing was finishing off good rounds that he had started. On Saturday, our assistant coach [Josh] Brewer walked the course with him the whole time and just kind of talked him through every shot because the decision making can be tough when [you’re under pressure].” 
The decision to have Brewer basically caddy for the freshman proved huge down the stretch when Lim shook off a bogey on an easy 16th hole to finish birdie-birdie and help USC qualify for the NCAA finals to be held at Inverness Country Club in Toledo, Ohio. 
The focus for the Trojans now turns to fine tuning their games and waiting to see if Lovemark will be healthy enough to play in less than two weeks. 
Even without Lovemark, the Trojans believe they have as good of a chance as anyone at taking home the national title. 
“Every guy on our team, of the four that are going for sure, has proven that they can play big time golf on a big stage,” Zambri said. 
 “Everything else was just preparation,” Glissmeyer added. “I don’t really care if we went the whole season without winning if we get this next one. That’s all that matters.”

Stunned and eliminated by No. 32 Washington last weekend in the second round of  the NCAA tournament, the No. 7 Women of Troy’s dreams of a team championship will remain just that — a dream. 
Three individual players, however, will advance to College Station, Texas, in hopes of bringing home a singles championship.  
The loss to Washington was a heartbreaker to say the least. The Huskies leapt out to an early lead in doubles and despite several comeback efforts by the Women of Troy, the deficit proved too large to overcome and the Huskies took the doubles point. 
Singles was a similar story, with the Huskies taking an early advantage over the Women of Troy. Again, several comeback efforts brought the Women of Troy to a 3-3 draw with Washington, but the Huskies outlasted them, capturing the final singles match and the 4-3 victory. 
“Obviously they are not a pushover team,” said senior Amanda Fink. “I’m just grateful I’ve gotten to be a part of a lot of really special things this year.” 
The elimination from team play had one benefit for the senior.
“Being eliminated meant I got to go to graduation so it was sort if bittersweet,” Fink said.
Despite the disappointment in team play, Fink, sophomore Maria Sanchez and junior Sarah Fansler will all try their hands at the singles crown this week. 
The tournament will begin on Wednesday with a field of 64 players Ranked among the top in the nation, an NCAA championship is not a far cry for any of the three players representing USC. 
Fink, who sits the highest in the rankings at No. 22, is the lone senior and veteran of the program. Fink enters the tournament with an impressive résumé and a series of accolades. 
Most recently she earned regional honors as Intercollegiate Tennis Association Senior Player of the Year. Just more than a week before that she received her third All-Pac-10 First Team selection. 
Fink, who is 35-7 this season, has also received Pac-10 Player of the Week honors this season and is on a 24-match winning streak entering the tournament. Fink made it to the quarterfinals last year before being eliminated. 
For Fink, maintaining her physical well-being throughout the tournament is of most importance.
“Basically rest and liquid are key,” she said. 
Sanchez sits right behind Fink in the rankings at No. 23. Despite battling injury for much of the season, Sanchez has enjoyed much success of her own, including key upsets for the Women of Troy. 
“I just have to go out there and grind out every match, even if I’m not playing my best tennis that day,” Sanchez said.
She has earned Pac-10 Player of the Week honors and her first career Pac-10 selection landing a spot on the All-Pac-10 Second Team. Sanchez is 24-10 overall entering the tournament. 
When asked if there was any player in particular she would like to face off with in the tournament, Sanchez simply answered, “I want to play the number one seed, whoever that is.” 
The final USC competitor, Fansler, comes in ranked at No. 42. Like Fink and Sanchez, Fansler has also picked up a Pac-10 Player of the Week honor this season. She enters the tournament with a 21-13 record and is riding a three-match winning streak.  
This time around, all three Women of Troy are looking for success regardless of who they play in the first round — brackets for the singles tournament have not yet been released.
As far as a team championship, Fink is confident the team she is leaving behind can find success in the future. 
“We had one of the best teams I’ve ever seen here, but we live and we learn and hopefully the girls next year can learn from the experience,” she said.

Cashing in? · A former member of Mayo’s inner-circle says Floyd paid a Mayo confidant $1,000 - Joel Zink | Summer Trojan
If found to be true by the NCAA, the alleged incident would constitute a major violation and could have repercussions for the university in various forms of sanctions.
USC’s basketball and football programs are already under NCAA investigation for allegations stemming from Mayo and former football player Reggie Bush. Last May, Johnson claimed that Rodney Guillory gave Mayo about $30,000 in improper benefits. A former sportswriter, Johnson was once a close confidant of Mayo’s but had a falling out with the player and subsequently came forward with the alleged violations, appearing on ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” to break the story.
Officials from USC have declined comment since the story broke.
“As you know, USC can’t comment on any issue that’s the subject of an ongoing NCAA and Pac-10 investigation,” USC general counsel Carol Mauch Amir told Yahoo! Sports.
The latest allegation claims that three months after Mayo had committed to play at USC, Guillory and Johnson met Floyd in Beverly Hills, Calif., before preparing to go to Las Vegas for the NBA’s All-Star Weekend. After Johnson circled the block while Floyd and Guillory met for 15 minutes, Guillory returned to the car with an envelope that showed multiple $100 dollar bills inside and “had ‘substantially’ more than $1,000,” according to the initial report by Yahoo! Sports.
The information about the alleged payment from Guillory to Floyd was not included in Johnson’s interview with “Outside the Lines.”
According to multiple reports, Guillory is under federal investigation for some of his financial dealings tied to Mayo. Guillory also has a history with the NCAA after being found to have given extra benefits to former USC basketball player Jeff Trepagnier and former Fresno State basketball player Tito Maddox.

Blazing speed · Ahmad Rashad won the 100-meter (10.13 seconds) and the 200-meter (20.82), while finishing second in the sprint relay. - Dieuwertje Kast | Summer Trojan
After a rough and windy start, USC’s track and field team managed to pull it together and leave the two-day Pac-10 Championship at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., with five Pac-10 titles, a men’s second place overall win with 117 points and a women’s fourth place ranking with 108 points. 
The team could not, however, muster up enough points to beat the home team, University of Oregon, who took first place in both men’s and women’s competition for the first time in the school’s history.
“This was a very competitive conference,” coach Ron Allice said. “Anytime you score over 100 points in the Pac-10, which is the most balanced conference in the NCAA, normally you would win. 
“In a lot of cases we would have won this conference with these point totals, but it’s significantly different on your home turf. In a neutral site [Oregon] would not have been that dominant.”
The first day of competition proved to be a difficult one for the Trojans in terms of getting those much-needed points, but the most unexpected loss was during the javelin competition. USC senior Corey White, who previously held the Pac-10 title, was out-thrown by the Duck’s Cyrus Hostetler’s 250-05 throw by five feet. 
“[White and Hostetler] had the two best throws in America, both collegic and non-collegic,” Allice said. “The series that White put together was unmatched compared to his competitor. The difference is that Corey’s height pattern is much more vertical than [Hostetler’s] and when you’re throwing into a headwind like we were this weekend, it becomes a disadvantage. Without that you would see that Corey is the better javelin thrower and that will reflect in the NCAA.”
Junior Ahmad Rashad dominated the short-distance races, where he took the titles for the 100-meter in 10.13 and 200-meter in 20.82, and was second in the sprint relay. Sophomore Oscar Spurlock also nabbed a title in the 110 high hurdles in 13.56, along with senior Eva Orban in the women’s hammer in 67.39, and the men’s 4×100-meter relay in 3:06.30. 
Senior triple jump Aven Wright shared the sentiments of Allice about the aftermath of this weekend. 
“As a team we competed well. Everyone, I feel, scored as they were supposed to. Getting over 100 points is always a big deal, and everyone gave one hundred percent,” Wright said. “Oregon was able to have a lot of people in every event, especially in the long distance running, and that really gave them an advantage as far as points were concerned.” 
Wright felt the team members as a whole needed to work on consistency with its approach in their respective competitions. He and Allice repeated the message that the team, though young, seems to be at its peak; it just need to focus on staying there.
“I would take nothing away from their performance,” said Allice. “They performed above and beyond what we could have asked for. Orban really showed up in her hammer and had a heck of a meet.”
The women’s team proved itself in this championship, Allice said — so much so that even though they finished fourth, Allice believes that without some minute technicalities, they could have easily taken third or a close second.  
In reality, the whole team is  young. The only athletes not returning next year are seniors White and Wright, so the Trojans have a lot of room to grow by next season. 
This season, though, is hardly over. 
With the NCAA finals, regionals and the U.S. championships still on the calendar, the team’s solid showing in the Pac-10 championship shows that this youthful team may be ready to meet the challenges ahead of them.
Allice pointed to the dual meet against UCLA as a possible turning point of the season. 
“That [dual meet] that brought the gauntlet back to USC really helped us,” Allice said. “It just shows that same correlation with how competing at your own facility and having that support-base certainly gives a team an up. Prospects next year will be greater. 
“We’ll be a handful for this [division] next year. I’d say we should definitely reach top 10 in the country, if not top 5, in the next couple weeks.”

“Come on down!”
Audience members strain to hear these words in anticipation of being chosen to compete on “The Price Is Right.” When Tyler Mains first heard what he thought might be his name, he wasn’t sure how to react — or even if it was his name that had been called.
“When you go into the show you have no idea that you are going to be called. It’s so loud that it’s hard to hear the announcer,” Mains said. “I thought I might have heard my name, but I wasn’t sure. Then they held up cue cards and I saw my name written on one, but I didn’t hear them say, ‘Come on down!’”
Mains, a former resident adviser for the sixth floor of Birnkrant who graduated with a degree in biological sciences from USC Friday, attended the game show on May 4 because “it was a childhood dream.”
While waiting in a line outside of the studio for about four hours, Mains and the group of 18 other students he was with sang the USC fight song and other cheers to get the attention of the producers that were walking down the line talking to people, looking for dynamic contestants.
“We each filled out a card that asked us about ourselves and why we wanted to be on ‘The Price is Right,’” Mains said. “Then they interviewed the entire audience in groups of about 15 to 20 — the [interviewing] process took about six hours.”
During the 10-hour process, Mains said he remained very enthusiastic.
“I was very excited and yelled and clapped a lot,” he said.
The long wait and exuberant cheers paid off — Mains was selected to be one of nine contestants on the game show.
“When I saw my name I stood up, screamed and went down,” he said.
At the contestant’s row, Mains — who was the first contestant to be called — won the second round of bids by guessing closest to the price of the luggage shown. From this win, Mains played the game “Easy as 1, 2, 3” where he was shown a set of women’s and men’s fragrances, a number of small kitchen appliances and a set of golf clubs and asked to rank them in order of cost. Mains successfully did so, winning the game.
Mains then progressed to the Showcase Showdown, where he was the third contestant to spin the wheel in an attempt to get as close to $1 without exceeding that value in two spins. The first contestant spun twice for a total of 45 cents, the second spun twice for a total of $1.05 and Mains spun once for a total of 95 cents, making him the winner of the Showcase Showdown.
From winning the Showcase Showdown, Mains automatically was one of the two competitors in the showcase at the end of the show, where he attempted to guess the price of a group of prizes. Mains decided to pass on the first showcase, which included swimwear, skiwear and a trip to Fiji and Iceland.
Mains’ showcase included a refrigerator, stove and oven, dishwasher, Dell laptop and Chevrolet Cobalt. Mains bid $25,000 for this prize package — only $399 off from the actual price — and won.
Mains — who said he watched The Price is Right every day during the summer and when he was home from school when he was younger — attributed his success on the show to chance.
“Before the show we were looking up prices of different things on an iPhone. I looked to my friends in the audience for help, but everyone was yelling numbers so it was hard to get a sense of what to do,” Mains said. “A lot of my success I think was luck.”
Cayla Cocanour, a freshman majoring in comparative literature who lived in Mains’ dorm, also attended the show.
“There’s no one who deserves to win all this stuff more than Tyler,” she said. “We were all so happy for him.”
Ilana Broad, a freshman majoring in music industry who lived on Mains’ floor and also attended the show, said the experience was one she would not forget.
“The whole thing was a blur,” she said. “The best part was when Tyler won the showcase and we all stormed the stage.”

Saving grace · Senior Danny Cooper stepped in to preserve a Trojan victory Sunday, but it probably won’t be enough to spring the Trojans into the post season. - Brandon Hui | Summer Trojan
It was Senior Day on Sunday at Dedeaux Field.
How fitting it was, then, that one of USC’s two seniors, righthanded reliever Danny Cooper, picked up the save with a superb performance.
After junior Brad Boxberger went six strong innings but exited with just a 3-2 lead, Cooper came in and shut the door, holding visiting Stanford scoreless for three innings. By the time Cooper recorded the last out — a pinch-hit groundout — the Trojans had managed two more runs and secured a 5-2 victory over the Cardinal (29-22, 12-12 Pac-10).
It was the first win of the three-game set for a reeling USC team that had lost 11 of its last 13. The spell dropped the Trojans from NCAA Regional hopefuls to unlikely postseason competitors.

“We had a huge monkey on our back,” said junior shortstop Grant Green. “We’ve lost our last nine weekend games, so we came out here and played a good game and kind of got that monkey off our back.”
It didn’t come easy though, as in the ninth inning with Stanford’s Brent Milleville on first base. Cardinal designated hitter Jeff Whitlow hit a grounder to Green at shortstop, who turned and started what appeared to be a game-ending double play. However, sophomore second baseman Joe De Pinto dropped Green’s toss to eliminate any chance of turning two and seemingly make Milleville safe at second. Yet, first base umpire Steve Mattingly ruled the runner out, and despite a spirited protest from Stanford head coach Mark Marquess, Mattingly didn’t budge.
“From what I could tell it did look like he might have bobbled it a little bit,” said redshirt freshman righthander Andrew Triggs, who was warming up in the bullpen at the time. “It definitely came down on our side, especially [considering it was] in the ninth inning.”
The Trojans opened the game with a manufactured run, as leadoff hitter Mike O’Neill singled and came around on a sacrifice bunt, an infield hit and an RBI knock into left field by freshman Ricky Oropesa.
From there, Stanford starter Michael Marshall held the USC offense in check, but the Trojans broke through for two more runs in the fifth. After a Billy Pinkerton RBI single in the sixth, Green capped the scoring with a solo home run in the seventh inning.
USC’s Boxberger struck out the first five Stanford hitters he faced on his way to retiring the first nine hitters in order.
“He definitely got off to a super strong start and it was exactly what we needed, especially after Friday and Saturday,” said redshirt freshman righthander Andrew Triggs. “It was really good to have someone be the stopper because you never like to have someone take three from you on your own field.”
Friday and Saturday weren’t pretty, as the Trojans were outscored 17-7 in the two losses with a restructured pitching staff. Boxberger, the usual Friday starter, had his scheduled start pushed back to Sunday because of a lingering illness, so lefthander Anthony Vasquez, the other senior on the roster, started the game instead.
Vasquez lasted eight innings but suffered from a Stanford offensive outburst, giving up all six of his runs in the third. He gave up five singles and a double but didn’t help his own cause, committing two errors — one fielding, one throwing — and hitting a batter, before coming out of the game down 6-2. 
The Trojans rallied for four runs in the bottom of the ninth on a Vasquez grand slam, but reliever Ryan Cabral gave up two more in the top half of the inning and USC fell 8-6.
Saturday, junior righthander Robert Stock didn’t fare much better, tossing only four innings and giving up six runs in what amounted to his worst start of the season.
Stanford lefthander Brett Mooneyham shut down the USC offense, striking out 11 Trojans and allowing only one run in a complete game seven-hitter.
With postseason contention not mathematically impossible but certainly unexpected, USC (25-27, 11-13) will now travel to Cal for a weekend series that will likely conclude the Trojans’ season. Stock and Boxberger will start the Friday and Saturday games, respectively, and Vasquez will make his final collegiate start Sunday.

Habitats ·  Beit T’Shuvah (above) and Wertz Brothers Inc. - Hilary Lazarus | Summer Trojan
So you just moved into your new digs for the summer and realized that you don’t have a scrap of furniture — not to fret! Take a trek to the coast, and these venues are sure to supply you with enough wares to fill a living space without breaking the bank. You might even have enough cash left over to explore the clothing boutiques, get a tattoo on the Venice Beach boardwalk or splurge on fine dining at that new restaurant around the corner.
Goodwill
1803 Lincoln Blvd., #8
Santa Monica, Calif.
It’s no secret that thrift stores are often home to used furniture at rock-bottom prices, and this Goodwill — just four blocks from Third Street Promenade — is no exception. Plopped across the street from trendy home boutiques sure to induce sticker shock, the donation center and store benefits the community while benefiting from its affluent donors, offering fewer pieces that feel like the worst hits of the ’80s than the average Goodwill branch. There are no guarantees when shopping second-hand, but it’s safe to say that a few side tables, wardrobes and couches will be there to peruse. Arrive early, or the 40-somethings will have already swept in and snatched up the sweetest deals.
Best finds: Victorian-style wooden table clock, $19.99; all glassware, 99 cents.
King’s Furniture
11961 Santa Monica Blvd.
Los Angeles
Sharing a parking lot with the new Chase bank next-door, the unassuming King’s stocks a generous number of factory-direct items, all neatly organized for browsing. Considering the prices mostly beat those at Ikea, the quality is surprisingly good; wooden bed frames are sure to last years, and none of the varnishes or stains look messy or cheap. Simple silhouettes and lightweight but real wooden furniture dominates the store landscape, dotted here and there with suede couches and glass-top tables. The showroom is complete with a (navigable) mountain of occasional and bedside tables starting at less than $50 each in the back corner.
Best finds: oak kitchen table with four chairs, $299; suede loveseat in numerous color choices, $350.
Council Thrift Shop
11801 Santa Monica Blvd.
Los Angeles
Disparate from its Goodwill and Salvation Army cousins, this thrift store has all the makings for a shopping haunt. Dark walls covered in art and Motown music greet customers upon entering, and the inexpensive yet classy furnishing section is sure to appease any budget. Two mint-condition Hollywood Regency chairs with walnut frames and raised floral brocade for only $85 each are a good indicator of what’s in store; everything looks like it’s straight out of a glamorous 1950s film. It’s worth browsing outside the home section a bit, too — where else carries vintage Prada purses for $20?
Best finds: wood curio tower, $95; expansive wooden-frame citron couch, $265.
Caprices Furniture Rugs & More
4300 Overland Ave.
Culver City, Calif.
This little hideaway houses things to sleep on, things to sit on, things to eat on and things to store stuff in with costs that won’t set back most college shoppers. Much like King’s, Caprice has furniture made of materials that weren’t (for the most part) produced in laboratories, in chic styles and scales ideal for apartment living. Almost any dining set desired is less than $500, and no searching is required for a legitimate bargain. The store itself is a little sterile, but the steals inside make up for the lack of ambiance. The store displays only a fraction of the products offered online, so remember to check out the website at www.capricefurniture.com.
Best finds: faux leather-suede combination loveseat and chaise with checkered pillows, $399; wood table and four chairs with faux-suede upholstery, $228.
Beit T’Shuvah Thrift Store
10409 Washington Blvd.
Culver City, Calif.
Like an iteration of Council geared toward an older crowd, Beit T’Shuvah has that just-raided-grandma’s-living-room feel that so many thrift shops have with the distinction that every item is in impeccable condition. Somewhat famous for its selection of fur coats, Beit T’Shuvah has, in addition to gently used designer wear and housewares, a decent-sized separate wing of furniture. Signs instruct buyers not to sit on the merchandise, ensuring that the lightly handled pieces stay that way until they find their way into a living room. This also means that none of the upholstery need be replaced or covered up — unless, of course, it’s hideous. Most furniture is too bulky or too expensive for student housing, but the pieces that are not too large are very reasonably priced for the quality.
Best finds: chenille loveseat and sofa set, $425; table and four chairs with oak tops and white legs, $85.
Wertz Brothers Inc.
11879 Santa Monica Blvd.
Los Angeles
Walking into this warehouse-style mecca is a bit like entering the Amazon — bird calls echo throughout the cavernous interior and there are enough exotic woods to rebuild a fraction of the rainforest. Three parrots whistle and play call-and-response with the customers as they wind their way through labyrinthine heaps of every piece of furniture imaginable. Block out a few hours to really explore the passages of this two-story retreat and come away with exactly what you were looking for — if not today, then tomorrow or the next day, as stock is updated daily. Don’t be fooled, though; not every piece is a bargain. If something is made of Brazilian rosewood, or rhino hide (no kidding) or is 18th century English, these purveyors are sure to know it and inflate the price accordingly, like any furniture dealer worth its salt.
Best finds: bachelor-pad-ready three-piece sectional, $395; side tables starting at $49.99.

There are certain events that we expect to enjoy without fearing that they will be punctuated by an obnoxious interruption.  Take, for example, going to see a movie at the theater, or taking mom out to a fancy, overpriced meal, or flying on a plane; in each instance, we step out of the boundaries of our comfortable USC bubble to experience what we hope will be a pleasant outing.
Then a high-pitched shriek pierces the air, followed by the inevitable wailing cry of what we can only assume is a human child — for no other object yet known to man is capable of creating quite as much noise on so little fuel.  A quick turn of the head (along with a glare for good measure) confirms that, yes, indeed, another inconsiderate family has chosen to cart along their unruly offspring in a doomed attempt to re-establish a normal life in the company of regular society.
Society, however, does not particularly care for these parents’ company in return; at least, not as long as they come attached with this new, incredibly vocal cargo.  I could do without the attention-seeking two-year-olds pulling on their flustered mothers’ split ends, or the four-year-olds who scream incoherently as their stressed fathers try to rationally explain to them why they have to eat all of their food before the pretty waitress will bring them dessert.
Unfortunately, there are not very many restrictions in place to prevent the potential presence of these newly-formed little people in social arenas.  Children are allowed almost anywhere their parents wish to go, and the mere suggestion of forming limitations would be enough to start a yuppie riot. 
Indignant parents need to recognize, however, that taking on the responsibility of raising a helpless being comes with certain undeniable constraints.  Parents: Life as it was, pre-baby, is no more.  Say goodbye to your social life and let the rest of us unattached individuals enjoy our trips out on the town in peace.
We are all supposedly programmed with a baby-loving gene -— it is in our DNA to find large eyes and big heads cute so we will be inclined to protect our young in their most helpless stages.  Our society raises females in particular to believe that we should all have a maternal instinct of some sort, because having children is an automatic stage of growing up.  Once you leave college, get a job and form a stable career, what else is there to do but move into a real house, have a kid and wait to get old? 
Some of us, however, fail to possess the baby itch.  We do not find their smell appealing, and we think the way they stare at us without blinking is more than a bit unnerving.  For us, the appearance of a child is enough to make us cringe in anticipation of the cacophony of noise that will inevitably erupt from those tiny but strangely powerful lungs.
Most students are too young and too ambitious to even remotely consider having children enter their lives at any point in the near future.  But the pregnancies will eventually start to arrive, though they may sometimes be rather unexpected surprises, and we will all have to get used to the many ways our social lives will be affected as a result.  Some of the requisite adjustments are going to be harder to accept than others, but a good rule of thumb in determining whether or not an activity is permitted with the accompaniment of a child should be this: If a tantrum is likely to cause a major disruption at some point, then it is time to give the babysitter a call. 
After all, a screaming child at a sit-down restaurant could ruin someone’s proposal dinner, the movie that some fanatic fanboy got dressed up for because he has been marking down the days until its release or the only blessed period of rest in which a tired traveler will finally be able to sit down and get some sleep before picking up his suitcases once again.  Child-friendly airlines should be established to cater to those parents who have already resigned themselves to eating solely at fast food restaurants instead of enjoying fresh pepper and wine at their favorite steakhouses — in other words, we need to help make the transition away from new parents’ former social lives as easy for them as possible. 
In actuality, the wide range of exciting new, kid-approved social realms should encourage parents to venture out into unexplored spheres of amusement with their beloved offspring.  Indeed, they can now fully experience the joys of Disneyland in ways they never did before.  And, of course, these weary young adults can still go out as they once did, back into the old territories of uninterrupted diversion — just as long as they leave their kids at home.

We know “National Treasure” is a no-good piece of postmodern Hollywood refuse, improbable as it is banal, but if we somehow manage, with great effort, to overlook the movie’s myriad shortcomings, we might see in it a real respect for the past — a truly admirable thing in this day and age.
In one scene in particular, Nicholas Cage’s character — for the record, this opinion piece is by no means an endorsement of Cage’s “acting” — quotes a line from the Declaration of Independence and then mournfully observes, “People don’t talk that way any more.” 
Press your ear up against the wall of Washington, D.C., and you’ll know he’s right: People really don’t talk that way any more. They talk worse. 
Political discourse nowadays is an exercise in saying nothing with great panache: pat, esoteric phrases that obscure more than they illuminate, conceal more than they reveal. Well, that really isn’t anything new. 
George Orwell famously wrote in his seminal essay “Politics and the English Language” that “the English language is in a bad way,” and there is a “special connection between politics and the debasement of language.” Of course, he wrote that in 1946, but the sad thing is, it’s still relevant today. Few have heeded Orwell’s advice to rethink their writing. The tendency of modern prose — political or otherwise — is still, as Orwell wrote, “away from concreteness.” 
As a subscriber to President Obama’s Weekly Address — a free iTunes podcast, and an ill-advised effort to channel President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s well-known fireside chats — I get to let the president invade my personal space for about five minutes each week, which is plenty enough for me. Now, it’s not exactly Obama I can’t stand; it’s the deadening language of politics. 
In Saturday’s Weekly Address, Obama began by saying, “Good morning. Over the past few months, as we have put in place a plan to speed our economic recovery, I have spoken repeatedly of the need to lay a new foundation for lasting prosperity.” 
What struck me wasn’t what Obama was saying; it was how he was saying it. In his essay, Orwell specifically mentioned “lay the foundation” as one of the “ready-made phrases” that corrupts language and keeps us from not thinking — and there is Obama, so often praised for his articulate speeches, using it in his first sentence. 
Now, this might sound like nitpicking, and it probably is. Obama shouldn’t be faulted for one cliché — especially when his predecessor had remarkable trouble formulating coherent sentences — because that’s the nature of the political beast: It strips people of their vividness and freshness, sucks them into the machine. But there is a sense that Obama isn’t as articulate as he once was. Recall that people, so enthusiastic after Obama’s praiseworthy speech on race, weren’t exactly impressed by his Inaugural Address. It was more clichéd than inspired. Obama is no Lincoln, that’s for sure. 
There is something even worse than hackneyed phraseology, though. In Saturday’s Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan, a preeminent political pundit and former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, wrote a particularly illuminating piece on “the indecipherable language of government” and how it has “actually become dangerous to the well-being of the nation.” She cited Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius as an example. Sebelius, in Noonan’s mind, gave “obscure and impenetrable” answers to questions about the administration’s health care plan, exemplifying the trend in political discourse away from concreteness and toward obscurantism. 
If anything, then, it looks as if it’s gotten worse since Orwell’s time. We’re past worrying about dying metaphors and the passive voice; we’re at the point where language has become a hindrance to understanding — esotericism over clarity. We need Orwell’s advice now more than ever. 
But there is also this to consider: “When the general atmosphere is bad,” Orwell wrote, “language must suffer.” Without question, the general atmosphere is, and has been for a while, generally bad, but there are signs of change ahead. Perhaps when the general atmosphere is good, language will improve. But it stands to reason that it should go both ways: When language improves, so too will the general atmosphere. 
If Obama wants to be the change Washington needs, he might consider rethinking not only the health care system but also the language of politics. It is an area ripe — overly ripe — for progress, and in need, one might say, of a new foundation.
