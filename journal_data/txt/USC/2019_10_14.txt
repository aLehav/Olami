Growing up in the Leech Lake Reservation in Northern Minnesota, David Treuer was taught to see his home as a place of sorrow and pain and to see his people, the Ojibwe Nation, as a broken community. Treuer confronted these negative emotions by starting to write a book in 2016 that became a nonfiction finalist for the 2019 National Book Award. 
“The Heartbeat at Wounded Knee,” the USC English professor’s seventh book, discusses Native American lives and culture from 1890 until now. It is one of five books in the United States shortlisted for the award. A committee will review the finalists and announce the winner in November. 
The book began as a pitch to his literary agent and editor as a part of his two-book deal, which included his 2015 novel “Prudence.” Treuer published his latest nonfiction book in January 2019.
“The Heartbeat at Wounded Knee” provides a counternarrative to Dee Brown’s “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,” which chronicles Native American life up until 1890. Treuer said he saw the need to tell stories of Native American life in the present day.
“[Brown] thinks … ‘The culture and civilization of the American Indian [were] destroyed,’ and I’m refuting that thesis and substituting a counternarrative,” Treuer said. “The narrative of the regrettable but necessary death and disappearance of native people [and] native cultures is the dominant narrative that attends the people’s thinking about us.” 
Treuer said Brown helped establish the longstanding belief that Native American tribes and cultures have faded from existence since the Wounded Knee Massacre, a conflict in 1890 that left 150 Native Americans dead. 
“Dee Brown announced our collective death in the opening pages of his book,” Treuer said. “I grew up … vulnerable to that myth. I couldn’t help but see the place that I was from as a place where good ideas go to die, a place that sucked, that was painful and violent and chaotic. In part, I think I was trained to see the place that I was from that way because of stories like Dee Brown’s.”
Treuer was also inspired to create a new narrative around Native American life, so that his children would grow up to have pride in their heritage and not face the same internal conflict he did. 
“You can’t understand this country unless you understand Native American history,” he said. “People think that slavery is the defining American characteristic, but those slaves would have had no plantations to work on if that land hadn’t been stolen from Indian tribes. There wouldn’t be an America to settle if there had not been a contentious and destructive relationship between first colonizers, and then the American government and native tribes.” 
Treuer’s literary agent Adam Eaglin said the book adds a necessary voice to American history. He hopes its designation as a finalist will lead to a wider audience for the book. 
“It’s an opportunity for greater recognition of the book,” Eaglin said. “What this does is it allows a greater number of people to be aware of the book because of the stature of the award, and it also allows us to celebrate the incredible work that David has done on the book.”
When presented with the fully fleshed-out proposal for the book, Eaglin said he recognized the lack of representation for Native Americans in the modern-era. 
Rebecca Saletan, editorial director at Riverhead Books, worked closely with Treuer on “The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee.” Saletan and Treuer had conversations before drafting on the shape and form of the narrative. 
“When he had it drafted, we did a lot of very detailed work … on tightening up the prose so that the book flowed well [and] so that the structure would sound so that the questions that I imagine a reader might have were answered adequately,” she said. 
Treuer said he is grateful for the award nomination and for the opportunity to be able to share his work with a wide audience who continues to support it. 
“I’ve had to work in what felt like the shadows for longer than I anticipated, and so I know what it feels like to devote yourself for five years to a book, and books are really strange — they’re physical objects but they don’t have any real existence unless there’s a reader on the other side,” he said. “Writers and readers, we come together through the books we write.”

The Department of Public Safety announced a suspect was in custody Sunday following several similar incidents of sexual battery near campus. 
The incidents, which occurred between Sept. 30 and Oct. 4, involved a man described as a Hispanic male with shoulder-length hair riding a dark-colored bike at different locations around campus, approaching women from behind at night and touching their buttocks.
DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle said that the suspect was detained after a DPS camera monitoring the area saw a person matching the description riding a bicycle on campus. 
The suspect was later arrested and booked by LAPD, Carlisle said. 
Carlisle said the suspect was not a USC student but rather a juvenile male who had access to the campus during normal business hours. Campus is open to the public until 9 p.m. 
While the juvenile’s motives remain unclear, LAPD will interview the suspect. Carlisle added that part of the investigation was to see if the suspect had been responsible for other cases, and he said the juvenile admitted to several of them. 
Based on the number of assaults the suspect was able to carry out, Carlisle said students at USC might be an easy target for such incidents. However, he said he believes that the current incidents will end now that the suspect has been identified. 
“It was reported to us that the person arrested admitted to doing several similar sexual assaults in the USC community, so we think that the immediate series of sexual assaults will end,” Carlisle said.

We live in a society. No, wait, that’s a stupid way to start a column. 
We live in a binge-watching society. There — that’s much better.
But seriously, we do. I’d hypothesize that it started some time around the rise of digital streaming in the early 2010s when everyone found out Netflix was a thing. Since then, we haven’t looked back. We said goodbye to recording shows we couldn’t catch live; we dumped our cable boxes in the trash; we stopped consuming our favorite shows episodically. 
We started scarfing entire seasons down in a single sitting. Hell, sometimes we scarf down an entire show, and not just those HBO limited series (as good as they are). We abandoned our healthy media consumption diets in lieu of binge-eating — er, binge-watching — and nothing was the same.
The only things that we had left to catch live on television were news and sports. And we already know the consequences of binge-watching cable news — just ask voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania (just kidding, I love my Midwestern fam).
All that leaves for live television is sports, and considering stagnated or falling overnight ratings in nearly all major sports leagues over the past several years, that’s not even a lock anymore. 
But there is still one sport that has fans foaming more than a pack of wild dogs for a piece of red meat: football. Duh-duh-duh-duh, da-na da-na! Duh-duh-duh-duh, da-na da-na! For those of you who didn’t get that, that’s ESPN’s Monday Night Football theme. For those of you who did … get outside, dude. 
Despite the sheer volume of well-researched and evidence-based hoopla surrounding football and its long-term physical and mental consequences, the sport is doing better than ever. Important college football games rank among the highest-rated cable presentations each year, and NFL ratings have soared since a brief decline two seasons ago.
What’s driving this boost? A dedicated fanbase with a hunger for more and, simply, better marketing of its stars. College football fans were so thirsty for the start of the season that this year’s season opener between the Miami Hurricanes and the Florida Gators was ESPN’s highest-rated game since 2016. In fact, football fans are so thirsty for football year-round that the WWE’s Vince McMahon thinks a spring football league will be financially viable as soon as February 2020.
Still, for the rest of you well-adjusted fans, there’s March Madness. March Madness’ popularity continues to rise, and it’s not hard to understand why. Your coworkers and friends may boast of their stamina and bad habits during the month of March, but, for many football fans, that’s every weekend from September until the Super Bowl. Every Saturday and Sunday, college and professional football dominate.
The craziest part? This happened long before streaming was a thing. Football has been America’s binge-watching sport for a while (if you’ve ever noticed the faction of drunk men and women in football jerseys on the weekends).
NFL Sunday Ticket, which allows fans to catch every single out-of-market NFL game, has existed since 1994 (!). NFL RedZone, a channel that sporadically jumps to every scoring play in every game, has existed since 2009. If sitting in front of the TV all day watching different episodes of a single sport isn’t binge-watching, I have no idea what is.
Football games simply aren’t enough for football fans either. Football-centric, binge-worthy reality television shows have become increasingly popular in the last several years, and not just among the most hardcore football fans. Shows like Netflix’s “QB1: Beyond the Lights” and “Last Chance U,” as well as HBO’s “Hard Knocks” and “24/7 College Football” are among the services’ most popular programs. On top of that, if real-life football drama wasn’t enough, scripted shows like “Friday Night Lights,” “Ballers” and “All-American” are popular among consumers who couldn’t even tell you how many yards are required for a first down.
Despite what so-called “experts” may say, football isn’t going anywhere. Quite the contrary, it seems that the sport has been waiting a long time for this cultural shift to shorter attention spans and massive overstimulation. In fact, it’s up to its gills with programs that can entice even the most casual fan to dive into football obsession headfirst.
To paraphrase the great Patches O’Houlihan: if you can binge-watch a show, you can binge-watch a sport. I think that plays — and if it doesn’t, let me know. You know where to find me: in my man cave, getting paler by the minute, watching a sport I love. Or at the sports bar, with the other people who can’t figure out how to better spend their fall weekends. One thing’s for sure: I’ll be there all weekend.

The USC women’s volleyball team dominated Colorado Friday before falling to No. 18 Utah Sunday to cap off its weekend road trip.
USC had complete control early on against Colorado. In the opening set, USC posted a .286 hitting percentage and collected 16 kills. Though the score went back and forth in the opening set, the Trojans were able to get the win and followed it up with a 25-20 victory in the second set. 
CU took a quick lead in the third set and eventually finished it off to extend the match. The fourth set looked the same early on with the Trojans going down by four early, but they were able to bounce back for a 25-23 win. 
Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier had another impressive night with a total of 24 points and 21 kills. The versatile Lanier didn’t stop there, holding up solid defense with three blocks, three digs and one service ace. 
As if Lanier’s game wasn’t impressive enough, she moved into sixth place for all-time career kills at USC with 1,643.  
Junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin and senior middle back Jasmine Gross both had more than 10 kills and a combined 11 blocks in the win against the Buffaloes. 
The Trojans were able to limit Boulder’s top offensive players en route to the win. The team played with exceptional rhythm, tempo and communication — attributes they had been missing in previous games. 
Although USC won, Lanier said the team needs to work on avoiding deficits early in sets. 
“I think the start is something we struggle with a little, even in the sets that we won,” Lanier said. “I think every set, you have to enter into it with the mentality that it’s 0-0. Even if you win and you came out with a hot start, you can’t expect that to flow into the next game.”
After the relatively smooth win, the Trojans learned a different fate and took a heartbreaking loss against the Utes. USC won the first two sets, but Utah stormed back and won the last three for the win. 
The Trojans’ blocking in the first two sets was phenomenal, and they limited the Utes on defense when they needed a big run. 
However, after the two sets, the Trojans allowed Utah to run away with leads for the rest of the match. The Utes limited the Trojans offensively, and USC struggled to get its rhythm back. 
The team appeared rattled in the last few sets, and its defense could not slow Utah down as USC allowed multiple players to tally double-digit kills. Every time the Trojans seemed to be starting a run, they would get shut down by the Utah defense. 
Sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro had a big day against Utah with 55 assists and her 10th double-double of the season. Still, her performance wasn’t enough, and USC could not manage the win.
“At the end of the day, during most games, it’s usually us not meeting the expectations we set for ourselves or losing focus sometimes,” Lanier said. “If we could learn how to coagulate our focus … that would be great for us.”
Lanier said the Trojans will be more focused on their own play than the rankings after the loss. 
“I think we’re our biggest enemy a lot of the time,” she said. “If we can focus on ourselves and tweak the things we need to, we’ll have some success on the road against Oregon.”
The Trojans will look to bounce back from the tough loss when they visit Oregon State at 7 p.m. Friday and Oregon at noon Sunday.

The No. 4 USC women’s soccer team added two more tallies to its win total this weekend with victories over Utah and Colorado at McAlister Field. 
The number two was the magic number of the weekend for the Trojans. Two goals were all they needed in each game as they took both contests by a 2-1 score. All 4 goals for USC came in the second halves, USC jumped to No. 2 in the Pac-12 and junior forward Tara McKeown picked up two game-winners. 
The Trojans started the weekend by welcoming the Utes Thursday afternoon. Things were quiet at McAlister Field until McKeown put the Trojans ahead in the 74th minute with one of the more impressive goals of the season. 
McKeown handled a cross that she flicked over the head of a Utah defender and rocketed into the net, all in the same motion.
As the clock wound down in overtime, USC seemed poised to escape with a 1-0 win, but a late corner kick set up Utah junior defender Alexis Rushlow in the 89th minute for the equalizer.
The Trojans’ first opportunity in extra time came in the 100th minute, as McKeown stepped up to seal the deal on a set piece from the outside of the penalty box. 
“We always work on those with [associate head coach] Jason [Lockhart],” McKeown told USC Athletics. “So I just knew where the wall was set up and where the goalie was, that she probably wasn’t going to be able to get where I was going to kick it in time. So I just shot it, and it went in.”
Fresh off the win, USC returned to McAlister Field to face the Buffaloes Sunday afternoon. 
Once again, the game saw a scoreless first half. A number of opportunities came USC’s way as the Trojans forced Colorado senior goalkeeper Jalen Tompkins to make six saves in the first half. 
Even with a zero on the scoreboard, the Trojans decided to not mix it up in the second half, sticking to the game plan that head coach Keidane McAlpine had laid out. 
“Do a little bit more of the same,” McAlpine said. “We had a couple ideas that we gave them in terms of trying to get into that width a little bit more.” 
The Trojans didn’t take long out of the second half gate to grab the 1-0 lead, as McKeown found sophomore forward Penelope Hocking in the box. Hocking turned and fired off the right post to put the Trojans ahead in the 48th minute.
It was the 11th time this season the two have connected for a goal. 
The lead was short-lived, as Colorado scored on its next corner kick to even things up at 1 in the 55th minute. Senior defender Kelsey Aaknes fired the corner toward the goal, and sophomore forward Libby Geraghty’s header knotted it up. 
In the eight games in which the Trojans have allowed goals, seven have included second half scores. As on Thursday, the opposition was able to find the net in the latter 45 against USC. 
With one game-winner under her belt on the weekend, McKeown was not finished. Just 64 seconds later, freshman midfielder Savianna Gomez sent a cross through the box, and McKeown headed it in for the lead. 
McKeown, who did not have a game-winner until USC took on Arizona Oct. 6, has had one in each of the Trojans’ last three games.
USC finished the game with a 2-1 win and swept the weekend at home against the mountain schools. Still, McAlpine saw room for improvement moving forward.
“Ultimately, that second goal came from getting into that width,” McAlpine said. “But really we were playing pretty well, so for us it’s more about putting more shots on frame, and I don’t think we did a great job of that today. We need to be better on that end.”
The Trojans improved to 11-1-1 on the season and 4-1-0 in Pac-12 play. It is the sixth straight season USC has won at least 11 games, a feat they’ve accomplished every year under McAlpine as head coach. 
USC will travel north to face Cal  Friday for a 4 p.m. kickoff.

USC’s 27,500 Graduate and professional students are spread across several campuses, including the University Park Campus, Health Sciences Campus, City Center, Alhambra Campus and Wrigley Marine Science Center. The campus with the second-highest number of graduate students is HSC.
This year, GSG Senior Vice President Sam Cwalina, with the support of the HSC directors and Senators, is aiming to address food insecurity at HSC. Currently, there is a scarce number of food options at the campus to serve the tens of thousands of students, staff, faculty, visitors and patients that visit HSC daily. The few on-campus eateries are only open until 4 p.m. — except The Edmondson Faculty Center, which is open until 7 p.m. on weekdays — and there are no dining options on weekends. Furthermore, HSC and the surrounding area is a food desert, leaving few off-campus options.
Earlier this year, GSG conducted a survey to assess the academic and health impacts of food insecurity at HSC. A staggering 83.3% of respondents, which also included staff and faculty, expressed dissatisfaction with the current on-campus food options. Most of the frustration stems from the lack of variety and the lack of healthy options, as well as the inability to purchase food at times when it’s most needed due to financial constraints. 
This survey allows Cwalina and I to develop and recommend solutions to university administrators. As GSG, we have the responsibility to serve the graduate student population across all USC campuses. The Edmondson is a less-than-ideal food option for HSC students. Due to their high prices, dining at the restaurant regularly wouldn’t be sustainable for students. To combat food scarcity and pricing, SmartFridges were installed across HSC, providing more food options for the HSC community. The SmartFridges were created by Everytable to provide health meals in food deserts. However, these can only service a small percentage of people at HSC and are by no means the solution to the HSC food insecurity crisis.
GSG’s Executive Board and Senators have also been working on multiple resolutions aimed at University administrators this semester that focus on student issues, with food insecurity being one of them. The first up for voting on Oct. 21 is GSG’s CalFresh Resolution, which will ask that food vendors and markets become CalFresh-authorized vendors.
To become an authorized vendor, a given retailer must meet certain federal eligibility requirements (quantity and types of foods stocked) and apply for official certification with the USDA. This provides USC with the unique opportunity to join a small group of innovative universities as a leader in its commitment to moral responsibility and diversity at all levels of the institution while also increasing the revenue of campus eateries. 
The resolution also calls on USC to institute a CalFresh matching program, which would offer dollar-for-dollar matching funds for a customer’s federal nutrition assistance benefits, to further increase access to food on campus. 
Resolutions passed by GSG are documents or motion that addresses graduate student concerns. These documents are presented to the Senate and passed by simple majority. 
Any graduate student may propose resolutions or amendments, but they must be sponsored by at least one sitting senator. Given this is a government process, there are procedures for proposing resolutions or amendments. 
Notice of resolutions or amendment must be given to the director of elections and recruitment at least one Senate Meeting before the Senate Meeting in which the resolution will be proposed.  Proposing senators are required to send a draft of the resolution or amendment to the director of elections and recruitment at least one week before the Senate meeting in which it will be proposed. 
To pass a resolution or amendment voting may take place in the same meeting in which it is proposed, or may be delayed to the next meeting. Expedited voting can happen in urgent cases at the discretion of the Director of Elections and Recruitment. Resolutions or amendments are presented at the closest Senate meeting and voted upon online up to one week following the presentation.
The students on this campus are represented within each of Graduate Student Government’s branches — administration, advocacy and programming — and the GSG senior vice president. The administrative branch contains a HSC director of finance who is dedicated to aiding HSC student organizations. The advocacy branch includes tje HSC director of diversity and equity. The programming branch contains three HSC directors of communications, community service, and social programming.
GSG’s policies, executive board and senators may seem like a far removed system from a graduate students focused on school — but GSG’s leaders are on the same boat too.
The passion I have for research is the same passion I have for helping my fellow graduate students focus just on being students while at USC. If you have an idea about tackling an issue on campus, start at GSG.

Last month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the U.S. House of Representatives into a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. The gravity of the news is self-evident, yet most Americans know shockingly little about government. A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania in September found that only 39% of Americans can name all three branches of the government.
For college students today, decisions in Washington have never been more important. If USC wants to ensure that its students won’t find themselves among the 39%, then it must begin to make civics education a priority and require all of its undergraduate students to take a course on civics. 
A 2012 report from the Department of Education recommended that colleges make civic learning and democratic engagement a “national priority” to help the country emerge from what it referred to as a “civic recession.” The statistics cited by the Department’s report makes such a recession readily apparent. In 2007, the U.S. ranked 139th out of 172 democracies in voter participation. From 2009 to 2010, only 10% of citizens contacted a public official. 
A 2018 Pew Research Center study found that the United States trailed most developed countries in voter turnout. Another study from the Center conducted the same year found that only 23% of citizens had contacted a public official in the past year. These statistics are chilling. 
Today, decisions are being made with drastic and far-reaching consequences. The officials behind these decisions are not appointed by divine mandate but are chosen by the American people. 
In 2020, the people of the United States will choose a president who will set the nation’s climate agenda for the foreseeable future, tackle challenges like universal healthcare and free college and may appoint a Supreme Court justice that could cement the fate of women’s reproductive rights for a generation, among other defining issues. 
If USC students are to weigh in on these issues and perform their most important civic duty — voting — then it is essential that they are intellectually equipped with the tools and knowledge necessary. 
Unfortunately, in the absence of basic civics education, many students will not participate in the upcoming election. In 2016, only 16%of all voters between the ages of 18 and 29 participated. In the same vein, without a commitment by USC to civic education of its students, many will remain unaware of what a district attorney is and unaware that they will have an opportunity to vote for one next November. 
USC’s mission claims that the University will continue to play a major role in the development of the nation and Southern California. If it truly hopes to achieve this, then its students must be challenged to wrestle with current events and truly familiarize themselves with the origins and aspirations of United States democracy. 
Efforts and initiatives such as the Unruh Institute of Politics and the Center for the Political Future welcome developments and have truly enhanced the school’s civic ethos. Unfortunately, these groups still largely attract those already civically engaged rather than converting the politically disinterested. 
USC students must receive the necessary civic education to make politically responsible and informed decisions. Without such an education, students are making some of the most important decisions of their lives on nothing more than mere hunches. 
Some argue that the lack of civic knowledge in the U.S. is nothing to lose sleep over. Americans have never been known for their civic knowledge and have managed to comfortably survive. 
It is true that Americans have long known little about civics or politics. It is also true that today, Americans face a $22 trillion dollar national debt, extreme political polarization, debilitating economic and social inequality and escalating rivalries with several major foreign powers. 
Clearly, our national lack of civics knowledge has not served us well. It appears that a required civic course for students is  long overdue.

Gryffin took the stage for his second consecutive evening Saturday night, enrapturing fans in a memorable set at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall.
Amid a thunderstorm of dazzling fluorescent hues, Gryffin showed off his musical talents through his skills on various instruments. Within the first five minutes of his set, he demonstrated his musical range: He played two different guitars, a keyboard, drums and even sang.
Before Gryffin came on, the crowd was greeted by DJ Jonas Blue. With a tight set that got the crowd ready for the headliner, Jonas’ confidence was palpable. Accompanied by shades of blue and giant lights flashing his name, Jonas played a cohesive and exciting set.
After an hour of Jonas Blue’s performance, the crowd waited patiently for Gryffin, who came on about 10 minutes late. 
Unlike Jonas, whose set was purely behind a DJ booth, Gryffin took command of the entire Shrine Expo Hall. The opening of his set created a moment of tension that burst upon his arrival. The venue was drowned in blue and green pulsating light as the drums grew into a rapid crescendo, signaling this show was going to be anything but simple.
With lights, lasers, pyrotechnics and huge LED screens, Gryffin took advantage of the space and the crowd’s energy throughout his whole set. One of the highlights of the show was his song “Tie Me Down,” where Gryffin let the crowd lead the show. Stepping away from his instruments and lifting his head toward the audience, the eruption of voices throughout the Shrine Expo Hall was extraordinary. 
As a venue, Shrine lends itself to a performer like Gryffin. Visually, the set featured every color imaginable and used the screens to take the crowd from the inside of a diamond to a rainbow paradise to outer space. The lighting and visuals partnered with the music in a way that kept the audience invested in the show. The show marks the beginning of Gryffin’s Gravity II Tour in support of his album that comes out Oct. 24. The Saturday show followed a sold-out Friday night.
Musically, Gryffin is a jack-of-all trades. He doesn’t stick to one thing, and he has tremendous talent live. Although he is usually described as an EDM musician, Gryffin’s live abilities rivaled those of any pop star. 
In the same vein, while many DJs and electronic and dance musicians produce whole sets from behind their booth, Gryffin eliminated that structure and used the whole stage. Swinging his guitar around, Gryffin ran around the stage from keyboard to keyboard (yes, he had multiple — each with different tonal qualities). With his talents, Gryffin became an artist that could win over those who are cynical of current EDM musicians.

“Send me a calendar invite.” Like most things in college, the weekly tradition of wine nights started on a whim between my friends at the start of this semester. Now, after drinking most of Trader Joe’s wine selection and then some, it amazes me how much wine night has become a staple in our college lives and a point of relief at the intersection of our hectic weekly schedules. 
The “work hard, play harder” mentality seems to be something that most USC students subscribe to, yet the playing part can also be work in and of itself, which defeats the whole purpose. Wine nights can bring the same, if not more, satisfaction without the stress or the expectation that every social interaction be extraordinary. The low commitment of a bottle of wine shared among two to three friends can be all we need to balance out the barrage that is academics, and the best part is that we can do it in the comfort of our home with minimal clean-up. 
The occasions in which most of us drink wine with our friends vary across campus. For this reason, do not let anyone stop you from drinking wine because they deem it invalid. Oozing over hot, perhaps not overly smart, men from “The Bachelorette” with your girlfriends with wine? Valid! Need to get something off your chest with friends and wine is the tool to help you do it? Valid! Grieving a recent break-up and drinking wine with friends to heal? Valid! Have no reason other than just wanting to drink wine with friends? Valid! As long as you’re drinking responsibly and everyone is on board, you do not need to justify wine night to anyone. 
Here are a few basic tips to keep in mind when planning a wine night:
Create a calendar invite (especially if this is a weekly thing) or a group chat for friends who are invited. 
Don’t feel obligated to invite people who you don’t 100% want to be there. Wine night is a “you” space (and if you’re not the host, ask before inviting anyone).
If more than two people are participating, it’s probably a good idea to get a selection of white wine and red wine to accommodate people’s preferences.
Drink white wines before red wines! It helps with digestion. But your wine night, your rules!
What gets said at wine night should probably stay within the wine night circle of friends.
Pretending to be a sommelier is always a good idea; it’s not as if most of your friends will know anything about the wine anyways.
Wine nights continue to be a special part of my USC experience, and I hope this is something you can share with your friends too. In the midst of studying for midterms, chasing down our dream internships and full-time jobs or dealing with emotional stress, we deserve a breather. For an hour or two every week (especially on weekdays), we should just be with people we care most about and take a step back to live the ordinary moments. Wine nights can be an open invitation that you could use to make that happen. 
P.S. Don’t forget that wine opener!

“Anastasia” promises a lot. It’s a show with ambition, a grand melodrama set against the backdrop of Europe in upheaval. Unfortunately, ambition doesn’t always equal success; in this case, it amounts to little more than fun and forgettable fluff.
The musical, adapted by playwright Terrance McNally from the 1997 animated film of the same name, begins in 1906, as 7-year-old Anastasia (Victoria Bingham) bids farewell to her grandmother who takes off for Paris. The musical then jumps to 1916, when the Bolsheviks deposes Russia’s royal family. Princess Anastasia is lost, presumed dead by most, and her grandmother (Joy Franz) is left alone in Paris without a family. Years later, after the Soviet regime has seized the country, two con-men enlist the help of an amnesiac named Anya (Lila Coogan) to try to convince the aging empress they have found her missing granddaughter. 
The show is called “Anastasia,” so Anya’s true identity is never much of a mystery for the audience. The drama lies in the journey, rather than the fairly predictable destination. It’s a shame, then, that the journey isn’t that much more interesting.
The score, composed by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, boasts a few standout numbers, including the highly publicized “Journey to the Past,” and never hits a foul note. Darko Tresnjak’s direction is consistently solid, and the heavy reliance on digital backgrounds gives the show a polished — if somewhat corporate — feel.
No single element is bad, per se. But with only a few exceptions, none are particularly inspiring, either. Each song and artistic choice is a riff on something that came before. The show is perfectly professional, but that’s not exactly high praise.
One such exception is Edward Staudenmayer as Vlad, one of the con-men who brings Anya to Paris. As his part is smaller and more overtly comical, he isn’t burdened with the hyper-sincerity that characterizes the rest of the cast. His movements and expressions are exaggerated as if he stepped out of a vaudeville act. His big moment isn’t an emotional ballad, but rather an extended dance sequence that is far funnier than it has any right to be.
His dance partner and comedic counterpart, Countess Lily (Tari Kelly), brings the same manic energy to the stage. The pair’s mostly physical comedy managed to get most of the theater laughing while barely saying a word. None of the performances match their energy or showmanship, even in a show as melodramatic as this one.
This is not to say that there is no place for melodrama; a whole show of comedic dance numbers would be exhausting, after all. 
Every musical needs a big heart-wrenching number, and “Anastasia” certainly delivers. Coogan gives an impressive rendition of “Once Upon a December,” one of the few songs to make the jump from the musical’s animated counterpart. But it is Anya’s duet with Dmitry (Stephen Brower), the younger and less goofy of the two con-men in “In a Crowd of Thousands,” that packs a bigger punch. It is sentimental and nostalgic, a moment of genuine emotion in a show that needs more of just that.
As a fun popcorn musical, “Anastasia” unquestionably succeeds. Like any middling pop song, it’s cute, sweet and catchy. But it isn’t the historical spectacle its marketing promised. Its sets are too digital, its songs too similar, its drama too pedestrian. 
It’s blandly inoffensive and, as stage shows go, easily reproducible. It was designed to be: it began on Broadway and will continue its tour long after its Los Angeles shows are done. And while the show makes for a perfectly pleasant evening, it never makes good on its promises of opulence and splendor.
