I never thought I’d say this, but the NCAA actually made the right call.
Monday’s ruling to grant spring-sport student-athletes an extra year of eligibility represented one of the few times I can remember in which the organization actually seemed to care about the collective interests of its athletes. The issue of extended eligibility wasn’t as black -and -white as many gave it credit for, and the NCAA’s decision acknowledges that complexity, balancing the concerns of student-athletes with the obvious financial ramifications for schools. 
There was plenty of speculation surrounding the NCAA’s decision in the days and weeks leading up to Monday’s announcement. Would eligibility relief be extended exclusively to seniors? What would happen with roster sizes and scholarships? Would the NCAA give any relief at all? 
In granting the extra year, though, it chose to properly consider the needs of athletes that had been stripped of well over half their season because of the coronavirus pandemic. Seniors can now go out on their own terms — nobody is robbed of a year of competition and, because of roster size and scholarship number expansions, incoming freshmen will bear a minimal burden.
It’s not a total win for student-athletes, however. A key caveat in the NCAA’s ruling is that those who would have exhausted their eligibility this year and choose to return for their additional year won’t be guaranteed their full scholarships — in fact, far from it. Schools have the authority to decide on a case-by-case basis how much aid that student should receive next year, whether that’s the full amount they awarded last year or no aid at all. That figure will certainly be a significant factor in almost every athlete’s decision on whether to stay or move on.
From the perspective of student-athletes, it’s not perfect. Yes, they have the option to redeem the year that was taken away from them, but it’ll come at a price that’s out of their control.
From the perspective of the NCAA and individual schools, it’s a necessary detail.
Like just about every other business in the United States, universities are poised to face significant financial repercussions as a result of the pandemic. Last Thursday, the NCAA announced that it would distribute $225 million to its various Division I programs in June — out of an original $600 million budgeted. My sympathy for the organization that knocks on the door of $1 billion in revenue each year is slim, but there’s an obvious ripple effect felt by athletic departments when the NCAA isn’t profiting at its usual standards. 
Combine that with the losses universities will undoubtedly face, and there simply won’t be much money to go around within athletic departments, especially considering the fact that less lucrative spring sports are typically financially supported by the school and not vice versa. Guaranteeing full scholarships to every returning senior just isn’t feasible, and even if it were, incoming and returning underclassmen would see their own aid reduced to balance it out. In that scenario, the entire recruiting landscape would be upended as athletes turn to schools where the financial opportunities are better — and there’s nothing schools could do about it. 
Thankfully, the NCAA avoided that. 
But the organization’s decision wasn’t perfect. Winter- sport student-athletes who had their seasons cut short are now officially done with their collegiate career. 
Eligibility relief for winter athletes was never a likelihood, but I have trouble understanding why. Sure, they only missed a small percentage of their season, but it was the part that they play for. They spent the entire season working toward their respective conference or NCAA tournament, and those parts — the most important ones — never happened. 
I understand it’s an easier call for spring athletes to receive an extra year than winter sports. But why not at least extend the latter the opportunity? They’d have the same reduced scholarship stipulation that spring athletes have, but it’s better to give them the option than nothing at all. 
At the very least, the NCAA should have accommodated seniors who missed out on championship competition and are ending their career on about as abrupt a note as possible. The long-term repercussions for underclassmen would have been minimal, as rosters could return to their original size in 2021 and athletes wouldn’t have to deal with crowding and a potential loss of playing time. 
But despite the NCAA making the wrong call in not offering any extra eligibility to winter athletes, the organization overall made the right decisions Monday.
And whenever the NCAA does that — as surprising as it may be — it’s worth appreciating.

Longtime stand-up comic, writer, voice artist and now executive producer-actor of CBS sitcom “Bob Hearts Abishola” Gina Yashere spoke to a School of Cinematic Arts class Thursday about incorporating her lessons from doing stand-up comedy into all facets in her career.
Born in London to Nigerian parents, the English comedienne originally worked as an elevator engineer before securing stand-up appearances on famed comedy shows such as “Live at the Apollo” and “Blouse and Skirt,” the latter focusing on the Black British experience. After working and achieving a great amount of success in the U.K., Yashere felt as though she hit the glass ceiling.
“I just felt like in England I was a big, big fish in a small pond,” Yashere said. “I wanted to expand, and as a Black performer in England, I thought I’d hit the glass ceiling. You know, because it’s such a small amount of talent, especially television, such a smaller market in England, and they have almost a nightclub policy when it comes to Black performers in England. One of us gets on TV, and then the rest of us have to sit back and wait ‘til they die to get on TV. So I was like, I can’t wait.”
In 2007, she made her U.S. comedy debut on the “Last Comic Standing,” a reality competition show for aspiring comics that earned her a spot in The Hollywood Reporter’s top 10 rising talents. Yashere has since focused her work in the States. One year later, she became the first and only British comedian to appear on “Def Comedy Jam,” the HBO comedy series that was the bedrock for the careers of comics like Bernie Mac and Dave Chappelle.
“It was filmed in L.A., there was a massive crowd that was, you know, a lot of comedians were like, ‘Oh, my God this is a big break,’” Yashere said. “But coming from England, I already had sort of 12 years of television experience under my belt and doing stand-up comedy television shows in England. For me it was just like, ‘Eh, this is fun.’”
Bayo Akinfemi, adjunct lecturer in the SCA Division of Film & Television Production and recurring actor on the Yashere co-creation “Bob Hearts Abishola,” invited Yashere to speak to the “Cinematic Communication” class to show Yashere’s evolution from a stand-alone comic to taking bigger roles in producing, writing and casting for a major studio. 
“I can absolutely testify to what she says there,” Akinfemi said. “I don’t know how she does it. We marvel at how much stuff she does. It’s just incredible to see her juggle all these different responsibilities, without missing a beat. It’s amazing.”
While hitting minor roles on TV series and correspondent spots on late shows such as “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” and “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” Yashere also produced three stand-up specials on Netflix while also starring in the second-season installment of the platform’s “The Standups.”
As the studios weren’t receptive to her audition tapes, she rented out 300-person theaters in London, sold tickets and shot her own specials to sell to Showtime and Netflix, owning the property and still making money on royalties. 
“I feel like comedy has gone the way of music, where it’s the younger, the hotter … are getting stand up specials over the older, funnier people,” Yashere said. “So when I came to America, I was not getting specials, nobody was offering me specials … I’d send tapes in to Comedy Central, to Netflix — all those guys — nobody was interested. So I was like ‘Well, fuck ‘em. I’m gonna make my own specials.’”
Yashere described the transition to working on “Bob Hearts Abishola” as an investment in her own talent. Chuck Lorre, creator of “Two and a Half Men,” “The Big Bang Theory” and “The Kominsky Method,” found Yashere through a Google search for a Nigerian woman to consult on a new show about a relationship between actor Billy Gardell and a Nigerian nurse. 
Her role was integral in creating the authenticity that shines through in the performances, including pushing for Nigerian actress Folake Olowofoyeku to play the lead, Yashere described in an interview with MEAWW earlier this week.  It was also vital to procuring the writing for several quippy scenes entirely in Yoruba, which secured her the executive producer and writer role on the show. 
Lorre brought some writers from his shows, but Yashere ensured that the stories, many of which were inspired by her own upbringing, were written from diverse perspectives. Five out of 8 writers in the room are women, two of whom are Nigerian and one who is African American. 
“When I was meeting with the guys and creating the show I was like, ‘Listen, we need some Black writers, you need some writers of color in this room. It can’t be all white dudes because half the cast is Nigerian,” Yashere said. “And if you want this to be authentic, I cannot be the only voice of color in this room.”
She ended the talk, after bantering with Akinfemi for keeping her over her time, with some advice for the students.
“Don’t wait for the gatekeepers to tell you whether your stuff is good enough or whether you’re good enough to have your product out there,” Yashere said. “There are so many, so many ways to share your work now that you don’t need to wait for anybody.”

As it looks like none of us will be going outside any time soon, streaming has stepped up to fill the gaps left in my day. While it’s no substitute for human interaction, at least I’ve got sweet, sweet content to pass the time. Here are a few recommendations.
HBO
“Westworld,” season three (new episodes every Sunday)
So far, the third season of HBO’s sci-fi epic about the rise of artificial intelligence falls neatly in line with its two previous seasons: It’s about as silly as it is smart. For every novel idea there is a lackluster fight scene or robot dragon to even things out. I’ve always enjoyed when the show leans into its pulpy roots (a holdover from Michael Crichton’s original ’70s blockbuster), but it’s a delicate balance. And at this point, it’s a balance that the show’s producers seem largely uninterested in maintaining. 
The central storyline, which sees former “Westworld” android Dolores finally break out of the park and arrive on the mainland to lead a robot uprising, gives us a glimpse of a novel futuristic Los Angeles. Rather than the obviously bleak dystopia of a movie like “Blade Runner,” “Westworld”’s central city appears as a gleaming utopia. Insidious forces are, of course, still at the top of the pyramid, but they’re not always obvious in the ways they maintain their oppressive order. It’s a clever premise and has led to some of this season’s best moments (the fight scene that closes out the first episode was one of my favorites).
But then there are the show’s other stories. Since the show is called “Westworld,” it can’t entirely leave its titular location behind. And yet, every time we cut back to the now mostly ruined amusement park, the pacing grinds to a halt. It’s well explored territory. Even the World War II-themed War World felt stale when compared to the season’s best moments. When focused on characters still in the park, “Westworld”’s producers have free reign to make things as pulp-y as they like. But what worked in earlier episodes now seems like an artifact from an entirely different show. Still, season three is more than worth the watch just to see where Dolores ends up (even if you end up fast forwarding through everything else).
“The Plot Against America” (new episodes every Monday)
A lot of critics have hailed “The Plot Against America,” adapted from the Philip Roth novel about a Jewish family contending with the rise of U.S. fascism in the early ’40s, as “prescient” or “vital” given the coming election. While I would agree for the most part, it’s also a lot more than that. 
Too often “social issue” television is so focused on the ideological matter at hand that its characters are all but forgotten (I’m looking at you, “Years and Years”). “The Plot Against America,” on the other hand, is general enough to remain relevant more than 15 years after its source material was published and specific enough that its emotional center remains intact.
Even so, it won’t be for everyone. It’s slow — unbearably so at times — and fixates on the mundane as much as it dramatizes the sweeping changes of history. It’s also, despite what many have said, far from essential. If you’re looking for something comforting during this stressful time, I would steer clear. But if you’re willing to put up with a little added stress, I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Amazon Prime
“Tales from the Loop” (premieres April 3)
While I can’t vouch for the show as of yet, I have been looking forward to it for weeks. Based on the work of Simon Stålenhag (and the tabletop role-playing game to which he lent his art), a Swedish artist known for his beautifully mundane science fiction landscapes, the show is a pseudo-anthology series with a few recurring characters who pop up every episode. It looks slow and strange — like much of Stålenhag’s work — and I’m really hoping it lives up to its potential. 
“Emma”
Instead of remaining trapped in shuttered theaters for a few more weeks, Focus Features decided to release Autumn de Wilde’s recent adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel “Emma” online early. The trailer paints the movie as a snappy, transgressive take on the source material and while the version we got is mostly traditional, it’s still stylish. It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, but I’m willing to bet it’s better than the Gwyneth Paltrow version.
Disney Plus
“Onward” (available April 3)
While it’s already available to buy or rent, Pixar’s fantasy-comedy will be coming to Disney Plus April 3. It’s not one of the studio’s best, but it’s cute and has some surprisingly impressive visuals. It’s no “Lord of the Rings,” but some of the landscapes look like they were plucked straight out of Middle Earth.
“National Treasure” (available April 30)
The Nicolas Cage classic is just as wild on your 30th viewing as it was on your third. It’s not a great movie by any means, but it has a manic energy that is absent in a lot of other mid-tier adventure films.

While cannabis intersects with many facets of U.S. popular culture, none are probably quite so apparent as the innumerable connections between music and weed. Beginning with historical jazz classics dating back to the early 20th century and continuing with the multigenre cannabis anthems of the modern day, people have been both referencing the substance in their songs and blazing up to bangers for generations.
From Cab Calloway to Snoop Dogg, Sublime to Lana Del Rey, artists who write songs about weed have a long history of producing timeless hits (pun very much intended). Although odes to cannabis have origins in jazz, reggae and hip-hop, songs about weed span across myriad genres, including country, rock and, more increasingly, pop and alternative/indie. 
Hit songs that feature lyrics referencing weed have increased over the past three decades, according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine. Three out of four Top 40 songs in 2016 mentioned cannabis — more than any other drug, such as alcohol, included in the study. Researchers found that the increase in references mimicked national trends in mainstream culture, which were shifting toward cannabis acceptance and destigmatization. 
Pot has quickly cemented itself as one of the most used motifs in music today, and it’s not really that surprising to see why. Aside from sweeping legalization efforts across the country and changing attitudes, the substance has long been thought to amplify how we perceive, make and enjoy music.
You’ve often heard from cannabis connoisseurs and activists that weed simply makes everything better. In earlier iterations of my column, I discussed the magnifying qualities of being high: the way cannabis can enhance creativity and pleasure, stimulate the senses and boost focus on certain sensations. At the same time, given weed’s biphasic effect and the complex ways it interacts with cognition and perception, cannabis can produce opposing results — leading to hyperconcentration and overstimulation, whereby the brain is overwhelmed by the sensory input from its surroundings.
So think about the multidimensional, interwoven layers that make up any song — the beat, instrumentals and vocals — and how that could, and does, captivate the casual stoner and immerse them in a world filled with sensory overload (in my experience, usually in a good way). Plenty of anecdotal evidence supports these claims, but empirical data, as always, is lacking in the cannabis field. 
Cannabis consumption usually results in slower time perception, or a faster inner clock, which can improve musicians’ ability to improvise and experiment with their tracks, according to Jörg Fachner, professor of music, health and the brain and co-director of the Cambridge Institute for Music Therapy Research. This was particularly useful at the height of the Jazz Age; melodies lit up as musicians did, allowing the genre’s greats, such as Louis Armstrong, to envision the patterns within their rhythms and fine tune them.
Another potential explanation for why music sounds better while stoned is that THC binds with receptors in the brain responsible for controlling memory, disrupting the retention of information in the short term. As the high mind attempts to rapidly process the ever-changing auditory input from songs, it inadvertently forces itself to live in the moment, forgetting the note played prior. Simply put, for stoners listening to music, time seems to come to a standstill. 
“Unable to explicitly keep in mind what has just been played, or to think ahead to what might be played, people stoned on pot tend to hear music from note to note,” writes music psychologist Daniel Levitin in his book “The World in Six Songs.” “They live for each note, completely in the moment.”
Anecdotal evidence also seems to suggest the interplay between listening to music and smoking cannabis produces a synergistic effect, where one heightens the effects of the other and vice versa. Since both produce strong emotional responses, they in turn feed off of each other to produce a greater reaction.
This notion is supported by a 2011 study that showed cannabis produces a mild synesthesia, or the blurring between sensory information. While the different regions of the brain are not remotely distinct, weed, in theory, can cross the boundaries between each processing area, meaning that the way we experience melodies is richer, deeper and more intense.
A 2008 neurological study also demonstrated that cannabis produced increased activity in the brain similar to the patterns found when gifted mathematicians solved problems, indicating that people who listened to music while high were more relaxed and had less trouble concentrating and listening to the melodies. However, since the study only tested four subjects, the research cannot be extrapolated to far-reaching conclusions about cannabis’ effect on music processing.
Fachner, who conducted the study, also found early links between cannabis and hearing therapy. According to his research, cannabis could help those with hearing impairments improve their listening capabilities, differentiate between sources for sounds and hear higher frequency sounds more clearly.
Since there is a lack of sound data-based evidence linking weed to better auditory perception, it’s possible that the expectation that music sounds better after smoking — something we’ve been trained to believe through widespread adages in popular culture — produces a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we think music will sound better when we’re high, it most likely will.
Before I lay out my pot playlist, don’t hate me if your favorite classic stoner jam isn’t on it; I figured I’d keep it short for the stoners who will inevitably feel like they’re listening to a five-hour-long tracklist and for those who will let it replay three times before thinking, “Wait a minute…” While I love Dr. Dre’s “The Next Episode” as much as the next gal, and though Afroman’s “Because I Got High” never fails to put a smile on my face (and I can’t — I won’t — forget Nicki Minaj’s iconic “You don’t want smoke with me, this is a laced blunt” in “MotorSport”), I had to settle on the songs I consistently come back to when I’m mellow. 
With stay-at-home orders in effect across many U.S. cities, what better time than now to smoke weed and listen to music? In all seriousness, though — because we can’t go (and shouldn’t be going) anywhere right now, this is the perfect time to pull out your bud and your quarantunes playlist. To help get you started, here are some of my favorite odes to weed, whether lyrically or sonically, to kick off your monthlong 420.

While social isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic can be difficult, it can also be a great opportunity for self-improvement. Students have more free time to use to their advantage with the rest of the semester moved online and regular extracurricular activities canceled because of campus closure. Even if it’s as simple as fixing their sleep schedule or learning how to cook a basic meal, students have a unique opportunity to practice self-improvement and self-enrichment.
Even for those working remotely or holed up in their childhood bedroom watching Zoom lectures, the amount of free time is abundant. Like it or not, social and extracurricular obligations have dissipated, leaving many students lonely, bored and missing on-campus life. While virtually commiserating with students across the country in the Club Penguin pizza parlor or taking a nap in the middle of the afternoon are valid forms of self-care in their own right, students now have the opportunity to refocus on themselves. 
Malcolm Gladwell’s 2008 book “Outliers” famously explores the habits of successful people. Examining the factors needed to become outstanding performers, businesspeople and inventors, Gladwell breaks down a psychological principle known as the “10,000 hour rule.” This concept suggests that natural talent in an area can only take someone so far — putting in 10,000 hours of deliberate practice creates a level of proficiency rivaling any level of natural aptitude. 
While 10,000 hours of practice is hopefully an overstatement in the case of the coronavirus stay-at-home order, the same principles can be applied toward learning a new skill with this newfound break from everyday life. Whether you want to work on your jump shot, build an app, learn to play the ukulele that’s been gathering dust in the closet or create an aesthetic art piece, those looming empty hours can open up a world of possibility. Taking even a few minutes every day to work on a skill can be extremely beneficial; for example, just a jog around the block every day for a month is a step forward in building endurance. 
A quick 10,000 hour rule disclaimer: Gladwell notes that there are many other external factors that go into achieving fame and being outstanding in one’s field, in addition to putting in the work. He talks about the connections and support the Beatles had in getting more gigs, as well as Bill Gates’ early access to computers in the 1970s. The chances that one will come out of quarantine able to beat Steph Curry in a game of “horse” are slim, but a few minutes of daily diligent and focused practice will culminate in significant improvement in any area or skill.
During a typical semester, it can be easy to push physical and mental well-being aside as students pursue a perfect GPA and enjoy social life. Whether or not one chooses to take advantage of more lenient grading options this semester, this anomalous experience allows students to be more cognizant of their own health; creating a simple schedule, getting a healthy amount of sleep, making sure to interact with friends and family, setting aside leisure time and engaging in intellectually stimulating activities are all good ways of trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy. 
While this quarantine period is an opportunity to reflect on and improve daily habits, remember that taking the time to do something relatively unproductive — whether it’s sledding on Club Penguin, watching Netflix or taking a nap — is just as valid. Take advantage of online resources — there’s no end to the number of online courses, book PDFs, fitness apps, movie streaming sites, Instagram live concerts and other fun and enriching opportunities that are being offered for free right now. To maximize spare time during the remaining weeks of remote instruction, the key is moderation. 
The coronavirus pandemic is life-altering and history-making, and isolation can be frustrating and dull. However, there are countless ways to take advantage of this temporarily slowed pace of life while still adhering to social distancing recommendations.

Where there are gaps in academic and career achievement for underprivileged kids in the Bay Area, alumna Jacqueline Diep works to build bridges. 
Diep, a 2018 graduate, spearheaded the program The Big Homie Project, in spring 2019 to provide opportunity for a demographic that often falls through the cracks. The program aims to connect rising high school juniors and seniors in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America with a “big homie” mentor and help marginalized students enter career fields where they are often underrepresented. 
Working at tech giants such as Facebook and Google, Diep said she would often get caught up in the day-to-day grind that defines the startup capital but wanted to extend herself further than just her job and give back to her community. Looking toward her immediate surrounding area, Diep centered The Big Homie Project on a demographic she felt needed the most attention — youth in East Palo Alto, a predominantly Black and Latinx city in the Bay Area that is often stigmatized as dangerous. 
“My goal is that every kid figures out a way out of a community like East Palo Alto,” Diep said. “Facebook is a few blocks away and you have all these companies that are a few blocks away and yet you have this community over there that’s struggling.”
Diep’s desire to help underprivileged youth is inspired by her own story: After growing up in foster care and struggling with homelessness, she credits the mentors throughout her life for achieving her goals. Diep said she believes healthy mentorship is the biggest contributor to a student’s success and drive.
“I realized that I would not be where I am at today, I would not be a high school graduate, a college graduate, let alone a USC graduate, had it not been for my social worker, my teacher, mentors, people who just really looked out for me,” Diep said. 
Diep hopes that through The Big Homie Project, she can give back the mentorship she received and provide essential guidance for students just like her. 
“For most people who come from either underserved communities or come from the background I come from, we don’t talk about it,” Diep said. “It’s never ever a ‘poor me’ story because that will never ever get you out of the circumstance that you’re in. You have to be able to just push forward. And what I realized was that [with] a lot of kids in the community, especially East Palo Alto, I saw a mirror image of myself, basically.” 
Diep’s search for adults to mentor students goes further than their success; she looks for mentors who come from similar backgrounds and demographics as the students she aims to help, as she believes representation is a key component for students to thrive. 
“When you’re able to visualize and see someone who looks like you in a position or doing something that you might want to do, it’s more [easily] obtainable,” Diep said. 
Makayla Miller, a senior at Palo Alto High School and a student in The Big Homie Project, hopes to study psychology or social work and said she has found great guidance in her “big homie” Auriel August, a Stanford general surgery resident. Miller said having a mentor who she can personally relate to and see herself in keeps her motivated and focused. 
“When you see people on TV, you’re like, ‘Oh, that’s a one in a million chance that could happen for me,’” Miller said. “But when it’s someone that is in your community, someone that you can call on the phone and talk to if you want to, then it’s more like, ‘I can continue pursuing what I want to pursue and I can get to where I want to get because this person did.’”
Diep said exposure was the first step to fulfilling the achievement gap that many underprivileged youth face, but success in college and career pursuits is not the only goal of The Big Homie Project. The organization also prioritizes opening doors to new experiences and hobbies for the students, such as joining sports teams or going to recreational centers in the area. 
“Some of these mentorship programs [are] very generic and it’s like, ‘Oh, let me help you with homework or let me help you with college applications,’ but [our goal is to] peel back that layer a little bit more,” Diep said.
Rock climbing was never something Miller would have considered taking up as a hobby had it not been for her mentor organizing an outing to the local Planet Granite facility. 
“Kids — if they’re not given exposure to certain things, they’re not gonna know what it is,” Diep said. “But through rock climbing, [Miller’s] confidence was built and she’s now a very advanced climber because of The Big Homie Project.” 
Julian Jenkins, the senior director of regional recruiting for the company Next College Student Athlete and avid supporter of The Big Homie Project, said he has seen how inspirational Diep has been to community members in the East Palo Alto and greater Silicon Valley area. 
“There’s a lot of people that want to give back and a lot of people that like giving back to young people but may not just know how to do it,” Jenkins said. “So [Diep] gives them a platform because she’s actively doing it.”
Diep said The Big Homie Project is unique in that it not only works to inspire the youth in the area, but it also allows adults to see the impact they can have on students’ lives without it being dependent upon monetary donations or other financial help. 
“Yeah, of course you can give them money … but time and physically being there … there’s not much to replace that,” Jenkins said.
Diep said she is certain volunteering as a mentor for marginalized youth and creating networking and bonding opportunities for them is far more impactful than any amount of money could be. 
“For me, the monetary exchange is you and the position that you’re in and the fact that you can actually help a kid and you can change someone’s life without having to open up your wallet,” Diep said.

When Michael Broughton was struggling to get a loan approved for his tuition at USC with no credit score, he was inspired to create Hatch Credit, a startup company to help college students build their own credit. 
In partnership with the Career Center, Student Affairs, several universities — such as California Institute of the Arts and UCLA — and a few banks, including the USC Credit Union, Hatch was able to help students improve their credit score by reporting their regular payments, such as monthly gym memberships or entertainment subscriptions, to credit bureaus.
“I realized a lot of students fall victim to [this problem], but they just don’t realize it until their senior year when they’re trying to get their first car or their first phone plan or even trying to get their own apartment,” said Broughton, a junior majoring in business administration. “They struggle and end up having to go back home, all because they don’t have a credit score.”
Samuel Acosta, one of Hatch’s first users, wanted to rent an apartment in Michigan but was unable to since he didn’t have a credit score. 
“It made me more aware of how important it is to actually start reporting credit,” Acosta said. “I was kind of lost as [to] how to actually get started. There’s not a lot of information out there for people that think ‘I don’t owe anything, so I don’t need to do anything for my credit.’”
Broughton and his team began their work by interviewing more than 2,900 students from USC, UCLA and CalArts on their knowledge of personal finance. Through this, they found that students weren’t interested in learning about personal finance but instead wished for an easy way to build credit, which inspired Broughton to help students do so through their regular payments to entertainment subscriptions, such as Netflix and Spotify. 
“Out of all the students we talked to, about 98% of them told us it was a terrible idea,” Broughton said. “They really didn’t connect to personal finance, and that’s when we learned that there’s a lot of information out there, but students just don’t care about personal finance.”
Broughton worked in collaboration with Sebastian De Vivo, a consultant for Bixel Exchange, a nonprofit organization that matches startup entrepreneurs with advisers and provides them with free, non-equity assistance. 
“From the beginning, [Broughton] had a very strong idea of what he was looking to do and how,” De Vivo said. “It was just a matter of seeing where we could step in and bring resources to help him get there.” 
De Vivo acted as a thought partner, listening to Broughton’s ideas and strategies and providing feedback to strengthen Broughton’s product. 
“People have tackled that problem [of building credit] from different directions, but Mike was the first one that I heard that targeted specifically the college student population,” De Vivo said.“The way he brought all the different threads together was also unique to Mike.”
The team went on to win its first pitch competition, TAMID Tank — USC’s version of “Shark Tank” that allows students to pitch their startups to venture capitalists — in October 2019. They moved on to win several more, including the top $25,000 prize at the Blackstone LaunchPad Propel event in New York. Hatch currently operates at a net worth of about $500,000. 
“I think [Broughton] is one of the more exceptional entrepreneurs that is still at USC,” said Blackstone LaunchPad USC project director James Bottom. “His venture at this event was one of the top four at USC, and he beat the top 100 projects from all across the globe in the Blackstone LaunchPad network.” 
Through Hatch’s mobile app, Broughton created a platform dedicated to teaching college students about personal finance through simple, easy-to-follow lessons such as how to set up a mortgage payment and how to begin paying back college loans. The app is live and operating in its developmental stage and has allowed 1,000 users onto the app from a waitlist of 16,000. Broughton hopes this number will increase to 100,000 over the summer.
“Long term, we would love to see this company exit to a bigger company in this space, like Credit Karma, NerdWallet, Mint or Intuit,” Broughton said. “It’d really be able to help hit as many students as we can.”

“Chinese virus,” my neighbor muttered. 
My parents were in our driveway, walking back from the mailbox when our neighbor felt compelled to reduce them to a disease. I didn’t know anything about them except for the silver “USC Alumni” license plate frame on their car and their now apparent distrust of the Asian American family who had lived across the street from them for years. 
This incident happened nearly two weeks ago — the last straw in a chain reaction of stressful events that have plagued me since USC first declared its move to online classes. With the coronavirus outbreak, both my parents lost their jobs, my twin sister and I left our respective college campuses and our lives now revolve around anxiety-ridden news updates. Morale is low as we wait for a federal stimulus package check that may take upward of several weeks to arrive, and quarantine feels like a futile prison. 
Yet life stumbles along as I try to muster enough motivation to engage in my Zoom classes (one of my lectures featured a particularly graphic incident of Zoombombing, where an unknown person spewed racist epitaphs including “Wuhan virus,” which felt like another personal attack against my Asian identity). I use daily runs in the park as a legal excuse to get out of the house. Maybe I’m just paranoid, but every time I venture outside, I see lingering stares and extra-concerted efforts at social distancing. I try to come to terms with the fact that I am now seen as an even greater threat in this already paranoid reality. 
I had considered myself lucky to have grown up in Seattle. My family and I, until now, had never experienced any blatant forms of racism, and I valued the seemingly open-minded community we lived in. 
But now, that racism is taking the center stage.
As a low-income student who currently relies on a combination of University grants, Pell Grants and a work-study job to pay for school, it hurt me to see my parents’ work hours gradually be reduced until they finally had to file for unemployment. I faced a similar dilemma with my own on-campus job until USC thankfully continued pay for student workers until the end of the semester, regardless of whether or not they’re able to work remotely.
But the sudden loss of the rest of the spring semester is slightly less universal. I’m grateful to USC Housing for not immediately evicting everyone following the transition to online classes, but the fear of potentially being stuck in Los Angeles with domestic flight reductions — as well as the implied message that those who could would have to leave campus eventually — propelled me to pack up as much as I could and book a painfully expensive flight back home. My departure from USC felt abrupt and disappointing but was still significantly better than my sister’s four-day notice from Vanderbilt University to pack everything up and move back across the country before she was kicked out of her dorm. 
Home gave me some much-needed rest during spring break, but as Zoom classes started the following week, I immediately found it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork. Watching the number of coronavirus cases exponentially rise every single day and wondering how I would be able to pay for tuition next semester as the global economy veered toward another recession occupied my mind, and papers and midterms were knocked down my priority list. It’s difficult to focus on an academic future when the present already appears so suffocatingly bleak. 
But even with all these problems in mind, what occupies my mind the most is the fact that my identity, despite my adherence to quarantine orders, still labels me as someone to blame for it all. I’ll admit that I’ve been sheltered from previous encounters of racism, but my realization that it’s finally occurring now comes as our collective trust is fracturing — even members of my supposed Trojan Family have now decided that my race poses a threat to them.

The fourteen parents contesting charges in the college admissions scandal, including 11 with USC ties, filed a motion in federal court Wednesday to dismiss their case, arguing that it should not be heard in Massachusetts District Court.
The memorandum supporting the motion stated that the Operation Varsity Blues parents’ alleged crimes did not occur in Massachusetts and argued that the government did not have grounds to indict the parents as a group. According to the memorandum, the only common factor all the parents shared was the involvement of scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer.
“The government has attempted to create venue in this District by lumping defendants together in a single conspiracy, alleging cherry-picked acts that are unrelated to the conspiracy’s objective, and fabricating ties to this District through the unilateral conduct of a government Cooperator,” the memorandum read.
Ten of the parents’ cases had no connection to Massachusetts aside from conspiring with Singer, who made calls related to the college admissions scheme and sent a check to senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel while residing in Massachusetts, according to court documents.
In a separate motion filed Wednesday, the defense contended that the parents’ involvement in the admissions scheme did not merit the charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. The defendants referenced ACT, Inc.’s policy that indicates scores are the property of the test-taker to argue that the actions of the parents in the scandal did not meet the criteria for fraud committed against the testing companies. 
“The Government’s theory — that standardized test scores are ‘property’ of the testing companies and that cheating on a test is therefore within the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes — would represent an alarming expansion of federal criminal law,” the motion read.  “It would mean that almost any conceivable form of cheating on an exam, even copying off a neighbor’s answer sheet, could constitute a federal felony punishable by up to 20 years’ imprisonment.”
The defendants also asked that the honest services fraud charge be dropped because employees of the testing companies are not legally bound to act in the companies’ best interests, which they said rendered the allegations of fraud invalid.
Fourteen parents pleaded not guilty to charges in the college admissions case and will stand trial in Boston federal court. All the parents have motioned for charges to be dismissed. 
Trials for the first group of parents who opted to contest charges are set to commence Oct. 5, with jury selection beginning Sept. 28. The coronavirus outbreak will not affect trial dates, federal judge Nathaniel Gorton stated in an order filed last month.

Although many artists and musicians have pushed back their tour dates and album releases due to the coronavirus pandemic, there’s still new music waiting to fill your speakers and new artists to uncover. In troubling and uncertain times, music provides us with comfort and a safe space to listen, connect and be entertained. As April springs upon us and students continue to attend online classes, you may find yourself searching through old CDs, your Spotify account, Pandora or your grandparents’ old records to find something new. Everything you need, you can find here.
Coming this Month
“The New Abnormal” — The Strokes
If you’re a fan of indie music and you haven’t heard of The Strokes, you’re missing out. But now is the time to widen your indie music knowledge! The rock band from New York City is set to release their sixth studio album April 10. Music from The Strokes typically has a warm, hazy indie rock feel with upbeat guitar tones and solid drum beats. Their style is perfect for anyone who has a great affinity for indie, loves bands like Arctic Monkeys and wants some easy rock listening music. They have a very lo-fi sound that hooks you in the more you listen.   
“These Two Windows” — Alec Benjamin
Singer-songwriter Alec Benjamin’s highly-anticipated debut album is coming out Friday. New to the industry, Benjamin’s sound is intimate and honest. His music is vulnerable and he tells stories through lyrics. His work can be suggestive of the indie-pop genre with acoustic-driven ballads and pure emotion. He’s a storyteller and a musician, offering a contemporary perspective on life and laying bare raw emotions we all feel at one point or another in our lives.  
“You And Your Friends” — Peach Pit
Set to be released Friday, indie group Peach Pit is back with its sophomore studio album. Their latest is a follow up to the group’s 2017 album, “Being So Normal.” The new album, according to the band’s vocalist Neil Smith, is a more personal collection. There are songs in the album that relate to the people the band deeply cares about — songs about spending time with old friends and narratives about their personal experiences. It seems like this album is coming at the perfect time, as we all hunker down and bond over nostalgic memories. 
Songs Released by your Favorite Artists Out Now
“You’ll Miss Me When I’m Not Around” — Grimes
True to Grimes’ style, this beat comes along with a video that features unusual fashion styles and visuals along with a green screen backdrop. Her sci-fi look in the video is reminiscent of her early “Miss Anthropocene” days. With a CGI background, Grimes hopes that fans will use the screen to create their own edits of the video. The sound and vibe is dark yet hopeful and highly electric and pop-esque. It’s similar tonally and sonically to Grimes’ song “Delete Forever,” but the lyrics dive even further than the melody in meaning. 
“Take Yourself Home” — Troye Sivan
Releasing music earlier than expected this year, 24-year-old Australian pop artist Troye Sivan has never been one to shy away from making moody tracks with dark synth pop sounds. Sivan sings about being “tired of the city,” and it seems he longs to be in a place more welcoming and charming. This song is about appreciating where you’re from, being young and attempting to understand your place in the world. Things change, people change and places change, and I think that’s why Sivan released this track early. 
“And happiness is right there where you lost it / When you took the bet / Counting all the losses that you can’t collect / Got everything and nothing in my life.”
April spotlight: Artist on the Rise
Celeste 
If you’re searching for a new artist to listen to this month, look no further than Celeste. The 25-year-old British singer-songwriter has a rich voice reminiscent of ’50s and ’60s soul singers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Aretha Franklin, blending together contemporary R&B and jazz genres. Celeste attended the 2020 Brit Awards in February, where she won the award for “Rising Star.” It was well-deserved — her live performance at the show completely captivated the audience, leaving them entranced by her voice and expression. In the singer’s latest release, “Stop This Flame,” it’s evident that she is an incredible lyricist who has the potential to become an icon. 
From her voice to her lyrics, Celeste is an empowering female artist on the rise who we can expect to see more from in the coming year. In the meantime, Celeste has upcoming tour dates in line this year at various music festivals and venues around the world. Although subject to change due to current regulations surrounding the coronavirus, the singer is still scheduled to be in Los Angeles June 6 as part of the lineup for Virgin Fest, where other artists such as Lizzo, A$AP Rocky, Anderson. Paak and Major Lazer are also set to perform.

Texas A&M senior point guard Alex Caruso did not hear his name get called during the 2016 NBA Draft. Considering his college statline, that shouldn’t have been too surprising. Although he started 120 games in his college career, Caruso didn’t average more than 9.1 points per game in any season. 
But somehow, Caruso evolved from an undrafted, overlooked rookie to a beloved, electrifying NBA player earning valuable minutes on a title-contending Los Angeles Lakers team, all while becoming one of the internet’s favorite NBA players. 
Caruso’s evolution is so significant, in fact, that I think the “Bald Mamba” provides the exact spark the Lakers need to propel them to an NBA championship this year (if the Finals even happens). 
Heading into this season, the whole league was aware the Lakers would be competing for a title after adding Anthony Davis to their roster. Up until the coronavirus suspended regular season play, the Lakers were meeting almost all expectations, holding the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference for almost the entire season while a number of other contenders — the L.A. Clippers, Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets — lagged behind. 
But though Davis and LeBron James have been almost unstoppable, questions still surrounded the rest of the team. 
Kyle Kuzma has seemingly regressed since last season, Danny Green is a one-dimensional shooter, Rajon Rondo can’t shoot at all, Avery Bradley is limited offensively, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is inconsistent and big men Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee are aging and prone to fouling. It’s not hard to see why fans doubt the Lakers’ supporting cast at times.
This is why Caruso has been able to shine as a young role player who gives the Lakers energy on both ends of the floor. Caruso plays with constant hustle; he’s pesky and smothering on defense and a capable shooter and ball handler on offense. 
These aspects of his game are not new by any means. In reality, Caruso has been a particularly outstanding role player ever since his days as an Aggie.
Instead of stuffing the stat sheet with dominant scoring, Caruso became Texas A&M’s all-time leader in steals and assists, earning the 2015-16 All-SEC Defensive Player of the Year and an All-SEC Second Team selection in the process.
Though he was just the fourth-leading scorer on the team, his tenacity and court vision made him a major factor in the Aggies’ 2016 NCAA Tournament run.
Caruso’s time at Texas A&M molded him into a player who provides value in numerous ways for the Lakers now. Although it did not lead to the flashy stats that would have gotten him drafted, it is surely paying off today as he has found his niche with the Lakers.
Caruso’s positive impact on the team not only manifests itself through his intangibles but also through advanced statistics. Currently, Caruso has the third highest real plus-minus on the Lakers, behind only Davis and James. (According to ESPN, real plus-minus is an advanced statistic that “estimates how many points each player adds or subtracts, on average, to his team’s net scoring margin for each 100 possessions played.”) Caruso also has the 20th best defensive real plus-minus in the entire league, which is a true testament to his defending abilities. 
In addition, Caruso proves his value while he is on the court through his season net rating of 10.3. (Net rating measures the team’s point differential while the player is on the court; the higher it is, the better.) 
This number may actually be Caruso’s most significant stat because it is tied for the highest on the team with Lebron. Caruso’s net rating alone should demonstrate just how impactful he is when he is on the floor, especially since he doesn’t just play in junk time. 
Caruso also provides energy and excitement through his powerful dunks and flashy highlights. Every time Caruso rises to throw it down, the whole crowd seems to stand on its feet. In fact, every time it happens, the highlight almost always inevitably finds its way onto ESPN. 
The truth is that Caruso is one of the Lakers’ most popular players even though he plays on the same team as superstars like LeBron and Davis. Part of the reason that Caruso is so hyped stems from the fact that he looks nothing like your typical NBA player. 
At 26 years old, Caruso looks like your everyday white guy and is already showing signs of baldness on the top of his head that he can’t hide with his signature white headband. People find it hilarious that someone who looks the way he does is capable of delivering show-stopping dunks and playing at such a high level. As a result of his nonexistent hairline and his fierce play style, fans have affectionately nicknamed him “The Bald Eagle.” 
The hype and energy surrounding Caruso is by no means a distraction to himself or the team. Rather, it is contagious and has given the Lakers’ bench life. No other player on the squad has the same kind of vitality and spirit that Caruso does, which further proves his value to the team and should be a positive factor in the playoffs, where the intensity reaches a whole different level. 
All of these things contributed to Caruso’s rise from undrafted rookie to a reliable rotation player with a weirdly massive internet following. Don’t get me wrong, Caruso is still young and needs to develop further, but you can’t deny the enthusiasm and buzz his persona offers. The legend of Alex Caruso just needs one more thing: a championship ring. And from what he’s contributed to the Lakers so far, it’s clear that Caruso has what it takes to help the Lakers get one.

“Everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has those days. Everybody knows what I’m talking about. Eh-eh-everybody gets that way.”
Hannah Montana wasn’t lying when she penned these lyrics in 2007, and her words ring truer than ever as we fend off this collective depressive social isolation. Everybody is having those days right now, and for the foreseeable future, we still have many of those days to come.
Despite how cringe-worthy that opening might have been, it brought a genuine smile to my face to write it out and imagine 90% of people stopping right about there. Having a sense of humor is about all we can do in times like these. I mean, hell, almost all other forms of distraction have been canceled or postponed for at least another month or two. 
Comedy has always been a go-to coping mechanism for many — and for good reason. If you’re someone who laughs or makes jokes when you’re going through something, you already know what I’m talking about. The very essence of comedy is about taking the wrong parts of life and finding the silver lining that doesn’t occur to us right off the bat.
So much of good comedy is about pain, mistakes and honest reflection of the two. It’s not about blocking out the pain or ignoring your feelings — it’s quite the opposite. Good comedy forces us to embrace the pain and glean the understanding that allows us to grow from it or not. There’s so much good material in stunted growth. 
Good comedy is also hearty and soulful. The pleasure you feel from it extends far beyond the slight involuntary chuckle you make when understanding a joke. Good comedy induces a deeper, more cathartic pleasure in your chest and throughout your body, similar to that evoked by listening to a great jazz or blues composition. It’s the sensation of healing and understanding that makes a work of art meaningful.
Whenever I try to compile a list of my all-time favorite stand-ups, I find it’s littered with people who make me feel less alone in this world more than people who purely make me laugh — although there’s usually a ton of overlap. Our heartiest laughs don’t usually come from comedy that thrives on simple, easily digestible concepts that don’t move or challenge us. They come from the well of deep pain and worldly curiosity that we don’t often express in our daily interactions.
David Isaacs, a professor in the School of Cinematic Arts and longtime comedy writer for shows like “M*A*S*H*” and “Frazier,” would always repeat this mantra to our writing class: Tragedy plus time equals comedy. I’m still not sure where this phrase originated, but it’s one of the most essential rules in the creation of good comedy. 
If there’s one positive thing about the conditions we’re living in, it’s that they’re forcing us to reconsider what’s important and necessary and what’s not. I myself have started to wonder why I spent so much time caring about things that are truly harmless and insignificant in the grand scheme of life. I’ve also started to think about things I should have been focusing on more this entire time — like my future and my loved ones.
We can only hope that other people will have these revelations as well. When the world kicks back into gear, it’s truly not worth having an uptight demeanor about everyone and everything. If something in the world really bothers you, go and do something about it — be the change that you want to see. Don’t internalize and wallow in the things that upset you, and don’t put the weight of the world upon your shoulders. It will keep on spinning with or without your concern from afar.
To tell the truth, there’s really nothing all that funny about a global pandemic threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions around the globe. But it is funny to think that TSA wouldn’t let me bring toothpaste on a plane for 13 years, only to toss the rule aside without a second thought about two weeks ago. 
I guess what I’m trying to say here is this: Try to have a sense of humor about things. Laugh more, write more, talk to the people around you — from a safe distance of at least 6 feet of course. This coronavirus panic won’t go on forever. Unfortunately, the trials and tribulations of life will, and the least we can all do is have a laugh about them.

While the MatchSC survey has clear quarantine motifs scattered throughout — from the Corona bottle on its first page to the team’s “Fight on(line)” message — the idea was born long before the first case of the coronavirus emerged. 
It started last summer in a $6 million mansion near Palo Alto collectively referred to as “The Habitat.” Fifteen people, primarily entrepreneurs and creators from USC and Stanford, spent the summer hot-tubbing with the USC club wrestling team, tinkering with startups and avoiding noise complaints from their neighbors — who happened to include Walmart’s founding family. 
“People lived in closets, people lived under the stairs — it was just this big hacker house,” said Markie Wagner, one of the quiz’s developers. “It was a lot of spitballing ideas, a lot of hanging out.”
But underneath the colorful experience was an experiment. Wagner said that it was their first real-life exploration of community and match-making.
“Could you build a tight-knit community out of people who didn’t know each other at all?” said Wagner, a junior majoring in computer science at Stanford who previously attended USC. “It was pretty intentional who was brought into the house.”
Since then, more than 5,000 students who indicated interest in finding a “Platonic (Work from HOMIE)” or “romantic” soulmate were emailed their matches in waves Tuesday night through Wednesday after signing up for MatchSC, a five-minute matching quiz created by “bored Trojans stuck at home.” 
Starting March 24, the quiz opened for a week and involved a series of questions ranging from the quiz-taker’s gender identity to their USC pet peeve. While some questions had students indicate their level of agreement with statements like “it’s very important to help the people around me,” others were more lighthearted — prompting students to select their “biggest flex” from options like “not having ‘public figure’ in my Instagram bio” or “Soundcloud mixtape on the come up. Just watch.”
“I thought the questions were really funny,” said Darren Tsai, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “Some of the questions were framed in a way or the question itself was not really representative of somebody’s personality … but for the most part it was pretty fun to fill out. There were some that kind of threw me off, though, like ‘On a scale of one to 10, how kinky would you say you were?’ I was not expecting to see that one.”
The MatchSC team comprises a group of friends — Grant Stenger, Nat Redfern, Melisa Seah and Wagner — most of whom met at USC during the 2017-18 school year and have previously worked together on projects like Lavalab, USC’s start-up incubator. 
While Redfern, Stegner and Wagner spent their summer days interning in the Bay Area and their nights at the mansion, Seah, a December 2019 graduate, was experimenting with community-building through High Table, a startup professional networking community. The startup community, incubated through Harvard’s Innovation Labs, hosts 15 meals from New York to Los Angeles and brings together a dynamic table of people unlikely to meet otherwise. 
The community experiments merged this spring when Wagner invited Seah to join the MatchSC team. Several team members had conducted prior academic research on building friendships and meaningful relationships. 
Wagner said that she found three important aspects in determining whether a deep relationship would form: physical proximity, mutual friends and compatibility in personality and values. An interest in finding ways for people to escape loneliness and feel connected combined with the realization that many dating apps did not consider these components sparked the idea to test a matching service at USC. 
“There was research backing all three of those different things, so we were interested in what ways could we try and test out some of those hypotheses and try to create matches that were better than what might be done on some traditional social media or dating app in a fun side-project way,” Wagner said. 
Much of the original idea was started in the house, Stenger said, and after working on the project throughout the school year, they planned to launch it around Valentine’s Day. Exams got in the way, and, coincidentally, the timing of the release seems to have worked in their favor. 
“All this [coronavirus] stuff hit and we were like, ‘OK, people are now genuinely really bored, now we can help connect people that are just looking for something to do,’” said Stenger, a junior majoring in applied and computational mathematics. “It’s a good way to bring people back to the campus ethos and the great atmosphere … The timing worked out well even though it was kind of an accident.”
The team believes their algorithm, which is based on thoroughly researched psychological profiles and inspired by famous tests like the Big Five Personality Test and Schwartz Value Survey, gives MatchSC the potential to create effective connections in the age of quarantine. 
“[Students] can trust the algorithm, it’s pretty research-backed and not whipped out of a hat,” said Wagner, who has had experience building AI algorithms through a past internship at Google. “There’s a lot of thoughtfulness that has gone into the algorithm itself.”
Stegner said that certain parameters, like gender identity and sexuality preferences, take priority in the algorithm. Other factors carry less weight but are still highly considered: A Leo will be more likely to get another Leo, a person who eats a lot of fast food will be more likely to get someone who eats a lot of fast food. 
“Someone who really enjoys saving the world will probably enjoy someone else who will also enjoy saving the world,” said Redfern, a junior majoring in cognitive science. “Even if you answered juice box as your favorite drink, that’s not going to make a huge difference between one match and another, but we’re probably going to consider it. It’s going to be in there, just a little bit, but maybe location or major might matter significantly more.”
If a person shared their Instagram or zip code, those factors could come into play as well. Stegner said a geographic function puts in the zip codes to minimize the total distance between people. 
While the team stands behind their quiz, some respondents were more skeptical.
“It’s like that thing with those bootleg ‘Harry Potter’ sorting house quizzes where there’s like four options and each option is distinctly like, you know, what house it’s trying to get at,” said Ariann Barker, a freshman majoring in writing for film and television. “That scale of one to 10 question that was like … ‘do you believe that people should be equal’ or something like that — imagine putting anything less than 10 and having to confront that, like having a quiz like that be like, ‘Oh yeah, are you a racist or a homophobe?’”
Wagner said that once responses closed Sunday, the team realized there was a lopsided dating pool, and they had to adjust the algorithm to make sure all genders and sexualities were being matched as optimally as possible. Along with filtering out responses made by fake emails, this led to a delay in sending the matches.
“We were up all night,” Wagner said. “We didn’t really know what the data was gonna look like until we closed the survey on Sunday. Turns out we needed more than one day to account for all the shifts in data. We just wanted to give better matches that we felt were more rigorous and optimal than just sending out random matches.”
Since results have been released, Wagner said she has already heard some funny stories, like the algorithm matching one respondent with their “hookup’s roommate,” and said she is open to MatchSC possibly continuing in the future. 
“Originally it was kind of like a one-off quirky thing, and I think it probably will be, but people have really enjoyed it … sometimes these things become a tradition on campus,” Stegner said. “It could be cool to run it again.”

When the TFE Times released its 2020 report on the best graduate accounting programs in the country in January, faculty and students in the Leventhal School of Accounting were unsurprised that USC came in first.
TFE Times, a popular academia site that publishes university rankings each January, bases rankings on factors such as mean GMAT scores, starting salary of graduates and acceptance rate. 
Leventhal Dean William Holder said the ranking reflects the school’s hardworking students and faculty and their commitment to excellence. 
“One of the things you learn when you get in a position like mine is how many people it takes dedicated to a common proposition to achieve much of anything,” Holder said. “We’re so fortunate to have that here.”
Students in Leventhal’s graduate programs said that the ranking is well-deserved. Sandy Situ, a senior majoring in accounting while pursuing a master’s degree in business taxation, said Leventhal’s commitment to connecting with students even after graduation keeps the school up to par with what accounting firms are looking for in new recruits. 
“Leventhal consults with the Big Four accounting firms,” Situ said. “They have student representatives who have gone there, who started working, and they come back every year, and they have some sort of a meeting or conference just to update their curriculum.” 
Other graduate students echoed this sentiment, adding that the professors in Leventhal often go above and beyond the call of duty by meeting with students outside of office hours or keeping in touch as friends even after the end of the semester. 
John Owens, the academic director of the master’s in accounting with data and analytics and a professor of the practice at Marshall School of Business, said that professors take particular personal interest in their students at Leventhal, which fosters a more open learning environment. 
“A common phrase you hear in classes at Leventhal is that we teach students to be comfortable being uncomfortable,” Owens said. “And we want them to really be out there learning to be leading edge thinkers and to be the ideal people for their companies a few years down the road when they come out.”
Juliette Smotrys, a graduate student studying business taxation, also said faculty in Leventhal are particularly helpful and constantly encourage her and other students to do their best work by introducing them to new skill sets to help with their research as future tax professionals. 
“We have such a wonderful set of professors and staff that really do help us to succeed and give us all the resources necessary to really propel us forward in our careers,” Smotrys said.
Michael Leong, a graduate student studying accounting, said accounting classes at other universities cannot compare to those offered by Leventhal. 
“I’m very happy and content with all the professors that I’ve met and the knowledge that I’ve gained from each of the classes,” Leong said. “I think that a lot of the classes that I was offered here would definitely not be offered at other universities or even at my undergraduate institution.”
Owens echoed these sentiments, stating that Leventhal has unparalleled access to leaders in business that few other schools can compare to.
“I regularly have the CFOs of Disney and Amgen and Netflix and Capital Group and others come to my classes, and those people are highly interactive with the classes,” Owens said. 
Leventhal also offers a high caliber of financial support from its alumni, something Holder said has helped build its positive reputation over the 41 years since the school was established in Marshall. 
“We know we could not be nearly as successful in recruiting students and in delivering the educational experience [without our alumni],” Holder said. “Those alums have been extraordinarily generous in endowing scholarships. They’ve also been very generous in endowing chairs and professorships for our faculty. Those are absolutely essential to recruiting world class faculty.”
Leventhal offers full-time master’s programs in accounting, business taxation and accounting with an emphasis on data analytics. Starting Fall 2020, the school will also offer business taxation with an emphasis on data analytics, a program that Associate Dean for Leventhal’s Graduate Accounting Programs Shirley Maxey called cutting-edge.
“Moving to these new elements, the school has, in the last five years, attracted some amazing academics who are known throughout the educational and professional communities,” Maxey said. “That helps us stay on top of what’s happening.”
Holder and Maxey both expressed hope that Leventhal will continue to reflect its No. 1 ranking through the excellence of its students and faculty members. 
“It’s nice to see [the rankings], and it’s rewarding to see them,” Holder said. “It conveys to us that we seem to be on the right track, and it makes us have even loftier aspirations for the future.”
