With Amazon’s Transparent and Netflix’s House of Cards winning big at this past Sunday’s Golden Globes, and Community announcing its release date after having transferred from NBC to Yahoo, the Internet show buzz has reached an all-time high. These significant steps forward have turned plenty of heads; there is a deluge of articles hitting the web this week declaring this a transition period for the genre of television. However, it is difficult to envision a total revolution in the landscape of television. It’s much more likely that this is simply the birth of a different branch of entertainment.
Online game entertainment certainly overlaps with the world of television. Online shows have thus far been grouped with traditional television shows at award shows. This is not that difficult to understand. Online shows, after all, come in episodic format like television shows, and shows like Arrested Development and Community have easily jumped from network television to online formats. It can be argued, however, that in making the switch, shows become something different. The fact that fictional universes have made the jump from film to the small screen (and vice versa) isn’t used as evidence that these are actually the same medium, but rather, two connected ones. Their similarities make them related, but distinct, forms of entertainment. The same could be argued about television and online shows.
For example, that fact that online shows are released in episodes is misleading. This is especially true with shows that are released in binge-friendly piles of episodes. At what point while watching eight episodes of House of Cards does the show really become a 10-hour long film? Some shows are actually better viewed in one sitting. The fourth season of Arrested Development came out to mixed reviews for its meandering plot. The season’s arc contained a series of threads that were best understood when viewed all together. Showrunner Mitchell Hurwitz seems to have been ahead of the game when it came to understanding the potential for art that the online format offers — something that was impossible when the show originally ran on network television in the early 2000s.
The release of all episodes at once offers a wealth of possibilities that have not been fully explored as of yet. Properly executed, one of these shows could boil down to a 10-hour monolith of content that doesn’t require fumbling through the rows of a dark movie theater to go on the fifth bathroom break of the day, or waiting weeks at a time for the next chapter to be released. Plots can be more complex with a canvas like this, and so can jokes. A joke can be set up in episode two and left alone to only pay off in the finale. This can be done with much more confidence when the finale is probably being watched a few hours later, as opposed to a few weeks, after the second episode.
Another major strength of platforms like Netflix or Amazon is the ability to present these large chunks of content without the constant breaks for commercials. While watching on traditional television, periodic commercial breaks are expected. But once the content goes online, the expectations change. Commercials become much more burdensome when the viewer has the ability to hit play or pause. When network television posts its episodes online, they are usually presented with commercials between the acts. This strategy is not going anywhere. Yahoo has announced that this would be the strategy with new episodes of Community. Whenever websites remove commercials and allow for more streamlined viewing, however, things become much more immersive. It gets much easier to lose track of time and watch seven episodes in a row for a more cohesive viewing experience.
The line between television and online shows is far from clear, but one could argue that it’s even less clear than the one between film and television. TV’s line with movies has become increasingly blurred over time, while its boundary between online shows has grown more distinct. One major event that helped to further muddle the line between TV and film has been the fallout of the Sony hacking scandal. After threats of violence were made preceding the release of The Interview, Sony eventually released the film online. It made $31 million, a huge win for a film whose $44 million budget seemed at risk of becoming a sunk cost after major cinemas pulled out of showing it. It is difficult to tell how much of the success was due to the major controversy that before it, but it certainly had something to do with it. There is definitely something to be said of the success The Interview found, however, and no doubt the ever hungry studios will attempt to explore the possibilities of online films. Michael Lynton declared as much when he said Sony would “learn from [the] experience and innovate [their] business together.”
If major studios begin to create scripted films specifically for online release, it will only serve to muddle the waters further. TV movies, online movies, TV-movie crossovers and online-TV crossovers have already all happened and will only happen more and more as these hybrids prove to be profitable. While boundaries are being crossed more than ever before, however, it is also clear that online shows are heading in a direction all their own.

Imagine the most high-end cafe you can think of. Now imagine a culinary boutique, which also provides a wide selection of delectable charms. Combine these elements, and you might conjure an image of GC Marketplace, located in Hollywood Hills.
Founded by Gary Arabia, GC Marketplace is a fairly new restaurant that offers a unique dining experience. Not only does the restaurant offer high-end meals, customers might also pay the restaurant a visit to purchase pastries, buy cheese, taste wine or for a quick drink at the coffee bar.
The premise of the restaurant is ambitious; however, crucial dining aspects, such as communication are lost amid the restaurant’s features.
The exterior of the restaurant is just as intriguing as the premise; one cannot drive down Cahuenga Boulevard without setting his eyes on the silver, sleek building. Likewise, the interior layout of the restaurant seems less like a traditional restaurant and more like a cosmetics store. The interior layout, combined with the natural lighting and the simple yet sophisticated decor contributes to the restaurant’s posh atmosphere. Though customers are given the freedom to sit inside or outside, the interior of the restaurant provides one with the complete GC Marketplace experience.
The music playing throughout restaurant serves as a reminder that the restaurant is just as fitting for casual affairs as it is for formal, though the food and decor might lead one to believe otherwise. The volume is loud enough to drown out other customers’ noises, but not too loud to interfere with conversations with dining companions. Though the music is a comforting touch to the atmosphere, it also makes it difficult to communicate with the staff.
For the most part, the staff is ready to help. However, given the restaurant’s spacious environment, customers will be put off if they are not given immediate attention. Restaurants such as GC Marketplace require a staff that is quick and attentive to everyone as soon as they walk through the door because basic components, such as figuring out whether one needs to walk to the back register or proceed to sit wherever they please, become unclear. When the staff helps, they do so with sincere smiles and helpful suggestions, but the music drowns out their quiet voices, making for awkward moments.
Like any restaurant, GC Marketplace’s primary focus should be the meals. The menu provides a vast array of dishes. Customers might be pleased to choose from French, Italian, Thai, Greek and American meals, and then watch the chefs prepare their food as they sit and wait. The meals were ready within five minutes, which might seem more appealing to those who prefer to dine at home rather than in a restaurant. Whether one prefers upscale cuisine or is in the mood for a hamburger and fries, the menu provides a wide range of food suitable for anyone’s taste. The price to portion ratio might be the greatest factor keeping GC Marketplace from being a restaurant to go to less frequently than often. However, given the restaurant’s atmosphere and amenities, one will not necessarily find themselves asking for more from GC Marketplace.
With a menu with eclectic selections, it is difficult to see where GC Marketplace goes wrong. The restaurant itself has plentiful of features and the menu has a wide range of choices. Both factors contribute to an underlying theme of quantity and ambition, which transitions to the meals. Take the panang curry, for example. The amount of sauce poured over the vegetables and tofu soon dismiss the initial delectableness of the panang curry. The sauce furnishes the meal with an acquired, albeit zesty kick. Perhaps too much of a kick. Perhaps more of a kick-from-a-horse-to-the-chest kind of kick. The sauce makes for a strong impact that can be balanced with more use of basic components such as vegetables and tofu, which are cooked to a delightfully warm temperature.
Evidently, GC Marketplace thrives with ambitious ideas and notable executions. GC Marketplace’s many features are enjoyable to some, though they remain off-putting to customers who prefer simplicity. Perhaps a trimming of ideas would make for a more intricate and cohesive restaurant experience. Perhaps if more emphasis was placed onto the basic components such as the meals rather than on maintaining an already-sleek atmosphere, the dining experience could be more favorable.
Whether one is in the mood for a quick pastry and coffee, or to wine and dine, GC Marketplace is sure to provide all customers with a memorable, unique experience that is difficult to encounter elsewhere. Restaurants such as GC Marketplace are in no way short of ideas, but the experience can only be strengthened once the founders recognize the age-old question: how much is too much?
GC Marketplace is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday through Saturday, and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sundays. It is located at 3315 Cahuenga Blvd. W.

The first sight upon entering the samurai exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is that of three warriors, charging into battle on horseback, both man and beast adorned with extravagant armor. Dramatic yet unobtrusive red light bathes the 140 pieces of samurai war regalia, creating an intense and lavish atmosphere. This powerful visual sets the tone for the whole exhibit. “Samurai: Japanese Armor from the Ann and Gabriel Barbier-Mueller Collection” is both striking and deeply interesting, with the ornate pieces of armor and weaponry accompanied by details of Japan’s history and culture.
The pieces themselves are impressive, with the armor on display acting not only as physical protection, but also as decoration and fanfare. Intricate detail, designed to allow more fluid movement than pure metal could, and elegant gold and red pieces create quite the arresting spectacle. The objects range from human armor, to horse saddles and masks carved to look like dragon heads, to helmets adorned with antlers. These helmets, while initially odd to observe, have an interesting story. Labeled an “Eboshi-shaped helmet,” it was a traditional headdress presented to young samurai warriors at the age of 12 as part of a coming-of-age ceremony. Gold lacquer coats the horns, adding to the extravagant effect.
The history of the samurai warrior is also explained through short paragraphs scattered throughout the exhibition. The role of the samurai came into existence after Japan put an end to obligatory military service in 792. This led to a more private mode of defense, and landowners employed their own forces for defense and protection of their land. Thus, the samurai class was born.
The samurais were more than just soldiers for provincial landowners however. The term samurai itself came to identify warriors who were skilled and educated and often joined Japan’s intellectual elite. Following the dissolution of the samurai class, many went on to hold positions in administration and government.
The costume or armor of a samurai warrior was the main identifiable symbol of his status. The armor was made up of three key components: a helmet or kabuto, a mask or mengu, and the chest armor or dõ. Shoulder guards, sleeves, a skirt, thigh protection and shin guards completed the ensemble that was, despite its ornateness, very light in comparison to most Western armor at the time. Materials used included iron, brocade, leather, lace and precious metals, and the armor took several months to produce. One of the pieces showcased from this period is a full suit of armor, equipped with elaborate gold leaf decorations on the helmet, a long, traditionally curved gold sword and a fan painted with an image of the Japanese flag. The rarity of full suits of armor like this certainly makes the exhibition unique and exceptional. As previously stated, however, the armor was as much a decorative piece of fashion as physical protection in battle, and never was this truer than in the peaceful Edo period between 1615 and 1868. The samurai did not lose their elite status during this period and became bureaucrats instead. It was unclear to the samurai whether this state of peace would last, and so they remained in battle-ready condition, which involved maintaining their armor as well. During this time, the armor was used for pageantry, decoration and exposition, for example in parades and processions. One example of this in the exhibition is the “The Armor of the Okegawadō Type,” featuring gilt decorations that reach six feet and convey the prestige and glamour of the samurai warrior. The exhibition itself is laid out somewhat like an elegant, stately fashion show, capturing the formal and dignified image of samurai culture. Another piece is the helmet which represents the flaming jewel. The helmet is decorated with metallic flames and has gold and bronze embellishments, adding to the luxurious image of the armor.
One of the highlights of the exhibition is a timeline of events in Japan and the West, thus providing an insight into the country’s overall history as well as the samurai culture. Key examples include the introduction of Buddhism in Japan around 552, very close to the year when Christianity was recognized in the Roman Empire in 313.
Together, the visual and literary elements of the exhibition provide a comprehensive overview of samurai culture, regalia and history. The exhibit only takes up one small room, and the information is presented in digestible sections, with the pieces well-spaced to avoid any sense of overcrowding. The color scheme clearly centers on red, the color of the sun in Japanese lore and the image on their flag. This sets a tone of elegance and lavishness alongside warfare and bloodshed, which is the essence of samurai culture. This exhibition is definitely worth a look if you are planning on paying LACMA a visit -— it is quick to explore and provides and fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture and history.
“Samurai: Japanese Armor from the Ann and Gabriel Barbier-Mueller Collection” will be available to view at LACMA until Feb. 1.

The recent merciless massacre at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo has sparked a global narrative of a range of topics, including free speech, religious stratification and international dialogue on acceptance. A particular thread of the narrative that calls for attention is the relationship between those who committed the heinous crime and Islam. Let it be clear that neither Islam nor Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of a villainous few.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
Media mogul Rupert Murdoch stated that all Muslims should be held accountable for the tragedy in Paris, tweeting, “Maybe most Moslems [sic] peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.” Murdoch’s methodology behind this statement is illogical. Blaming Muslims for violence disrespects religion. Those who stepped into Charlie Hebdo and killed staffers were not associated with any religion. No religion condones the killing of innocent, unarmed civilians. Instead, the cowards who ended the lives of those who spoke out, acted on their own accord. Furthermore, to say that Islam should be held accountable is to say adherents are the cause of crime; the projection of guilt on a population based on the deeds of a few denies Muslims fundamental agency. As author J.K. Rowling astutely replied to Murdoch, “I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I’ll auto-excommunicate.” Actor Aziz Ansari also shared sentiments, tweeting, “Are you responsible for the evil sh-t all Christians do or just the insane amount of evil you yourself contribute to?”
The tragedy at Charlie Hebdo underscores the risk of adverse attitudes and actions toward those who are different, or as literary theorist Edward Said would say, “the other.” The two suspects, now deceased, should not be categorized with Islam. The guard on duty that day who was also tragically killed was a practicing Muslim. The attackers clearly did not discriminate against their targets, just anybody associated with Charlie Hebdo. Yet, despite all that, there still exists a threat of violence toward Muslims as retaliation for what transpired. No one condones the massacre. Muslims not only in France but across the world would stand against such atrocities.
Many, particularly those in American media, have characterized and described Charlie Hebdo as a “satirical magazine.” Charlie Hebdo is satire, but make no mistake; it is not Jon Stewart. Charlie Hebdo is revered for its unfiltered, honest take on subjects and issues but is, at times, extremely racist and prejudiced. It utilizes stereotypes, slurs and derogatory epithets to make points. Though one might disagree with what the magazine says, they cannot disagree with its right to say it. What Charlie Hebdo publishes and prints is a fundamental right that must be kept, despite its often divisive nature.
The “Je Suis Charlie” campaign, which is French for “I am Charlie,” has taken the world by storm. Millions have poured out to streets across the globe in support of Charlie Hebdo, and rightfully so. It is important, however, to understand that declaring “Je Suis Charlie” does not mean one necessarily supports all the viewpoints expressed by the magazine, but you support the fundamental right for the publication to speak out, print and voice their opinion without repercussion. Simply put, Charlie Hebdo is comedy, and as Jon Stewart noted after the attacks, comedy shouldn’t be “an act of courage.” It is meant to entertain and amid all the laughter, the satire makes a point. Whether you agree with the humor is a discussion in and of itself, but the idea being made is not to make a scapegoat out of the those you may not know. Those who hold views similar to Rupert Murdoch are ignorant of Islam and lack the subtlety that encompass acceptance and understanding. It is dangerous to make Islam a scapegoat, and we should open the discourse in society on how those who differ from us are viewed and treated.

“No religion condones the killing of innocent, unarmed civilians. Instead, the cowards who ended the lives of those who spoke out, acted on their own accord.”
+++
Then why is the Qur’an, hadiths and Sunna filled with admonitions to kill infidels?  Do you have any idea what you are writing about?
+++
There is not a day goes by that a Muslim does not quote chapter and verse from the Qur’an as justification for murder of others.  But let’s bury our heads in the sand and pretend otherwise, OK?
“Those who stepped into Charlie Hebdo and killed staffers were not associated with any religion.”
+++
And I am the tooth fairy.
“Blaming Muslims for violence disrespects religion.”
+++
No, Islam disrespects all other religions.
“Let it be clear that neither Islam nor Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of a villainous few.”
+++
How many barbaric attacks do Muslims need to commit before we realize there IS a connection between Islam, Islam’s core tenets and terrorism?
+++
Muslims are the only people at war with every other religion as well as internecine warfare.  But, gosh, let’s ignore this reality, OK?
23% of the worlds population is Muslim (according to Pew) so referring to 1.6 BILLION people as though we are all the same makes you sound ignorant.
Do you know where the majority of the worlds Muslims are? Indonesia and India. 
And did you know that Muslim jihadists killed 70 million Hindus in their conquest of southern Asia?  (Rhetorical question.)
If I were to count all the lives that have been taken at the hands of “Christians” it would be a greater number but it would be absurd to lump all Christians together.
Really?  And how do you know that?  You’re making it up because you think with your gut not with your head and if your gut tells you it is so, then it must be so.
+++
Truth be told Christians have been responsible for countless deaths.  No denying that.
+++
But Christ was a man of peace, a man who turned the other cheek and taught love for one’s neighbors.  Mohammed raped, enslaved, pillaged and tortured.
+++
If you want to believe in fairy tales then go for it.  It’s no skin off my back.  But if you really believe that Christianity is like Islam, that good practicing Christians are like devout Muslims then your gut really is your brain and your brain share many similarities with a cabbage.
I believe it to be so because Christianity has existed for hundreds of years longer than Islam and the population of Christians has always been larger than the population of Muslims. “Fairy tales” aside, my point was that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, the majority are not subscribing to violence. There are violent people in this world and some of them are Muslim. Clearly you are an expert on Islam.
Soleil, If we were assuming raw statistics were the only factor then you would be correct, but there are many variables involved.
+++
Since Islam is a violent, aggressive, expansionist ideology it is also likely this factor sways the results towards Muslims murdering more than Christians.
+++
In any case this is something we will never know the answer to.  There are too many variables and too much water under the bridge.
+++
But what we do know is that when Christians kill they have sinned, but when Muslims kill in the act of Jihad (spreading Islam) then they are martyrs promised virgins in paradise.  This is likely the most important factor and likely weighs the scale in a meaningful way against Muslims and their murderous ways.
Soleil, if the majority of Muslims do not subscribe to violence, why does this majority celebrate whenever Jihadist terrorists succeed in killing large numbers? Why does this majority not expose those in their midst who preach violent Jihad? Why does this majority not expose the terrorist training camps and facilities in their midst? Why is this majority’s first reaction to a terrorist act always to complain about an anti-Islamic backlash rather than to condemn the terrorist act and express solidarity with the attacked? If YOU do not subscribe to violence, why did YOU attempt to blame the American military for causing the terrorist attack (see above)?
Soleil, Christianity has evolved since the Crusades. Unfortunately, Islam is stuck in the 15th Century.
Not all Muslims are the same other then that they believe in a supremacist, hate-filled, sadistic ideology.
Responsibility is not a binary phenomenon. While they may not have pulled the triggers or detonated the bombs, many people celebrated the terrorist acts of the last 15 years. Many people knew that violent radicalism was being promoted in the places where they pray but they said nothing. The reality is that the vast majority of such people claim to be Moslem. It is self-destructive to ignore reality. The question is what is to be done with that reality that is helpful, legal and fair. 
You say: “Many people knew that violent radicalism was being promoted in the places where they pray but they said nothing.”
Would you also hold the population of the United States responsible for the acts of warfare and aggression that its military commits throughout the world? Your reasoning sounds the same as the terrorists’.
Soleil, if by “acts of warfare” you mean the liberation of Europe in the 1940’s, the liberation of the Pacific in the 1940’s, the attempted liberation of Korea in the 1950’s, the attempted liberation of South Vietnam in the 1960’s, the liberation of Kuwait in the 1990’s, the attempted liberation of Iraq in the 2000’s and the liberation of Afghanistan in the 2000’s through restrained military engagements conforming to the norms of international conventions: then yes, the population of the United States is responsible for those acts and you’re welcome. If you can name an instance in which Jihadist terrorism was employed to resist and turn back a totalitarian regime or insurgency that was in the process of depriving hundreds of thousands of people of their individual liberties and their national sovereignty with uniformed troops and without targeting defenseless civilians: then confusing the two is understandable, otherwise it’s simply baffling.
If by “acts of warfare” you mean the handful of covert operations carried out by U.S. Presidents over the past century: then no, the population of the U.S. isn’t responsible for acts it doesn’t know about and doesn’t approve through the Republic’s due process.
If by “aggression” you mean military interventions that aimed primarily to capture treasure and territory for the U.S. or to impose an unwelcome totalitarian or sectarian government upon already-free people: then your question is a non-sequitur. You must be talking about the military of Russia, Syria, Hamas, Hezbollah, Daesh, Al Qaida or AQAP.

For some time now, York school district in Pennsylvania has been marred by academic and financial difficulties. According to National Public Radio, York students perform the worst on tests out of the state’s 500 school districts. Eighty-four percent of York students live in “poor households,” and the economy has not grown with the national standard. This prompted the state to intervene in 2012, proposing that a for-profit company, Charters USA, control the school district. With a decision that will be announced sometime in the upcoming weeks, this potential corporate inclusion demonstrates Pennsylvania’s inability to fix its academic turmoil.
Though Charters USA, a company with ties to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, manages 70 schools in seven states, it is not an organization based on nurturing. Rather, the basis of Charters USA is profit. A McKinsey Report states that privatized education generates $1.1 trillion in revenue. So even if the company’s website boasts of caring about students on an individual level and experienced educators, when the focus is on earning money, education loses its pure purpose to help students grow. Education based in business also means the educators are not responsible to the public; all decisions are made by the corporation detached from the people they are supposed to be serving.
Additionally, studies have found that education has not necessarily improved with the proliferation of charter schools. A CREDO study by Stanford University compared statistics of charter schools to that of public schools for four years, and found academic performance to be around the same. In York district specifically, several independent charter schools can be found. According to NPR, two are the highest achieving in the suburban area, while one had to be shut down due to even lower test scores. Further specific incidences of charter schools failing to revive education should alarm Pennsylvanian government officials. Schools in Ohio experienced lower performance in all school subjects, while Texas charters reported fewer graduating students in their 2012 graduating class. Quite apparently, privatization of education is not an absolute solution to the education problem.
At the root of that education problem lies funding cuts for public schools. State funding, which comes from taxes has received a 15 percent cut since Gov. Tom Corbett took office, according to the Pennsylvania State Education Association. This is due to corporations neglecting to pay their taxes, causing a decrease in fund circulation. Tax dollars are funneled elsewhere, ignoring the teachers with low salaries and schools with dilapidated technology and resources. Allowing Charters USA to take over York is publicly shaming the school district, when in actuality, they are not at fault. On the contrary, the state has set up York for failure, as it is not able to meet its demands with the amount of money given.
The shame is also felt by the very people who care deeply about the school district, and are aware of its depleted financial resources. Ashlee DeSantis, a high school senior, told NPR, “We care about our school, we love our school and we love public school. We don’t want receivership [placement of custodial responsibility in others] to happen here.” Corporate takeover strikes down an already solid community of passionate people. It’s an environment that they cannot engineer.
There are many ways that the public school system can be improved, and it starts with abandoning the development of charter schools. These business endeavors have exhibited trivial success and neglected to solve the problem from its genesis, lack of funding. Instead, Charters USA will only messily patch York’s problems and demean its community.
As the Commonwealth State, Pennsylvania disappoints its common man.

An electric skateboard might sound like something out of a back to the future movie, but two USC alumni are quickly turning the fantasy into a reality.
Ben Forman and Geoff Larson, class of 2009, are the founders of Intuitive Motion, a San Francisco-based start up that specializes in weight sensing electric skateboards.
Their flagship item, dubbed the ZBoard, was first launched two years ago. The idea is simple enough: lean forward to go and lean backward to stop.
Fast forward to now. It’s safe to say the public is rolling with the idea. Their original Kickstarter campaign in 2012 garnered nearly $280,000, and this month they are crowdfunding for the newest model, the ZBoard 2. When this story went to print, they had raised more than $179,000 from their $50,000 goal.
The idea for their board came to them while students in the Viterbi School of Engineering. Both mechanical engineer majors, they were brainstorming for their senior design capstone project.
“We thought it was a crucial need for certain people, so that they could complete trips that are too far to walk and too short to drive,” Forman said. “Making it electric will be a lot easier to ride on.”
They entered their design into the Marshall School of Business’s new venture competition in 2009 and were awarded second place.
“The success of the ZBoard team in taking their dream from a class design project to a vibrant start-up company is a shining example of what engineers can do when they embrace innovation,” said Peter Beerel, faculty director of innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering at the Viterbi Student Innovation Institute, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “They inspire us to make Viterbi engineering a launching pad for more such exciting ventures.”
Currently, there are three types of ZBoards available, with the entry-level model costing $599. The upcoming successor — a faster, lighter version — will cost $999. Though they’ve worked extensively with crowdsourcing initiatives. Forman said they had help from a lot of advisers and mentors from 500 startups, a business incubator based in San Francisco.
“Crowdfunding is a great new option to raise money especially for hardware companies,” said Ashish Soni, executive director of digital innovation at the Viterbi Student Innovation Institute. “ZBoard is a great example for the next generation company for hardware structure with a cross-functional team of engineers doing great things.”
For those at USC looking to create the “next big thing,” Forman suggests getting heavily involved in opportunities on campus.
“I would highly advise students at USC to enter as many contests as possible,” Forman said. “It’s not all about winning; you could meet other people who are into the same things and have experiences that you can learn from.”

A preliminary hearing was held on Tuesday at the Los Angeles Superior Court for three suspects accused of slaying Xinran Ji, an engineering graduate student who was killed near the University Park campus in July.  The evidentiary hearing allowed Deputy District Attorney John McKinney to present evidence to the jury.
For the case to go to trial, McKinney has to demonstrate by standard of reasonable likelihood that the crime was committed by the teenage defendants. Jonathan Del Carmen, 19; Alberto Ochoa, 17; and Alejandra Guerrero, 16, are suspected of robbing and beating late Ji on his way home over the summer.
McKinney presented footage from security cameras that show a group of people attacking the late student.  A video captured by a camera at the entrance of Ji’s apartment building depicts him walking, covered in blood.
Ochoa and Guerrero may face up to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Del Carmen and Garcia may face the death penalty.
The preliminary hearing reconvenes on Wednesday.

Last Thursday, Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer announced her decision to step down from her seat in the Senate. Hailed by politicians as California’s greatest Democratic senator, Boxer has been a prominent advocate for popular libertarian issues regarding women’s rights, gun control and abortion.
Boxer, aged 74, informally announced her withdrawal from her seat in the Senate alongside her grandson, Zachary Rodham. Boxer has worked in Congress since 1982, when she was appointed to the House and has held a seat in the Senate since she was first elected in 1992. Since then, she has had influence over a generation of eager Democratic candidates.
Dan Schnur, executive director of the USC Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, discussed possible effects resulting in the aftermath of Senator Boxer’s withdrawal from the Senate.
“Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein were first elected to the Senate in 1992, so it will almost be a quarter of a century that has passed since this seat last became open, which means there is a whole generation of young and not so young Democratic politicians with a whole lot of pent up ambition waiting to spill out over the next couple of election cycles,” Schnur said.
In the three minute interview uploaded via Boxer’s YouTube channel, Boxer and her grandson formulated a Q&A-type discussion in which Rodham posed popular questions addressed to Boxer by the media.
“I am never going to retire, the work is too important. But I will not be running for the Senate in 2016,” Boxer said.
Rodham opened the discussion by questioning why Boxer decided not to run in the 2016 election. Boxer assured Rodham and online viewers that her decision to withdraw from her seat in the Senate was not influenced by Washington’s bipartisan gridlock.
“You know, when you stand up there and you fight to make sure there is a strong middle class, and you protect women’s rights to choose, and you fight for jobs and a clean environment — all those things, human rights, civil rights — that’s a fight worth making. So, that is not a factor in my decision.”
Boxer made it clear of her intention to remain steadfast in the political arena.
“I am going to continue working on the issues that I love,” Boxer said. “ I’ll have more time to help other people through the PAC for change community, I have to make sure the Senate seat stays progressive, that is so critical, and I want to help our democratic candidate for president make history. But you know what, I want to come home to the state that I love so much, California.”
Rodham, a sophomore at USC, currently studies at the School of Cinematic Arts. Schnur commented on his role in the video.
“I was just happy to use a USC student as her interviewer, but I understand she knew him before he came to USC,” Schnur commented. “It was a very creative way of making the announcement. I don’t know this, but I am willing to guess that her grandson may have played some role in how it came together —  either way we are really proud of him.”
While Boxer’s decision to withdraw from a 2016 senatorial race took many by shock, others predicted her departure.
“One of the best ways of deciphering whether an elected official is going to run for reelection is to watch how much money they’ve raised for the next campaign. Boxer has been a very prolific fundraiser throughout her career but had raised almost no money for the 2016 election, so, a lot of people had assumed that she was heading to the exit,” Schnur said.
Boxer’s decision not to run for the 2016 election opens doors for other charismatic Democratic candidates such as California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who officially announced she will be running for the vacant seat.
“Kamala Harris, the state’s attorney general, has just announced that she is running for the seat and Harris immediately becomes a very strong early frontrunner,” Schnur said. “Tom Steyer, the billionaire and environmental activist, said that he is considering running in the race, as is former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Both would be formidable competition for Harris but there is no question that she starts in a very commanding position.”
It should be noted that the kid in the video, her grandson, is a current student here at USC; fight on!

In a statement that highlighted both the importance of education to the American economy and the crippling loan debt faced by many students in institutions of higher education
Officially, the program is known as “America’s College Promise Proposal: Tuition-free Community College for Responsible Students.” The program calls for community colleges to boost their curriculums and graduation rates, and calls upon states to invest more of their money into education and job training programs. The program’s timely announcement comes in light of new statistics, cited by the White House, that reveal that by 2020, the number of jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree education at minimum will comprise 35 percent of the job market.
The new plan outlines some requirements for the students. Eligible students must remain on a graduation track with a half-time course load or higher and maintain their grades at a 2.5 GPA or above to be eligible for the program’s free tuition for the first two years of their community college education. In order to make students able to transfer their community college education to four-year institutions, the Promise Proposal also calls on community colleges to revamp programs that currently are not transferable. If this condition isn’t met, the administration expects community colleges to offer two-year programs that train students for an in-demand job in the workforce.
Tom Placido, a junior studying economics, was not convinced of the program’s ability to retain quality students and invest in the existing community college network.
“Obama’s community college plan will flood already overcrowded institutions with underprepared students who don’t have a financial stake in their own education,” he said. “Couple that with community colleges’ underwhelming graduation and hiring rates, add in a huge federal incentive for grade inflation, and you’ve got a great recipe for fiscal and educational disaster.”
Alec White, a junior majoring in political science, disagreed. White emphasized the increasing importance of a college education in the work force.
“It is much harder in today’s job market to be successful with a high school degree than with a college degree and it is getting harder each day,” he said. “There are large numbers of talented students who do not go to college or even community college because their families cannot afford it. I think it is a great step in the right direction to help make college more affordable and help students get a more fair shot with education.”
In addition to expecting involvement from students and community colleges, the program relies on the willingness of states to join the program. If they choose to adopt the initiative, states will be expected to fund one quarter of the cost of providing the free tuition.
The program is flexible with state contributions. States that pledge to invest in the quality of community colleges and/or student outreach programs wouldn’t necessarily be expected to invest in the tuition share. To supplement the program, the White House also announced the creation of the American Technical Training Fund, which would award grants to create programs within community colleges that help transition students into jobs.
In announcing the program, the Obama administration cited evidence that documents the success of similar, smaller programs in states around the country.  When Tennessee introduced the program, for example, 90 percent of high school graduates applied, and the resulting programs produced Technology Training programs that placed 85 percent of graduates in jobs.
The Promise Proposal’s effectiveness on a wider scale remains to be seen. It is the latest in a long line of similar efforts taken by the Obama administration to make college affordable, including increase funding for Pell Grants and easing the burden of student loans faced by former students.

Undergraduate Student Government held its first Senate meeting of the spring semester yesterday to discuss new initiatives and progress with ongoing projects.
Even with some members of the executive board from last semester currently studying abroad, hopes for a successful rest of the year with the help of the remaining members and the 14 new hires.
USG President Andrew Menard gave a presentation on some of USG’s ongoing initiatives. One of his and USG Vice President Rini Sampath’s focuses this semester stems from a meeting with President C.L. Max Nikias at the end of the fall semester regarding the addition of a fall break to the academic calendar.
Menard said he is optimistic about moving forward with these initiatives into the spring semester.
“[Administration] is receptive if we can give proposals that make sense,” Menard said.
Menard also highlighted an initiative to take the responsibility for providing security at on-campus events off of student organizations. USG discussed with Nikias’ Leadership Council that security expenses for events like the Welcome Back Concert, Conquest and Springfest should not fall on student organizations.
The Academic Affairs Committee also presented plans for continuing the renovation of Leavey Library by going and gathering opinions on expanding collaboration space in the Leavey Library basement. The committee is also working on changing the web registration interface to improve the students’ experience signing up for classes online. Other projects Academic Affairs brought to the meeting include creating a calendar and increasing participation on course evaluations.
Sampath also discussed progress on the ongoing initiative to improve the experience of spring admits. The administration, after hearing USG’s initiative to provide more programs to better welcome and integrate spring admits into the USC community, developed a more extensive spring orientation program and held a spring convocation for the new students. USG released the online Spring Admit Resource Guide to help spring admits navigate their college experience, and Sampath said a transfer resource guide will soon follow.
USG officials also said at the meeting that their disability accessibility initiative has gained momentum as the board has been asked to give its proposal directly to Nikias. USG officials have met with Edward Roth, the director of Disability Services and Programs at the Division of Student Affairs and a member of the advisory board for the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity, who discussed using architects specialized in universal design on future projects. Universal design involves abiding by certain construction standards to observe the functionality of buildings, especially for students with disabilities.
Sampath said that she hopes all of these initiatives will be realized during the spring semester.
“For this semester, I know a personal goal of mine is wrap up a lot of the initiatives we worked on last semester; so, not just starting things but completing them whether that’s the proposal we had for fall housing, spring admits, or the disability accessibility and making sure some of those renovations take place. I’m really interested in seeing those things completed,” Sampath said.
[Correction: An earlier verison of this story that Edward Roth was the director of Disability Services and Programs at the Kortschak Center. Roth is the director of Disability Services and Programs under the Division of Student Affairs and an advisory board member at the Kortschak Center. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

Former men’s volleyball player and head coach Bob Yoder will be honored at the second annual The Ernie Event to celebrate Yoder and the start of the Trojan’s 2015 season on Jan. 31 at the Galen Center.
Yoder was an All-American outside hitter on the 1977 team that won the school’s first ever men’s volleyball national championship. In addition to his four years as a varsity letterman between 1976 and 1979, Yoder coached the team from 1982 to 1989, leading the team to a national title in 1988. Yoder also spent some time with the U.S. national team and as the head coach at Ohio State between playing and coaching at USC.
Yoder will be inducted into the USC Athletics Hall of Fame this year as part of the class of 2015. His jersey is retired in the Galen Center.
Yoder will be presented with the Ernie Award at the event, named after former volleyball head coach Ernie Hix. Yoder played all four years under Hix.
In addition to leading the program to its first national title in 1977, Hix guided the team to a championship in 1980. Hix was the head coach of the team from 1974-1981 and is known as “The Father of USC Men’s Volleyball.”
Hix coached a total of seven All-Americans — Dusty Dvorak, Tim Hovland, Celso Kalache, Pat Powers, Bill Stetson, Steve Timmons and Yoder — during his tenure at USC. Dvorak, Kalache, Powers and Timmons all played volleyball in the Olympics. Kalache represented Brazil in 1972 and 1976 while Dvorak, Powers and Timmons won gold medals for the United States team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Timmons also won gold at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul then brought home a bronze medal from the 1992 Games in Barcelona.
USC men’s volleyball has produced a total of four national championships, 33 All-Americans and 18 Olympians.
Former players and coaches, fans and the current team will be present at the event to celebrate both Yoder and the new season. Senior Associate Athletic Director J.K. McKay will speak at the event, then current head coach Bill Ferguson will introduce the current roster and offer remarks on the team.
The reception begins at 6 p.m. in the Galen Center.
The day before on Jan. 30, the Trojans will host Cal State Northridge in the Galen Center at 7 p.m. The match will be the seventh match and fourth home match of the season for the team. [Former Trojan National Players of the Year Tom Duke — 1988 —and Bryan Ivie — 1990 and 1991 — will have their jerseys retired at the match.]
The No. 7 Trojans won their first match of the season on      Jan. 7 at Grand Canyon in five sets. USC’s home opener is Jan. 16 at 8 p.m. in the Galen Center against Pepperdine.
Sophomore outside hitter Lucas Yoder and redshirt freshman setter Jack Yoder, who are both nephews of Bob Yoder, are current members on the team. Bob’s younger brother Dave Yoder—Lucas’s father and Jack’s uncle—was a four-year letterman with the team between 1984 and 1987. Jack’s older brother Paul Yoder played on the team last year. Bob’s daughter Erin Yoder also played volleyball at USC, lettering with the women’s team between 2009 and 2011.

The USC women’s tennis team starts their season ranked No. 14 in the nation, in addition to multiple players being ranked individually. On Wednesday, the Women of Troy will take on Loyola Marymount in their season opener at Manhattan Beach Country Club.
LMU posted an 8-15 record overall last season. That said, the Women of Troy are looking to establish themselves as a team to beat early on.
The Women of Troy look to improve upon their 18-8 season last year including an impressive 7-3 record in conference play. Last year, the team finished fourth in Pac-12 play behind Cal, UCLA and Stanford. This season will prove to be just as difficult as USC will be competing in an incredibly strong Pac-12. UCLA is ranked No. 1 overall in the nation, with Cal coming in at No. 7 and Stanford closing in on them tied for No. 8. Last season, the team upset Cal prior to conference play where they lost 0-4 to the regular season, undefeated champion. The Bruins, whom the Women of Troy lost to last season on three different occasions, will likely pose a significant challenge to USC this season. The Women of Troy have their sights set high as their campaign aims to send them to what would be a 24th consecutive trip to the NCAA tournament. Last season, the Women of Troy were able to make it to the round of 16 in the tournament before being ousted by No. 1 Georgia by a score of 3-4. USC defeated Idaho and No. 17 Michigan in the first and second rounds, respectively before running into Georgia.
USC boasts six ranked singles players and two ranked doubles teams. Among the top-50 singles players in the nation, junior Giuliana Olmos leads USC at No. 41. The team’s younger talent includes  freshmen Madison Westby who is ranked No. 45 and Gabby Smith, who is ranked at No. 48. In addition, senior Gabriella DeSimone is ranked No. 98 in the nation, while sophomore Zoe Katz sits at No. 119 in singles.
The doubles side of the team also has very high preseason expectations. Olmos and Smith are closing in on a top-10 ranking as they currently hold the No. 14 slot.
USC has welcomed three freshmen to their roster this season.  Two are nationally ranke Westby and Smith. In addition to these two players, Meredith Xepoleas will round out the group of rookies for the Women of Troy. These ladies will be on all the national watch lists, as they get ready to begin their athletic careers here at USC.
In addition to Wednesday’s match, the Women of Troy look forward to two upcoming tournaments, the Freeman Memorial and the National Collegiate Tennis Classic.

If you were to come try out for the USC club men’s lacrosse team this spring, you’d hear a variety of strange commentary from me and some of my teammates after noteworthy plays.
“Stuffed ’em like a turkey dinner!” sophomore goalie Josh Blockstein will holler after a point-blank save; “Believe me sweetie! I got enough to feed the needy!” I’ll shout back the next time someone rips a shot by him; and anytime we see a nifty pass assist on a goal, Josh and I will sing in perfect harmony: “Len’ me some sugar, I am your neighbah!”
It wasn’t until this winter break that I realized how much one man had influenced the dynamic of our lacrosse practices. It’s a feeling I think any athlete or sports fan can relate to because this man truly changed the way we enjoy sports.
Stuart Scott passed away at age 49 on Jan. 4 after a long battle with cancer. The legendary sportscaster was one of the original anchors for ESPN’s flagship show SportsCenter and was arguably the best ever in terms of enthusiasm and catchphrases.
If I have one critique of the media’s coverage and the sports world’s reaction to his death, it’s that almost everyone has misquoted Scott’s most signature catchphrase: “Boo-Yow!” Most tributes spelled it “Booyah!” and #booyah was trending on Twitter but former ESPN colleague Rich Eisen pointed out that Scott spelled it with a “yow” and not a “yah” on his notes. It’s a subtle change in pronunciation but the distinction, to me, epitomizes Scott perfectly.
Scott was a little different than every other sportscaster when he first arrived at ESPN. Not only was he a black man in an almost entirely white network, but he also really brought a unique culture and style as an African-American while reading sports highlights.
He referenced hip-hop lyrics — “that was as hardcore as             Wu-Tang Clan on steroids!” He impersonated southern Gospel preachers — “can I get a witness from the congregation?!” He made absurd comparisons — “just call him butter cuz he’s on a roll!” Best of all, he easily trademarked the most clever and spot-on simile for any clutch performance — “as cool as the other side of the pillow.” And I haven’t even mentioned his series of This Is SportsCenter commercials.
Not everyone loved Scott’s urban style right off the bat, including executives at ESPN. But Scott didn’t give in to the pressure to conform to the status quo. Instead, he boldly stayed true to his identity, even publishing a column on ESPN’s website explaining the cultural significance of the style. His professional courage earned the respect of many of his fellow broadcasters — Keith Olbermann’s tribute video was particularly touching — and the style eventually caught on.
Today, because of Scott, I can get away with quoting The Notorious B.I.G. and OutKast during a lacrosse practice. More importantly, Scott served as an inspiration for both                       African-American sports fans, as well as minority sports journalists.
“He was a trailblazer,” ESPN anchor Stan Verrett said in an obituary by ABC. “He did not shy away from the fact that he was a black man and that allowed the rest of us who came along to just be ourselves.”
Travis Waldron, a reporter for ThinkProgress.org, wrote that Scott helped ESPN “reach a demographic — young people in general but particularly black males who rarely see themselves and their culture or style represented in the sports media — that it hadn’t connected with before,” adding that ESPN is now the best in the industry in terms of racial and gender diversity on staff.
It’s impossible to fully quantify the impact Scott had on the growth of the network.
But looking back on his career certainly makes me wonder what the sports world would look like today if he were never discovered. Would ESPN have grown to the top of the world anyways? Would our society be as obsessed with sports 365 days a year? Would the Daily Trojan even make room for a sports column every day? Would I have dreamed about becoming a sportscaster once I realized I wasn’t cut out for professional sports and have applied to USC’s journalism school?
Though there’s no way to answer that, I will say this.
As I just alluded to, Scott had the dream job. I don’t mean that he figuratively had my dream job, I literally mean that I would sit and watch SportsCenter reruns just about every day for years while growing up imagining that I would one day be able to do that.
In some ways, Scott was very lucky. He was blessed with the necessary talent and opportunity to talk about sports for a living. That was his career, his livelihood.
But his passion for what he did didn’t seem to be out of some ego trip from being on national TV. I always felt like he truly, genuinely wanted to make people happy when he went on air.
The amount of love in his heart is not best exemplified by career, though. For that, his  battle with cancer is the best piece of evidence. It revealed that his true passions in life weren’t sports or entertainment, but his daughters, Taelor and Sydni.
I think it’s almost impossible for a motivational speech to compare with Jim Valvano’s epic “Don’t Give Up, Don’t Ever Give Up,” speech at ESPN’s 1993 ESPY Awards, but Scott’s speech while accepting the Jimmy Valvano Perseverance Award at last summer’s ESPY Awards did just that.
“When you die, that does not mean you lose to cancer,” he said. “You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and the manner in which you live.”
The eloquence of such a statement is almost jarring, especially when compared to the aforementioned six-letter exclamation for which he is most famous. But it got even better.
“The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I will ever do,” he said, “is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni. It’s true.”
So in conclusion, my takeaway from the celebration of Stuart Scott’s life is not necessarily to “follow your passion,” “don’t give up on your dream,” “do what you love,” or some other cliche about career advice.
Sure, he had a great job, but his life was so much more than the catchphrases and commercials. He did what he loved, but he also did what people loved him to do. It took some time to figure out what exactly he was saying, but sports fans truly did love him.
Before you go all-in on following your passion, Scott would ask you “why you live” for these passions or what purpose you find in them. He knew his why.
It’s impossible for me to comprehend what Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15, are going through. I can’t even imagine the pain of losing a parent at this age. But when I think of Scott himself, I feel a sense of satisfaction in the amount of life he packed into his 49 years.
I’m tremendously grateful that I got to watch him growing up and that I get to watch and cover sports in the world he helped create. I can still hear his        “Boo-Yow!” call loud and clear in my head, with more exuberance and more swag than anyone else’s imitation.
No one ever said it better. No one ever will.

Following a narrow loss to the Stanford Cardinal earlier in the week, the Trojans men’s basketball team will try for a victory against its crosstown rival when the UCLA Bruins visit the Galen Center on Wednesday night.
The Trojans (9-7, 1-3 Pac 12) were able to keep it close against Stanford until the very end and dropped their Pac-12 meeting, 78-76. Sophomore guard Julian Jacobs led the Trojans with 16 points and freshman guard Jordan McLaughlin and sophomore forward Nikola Jovanovic added 14 points and 13 points, respectively. The two spent a lot of time on the court together in the game, and head coach Andy Enfield was happy with how the two played together.
“I liked what we saw. Julian was playing well at the point, Jordan was really good coming off screens and making plays,” Enfield said. “Jordan’s a true point guard and Julian is really a point that can play the two because he has bigger size, but I’m fine with both of them playing either position.”
Stanford (11-4, 3-1) was led by senior guard Anthony Brown, who had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and the Cardinal was able to earn its third straight win over the Trojans. Junior forward Rosco Allen had a career-high 18 points, 12 of which came from behind the arc. Senior center Stefan Nastic had 15 points and senior guard Chasson Randle added 12.
The Trojans were able to cut the deficit to one at the end of the game, led in part to a flurry of points by Jacobs and freshman guard Elijah Stewart. Stanford missed a few 3-point plays, and USC capitalized on the miscues to give themselves a chance to win. McLaughlin, in his first game back from injury, turned the ball over in the closing seconds and Stanford made a clutch free throw to preserve the win.
Despite the tough loss, McLaughlin was able to stay positive.
“We battled and we can get some positive things out of this,” said McLaughlin. “At the end of the day, that’s all we can ask for.”
The Trojans look to move on from the defeat as they face the Bruins (10-7, 2-2) on Wednesday night. UCLA is led by freshman forward Kevon Looney, who was recently named Pac-12 Player of the Week after averaging 21 points and 13 rebounds in the Bruins’ two conference wins over Stanford and California. Looney is the only freshman in the nation to be averaging a double-double, and he ranks 12th in the nation with 10.3 rebounds per game. With Looney leading the way, UCLA ranks first in the Pac-12 in rebounds per game (41.4) and offensive rebounds per game (13.9).
Not only will USC try to win the battle of the boards down low, but they will also attempt to contain the main scorers on the Bruins. Sophomore guard Bryce Alford ranks seventh in the Pac-12 in scoring and leads the Bruins with 15.4 points per game. Sophomore guard Isaac Hamilton has provided consistent scoring for UCLA and has scored in double digits in 12 of 17 games on the year.
Enfield is treating the contest as if it is just another game.
“UCLA is a terrific team — very talented, very well-coached — and they’re playing well right now,” Enfield said. “For us to have a good Pac-12 record, they’re one of the 11 teams we have to beat. So we look at that as another Pac-12 game with a little extra enthusiasm because they are local, it’s a rival, and it should be a great crowd in here. But we’re looking to really ramp this up on a national scale and the first thing we have to do is win league games.”
In addition to conference standings, the game will count toward the BMW Crosstown Cup, a competition between the two schools that includes all sports. The winner of the game will earn 15 points toward the season’s score which the Bruins currently lead 45-10.
“It should be a very exciting game,” said McLaughlin. “We’re getting better every day in practice, so it should be a fun game.”
The game will tip off at 6 p.m. at the Galen Center and will be broadcast on ESPN2.
