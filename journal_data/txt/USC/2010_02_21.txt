A new Annenberg minor, to begin in fall 2010, will give students a chance to explore the relationship between sports and culture in a city that boasts one of the fastest growing sports hubs.

Annenberg’s School for Communication & Journalism has approved a new sports media studies minor to give students hoping to enter the sports media profession a chance to learn necessary skills.
The idea for the minor was born from Professor Daniel Durbin’s 383 Sports, Communication and Culture course (COMM 383). Durbin always asks his students what additional programs they would like to see at Annenberg and overwhelmingly students asked for more sports-focused classes.
“Two-thirds of the students in the class always voted for more sports courses,” said Phillip Schaben, a senior majoring in communication who took Durbin’s class in the fall. “We would watch people on SportsCenter, Universal Sports, ESPN, and wonder, ‘Where are these people getting their training from?’”
Durbin began formulating the idea for the sports media studies minor over the summer and started formally pursuing the idea this fall.
Schaben and classmate Kenneth Badea, a junior majoring in communication, heard of Durbin’s proposal while they were taking his class and offered to help get the program off the ground by spreading awareness. The two created a Facebook group to demonstrate to Annenberg that there was widespread interest in a sports-centric degree program.
Badea said he thinks it is important for Annenberg to integrate sports classes into its curriculum.
“Like any university, we tend to focus on traditional media,” Badea said. “People are apprehensive about sports journalism — thinking it’s just a filler — when it’s really something we need to focus on. Channels like ESPN have 24 hours just about sports, just like some channels do for news. USC being where it is, with this incredible proximity to all this sports media, is in a prime position to become a leading university in sports journalism.”
Durbin said the Annenberg Dean’s Office is interested in a more complete study of sports communication, and the minor is one way of helping students keep up with the expanding sports media world.
“Sports media is only growing at this point,” Durbin said. “This minor is a reaction to an increase in its impact on culture and vice versa. Outside of politics and war, sports is the largest industry in the world.”
The sports media culture has grown particularly rapidly in Los Angeles in recent years, as sports networks, including ESPN, have brought more corporate offices to Southern California.
The debut of the Los Angeles production center as the headquarters for ESPN’s 1 a.m. EST SportsCenter in 2009 also contributed to the recognition of Los Angeles as one of the largest sports media metropolises in the nation.
Currently, the only requirement for the minor is Durbin’s COMM 383 class. Beyond that, students can choose from several electives that span various schools, including Annenberg, the Marshall School of Business and the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences.
“USC prides itself on having a very rich selection of minors. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary minors … The idea here is to encourage degrees that allow students to be exposed to faculty in different areas,” said Abigail Kaun, associate dean of academic programs and student affairs for Annenberg.
One of those elective classes is a new Annenberg class, Sports and Social Change, which will be offered in the spring 2011 semester. The course, taught by Durbin, will examine how athletes become agents of social change through the media.
Besides that course, the program will draw largely on classes that already exist.
The sports media studies minor is officially being integrated into the fall 2010 curriculum, having received approval.
Any new class or degree must withstand scrutiny from every department involved once it is conceived.
After the structural proposal is developed, it must be approved by the faculty and school dean.  From there, the program is given to the university curriculum committee to be reviewed by faculty from other schools and departments, and finally to the university faculty as a whole.
To survive, a new degree must be able to prove that it is a relevant and important field of study, that the field is unique and distinct and that it fits into the curriculum goals of the school.

A group of USC students could help set the course for future innovations in solar energy.
The X Prize Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to technological advancements through competition and prizes, selected USC as the site of a lab to develop a competition for the field of solar energy. Other notable X Prizes have been created in the fields of space travel and genomics, but this will be the first that focuses on energy.
The students working in the X Prize Lab are charged with developing the next X Prize challenge. The goal is to create a “breakthrough challenge” that, if overcome, will produce a monumental development in the field of solar energy.
“What we’re challenging students to do is figure out, what is an X Prize-worthy solar challenge. Does it mean solar energy at a more economic level? Solar energy as a substitute for other energy technologies? The idea is to give the students enough technical, business, societal and economic information [to make that decision],” said Jonathan Lasch, a professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering.
The lab is part of a class, the Dean’s Seminar in Entrepreneurship (ENGR 493X). The class is led by Lasch, who is also the director of the Alfred E. Mann Institute; and Gene Miller, director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business. The class is open to business students and engineering students.
Currently, the class is examining different problems around solar energy: technological challenges and possibilities, business efforts, policy implications and research and development. Each class session features a guest speaker who addresses one of those issues.
In the second half of the semester, student teams will develop recommendations for a solar energy challenge and will give presentations to a panel comprised of members from the faculty and the X Prize Foundation.
Students in the class said they are intrigued by the possibility of making a lasting contribution to the field of solar energy.
“It’s very interesting — not like any experience I’ve had before,” said Lorenzo Mangubat, a junior majoring in chemical engineering. “It’s something that I feel has real-world applications, so I’m all for it.”
Lasch said the program is a good opportunity for students to learn what it is like to work in a team setting and to focus on important issues.
“Even if it doesn’t lead to the next X Prize challenge, it still is a good medium to learn to take info from multiple dimensions to look at complex scenarios,” Lasch said. “This is the sort of [function] that senior management in large corporations perform.”
Miller also noted the value of learning how to see the big picture from a variety of different perspectives.
“[It places you] at a higher level of understanding policy impact: ‘What’s going to change the world we’re living in? What are the stumbling blocks that have to be overcome?’” Miller said.
Though the final reports are still to come, students said they have already come to the consensus that one of the primary challenges facing solar energy innovations is efficiency.
“Cost is the major issue — something that is a cost-efficient system,” said Sarah Hansen, senior majoring in accounting and a member of the class.
Mangubat agreed.
“One of the complications with solar energy is that there are so many competing technologies and so many challenges unique to each,” he said. “Which challenge is the most significant — which challenge is the one which, if resolved, would really make an impact in solar? Probably efficiency — I think solar tech has yet to reach a certain cost-effectiveness that will really make it competitive [with other forms of energy production].”
Lasch said, regardless of whether the class’ proposal is used, he hopes students retain the techniques of critical analysis. Mangubat, however, has loftier goals.
“I would consider [the class] a success if my peers and I are able to formulate an X Prize statement that developers of solar technology will feel is attainable and worth their effort,” he said.
The USC lab is the third in the country, along with labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Washington.

About 6,000 students received a series of unsolicited e-mails they described as “annoying” and “ridiculous” after a USC alumnus found a glitch that enabled him to e-mail the Undergraduate Student Government’s listserv.
On Feb. 20, graduate Dennis Roberts used the USG listserv to e-mail students a link to “The Daily Crow,” a blog that features pictures that integrate the word “crow.”
Roberts said he sent the e-mail as a joke and that there was no meaning to “The Daily Crow.”
“I kind of suspected that it could be done for a while because I got so many e-mails saying ‘test’ or ‘take me off this listserv,’” Roberts said. “I got fed up of getting all these random e-mails from USG and kind of filling my inbox with spam, so I just decided to, as a joke and to see if it could be done, to send out a student project that we were working on.”
But some did not see it as a joke.
Paige Hill, USG director of communications, called the e-mail “immature” and “inappropriate.”
“It’s really frustrating that a fellow student would do that,” Hill said. “I’m actually kind of frustrated at ITS because they did not convey to us that the listserv was not completely secure.”
USG has used the listserv for more than five years and Hill said it has never encountered this kind of problem.
Listservs usually come with safeguards, where only the list’s administrators can use it to send out e-mails. The USG listserv, however, was not set up in this manner, leaving it prone to exploitation. Therefore, whenever a student hit the “reply all” link, all the people on the listserv would receive the e-mail.
Roberts’s e-mail generated a chain of replies that were received by everyone on USG’s listserv. The replies ranged from confused inquiries to advertisements for student groups.
On Sunday, USG issued an apology to the members of its listserv.
“USG would like to sincerely apologize for the array of inappropriate e-mails you have received this weekend,” the e-mail said. “Unfortunately, one of our fellow students hacked our system and has since been harassing the USC community with an array of immature and ridiculous messages.”
USG also sent Robert what he called a “threatening” e-mail, saying they were going to take the issue up to the administration, calling his actions “disgusting” and saying that additional action would be taken.
Roberts said he often receives e-mails from the listserv that are not directed at him and are generated when people hit “reply all.” He said he thought USG’s response was “over-the-top” and wondered if they thought he was the one sending out all the e-mails, even though he only sent out one that generated many responses.
“They’re angry with me, I guess because I sent out that one e-mail and they’re not happy about that,” Roberts said. “But if they’re going to be angry, then they should be angry at themselves for setting up something that is so easy to take advantage of.”
Roberts said there was no particular reason for the link to the “Daily Crow.”
“The crow blog was pretty dumb,” Roberts said. “In terms of all the projects that I’ve ever created or worked on, it’s probably the stupidest thing ever …  I was like, ‘Oh, if I’m going to send out something to 10,000 people it might as well be something as stupid as this crow blog.’ I don’t think my e-mail was immature, but the crow blog was pretty stupid.”
One student who received the chain of e-mails said she tried to disregard them and did not click any of the links.
“I sort of thought it was spam so that’s why I didn’t click on any of the links to the websites because I thought some virus would overtake my computer,” said Keanna Harper, a freshman majoring in business and cinematic arts.
Harper said she thinks USG should take steps to protect students’ information.
“If someone can take it that easily, how do you know they can’t get my personal information that USG has, like phone numbers?” she said.
ITS was unavailable for comment.
“USG would like to sincerely apologize for the array of inappropriate e-mails you have received this weekend,” the e-mail said. “Unfortunately, one of our fellow students hacked our system and has since been harassing the USC community with an array of immature and ridiculous messages.”
I’d hardly consider hitting the reply-all button “hacking,” USG–it speaks more about your lack of system controls than anything else.
ya dennis.
There is a lot of confusion about this incident. It appears from USG’s response and this article that people believe that Roberts did some sort of hacking or computer abuse.
I’m not sure what standard you are using, but hitting reply-all is not considered hacking.
The real culprits of this problem are the complete security failures at ITS.
Proper blame needs to be placed not on the people who made this problem known but on those who failed to perform their PAID jobs and allows this breach of email policy and computer security.
ITS’s fault?…Not so fast. Listservs are USER CREATED and USER MAINTAINED. List owners CHOOSE how they want their list to be updated. USG did not have their list MODERATED ( http://www.usc.edu/its/maillists/ownercard.html#moderateE ) which left it unprotected i.e. UNMODERATED. Had USG secured the list properly, this would not have happened in the 1st place.

For a weekend that held so much promise for No. 3 USC men’s volleyball team (8-5, 6-4), the final results left the Trojans exiting the gates of the Galen Center Saturday night with mixed emotions.
In a stretch of the season that was paved with confidence-building opportunities, the typically energetic group has looked like a shell of the team they had displayed throughout the first month of the campaign — most notably in their three-set loss to the Pepperdine Waves Friday at the Galen Center.
But while the Trojans’ home appearances have been few and far between this season, playing back-to-back nights at the Galen Center this weekend seemed like the perfect opportunity to get back on course.
The Trojans’ first opponent was one that has also faced difficulties. The Pacific Tigers (6-11, 0-11) came into Friday’s match having lost seven of their past 10 games. But in a conference as tough as the MPSF, the Trojans learned firsthand that a much-needed boost to their morale would not come easy.
Despite the addition of freshman outside hitter Maddison McKibbin to the starting lineup, the Trojans fell to the same bad habits that had plagued them during their recent skid. The Tigers — behind freshman outside hitter Taylor Hughes (26 kills and 10 digs on the night) — coasted to an easy first-set victory (30-25), pounding the Trojans with a .380 hitting percentage.
The Tigers took advantage of the Trojans meager hitting percentage in the second set (.093) while dominating defensively en route to another impressive set victory (30-25).
But while Pacific had upset on its mind, the Trojans recognized that their season had been filled with late-match heroics.
Friday night would be no different.
In a move, that seemed to be out of desperation or an attempt at strategy, coach Bill Ferguson began the third set by substituting senior outside hitter Tyler Stevens and former-starting libero sophomore Andrew Pizula into the lineup.
The move paid off, as the Trojans’ played inspired volleyball for the first time in two weeks behind junior captain Murphy Troy’s 26 kills, junior middle blocker Austin Zahn’s 10 blocks, and Pizula’s 18 digs. USC mounted an 8-0 run in the set (30-23), and quickly changed the direction of the game. Despite a tie at 26 late in the fourth set, the Trojans’ played their best defense in recent memory, posting a match-high seven blocks in the set (32-30), as they forced a fifth and final set.
By the fifth set, the writing was clearly written on the wall. Behind a match-high .538 hitting percentage, USC quickly got out in front of the Pacific, 9-3, as they stunned Pacific with another remarkable comeback (15-10).
Typically a comeback of Friday night’s proportions would warrant celebration or at the very least, a renewed sense of confidence inside the Trojan locker room. However, with their shortest recovery time of the season, the unexpected loss of senior leader Hunter Current to a mild ankle sprain and a duel with the No. 2 Stanford Cardinal (8-4, 7-4) the next afternoon, USC had no time to rest on its laurels.
True to recent form, the Trojans welcomed reigning National Player of the Year Brad Lawson and Stanford to the Galen Center in a giving mood, as they surrendered the first set without a fight or sense of urgency (16-30), finishing with more errors (10) than kills (nine).
“I don’t really know what the problem has been with us starting matches,” sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli said. “Maybe we aren’t focused enough at the beginning. I cannot really tell you, but it’s something that we need to fix by the end of the season or our national championship hopes will be dashed.”
Stanford, behind a balanced attack in the second set (7.5 blocks on defense) and three aces on offense, continued their onslaught of the Trojans (30-28) in a frame that all but squashed any hope inside the Galen Center of a repeat of the night before.
While Ciarelli (career-high 23 kills and 14 digs) single-handedly attempted to get the Trojans back in the match with a crucial block and kill to secure the third set (30-28), Saturday’s ending was more befitting of the February-version of the Trojans than the one that looked so poised and confident just a month earlier at UC Irvine.
Cardinal sophomore libero Erik Shoji helped his No. 2 team put a strangle hold on a convincing road win, with six crucial digs in the final frame (30-23), as Stanford eased its way to a season-high five game winning streak, leaving the Trojans once again perplexed at the recent turn of events.
“Our team is a very talented group of individuals that have high expectations to win and the fact that we are not winning is frustrating,” USC senior middle blocker Steven Shandrick said. “We just need to focus on taking the season one game at a time.
For the Trojans, the weekend’s mixed results provide an appropriate evaluation for the team’s recent topsy-turvy performance. The road ahead for USC doesn’t get any easier, as they face the No. 1 Cal State Northridge Matadors on Wednesday night at the Galen Center. While the game presents an opportunity for the Trojans to stake some revenge, you can bet the only thing on the team’s mind at this point is trying to improve going toward the home stretch.
“I think we all had higher expectations than where we are right now, but this is a good league and losses are going to happen,” Ciarelli said. “This weekend is an improvement from how we had played the last few weeks. I think now that we are more of a team we will be able to improve a lot in the next few weeks.”

Last time it was Klay Thompson carrying the load. This time it was everyone else.
Despite holding the Washington State sophomore star Thompson to just two points on 0-12 shooting, the USC men’s basketball team (16-10, 8-6) fell once again to the Cougars, this time on the road 51-47.
Frustrating · Senior guard Dwight Lewis and the Trojans held Washington State to just 38 percent field goal shooting on Saturday but struggled to produce much offense of their own against the Cougars. Lewis led the Trojans with 14 points. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Washington State guards freshman Reggie Moore and sophomore Abe Lodwick filled in for their teammate’s lack of scoring, posting 12 and 11 points, respectively, including a combined 12 points in the final five minutes of the game. Moore banked a three-pointer with 51.4 seconds left, giving the Cougars a four-point advantage that proved to be enough to hold off USC.
The Trojans’ road struggles continued largely because of poor shooting; they converted only 38 percent of their shots from the field and went a dismal two for 14 from three-point range. Senior guard Dwight Lewis led the team with 14 points, and sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic added 12 points and seven rebounds, but a collective eight points from the rest of the starters doomed USC in the end.
“We played very selfishly … for the first time in a long time,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill told the Los Angeles Times. “I thought guys were worried about themselves a little bit too much, whether they were in the game or not. We never got down to playing basketball until the last three or four minutes.”
The two teams’ offensive weaknesses kept the score knotted throughout the entire first half (neither squad ever led by more than four points). USC jumped to a 2-0 lead 23 seconds into the game on a layup by redshirt junior forward Alex Stepheson but did not score again for four and a half minutes. The Cougars were only able to convert two points in the first five minutes as well, and by the midway point of the first half the score was a meager 8-6 in favor of Washington State.
The first half closed on a better note offensively, and the Cougars took a 23-19 advantage into the break.
The second half once again featured a glaring lack of offense from USC, but this time it was not reciprocated by the Cougars. The Trojans managed only four points in the first six and a half minutes as Washington State took a nine-point lead and, despite a determined rally in the final minutes, the Trojans were not able to recover. A three-pointer attempt by Lewis to tie the game with seven seconds left that clanked off the iron sealed the loss for USC, which is now 2-7 on the road.
The defeat drops USC into sole possession of third place in the Pac-10, one and a half games behind conference-leading California. The Trojans have four games left to play, two of which will be at home, but will need help from the teams above them to have a chance of winning the Pac-10.

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team does not believe in talking for talk’s sake.
Accordingly, when the Women of Troy declared that they wanted to get off to a better start and play a more complete game against UC Irvine, you had no choice but to believe them. This past Saturday, the Women of Troy backed up their talk, beating No. 11 UC Irvine 15-5.
On the strength of senior goalie Tumua Anae’s continued brilliance in goal and senior drivers Alexandra Kiss’ and Kally Lucas’ hat tricks, the Women of Troy derived much more satisfaction from this effort.
Although the Anteaters scored the first goal of the game, their hopes of winning were dashed quickly as the Women of Troy scored nine of the next 10 goals. All told, eight different players scored at least one goal — a scoring balance that has been a staple of this team thus far.
In the box score, this was another lopsided victory, as has been the case for all of the team’s wins this year. Afterwards, USC coach Jovan Vavic compared the match favorably to last week’s victory over Loyola Marymount.
“Our defense was better. We were more focused and executed better,” Vavic said. “We did a good job on 5-on-6 defense and improved our scoring 6-on-5. Overall, there was better focus on their part.”
In terms of execution, nowhere was this more apparent than in Kiss’ and Lucas’ statistics. The two scored on a combined six of their seven shots.
Heading into this game, “focus” was the buzzword. The Women of Troy, indisputably a much more talented team on paper, did not want to make it a habit of playing down to the skill level of their opponents. To avoid the complacency problem that besets so many powerhouse teams, Vavic and team leaders made certain that the players knew they must play all four quarters with the same sense of desperation and intensity. For this game at least, the message resonated with the women.
The USC women’s water polo team will face Hawaii at McDonald’s Swim Stadium this Thursday at 5 p.m. The Women of Troy will look for another solid all-around performance before heading to UC Irvine again for the crucial UC Irvine Invitational. A clash with No. 1 Stanford is possible as both teams will be favored to reach the finals of the annual tournament.

Playing in front of an unfriendly crowd, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team (9-1, 0-0) began another winning streak  by defeating Pepperdine (3-3, 0-0) 6-1.
Fast start · Sophomore Daniel Nguyen paired with Steve Johnson to capture an 8-5 doubles victory, the first win of the day against Pepperdine. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The Waves were motivated to play the formerly top-ranked Trojans on their home court, and their supporters encouraged the home team loudly and passionately.
“[Pepperdine] had a really good environment here, with many fans yelling at the players,” USC coach Peter Smith, who coached the Waves from 1998-2002, said. “You really have to earn everything you get.”
Even with the strong showing, the home-team support was not enough to overcome the Trojans’ strong performance.
Sophomores Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen started off the doubles portion with an 8-5 victory over their opponents, senior Bassam Beidas and sophomore Hugh Clarke.
In winning the doubles point, the newly ranked No. 30 duo of juniors Jaak Poldma and Peter Lucassen continued to display exceptional tennis. They extended their doubles win streak to seven matches with an 8-4 win.
The Trojans quickly asserted themselves during the singles portion, with Lucassen adding to the Trojan tally with a 6-1, 6-2 defeat of No. 115 freshman Finn Tearney.
No. 27 senior Robert Farah quickly followed with a dominating performance of two-time All-American No. 44 Beidas 6-2, 6-3.
No. 68 Poldma sealed the team victory, cruising to a 6-4, 6-1 win after overcoming an inconsistent start.
In a compelling match, No. 1 sophomore Steve Johnson seemingly had victory in hand over sophomore Alex Llompart, winning the first set 6-1. During the second set, Llompart kept the crowd energized, winning several crucial break points and countering Johnson on some extended rallies. Johnson survived the effort and claimed the deciding second set, 7-5.
“Llompart is a great competitor,” Smith said. “Steve just has to do a better job to close him out.”
Play continued as sophomore Daniel Nguyen lost a back-and-forth three-set match, falling 4-6, 6-1, 0-1 (10-4).
Sophomore Matt Kecki finished out the match winning his fifth straight singles match 6-3, 6-3 over sophomore Daniel Moss.
USC responded well to its first true road test at a crucial juncture of its season.
The Trojans will have one more home match against San Diego State on Tuesday before starting Pac-10 conference play with three away matches.
Gaining confidence against a quality opponent and having to tune out the partisan crowd including several highly audible hecklers will help the handle the slate of conference matches.
Lucassen and Poldma have stood out recently, meshing well in doubles. Both have shined as individuals.
“They have turned it on as of late, and both have been playing great,” Smith said in describing the juniors’ latest performances.
Although USC displayed some dominant tennis, some flaws were still evident.
Farah and freshman JT Sundling were not able to close out a match in which they led five games to three, and which would eventually settle in a tiebreaker.
In that tiebreaker, they were unable to convert three match points, eventually losing to Llompart and Tearney.
“It was not perfect, but it was a good result for us,” Smith said.

Sophomore third baseman Ricky Oropesa led off the top of the ninth inning with a solo homerun to break a 4-4 tie, and the Trojans tacked on four more runs in the frame to give USC a 9-4 victory against Cal Poly in the rubber game of a three-game set at Baggett Stadium Sunday.
Table setter · Infielder Ricky Oropesa hit a homerun in the top of the ninth inning to break a 4-4 tie. The Trojans eventually won 9-5. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
After Oropesa’s game-winning drive, junior second baseman Joe De Pinto, who went 3-5 with one RBI and two runs scored, singled to third base, driving in a run. A Mustangs’ (1-2) throwing error on the play allowed two more runs to cross the plate. De Pinto advanced to third on the play and scored later in the inning.
“It was a huge inning for the Trojans,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said. “In these three games, we’ve seen a lot of character in these young players. There’s a lot of battle within this team.” 
USC freshman designated hitter Cade Kreuter hit an eighth-inning two-run homerun to put the Trojans ahead, 4-3, but junior reliever Ryan Cabral gave up the lead in the bottom half of the inning. Cal Poly pinch hitter Elliot Stewart’s two-out RBI single to center tied the game. USC senior Shuhei Fujiya (1-0) relieved Cabral to record the final four outs of the game and earn the win.
Although the final line might not indicate it, the game was a tight pitcher’s duel before the late-inning scoring frenzy. USC senior pitcher Kevin Couture went seven innings and gave up three runs on six hits with three strikeouts, and Cal Poly sophomore Kyle Anderson gave up four runs on seven hits with five strikeouts in 7 1/3 innings.
“Once he got into the third inning, he settled down and really got into a rhythm that carried us and kept us in the ballgame,” Krueter said.
The Mustangs’ lone victory of the opening-season series against the Trojans (2-1) came Saturday. Behind sophomore pitcher Mason Radeke’s six-inning, one-run performance, Cal Poly defeated the Trojans 10-6. Radeke (1-0) struck out seven batters in his outing and struck out the side to escape a bases loaded jam in the second inning.
Cal Poly built a 7-1 lead in the fifth before surviving two late USC rallies. After USC cut the lead to 7-5 in the seventh, Mustangs’ senior reliever Mark DeVincenzi earned the save by inducing a groundout from USC senior centerfielder Mike O’Neill with the bases loaded.
USC sophomore starter Chad Smith (0-1) allowed seven runs (six earned) in 4 1/3 innings with five walks and four strikeouts.
Junior third baseman Matt Hart went 3-4 for the Trojans with two doubles, but USC stranded 14 runners on the base paths.
USC defeated Cal Poly, 9-4, in its season opener Friday night. Sophomore right-hander Andrew Triggs (1-0) solidified his spot at the top of the Trojans’ weekend rotation by allowing four runs and striking out seven in seven innings.
With the help of two misplays by the Mustangs in the field, the Trojans took the lead in the fifth and extended it in the seventh and eight innings to win their 14th season opener in the last 18 seasons.
De Pinto went 3-4 with two doubles and sophomore designated hitter Matthew Foat went 4-5 with four RBIs, and Cabral earned the save for the Trojans.

It won’t be remembered as an offensive masterpiece, but the USC women’s basketball team has to feel good after snapping a five-game losing streak Saturday night against Washington.
USC (14-11, 8-6) scraped and clawed its way to a narrow 56-51 win over the Huskies (9-16, 4-11) despite shooting just 34 percent from the field. A newfound commitment to rebounding and tenacious defense carried the Women of Troy to victory.
“We do a lot of rebounding and beat on each other in practice,” junior center Kari LaPlante said. “It’s finally paid off. We came out there with a lot of energy and passion.”
Redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos and LaPlante said the crowd and an unusual pregame pep talk by USC coach Michael Cooper gave the Women of Troy an added boost. Cooper played the team a recording of a halftime speech by former Indiana coach Bob Knight.
“It was inspiring,” Cooper said. “It had me inspired earlier in the day so I thought I’d play it for the team.”
Whatever Knight said in the speech worked. USC was the more active team for much of the game and came up with seemingly every loose ball. In an unfamiliar turn of events, the Women of Troy outrebounded Washington 36-30 and grabbed 15 offensive rebounds.
Freshman forward Christina Marinacci played well in her second career start, and set the tone for the game with three early offensive rebounds. She finished with five points, four rebounds and three steals.
“Starting her gives us another player that’s going to go with [LaPlante] and put her head under the basket,” Cooper said. “Good things happen when you get a rebounder like that.”
Poor shooting by Washington helped the Women of Troy take a 28-22 lead into the locker room at halftime. The Huskies made just 8-of-27 shots in the half and turned the ball over nine times.
Washington guard Kristi Kingma kept the Huskies close in the first half with 12 points. Kingma finished with a game-high 15 points but was largely ineffective in the second half.
“Our focus [in the first half] was on [guard Sami] Whitcomb,” Cooper said. “I don’t think we made too much of an adjustment in the second half, other than [we] just paid more attention to her and guarded her.”
A slow start to the second half by USC allowed the Huskies to build a 44-38 lead with 10 minutes left in the game. Washington knocked down nine of its first 12 shots in the half and looked to be well on its way to victory before a series of clutch plays by USC turned the game around.
Senior guard Daniela Roark started the run with a baseline three-pointer that pulled the Women of Troy to within two points. Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath tied the game at 44 with an offensive rebound and putback. Gemelos knocked down a deep three-pointer against the shot clock to give USC a one-point lead it would not relinquish.
The play of the game came courtesy of LaPlante, who hit a turnaround jumper in the post that gave USC a 54-51 lead with 22 seconds left. Sophomore guard Ashley Corral stole the ball and knocked down two free throws for the final margin.
Gemelos led the Women of Troy with 13 points in just 19 minutes. LaPlante and Gilbreath added 10 points apiece for USC.
“It’s not bittersweet anymore,” Gemelos said after picking up her first win in five tries. “It feels great.”
USC beat the Huskies 69-65 earlier this season in Seattle. The Women of Troy travel north to take on the Oregon schools next week.

For more than 59 minutes, USC never led the Pac-8 Hockey Conference Championship Game.
As it turned out, the Trojans needed only 20 seconds to make their move.
With time winding down in the third period and the score tied at 4-4, junior forward Alex Lofthus streaked down the left wing and threw the puck toward the net. Junior forward Ryder Fyrwald tipped it past Washington goaltender Danny Dougan giving USC a 5-4 victory and the conference crown.
The title was USC’s eighth in the league’s 15-year existence.
“You know, for us, the real problem was the first period,” coach Mark Wilbur said after the game. “We couldn’t get it out of gear. But every single game the guys responded.”
Fyrwald, playing for the first time after a three semester break, recorded a hat trick on the game winner. He finished the tournament with six goals, earning him MVP honors.
“It was surreal,” Fyrwald said of the final few seconds of the game. “It was just such excitement.”
The Trojans have become accustomed to raising banners at the Anaheim Ice rink, but this title might have been the most improbable of all. USC was counted out every step of the way.
Washington led 3-1 after the first period and seemed to have all the momentum in its favor.
The Trojans notched a late second-period goal on freshman forward Nick Helmer’s power-play shot but still trailed 3-2 heading to the third period. Despite the deficit, the Trojans never felt out of the game.
“We have the most heart of any team in this league,” sophomore forward James Anderson said. “We wanted it more than anybody else.”
Fyrwald tied the game about eight minutes into the third period with his second goal of the night. His wrist shot from the right circle deflected off a Washington defenseman and past Dougan.
But the Huskies continued to push. Lofthus took a penalty with about seven minutes to play and Washington freshman Corey James scored on a scramble in front of the net, giving the Huskies a 4-3 lead.
Yet the Trojans maintained their composure, something Wilbur credited to his squad’s desire to add to the program’s storied history.
“I told them, ‘We have banners hanging in this arena, but they’re not yours, they’re somebody else’s,’” he said. “I go, ‘Go get your own damn banner.’”
Helmer tied the game at 4-4 late in the third on a beautiful backhand goal, sweeping past a Washington defender and roofing the puck past Dougan. The game seemed destined for overtime until Fyrwald scored his third goal of the game with 12.6 seconds left.
“When you take somebody whose got great athletic ability and you put that creative juice to it, he’s really difficult to stop,” Wilbur said of Fyrwald.
USC played from behind the entire tournament and faced tall odds in the process. The Trojans trailed UCLA 2-0 before coming back for a 7-4 victory.
They trailed Oregon, who they hadn’t beaten since 2007, 2-1 in the first period before scoring late in the third to win, 4-3.
Even before the tournament, USC wasn’t expected to lift the trophy. The Trojans entered as the No. 5 seed, having finished the regular season 9-19. In the tournament’s previous 14 years no team seeded lower than No. 2 had ever won.
The Trojans also ended that stretch on a four-game losing streak, dropping the Crosstown Cup to UCLA for the third time in 16 years. But Wilbur said the week off gave his team time to get over the loss to UCLA and prepare for the tournament.
He challenged his team before the tournament began, telling it: “You guys have three games left in your season. How bad do you want it? Is it worth it?”
The Trojans responded to their coach’s questions with a resounding answer.
Thanks for the article – football and basketball are the only Trojan sports that get bigger crowds – Fight on!

When I’m dealing with a tough situation, I’ve learned to take a simple approach in order to decide what to do.
First, I think of the worst-case scenario and imagine that. 
Second, I think of the best-case scenario and imagine that.
Then I decide what to do.
Intuitive, I know.
Why am I telling you this?
Well, I tried to use my usual approach when deciding what to think about USC’s appearance before the NCAA Committee on Infractions this weekend in Tempe, Ariz.
The worst-case scenario, I reckoned, is some combination of sanctions that force the football team to vacate the wins from past years, lose scholarships and a ban from postseason play for the next few seasons.
Yeah, it doesn’t look too great when you add it all up.
I ran into some trouble, though, when trying to decipher what the best case would be.
Really now, what’s a reasonable best-case scenario for the hearings?
We won’t officially know anything for at least six weeks, but let’s recap the situation briefly before we decide our mindset between now and April.
A combined eight coaches and higher-ups from USC spent three full days — something close to 36 actual hours — in a hearing, discussing alleged violations and a lack of ever-important institutional control over the last five or so years.
David Price, the NCAA vice president for enforcement services, told the New York Times it was the longest hearing he had ever been a part of.
Hmm. He’s worked for the infractions committee for 11 years now. And, mind you, these hearings usually involve more than one team over the course of a day — not one school’s two biggest programs over an entire weekend.
Think there might be something going on?
Current running backs coach Todd McNair brought his attorney along for the ride for the first two days of the hearing. Former men’s basketball coach Tim Floyd brought one of his on Saturday.
Why the legal counsel?
Firstly, McNair was former USC running back Reggie Bush’s position coach at the time when Bush  is believed to have received as much as $300,000 worth of cash and goods from potential marketing agencies.
Multiple sources have reported that McNair knew of Bush’s associations with a business called New Era Sports & Entertainment during his college career. New Era — allegedly the brainchild of Bush’s stepfather, LaMar Griffin, but funded entirely by other financiers — paid for Bush’s accommodations during multiple hotel stays and provided other items to him and his family, Yahoo! Sports first reported in 2006.
And therein lies the rub, because two New Era financiers — the ridiculously named Michael Michaels and Bush’s friend Lloyd Lake — are believed to have visited the USC locker room twice after games in the 2005 season.
Reports say that alone is grounds for a lack of institutional control ruling.
And I haven’t even gotten to Floyd yet.
The now-New Orleans Hornets assistant coach flew in to Tempe this weekend to plead his case to the NCAA committee. Floyd resigned last summer amid allegations that he paid at least $1,000 in cash to a runner for a potential agent of former USC guard O.J. Mayo and knew of money that changed hands between Mayo and the now-infamous Rodney Guillory.
Confusing, isn’t it?
But despite admitted wrongdoing and self-imposed sanctions on the basketball program last month, reports have the issue as another possible example of a lack of institutional control.
Meanwhile, Floyd’s time at USC is done. But he came to Arizona, his lawyer said, to clear his name.
How exactly did he and his attorney try to do that?
Your guess is as good as mine. As for that whole best-case scenario thing, well, you can go ahead and guess that, too.
And now you see why my approach failed.

Jio Fontan is not simply a recent transfer to USC, he’s also a star on the big screen.
Fontan led Fordham as a freshman with an average 15.3 points per game and being named the Atlantic 10 Conference men’s basketball rookie of the year but was frustrated with the Rams’ 3-25 season.  Fontan will be eligible to play for the Trojans after the first semester of the 2010-2011 season.
The documentary, produced by TeamWorks Media, features Fontan alongside his 2007-2008 teammates from St. Anthony High School.  Screened in November of 2009 at Rutgers University during the New Jersey Film Festival, the film recounts St. Anthony High School Coach Bob Hurley Sr. and his team’s journey to its 25th state championship season, a national record.
Fontan was a three-year varsity player under Hurley and helped lead the Friars to a perfect 32-0 season as a senior.  The Friars held the number one national ranking in both the USA Today 25 and the ESPN High Elite 25 polls.  However, the documentary’s main focus is not solely on Hurley and the St. Anthony High School basketball team accomplishments.
St. Anthony High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, a poor, inner-city neighborhood, has struggled to remain open because of a lack of funding.  The film examines the players’ lives and how they react to hardships with the help of Hurley.
“This documentary is a great way to make everyone around the country aware of the mission of St. Anthony,” Hurley told the website PeterRobertCasey.com.  “The kids here need this school. They need a place that keeps them off the street, but every year it’s a struggle just to keep our doors open.”
The documentary includes interviews from acclaimed basketball coaches who praise Hurley and his program.
“A lot of the kids playing basketball are trying to survive, they’re trying to figure out how they can turn their dreams into reality.  That’s what Bob Hurley does, and that’s what St. Anthony’s does,” said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski in the film’s trailer.
The Street Stops Here is set to premiere on PBS on Wednesday, March 31 at 10pm.

Without much fanfare or the typical breaking news flash on the ticker of an ESPN telecast, USC quietly made another splash in filling its coaching vacancies Thursday afternoon.
Clay Helton is not a name that jumps off the page the first time you see it. He doesn’t have the championship hardware Monte Kiffin does, he doesn’t have the recruiting credentials that Ed Orgeron has displayed these past few weeks and he doesn’t have the experience of working in a BCS conference. But despite what he lacks, the 37-year-old makes up for it with his knowledge and versatility.
The newest member of the Trojans staff is a jack-of-all-trades. He was hired back in 2000 by the University of Memphis to serve as the running backs coach, but as the program soon found out, Helton’s expertise extended far beyond the running game. After three seasons, he began working as the receivers coach, where he groomed three of the school’s most promising wideouts in decades:  Maurice Jones, Ryan Scott and Duke Calhoun.
As the Tigers receivers posted historic numbers for the school in 2003, with records in both completions and receiving yardage, Helton’s coaching prowess was finally displayed.
But not until 2007 did the former Houston University quarterback receive proper recognition for his offensive ingenuity and coaching prowess. In January of 2007, he was promoted to be the program’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, a role that allowed him to flourish under his own rules.
In his first season, with a relatively inexperienced offensive line, the Tigers adapted quickly to Helton’s new schemes, as they finished No. 13 in the nation in passing offense — marking the first time since 1999 the team reached the Top 25 in an offensive category. Despite major injuries at the quarterback position in 2008, Helton’s unit finished the season ranked 13th in the nation in total offense, in what can only be described as a testament to the work ethic the former-UH assistant coach instilled in his players.
While his list of accolades doesn’t include BCS appearances (five total bowl appearances, two in the New Orleans bowl) or coaching a Heisman Trophy finalist like a Matt Leinart or Reggie Bush (although he mentored DeAngelo Williams, who finished seventh in the 2005 voting), his knack for teaching student-athletes to grasp an offense as he sees it, makes him more than admirable fit with the Trojans.
His resume might not make you “ooh” and “ahh” now, but as young talents like Matt Barkley, Brice Butler and Marc Tyler mature before your very eyes in the years to come, remember Helton’s name and the impact he likely had on it all.
Since when did the University of $candal and Corruption deal with “student-athletes?”

In a sold-out show presented by USC Spectrum Saturday night, multitalented musician and indie folk sensation Andrew Bird brought a highly diverse slice of the student body out to Bovard Auditorium to experience the prodigy’s offbeat music.
Soaring · Proficient in several instruments including violin and guitar, Bird uses pedals and samplers to improvise and rework songs in his live performances. His last album, Noble Beast, was released last year. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Despite the show’s slated start time 8 p.m., students began to flood the venue about an hour before. The concert drew a number of undergraduates to the upscale Bovard Auditorium who otherwise might not have visited.
Bird began his set, pleasing a crowd that apparently appreciated his punctuality. But before he even started to play, the silence indicated that this woukd not be an ordinary gig.
It was not the type of concert to camp out for, sacrificing a day to get a good place; it was also not the type of concert with wildly screaming fans. Somehow, the Andrew Bird concert ended up like a lecture, devoid of everything that makes a rock concert a rock concert.
Bird himself was mesmerizing and his musical talent, including an uncanny ability to turn layered violin loops into songs, was more than captivating. In conjunction with his dreamy storytelling and eclectic talents — whistling and playing the glockenspiel, most notably — the concert seemed to have the makings of a perfectly memorable night.
It’s not as if the event was unsuccessful, just that the vibe was more akin to one of intellectual awe rather than one of emotional attachment to the music being played. In his position on Bovard’s center stage, Bird appeared less indie rock star and more guest speaker.
The fact that Bird was alone on stage probably contributed to the lecture-like experience. He had no drummer or pianist, both of which he sometimes uses in live shows. His speeches, although full of wit and charisma, also added to the feeling that the show was a demonstration and not a music concert. Bird even told the audience he was nervous because he was in a school.
Saturday night’s Bovard show was an especially significant one for Bird, as it was the last on his tour.
Andrew Bird's Saturday night performance at Bovard Auditorium was the last on his tour. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
“This is an important show and I really want to feel good after this one,” Bird said.
It’s very likely that he did feel good after the performance; Bird gave two encores. But the performance overall seemed to lack true emotion, at least from the crowd. The student body was somehow desensitized, perhaps from too much time spent amid the glamour and overstimulation of Los Angeles.
It even felt like a history lesson, as Bird played songs from his days in a previous band called Bowl of Fire. If anyone were not familiar with this earlier project, USC Spectrum had prepared a very ostentatious pamphlet that explained everything about its guest and his history.
All the same, USC Spectrum clearly knew what it was doing, as the performance sold out.
Toward the end, Bird’s lecture grew tedious, his formula for building songs became predictable and parts of the crowd seemed bored enough to fall asleep.
Although his violin virtuosity still shone, it became boring to hear him create loops over and over. The most dynamic parts of the performance ended up being the ones in which he serenaded everyone conventionally, with only his voice and his guitar.
USC has always been an awkward locale for musicians and music-lovers alike. It’s not a bad place for students, as the university does arrange numerous performances each semester, but the performances are sometimes confusing. The performances either end up as quasi-lectures — Bird on Saturday, Rufus Wainwright and Julieta Venegas in past semesters — or very commercialized hit parades — Gym Class Heroes and Hellogoodbye, for instance. With such a diverse student body to cater to, Program Board, USC Spectrum and Visions and Voices have their work cut out for themto find a happy medium that appeals to all.
This article is one more reason that the Daily Trojan is only good for wiping oneself after using the bathroom.  The reviews always suck and provide no real insight (Disappointed that Andrew Bird wasn’t a rock concert?  The Lab is a terrible place to get food, huh? Hmm…) and they never publish anything worth reading, unless you’re of course talking about the candidates that they endorse for USG elections… they always seem to get good coverage.  This while actual news that the student body would benefit from hearing goes unreported.  Good game, Daily Trojan.  You deserve an F. For fail.
It’s fine if you didn’t like the concert, but I’ve seen 8 year olds construct better arguments than this.
devoid of everything that makes a rock concert a rock concert??? Andrew Bird is not a rock artist that came to give a rock concert.
 I, like the person above, was silent because of my complete awe. There’s not much room for “WOO”s and throwing up the horns at a show like this. Your critique draws from these conventional assumptions from the get-go. The show was incredible. Judging by the two standing ovations, I’m sure that everyone else at the auditorium would agree.
What show were you at?
I was silent because I was completely mesmerized along with a majority of the audience.

Our motto was “No man left behind,” but in an ocean of people packed like the Tokyo subway during rush hour, these efforts almost proved futile.
Linking arms with my traveling companions, I attempted to squeeze through the crowds in Venice, Italy’s St. Mark’s Square. The people have gathered here for the Carnevale di Venezia — or Venice Carnival — a festival where Venetians and tourists alike flock to the city donning their most ornate costumes and masks to take part in the annual pre-Lent celebration.
But Carnevale isn’t just the place to see intricate masks and lively parades. If you like meeting new people when you travel, it’s the perfect time to get up close and almost too personal with the true residents of Venice — the tourists.
From the cute Japanese girls sporting hot-pink cameras and peace signs to the French couple on holiday for the weekend, people from all over the world arrive to watch their imaginations come to life.
Only about 65,000 people actually live in Venice’s historic center, but with millions of backpackers and sightseers passing through the city each year, Venice relies on tourism for commerce and the week of Carnevale is no exception.
An event that has been heavily revived in the past two decades, Carnevale spans the 10 days preceding Fat Tuesday, with the closest American equivalent being New Orleans’ Mardi Gras celebration. Carnevale is meant to be a time of celebration before Lent, the somber period of Christian abstinence, which makes sense since the Latin root for the word Carnevale literally means “the removal of” or “farewell.”
The first Carnevale celebration mentioning the use of costume is believed to have taken place in the late 13th century. Carnevale masks, traditionally made out of papier-mâché, were worn to hide the identities of carousers engaged in pleasure and debauchery. They were meant to act as equalizers, allowing wearers to break social rules without fear of judgment.
More recently, however, Carnevale seems more about convincing tourists to loosen up their coin purses than to celebrate Venice’s religious and cultural heritage. Nearly all of the balls and masquerades are privately organized and cost anywhere from 50 euros for one serving hot chocolate and sweets to 470 euros for a complete masquerade ball in Zenobio Palace.
Restaurants near Rialto Bridge, the oldest bridge across the city’s Grand Canal, offer special tourist menus that advertise three-course meals for about 14 euros, instead of the regular entrée price of 20 euros and up.
Luckily, if you know where to go, you can also find cheap eats. Pizza al Volo in St. Margherita Square has pizza for 2 euros a slice and is centrally located to provide access to the free activities centered St. Mark’s Square.
On Sunday morning, my friends and I rushed off the vaporetto, a Venetian water bus, trying to make it in time for the Flight of the Angel, a tradition where a woman is attached to a cable and “flies” from St. Mark’s bell tower into the crowd. But with narrow streets and impossible crowds, I could barely make out the tiny figure before she was swallowed up by a swarm of onlookers.
Refusing to be packed like sardines any longer, we walked toward the more breathable side streets. True to the atmosphere, we stumbled across a couple of face painters (who adorned my face with purple and gold feathers), children throwing confetti and even a bomb scare from a mysterious suitcase that had been left behind.
Herded out of the area by security, we headed back toward St. Mark’s Square and onto the roof of St. Mark’s Basilica — an old cathedral famous for its Byzantine architecture and mosaics — to watch the parade.
Performers in the day’s main event, Marie’s Parade, drummed a slow beat as a spectacle of people was ushered through the streets of Venice. Dressed as extravagant noblemen and women wielding stallion-printed black-and-gold flags, they marched amid spectators wearing robes that were equally as impressive. Fancy satin, feathers and lace adorned even the smallest of children watching the parade, who sat comfortably above the crowd on the shoulders of fathers dressed to match.
Even Noah’s Ark, the Joker from Batman and the Smurfs had costumed representatives that would put the most enthusiastic trick-or-treating child to shame. They proudly displayed their panache, pausing occasionally to snap photos with the common merrymakers.
When the sun set, though, much of the crowd dispersed to their homes — or, more likely, their hotel rooms — leaving a lonely, dedicated few to carry on the festivities.
And just like that, it was over.
The pebbled streets once dotted with people were deserted the next day. Only the confetti stuck in the crevices of wet pavement remained as evidence of the magic from the day before.
So while Venice might very well be for tourists, it’s also a place where Carnevale attendees can disguise themselves in masks and adorned dress, making their dreams came to life — even if only for a day.

Huddled beneath large tents to escape the rain while nursing extremely overpriced cocktails, some of Los Angeles’ most enthusiastic art patrons gathered at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA for a members-only evening of art, music and communal participation.
Experimental · The evening’s musical guest Lucky Dragons — including Sarah Rara — handed out instruments to audience members. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
The party, which occurred Saturday, was to celebrate MOCA’s newest exhibit, “Collection: MOCA’s First Thirty Years.”
Although MOCA’s Grand Avenue location will include an extension of the exhibit with works covering earlier 20th century modern art, the exhibit featured at the Geffen Contemporary brings together nearly 500 works from MOCA’s expansive permanent collection and spans a surprisingly short range of international contemporary art from the past 30 years.
Displayed in the new exhibit are works by well-known players in the contemporary art world — including Barbara Kruger, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Raymond Pettibon — as well as pieces from new and relatively unknown artists.
The event also featured a new-concept performance by the Los Angeles-based experimental music and art collective Lucky Dragons, helmed by key members Luke Fischbeck and Sarah Rara, a first-year MFA student in USC’s Roski School of Fine Arts.
Called Live Sprawl, the performance encapsulated the entirety of the event with multiple musical performances scattered throughout the night, large-scale video installations and ambient noise amplified throughout the outdoor gallery space.
Throughout the evening, members of Lucky Dragons roamed the gallery and outside space with saxophones and percussion instruments, setting up spontaneous jam sessions before packing up and heading to a different location within the museum.
Also featured outside the gallery was local synthesizer impresario David Scott Stone, famous for his musical collaborations with bands such as The Melvins and No Age.
Stone allowed museum goers to tinker and experiment with an impressive modular synthesizer he built himself to produce various waveforms and sounds from the machine. For a good portion of the night, groups huddled around the large machine, patching in cables and twirling various knobs to achieve a desired musical effect.
Later in the evening, Fischbeck gathered onstage in the outdoor gallery with several other members of the Lucky Dragons’ collective to begin the capstone performance of the evening.
Opening with an ambient, drone-filled piece characterized by off-beat drumming and reverb-laden vocals, the band began to set the scene for what would become an immensely captivating performance.
Skeptical attendees initially watched and stood around bewildered — was this the entirety of Lucky Dragons’ long-hyped conjunction between music and art? The partnership between the group and MOCA began to seem like an odd fit.
Yet, soon after the group began, members of the Lucky Dragons’ collective hopped offstage and roamed through the crowd, handing out an odd variety of instruments to unsuspecting viewers.
While most of the impromptu band members received percussion instruments such as Tibetan bells, gongs and tambourines, a small group of viewers huddled near the front of the stage were given a series of long, tightly coiled wires connected to a small input box which fed to a laptop. This contraption has become a staple — and a somewhat legendary component — of the Lucky Dragons’ performances.
Relying on MIDI technology and electrical resistance, the wires transform into a bizarre touch-sensitive sampler in which direct contact with one of the wires — as well as direct contact with whoever holds a wire — will generate various forms of melodic feedback.
The collective aptly calls this heavily audience participation-oriented act “Make a Baby.”
With only minimal guidance from Fischbeck, the selected audience members soon realized what the series of wires were capable of, and it only took minutes before the group of complete strangers held hands and connected the collection of strands together in varying patterns to produce a well-coordinated cacophony of sound.
Anderson and Fischbeck continued to roam around the gallery, passing out instruments and encouraging others to pick one up. The room soon became awash with a sonic melee. In one corner, a group of women took turns hitting a gong while other participants created melodies on their free recorders and watched the members of the “Make a Baby” group move their arms in bizarre patterns in order to trigger the feedback loops.
With this swift transition from solo musical performance into full-on participatory experience, Lucky Dragons allowed the audience of art appreciators to become the art itself. All of the elements of the performance for the rest of its 30 minutes were controlled not by the musical group but by the event’s attendees instead.
When the band finally silenced its laptops and drumming, many who had received instruments from the band continued to play amid enthusiastic applause from the audience until, one by one, the instruments were voluntarily returned to the stage, and the music vanished as quickly as it had developed.
i’m sorry i missed this happening.  the report of it encourages me that the contemporary art world is not as dead as it looks, lost in multiplicity, ignored by all but participants in art.
with computers and television i think people are being drowned in media in their rabbit-holes.
now my ears are pricked up and i will be watching MOCA for future shindigs.
i can’t help but be reminded of the world cafe in the village, global village and “the factory”.
this could be a sign of the revival of real experiences.

While studying the fall of ancient civilizations in my environmental studies class we learned that in times of collapse, people with specialized jobs are the first to go because they are poorly equipped to fend for themselves when systems they’ve learned to rely on fail.
Daily Trojan | Sullivan Brown
We might not live in ancient civilizations anymore, but economic turmoil and political strife are leading many to play it safe and prepare for the worst. We deliberate over the best possible paths to future security and, with college lasting only four expensive years, our choice of studies can’t be made flippantly.
Is majoring in something specialized too big a risk in these weak economic times? Can we trust traditional majors to sustain us or should we consider those less traditional?
It seems interdisciplinary studies could be the defense against specialization. A degree in interdisciplinary studies is a relatively new concept that has only recently begun to grow; the number of interdisciplinary bachelor’s degrees awarded was only about 6,000 in 1971 compared to 34,000 in 2007, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics.
While those numbers seem miniscule compared to the highest degree-awarding majors — business administration (327,000), social sciences (164,000) and education (105,000) — the increase is pretty impressive.
Although interdisciplinary studies allow students to pursue multiple complex fields of academia, most universities are just now beginning to incorporate the system. Many students would prefer to declare a well-established major they might only have a lukewarm interest in for job security reasons, rather than risk pursuing something unique they’re truly interested in that doesn’t have the same credibility.
However, playing it safe and falling back on traditional options isn’t always the best decision. Interdisciplinary majors offer the opportunity to study something that piques your interest and becomes a compelling conversation starter that shows off how unique you are (hint: job interviews).
Non-traditional majors at USC like narrative studies; philosophy, politics and law; and health and humanity are authorized across multiple departments, while the make-your-own-major Interdisciplinary Studies option exists “for students with a focused interest in a topic which requires study from more than one disciplinary perspective.” These kinds of majors are burgeoning projects in academia, and it isn’t quite certain what futures these degrees hold.
Richard Fliegel, director of Interdisciplinary Studies at USC, is optimistic about the expansive possibilities of interdisciplinary majors. Fliegel asserts that interdisciplinary students are often the most motivated and competitive students, and their focused, original studies often distinguish them from other candidates for jobs and graduate programs.
Rebuffing the idea that pursuing a non-traditional major could be risky in these economic times, Fliegel said, “In times of uncertainty, there are no sure bets … [One that is] safest is choosing something [students] love and excel at.”
It’s a challenging task to take part in fledgling courses, but the Interdisciplinary Studies program has the possibility of bringing about entire departments, similar to the  way the American Studies and Ethnicity department began at USC.
Above all, Fliegel emphasizes that “interdisciplinary studies are a demonstration of intellectual flexibility,” which he argues is a crucial aspect in surviving after graduation.
Rachel Horn, a sophomore majoring in narrative studies, said she loves the direction of her major. Fearing the decline of the publishing industry she originally wanted to work in, Horn said the narrative studies major prepares her for new industries invested in storytelling and puts her at the forefront of innovative developments of story-related markets.
“I feel like I have an interesting title that employers will be interested in hearing about,” Horn said.
It would be a wonderful world if we could study whatever we wanted with full economic support. CNN recently did a report on some of the most unusual degree programs, ranging from a master’s program in the music of The Beatles at Liverpool Hope University to a master’s in fine arts program in puppet arts at the University of Connecticut.
Imagine telling your parents, “Mom, Dad, I’ve found my life’s calling, and it’s in puppetry.” If it weren’t for the need to have a career that can keep a roof over our heads, many of us might pursue Ph.D.s in such unconventional fields.
Choosing a major, like any decision in life, has its risks no matter what major students choose.
Selecting studies outside the norm could result in something personally meaningful, but today’s economic climate means more work to make potential employers aware of what new skills unorthodox studies can equip students with.
Although a degree in something like puppetry might not create job security, choosing something non-
traditional that demonstrates a capacity to be passionate just might be that secret weapon to the dogfight that is job searching. College is one of the best times for exploring different fields and some risks are worth taking to find studies that suit us just right.

Most of us have had the experience of driving around on a hot day searching for a shady parking spot. But imagine a scenario where, instead of avoiding the blistering sun, you welcome it, knowing your car — even its air conditioning — is solar-powered.
Solar energy has the potential to revolutionize our lifestyles.  Now that the X Prize Foundation — a non-profit that rewards and encourages cross-disciplinary technological research with the clear ability to benefit humankind —  has launched the third X Prize Lab in the country at USC, our students have a better chance than ever to play a part in the realization of solar energy’s promise.
But although the benefits of this undertaking are astronomical, it’s important to recognize that in scientific efforts intended to directly improve society — referred to as applied research — the importance of pure research sometimes gets overlooked. Although the research types often overlap, pure research is primarily motivated by plain curiosity instead of altruism.
We should caution ourselves against neglecting the less glamorous form of research.
Pure research rarely sounds as wonderful or important as applied research, so the latter gets all the media attention and the funding. Solar energy is extremely important,  but if we don’t make sure to gain a thorough knowledge of its necessary, potentially banal-sounding components before trying to save the world with it, it’s actually kind of (ironically) self-serving.
Matteo Marjoram | Daily Trojan
According to the foundation’s website, the goal is to “drive innovators to solve some of the greatest challenges facing the world today.” A noble mission indeed, and addressing the solar-energy problem, which has recently been identified as one of the main Grand Challenges of the National Academy of Engineering, in endlessly sunny Southern California seems appropriate.
It’s not surprising that USC was chosen for this laboratory, considering the prestige and quality of its engineering and business schools. The campus is also the site of an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy with a focus on solar-energy conversion and solid-state lighting. The other two X Prize labs are at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Washington.
Every hour, enough sunlight falls on the planet’s surface to meet the energy demands of the entire human race for a year, according to the DOE. It’s our most abundant energy source, and unlike burning fossil fuels, it’s environmentally friendly. Considering the increasingly apparent effects of global warming and the fact that Los Angeles suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the country, it’s especially crucial for us to explore this alternative energy source.
The problem is that we haven’t quite figured out how to harness the sun’s energy efficiently. Most solar cells, from thin-film to mono-crystalline, have relatively low efficiencies. The efficiencies of organic solar cells are even lower. Photons, which carry different amounts of energy depending on the solar spectrum wavelength they correspond with, need to be absorbed into the solar cell’s semi-conductive material to generate electricity.
So far, the materials that scientists have tried using for absorption are either not efficient enough, too expensive to be economically viable for mass production, or both. Many of the photons simply pass through or get reflected off of the material.
Although the solutions to such problems will be able to further aid applied research endeavors, we must not overlook the fact that pure research laid out the majority of the groundwork.
The X Prize Lab at USC shows promise because students and professors from the Viterbi School of Engineering and the Marshall School of Business will take a close, critical look at all of the existing solar-
energy science and the current market structure to come up with recommendations for solar challenges that can be funded as X Prizes. One of the most effective ways to make progress in any field is to converge operations in this cross-disciplinary way so that the strengths of one discipline can compensate for the weaknesses of another.
The university is fortunate to have such a quality combination of assets.
But as I said before, although it’s important to make sure our research ideas are marketable, we need to keep in mind the importance of science that doesn’t necessarily sound like a be-all, end-all breakthrough.
For example, we might be quick to fund a study that’s meant to discern the correlation between household smoking and childhood asthma. But if we do find a correlation, we might immediately assume that smoking causes asthma. Unless we do a not-so-wonderful-sounding, more technical study that separately exposes rats to environmental stressors and cigarette smoke, and directly observes the physiological effects, we won’t know for sure.
Solar energy has the potential to solve a lot of our problems but first we have to solve the problems with gathering solar energy itself. It’s the responsibility of our students and professors to evaluate each idea on its own merits, and to keep in mind that just because something doesn’t necessarily sound life-altering, doesn’t mean that it’s not.

In January, Pete Carroll broke the hearts of Trojan fans when he announced he was leaving USC in order to enter the NFL as the new head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.
On Saturday, Feb. 20 the ex-football coach returned to the city he left behind, but did not stop by USC’s campus.
Carroll announced on his Twitter page that he was in town to attend the comedy show for his charity, A Better LA. The proceeds were sent to both the charity as well as to the Red Cross to help fund its relief efforts in Haiti after a devastating earthquake struck the island last month.
The show was titled “Make It Better: An Evening of Comedy with Will Ferrell and Friends.” Will Ferrell served as the headliner for the event, which took place at the Nokia Theatre in L.A. Live.
Carroll founded the charity in 2003. It is aimed at decreasing violence on L.A. streets and making a better city overall. The charity brings together different groups, such as community leaders, members of law enforcement and government agencies.
Carroll appeared in a promotional video for the show with comedians Rob Riggie and Aubrey Plaza. Both of them also appeared in the show, as did others such as Tenacious D and comedian Nick Swardson.

Oh, Lady Gaga — as she continues her crazy antics with catchy tunes and outrageous outfits, the young star has an iron grip on the music world. In “Boys, Boys, Boys” she croons don’t forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray. Really now?
In all likelihood, she probably forgot it at MAC.
The starlet has teamed up with ’80s pop icon Cyndi Lauper and the eye-candy, powerhouse makeup store MAC to create two new lipstick colors. But these are no ordinary weapons for the artificial coloring of puckered lips. All proceeds from the sales of either lipstick go to the MAC AIDS Fund by way of the VIVA GLAM program, which was established in 1994 as a way to help those affected by HIV/AIDS. The program started with the sale of lipstick and has so far raised an impressive $160 million for the MAC AIDS fund.
With its new project, MAC crosses generations and gives humanitarianism a glamourous sheen. Each celebrity gets her own custom-named sleek black tube, red on the inside with their respective signatures. At $14 apiece, you can choose Cyndi Lauper’s “coral-red” concoction or Lady’s Gaga’s “cool blue-pink” mixture.
The products will be on sale only for a limited time online and in store. Lady Gaga’s shade is currently sold out online.
With the new promotion, faithful customers can now splurge on a new color and give back while occasional customers and those who see MAC as a guilty pleasure can indulge knowing that their purchase helps those who truly need it. Although the lipsticks may seem overpriced, the opportunity to help others seems priceless. The lipsticks come with the promise of not only perhaps feeling a little bit like Lady Gaga or Cyndia Lauper when you leave the house, but perhaps feeling like you also did a little bit for the world.
