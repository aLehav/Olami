Abe Vigoda
Described by Pitchfork as possessing a “love of goth and coldwave,” this Chino quartet garnered raves with its 2010 LP Crush. Once described as tropical punk, they have wrapped swarthy reverb around their guitars, and front man Michael Vidal sings with the traumatized temperament of one who has endured the unimaginable, and savored every second of it.
 
Puro Instinct
With undulating guitar riffs, echoed vocals and enough synth melodies to score a John Hughes picture, these Los Angeles natives got positive feedback South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) and are currently ripping up the net with their shimmering sounds. The group is fronted by sisters Piper and Skylar Kaplan.
 
Sister Crayon
Coming straight out of Sacramento, this chillwave four-piece are making waves in the indie world. Borrowing sounds from Thom Yorke, Glass Candy and others, the band spins infectious, soulful melodies, guided by Terra Lopez’s gossamer voice.
 
Julianna Barwick
Making it her goal to fuse a cappella singing and electronic music, Julianna Barwick creates a sound equal parts haunting and captivating. The Brooklyn-based singer was recently recognized my Pitchfork magazine and given the title of Best New Music, an accolade that probably comes from Barwick’s singing talent and unique personality. Catch the gal before she goes off to tour with the elusive Esben and the Witch.
 
Brook and River
Santa-Cruz-hailing soft rockers Brook and River are perfect for a lazy, warm Sunday afternoon. Their soft rock sound with a country twang creates smooth tunes that let you bop your head along as you please. The trio, however, also delves into complex romances and other life issues, presenting the right balance between carefree tunes and heartfelt lyricism.
 
Ana Caravelle
Classically trained in harp and with a soft, endearing voice, this folk singer has a sound that is rare to hear in the music world nowadays. Lullaby-like yet genuinely honest, the tracks seem to transport you to another time period altogether. The soothing melodies are sure to put up a fight against even your most stressful thoughts.

Alric Van graduated from USC in May 2010 and now works as a business analyst for BP. Van, who studied chemical engineering at USC, sat down with the Daily Trojan to talk about his experiences.
Alric Van
Daily Trojan: What does your position at BP entail?
Alric Van: I forecast gasoline and diesel demands, and I ensure smooth operations at our field distribution terminals on the West Coast. I also work with the refineries to help them change their output to meet the demand in their region.
DT: Did you always know you wanted to work in the oil industry?
Van: It was kind of by chance. I was a sophomore and looking at internship opportunities and Valero popped up. I interned with Valero as an engineer and I really liked learning about the oil industry. BP has given me the opportunity to check out the business side of the oil business.
DT: What about the oil industry interests you?
Van: I find the oil industry really interesting because it’s an essential commodity and it affects the every day consumer. You have the drivers, but it also affects the state and even the government at the national level. [Gasoline is] important on almost any level of society.
DT: Have you found it difficult to work for BP after the oil spill?
Van: I am proud to work for BP. I think we did the right thing after the spill happened, but I have noticed a lot of changes in the organization. There’s a noticeable emphasis on safety now. When our CEO says we are even more focused on safety, he’s not just giving lip service.
DT: How has your USC education prepared you for your job?
Van: It taught me how to learn and that’s helped me pick things up along the way in my current job. The USC experience overall taught me how to network with people, and that’s a pretty big part of my job.
DT: What did you enjoy most about USC?
Van: Definitely being a part of the USC Dragon Boat Team was an amazing time. We became like a family.  I loved being at USC, and it’s definitely more fun than working. I love my job, but I think my time at USC was much more fun.
DT: What advice would you give fellow Trojans?
Van: You have to believe in yourself. Once you start working you have to really know what you want and follow your own career path. Don’t let someone else write your life.
These interviews with young alums are great.  Nice insights into how college students start their professional careers.
Yes, USCDB. go Alric
Wooo go Alric!

James Owens, assistant professor of clinical management communication at USC, began writing The World Is Just A Book Away, but instead of finishing the book, Owens chose to create a non-profit organization of the same name to give kids in Indonesia books and libraries.
The World is Just a Book Away was founded by Owens in 2008. Since then, it has built 47 libraries in Indonesia and provided 25,000 children with 45,000 books. Discussion about creating a USC club began at the beginning of the semester.
The nonprofit’s mission to give children in Indonesia books was met with enthusiasm from students. Students in response have recently founded a The World Is Just A Book Away Club USC chapter to work with the nonprofit organization.
Owens founded the organization after visiting more than 50 countries. Upon seeing the devastated communities, he decided it would be helpful to provide books to children.
“I’ve seen children who have access to no books and few resources and I know that books provide a whole world of dreams and adventure and hope to children,” Owens said. “So I thought, let me build a library for kids.”
The nonprofit quickly garnered support from USC faculty and alumni, many of whom sit on the organization’s board.
“James has an innate ability to mobilize people quickly, and I share his vision in believing that all children, regardless of where they live and what their socioeconomic situation is, should have access to books and education,” said Jonathan Schwartz, a board member for The World Is Just A Book Away and USC alumni.
Billy Buffington, a junior majoring in business administration and human performance, and Alex Schaffhausen, a senior majoring in economics and biological sciences, founded the club after learning about the organization in Owens’ class.
Schaffhausen said he became involved with the organization because he saw other children were not given the same opportunities he was and wanted to change that.
“My parents have always taught me the importance of education … I’ve traveled to third world countries and I realized that a lot of kids don’t have the same opportunities to go to school,” Schaffhausen said. “I want to do my part in helping other children have the same opportunities I have.”
The club, which now has 12 members, hopes to have 30 by the end of the year, according to Buffington. Buffington said any USC student can join.
To raise money and increase awareness about the club, the group will be holding a 5K run Sunday, April 10. Every dollar donated is the equivalent of one book for the kids in Indonesia.
The club spent two months finding sponsors, making signs, sending out emails and meeting with university officials to get the course for the 5K approved.
“Most sources I found recommend anywhere from three to six months for preparation,” Buffington said. “Neither Alex nor I had ever run a 5K, let alone organize one, so we pretty much started from scratch. We did a lot of research online and contacted a lot of runners.”
The club hopes to build a library in Padang, Indonesia with the money raised from the run. The library, which will be called The World Is Just A Book Away 5K 2011 Library in honor of the event, will be in Padang because the city has been severely ravaged with mudslides and earthquakes over the last few years, according to Buffington.
The area is in severe poverty, and Buffington said it is the belief of the organization that education is the key to ending that poverty. Books and libraries are necessary for the children in Indonesia to get an education.
Buffington said the most difficult task of putting together the 5K was convincing people to run.
“We were unsure how much interest the student body would have,” Buffington said. “Professor James Owens was instrumental in helping us get a large number of participants. Through the goodwill of students and non-students, and a bit of nagging, we now have 115 participants signed up.”
The World Is Just A Book Away Club at USC is the first club at a university to work with The World Is Just A Book Away organization.
“We have the opportunity to go to a great school and I think it’s a good thing to share our opportunities with others and to benefit and make the world a better place,” Schaffhausen said. “Education is one of the key ingredients for success and I think it’s great that USC students can share their opportunities with others.”
Buffington and Schaffhausen both hope the club will spread to other universities.
“The long term goal is to eventually have more of these clubs at universities around the state, around the country and that one day having a The World Is Just A Book Away Club is common place at most universities,” Buffington said.
Though Buffington and Schaffhausen do not yet know how they will spread the club to other schools, they hope that by reaching out to friends and other advocacy groups, students will want to create a club to benefit The World Is Just A Book Away.

Students at the last ally discussion of the year concluded USC is fairly accepting of LGBT students, but suggested the university focus on educating students about sexual identity and gender to further improve its relationship with the LGBT community.
Specifically, the panel, which consisted of Sara Parker, a graduate student in the School of Policy, Planning, and Development; Julianne Gale, a graduate student in the School of Theatre; Nick Powers, a sophomore studying in East Asian area studies; and Kristopher Patrick, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences discussed ways professors and the Greek community can help.
Although some houses on The Row have an ally chair that works with the LGBT community, Greek members hope all houses will eventually have one.
The ally chair is not an official position, and the duties carried out by the member are added to existing chair positions. The ally chair attends QuASA meetings, and serves as a person in the house questioning or LGBT members can talk to in complete secrecy. Currently, Alpha Delta Pi sorority and Delta Gamma sorority have the position.
“Although I wouldn’t say it’s necessary, I think it’s a good idea,” said Mattie Hanson, social chair of Phi Delta Theta who is openly gay. “It doesn’t just help gay Greeks, but all gay people on campus and their perceptions about the Greek community … A lot of gay guys and girls don’t know they can rush because they assume that being gay means they can’t go Greek.”
Jackie Matthews, a junior majoring in public relations and gender studies and executive vice president of Panhellenic, came up with the idea of an ally chair for sororities. Although she wishes every chapter would have someone in this position, she said that it is not possible without the approval of nationals.
“I think requiring it would ruin the spirit of the initiative,” Matthews said. “We can’t require it anyway because every chapter’s nationals is in charge of what positions each house has. But we heavily encourage it and work with the chapters as much as we can.”
In the meantime, Matthews is organizing different programs that will foster tolerance and acceptance during Greek Week to raise awareness because there are no official ally chairs.
Some students at the panel expressed concern with how faculty and staff have treated queer issues within the classroom. Students said some professors have failed to correct comments that promoted gay stereotypes, while others have assumed an attitude of heteronormativity, that it is culturally normal to be straight, in class discussions about diversity or socio-economics.
“There have been instances where classes talk about socio-economic topics and focus on race or class, but they never mention queer issues,” Gale said.
The panel also agreed that USC needs to promote education about sexual identity and gender with more panel discussions, workshops, guest speakers and general interaction with the LGBT community.
“I see a lot of ignorance [among students]. USC should be teaching students about different aspects of our community and asking what stereotypes can we shatter,” Powers said.
Suggestions were made on how USC could go about educating its students, including creating LGBT liaisons with various USC organizations, changing the LGBT center to the LGBTQ center to include queer students, building gender neutral bathrooms and housing and even providing information in the USC Housing packet for freshmen that addresses having a gay roommate.
“There’s a confusion about how students ask about someone’s sexual identity, a problem that could be addressed with enough information and education,” Parker said.
In addition to education, students suggested the university create places on campus, either in organizations or classrooms, where LGBT students can feel safe to discuss topics they feel are relevant. One student suggested the Safe Zone program many other universities use, which trains faculty and staff to be allies. If the professor has the Safe Zone sticker on his or her office door, students can feel free to discuss LGBT issues.
“If this program were implemented at USC, the teacher would be obliged to be against homophobia,” Powers said.
Although most LGBT students said they feel integrated in campus life, the panel made it clear that there is still a long way to go before people are fully aware and respectful of the LGBT community.
Nick, thank you for this article and your efforts to create equality and a better understanding of LGBT issues. Suni, why would you assume that DG or other NPC groups would not support these initiatives? Delta Gama has no homophobic “values of membership”, and in fact many regional and executive leaders are trying to find a way to better support and welcome queer members. It’s too bad this is not yet an international norm for Panhellenic, but thank goodness DG has stepped up as a leader, while others  in the community apparently rest in hatred and fear of queer women. Think there are no queer women already hiding within USC sororities? Think again. Good work ADPi, DG, and Theta.
“In 2004, the LGBT Resource Center created a university-wide ‘safe zone’ program for supportive Allies of the LGBT Community called the Faculty & Staff Ally Program.” 
The safe zone program is already being implemented here at USC. Let’s not give the Queer community less credit than it deserves.
Also, this article mentions the importance of creating a “safe-space” for discussion on LGBT topics. Which again, the university already has done. There are many branches underneath QuASA. Currently, there is a confidential discussion group on Monday Nights called uRap. At uRap, the members usually have a clear topic for the evening to discuss, but there are often “youRaps” where the night is open to whatever topic the attendees would like to address. 
http://sait.usc.edu/lgbt/signature-programs/university-rap-urap.aspx
sorry about the safe zone info mix up, i didn’t know USC already did it. and i hadn’t mentioned it in terms of our community, i go to urap frequently, so i know some of the programs we have. i mentioned safe zone 1) b/c i didn’t know anything about how usc does it, and 2) for ppl who don’t know what it means (and b/c it’s another thing we’re trying to get the Greek community to do)
and suni, Allies aren’t queer, they’re heterosexual by definition. AND, theta’s hosting a queer panelist for their PHC speaker series, so suck it up and deal with the fact that PHC as a body is an Ally.
I understand ADPi having one of those queer leadership positions, but DG? I thought you were better than that, DG. Theta and Kappa would never do something that was so blatantly incongruent with the values of their membership.

Two USC administrators seized the opportunity at yesterday’s Take Back the Night rally to address the recent scandals that have rocked the USC community.
Speak out · Provost Elizabeth Garrett spoke at the Take Back the Night rally Thursday night. Garrett said she is proud of students for standing together in spite of recent events. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan 
Provost Elizabeth Garrett, the first woman to hold the office of provost at USC, kicked off the rally in front of Tommy Trojan by saying she is proud of how students have come together in the wake of the viral Kappa Sigma email that referred to women as “targets.”
“We have here a commitment to free speech and robust discourse, but also a commitment to power, safety and civil discourse,” said Garrett, whose appearance at Take Back the Night was unannounced. “What happens in a university that can sometimes be difficult is when these commitments come into tension. We’ve seen that over the past few days because of a repugnant, objectionable and vile email that goes against our commitment to respect.”
Garrett said students’ true strength was shown in their ability to stand together in opposition to misogyny and disrespect.
“What we’ve seen on this campus over the past few days has been how we deal with this tension,” Garrett said. “We combat the objectionable, the vile and the repulsive speech through our community by speaking out. We delegitimize it, we ensure the safety of our comrades and we fight ignorance and intolerance with reason, solidarity and a stronger community — a community that is led by strong women and men who respect strong women.”
Garrett expressed her pride in the work of the Take Back the Night project, including the hundreds of shirts painted with messages speaking out against sexual violence.
“I’ve looked all week at the clothesline project, and as I’ve looked out at that I’m so proud of the power that it represents, of the emotions that they represent, of the experience and the history that they represent,” Garrett said.
Lauren Dawson, associate director of Take Back the Night, said seven T-shirts have been taken from the clothesline project in Alumni Park.
Dawson said one T-shirt has been returned, but she doesn’t know who took that shirt or the others.  A report has been filed with the Dept. of Public Safety.
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson also spoke at the rally, echoing Garrett’s sentiment that throughout the recent controversies at USC, students have displayed a remarkable sense of community in standing up against what they see as degrading and harmful conduct.
“I’m really proud that we have come together to speak out against hatred, that we have men and women who are like-minded and like-spirited, that we have men who are willing to stand up and encourage their brothers to look within their own hearts and take that affirmative step when they see somebody being abused,” Jackson said.
Jackson also stressed students should not feel they have to take action alone. He said in addition to all of the hard work being put in by students, staff and faculty members are also willing to stand by them in solidarity.
“I’ve dedicated my entire career to helping students be successful and trying to create environments where men and women can have healthy relationships,” Jackson said. “We are all together in fighting sexual violence, misogyny and victimization of people in our communities.”
Most students in attendance felt the rally was effective in drawing attention to issues of sexual violence  on a college campus.
“It was very moving because even if not many people think about it, these are issues that need attention,” said Salma Nigar, a graduate student studying electrical engineering. “Rallies like this are absolutely important in drawing that attention.”
Rachel Smith, a senior majoring in cinema critical studies, agreed such rallies are essential in educating people about issues they might not be paying attention to, such as sexual violence on college campuses.
“It’s very eye-opening,” Smith said. “A lot of people aren’t really aware of how much of a problem this might be. Everyone rallying together encourages more people to not only pay attention but also take action.”
Frat boy: You’re talking about Mike Garret. This is Elizabeth Garret.
He or she should be gone over that whole Bush stuff
I thought we got rid of Garrett when Carrol left?
they weren’t “surprise speakers”. They were specifically invited and welcomed to come speak. Side note: is the DT EVER going to manage to print an actual picture of Take Back the Night? last year they printed a photo of MenCare and called it a day, no article included. So I suppose an article is finally a step up…but seriously…the least you could do is get a photo of the crowd or the key performer or even the women who were responsible for organizing and planning and facilitating the entire event (Lauren Dawson and Jade Fields)…better luck next year, maybe?
