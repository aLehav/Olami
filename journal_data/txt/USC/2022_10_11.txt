Vegan food often gets a bad rap. Still, whether you’re already a fan of vegan food or have never even tried it, the hot vegan restaurants showcased at Vegan Street Fair Nights 2022 this past weekend are definitely worth a shot. These innovative chefs have explored cuisines around the world, ranging from Mexico to Japan, and are ready for Los Angeles locals to taste their creations. While not all of these restaurants are based in L.A., they all traveled to North Hollywood to share their dishes at the event, a fair with over 50 plant-based vendors, DJs and entertainment.

Malinda Lo’s newest novel, “A Scatter of Light,” is the queer coming-of-age story that we all need to hear.
Although the novel serves as a companion to the wildly popular “Last Night at the Telegraph Club,” Lo’s newest novel stands on its own and tells a new and exciting story. The story revolves around Aria Tang West, an 18-year-old girl sent to live with her grandmother during the summer of 2013, when same-sex marraige was legalized in California.
At the beginning of the summer, Aria meets Steph Nichols, her grandmother’s gardener. Aria is immediately drawn to Steph and is quickly embraced into Steph’s friend group. For the first time, Aria is surrounded by out queer people and finds herself eager to learn about the LGBTQ+ community. Between Steph, her girlfriend Lisa and her friend Mel, Aria is immersed into a world full of pride parades, unashamed queerness and community.
Soon after meeting Steph and making queer friends, Aria begins to understand her own sexuality. One of the biggest things that this book does right is that it does not make coming out an event. Aria’s realization takes time, but it is not a source of sadness or self-hatred for her. No one makes her sexuality a big deal; even her own family seems to know without her having to tell them. There is certainly merit to stories about coming out, as it can be an incredibly difficult process, but it doesn’t always have to be. 
Aria’s sexuality, though important, is not the only focus of the novel. The relationship between Aria and her grandmother, Joan West, is a crucial piece of the story. Joan, an artist and photographer, is Aria’s confidant and biggest supporter. Even without knowing all the details of Aria’s life, Joan manages to encourage her granddaughter to believe in her own abilities and to do what makes her happy.
Another interesting aspect of “A Scatter of Light” is Aria’s relationship with her divorced parents. Her father, an author, is one of the most important people in Aria’s life. Yet, her relationship with her mother is much more tumultuous. An opera singer who is rarely there for her daughter, Aria’s mother is uninvolved and often puts herself first. However, both parents ultimately love and support their daughter. The dynamic that Aria has with her parents affects the decisions that she makes and is certainly relatable to many of Lo’s readers.
Aria is interested in Steph throughout the novel, but “A Scatter of Light” focuses much more on her personal journey than on her romantic interest. Rather, her crush on Steph is used as a way for Aria to begin to understand her bisexuality and to move the plot forward. It is always fun to read a cute romance novel, but it is refreshing to hear a queer story that is a bit more realistic. 
Although Aria and Steph are clearly drawn to one another, it can be a bit difficult to see the chemistry between them. Steph’s interests are defined, but she does not have many character traits that stand out, making her severely underdeveloped as a character. Aria’s journey may be the central focus of the plot, but it remains important that her love interest be someone who is interesting and liked by the reader. Flawed characters are great, but in order to work, they require traits that supersede their weaknesses.
While it is categorized as a young adult novel, “A Scatter of Light” is not limited to a teenage audience. Many books of this genre can fall into the trap of having a simplified plot or boring writing, but Lo manages to avoid this problem. Instead, she has written a story that can not only be read by teenagers and adults alike, but can be related to by both audiences.
Queer media’s mainstream presence has risen exponentially in recent years, but sapphic literature in particular remains hard to find. Aria is a bisexual woman, but the novel also highlights many lesbian characters. The history and stigma surrounding the word “lesbian” is long and complicated, and in many artworks, saying the word is often avoided or treated as dirty. However, one critical part of “A Scatter of Light” is that the word “lesbian” is never avoided or stigmatized. Instead, being queer is celebrated in all forms.
The strong moments of this book far outweighed any of the negatives, cementing it as a four-star read. While “A Scatter of Light” is a book about the queer community, it is a must-read for everyone.

Before NCT 127 even graced the stage, the Crypto.com Arena already resounded with the thunderous screams of thousands of NCTzens, the group’s dedicated fans, Thursday night. The fans’ Neobongs, the group’s lightstick, illuminated the venue: peering down from the balcony, the floor appeared to be littered with a sea of green stars moving in sync with the beat. The atmosphere of anticipation and excitement was palpable as the group’s tracks blaring over the speakers only grew louder leading up to the concert’s kick-off. 
As the last pre-recorded song ended, the arena plunged into darkness queuing the crowd’s deafening roar. Every light snapped toward the stage as the group’s nine members emerged dressed in sharp, solid white outfits, the fans only screaming louder as each of them made their way to the center of the stage, forming a line to revel in the elation of their NCTzens. After three years, NCT 127 was finally back in the United States and ready to begin the night with a bang.
The opening segment of the concert began with the group’s experimental smash hit “Kick It,”, as the crowd went berserk upon hearing the song’s opening lyrics, “Let me introduce you to some new things!” Pyrotechnics lining the stage only hyped up the crowd more, further enhancing the group’s performance. 
The group immediately transitioned into “Lemonade” and “Cherry Bomb,” two hardcore hip-hop tracks specifically highlighting the group’s rap ability, passing the spotlight to members Mark, Taeyong and Jaehyun as they loudly proclaimed, “I’m the biggest hit on the stage.” The choreography for these two songs was nothing to scoff at either, as the group flawlessly performed strong and compacted movements while staying perfectly in sync with each other. 
Having finished their opening stages, the members began their initial greetings to the crowd. As members introduced themselves one by one, fans cheered for each member respectively. Spirits were high as member Johnny explained the meaning behind the tour name, “The Link,’’ yelling that on that day, NCT 127 and NCTzens would “form a link.” 
And form a link they certainly did. Though the concert attendance was massive with around 12,000 NCTzens filling the Crypto.com Arena, the emotional bond between NCT 127 and their NCTzens was incredibly intimate. Each of the members, but especially Taeyong and Mark, reiterated how much they had missed their American fans on multiple occasions throughout the night. 
Due to the impact of the coronavirus, NCT 127 had been unable to perform in the United States for a few years, making this particular concert dear to both the group and their fans. The time elapsed between the last time they had performed here and now was quite significant — significant enough that the group had released three new full-length albums since their last visit, making this concert the U.S. debut of many songs performed at the show.
Transitioning seamlessly into an upbeat, pop-based segment, NCT 127 performed their songs “Elevator,” “Dreamer” and “Love Song.” Each of the members vibed across the stage, blithely dancing with each other and interacting with stage props as members Haechan, Taeil and Doyoung gave the audience a taste of their live vocal ability, casually belting out their lines with incredible ease. The lighthearted atmosphere conjured by the segment encouraged many fans to dance in place and unabashedly sing along with the idols. 
The middle portion of the show was riddled with solos and duets such as “Love Sign,” Haechan and Taeil’s ballad duet in which the two took turns showing off their impressive vocal chops, captivating the audience with their magnificent harmonies. Mark’s solo, “Vibration,” and his duet with Taeyong, “The Himalayas,” displayed the pair’s rap abilities, hyping up NCTzens with their electrifying performances. Jungwoo graced the dimmed stage donning a solid black cowboy outfit and a bejeweled cowboy hat to dance to a remixed version of the group’s Japanese song “Lipstick,” while Yuta enthralled the fans with an enchanting performance of his solo, “Butterfly.” 
However, the solo many would argue to be the most memorable of the night was Johnny’s show-stopping, shirtless solo, “Focus,” in which he performed a racy number within a clear, glass room. 
Coming together as a full group, the nine members strutted down the extended stage to the center of the crowd, interacting with fans through waves, finger hearts and peace signs. On the middle stage, NCT performed their iconic song, “Regular (English Version).” As Mark would later mention, the addition of “Regular (English Version)” to the setlist was a last-minute decision made when the members recalled just how much American fans adored the song. This adoration definitely showed through as NCTzens aggressively waved their Neobongs and screamed the lyrics as loudly as they possibly could.
The finale of the show contained three of the group’s most recent songs: “Sticker,” “Faster” and “2 Baddies.” At this point, no fan was in their seat, and if they were, they were sorely missing out. The energy had reached a breaking point, climaxing as the arena was overwhelmed with cheers, pyrotechnics, lasers and confetti. With the encore came a bittersweet aura from the members as they pranced around the stage, dancing for audience members, taking phones and blowing kisses. 
As NCT 127 finished up their last songs, “Dreams Come True” and “Promise You,” the members shouted their final emotional goodbyes to their NCTzens. It was truly an endearing scene to witness: fans shouted and cried as NCT 127 made their way back up the stage and stood behind the closing screen, drawing the show to a close.
Though K-pop may not be for everyone, the energy at K-pop concerts is absolutely unmatched, and NCT 127’s concert “Neo City – The Link” was certainly no exception. NCTzens will undoubtedly eagerly anticipate the group’s return to the States.

A new master’s program in addiction science will be offered starting Fall 2023 in a joint venture between the Keck School of Medicine, the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the School of Pharmacy. 
The degree will be offered by the USC Institute of Addiction Science, which was founded in 2018 to promote research and education in addiction science across scientific disciplines. 
“[The program is] really the first of its kind in the country that approaches addiction from a transdisciplinary educational standpoint,” said Jennifer Lewis, the IAS training consortium co-leader.
Beyond the master’s program, IAS Associate Educational Program Director Terry Church said the institute hopes to grow its educational programs to create certificate and Ph.D. programs in addition to the undergraduate minor in addiction sciences IAS already offers. Currently, the master’s program does not have a progressive degree option. USC also offers the Rising STARS program, which provides career development opportunities in addiction science for undergraduates. 
The master’s program is 32 units in total and includes a few core classes that touch on foundational material in addiction science and also offers students research and clinical experience. At the end of the program, students will write a master’s thesis relating to pharmacy, medicine and social work. 
IAS Ph.D Director Adam Leventhal said the interdisciplinary nature of the degree allows students to study addiction from many different perspectives. 
“We’re looking at addiction from a very broad lens, from biology to psychology to society, to even economics and policy,” Leventhal said. 
Many of the courses students can take will be electives, allowing them to choose the dimension of addiction they want to focus their studies on. 
As the program is a collaboration among the Schools of Medicine, Social Work and Pharmacy, students can take courses in any of these schools to count toward their degree. They can also choose to have either a clinical or research concentration. 
“You can take [the courses] in the pain clinic … you can take them in pharmacy, you can take them in social work, in nursing, and obviously in medicine, so it actually spans a lot of different kinds of courses that allows you to do a little customization for your master’s degree,” Lewis said.
One such course is called Buzz, which centers on modern substance abuse and addiction, offered through the School of Pharmacy.
Lewis said she expects graduates to use the skills gained from the program to work in a variety of fields, such as therapists, counselors, researchers, rehabilitation center supervisors or directors and public policy advocates related to addiction. 
Church said he hopes the program will help destigmatize addiction and emphasized that the program is open to all students. 
“If you have ever known anyone who’s been touched by addiction in any way — and most people know at least one person — then our classes might be of interest to you,” Church said. “They will give you ways to understand not only what the person is going through but [also] how best to help them.” 
IAS is looking to expand beyond USC into the larger South Los Angeles community, possibly including a program for high schoolers, as Church said. 
The expected length of the program is two years and applications are currently open for Fall 2023 enrollment.

As soothing music plays in the background, Shreya Ranganathan, a senior majoring in journalism, welcomes attendees to her weekly yoga class by handing them a notecard and marker. Yogis of all experience levels sit on laid-out mats as they write down gratitudes or complaints and use the time to calm the mind.
Ranganathan’s “Holistic Hatha” yoga class, a space to reflect and let go of quotidienne worries, provides attendees a mental break during one of the busiest times of the semester: midterm season. 
Breathing techniques, such as Bhastrika and Ujjayi breathing, typically follow the warm-up writing exercise. Ixtli-Ann Cordero-Guerra, a freshman majoring in international relations and  intelligence and cyber operations, said the attendees do “breath work to relax us and get the tension out of our body.” The session ends with a meditation, sitting into asana or laying down and melting, figuratively, into the mat.
Although Ranganathan had practiced yoga for years, she said the catalyst for her truly appreciating the practice was in 2019, when she traveled to India for the first time. 
“What really stuck out was that I saw so much beauty in ancient knowledge that was embedded into the practice [of yoga],” Ranganathan said. “By getting in touch with my identity in my culture through the practice of yoga, I felt that [healing] and I never wanted to let go of that feeling.”
When she returned to the United States, Ranganathan began to research yoga, quickly finding that she didn’t see herself represented in the stream of white creators practicing yoga on YouTube. 
“I found out just how important it is to have representation in these spaces,” she said. “I saw so much history being kind of swept under the rug and I wanted to change that.” 
This commitment to inspiring change led her to Bangalore, India in the summer of 2021, where she became certified to teach yoga. 
Ranganathan, the director of yoga engagement for Yoga USC, hosts the class every Wednesday at the Physical Education building from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. The class has grown in size; it began as a class of 10 to 15 students on Zoom in 2021 and has recently moved to the basement of the PHED building to accommodate its increased popularity.
Ranganathan invites students, staff and faculty to “take one hour of our day to come into a safe space, leave our judgments, leave our prior and post commitments outside of the door and just channel introspectively. [Consider] what our emotions are and where we can kind of find the state of present being,” she said. “We can get to true healing and it’s been so spectacular to watch people feel that way.”
Riya Shah, a junior majoring in global health, started doing Zoom yoga classes during the coronavirus pandemic. “Holistic Hatha” was her first in-person yoga class and she makes sure to find the time to attend the yoga classes each week, even with the academic pressures and demands of college life. 
“Everyone seems really nice,” Shah said about the classroom environment. “Even if I do something wrong, I never feel like someone is judging me. Everybody is in their own zone. It is a judgment free zone.”
Ranganathan considers herself “a traveling yoga teacher” because the class continues to move from location to location as the class increases in size. No matter the location, though, her goal for the class has remained the same.
“The goal of  is to allow you to think introspectively, to look beyond the confines of the space that you’re in, and take these lessons and values with you beyond the mat and apply them to your own life, because that’s truly what yoga is meant to be,” Ranganathan said.
When reflecting upon her role within the practice yoga, Ranganathan said she sees herself as a storyteller.
“Yoga is really storytelling with the heart, the head, the mind, the spirit, the breath. It’s a holistic way of telling stories for an hour,” Ranganathan said. “It was cool to explore that; not only are you experiencing it, but you have to be able to convey that to people and have it touch their hearts and touch their souls.”

In 1928, economist John Maynard Keynes famously proclaimed that a century on, technological efficiency and economic prosperity would blossom so much that work would become obsolete and people would be bored from having too much leisure time. He further stated that people could retain three hours of work per day just to feel useful.
Yet, here we are, only a few years away from 2028, annd only parts of Keynes’ prediction came true — technological innovations did largely increase our productivity and replace a lot of manual and physical labor. Economically, we are in the most prosperous time in human history. However, instead of the banishment of drudgery for expansive leisure and limitless personal freedom, Americans are working more than ever. 
Wall Street Journal writer Robert Frank explained, “For many of today’s rich there is no such thing as ‘leisure’ in the classic sense — work is their play. They don’t sit around the polo field or lounge around the country club all day like Old Money. The new rich are perpetual-motion machines — young, driven and always working on the next project.” 
This newfound sentiment on the relationship between money and leisure is reflected in many undergrads at elite universities today. We fall prey to this workaholic mentality with a pathological desire to be constantly productive. 
Instead of using technological progress to free ourselves from work, we transitioned from a product-based economy to a service-based one — a category of the economy that includes finance, technology and entertainment. The entire services industry accounts for over two-thirds of the United States’ gross domestic product, creating many spiritually unfulfilling and actually meaningless jobs in the meantime — a phenomenon coined by anthropologist David Graeber as the phenomenon of “bullshit jobs.” 
But how is this all tied to us? This is where the phenomenon of “career funneling” for elite undergrads comes in. According to a 2016 study by sociologist Amy Binder, more than half of the graduates of America’s most selective colleges head into an extremely concentrated band of professions — mainly, the finance and consulting sectors, as well as high-tech firms.   
Many jobs in these sectors are what Graeber would call the “goons,” or people who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employers. Take the tech industry for example; advertising is the main source of revenue for many top tech firms. In the case of Meta, it contributes to 98% of its revenue.  
Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist at The World Bank, argues that the major tech firms obtain competitive advantages over who can best exploit their consumers. Stiglitz says that a question all tech firms face internally is, “Which is the easier way to make a buck: figuring out a better way to exploit somebody, or making a better product?,” and most choose the former.
Companies like Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Amazon care about their young recruits’ qualifications, but they care even more about their willingness to work 17 hours a day or to dedicate 120 hours to work every week. They treat workers as commodities: disposable and replaceable. 
However, the students themselves are not to blame for their career choices. The real culprit is the elaborate, structured recruitment system for particular job pathways that exists on many private, elite campuses. Binder argues, “Students come to campus, they’re very ambitious, they want to have great careers, but they’re incredibly naïve about what the labor force actually looks like.” What occurs due to this job illiteracy is a vulnerability to accept whatever job is most convenient and will let them survive in this capitalistic world.
Indeed, at the fall career fair held by the USC Career Center a few weeks ago where the University charged recruiters to come to campus — various finance, consulting and high-tech firms filled Trousdale Parkway, with lines of undergrads dressed in suits and pencil skirts despite the heat, eagerly waiting behind their booths. 
While there are other firms such as non-governmental organizations at the career fair, let’s all admit it — that was not the appeal of the career fair. The postgrad outcomes offer clear evidence of this. According to the USC Career Center, among the 30 top employers for USC graduates, 12 are in finance and consulting, including all four of the “Big Four” in consulting, all five of “FAANG” — the acronym for the five most prominent tech companies — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google and most of the major investment banks. 
How are college students expected to avoid the siren song of these recruiters, when universities are actively, massively facilitating the pipeline from graduation to the most powerful and most wealthy sectors? 
Institutions of higher education pride themselves on their commitment to teaching their undergraduates to do good, to develop a love for thinking, to undergo an intellectual transformatio and to transform society into a better place. USC claims its central mission is “the development of human beings and society as a whole through the cultivation and enrichment of the human mind and spirit.” Yet, they partner up with Wall Street and high-tech firms to channel the young, bright, ambitious and motivated students into these sectors, which, uncoincidentally, is where their trustees, donors and wealthy alumni are from.  
To the universities: you are failing in your duty of care and revealing your hypocrisy. 
To my fellow students: Money may buy you some certainty and some prestige, but it does not buy your self-direction, personal autonomy, sense of social utility or individual fulfillment. Pursue your passion, no matter how uncertain the path seems. We said this a lot back in 2011, but it still holds true — you only live once, so don’t let these soul-sucking employers trap you into these bullshit jobs.

Over the summer, I went to the inaugural Palomino Festival at Brookside near the Rose Bowl, and I brought nothing but my best boots, my good fringe western shirt and the chunkiest sunglasses I had. I left with more credit card debt, loads of merch and slightly frazzled, because I ran into Noah Centineo, but I didn’t think it was really him, because I thought the guy I saw was way too short to be Noah Centineo. Turns out, it really was him. 
I also left feeling giddy. Giddy because Palomino was originally just a stage where new talent would perform at Stagecoach. I was also giddy because, for the price of the ticket, the lineup was completely wicked, including the likes of Orville Peck, Charley Crockett, Kacey Musgraves, Jason Isbell and Sierra Ferrell. It marks a country music revival, in a good way. After what has felt like years of pop-country that’s more or less the mainstay in country music now, there’s new blood in the genre. Their backgrounds, their unique sounds and their lyrics recall old country and western, and yet they’ve been able to mold the genre to encompass the issues and realities of today.
One new blood making waves is Tyler Childers. Prior to the release of his part-gospel, part-funky album, “Can I Take My Hounds to Heaven,” Childers wore a Charles Booker for U.S. Senate shirt to one of his shows in Kentucky. Booker is a Democrat running to unseat Rand Paul in the Senate. The reaction was instantaneous, but this wasn’t Childer’s first run-in with a country music establishment or fan base that’s taken the “shut up and sing” stance so ardently. In fact, those bold enough to break out of the apolitical box that’s been silently put up around them have always gotten slack for it. 
Political moves in country music aren’t new by any means. Before Willie Nelson was stumping for Beto O’Rourke in Texas, he smoked pot on the roof of the White House with Jimmy Carter’s son, supported slews of liberal politicians and bucked LGBTQIA discrimination.  Fans always threatened to boycott his shows for his beliefs, and yet he’s still headlining shows and, all things considered, is an outlaw still considered an in-law in the country music establishment. And even before Willie, there were folks with fairly progressive songs like Loretta Lynn. 
The day after I pitched this piece, Lynn died. A morbid coincidence, for sure, but when the queen of old country music passes, it makes you have a bit of a come-to-Jesus moment. There are probably a ton of you out there who have never heard of Loretta Lynn, which is fair. To country music, Loretta’s death was like losing an older version of Dolly Parton. But beyond her physical self, when Loretta passed, I think country music lost a bit of its soul. With her went a lot of the fightin’ side of the genre, the side that was unapologetic, and for lack of a better word, progressive. 
When Lynn released “The Pill” in 1975, a song about a new reality with birth control, the backlash from the conservative country music industry was instantaneous. It was banned on many radio stations, and to this day, “The Pill” is seldom played on the airwaves. And while Loretta Lynn is by no means a bleeding heart Democrat (quite the opposite, she was a Trump supporter), “The Pill” and other anthems like it were objectively ahead of their time. “The Pill” in particular was reportedly more impactful in informing low-income women about birth control than healthcare literature. Politically bold messages riddled country music back then, and it was hardly like any of the songs on the country music radio nowadays: none of that fake twang, chicken-fried horseshit (I’m looking at you, Zac Brown). 
We’re lucky to get front-row tickets to country music returning to its roots. The country and western genre started out as an amalgamation of influences from those living in the Southeast, including enslaved Black people and European immigrants, singing high tales of the trials and tribulations of the working class, or somber retellings of heartbreak and broken families. In many ways, the songs of current, progressive country artists reflect the sound and the messages of the roots of country music more so than the country songs on repeat on the radio, and I, for one, am here for it.

Many schools and athletic programs have decided to part ways with their coaches, even though it is not even halfway through the college football season. Some notable schools include University of Nebraska (Scott Frost), Georgia Institute of Technology (Geoff Collins), University of Colorado (Karl Dorrell), Arizona State University (Herm Edwards) and most surprisingly University of Wisconsin (Paul Chryst). 
It’s understandable why these schools made these decisions, as USC took a similar path last year, firing Clay Helton in September 2021. This gave USC more time to find the next coach for their future and hold on to any recruits for the following season. With this season’s lineup of firings, all of these schools are going to be taking a careful look at who the best person is to lead their respective football programs moving forward. This is especially true with some strong college football head coaches on the market now, like Matt Rhule (who just got fired from the Carolina Panthers on Monday.) 
However, how do schools afford to make such decisions, especially because these coaching contracts typically exceed millions of dollars? For instance, when Frost got fired from Nebraska after losing to Georgia Southern 42-45 (led by Clay Helton, ironically), the school had to buy out his large contract. By firing him this September, they had to pay $15 million, rather than $7.5 million if they waited until October. 
Even though we know schools’ athletic budgets are extremely high, these amounts are not minuscule at all for any program. Typically when it comes to these urgent changes, the schools can convince their boosters to fund part or all of the bill. Essentially, boosters are individuals and/or groups who fundraise and donate money to the schools for their athletics programs. Another important aspect of boosters is that they can act fast because they can typically give money whenever they want, making it optimal for these large buyouts. 
However, these boosters have made contract negotiations between coaches and schools much tougher, especially when it comes to buyouts. Since coaches know that the schools can get the money whenever they want to fire them through boosters, buyout levels are greatly increasing. 
Mel Tucker, the head coach of the Michigan State Spartans, took the team to an impressive 11-2 record last season, winning the Peach Bowl; however, their season has been underperforming this season with a 2-4 record and zero wins in conference play. There is a low chance that the school will fire Tucker, because they signed him a $95 million fully guaranteed deal last season and will have to pay that remaining amount for his buyout.
Similarly, Jimbo Fisher, the head coach of Texas A&M, recently had one of the strongest recruiting classes of 2022. Now, he is also not performing as strongly as well, losing games to teams such as Appalachian State at home and having a 3-3 record; yet once again, Fisher’s job is going to stay intact for many years barring any severe issues. This is because they would have to pay almost $86 million if they fire him this year, and this amount goes down to only $39.2 million if they wait until 2027. Both are extremely high dollar amounts and will take a lot of funding to finance. 
Overall, when thinking about these coaching buyouts, they do seem costly, but they can also help the team position itself for success in the future, as witnessed by USC with the eventual hiring of Head Coach Lincoln Riley. On the other hand, since coaches know that boosters will fund these buyouts, they will negotiate higher-paying contracts to make it more difficult for them to get fired, putting us at a standstill.

Coming off of a 0-1 loss to Arizona, the Trojans looked to reestablish their command of PAC-12 conference play at their game against Arizona State Sunday, in which they emerged victorious 2-1. 
“After a big upset on Thursday… we had to come off this game strong with energy, just step the level up and come with intensity,” senior midfielder Croix Bethune said.
With the guidance of Assistant Coach Shigeyoshi “Sugar” Shinohara — former assistant at Arizona State — and Head Coach Jane Alukonis, USC struck early in the 11th minute. Off of a quick restart, sophomore midfielder Helena Sampaio assisted Bethune on a shot just outside the right post and into an open goal.  
“Sugar obviously had the experience of working with them before, so he gave the very best scout he could in terms of game plan… I was proud that we came out and scored early,” Alukonis said.
After a quick change of possession, sophomore forward Kayla Colbert carried the team downfield along the left bank. With her elegant and elusive ball movement, Colbert perfectly set up Bethune to score her second goal of the game, and seventh of the season. 
In response to the early deficit, Arizona State turned up the pressure on both ends of the field. Although they were scoreless in the first half, the Sun Devils gained momentum as they closed out the 45th minute, outshooting the Trojans 8 shots to 4 shots.
In the 48th minute, Arizona State capitalized on a scoring opportunity when freshman defender Meighan Farrell assisted a goal by freshman midfielder Enasia Colon. 
The Trojan defense held the ASU attack scoreless throughout the remainder of the match. 
“I’m glad we finished the job. We had some really strong defensive efforts that stopped some of their good opportunities,” Alukonis said. 
Alukonis believes that the key to USC’s defensive performance was “doing the job, grit and staying in tune the whole time.” 
“[Defender] Brandi Peterson had some really big stops and [Defender] Kaylin [Martin] had her hands full. [The] center backs had their hands full the whole game with [Forward] Nicole Douglas — she’s [a] top goal scorer in the country,” Alukonis said.
In the pregame Senior Day ceremony, the Trojans honored Bethune and Martin alongside senior forwards Jaelyn Eisenhart and Olufolasade Adamolekun, defenders Lily Babalola, Savannah Kessler and Nicole Payne, and forward Hannah White.
These seniors exhibited their leadership, experience and resilience this Sunday in the bounce-back victory. To commemorate one of their final home games, Bethune, Payne and Martin took charge of their ends of the field and each played a full 90 minutes.
On the defensive front, Martin and Payne restricted the impact of the Sun Devils’ 21 shots while also revealing their ability to make explosive plays down the field and facilitate shots on goal for the Trojan offense.
White rectified her offensive presence as she took her first shots on goal for the first time in three games, and Bethune’s brace revealed her continued evolution as an energizing leader and a scoring powerhouse when the ball is within her reach.
With this Senior Day win, the Trojans have regained their strength and cohesion at both ends of the field. 
“We worked harder… The full game has to be full effort or full focus every single time we play…. We knew that today we had to come out and give something different,” said Alukonis. 
The seniors will continue to lead their team as they enter the final six regular season matches of the season.
USC improves to 8-2-1 overall and 4-1-0 in Pac-12 play. The team will travel north this week to take on UC Berkeley  Friday at 4:00 p.m.
