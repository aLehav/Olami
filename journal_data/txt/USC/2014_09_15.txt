The USC Department of Political Science held its first “Political Conversations” event on Monday in the Von KleinSmid Center, hosted by Professor Robert Shrum with political consultant Alex Castellanos leading the discussion.

Launched this year, “Political Conversations” is a series that brings together leading analysts of American politics to discuss the country’s current political landscape. The theme of Monday’s inaugural event was “The Future of the GOP: Should/Can the Party Reinvent Itself?” and focused heavily on building a new generation within the Republican Party.
“Our problems [in the GOP] are pandemic — they are not just with any one group,” Castellanos said. “We’re losing [the youth], we’re losing the future, and that’s the one thing we can’t do. No product can survive this.”
Castellanos, who Shrum described as a “serious horse in GOP politics since the early 1980s,” has worked on various Republican political campaigns over his tenure, including George W. Bush’s 2000 and 2004 races and Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential run. He declined to work with Romney in 2012.
In an hour-long presentation, Castellanos described the current Republican Party as one too focused on the word “no” — an argument that he believes is destined to fail among young voters.
Rather, his revised GOP mindset, what he calls being a “New Republican,” runs under a slogan, “Freedom Nationally, Values Locally.” Its ideals focus on bottom-up economic policy, that grows “naturally and organically,” an open healthcare system, a bottom-up immigration system that “lets states decide what kind of bright minds and hard workers they need,” and an emphasis on individuals rather than big business and government.
Castellanos stressed that if Republicans continue on their current track, both their chances of success in the next election cycle as well as their overall sustainability as a party is in danger.
“[Against the Democrats] it’s [now] a debate between the ‘promise of more’ and the ‘certainty of no’ — we don’t have much of a shot,” he said.
The veteran political consultant often employed a self-effacing strategy throughout the presentation, speaking candidly on the failures of the Republican Party in accessing a youthful demographic.
“We are so uncool and out-of date, that culturally we’re not acceptable to a new generation of others,” he said.
With this, he was able to contrast current GOP strategy with that of a New Republican. He noted the new strategy must be to show voters that the current Democratic government is old and outdated — one that is too focused on top-down, inflexible strategy from Washington that doesn’t play to the individual.
Shrum, who has worked as a political consultant on the presidential campaigns of Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, was hesitant about many of Castellanos’ points. In particular, he questioned the Republican Party’s ability to successfully shift their stance on social issues and immigration by 2016. Castellanos conceded that marriage equality would, more than likely, not be accepted by Republicans by that time.
“Our fruit is not ripe in the Republican Party — our next generation is not ready yet,” Castellanos said. “It’s possible that the Republicans are still a cycle away.”
Nevertheless, Castellanos stressed that a well-run campaign is a defining factor in whether a candidate is elected or not, and thus a GOP victory is still possible. In an interview with the Daily Trojan after the event, Castellanos discussed how the New Republicans plan to convince young, Democratic voters to shift to the GOP.
“Republicans should do what Barack Obama promised and didn’t do — he said ‘we are the change we have been waiting for,’ but he didn’t mean that,” Castellanos said. “He meant more Washington is the change we have been waiting for. People don’t have more power, people don’t have more openness or choices — Washington has more money, power and choices. That won’t work.”
He explained that, more than anything else, young voters need a viable candidate come 2016.
“Our generation has f-cked your generation — you’re coming out of school, jobs are harder to find, you have a ton of student debt … Something’s got to change,” Castellanos said. “But it won’t unless we give you guys a better alternative than the one you have now.”

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism is offering a new set of classes this fall designed to engage students in interdisciplinary media studies.
The series, called Annenberg Experimental or Annenberg X, hopes to blend concepts from the fields of media, journalism, communication and entertainment. Courses range from Professor Jonathan Aronson’s class Going Viral to Professor K.C. Cole’s and adjunct professor Roberta Marinelli’s experiential class Environmental Communications, which includes a weekend field trip to Catalina Island.
Each class is 2 units and spans approximately six weeks, packing a large amount of material into three-and-a-half hour sessions once a week. Associate Professor Gordon Stables emphasized the hands-on experience offered in the classes.
“We’re looking for nontraditional ways to get students exposure to the world of media,” Stables said. “It’s designed to be an accent, to help students explore the university.”
According to Stables, the inspiration for the classes came from Annenberg’s Dean Ernest J. Wilson III.
“Dean Wilson really wanted to break down the silos between the different parts of the discipline,” Stables said.
Each professor has the freedom to design his or her class, allowing them to explore subjects that can’t be taught in a traditional 16-week semester, according to Aronson, the director of the initiative.
“We thought, ‘We have all this new technology, all these interesting people floating around, what is a better way to get people training that is useful in the real world?’” he said.
Though the popularity of online content can sometimes be arbitrary, learning to harness the power of popular approval is applicable in a variety of disciplines, according to Aronson. He also sees the skills addressed in the Going Viral class as part of a much bigger picture.
“We tend to see communication as a critical part as how to go about thinking,” he said. “Effective communication teaches you to build on your creativity.”
Aronson also oversees the most popular course, Leadership in Startup Digital Media Ventures. The class is taught by entrepreneurial expert Dinesh Moorjani, a Harvard Business School graduate and current executive-in-residence at Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm. The class is set up to be informational yet interactive as students learn the necessities of entrepreneurship, from basic accounting to wider marketing strategies, by examining and discussing different current companies.
Moorjani, who has never taught a class before, said he is excited to help students cultivate their imaginations in different ways.
“I want students to leave with that practical toolkit, to have stretched their quantitative abilities and imagination,” Moorjani said. “Hopefully, throughout the class, their neurons have been firing and new synapses are forming, preparing them to deal with new situations in a logical way.”
Andrew Poksay, a senior majoring in industrial and systems engineering said the class is invaluable to him as he prepares to launch his own business, an online marketplace for the exchange of surf gear.
“I really appreciate being able to bounce ideas off [Moorjani],” he said.
Moorjani recommends Annenberg X to students who want to increase their capabilities beyond journalism and media studies. Annenberg administrators have said they want to offer students both interdisciplinary and practical education, an initiative they call the Annenberg Advantage.
Stables said that most universities do not house the disciplines of communication, journalism and public relations in the same school.
“Most communication schools don’t have an entrepreneurship focus,” he said. “But for us, being in Los Angeles, it’s a necessary part of what we want our students to learn.”
Stables describes the Annenberg Advantage as the school’s way of preparing students for professional careers by providing services such as practical career counseling.
“We’re really interested in shortening the transition from school to your professional work experience,” Stables said.
Caitlin Plummer, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, agreed. She said the program opens up more options for students upon graduation and show that the school is keeping up with the times.
“Not every student in Annenberg wants to be a reporter or a publicist, and the classes in Annenberg X acknowledge that,” she said. “I think offering courses on real-world skills specific to certain areas of communication is smart; it’s providing necessary information that students didn’t need ten years ago.”
Moorjani sees the classes as having a wider reach into students’ effect on society.
“I hope this will help them learn to create value in society, rather than extracting value from society,” he said.

USC President C. L. Max Nikias was joined by several Los Angeles elected officials on Monday for the groundbreaking of the new Village at USC, one of the largest economic development projects in South Los Angeles history.
It takes a village · USC President C.L. Max Nikias was joined by Los Angeles elected officials and Undergraduate Student Government President Andrew Menard for the groundbreaking ceremony of The Village. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Set to open in the fall of 2017, the project will prominently feature residential, retail and recreational facilities. With over 1.25 million square feet of space, the $650 million Village will be designed to resemble a medieval Tuscan plaza. The project will be built around the idea of a European town square that will include a central promenade with coffee shops, restaurants and residential colleges.
“This is a historic day for the university but also for the city of Los Angeles,” Nikias said in his opening remarks.
Nikias expressed his gratitude to several civic leaders who aided in the approval process, particularly former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Villaraigosa said The Village project would benefit not only USC, but also the surrounding community.
“This is a project that will enhance student housing in a way that will create a more vibrant student community, but also invest in affordable housing and economic development, so it’s a win-win,” Villaraigosa told the Daily Trojan after the event.
Two years ago, when the project was initially announced, the surrounding community expressed mixed feelings about the project. The main concern was the loss of revenue and employment for the businesses formerly located in the University Village, as well as the gentrification of the area surrounding the project. Student government representatives addressed this concern at the event.
“The USC Village is going to welcome not only USC students and faculty, but also the University Park community as a whole,” said Undergraduate Student Government President Andrew Menard. “During the planning process, including the surrounding community [in] the USC Village was always a goal of the project.”
Graduate Student Government President Yohey Tokumitsu responded to the concern over removing the former University Village businesses.
“We were afraid to displace the former UV businesses during the transitional period, [but] the university provided free real estate services for the former tenants as well as provided some with thousands of dollars for help with the relocation,” he said.
According to Tokumitsu, there is currently very limited housing space for graduate students both on and around campus. He said the new Village would open up new housing for graduate students and their families.
Mark Ridley-Thomas, supervisor for the Second District, which includes most of South Los Angeles, assured the trustees and guests that the project will represent not only economic growth but also economic justice. There will be legal aid clinics as well as small business advisory services for community entrepreneurs.
“This is a project that will integrate the community of South Los Angeles with the one of the prominent educational institutions in the country,” Ridley-Thomas said.
Nikias said that the university’s board of governors and community leaders worked hard for more than three years in order to get the plans approved by the Los Angeles City Council. More than 1,000 supporters of the university participated in council meetings prior to the vote on the plan. At the end of the dialogue, the City Council voted unanimously to allow for the construction of the project.
The project will use no taxpayer funds or government subsidies. Instead, it has been made possible by monetary gifts such as a $30 million dollar endowment by the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation for the Honors Hall.
“This project will transform the residential life at USC,” said Kathleen Leavey McCarthy, chairman of the foundation and a  USC trustee.
During the conclusion of the ceremony, Nikias said that the Village would be the largest university project for the next  50 years. He recalled how 100 years ago, the university was considered a commuter school.
“Not anymore,” Nikias said. “After the conclusion of this project, USC has no one else to catch up to.”

Children are notorious for being the toughest food critics, and I was no exception. Immediately after my mother would pick me up from elementary school, I demanded to know what was for dinner. Spaghetti with tomato sauce was a reliable weeknight staple, as was anything that came out of Grandma’s kitchen. While I crinkled my nose at leftovers and reluctantly accepted grilled salmon, I absolutely loathed boiled chicken. Anything sounded more appetizing than the pale, flavorless poultry plopped on my plate with a side of steamed broccoli. When I began cooking for myself in college, however, I came to appreciate the convenience and versatility of this simple item.
Colorful and tasty · Chicken salad lettuce cups are a fun way to liven up bland but dependable boiled chicken by mixing it with an assortment of vegetables and tangy Greek yogurt then serving it in a lettuce cup. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
For the college cook, a mild protein such as boiled chicken forms an ideal base for just about any recipe. Here, I have incorporated it into two quick, healthy and inventive salads. I recommend preparing the chicken in advance, and then storing it in the refrigerator for use throughout the week.
The first salad — arugula with crisp chickpeas — strikes a balance between simple summer fare and warmer fall flavors. Browning canned chickpeas in a bit of olive oil, thyme and red pepper flakes provide heartiness and great texture. The four-ingredient lemon vinaigrette keeps the salad fresh and bright, perfectly complementing the peppery arugula and shaved Parmesan.
For my lightened-up version of traditional chicken salad, I mix in lots of colorful vegetables and replace the usual mayonnaise with tangy Greek yogurt. Yogurt delivers the creaminess of mayo without the guilt, and the dish stays fresh for longer.
Basic Boiled Chicken
• Two 4-ounce boneless, skinless chicken breasts (preferably organic)
• Salt and pepper
Active: 5 min; Total: 30 min
1. Season each side of the chicken breasts with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Fill a large pot two-thirds of the way with water and place over high heat. When the water is boiling, add the chicken to the pot and reduce the heat to medium-high.
2. Boil the chicken for 20 minutes and then turn off the heat. Cover the pot and allow the chicken to cook for another 5 minutes.
3. To check if the chicken is done, cut through the thickest part of the breast. The meat should be white throughout, and the juices should run clear. Cooking times may vary based on the thickness of each piece.
The boiled chicken can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days.
 
Arugula Salad with shredded chicken and crisp chickpeas
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• One 15-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed and dried
• 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
• 4 sprigs thyme
• 3 cups arugula
• 1 cup shredded boiled chicken (from 1 large boneless, skinless breast)
• 1/2 cup Parmesan shavings
• Salt and pepper, to taste
For the lemon vinaigrette:
• 3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
• 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
• 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon pepper
Total: 15 min. Serves four.
1. To make the vinaigrette, combine the lemon juice, vinegar and mustard together in a small bowl. Slowly stream in the olive oil, whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a medium skillet set over medium heat. Add the chickpeas, red pepper flakes and thyme, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are golden brown and crisp. Transfer the chickpeas, arugula, shredded chicken and Parmesan to a large serving bowl. Pour the vinaigrette over and toss gently to coat. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
 
Chicken Salad Lettuce cups 
• 3 cups shredded boiled chicken (from 3 large boneless, skinless breasts)
• 3 celery sticks, diced
• 1 red or orange bell pepper, diced
• 1 cup shredded carrots
• 2 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
• 1/2 cup Greek yogurt or light mayonnaise
• 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1/2 teaspoon pepper
• 8 large leaves of iceberg or romaine lettuce
Total: 15 min. Serves four.
1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken with the diced celery, bell peppers, shredded carrots, lemon juice, Greek yogurt, mustard, salt and pepper. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.
2. To serve, spoon about 1/2 cup of the chicken salad into each lettuce cup.
Serving the chicken salad in romaine wedges makes the dish gluten-free, but feel free to substitute whole-wheat bread if you prefer.

It’s pretty difficult to turn on the radio and not hear Nico & Vinz’s hit “Am I Wrong.” It rocketed to the top of the charts over the summer with its powerful melody, rhythmic beat, unique sound and, of course, an uplifting message of pursuing dreams without apology. The duo’s first album as Nico & Vinz, Black Star Elephant, drops Sept. 16 and will solidify their reputation for being catchy and sending positive messages, while also adding depth to their already unique pop sound. Simply put, be prepared for more Nico & Vinz stuck in everyone’s head.
Those who attended the Welcome Back Concert will recognize several songs and will be happy to learn the rest of the album follows the distinct Nico & Vinz sound, emphasized in the tribal-pop trend set by “Am I Wrong,” “In Your Arms” and “Last Time.”
The album contains 21 tracks, seven of which are interludes showcasing the duo’s African roots and their thematic content. These short tracks feature little music but  rather highlight words of wisdom, such as these lyrics from “New in Town”: “There will be obstacles on your road, but the challenge will be your teacher.”
The African influence is not, however, exclusive to these interludes. Many songs have short snippets of foreign languages, such as the bridge of “People,” which is spoken in French, and “Imaa Imaa,” which means “Striving, Striving” in Yoruba. Each song embraces their heritage in varying ways, from distinct drumbeats to chanting elements to tribal-sounding instruments. The whole album blends this influence with refreshing acoustics and the upbeat pop sound we know and love from “Am I Wrong.” “Last Time,” “Another Day” and “Runnin’” are sure to be hits for the specific sound the duo manages to create: infectious vocals and acoustics with a dance-worthy rhythm. The new elements add a dash of the exotic that only benefit the album, adding depth to the pair’s overall sound.
Oftentimes, the songs begin with stripped acoustics, featuring one instrument paired with bass or a beat. As the songs develop toward the chorus, the minimalist sound grows to a climactic influx of instruments. This rise-and-fall pattern continues throughout the song, heightening the addictiveness of each chorus and emphasizing the lyrics of each verse.
Nico & Vinz’s messages mostly center on their personal struggles and the intense desire to follow their dreams as the world works against them, much like the messages conveyed in “Am I Wrong.” The determination that characterizes their first hit is reflected in “When the Day Comes,” which declares in its first verse, “Why can’t I sleep when it’s two in the night? / ‘Cause the fire in my soul / The fire in my soul got me ready to fight / And I’m ready for war.” The song also has a lively beat despite the combative lyrics the artists are singing. “Another Day” expresses gratitude to God for each day, mentioning the social injustice around the world in short segments of rap but remaining positive with a delightful contrast between piano and almost electronic elements. “Homeless” has a cheery melody and a memorable rhythm, and voices their struggles to find a place called home as Afro-Norwegian young men. A similar theme of self-discovery and identity is expressed in “Know What I’m Not,” which is an anthem of personal reflection that further deepens their tribal-pop sound.
Some tracks focus on more romantic interests, but are equally catchy and uplifting. “Runnin’” and “Last Time” in particular are reminiscent of Chris Brown, and will have listeners dancing in their seats before the first play on the radio is over. “Runnin’” is just plain musical fun. “Last Time” is flirtatious but more pleasing to the ear (“I’m drowning in your sea / And I don’t want no one to save me”). The duo’s second single, “In Your Arms,” is already a hit in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, likely for its hopeful and hopeful message, which pairs perfectly with the happy acoustic guitar and catchy beat. It declares, “Life is a journey where you stumble and fall / But I’m okay / When I lie down in your arms.”
Black Star Elephant is universally happy, something every pop/acoustic/tribal music fan is bound to enjoy. For fans of other genres, one listen of the album — even if they don’t love every song — will have them moving to the beat. As a debut album, Nico & Vinz found the mark and surpassed it: fans of their first hit will spread their love to the whole album, and new fans will soon emerge. The music world should prepare for more Nico & Vinz. And if that means more genuine artistry in the music industry, who could object to that?

In 1993 while he was a power forward for the Phoenix Suns, Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Charles Barkley did a television commercial for Nike. The minimalist black-and-white spot had Barkley performing various athletic moves on a basketball court by himself. And amid a symphony of screeching sneaker soles and thunderous bounces of a basketball on hardwood, it was Barkley’s first sentence that rang the loudest: “I am not a role model.”
Athletes are not role models. Tell anyone on the street who has heard about Ray Rice, Greg Hardy and Adrian Peterson, among countless others. They’ll tell you the same thing: “You’re damn right they’re not.” So why does America continue to be shocked by the actions of athletes, and why does the sordid fascination with their private lives persist? It’s as if the fact that being able to carry a ball a couple yards while getting tackled by 280-pound men puts them on a higher level of moral accountability. It doesn’t.
Barkley’s declaration is as salient more than 20 years after its release as it was controversial and thought provoking in 1993. The world, enamored with the disarming smile and the mind-blowing marketing potential of basketball’s greatest competitor in Michael Jordan, turned a deaf ear to Barkley’s assertions. Why would Barkley say such a thing at a time when Jordan, perhaps America’s biggest role model, was enjoying the zenith of his popularity?
Perhaps Barkley felt and saw from an athlete’s perspective the untenable nature of living up to the standards of a Jordan. Some high-profile athletes maintain a carefully manicured image throughout their careers to optimize their marketability. Their characteristics make them de facto role models, but a distinction should be made: For every Michael Jordan, there are countless others who are not as admirable. Just ask the players in today’s game who fall victim to ceaseless comparisons to His Airness — LeBron James and Kobe Bryant have transcended the game with their conduct off the court in their own ways. Bryant endured legal troubles over sexual assault allegations, and James was cast as a villain for his departure from the Cleveland Cavaliers, and though both eventually recovered, they always seem to fall short of Jordan’s seemingly bulletproof legacy.
If athletes aren’t supposed to be role models, then what is an athlete’s function? Athletes are paid on the basis of their capabilities to contribute to a team, and their role in helping the team win. The money these athletes receive are contracts derived primarily through viewership; ticket revenue from attendance at games and money from television contracts.
When NFL contracts are negotiated, the primary point of leverage is an athlete’s performance in comparison with another athlete; rarely is the athlete’s marketability or their reputation off the field taken into strong consideration unless there are serious interests that would lead to an athlete being suspended from play.
Carolina Panthers defensive lineman Greg Hardy, who was convicted on two counts of misdemeanor assault on a female and communicating threats, was paid $770,588 for his non-participation in Sunday’s game. Carolina head coach Ron Rivera announced Monday that Hardy would not be suspended but that the organization would continue to evaluate the situation before deciding on his active/inactive status for next week’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to SB Nation. The distinction to be made is that suspension is punitive without pay, whereas active/inactive status still means Hardy is paid.
The outrage machine was in full force, with an editorial in the Charlotte Observer calling for Hardy’s suspension from the team, going so far as to state that Panthers’ owner Jerry Richardson “jeopardize[d] his moral credibility by covering for [Hardy].”
There’s a problem with this line of logic: It implies that Richardson has a moral responsibility to suspend one of his team’s assets for an action that the player performed outside the supervision of the team. Richardson has no such legal obligation given the pending nature of Hardy’s appeal, which is set for jury trial on Nov. 17. The crux of the problem is that Hardy is a valuable asset to the Panthers, and there are no stipulations in place barring his participation in games.
To contrast, there’s Dallas Cowboys’ owner Jerry Jones and his actions when former Cowboys’ wide receiver Michael Irvin stabbed teammate Everett McIver in the neck with a pair of barber’s scissors in an altercation in 1998. The Dallas Morning News reported that Jones brokered a “high six-figure settlement” between McIver and Irvin in exchange for McIver’s silence regarding the incident. Irvin had pleaded no contest to felony cocaine possession in 1996, and a violation of his parole could have resulted in Irvin being sentenced to 20 years in prison.
The Irvin-McIver incident occurred during a convenient wrinkle in time in which information did not travel nearly as quickly as it would now. If such a thing were to occur in today’s day and age, Irvin would undoubtedly have been thrown in prison — and would not be a studio analyst for the NFL Network, which he currently is.
The world has come a long way since the Irvin-McIver incident. Bridging the speed of information travel between 1998 and now would take much longer than the space in this column permits. But should athletes continue to be considered role models despite everything we know about them? It’s hard to conceive what constitutes a proper role model these days. But with every dollar an athlete is paid for a jersey sale or endorsement contract on the basis of his or her reputation comes a significant responsibility to uphold the name that gets printed on the back of a jersey or signed next to an “X” on an endorsement contract.
It’s time that the NFL and other leagues took strong preventative educational measures, instead of outright punitive ones, to address athlete accountability off the field. If off-the-field issues become the customer’s business, it’s time the NFL seriously make it their business — before it explodes in their face like it has in the past few weeks.
In the meantime, don’t expect your athletes to be role models.

They don’t get paid obscene amounts of money to play with a ball in a vacuum.  They play for millions of fans and like it or not, need to  be held accountable to a sense of decency.  The ONLY reason many hold them as role models is because they are in the public eye.  If they wanted to avoid that and earn regular pay then perhaps a job at a desk would have been better suited.  It’s a trade off isn’t it?

USC women’s basketball head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke has announced that senior guard Ariya Crook has been removed from the team due to a violation of team and university policy.
Gone baby gone · Senior guard Ariya Crook led USC in points per game last season while helping her team reach the NCAA Tournament. Crook was dismissed from the team for a violation of team and school policy. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
“We wish Ariya the best and appreciate her contributions to our program over the past three years,” Cooper-Dyke told USC Trojans. “She will have the opportunity to finish her academics but will no longer be involved with this program. It’s a blow to our team, for sure, but we are a resilient group.”
Crook started 31 games last year for the Women of Troy, leading the team with 15.8 points per game and 69 three-pointers, and was third on the team in assists with 2.3 per game. She was an All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention recipient and MVP of the 2014 Pac-12 Tournament, where she finished with 15.8 points per game. Crook is also fifth in USC history with 138 career three-pointers.
The Los Angeles native also had a productive sophomore campaign, finishing the 2012-2013 season with per game numbers of 13.4 points, 2.9 assists and 1.2 steals. All of those numbers were good for second on the team, even though Crook only started nine games.
Overall, Crook finishes her USC career with per-game averages of 11.6 points, 2.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game, while shooting 35 percent from the field, 33 percent from behind the arc and 78 percent from the free throw line.
The loss of Crook is especially problematic for the Women of Troy since they also lost forward Cassie Harberts to the WNBA this April. Crook and Harberts were USC’s top two scorers last season. Harberts led the team in average minutes played (32.9), while Crook was third (28.0).
Crook put up a career-high 34 points in USC’s upset of No. 16 Cal last year. That was the most points a USC women’s basketball player had scored in a single game since 2002.
The Women of Troy will look to put the loss of Crook behind them as they hope to continue improving under Cooper-Dyke, who led them to a 22-13 record (11-7 Pac-12) in her first season, along with the program’s first NCAA tournament appearance since 2006.
Despite losing Harberts and  now Crook, Cooper-Dyke made a strong effort to improve the program in the offseason with the hiring of long-time San Diego State head coach Beth Burns as an assistant.
USC will get back on the court on Nov. 9 with an exhibition against Concordia at the Galen Center at 2 p.m. The team will open the upcoming season at South Carolina on Nov. 15, with their home opener taking place on Nov. 23 against Fresno State.

A third of the way into the 2014 campaign, the USC women’s Soccer team continues to evade defeat.
The No. 14 Women of Troy beat Pacific 3-0 Friday afternoon and left Orange County with an extra-time draw against UC Irvine Sunday evening, improving their record to 5-0-2.
Sole goal · Junior striker Katie Johnson came up with USC’s only goal in Sunday night’s 1-1 extra-time draw at UC Irvine. The Monrovia, California native has two goals so far this season, pushing her career total to 10. – Samuel Chang | Daily Trojan
Another successful weekend began with a tough first half against the Tigers that saw USC struggle to score.
Despite a number of opportunities, head coach Keidane McAlpine was displeased with the team’s first-half performance.
“[The first half was] sloppy,” McAlpine said. “I didn’t think we were sharp in our movements and our passing, especially around the box and around the goal.”
The first-year coach’s halftime messages and adjustments have already proven to do wonders for this team, as the Women of Troy continue to turn tough first-half deficits into stellar second-half performances.
Just two minutes into the second half against Pacific, junior forward Tamara Mejia finally put the Women of Troy on the board. Mejia, who entered the game as a substitute, finished her run down the left flank by netting her first-ever career goal as a Trojan into the lower left side of the net.
Sophomore defender Kayla Mills followed up with a beauty of a shot into the upper left corner at the 63-minute mark, giving the team room to breathe and giving herself her second goal in two games.
“I do what I gotta do for the win,” Mills said. “I just do what the team needs me — drop back [or] push up when they need me.”
Senior midfielder Alex Quincey finished off the win with a clinical header off of junior Reilly Parker’s corner kick. Coming off a hat trick against UC Riverside, the midfielder added to her team-high season tally of five goals and capped off the much-improved second half that Coach McAlpine wanted.
“I thought our response in the second half was pretty good,” McAlpine said.
More importantly, McAlpine was impressed with the defense’s ability to shut out Pacific, one of the primary goals this squad looks to achieve in every single match.
Senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley was also thrilled about the shutout, but she credited her hardworking defensive front for it.
“The defense definitely earned it today,” Stanley said. “They single handedly got the shutout themselves.”
Though the shutout kept their winning streak intact, the Women of Troy were forced to forget the win against Pacific quickly and travel to Anteater Recreation Center Field to take on a UC Irvine squad that had won three straight games.
The Sunday night match between the Women of Troy and the Anteaters was a clash of winning streaks, but it also quickly became a clash of defenses.
McAlpine was finally given the fast start he has been looking for all year when junior forward Katie Johnson scored her second goal of the season in the seventh minute off a Mejia cross and a flick by junior midfielder Natalie Donaldson.
It looked like the Women of Troy were well on their way to their fifth straight win, but the Anteaters would not go down that easily, and the match suddenly evolved into a defensive battle.
USC relentlessly sought the match’s all important second goal, but the UCI defense refused to back down.
It was only a matter of a time before great defense turned into productive offense for the Lady Anteaters. Home fans finally rejoiced in the 75th minute when Kiana Palacios put the ball past Stanley, ending the shutout and tying the game.
The late goal — which came off a free kick — pushed the duel into extra time.
Two 10-minute extra periods still failed to separate the two squads, and the Women of Troy could not manufacture a second goal even while dominating the game offensively.
A draw allows USC to retain its undefeated record, but a win certainly seemed within reach. Nevertheless, McAlpine welcomed and appreciated the tough challenge that UC Irvine gave his team.
“This was great preparation for us,” McAlpine said. “Irvine played great and brought good energy. I am glad we got a result in this type of game.”
The Women of Troy return to action during a two-game, non-conference set that pairs them against Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Pepperdine on Friday and Sunday at McAlister Field.

California’s gubernatorial election is just two months away. Currently leading by 21 points among likely voters, Democratic incumbent Jerry Brown holds the edge over Republican challenger Neel Kashkari. The odds, due to everything from finance to experience, are stacked at staggering heights against Kashkari, but the public shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss him as nothing but an underdog. Though he might lose this election, Kashkari’s win will be in reviving an ailing Republican brand.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
At a glance, the political novice, Kashkari, 41, is probably unlikely to oust Brown, 76, who has spent a lifetime in politics.
According to a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, only one in four California voters can even identify Kashkari. A major part of the uphill battle, though, is the “R” following Kashkari’s name. Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman’s loss to Brown in 2010 — despite pouring over $140 million of her own money into campaigning — demonstrates this point clearly.
But if there’s any candidate that’s able revive the GOP brand, it’s Kashkari.
To generate attention, Kashkari has made up for his funding shortage with creative tactics of his own, tactics that present him as a different kind of Republican, one with character. This summer, he marched in the San Diego gay-pride parade, and he routinely speaks in black churches, the Economist reported. In July, he spent a week living as a homeless man in Fresno, sleeping on park benches, looking for work and eating at shelters in hopes of highlighting California’s poverty rate. Critics brushed it off as a publicity stunt, but it’s admirable for any politician to really get out there and sleep on the streets in the name of calling attention to the state’s uneven economic recovery.
Darry Sragow, a USC adjunct assistant professor of political science, told SF Gate in 2010 that Republicans will remain dead in California until the party “decides it won’t be hostile to people who aren’t old and white.” By his actions alone — from the homeless venture to the parade marches — Kashkari demonstrates his appeal to a spectrum that’s much broader than that “old and white” group. His roots also show his ability to relate to other demographics.
“My dad wasn’t governor … My parents were immigrants. I was a middle-class kid,” Kashkari said in a debate with Brown on Sept. 4. “I think Gov. Brown means well, but his 40 years in government have left him out of touch with the struggles of working families.”
Raised in Ohio, Kashkari bagged groceries and mowed lawns before pursuing an engineering degree and a career in finance. He’s lived the American Dream and gives hope to reversing the traditional — and crippling — image of the GOP as a party of privileged people.
The tide seems to be turning already. The day after the gubernatorial debate, news site Breitbart reported that Kashkari was trending on Facebook. For a Republican candidate in such a blue state, this attests to Kashkari’s solid performance. According to Carla Marinucci, a senior political writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, during the debate, “Kashkari was ferociously scrappy, well-prepared and unafraid to challenge the governor.”
It’s clear that for Kashkari, the race is about more than just votes in November — it’s about winning the hearts and minds of independents and the thousands of voters in California who have left the party. So far, he’s doing well.

California Gov. Jerry Brown’s approval rating currently stands at 58 percent, and if polling is any indication, that won’t be changing any time soon. A recent poll conducted by the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times found that the incumbent governor, as he seeks an unprecedented fourth term, holds a strong lead over his Republican challenger, who most voters can’t even identify.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
 
For those who don’t know the opponent, his name is Neel Kashkari.
Though young and seemingly more moderate than most of his Republican peers, Kashkari is very much an underdog in this race. Not only is the 41-year-old political novice and former U.S. Treasury official running as a Republican in a largely democratic state, but he’s also running a campaign against a three-time incumbent with a political career nearly as old as he is. That incumbent has managed to balance consistent approval from his Democratic and “decline to state” constituents, as well as approximately 18 percent of his state’s Republicans.
That’s a lot to expect any challenger to overcome. Add to it the fact that Kashkari is also tasked with rebranding the Republican Party, one that maintains its more fiscally conservative values while also embracing moderation when it comes to social issues such as marriage equality and women’s health rights, and you almost can’t help but feel sorry for the guy.
To add insult to injury, the USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll found only one in four likely voters could identify Kashkari by name.
“Incumbents are defeated when the challenger gives the voters a compelling reason to make a change, and Kashkari simply hasn’t been able to attract enough attention to make that case to voters,” Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur told USC News. “California is a very, very steep hill to climb for an underfunded Republican candidate running for statewide office.”
Had Kashkari chosen to run against an unpopular incumbent in a struggling state, it is likely that he would have been able to make a dent in the electorate — at least enough to afford name recognition. But when voters head to the polls on Nov. 4 to cast their ballots, if they go at all, they certainly won’t be voting for a virtually unknown candidate — especially when they’re not averse to the only familiar name on the ballot.
Kashkari’s obscurity among the electorate isn’t solely due to his lack of experience or campaigning resources. In fact, this lack of recognition is endemic among most voters when it comes to local politics. According to FairVote, though approximately 60 percent of American voters turnout to vote for presidential elections, only 40 percent of the eligible voting population votes during midterm elections. Had the USC Dornsife/L.A. Times poll asked respondents to name their state senators, judges or local mayors, it’s unlikely they would have been able to respond any differently.
With less than two months until the election, Kashkari probably won’t be able to garner enough name recognition to secure even a narrow defeat. At the end of the day, most voters won’t know his name — and voters shoulder some of that blame.

This might seem like bad news for Neel Kashkari – and it is – but it’s also bad news for Hillary Clinton. There are Dems looking for an alternative to the former First Lady and Jerry could be it. Fresh off a stunning victory against a moderate, NOT Tea Party Republican, Jerry can take that to the bank if he starts showing up in Iowa, New Hampshire, etc. And with the bad blood between Brown and the Clintons, Brown may simply enjoy getting in just to torpedo Hillary.
