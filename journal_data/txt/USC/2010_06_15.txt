For years, USC fans waited to hear the result of the NCAA’s long-standing investigation into the school’s athletic program.
What they heard Thursday wasn’t what they expected.

In a 67-page report the NCAA compiled and released to the public at noon Thursday, the collegiate athletics governing body found instances proving a lack of institutional control and numerous violations involving the two primary suspects: “student-athlete one” (Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush) and “student-athlete two” (one-and-done prep star O.J. Mayo.)
The NCAA’s four-year investigation centered on the school’s alleged football- and basketball-related violations, relating largely to against-the-rules benefits Bush and Mayo received while attending USC.
The USC football program received a two-year bowl ban and a loss of football scholarships – 30 scholarships over a three-year period, 10 annually. Both football and basketball will also be put on four years probation.
With its ban from postseason play, USC becomes the first Football Bowl Subdivision school to be so punished since the Alabama served a two-year ban last decade.
Bush, who was ruled ineligible in 2004 and 2005 by the NCAA, was the subject of much controversy after he left the football program. His dealings with two would-be sports marketers — Lloyd Lake and Michael Michaels — were investigated by the NCAA, Pac-10 and the FBI.
In turn, USC has been ordered to forfeit every victory that Bush participated in while ineligible. The two-year bowl ban also comes as a direct result of Bush’s ineligibility, according to  Committee of Infractions director Paul Dee.
“I am disappointed by [Thursday’s] decision and disagree with the NCAA’s findings,” Bush said in a statement Thursday. “I will continue to cooperate with the NCAA and USC, as I did during the investigation. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on making a positive impact for the University and for the community where I live.”
USC managed to avoid further punishment that would have imposed a television ban on the football team. The NCAA found that the sanctions it chose to  impose “respond to the nature of violations and the level of institutional responsibility.”
The Trojans’  basketball program and the women’s tennis team were also cited in the report the NCAA compiled with its findings on the athletic program
The NCAA did not take any further action against the basketball program.  Earlier this year, the university self-imposed sanctions on the basketball team, banning it from postseason play, forfeiting victories from Mayo’s lone season at the school and reducing the number of scholarships for the next two years.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, USC basketball coach Kevin O’Neill said he agreed with the decision to self-impose sanctions but said he couldn’t speculate on whether it should have been an option for the football  program.
The women’s tennis violation involved Romanian athlete Gabriela Niculescu, who has since transferred to Idaho.  According to the report, USC chose to vacate all the wins — from 2006 to 2009 — she participated in.
The university has announced plans to appeal the NCAA’s football-related findings, which could affect the timetable of the punishments. If the appeal has not been ruled on by mid-January, USC will technically be eligible to compete in any bowl game for the 2010 season.
USC also released the original 169-page report it submitted to the NCAA in December 2009. From the report, the the Trojans hope to prove their relative innocence.
“There is some guilt in some penalties, but the punishment is too severe and that’s why the appeal process is taking place,” first-year coach Lane Kiffin told media members in USC’s Heritage Hall on Thursday.

Hollywood has been catering to 1980s nostalgics lately. With its recent remakes of and belated sequels to ’80s films, Hollywood has been looking backwards, hoping to capitalize on childhood nostalgia with increased ticket sales.
The latest example of this trend is Joe Carnahan’s The A-Team, and while it might not be the finest film ever made, it certainly typifies a high point for this 1980s revival kick.
Lock and load · Newly minted Hollywood heartthrob Bradley Cooper (left) stars as Face, unabashed ladies’ man and protégé of Liam Neeson’s Hannibal (right). The A-Team opened wide-release on Friday. - Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox 
The original television series blended the typical case-of-the-week format with parody of 1980s action films. It was a pastiche of the Reagan era, where all-American soldiers would use military know-how and an increasingly larger set of explosives to prevail over the bad guys, usually communists or corrupt officials. Every week the A-Team enters a town, finds problem and confronts the bad guys. After being locked up, the rogue special ops unit cobbles together a weapon McGyver-style, Mr. T’s B.A. Baracus beats someone up, and despite the thousands of bullets expended by both sides, no one ever gets shot. It was silly, over the top and extremely popular.
The film adaptation transplants the characters to the present day and strives for a more serious tone, but stays surprisingly true to the concept. After taking a mission from the CIA, the A-Team is convicted for a crime the members didn’t commit. Knowing the people who set them up got away, they promptly escape from various maximum security prisons to clear their names. Still wanted by the government, they chase after their framers while trying to avoid their pursuers.
Joe Carnahan previously directed the action-comedy Smokin’ Aces, in which an assassination contract leads to weirder and weirder characters showing up and ludicrous fight scenes breaking out, and his over-the-top action style fits the movie.
The A-Team is the kind of film where overkill is everything, and despite the film adaptation’s more grounded approach, the ridiculous is commonplace. There are crazed bank heists, midair battles with a tank, The Fast and the Furious-style car races and a climax influenced oddly enough by an old-school arcade game and Batman Begins. It’s a bit silly, and uses a few too many action movie clichés, but it captures the insanity of The A-Team rather well.
The problem is the plot is very weak. Though the film stays much more grounded than the television show, the actual plot is never sufficiently fleshed out to give the film a thriller element. Even when the bad guys are fully revealed, their scheme is not.
The entire movie feels like a series of gags and fights only loosely strung together by a feeble narrative. Even worse, the government officials pursuing the fugitives take up a good quarter of the film, and every time they are on screen, the film’s pacing comes to a dead halt.
The characters make the film work. Each actor is entertaining in his own right, but its in his onscreen interactions and bonding with other characters that The A-Team really shines.
Liam Neeson plays the team’s leader, Col. Hannibal Smith, a man who revels in being 12 steps ahead of his enemies. Neeson never gets any meaty dramatic moments in which he can really shine, but his gravitas and charisma help to ground the film and center the other characters. Bradley Cooper is the No. 2 man, Face, half protégé to Hannibal, half ladies’ man.
Quinton “Rampage” Jackson steps into the shoes of Mr. T as B.A., and while he is still able to take down numerous enemies with his bare hands, he plays the part with a much more laid back attitude compared to Mr. T’s constant aggression. It surprisingly works, and while his arc in the film is a bit predictable, he contributes a great deal of depth to a one-note character.
However, the highlight of the film is the team’s pilot, Murdock. Played by Sharlto Copley — he previously starred in last year’s District 9 and the short film that spawned it — Murdock is truly insane. Whether it is masquerading as a doctor, changing accents at a moment’s notice or giving color commentary to a fight scene, Copley steals every scene he is in. Even in the background of a scene, his antics are noticeable and entertaining.
The A-Team is not perfect. It is a bit predictable, with a weak plot and hit-or-miss action. This year’s earlier release The Losers did a much better job executing the black-ops-team-on-the-run concept. However, the cast is very entertaining, and Copley’s humor is definitely worth it. Ultimately, the film is a lot like the decade that spawned the television show: a lot of style, not much substance.

Three non-USC males were shot on the evening of Tuesday, June 8, west of Vermont Avenue near the university, resulting in two deaths. The shootings were most likely gang-related, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.
The first shooting occurred at 5:20 p.m. near 35th Street and Budlong Avenue when police say a man in a white T-shirt approached the victim and shot him, fatally wounding him.
Ten minutes after the first incident, four men shot and killed the second victim near Normandie Avenue and 35th Place. The suspects then drove away from the area in a black Pontiac, according to witnesses.
The third shooting occurred near Catalina and 36th streets at 9:30 p.m., when police said a suspect shot and injured the victim. Witnesses did not see the suspect, but said he might have left the area in a burgundy Cadillac.

LAPD requested the assistance of USC’s Department of Public Safety in response to the incidents, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
“According to LAPD, this appears to be gang related and this appears to be specifically targeted victims,” Carlisle said. “It appears that [the three shootings] are related.”
In response to the incidents, DPS plans to increase its presence in the area of the shootings, Carlisle said.
“We are going to redeploy a variety of our DPS resources into that neighborhood … in hopes of discouraging any further violence,” Carlisle said.
DPS released a university-wide crime alert early morning Wednesday, June 9, 2010.
The victims are not connected to the university, but students in the area should be alert, Carlisle said.
“When there’s that kind of violence in a neighborhood, students should be concerned and take reasonable caution,” Carlisle said. “We hope that they take the crime alert to heart.”
“Students should continue to follow our normal crime prevention tips:  Don’t walk alone late at night, take advantage of Campus Cruiser and other transportation services, be aware of your surroundings, and if you see something suspicious or you perceive something that doesn’t feel right, call DPS,” Carlisle said.
Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call DPS at 213-740-4321 or LAPD Southwest Area at 213-485-6571.
Always good to see California gun laws in action!  
I’m sure the gentlemen who pulled the trigger were law abiding citizens, who had completed the necessary background checks (and, thanks to proactive California statutes, waited 10 days) and thankfully didn’t have hi-capacity magazines – that would have been tragic.  But they’ll be found, and surely pay a few rehabilitating years in overcrowded prisons for their reckless actions.
Sarcasm aside, it is yet another instance of pure nonsense.
Sad.

For the second consecutive season, USC water polo standouts and 2008 Olympic silver medalists Kami Craig and J.W. Krumpholz took home collegiate water polo’s highest individual honor, as the graduating seniors were named 2010 recipients of the Peter J. Cutino Award at a ceremony held last week at The Olympics Club’s City Clubhouse in San Francisco.

Craig edged out Stanford’s Jessica Steffens and teammate and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year Tumua Anae, who led the Women of Troy with 270 saves, for the award. Stanford’s Jimmie Sandman and Drac Sigo were named the other male finalists for the Cutino Award, but finished second and third to Krumpholz.
The award, which is named after legendary California water polo coach Peter J. Cutino, is presented annually to the nation’s top male and female collegiate water polo player, as voted on by Division 1 coaches including USC’s own Jovan Vavic.
Craig, an outgoing redshirt senior two-meter who finished with 36 goals on the year, helped lead the Women of Troy to a 25-3 mark and its first national championship since 2004 last month.
But Craig, who becomes the first woman to win the award in successive seasons, will be remembered for more than just her 2010 campaign, as she is coming off one of the most prolific careers of any player in school history. With a career total of 152 goals, the senior two-meter is presently ranked eighth all-time on USC’s career scoring list and was recently named a first-team all-American for the second straight season.
On the men’s side, Krumpholz becomes just the third male all-time to have won more than one Cutino Award during his career. In 2009, the outgoing senior two-meter served as USC’s third-leading scorer with 37 goals en route to leading the Trojans to their second consecutive national championship – a first in program history. Krumpholz also became the first Trojan to be named National Player of the Year in back-to-back seasons and also earned first-team all-American honors as well in 2009.
As with Craig, Krumpholz will further be remembered for his body of work that stretched over a span of four seasons. Presently, he is ranked eleventh all-time at USC with a career scoring total of 138 goals — an indication of the offensive prowess that he often displayed.
Craig and Krumpholz remain USC’s sixth and seventh recipients of the prestigious award. Furthermore, the sweep of both the men and women’s awards marks the third in program history after Juraj Zatovic and Lauren Wenger took home the hardware in 2006 and Craig and Krumpholz did the same in 2009.

While rain and winds may have been staples at the 2010 NCAA track & field Championships, these disruptive elements were not enough to keep the Trojans from their best finish since 2007.
The USC men’s team placed fifth after four days of competition in Eugene, Ore. This result signified the team’s sixth consecutive top ten finish.
“Based upon the weather and how we performed, I thought we maximized what our potential was,” said Ron Allice, director of USC track & field.
Even though Allice may have been satisfied with the performance, his high expectations for the team signify his resistance to merely settle for the men’s consistent championship success.
“My goal was to have us in the top five in the country, and that’s where we finished,” said Allice. “Was I happy with the top five? To some extent. The idea is, we wanted to be better than that.”
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
While the team may have hoped to finish even higher in the standings, many Trojans had performances that warrant recognition. One player, whom Allice recalled as having “one heck of a meet,” was sophomore Joey Hughes.
Hughes placed in both individual and team events. Not only did he help the men finish fifth in the 4 x 400 relay after running the third leg of the race, he also placed third in the 400-meter dash. He recorded a time of 45.23 seconds, just .02 seconds behind the runner-up.
Hughes became a two-time All-American as a result of his performance at the championships.
Other Trojans who were granted All-American status include redshirt senior Manjula Wijesekara, who finished second in the high jump; junior Oscar Spurlock, who placed fourth in the 110-meter hurdles; and redshirt senior Aaron Dan, who took the fifth place spot in the discus final.
One unfortunate moment for the men’s team came in the 100-meter dash. Senior Ahmad Rashad was disqualified after he was called for a false start in his semifinal heat. Rashad placed second in the race at last year’s championships and was considered the likely favorite at this year’s event. At the conclusion of the meet, the men’s team had earned 35.5 points, just 1.5 fewer points than the fourth-place Arizona State Sun Devils and 19.5 points fewer than the first-place Texas A&M Aggies.
But the Women of Troy were unable to earn any team points throughout the competition and, thus, finished unranked, a disappointing result that hadn’t occurred since the 1981 season.
“We had just, really a lot of letdowns where I felt we did not perform anywhere close to what we were capable of,” Allice said of the women’s team.
With the season over and many players graduating and moving on, the Trojans now face the task of rebuilding and strengthening, with the hope of more success in the upcoming year.
“The recruiting class that we’re bringing in has got to step in and fill the void,” Allice said.

Victim.
A noun defined as one who is subjected to oppression or mistreatment. However, it can also mean one that is tricked or duped.
Yes, that pretty much sums up how USC’s student body feels in the wake of a devastating blow, that even months of waiting couldn’t have prepared us for.
The numbers resulting from the NCAA’s stand for culpability are simple: the football team will face a two-year ban from postseason play, the forfeiture of 14 wins from the 2004 and 2005 seasons, the loss of 30 scholarship offers over the course of the next three years, and a potential removal of the 2004-2005 BCS national championship.
While the facts and figures might seem straightforward and self-explanatory, finding the collective strength to get up from this disheartening sucker punch requires a commitment and a plan.
It might not be fail-proof, but here is my attempt to help all of you through this time of great sorrow and frustration.
1. Throw a pity party. For those of you who still haven’t come to grips with what has transpired, don’t be afraid to let it out. Watch hours of low-quality reality TV shows or Law and Order re-runs, eat pints of ice cream, tear down posters, create Facebook pages in protest and even make T-shirts with catchy slogans. Do whatever it takes to cope, because after all this wasn’t your fault.
2. Make your voice heard. Sure heading up message boards and online groups says something, but if you want to vent, why not direct that pent up anger and energy towards the people who need to hear it: the athletic department, the school’s administration, TV outlets or even the sports pages of the Los Angeles Times.
If you have a gripe, speak up. If you feel the school, the athletic program and its chief representative, he-who-shall-not-be-named, neglected its athletes and the student body, act — don’t wallow.
3. Sport a new trend. There is nothing more rewarding as a fan than rooting for a proven winner. It’s what has made our generation of Trojan fans so confident when making the walk over to the Coliseum every fall. While the biggest moneymaker and arguably most-prized source of entertainment on campus has taken a bit of a hit, if you love sports, if you love watching your school compete on the highest of levels, find a more obscure team to root for.
Men’s basketball makes its triumphant return from its one-year ban next fall. The water polo program will be showcasing not one, but two, defending national championship teams next season. And can you say “three-peat?” Well that’s what the men’s tennis squad hopes to achieve next year. While you may not find a Heisman Trophy candidate or household name around every nook and cranny of this university, there are student-athletes in other revenue sports yearning for some love. Now is as good a time as any to show them some.
4. Be your brother’s keeper. For every upperclassmen — center Kristofer O’Dowd or fullback Stanley Havili, just to name a few — who have worked tirelessly the past few seasons with the goal of reaching a BCS title game, their dreams are shattered. For every high school standout — like running back Dillon Baxter or wide receiver Kyle Prater — that took a leap of faith on this program, in spite of what looked to be a precarious situation, their futures have been put in jeopardy for events that took place while they were still playing Pop Warner.
So I am putting every student who claims to bleed cardinal and gold and their fanhood on the chopping block. Even in good times, our student section isn’t exactly the most raucous group in college football, let alone the Pac-10 (or should I say Pac-who-knows?) For the first time in your college experience, don’t be the small fish in a big pond. Make each game your main priority. Yes, even ahead of tailgating and snapping endless potential Facebook defaults. These players, your peers, friends and fellow students need you more than ever. It’s time we all had their back.
5. For everything, learn, learn, learn. While it pains me to drag the late John Wooden into a story that serves as a complete antithesis to his selfless character, the legendary coach said it best: “Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It’s courage that counts.”
Although this may be a lesson that falls on deaf ears, his words preach a message befitting of this ordeal.
No matter how much you have achieved in sports or in life, no one is above the law. Unfortunately, this university has found that out the hard way. But it’s a non-permanent reality check, and that might be exactly what USC needs.
Call it a lack of accountability, a failure in the leadership hierarchy or just plain recklessness, but years of ignoring the warning signs and dismissing opportunities to act courageously even if it meant losing some national exposure and money along the way, proved to be the straw that broke this camel’s back. It’s a shame and it stings. but it could have been avoided. But this intervention was necessary for everyone, and in the big picture will actually strengthen an impure program.
6. Find a silver lining. Maybe this step is trite, but there’s comfort in finding a positive in a negative. Two years is not a lifetime. Sure it closes the books on a chance for a significant portion of the student body from witnessing a potential run at a national championship game, but beneath turmoil there is an opportunity to look beyond what could have been and start appreciating what is.
Adverse times might not be the ideal moments to sort through your emotions. Six days might not be enough time to repair the damage. And whether or not my steps to renewal guide you during these unfamiliar times, take solace in knowing you are not alone. The challenge of fighting on in spite of what has transpired will certainly not be easy, but it is a defining point in our legacy as a student body.
Every action has a reaction, and under these unwelcoming circumstances, that onus falls on every individual associated with this university.
The time is now to show that “We are ’SC,” the University of Strengthened Courage.
“For The Love Of The Game” runs every other Wednesday. To comment on this article, e-mail Dave at dulberg@usc.edu.

USC’s School of Pharmacy received a grant of $401,370 from UniHealth Foundation last week, a non-profit organization whose stated mission is to facilitate community-based activities. The foundation has already funded much of the school’s involvement in safety net clinics.
The grant will fund the “Pharmacist Clinical Service Delivery Expansion and Medication Safety Improvement” project, in which the school looks to bolster its Center for Community Health clinic near Skid Row. Besides improving the clinic’s quality of care, the funds will also provide for full-time, residential pharmacists and student volunteers. The ultimate goal of the grant is to increase patient coverage.
“It has been tremendous for the School of Pharmacy and the community that UniHealth has supported us through our work in these clinics,” said Kathleen Johnson, chair of the Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics & Policy, in an interview with USC News.
The UniHealth Foundation initially helped build the program from the bottom up — a program that has been succeeded by more than 100 safety net clinics.
“The USC School of Pharmacy’s commitment to safety net providers is exemplary,” said Mary Odell, president of the UniHealth Foundation, in an interview with USC News.
In addition to the clinic on Skid Row, the USC School of Pharmacy is also helping run several other safety net clinics around Los Angeles County, including South Central Family Health Center and Clinicas Del Camino Real in Oxnard, Calif.

Last Wednesday found many Trojans hoping that, as in the previous weeks, media outlets ominously reporting the impending NCAA sanctions were misinformed. This time, however, the NCAA didn’t see its shadow and retreat for another six weeks.
USC was steamrolled by sanctions that include a two-year bowl ban, loss of 30 scholarships and forfeiture of victories won during Reggie Bush’s sullied tenure.
USC has already announced plans to appeal the findings, as fans question the legitimacy of punishing a new administration so stridently for the former one’s mistakes. But whether the appeal proves fruitful, there is more to be taken away from this situation than simple indignation.
Regardless of qualms about the severity of the sanctions, the fact remains that our athletic program has strayed into ethically troubling areas. It’s time for administrators to enforce a strict new regimen and use this setback as a chance to reform the image of Trojan sports into an untarnished one.
As the football program moves into a transitional period with former coach Pete Carroll’s departure and coach Lane Kiffin’s premiere season fast approaching, we have a chance to set a precedent of policing ourselves on all levels — from the players to the leadership of the athletic department.
USC supporters have proven themselves to be fair-weather fans in the past. Now is not the time to question the refundability of tickets or lament a collapsing colossus. The only way to prove that our touted “Fight on!” slogan is appropriate is to support our athletic program as enthusiastically as we did when we were on top.
Rather than debate the sanctions, the athletic department needs to rebuild from the bottom up — reviving its fan base, supporting its players and cleaning up its act.
I completely agree with Rob H.   Why are the current athletes and coaches being punished at all?  It’s outrageous and un-Democratic.    If it’s learned that a Senator broke ethics rules after he retires, does the current Senator pay the price?  Of course not.  
If the NCAA is going to be the regulating, judging and punishing force, then it needs to have the authority to punish the agents and players who are the ONLY people who should be punished.  Frankly, coaches aren’t babysitters.  Coaches aren’t causing the infractions.  How can any coach realistically keep track of dozens of athletes?  They have no authority to check bank accounts, car titles, wallets, mortgages…. nothing.   It takes the NCAA sometimes years to find and research the infractions and yet it expect coaches to do it by themselves while they are coaching?  It’s ridiculous to expect a coach to be able to monitor the off hours of a player, which is when these infractions occur.
Fine the agents and players where it hurts–perhaps 20 times the amount of the infraction–period.  So, if the dollar amount was $100,000, then the penalty to the agent and athlete is $2,000,000 each.  That hurts them, not the young athletes that had nothing to do with the situation.
Ok, so here’s what I don’t understand:  Why are all the principals going unpunished?  Reggie Bush, O.J. Mayo, Gabriela Niculescu, and Pete Carroll seem to be the ones who actually broke rules, yet they all seem to have avoided any repercussions.  The university and athletic department certainly weren’t up to the job of enforcing the rules, but it makes no sense to put the policeman in jail and tell the criminal he’s free to go just because the policeman didn’t catch him the first time.
Why doesn’t the NCAA have, as a standard part of the athletic scholarship contract, a clause imposing large monetary penalties for student athletes who cheat and leave?  Frankly, I think the harshness of USC’s punishment is, at least in part, a result of the NCAA’s embarrassment of its own institutional impotence when it comes to punishing student athletes.
Solid article with a solid position. As an incoming freshman, this is everything I want to see and support as I join the Trojan family.
The athletic dept. needs to clean their own house starting with the AD then filtering out some of the others. A couple of head coaches need to be replaced first with baseball and the sad state of affairs that has become, Second with woman’s tennis who has not performed that well in fifteen years and now with the revelation that one of their former players used an employee telephone card to the tune of $7,000 of international calls. These are basic steps to take being no brainers.

It’s probably not too much of a stretch to say that Drake has had a pretty hectic year.
It does indeed seem like an eternity since a fairly successful Canadian rapper released a mixtape that featured a little song called “Best I Ever Had,” rocketing the aforementioned rapper into the upper echelons of the hip-hop community. At the very least, it’s hard to imagine Drake, born Aubrey Graham, toiling away on demos and on the set of Degrassi: The Next Generation now that he’s become a superstar, mugging it up in advertisements and rolling with Lil’ Wayne’s prodigious Young Money crew. Until now, followers of Drake from before and after his explosion on the scene have been left only to wonder about the particulars of his astronomical rise to stardom.

According to his new official debut album, Thank Me Later, things were confusing as hell. Unsurprisingly, it appears that issues arose from his drastic change in lifestyle — issues that subverted friendships, family ties and business relationships. Drake seems willing to reveal these hardships in clear-cut honesty, perhaps finding some solace in the relief afforded by owning up to personal shortcomings. And the songs that expose the rapper’s vulnerable side — the Aubrey Graham side of things, if you will — really work. It’s hard not to feel a twinge of heartache when you hear lines like I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets / Secrets you were telling everybody but me: Don’t be fooled by the money, I’m still young and unlucky, which he flows on “Karaoke.”
In some ways, the Aubrey Graham persona that Drake adopts here and there on the album is like the Kanye West that listeners heard in 2008’s 808s & Heartbreak: a man struggling to find good intention in an unforgiving landscape that more often than not rewards those who use their heads, not their hearts.
Thank Me Later’s first two tracks are quietly brilliant examples of this ethos — “Fireworks,” featuring a melancholy chorus showcasing Drake’s sweetly capable singing voice paired with Alicia Keys’ gorgeous alto, and the aforementioned “Karaoke,” a track undeniably reminiscent of something off West’s 808s in the best way possible. The tracks blend the struggle of a new life in the spotlight with the swagger of success in a perfect harmony, sounding somber but hopeful.
Then comes the third track, “The Resistance” and the album takes a turn for the — well, bipolar. As a listener, it’s hard to tell what Drake is trying to say in this song. Unlike with the previous tracks, which hit a logical balance between boasts and fears, “The Resistance” is sheer ambivalence in action. In one moment, he wallows in disappointment (I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home / And I’ll be acting like I don’t know how to work a phone) and less than 10 lines later executes a 180 back to reaffirming how good he has it (Nothing really comes as a surprise right now / ’Cause we havin’ the time of our lives right now).
It’s this ambivalence that shows up around the album that keeps it from ever coalescing into a progressive album that makes sense. In one song Drake will brag about his multiple conquests while in another he takes the one-on-one romance up to 11. Somewhere else he’ll mention that he’s never going to change even with fame, even though earlier in the album he bemoaned how he treats people differently now. It all feels a little jumbled up — maybe the life Drake lived really was like this, but regardless it makes listening to Thank Me Later a two-faced experience. Maybe it is more than fitting that Drake changes his mind about the whole matter and, on the final track, asks that we “thank him now.”
It doesn’t help that the album is lacking at times from a musical standpoint. There are a few tracks with outstanding background compositions — the lead single “Over” is one such example, featuring a frenetically layered mix of crackling snare, bells, horns and a triumphant string section. The Kanye West-produced track “Find Your Love” is similarly successful in combining alluring synthesizers and piano with a driving, electro four-on-the-floor beat.
Drake demonstrates his uncanny abilities of wordplay and rhyme, especially when he mixes up the tempo of his words (“Show Me a Good Time”). However, too many of the songs slow down in legato orchestral compositions that all end up sounding similar in one way or another. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the songs are bad, but it does make the album tricky to sit through. The way that Drake raps can become a bother too — his constant-flow delivery of lines, dropping words like sixteenth notes, begins to sound machine-like after a while and become almost monotonous to listen to.
Yet, all is not lost. The album is an honest achievement and a work in transition for a young and developing artist, one that shows room for improvement but also displays tenacity and talent. There are a few gems on the record, and some well-timed and well-executed guest appearances turn otherwise merely decent pieces into worthwhile numbers (Nicki Minaj’s appearance on “Up All Night,” to name one).
Thank Me Later probably isn’t the best that Drake could’ve produced, but it’s definitely a good starting point. With a little luck, we actually will be thanking him later.

Ramin Niroomand knows the value of hard work.
A founding member of the San Diego-based post-hardcore band In Fear and Faith, Niroomand has worked for five years to develop the band into what it is today: a mean, lean touring machine that has taken a break not to unwind but to write and record a new album, Imperial.

“In confidence, we’re probably one of the hardest working bands in the business,” says Niroomand.  With over 300 shows notched in its belt from last year alone, that statement is probably not an exaggeration.
It’s fitting that In Fear and Faith’s growing success was cultivated in a distinctly 21st century foundation, the Internet (MySpace, more specifically).  In many ways, the band is a success story for a new era of music distribution, one that simultaneously makes it superficially easier to be found but also fundamentally harder to stand out in a crowd of thousands of bands trying to be discovered. But In Fear and Faith, Niroomand said, has always gone the extra distance.
“Technology has brought it to a point where you don’t need a million-dollar recording. There are bands out there that don’t even use real drums or bass guitar,” he said.  “What we’ve tried to do is create something with a little longevity.”
It seems to have worked for the new album, which at first glance is more of the post-hardcore that everyone’s heard before — scream-y verses intertwined with hook-laden choruses and heavy bridges — but upon further inspection is something far more intricate.  “The Solitary Life,” for instance, features an intriguing layer of cascading strings, and “Bones” contains more strings and a warmly contrasting piano line in the incredibly melodic chorus.  It’s a great sign for the band, because it allows it to slip free from one of the most common criticisms of the post-hardcore genre — that everyone sounds too much the same.  Niroomand couldn’t agree more.
“I think there are so many bands that are regurgitated attempts at what’s been done before,” he said.  “A lot of stuff sounds too similar … As rude as it may seem, I’m not a fan of much out right now.”
The new album, he said, was recorded with a clear focus on being more creative, more independent from the scene than ever before.  In Fear and Faith probably won’t appeal to listeners who don’t have at least some interest in the post-hardcore genre; however, Imperial is a strong effort toward becoming a band that can truly stand at the top of the scene with a distinctive sound all of its own.
“Our whole goal going into the studio was our heavy parts need to be heavier … but our heavy parts have to also be relatively intelligent,” Niroomand said.  “Our catchy hooks … we wanted to be ten times as memorable.  We tried to enhance everything.”
For the most part, this strategy has panned out as intended.  Although there are some weak points — some of the lyrics perhaps border on cliché, and some riffs could be embellished — the album overall is an impressive effort from a band that is still relatively young, at least in terms of big-time public exposure.
The Vans Warped Tour, which In Fear and Faith is set to play this summer, will go a long way toward introducing the band to a new and hopefully receptive audience. The tour, of course, is one of the most legendary music tours for alternative music genres like indie rock or punk, and Niroomand points out that this year’s Vans Warped Tour boasts a significantly stronger lineup than last year’s.
“I’m very excited for this Warped Tour, and I think it’ll be remembered for a while,” he said.
Life in a band that’s trying to break out is never easy.  The hours are long and decisions, both in and out of the studio, can make or break future success.  But Niroomand is thankful for what the band members have already achieved, and as far as he’s concerned, they’re living the dream.
“It makes me so happy to be busy in the music industry,” he said. Not that being busy also means not having fun.  In Fear and Faith, for all of its hard work, doesn’t seem to show any sign of burning out any time soon, and Niroomand certainly seems to participate in his share of some classic rock ’n’ roll mishaps.
“I’ve embarrassed the hell out of the band on stage while drunk,” he said. It’s indicative of their overwhelming energy and tenacity that the band is able to unwind by living it up on tour.
“We’re definitely the band that likes to party,” he said. “We really try hard to maintain a responsible level of alcohol consumption, though.”
All the same, the musicians still seems to know that nothing comes without hard work.  Maybe that’s why they insist on going the extra mile to provide background production for their live shows. And maybe that’s why they make an effort to actually have a light show. It’s this sort of effort that, looking from the outside in, is undeniably admirable.
“We try to make sure that these cheap 10, 15 dollar tickets are worth it,” Niroomand said.  And for now, the future looks bright for In Fear and Faith.  Perhaps the band name, taken from a song by influential and critically acclaimed indie band Circa Surive will serve as a lucky charm on its way to the top.  But if and when it does get there, at least no one will be able to say it wasn’t from hard work.
“We bust ass and go nuts,” Niroomand asserted with a chuckle.

Last Tuesday, two men were killed and one injured in series of gang-related shootings to the west of campus. The final shooting was also the closest, taking place near the intersection of Catalina and 36th streets, a block from the Vermont Avenue entrances to the university.

The distance between the scene of this third shooting and the perimeter of campus was roughly equivalent to the space between McCarthy Quad and the Pertusati Bookstore. Walking at a leisurely pace, it would take most students less than five minutes to cover that area.
To say the shootings were close to home would be an understatement. They took place right on the school’s front porch.
Though no USC students were harmed in the day’s ordeals, it’s just as unnerving to know that there were three shootings that occurred less than a half a mile from the enclave of the university.
Following the incidents, LAPD investigations concluded that the shootings were most likely gang-related homicides, with each of the victims a premeditated target.
In recent years, the USC community has made a concerted effort to reach out to help address problems related to gang violence. The School of Social Work offers a course, titled Adolescent Gang Intervention (SOWK 350), in which students collaborate with city officials to work on gang prevention and intervention strategies.  In addition, former football coach Pete Carroll’s “A Better LA” organization has worked to try to curb the alarming pattern of gang violence in the area.
But while the successes of such efforts have been well documented, there have still been sobering reminders of the status quo.
In October 2008, alleged gang members shot USC track team member Bryshon Nellum just northwest of campus. There is still no clear motive for the crime.
Last week’s shootings serve as the latest reminder.
Unfortunately, the shootings will do little to dispel the belief that the area surrounding USC is a hotbed of rampant crime and dangerous activity. Rather than resorting to the de facto apoplectic rant that paints the school’s safety efforts as ineffectual, we should acknowledge the fact that while such events are unfortunate, the work of the university and local law enforcement has curbed them.
Already, DPS has pledged to increase its presence in the area through a “variety of DPS resources” where the shootings took place in an effort to curb any further violent acts.  But this move is reactionary in nature, especially considering the fact that the plan was to redeploy resources that had been utilized in the area once before.
To build upon this relative success, DPS should move to expand its proactive measures in order to better safeguard the area around campus, much in the same way that it encourages students to take prior precautions to ensure personal safety. If nothing else, this could establish a presence that will preempt possible violent acts.
For instance, while the distribution of DPS personnel currently seems to be based on the largest concentrations of students around campus — especially to the north — it would be greatly beneficial to have a stronger presence in areas of the off-campus perimeter particularly susceptible to crime, regardless of the spotty student population.
Taking such precautions, would serve as a great step toward DPS’ stated goal to “create a safe and secure community.”
