Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry is meeting with students throughout the rest of the semester to gather feedback on qualities they want in the new provost. The search for a new provost comes after outgoing Provost Elizabeth Garrett accepted the president position at Cornell University in late September.
Student input has never been used before in the search for a top administration officer. According to Carry, it was President Nikias’ initiative to involve students.
“President Nikias wanted student input in the process,” Carry said. “Part of my assignment is to gather student input and bring it back to the [selection] committee.”
To reach out to these student organizations, Carry enlisted the help of his staff in Student Affairs to ask student groups if they’d like to speak about the provost search.
Carry has already met with the Panhellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, Undergraduate Student Government and Recreational Sports. He is also planning to meet with other groups, including international students, student leaders in Residential Student Government and graduate students.
So far Carry has gathered two major qualities desired in the new provost: accessibility and a dual commitment to academics and student life.
“No students want us to lose any ground in this tract to be the best academic institution we can be, but at the same time no students want to lose any part of the USC experience — living in Los Angeles, great athletic tradition and quality student life,” Carry said.
Carry also said applications might even come from within the existing USC community, citing President Nikias and former Provost Garrett as examples of USC administrators who moved up in rank. President Nikias was the dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering and Garrett was a professor in the USC Gould School of Law before their most recent positions.
Carry hopes a new provost can assume office by the next school year. In addition to holding public meetings, Carry encouraged students to reach out electronically via surveys that USG will be emailing out.

Blackstone LaunchPad at USC, the Annenberg Innovation Lab’s cross-campus entrepreneurship program celebrated its grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday.

To celebrate the official launch, Blackstone LaunchPad hosted Executive Vice Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Michael Quick, Walter Annenberg Chair in Communication and Dean of Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Ernest Wilson, City of Los Angeles Chief Innovation Technology Officer Peter Marx, Director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab Jonathan Taplin and Executive Director of the Blackstone Charitable Foundation Amy Stursberg. Student entrepreneurs also had the opportunity to showcase projects they have created with Blackstone Launchpad’s assistance.
“I know that some folks have made the argument that young people may be better off taking their entrepreneurial vision and doing it outside of academia and maybe giving up on pursuing that college education, but through efforts like the LaunchPad we are rejecting such false choices and recognizing that one can do both and this gives students a leg up in their career to be both well honed in academics and well honed in entrepreneurship,” Quick said during the ceremony.
Blackstone LaunchPad at USC was made possible by a $3.5 million grant from the Blackstone Charitable Foundation. The grant established a partnership between University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, Irvine; USC and the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. Blackstone LaunchPad announced the partnership in February 2014. It has 15 other locations at different universities around the country.
“We look at specific regions around the country where we think there is an entrepreneurial vibe, and we target schools with a culture of innovation but aren’t cracking the code 100 percent,” Stursberg said. “We came to Southern California and looked at about 10 schools and USC was just a,  ‘Wow.’”
Blackstone LaunchPad has given student entrepreneurs the skills they need to advance their projects through mentorship programs. The program has been working with over 70 startup teams, a total of over 200 students since its soft opening earlier this year.
Sydney Liu, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, spoke at the ceremony about how Blackstone has assisted him in the process of creating Talent Trail, a company that streamlines the internship recruiting process.
“Blackstone has been extremely helpful due to their mentorship and introductions they’ve helped us make. We also have over 900 students on the platform now because of what Blackstone has helped us do,” Liu said.
Jordan Banafsheha, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration and the founder of Bread & Butter, spoke about his company that he presented at the Blackstone LaunchPad Demo Day in New York last week. Bread & Butter takes food retailers with a daily food surplus and connects them with with underserved communities. Banafsheha said he has benefited from Blackstone LaunchPad’s stewardship program that helps students establish connections with schools around campus.
“Blackstone LaunchPad helped us secure a relationship with Gould School of Law, and helped us get into the small business clinic so that we’re now a legal company,” Banafsheha said.
Other student projects that are working with Blackstone LaunchPad include Desert Farms, America’s first retail camel’s milk company, Q-Cigarettes, a tool to help quitting smokers, and Piggy, a company that helps users save money by depositing all change from purchases into their bank accounts.
With such a strong culture of innovation at USC, Executive Director of Blackstone LaunchPad at USC Erin Reilly said that Blackstone LaunchPad will provide an opportunity to engage with entrepreneurship at any level, regardless of experience.
“We’re here to foster the entrepreneurial spirit and be a stepping stone,” she said. “[We want to] map the ecosystem so we can provide a very informal and experimental experience for students who are maybe not in the business school or the StartUp Garage in  Viterbi, but they just want to start something and they don’t know where, so we are a very soft touch to help students guide them through taking their concept into something more.”

The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted its final Students Talk Back panel of the semester this week, entitled “Making Sense of the Midterms: A Post Election Analysis.” The panel consisted of Anthony Portantino, former California Assemblymember, 44th District and an adjunct professor at USC; Anthony Russo, a partner at the public affairs company Russo Miller and Associates; Alec White, president of the USC College Democrats and Jordan Tygh, vice president of the USC College Republicans. The panel was moderated by Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute and Anshu Siripurapu, news editor of the Daily Trojan.
The panel opened with a general discussion of the effects of the midterm election within California. White noted that the Democratic party presence in the state was strong.
“A lot has to do with how Jerry Brown is as a governor,” White said. “A lot of other states [that] have difficulty with losing democratic seats also had poor governorships.”
The panel also discussed Brown’s challenger, Neel Kashkari, a moderate Republican who panelists agreed help to bolster the opinion of the G.O.P. in California, where Republicans won several important Assembly seats.
“The top of the ticket helps the rest of the race,” Tygh said.
The discussion then moved away from the election itself to the future of the state under fourth term Governor Brown.
Portatino discussed the possibility of a more cautious legislature following the Republican gain of one-third of the State Assembly seats.
“With two new Democratic leaders and the supermajority right on the edge, and a governor who has shown a lack of interest in raising taxes, I think there is going to be some interesting conversation moving forward,” Portantino said. “It’s going to be an interesting time for Democrats in power because even though they are in power there’s going to be a pause for cause.”
He believed that though Democrats would not be able to carry out their decisions as effectively with the addition of the Republicans, this could be beneficial in resulting in better decision-making.
“When you have to stop and think about what you do typically you make better decisions … There are still enough votes to make things happen, but they will have to take a more pragmatic approach,” he said.
The discussion of state politics then segued into a discussion of the midterms in the national context. Panelists were eager to discuss the Republican sweep for a majority in the House and Senate, as well as analyze the broader implications for national politics.
“I think the more pragmatic Republicans will be looking at the White House [now],” Portantino said. “Everyone is giving themselves credit for the sweep to try to position themselves for the presidency.”
Russo attributed Republican success in this midterm to the return of moderate G.O.P. representatives, as opposed to 2010 Tea Party sweep which saw Democratic backlash during the 2012 general election.
“There are different Republicans just like there are different Democrats,” Russo said. “There was a huge push to not let Tea Party Republicans take control of the 2014 election.”
White commented on the disappointing national results for the Democrats.
“Historically Democrats have had a very strong turnout machine but they didn’t do that so well this year … I think this year we weren’t as aggressive. We didn’t have a clear theme or message,” White said. He added that he felt that the party’s base of young people and minorities were not motivated to go to the polls.
The panel then turned its attention to 2016, and the possible slate of presidential candidates.
“I think you have to say at this point that the Republican tide has the potential to have legs in 2016,” Portantino said. He mentioned, however, that they needed to prove themselves following this midterm sweep in order to make that happen.
“With responsibility and authority you have to make decisions,” Portantino said. “They can no longer be the party of no.”
Russo agreed and added an important note for the future of California.
“Nationally, I think Republicans have to prove that they can govern and then they will have the opportunity for the presidency,” Russo said. “The real question in California is, will Republicans be able to hold on to the gains that they made in this election in 2016?”
As they moved on to potential presidential candidates, the panelists agreed that Hillary Clinton seemed to be the Democratic frontrunner.
“Hillary [Clinton] has not announced, but as my mother always said, ‘if Hillary Clinton is breathing Hillary Clinton is running,’” White said, to audience laughter.
White said that he believed other potential nominees such as Senator Elizabeth Warren and current Vice President Joseph Biden weren’t popular enough to gain the support of the wider Democratic party.
Tygh commented on the Republican Party’s lack of a similarly popular candidate.
“I think the difference between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party is that … there is not just one person that everyone is rallying behind,” Tygh said.
Tygh did comment, however, on the possibility of a serial presidential campaigner other than Clinton returning in 2016: Mitt Romney.
“I don’t think you’ll see a Romney comeback, but there are some donors pushing for it and some supporters pushing for it, and if he gets enough support you might just see it. I think if he ran he would be the nominee,” Tygh said.

This Friday night, the USC women’s soccer team hosts archrival UCLA at the Coliseum. I will be there. Not because I have to cover the game — our excellent beat writers Ben Albert and Paolo Uggetti can take care of that. Not because our football team is in the middle of another long, boring bye week. And especially not because I’m a soccer fanatic. I will be there for one reason, the same reason over 90,000 of the Trojan faithful cross Exposition and navigate the Rose Garden on Saturdays: It’s going to be a lot of fun.
The big stage · Junior midfielder and captain Jamie Fink was just a freshman when USC upset No. 2 UCLA at home two seasons ago. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
I understand if you don’t believe me. There are plenty of excuses not to make the trek out to this match, especially as a busy USC student. So because I’d like to avoid getting lost among a sea of parents and high school coaches on Friday night, let me try to ease some of those doubts. And don’t worry, hypothetical fellow student. I’ve thought of everything.
Right off the bat, aren’t we gonna lose? Like, pretty badly?
Yeah, that’s possible. The undefeated, top-ranked Bruins are the reigning national champions. They’re on top of the Pac-12, the nation and probably the universe. The Women of Troy are a talented squad, but they’re unranked and fighting for an NCAA tournament bid. On paper, it’s not an even matchup. But as anyone who watched UCLA stun No. 2 USC at the Rose Bowl in 2006 can tell you, rivalry games aren’t played on paper. Anything can happen.
Yeah, but that’s football. Do we actually have a chance to win this soccer game?
You bet we do. We’ve even done it before. A little over two years ago, I watched former USC midfielder Jordan Marada and the unranked Women of Troy upset the No. 2 Bruins in one of the most thrilling sporting events I’ve ever witnessed. The match ended on Marada’s overtime winner, the closest thing I’ve ever seen to an honest-to-goodness, buzzer-beating goal. It was absolutely brilliant, a golden goal so perfectly timed that the opposition had no chance to respond. I wasn’t the only one there to see it, either. At least 30 students stormed McAlister Field to celebrate, as a similarly dominant UCLA squad — one that went on to reach the NCAA quarterfinals -— walked away in utter disbelief. Wouldn’t that be fun to see again, in a night game at the Coliseum no less?
O.K., but come on. This is soccer. College students don’t get excited about soccer.
Some do. The men’s game between UCSB and Cal Poly — dubbed the “College California Clasico” by NBC’s Men in Blazers — draws thousands of students, while hundreds more can’t even get tickets. UCSB students are known for their soccer fanaticism, including tossing tortillas onto the field after a home goal. Now I’m not claiming we steal that tradition, but wouldn’t it be fun to start one of our own?
Those schools don’t even have football! USC students barely even come out for basketball games. It’s all about football, all the time.
Technically, Cal Poly has an FCS football team, but that’s neither here nor there. Though I admit it’s tough to imagine USC students getting pumped up for a non-football sport, it does happen. Anyone who came out to see the Trojans pick up their fifth consecutive national title in men’s water polo two years ago can attest to that. Students packed the stands, suffering through rain and cold weather to see USC knock off UCLA. It wasn’t an isolated event, either. Uytengsu Aquatics Center was rocking for a regular season matchup between the No. 3 Trojans and the No. 1 Bruins just this past Sunday.
Ok, you got me convinced. I’ll give this whole soccer business a try. We better not get blown out…
I can’t guarantee that we won’t! Just like -— not for lack of trying — I couldn’t guarantee that our football team would overpower Boston College. But I can guarantee that if you grab a group of friends and head out to the Coliseum this Friday night at 7:30 p.m., you’re gonna have a good time. And isn’t that what college is all about?

It all comes down to this. After traveling to the Pacific Northwest and beating two ranked conference foes, the USC women’s soccer team faces its biggest challenge of the year this Friday night: hosting the No. 1 UCLA Bruins.
Striking distance · Senior midfielder Alex Quincey and the Women of Troy can stake their claim to an NCAA playoff berth with a win on Friday. – Striking distance · Senior midfielder Alex Quincey and the Women of Troy can stake their claim to an NCAA playoff berth with a win on Friday.
 
The crosstown showdown will be played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this year, a fitting stage for what should be a huge matchup between two of the top three teams in the Pac-12 standings. On one side, UCLA (17-0-2, 9-0-1 Pac-12) is one win away from an undefeated season, while the Women of Troy (12-5-2, 6-4) are vying for an upset and an NCAA tournament berth.
A win against the best team in the country would almost certainly clinch USC a spot in the national tournament, and though they have a solid chance to get in no matter what happens on Friday night, a victory would give the Women of Troy immense confidence heading into the postseason.
USC’s confidence may already be surging, however. The squad showed its resilience when it responded to a three-game losing streak by traveling to Oregon and Washington the past two weekends and coming back home with wins in all four games. The two sweeps were crucial to the team’s postseason hopes, especially given the magnitude of this final home match.
“Coming from the downward frame we were on, I thought finding results was absolutely imperative,“ head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We needed to find victories and that was big for us.”
Those victories not only gave the Women of Troy a confidence boost ahead of this match, but also a much-needed boost in the Pac-12 rankings, where they jumped from 10th place all the way up to third place in a matter of two weeks.
“Any time you get wins in this league, you gotta think you’ve done something big,” McAlpine said. “It’s a huge step, and a huge positive toward the postseason.”
In their most recent trip this past weekend, the Women of Troy triumphed over two top-25 teams in then-No. 17 Washington and then-No. 22 Washington State. Now, they’ll need to do the same against the top-ranked team in the nation if they want to defend their home pitch.
The Bruins are one of the most dominant teams in NCAA soccer history. Not only have they progressed through their entire season undefeated, but they have also outscored their opponents 52-4 through 19 games. The team is riding a nine-game winning streak — taking place over the course of an entire calendar month — in which goalkeeper Katelyn Rowland has only allowed a single goal.
On the other side of the ball, the Bruins are fueled by the remarkable play of midfielder Sam Mewis. Mewis is responsible for 25 of her team’s 52 goals, with 11 assists and 14 scores of her own. Also fueling UCLA’s attack are forward Taylor Smith and midfielder Sarah Killion, who have each slotted in seven goals.
USC’s offense, on the other hand, has woken up since its three-game losing streak and has found the net six times in the last four matches. The Women of Troy are led by senior midfielder Alex Quincey, who has sparked the team off the bench with 10 goals. USC’s other scoring leaders include junior midfielder Jamie Fink and junior forward Katie Johnson.
The Women of Troy undoubtedly know the stakes and what this rivalry entails, and even first-year coach McAlpine knows and understands the hype and excitement surrounding the Crosstown Cup.
“Whenever you get a chance to play the No. 1 team in the country — UCLA aside — that’s an opportunity that you cherish,” McAlpine said. “It just happens to be UCLA and that just adds a little more to it.”
Still, McAlpine says that both he and the team are still focused on their main goal from the beginning of their season. No matter who their final rival may be, they’re keeping their eyes on the real prize.
“Our goal still stays the same — it was to get to the NCAA’s and to do well in the NCAA’s,” McAlpine said. “That’s our focus in this game, and it’s one more game to prepare us for that.”
This rivalry match will kickoff under the Coliseum lights this Friday night at 7:30 p.m.

With the graduation of USC’s all-time leading scorer Nikola Vavic last season, the main man for the Trojans has been senior driver Kostas Genidounias. Hailing from Athens, Greece, the 6-foot-1 Genidounias has been an absolute scoring machine for the Trojans, posting 64 goals on the season.
Top Dog · Though he scored a remarkable 80 goals last season, then-junior driver Kostas Genidounias still could not match Nikola Vavic’s team-leading 81. This year, Genidounias’ 64-goal output is tops among Trojan scorers. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
Following the Trojans’ tough 10-8 loss to UCLA last weekend, Genidounias found some time in his busy schedule to give an interview to the Daily Trojan and talk about his pursuit of the school’s all-time scoring record, his “recruitment” and his least favorite exercise in practice.
 
DT: My first question would be that this season’s been called a “rebuilding year” because Nikola Vavic graduated and you’re taking over, but here you guys are again in the hunt for a national title. Would you characterize this as a “rebuilding year” for you guys?
KG: We have eight freshmen players playing significant minutes, so on the one hand it is a “rebuilding year,” but on the other hand we are contenders for a national championship. We feel like we’re there and we can win it. So we’re rebuilding because there are so many players, but we’re contending for a national title.
 
DT: You’re 11 goals away from passing up Nikola Vavic for the all time scoring record at USC. Was this one of your goals going into the year?
KG: Yeah, it is one of my goals, but I try not to let it affect my game and make me selfish or make me not pass the ball. It’s not as important as winning another championship.
 
DT: You wanted to be at USC, and you have an interesting recruiting story. You had to wait a year, can you talk about why it was so important to come to USC specifically?
KG: I just knew that they were number one, and that there was no other place I’d rather be.
 
DT: I heard a story where you emailed coach Vavic and reached out to him first.
KG: Yeah, I graduated a year early, when I was 17, and I e-mailed coach Vavic and a bunch of other schools but [Vavic] wasn’t really interested in the beginning. Then, that summer I played in the European Championship with the Greek Junior National team, and I had the letter of intent from LMU in my hand right before the European Championships but I decided to wait a little bit.
I went to the European Championships and played really well, my team got second place, we lost in the penalties to Italy. I won MVP of the tournament, and as soon as I got home I emailed Jovan. He asked me for my number and he immediately gave me a call, and he asked me if I could wait for a year and I said, ‘Yeah, I would love to.’”
DT: You’re in your last year. Do do you have any plans after you graduate, athletically or otherwise?
KG: I definitely want to go back home to Greece and try to play professionally for a couple years and try out for the Olympics with the national team.
DT: Diet is really important for all athletes, but especially water polo players. What does your average meal look like?
KG: In the morning I go to the Athletic Department where I can get breakfast burritos and bagels … I try to combine carbs and protein most of the time; carbs for energy for practice later on and proteins later on in the day. At the end of the days, after practice, I eat protein for the recovery process. Sometimes I burn too many calories, sometimes I go for a little dessert, like ice cream. One of my guilty pleasures.
 
DT: Does coach have a specific diet for you guys?
KG: He doesn’t have something specific for us day-to-day, but throughout the season when we go to tournaments and games, we always stick to pasta and light red sauce, or rice and potatoes. He always goes for chicken, you know, no red meat.
 
DT: What’s your least favorite thing to do in practice?
KG: I would say leg workouts with weight belts. Jovan loves his weight belts. Even though it’s a necessary thing, I’d say that’s my least favorite thing.
 
DT: Do you have any advice for club-level or high-school water polo players as far as what it takes to succeed and move onto the collegiate level?
KG: Commitment. Dedication. If you’re not all-in, if you’re not passionate about it, you can’t do it. Water polo is a sport where you really need to be committed and it takes a lot of effort to get to the next level.

Neil Young is a legend of folk music, with a career that has spanned generations and a collection of hits unmatched in his field, and the singer and environmentalist has showed no signs of stopping — even at the age of 68. His newest album, Storytone, was recorded with a live orchestra accompanying each track, and the high-concept album is both beautiful and heartbreaking.
Fighting on · Neil Young has been through a lot over the last year. He divorced Pegi, his wife of 36 years, he started a music company and finished his latest book. Through all this, he still managed to record his 35th album. – Photo courtesy of CBC
Some of the most well-known folk bands of all time included Neil Young in their ranks, and it is no coincidence that he is still making hits. From Buffalo Springfield to Crazy Horse to Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, the artist has left an indelible mark on folk music, and he has kept up his blistering pace. Young just put out an album in the spring, entitled A Letter Home, and in addition to his own work, the folk singer has also worked on other artists’ albums, lending his guitar to a song on Chrissie Hynde’s Stockholm. Storytone is his 35th studio album, a number few artists will ever achieve, and although it has its flaws, it is still a benchmark of lasting musical talent.
His sound may have mellowed since the early days of Buffalo Springfield, but Young still has a lot of music left to create. On Storytone, the native Canadian opens up about his recent divorce and other poignant moments in his life thus far.
There are a couple tracks on the album that are seemingly about his divorce from wife Pegi, and they are all heartbreaking reminders of the pain that lost love evokes. “Like You Used To Do” is a ballad on how things used to be, and it could bring a tear to anyone’s eye, a common theme with Young’s songs.
In the last year, Young has been through a lot. He has successfully started a music company, Pono, which is dedicated to allowing listeners to experience their favorite songs in higher quality, finished his second book and begun the process of divorcing his wife of 36 years. Through all this, he has still managed to put out new music — something that is a feat in itself. On top of that, he recorded the whole thing both solo and with a live orchestra and big band, adding some backing instrumentals never heard before in Neil Young tracks. There are big band moments in songs and low violins in others, but all seem a little out of the blue for a veteran of the folk scene.
Storytone is certainly not Young’s best album, but he experiments with his sound in new ways, giving listeners a new take on the old, brooding vocals that made him famous. Unfortunately, his work with the big band simply falls flat. “Say Hello to Chicago” is a jazzy piece that sounds like a poor imitation of Sinatra rather than a bona fide Young original. It starts with trumpets that could’ve been directly stolen from “Theme from New York, New York,” and dives into a Chicago-style piece that works until Young lends his vocals to the track. Young’s iconic voice has been the center of a great deal of hits over the years, from solo tracks “Old Man” and “Heart of Gold” to Buffalo Springfield originals like “For What It’s Worth,” but they don’t fit the jazzy backings laid down in “Say Hello To Chicago.”
The orchestra too has issues, despite being arranged by Michael Bearden and Chris Walden, industry veterans who have worked with Lady Gaga and Michael Buble respectively, among others. One critic from Pitchfork called the arrangement “hollow, gilding the songs without adding any thoughtful counterpoint.” The orchestra plays, but adds nothing to Young’s music, and overall, it subtracts from his iconic voice.
It is refreshing though, to hear the deluxe version of the album, which features solo renditions of each song. They are slow, soft and heartfelt and feel much more in line with Young’s musical stylings. Armed only with a piano or guitar, each track is quiet and earnest, throwing back to an earlier sound listeners of Neil Young will be much more inclined to love. Suddenly “Say Hello to Chicago” feels much more familiar through Young’s voice. The big jazzy tune is now a soft, reflective piece on Young’s last visit to Chicago. The stripping of the orchestra forces a much more intimate interpretation of each song, and it truly brings out the best in Neil Young. There is something comforting in the dark, beaten voice Young has presented throughout the years, and it feels good to still hear him creating music in the same way.
Neil Young will always be a legend of folk music, but his experiments in composition on Storytone do not accent his vocal style and ultimately subtract from his work.

For fourth generation Trojan  and star baseball player Nigel Nootbaar, expressing his gratitude to his roots is not difficult.

The recently signed Baltimore Oriole spends his weekends at Beach City Baseball Academy in his hometown of El Segundo, California, sharing his love for the sport with students at the same batting cages he once frequented as a kid.
His primary duty is to teach the weekly special needs camp that Beach City Baseball offers for free to families in the area, an initiative of owner Richard Murad who said he was addressing a need he saw in the baseball community. Murad speaks warmly of Nootbaar, saying the the Trojan baseball star has become so popular with the kids that many of them request him as a coach.
“Not everybody can do special needs. It takes a person that is authentic and really enjoys what they’re doing, and it definitely makes him a perfect fit,” Murad said. “He’s the real deal.”
Nootbaar currently devotes about four hours each weekend to coaching young students and hopes to continue for as long as he is in the area, he wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. He brings enthusiasm and perspective to the programs at Beach City Baseball, carrying the passion for baseball to the next generation of players.
“I always loved learning from older guys who were still playing the game so I figured kids would like to learn from me,” said Nootbaar, who approached Beach City Baseball with the proposition of helping out. “The best part about this so far is seeing some of those kids with the biggest smile on their face[s] after they hit a ball hard.”
The program, which consists of about 35 students at a time, is a hit in the El Segundo community, which Murad describes as very supportive of baseball. Some of the students have been with Beach City Baseball since the age of three, he said, and have shown immense growth through their time there. A few of the special needs students have moved into the general leagues at the Academy, and Murad says a bystander would never believe some of the kids have any special needs based on their performances. But the most important thing to Murad is the personal development of each student.
“A lot of the kids gain self-confidence because they are actually achieving something that they haven’t before,” he said.
The standout Trojan attributes finding his own love for baseball to the time spent at the Beach City Baseball batting cages, a love he has translated to great success.
The Trojans have not sent a player to the Orioles since Damon Buford in 1990. Nootbaar, who just finished up his first professional season on the Aberdeen Ironbirds, an Orioles minor league affiliate, was a key player for the Trojans during his time here, making 43 appearances and 11 career starts. During his sophomore year, he struck out 12 batters, making the game against Fresno State a career high for Nootbaar.
Since then, he has appeared nine times in the past USC season, and was the starting pitcher twice with a 2.81 ERA.
To both Nootbaar and Murad, the most important thing is the cultivation of a positive atmosphere and promotion of a love of the sport.
The Beach City Baseball Academy is a baseball club that, despite name changes, has long been a part of the El Segundo community. Murad said they strive to maintain an old world baseball club atmosphere, like that of clubs in the 1940s and 1950s, while also making it as welcoming as possible.
“I feel that enjoying what you do is the best way to get better. I want the kids to be begging their parents to drive them to BCBA because they love being in that environment,” Nootbaar said.

Take one look at The Theory of Everything trailer, and it’s difficult not to tear up. After all, it appears to be a remarkable story that will undoubtedly pull at every heartstring, anguish and frailty inside the human body. It’s the common cliché story of love conquering all — even physicist Stephen Hawking’s dreadful motor neuron disease.
Firsthand account · The story is adapted from Traveling to Infinity, the autobiography of Stephen Hawking’s first wife Jane, played in the film by Felicity Jones. This point of view offers a unique perspective into the immense strain that the onset of ALS in Hawking caused on their relationship. – Photo courtesy of Focus Features Media
 
Directed by James Marsh, the biopic, which was adapted from Jane Hawking’s autobiography Traveling to Infinity, tells the story of Hawking and his first wife Jane (played by Felicity Jones) first meeting in 1963 and instantly falling in love. Though The Theory of Everything is an entertaining and entrancing film, it does not appear to be the inspiring and cliché love story the trailer claims it to be — rather, it is the struggle of one man to surpass his two years of predicted survival and the sort of short-lived love affair that ultimately dies out as the disease progresses.
The film begins with Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) as a graduate student studying cosmology at Cambridge University, struggling to develop a thesis. At a party, he meets the lovely Jane, a churchgoer studying the arts — the opposite of his science-driven self. As they begin their adorable and awkward relationship, Hawking begins showing early signs of his motor-neuron disease. It continuously progresses until he suffers an awful fall that lands him in the hospital. At the hospital, a doctor frankly tells him that he has motor neuron disease and predicts Hawking has two years left to live.
Despite Hawking’s attempt to hide away, Jane comes to the rescue. Determined to fight the disease, she marries Hawking, and continues what seems the “greatest love affair of all time.” Despite Jane’s initial determination and passion, however, Hawking becomes a chore to her, and the “passionate love” goes missing along with Jane’s burning tenacity. The love and passion die even before the actual disease begins to cause struggles in the relationship. Nevertheless, the couple bizarrely continues having children — despite the lack of any appearance of intimacy between them.
Moreover, in spite of how tired Jane is, she never breaks down emotionally, never loses her cool and never really panics about the circumstances — which makes her character feel unreal in the ease with which she handles the situation. At one point, Jane does reach out to her mother, but the support she receives is the simple suggestion that Jane join the church choir (advice which Jane takes). It almost feels as though Jane’s struggles are reduced to simple stress and annoyance.
Though Jane’s emotions are subdued, the struggles of Hawking are portrayed with astonishing range. Redmayne, who up until this point had played secondary roles in My Week with Marilyn and Les Miserables, proves himself as the true and utter star of the film. Not only can he successfully act, but he also literally embodies Hawking — both the nerdy and awkward physicist and the disease-stricken and physically impaired survivor. Physically, he perfectly shows the bodily changes the disease cause to Hawking’s character, including the slurred speaking, jutting out chin, and hunched over shoulders.
Redmayne also displays the internal struggles that Hawking faced, while the disease took over his body. In one powerful scene, Hawking tries to climb the stairs, but when he can’t, he is stuck making eye contact with his baby son. The son looks down upon Hawking, who at his lowest point cannot do anything to help himself.
Though Hawking’s relationship with Jane fades quickly, his relationships with others are what help carry the film. His friends at Cambridge provide male companions who care for Hawking, and literally carry him where he needs to go. They also provide comedy on multiple occasions — including when his friend places Hawking in the lap of a large statue momentarily while he moves Hawking’s wheelchair up steps. Hawking’s relationship with his eventual red-head bombshell caretaker also brings light to the story, revealing Hawking’s great sense of humor, even during the darkest times of his journey.
The Theory of Everything is an inspirational and heartfelt story, but not for the same reasons the trailer makes it out to seem. Though Jane’s love and determination initially drives the story, it is Hawking’s brilliance and light-heartedness that allows him to overcome his disease. It’s not the traditional love story, but it is a sort of charming and unique conclusion. The relationship ends, but the camaraderie between a once-young and passionate couple lasts. The story breaks the usual cliché that the couple must end up together for a happily ever after ending. In reality though, perhaps there is a different kind of ending to life — an ending that is perfect in its imperfection.

This week, the Supreme Court took up Zivotofsky v. Kerry, a complex case with political and diplomatic ramifications that has been through the court circuits before. In this particular situation, the ultimate decision on foreign policy should rest with the State Department, the issuer of passports and conductor of diplomatic relations across the world on behalf the of the United States.
The case centers around 12-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky, an American who was born in Jerusalem in 2002 and whose parents wish for Israel to be listed as his place of birth on his passport, rather than Jerusalem. According to a 2002 law signed by then-President George W. Bush, citizens born in Jerusalem can have Israel listed as their place of birth on their passports, if they so requested. The stipulation was a provision in a larger appropriations bill, and the Bush administration opposed that specific provision, as has the subsequent Obama administration. The issue at play is whether allowing Israel to be listed, thereby recognizing Jerusalem as within the territory of Israel, would indicate a marked shift in U.S. foreign policy. Regardless of the side the justices take, the larger question is which branch of government has the jurisdiction to rule on foreign policy.
The question brought to the Supreme Court by the Zivotofsky case should not be decided in terms of dictating policy. The duty of the Supreme Court should be to rule on matters of constitutionality and not appraise a law as good or bad policy.
In 2002, Congress supported passports reading “Israel” for citizens born in Jerusalem, but the State Department has continually objected to such a policy. Recognizing Jerusalem as part of Israel would have far-reaching diplomatic and political implications that would compromise the United States as a mediator and broker of peace within the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The State Department’s stance remains cognizant of the current “tinderbox” situation in Jerusalem, as Associate Justice Elena Kagan called it.
Many, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, argue that allowing Israel on passports would not necessarily mark a departure in American policy. On the contrary, such a policy would imply the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as part of the state of Israel, which is disputed by Palestinians.
Justice Kennedy argued for a compromise, inserting a statement indicating that the birthplace designation is not a declaration “that Jerusalem is within the borders of the state of Israel.” Passports, however, are documents authorized and issued by the State Department of the U.S. government, and a birthplace designation would indicate a certain diplomatic recognition of Israel’s control of Jerusalem.
The Supreme Court, as it traditionally does, should rule the question brought by the case with a narrowly tailored approach. It also needs to remain aware that its ruling not only affects the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also implicates the role and power of each branch of government. If the Court rules that Congress was within its reach with regard to the 2002 law, then in what instances does the State Department trump Congress and vice versa? In addition, if the Supreme Court itself rules on the matter, it would make it culpable of the unconstitutionality it claims of Congress.
The Zivotofsky v. Kerry case requires a multi-faceted approach by the Supreme Court that carefully steers it toward ruling that the power of foreign policy resides with the executive branch in the State Department. The broader real-world ramifications are important to consider as well because of the unique circumstances surrounding the issue.

Street art posters labeling U.S. Representative Maxine Waters as a “poverty pimp” sparked controversy in the communities of California’s 43rd District impacted by the signs. The posters are reminiscent of works by street artists Robbie Conal and Shepard Fairey. Though the “poverty pimp” posters make a strong statement, they blur the line between street art and political campaign tactics. Artists should not be penalized for addressing political themes in their works; street art can be directly connected to political campaigns without losing value as works of art.
Marissa Renteria | Daily Trojan
Despite their political message, the “poverty pimp” posters seem to fit better into the realm of street art than campaign tools. Graffiti is generally thought of as unwarranted vandalizing of public spaces, while the term “street art” does not carry such a negative connotation. According to Examiner.com, “Street art is basically art created by any artist not sanctioned by a gallery or commissioning body of some sort.”
In addition, as Examiner.com added, the purpose behind this type of art is to comment on “socially relevant themes, or in other words, a protest of some sort,” which explains why authorities tend to respond so negatively to street art. Last month, council members of Clacton-on-Sea, England removed a racially charged Banksy mural. The pseudonymous yet renowned artist is known for creating works that address sensitive topics, such as war, surveillance and poor working conditions, often making political statements about them.
In order to prevent similarly provocative art pieces, some counties have laws prohibiting non-commissioned street art. The Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs has a lengthy application and review process for all street murals. According to the Department of Cultural Affairs’ website, this process includes an application, community meeting, initial review and final review of the proposed work. Though the Department of Cultural Affairs aims to promote creativity in the community, this process undermines the spontaneity and uncensored expression typified by street art.
Freedom of expression allows individuals to critique institutions that shouldn’t confine artistic works. Even seemingly mild forms of censorship, such as the prohibition of street art, can greatly infringe upon freedoms. Artistic expression is the mark of a democratic society and should be respected. Without the guarantee of uncensored expression, society is unable to acknowledge alternate perspectives and risks becoming close-minded. Even though politically tinged street art might make the viewer uncomfortable, it provokes thought and challenges the viewer to reconsider their perspective. It is essential in creating a dialogue about sensitive topics. Street art is accessible. The large scale and public location of street art makes it the ideal medium to address issues that concern the community. Instead of being confined to art institutions, it confronts the viewer in his or her own environment. It is site-specific: The message depends on the context in which it is created and cannot be moved. This makes street art all the more powerful — it sends a direct message that resonates with the immediate community.
Despite ongoing legal battles over graffiti and its presence in urban space, artists should not be restricted by harsh backlash from the community. Street art is a valuable expression of freedom and raises sensitive issues that impact surrounding communities. If artistic production is based solely on political correctness, then confrontational works, including the murals by Los Angeles artist Free Humanity, would not have been possible. Though these works are bound to ruffle some feathers, their potential to create much-needed dialogue outweighs their confrontational nature.
Uninhibited art can expose injustices and promote social change. Street art is a wholly democratic form of expression; it is not exclusive to galleries or museums, but meant for collective viewing. Last month, anonymous L.A. street artist Skid Robot painted murals depicting the dreams and aspirations of the homeless. In a statement to the Huffington Post, Robot said, “I’m drawing attention to a human being who more often than not is looked at as nonexistent.”
Though street art might not address the most comfortable topics, it is a testament to freedom of expression and allows artists to raise thought-provoking questions in public spaces. Art should not be restricted to institutions or bounded by topical constraints; instead, it should be the voice in and of the community.
Just as the “poverty pimp” posters demonstrate, street art can have a political tone without losing its value as a work of art. It can incite action and create a public dialogue in ways other forms of expression cannot. Whether stenciled on the streets or pasted on the side of a building, the value of street art is more than just a can of spray paint.

It all began one afternoon while I was in my dorm. The Breeders’ Cup, the world championships of horse racing, was coming to Santa Anita Park in Arcadia on Oct. 31-Nov. 1, and I thought it would be an interesting experience covering the event for the Daily Trojan. I contacted Aubrey, one of the Daily Trojan sports editors, and told her about my idea. Aubrey liked the idea and found where I could sign up for a press credential to cover the Breeders’ Cup. After filling out some paperwork and a few phone calls later, I was approved to receive a press credential for the biggest annual weekend of horse racing.
The main reason I was interested in covering the Breeders’ Cup was to see California Chrome, a horse who had won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness earlier in the year, race in the Breeders’ Cup Classic.
I was born and raised in Yuba City, California, which is where one of California Chrome’s owners, Perry Martin, resides. Though I’m a big sports fan and have ridden horses before, I rarely watched horse racing. When I heard about California Chrome’s connection to Yuba City, I decided to watch the Kentucky Derby to root for California Chrome. After watching California Chrome take victory, I became an instant fan of his and suddenly became interested in horse racing. After hearing about California Chrome’s backstory about how his sire and dam had mediocre racing records and how California Chrome was bred for only $10,000, I had even more reason to root for him when he ran in and won the Preakness a few weeks later.
When California Chrome attempted to win the Belmont Stakes and horse racing’s first Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978, Yuba City held a huge celebration and viewing party for the race on Plumas Street in the business district. When I heard that this was going to happen, I made sure I was there. Despite the triple digit temperatures in Yuba City that day, fans of California Chrome came from far and wide to attend the event. Plumas Street was lined with music and business booths, and two big monitors were set up at the ends of Plumas Street that showed the race live. Unfortunately, California Chrome finished fourth in the Belmont Stakes. Nevertheless, I loved being there and seeing my hometown come together to celebrate the accomplishments of an athlete who had a connection to Yuba City. Thus, when I received approval for a press credential, I was filled with joy that I was finally was going to see the horse that impacted me, and my entire hometown of Yuba City, race live.
On Friday, I raced off to Santa Anita Park after getting out of my last class at 1pm. I was able to get to the race course and find my way to the auxiliary press box before the first Breeders’ Cup race started. There was food and water for the press members and the view of the track was stunning. The difficult thing about the press box was that the view during races was not the greatest. Since the press box was situated towards the end of the front stretch, I couldn’t tell what horses were leading and by how much when they were coming to the finish line, so I had to look up at the video boards to find out that information. This, in my opinion, took away the unique advantage of being at the races live. However, at the beginning of races, the press had the best seat in the house as the horses would run very close to our section at top speeds.
The first Breeders’ Cup race, the Juvenile Turf, did not disappoint. The Juvenile Turf, a mile race ran on turf that is restricted to two-year-old male horses, was won by Hootenanny, a colt that had a 2-1-1 record in four races coming into the event. Hootenanny, who started the race from post five with 6-1 odds, stayed in the top three for most of the race before making his final charge to the front late and winning by ¾ of a length over second place finisher Luck of the Kitten.
Next up was the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile, which is open to three-year-olds and up. 2013’s victor and odds-on favorite, Goldencents, was slated to retire from racing following the race regardless of the outcome. Goldencents had a lifetime record of six wins and seven runner-up finishes in his 17 career races coming into the Dirt Mile. As if it was meant to be, Goldencents brought home the victory in the Dirt Mile for the second year in a row, despite fierce competition from horses Vicar’s in Trouble and Tapiture during the eight furlong race. Goldencents and Vicar’s in Trouble created a huge gap between themselves and the rest of the field in the early going. However, as the race went on, Vicar’s in Trouble faded and Tapiture began to make his move towards the front. It would not be enough as Goldencents held Tapiture off just long enough to get the win by 1 ¼ lengths.
Then came the Juvenile Fillies Turf, which was restricted to two-year-old female horses. Lady Eli, who had won in both of her only career starts, showed why she was the odds-on favorite in dominant fashion. Starting inside from post four, Lady Eli won the mile race in 1:33.41, which was 1.38 seconds faster than Hootenanny’s winning time in the Juvenile Turf. On top of that, Lady Eli’s time was the fastest ever recorded in Juvenile Fillies Turf. Lady Eli ultimately won by 2 ¾ lengths over second place finisher Sunset Glow.
The final Breeders’ Cup event on the Friday card was the Breeders’ Cup Distaff. The Distaff is limited to female horses three years old and older. Untapable, who sported seven wins in ten career races, became the third horse of the day to be the odds-on favorite in a Breeders’ Cup race and win. Untapable raced in mid-pack for most of the race, then turned on the jets near the end to take over the lead from Iotapa. Untapable would win by 1 ¼ lengths over second place finisher Don’t Tell Sophia, who beat Iotapa to the finish line by a nose.
After the first day of racing had ended, I walked to the stables to try and find California Chrome since the stables were a place media members were allowed. I was surprised that there were not too many extra people in the stable area, especially since media were allowed access. Knowing California Chrome’s barn and stall number, I was able to find him fairly quickly. It was great to see him in person, especially since not many people were around other than guards watching over all the barns to ensure the protection of all the race horses. This made the meeting more private and special to me. Although I was not allowed to surpass a white post about eight feet or so in front of California Chrome’s stall, I was still able to get a good view of Chrome and even was able to take a few pictures before darkness settled and I had to head back to campus.
The next morning, I awoke to my alarm clock at 4:30 a.m. and was off to Santa Anita Park once again a little after 5 a.m. I was hoping to get to see California Chrome one last time before he went off to race later that day in the Classic. I arrived at the track around 5:30 a.m. and walked around the paddock area for a few minutes, thinking it was too early to go into the stables. I was able to get some pictures of the famous statues near the paddock and also read about some of the greatest moments in Breeders’ Cup history that were posted in the same area. I also paid a visit to Clocker’s Corner near the beginning of the front stretch and it was actually fairly busy for that time of the morning.
A little after 6 a.m., I finally made my way to California Chrome’s stall. The walk was quite muddy due to all the rain that had fallen, so I had to be careful not to get my formal clothes dirty. When I arrived, California Chrome’s trainers Art and Alan Sherman were there and so was Raul Rodriguez, California Chrome’s groom. I exchanged a few words with Art about how I came from Yuba City and how California Chrome had impacted both me and Yuba City. In fact, with every member from the California Chrome camp I talked to, I mentioned my Yuba City connection. An NBC Sports crew then showed up and took an interview with Art Sherman. A short time later, California Chrome’s main photographer, Kathleen Waldvogel, arrived to see California Chrome. While she was there, she gave me some helpful suggestions on how I could become a better sports photographer based on how she captures her photographs. I continued to stay at California Chrome’s stall area for quite some time, taking some more photographs and just being happy that I could see this special, personable, beautiful, hometown race horse so up close.
When I finally left California Chrome’s stall area, I journeyed down to Clocker’s Corner once again, hoping to find California Chrome’s owners. While I was not able to find Martin, I did find California Chrome’s other owner, Topaz Lake, Nevada native Steve Coburn. I talked to Coburn briefly and someone also volunteered to take our picture together. After that encounter, I spent some time talking to one of the Breeders’ Cup volunteers before heading to the auxiliary press box for another great day of racing.
The first Breeders’ Cup race of the day, the 1 1/16 mille Juvenile Fillies, produced perhaps the biggest upset of the entire weekend. Take Charge Brandi, a horse that had only one career win and 61.70-1 odds of winning, shocked everyone by winning the race in 1:41.95 by ½ a length over Top Decile, who was one of the favorites. The finish was so unexpected that, in terms of betting, a correct $1 superfecta bet paid $97,620.
The Filly and Mare Turf (1 ¼ miles) saw another upset, albeit it was not anywhere near the extent of what happened in the Juvenile Fillies race. Dayatthespa, at 11-2 odds, led the entire race and brought home her 11th career victory. Dayatthespa finished 1 ¼ lengths ahead of second place finisher Stephanie’s Kitten. The favorite, Dank, who was 2013 champion of the race, finished in fourth 1 ¾ lengths back.
The first Breeders’ Cup race of the day that had an odds-on favorite win was the Filly and Mare Sprint. Judy the Beauty, last year’s Breeders’ Cup Filly and Mare Sprint runner-up, held off second place finisher Better Lucky down the stretch to win by a head in the seven furlong race. Judy the Beauty’s winning time was 1:21.92. The victory also gave jockey Mike Smith his unprecedented 21st Breeders’ Cup victory.
The Turf Sprint was ran at an even shorter distance of approximately 6 ½ furlongs. Three-year-old colt Bobby’s Kitten, who started from post six, made an unbelievable run in the home stretch, going from dead last to first on the outside and stealing the win from the odds-on favorite No Nay Never by half a length in a time of 1:12.73. The victory was Bobby’s Kitten’s fifth career win in 11 starts.
Next up was the Juvenile. Two race competitors, Calculator and early favorite American Pharaoh, were scratched from the event due to injuries. With American Pharaoh out, Carpe Diem became the odds-on favorite to win. However, like most of the Breeders’ Cup races that had already been ran on Saturday, the favorite did not come home as the victor. Instead, Texas Red reached the finish line first in the 1 1/16 mile race with a time of 1:41.91. Texas Red had stayed at the back of the pack in the early part of the race, but then charged to the front, took the lead on the outside, and increased his lead in the final few hundred yards to win by an impressive 6 ½ lengths over Carpe Diem, who placed second. The win was only the second of Texas Red’s young career and his first Grade 1 stakes victory.
In the $3 million Turf, five-year-old Main Sequence shined bright in the final portion of the race, taking the lead from Flintshire and winning the 12 furlong event with a time of 2:24.91. Flintshire finished second half a length back and Telescope, the odds-on favorite, finished outside the top three in fourth place 2 ¼ lengths behind Main Sequence. The win was Main Sequence’s fourth straight in a Grade 1 race since he came to trainer Graham Motion’s barn earlier in 2014 after being based in Great Britain.
The shortest race of the Breeders’ Cup was the Sprint, which was only 6 furlongs (3/4 of a mile) in length. Work All Week, who came into the race with 11 wins in 14 starts, stayed near the front for the majority of the race before making his move late and finishing half a length ahead of the 2013 Sprint winner Secret Circle. The win was the first Grade 1 victory for both Work All Week and his trainer Roger Brueggemann. In addition, with the win, Work All Week remains undefeated on dirt in his career.
The final race before the Classic was the Mile. At 30-1 odds, Karakontie rallied late to beat second place finisher Anodin and third place finisher Trade Storm. The Mile was the first race on U.S. soil for Karakontie, who was bred in Japan and had only been previously raced in France. Karakontie had previously raced in eight events and won four of them.
With 12 races down, there was only one left to go: the famous Breeders’ Cup Classic. At the start, Bayern, who started in post position seven, immediately darted to his left. This caused the horses on the inside, including the undefeated Shared Belief, to bump into each other and fall back. Bayern was able to take the lead early and he would never give it up, despite stiff competition from Toast of New York and California Chrome (both of whom started outside of Bayern) down the stretch. In fact, Toast of New York finished second by a nose and California Chrome finished third by a neck to Bayern. At the conclusion of the race, there was a stewards’ inquiry regarding Bayern’s actions at the start of the race and if his actions ultimately changed the outcome of the race. After a few intense minutes, the stewards decided to not disqualify Bayern and gave him the win, citing that the interference did not affect the outcome of the race. With Bayern’s victory, Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert earned his first Breeders’ Cup Classic victory. The call was controversial and met with criticism by some horse racing fans claiming that the interference indeed hindered the chances of Shared Belief and the other horses on the inside.
After the stewards released their final verdict on the interference, I walked out of Santa Anita Park planning to head home. However, I stopped in the parking lot and decided to go see California Chrome one last time, in case I never saw him in person again. When I arrived at California Chrome’s stable, there were more people than usual around California Chrome’s stall. California Chrome had not made his way back to his stall yet, so I talked to some of California Chrome’s camp members. Art Sherman was leaving, so I said my final good-bye and thank you to him on his training of California Chrome. I also talked to some people who were working for HRTV about internship opportunities at the network. As the conversations continued around the stall area, and with the white post that separated the press from the horses removed, I asked and was allowed to go past where that white post would have been. To me, that was a great feeling. Moments later, everyone had to move over as California Chrome made his way into the barn area. Despite having just run a hard race, California Chrome was calm and looked great. Members of the California Chrome camp and myself expressed how proud and happy we were with California Chrome’s performance. A few minutes later, I made my way out of the stables and headed back to USC from Santa Anita Park for the final time.
The Breeders’ Cup weekend was one I will never forget. I can’t thank the Daily Trojan and the Breeders’ Cup enough for this opportunity I received. I met so many great people, especially the members of the California Chrome camp, during my two days at Santa Anita Park. I loved telling people about my Yuba City connection to California Chrome and I was also able to give out some of my sports reporting business cards to potential contacts that I met, like the NBC Sports and HRTV crews. The fact I was able to see California Chrome on three different occasions, up close, almost privately, and for long periods of time was simply amazing for me. California Chrome, in my opinion, is a hero in Yuba City and I felt so proud to be a Yuba City citizen that day when the city held a festival for California Chrome. For every sport and team I became interested in watching and covering, there was a catalyst. To me, California Chrome was the catalyst for my interest in horse racing. I’m so glad that California Chrome’s owners have decided to race him next year as a four-year-old and I can’t wait to continue following California Chrome’s journey. Who knows, maybe if he races in the Breeders’ Cup at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky next year, I just may do this experience all over again.
I’m so jealous. Sounds like a great experience to meet this magnificent animal in person. He sounds as cool as he looks on TV. If i could spend an hour with him and any of the crew though I would choose Raul. His love and caring for that horse is amazing. He handles him with such care and you can tell Chrome loves it.
Chrome is a gift from God!
So – what was it like being close to Chrome?  Did he communicate with you?  Is he as stunning in person as he is in pictures?  Tell us more about the backstage action, the people, how it felt!  Thanks!
It’s great that you want to hear more!  Being close to Chrome was amazing, considering that most fans can’t even get that close to him or see him only on the track.  He is a very big horse, bigger than I expected.  He is as beautiful in person as he is in pictures, but you see Chrome in a different way when you see him with your own eyes (for a lack of a better description).  I took plenty of pictures of Chrome and, looking back at them, I don’t think they serve justice to to seeing Chrome in person.  Chrome didn’t show his face much Friday night, often moving his head back and forth between the corners of his stall (It could have been food, but I don’t know).  I tried calling his name a few times, but no avail. Saturday was when I got better looks at Chrome, as he put his head outside his stall most of the time.  The security guard on duty told me about how Chrome grabbed onto his shirt, but it was with good intention.  Chrome didn’t pull any of that when I was there.  I described Chrome as personable in my article because you can sense Chrome has a funny and great personality, even when he was just there remaining calm.  It is hard to put into words, but you could tell Chrome was enjoying himself.  Chrome’s groom, Raul, put a big heating pad on Chrome’s back on Saturday morning when I was there (Chrome had been out on the track earlier that morning).  It was interesting because Chrome seemed to know just by sound who was coming and with what whenever Raul went to the stall by turning his head and holding it there until Raul arrived.  Art, Steve, and the rest of Chrome’s camp are very nice people, are easy to talk to, and are very knowledgeable.  They don’t act different when they are off camera.  You can tell they love Chrome and they were all in high spirits even after the close loss on Saturday.  I really do hope I get to see them and Chrome again.  If you have anymore specific questions, don’t be afraid to ask!
Thank you!  Maybe for people who haven’t been to the track you could describe what it’s like being at a race!  Especially if you were close to the horses:)
Honestly this was my first ever attending a horse race live, so I can only speak about Santa Anita in particular.  In my article, I describe my views during the races.  The track is so big that you really do have to look at the video board or have binoculars to really have an idea of all the small things that are going on, especially when the horses are on the backstretch.  Where I was at, we had a fantastic up close view of the horses when they came into the first turn.  During races, the fans would start yelling and really getting into it for their horses when the horses came into the home stretch, but otherwise stayed fairly quiet for most of the race.  The grandstands are massive.  In fact, I believe the amount of spectators on Saturday was over 61,000.  The track itself was kept groomed as the races went on and the grass at Santa Anita, in all areas that have it, is simply stunning.  Inside the grandstand areas, there were big rooms filled with betting booths.  Some booths had big bet minimums.  They had a small press room and they also had some different eateries.  Outside the grandstands around the entrance, there was the paddock and a few statues.  Very beautiful area for sure to just walk around.  The stables were on the left outskirts of the track and the road to get to them, and roads inside the stables, were all dirt, but that’s expected.  I can understand why the Breeders’ Cup has been ran at Santa Anita the last few years and why it is slated for another return in 2016: it is a great race track!
It certainly looked stunning on TV.
I’m a life-long horse fan and never tire of their beauty and their intensity and the incredible energy when they race.  Of course riding a T-bred is something else – 
Well keep on writing and I’m so happy for you that you got to see Chrome in person; I am a big fan of this horse and get a kick out of his owners.
Take care and thank you!
