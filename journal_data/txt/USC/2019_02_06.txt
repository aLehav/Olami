On Super Bowl Sunday, I held a party at my house. Of the attendees, roughly 90 percent were rooting for the Rams. As the game went on, this contingency grew quiet. By the fourth quarter, most had left the party altogether, leaving behind a small number of vocal Patriots supporters. 
Once the Rams’ chances looked dim, their “fans” — at least those in my household — bailed on them and didn’t turn back. In the weeks leading up to the game, I heard several L.A. natives hyping themselves up for a possible parade from Downtown to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. However, they weren’t prepared for how they would handle a potential loss, let alone a loss in which the Rams showed less fight than a high sloth. And so, they left. 
This example may or may not be indicative of the Rams’ fanbase as a whole, but the Patriots’ striking home-field advantage in Atlanta paints a similar picture (media outlets reported an 80-to-20 ratio of Patriots fans to Rams fans in Mercedes-Benz Stadium). Despite the Rams’ dream Super Bowl run and breakneck style of play, the team has yet to win over its city in a meaningful way. Unfortunately for the franchise, a dull, listless performance at the sport’s grandest stage is unlikely to inspire the loyalty it desperately needs — especially with a new stadium set to open in Inglewood in 2020. 
In many ways, the team’s unseasoned play in Super Bowl LIII reflected its underdeveloped fanbase. At 24 years old, quarterback Jared Goff looked downright befuddled by the Patriots’ creative pressures and disguised coverages. He was slow to make reads and quick to panic when plays fell apart. It didn’t help that the Patriots shut down the Rams’ league-leading rushing attack, taking away play action passes — Goff’s greatest strength by a mile. Running back Todd Gurley’s versatile skill-set was barely utilized. When he did manage to get his hands on the ball, however, he struggled to find open turf and averaged 3.5 yards per touch. 
Afterward, head coach Sean McVay rightfully admitted he was out-coached by living legend Bill Belichick. All season, McVay has been the face of a new generation of offensive innovation. Yet, by confusing Goff and successfully neutralizing one-man wrecking crew Aaron Donald on Sunday, it was Belichick who remained one step ahead of the young whipper-snapper. 
So, where do the Rams go from here? Luckily, the team shouldn’t expect a drastic drop-off in 2019. The Rams will likely lose some starters, such as defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, safety Lamarcus Joyner and tackle Andrew Whitworth due to cap restrictions, age or both. But the team’s true selling point — the exciting young core of Goff, Gurley, Donald and receiver Brandin Cooks — is likely to remain intact. The team’s biggest salary cap challenge will come when Goff is due for a contract extension in 2020, which could blow the Rams’ cap flexibility to shreds, resulting in less available room for stars. 
Unlike the Patriots, who build through the draft and regularly cut veterans when they get too expensive, the Rams took a shortcut to reach the Super Bowl. They added a bevy of high-profile free agents in the off-season, giving the franchise short-term success but long-term instability. In order for Los Angeles to become consistent winners, the team will need to take a page out of the Patriots’ playbook and combine stars with late-round diamonds in the rough. It’s unlikely the Rams will be capable of fielding as many former first-round picks and Pro-Bowlers as it did this season. 
The Rams reached a Super Bowl in just their third season since relocating from St. Louis, but it’s clear that their strength as a team is still a work in progress. McVay needs to improve his in-game adjustments, Goff needs to grow more comfortable under pressure and Gurley needs to be given the ball more, especially in creative ways (the Rams never threw a screen to Gurley on Sunday, despite the Patriots’ near-constant penetration). Looming cap restraints mean these improvements will need to happen sooner rather than later. 
If the Rams do regress from this season — which is not only possible but likely — it’s fair to wonder how their fans will respond. USC’s attendance at football games dropped drastically in 2018 during its first losing season in nearly 20 years, and the Trojans didn’t pack up and leave for a generation, like the Rams infamously did. How would Rams fans respond to a four- or five-win drop-off from last season? 
The coming weeks, months and years will test whether McVay’s Rams will become a long-term contender or a flash in the pan. But more so than that, time will test Angelenos’ patience for a team still in its infancy in the city. 
McVay, Goff and the fan base will either grow together or grow apart. Winning will be the main decider.

The No. 14 USC men’s volleyball team will host Grand Canyon University in their first match of Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play Thursday.
Grand Canyon, who holds a 7-5 record, entered the MPSF conference just last year. The Trojans who are 6-4 and .500 in their series against GCU, having lost to the Antelopes twice last season.
Freshman outside hitter Christian Janke leads the Antelopes on offense with 175 kills this season and sophomore setter Onur Cukur leads in assists with 276 on the season. Both Janke and senior middle blocker Alex Shmelev will be players to watch on the baseline with 14 and 16 service aces, respectively.
GCU freshman libero Cole Udall anchors the back row defense with 79 digs on the season, while Shmelev and junior middle blocker Caleb Blazer have put up 48 and 41 total respective blocks in the Antelopes’ 12 games so far. 
For the Trojans, senior outside hitters Ryan Moss and Jack Wyett lead the team in kills and boast .374 and .321 hitting percentages, respectively.
Wyett and senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso bring the heat on serves and will be key players against the Antelopes with nine service aces each. Senior libero Matt Douglas and Moss anchor the back row defense with 39 and 40 digs each. Moss, with 25 blocks this season, is also a staple in the front row for the Trojans.  
Wyett said the matchup will be key for the Trojans to start conference play right. 
“[We are] mentally preparing going into conference play and using our first match, if successful, as a catalyst for more success this season,” Wyett said.
The Trojans scout every team they play and watch plenty of film on their opponents before all matches, but said the only thing they can control is their contribution to the game. 
“We really want to put the emphasis on us and what we’re doing on our side,” Moss said. 
Ahead of the game, the Trojans  said they are looking forward to some rest and recovery, as it will be their only match this week. 
“It’s our first conference play match, so we’re going to be doing a lot of game play,” Wyett said. “We’re going to study the tendencies of those guys, because that’s a good team.”
Despite being nationally ranked this week and last, the Trojans haven’t lost sight of their focus on continuing their improvement. 
“At the end of the day, being ranked doesn’t have too much of an impact on what happens to the rest of the season,” Wyett said. “Everyone makes the playoffs, and we haven’t even started conference play. We didn’t look too far into it. All that really matters is playoffs.”
Thursday’s match against GCU will tip off at 7 p.m. at  Galen Center.

Coming off their first road win of conference play, the Trojans are motivated to remain undefeated at home in Pac-12 play en route to achieving their ultimate goal. 
“We have a lot of motivation,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’re trying to win the Pac-12 regular season.”
Standing in the Trojans’ path to home perfection is the staggering Utah team. After picking up four straight wins against some of the conference’s bottom feeders, the Utes have since dropped two tough single-digits losses at home. 
In fact, the season as a whole has been tough for head coach Larry Krystkowiak and his bunch.
Following a six-win season in his inaugural campaign as head coach, Krystkowiak has coached the Utes to five straight 20-win seasons and five consecutive top-four Pac-12 finishes. However, barring some unexpected change in play, the 2018-19 season may be the end of Utah’s recent streaks of success.
One of the main reasons behind Utah’s mediocrity this season is its poor defense. For the first time in Krystkowiak’s tenure, Utah is allowing its opponents to score over 70 points a game. In fact, the Utes are having their worst defensive season in three decades statistically, as their 73.4 nightly allowed points is the highest since the 1978-79 season.
On the offensive side, Utah has followed that same theme of mediocrity, as it continues to fall in the middle of the Pac-12 in scoring. Despite a mediocre ranking in total scoring, the Utes are statistically the best shooting team in the conference.
“They have four or five guys on the court that can make threes, so we have to guard the 3-point line,” Enfield said. 
Furthermore, the Trojans have to watch out for two major elements of Utah’s offense — senior point guard Sedrick Barefield and four-star freshman forward Timmy Allen.
As expected by Utah fans, Allen slightly struggled at the start of the season, averaging just 9.1 points in non-conference play; however, against Pac-12 competitors, the freshman has upped his nightly scoring to 14.4 points. 
Allen has become one of the rare offensive weapons for the Utes, and has also asserted himself as a scorer who needs to be accounted for before tipoff. 
However, it’s clear who Utah’s main go-to guy is. Coming into the matchup with an average of slightly over 16 points an outing, senior guard Sedrick Barefield is currently Pac-12’s seventh-highest scorer and is the conference’s highest-scoring point guard. 
Scoring against the Trojans won’t be easy for Barefield, as he will match up with one of the best guard on-ball defenders in the conference in redshirt junior point guard Derryck Thornton. With 29 steals on the season, Thornton is eighth in the conference.
“I’m going to try to limit [Barefield’s] scoring,” Thornton said. “He’s a great player, but I’ve [played] against them my whole life.”
When Thornton isn’t disrupting the offense of the opposing team, he is making the lives and scoring opportunities of his teammates easier, evident in his five assists per game. The Trojans have focused on sharing the ball this season: Enfield’s bunch currently leads the Pac-12 in team assists with 16.5 per game.
“Our players are doing a great job of sharing the ball, making the extra pass and creating for their teammates,” Enfield said. 
In their recent 93-84 commanding victory over Washington State, the Trojans led with 19 assists and reached their highest scoring output since mid-November. Throughout the game, USC rode the hot hands of senior forward Bennie Boatwright and junior guard Jonah Mathews, in addition to the dominating interior presence of breakout star junior forward Nick Rakocevic. 
Expect the Trojans to continue to follow the same leaders as they square off against the Utes at Galen Center at 8 p.m. on Wednesday.

The USC women’s lacrosse team returns for their seventh season this weekend. After a successful 2018 season, the Trojans are hard at work to show that they are back and stronger than ever. To start, the Trojans will play Hofstra University  on Saturday.  
As USC begins its long-awaited season, it looks to take home the 2019 NCAA trophy. 
“We are focusing on the details, the basics,” sophomore midfielder Emily Stallings said. “We are hammering in on the small things so they become natural in the game. Deemer Class is one of our new assistant [coaches], and he had brought so much knowledge and energy from the men’s game. We are working more motions that are seen in the men’s game and making things more exciting.”
Last year, the Trojans saw Stanford in the Pac-12 women’s lacrosse tournament with the goal of bringing home the program’s first NCAA championship title. Ultimately, the Stanford matchup ended USC’s three-game win streak and lost the Trojans’ automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, finishing the year with a 10-8 overall record.
Now, the Trojans will compete against Hofstra University, who finished last season 8-9 overall. To ensure success, the Trojans are adding new plays and learning more offensive strategies. 
“This season, we are focusing on ourselves and what we can all do individually and collectively to guarantee our success,” Stallings said. “We don’t want to relive that feeling and disappointment, so that is a huge motivation for us.”  
Look for junior midfielder Kerrigan Miller, last year’s Pac-12 Midfielder of the Year, to lead the Trojans’ attack. She led the team in scoring last year with 36 goals and 13 assists. 
Last year, the Trojans failed to capitalize on the draw, ending the season with just 207 controls to 202 losses. The team must improve in this statistical category to take the next step this year.
The departure of Gussie Johns opens up the goal for sophomore goalie Riley Hertford to take the position. Although Hertford appeared in a mere three games, the two-time Under Armour All-American shows promise, allowing only one goal while racking up five saves in the games she played.  
“Everyone is stepping up,” Stallings said. “Someone else always steps up after we lose key players. Our two goalies are both filling their roles with ease, the defense works hard to protect the goalies and the offense works hard to ride the ball in transitions to make things easier for the defense. The team is a unit, and as a whole, we all work together to fill any void.”
The Trojans should feel confident about the continuity of the team this year. Aside from the four graduating seniors the team let go, the 28 returning players have an established sense of camaraderie. As the first game approaches, every player’s motivation this season is centering around working together to keep consistency in the roster stronger to give the Trojans an advantage come game time. 
The team said there will never be an easy game in their schedule. USC is facing many of the same competitors they took on last year, like No. 1 Boston College and Stanford University, which the Trojans hope to best in their rematch. 
USC will host Hofstra Saturday at noon at McAlister Field.

When Netflix released “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo” Jan. 1, they were probably expecting most of the audience to consist of Kondo’s already-extant fanbase: middle-aged, stay-at-home moms with too much time on their hands and millennials flirting with minimalism, inspired by the pristine white “#hygge” homes. 
Instead, the show became something of an overnight sensation. Kondo’s message of “sparking joy” spread like wildfire. Some Twitter users fawned over her warm, spritely mannerisms, while others dismissed her as a foreign hack. Her most vocal dissidents were elevated, then just as quickly shut down. Thinkpieces pivoted from reviewing the show to covering the aftermath as Goodwills became laden with the neglected spoils of thousands of closets. Then, the memes appeared.  
For those newly introduced to the KonMari method and interested in learning more, I’d highly recommend the 2014 book that launched Kondo into the public eye, capturing the hearts and homes of many — “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering.” 
The basic outline of the method is laid out in the Netflix show, but “Life-Changing Magic” explains the decluttering process more in-depth, separating it into two steps: discarding and storing. Kondo systematically explains exactly how each category of clothing, books, papers and komono (miscellaneous items) should be addressed, while peppering in amusing anecdotes about her career as a personal tidying consultant. 
But this column is not exactly a review of the book. This is more, I suppose, an airing of grievances. 
Full disclosure: Last semester, I worked as an intern for KonMari Media, the home and lifestyle brand founded by Kondo. I was given full access to her social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and was I tasked with monitoring her community of fans and devotees, dubbed “Konverts.” I also met Kondo while helping out behind the scenes with a photoshoot. She is just as tiny, gracious and charming as she appears on-screen, and I would gladly lay down my life for her.  
I’m heartened to see how many people are hopping aboard the KonMari train, as evidenced by the fact that all 110 ebook copies of “Life-Changing Magic” at the Los Angeles Public Library are currently out on loans. But the deeper I wade into the discourse, the more apparent it is that many people have not read her writing, and therefore either have a faulty perception of her principles or willfully misunderstand her advice.  
Kondo is not trying to get you to give up your acne cream just because it doesn’t spark joy. She advises you to thank utilitarian items that are mundane yet necessary for the benefits they bring to your life: “Thank you, acne cream, for helping me keep my skin clear and healthy.” She wants you to address the perfume samples, the inkless pens, the receipts shoved in a bottom drawer — all the detritus that accumulates as a byproduct of our existence.  
For some reason, people get very prickly about their personal possessions, as if Kondo has personally put them and their lifestyles on blast. They seem to think that she plans to make off with their vast collection of travel-sized shampoos in the dead of night, a tidying vigilante. Writers have already fired off plenty of thinkpieces, so I’m sure I don’t need to get into the covert racism people deploy when their hackles are raised by the mere suggestion that hey, maybe you don’t need to hold onto your French 101 textbooks from college. 
If all 10,000 books you own spark joy for you, then Kondo wants you to keep them. Her method is not a prescriptivist one that forces everyone to conform to a fixed structure of what she believes the ideal clutter-free life looks like. Instead, it is flexible and adaptable, modified to accommodate the whimsies and foibles of each individual. You are allowed to pick and choose which aspects to implement. She acknowledges that her method won’t work for everyone, but it works for her, and it seems to work for her legion of Konverts. 
Above all, I hope people remember that Kondo is a person, not a magical fairy godmother who can spawn a total transformation with the wave of a wand. She is not advocating for everyone to adopt a monk’s asceticism. She does not have nefarious designs upon your tchotkes. She’s too busy granting interviews, writing her new book and enjoying her life with her husband and their two roly-poly daughters. She’s clearly achieved her ideal lifestyle. All she wants to do is help others achieve theirs.

A Beverly Hills experience with an affordable South L.A. twist: That’s what Danny and Bobby Kronfli, brothers and co-owners of Bacari West Adams, aim to provide at their  classy tapas-centered restaurant and bar near USC. Along with co-owner and executive chef Lior Hillel, the duo has grown their business from one South L.A. restaurant 11 years ago to what is a rapidly growing enterprise today. 
They now own five locations throughout Los Angeles, with restaurants in Glendale and Playa del Rey. Recently, their University Park location on South Union Avenue was rebranded from Bacaro LA to Bacari West Adams, a testament to how far the business has come: Bacaro is the singular form of “wine bar” in Italian, while Bacari is the plural form. Along with its new name, Bacari West Adams was recently renovated in order to revitalize the owners’ original goals for bringing a reasonably priced, upscale restaurant to the area and to give it “new energy and a fresh face.”
While they ended up finding success as partners, Danny and Bobby, both USC alumni, took different paths to get there.
When Danny describes his USC experience, he immediately recalls doing many business projects on restaurants and bars. This was something he had always wanted to do, but he chose to follow a career path in advertising upon graduating, only to return to the restaurant business soon after.  
“When I was 24 years old, I took the leap and decided to buy an existing restaurant that was here by campus and renovate it a little bit and open it,” Danny said.
On the other hand, Bobby — who graduated from USC with a degree in music industry — was just a sophomore when his brother opened Bacaro LA. He helped out by working shifts.
“At the time, my roommate was an aspiring chef,” Bobby said. “So long story short, my roommate and I decided to start running a restaurant out of our apartment. It was called Paladar, and we did it once a week for two years all the way until we graduated. So I kind of found my passion for restaurants doing that.” 
This passion led Bobby to join Danny at Bacaro after he graduated in 2011.
The Kronfli brothers grew up in the Pasadena area and went to high school just a few blocks away from the location where Bacaro LA would later open.
Their familiarity with the neighborhood  presented them with a way to solve a problem they had seen and experienced firsthand as students in the area. 
“We thought that the area was lacking a good restaurant for students to go to, so that also was a main reason why we came into this restaurant,” Danny said. “Because around campus there’s always just fast food and stuff like that.”
Bobby emphasized that although they serve a wide range of customers, Bacari West Adams really is “student-centric.” He aims to serve things that are off the beaten path.
“[We want] to provide fine dining at a really approachable price point at $8 to $9 a dish,” Bobby said.
Their childhood experiences run deeper into their restaurant decisions than merely the choice of location. 
“Our family comes from the Middle East, so [our childhood] was very family oriented — big family, big meals, very hospitable,” Danny said. “We grew up that way, and it’s something that we really enjoy doing. We really enjoy serving people and making sure they have a good time and have really great food.”
Walking in, the hospitality that Danny and Bobby built the restaurant around is immediately tangible. The dining room is dimly lit and just small enough to provide customers with a sense of comfort right when they step in from the busy street traffic.
Demonstrating the nature of the restaurant that he created, Danny recounted the story of a couple who first went on a blind date at the restaurant, then got engaged at the same table and finally, had their wedding catered by Bacari. 
“We kind of became a part of their relationship,” Danny said. “It was all part of the whole experience that we provided for them. I love just making sure that everybody is having a great time and that we can leave an impression on them.”
Bobby reflected that it was easier for the brothers to maintain this kind of environment when they had only the one restaurant. 
“When we were here every day, on the floor every day, serving you, running your food, making your drinks, doing everything … we had complete control over your experience from the minute you walked in to the minute you left,” Bobby said.
 Bobby and Danny still try to maintain this environment, but now have to do it remotely from a main office. However, with the help of their restaurant team members, the brothers are able to sustain the winning ambiance they created 11 years ago. 
Hillel, the executive chef, is a big contributor to the preservation of Bacari’s close-knit culture. Hillel was born and raised in Israel, where he served as a foot solider in the military.
When he was discharged in 2004, Hillel followed his passion for cooking and attended culinary school in Israel. He moved to the United States in 2005 and studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Pasadena before relocating to New York City to work at a Michelin three-star restaurant. He moved back to Los Angeles in 2008 and joined Bacaro LA within the first months of its grand opening. 
Hillel seeks to merge the Kronflis’ Lebanese background and culture with his own Israeli background when creating dishes. 
“I try to bring a bit of my background which is Israeli, and Robert and Danny’s background is Lebanese … and we have the same palette of flavors,” Hillel said. “For me, it’s important to have a fresh impact on each dish.” 
A popular Bacari dish — the grilled chicken breast — epitomizes this ideal. The chicken breast is poached in water and grilled, giving it a soft texture that can be cut cleanly through with a dinner knife. The chicken is set atop a fried risotto cake and then covered with sauce with lemon, butter, caper and jalapeños that adds a tart, fresh flavor to the dish.
When creating such intricate dishes, Hillel has four elements in mind: freshness, texture, color and flavor.
“When I’m designing a dish, I can taste it in my head, and then the process of implementing and trying to create that dish from my head and my flavors to the plate is the fun part,” Hillel said.
For the Kronflis and Hillel,  having fun seems to be an important part of their jobs. In fact, this mindset has been instrumental in their careers, and the Kronflis said they only wish that they had embodied it more while at USC.
When asked about what they would tell their college selves, Bobby replied with a laugh. 
“Have more beer,” he said. “That’s the honest answer.”
Danny agreed, adding that he and his brother both worked too much in college. 
“I would probably tell myself to be a little more social and make more friends,” Danny said. “I was more focused on other things, school and worrying about what I was going to do once I was done, so I would probably tell myself to loosen up a little.”
But now, they are enjoying the fruits of their labor. 
“We find ourselves happy every morning waking up to come to work,” Bobby said. “So as long as that keeps happening, we’ll keep doing it.”

USC students are buzzing about this week’s Undergraduate Student Government presidential and senatorial elections. Posters line Trousdale Parkway, campaign graphics inundate Facebook feeds and campaign candidates attempt to follow as much of the student body as possible on Instagram.
When USG senators Michaela Murphy and Meagan Lane announced an unopposed campaign, two more tickets — Trenton Stone and Mahin Tahsin, and Maxwell Brandon and Grayson Adler — joined the race as write-ins shortly after. Many were worried about the tardiness of their announcements and whether that reflected possible irresponsibility on behalf of the candidates. There is no difference in the legitimacy of write-in or normal tickets. Their names still appear on the ballot, and they are still acknowledged on the USG elections website as official candidates. 
The ability to run as a write-in ticket is essential to the USG voting process, as students should never have to settle for only one option for leadership. 
Presidential tickets who announce their intent to run by USG’s deadline have almost a month to prepare for their campaign to launch — this lends a considerable advantage. By deciding to run despite the major time setback, the two write-in tickets demonstrate their dedication to serving the student body. Campaigning is tougher for write-in candidates — have to prove their dedication and tenacity by catching up to other tickets.
Write-in tickets are uncommon and not recommended because of the limited time allotted to planning and running the campaign. Running for office is extremely demanding — it entails canvassing, marketing, speeches and debates. However,  both write-in tickets have worked to raise their visibility, gaining traction comparable to the initially announced campaign. 
Write-in candidates have proven to be just as qualified as regularly announced tickets in past years at USC. There has never been a time when an elected write-in candidate was unable to enact changes that they had hoped for at the start of their terms, according to the USG elected official records. Much of the framework for these leadership positions are handed over by the last people in office and USG is working to make transitions smoother.
Most of the student body does not know the difference between write-in and normal tickets — the main problem is voter turnout, not whether the presidential and vice presidential candidates are write-ins. In the past four years, less than 25 percent of the student body has participated in USG elections. Rather than worrying whether the write-in candidates are qualified, students should instead work to raise engagement among their peers. They should engage in more conversations about candidate platforms and should vote. 
These write-ins are not new faces in USG or the USC political landscape, as both tickets have already been involved in past events and initiatives that affect the entire student body. Both tickets are legitimate, regardless of their position on the political spectrum and their late intent to run. Their status as write-in candidates is irrelevant in light of all they have accomplished so far, and should not be relevant to this race.

2018 was a great year for Awkwafina. The New York- born Asian American rapper, comedian and actress triple threat recently starred in two blockbuster movies. She became the first Asian woman to host “Saturday Night Live” since Lucy Liu did in 2000. She’s the friend that everyone wants to have — badass and funny as hell. She will also be one of the presenters at the 91st Academy Awards alongside “Crazy Rich Asians” co-star Constance Wu, both of whom were unceremoniously snubbed in 2019 Oscar nominations. 
2018 was a great year for all Asians in Hollywood, not just Awkwafina. “Crazy Rich Asians,” the only mainstream Hollywood movie to feature an all-Asian cast since “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993, proved a critical and commercial success. The feel-good romantic comedy illustrated that Asians could truly be a box-office draw. 
Alongside “Crazy Rich Asians” was “Searching,” a thriller drama starring Korean American lead John Cho, that also enjoyed both critical and commercial acclaim. Additionally, “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” — a Netflix film starring Lana Condor —  saw viral success, adding to the Asian victories in film in 2018. 
Asian Americans no longer seem like an anomaly in Hollywood. These three successful films were released within months of one another, each surpassing expectations and receiving widespread acclaim. Award nominations soon followed and “Crazy Rich Asians” was doing admirably. Everything was going the right way.
Taking awards out of the conversation, “Crazy Rich Asians” has already made history for Asian representation. However, awards ceremonies provide a kind of representation that cannot be achieved with just mainstream success. Awards bestow an element of prestige upon a movie, cementing them into the mainstays of cinematic history. 
There are two types of people in this world: Those who pretend to give Oscars acceptance speeches in the shower and those who are liars. After suffering through 20 years of watching white actor after white actor give those very acceptance speeches I’ve facetiously imagined myself giving, I’ve always wondered when it would come time for an Asian American to give one. 
I had a glimpse of such a moment during the Golden Globes, when Sandra Oh accepted her award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series for “Killing Eve.” Seeing her in tears thanking her parents made me cry almost instinctively; it was unsurprising when I saw almost all my Asian friends share posts announcing Oh’s victory on Facebook. 
The message we felt was unanimous — we did it. Her victory felt like a victory for all of us, as if her win was an invitation for all of us to join her seat at the table. Heading into the Academy Awards, I was excited to see “Crazy Rich Asians” on the nominations list. “This is it,” I thought. I was finally going to see people who looked like me recognized for their achievements on Hollywood’s biggest night. Only, I wouldn’t. 
“Crazy Rich Asians” failed to receive a single nomination, not even for less prominent categories — costume, makeup or design. While I was disappointed and surprised to see the shutout at first, I quickly realized that I was foolish for being surprised at all. After all, one look at the Wikipedia page for “List of Asian Academy Award winners and nominees” and you would see a laughably small list of Asians nominated in the top five categories. In fact, there have only ever been two Asians nominated in the Best Actor or Actress categories, and both have been white-passing — one even actively denied she had any sort of Asian ancestry. 
Now, I’m not saying that “Crazy Rich Asians” deserved to sweep the Oscars and collect nomination after nomination. But there is also no reason why it shouldn’t have. There seems to be myriad convenient excuses as to why “Crazy Rich Asians” didn’t perform well in the Academy Award nominations — a major one being that romantic comedies traditionally don’t do well in this awards show to begin with. However, that doesn’t stop other comedies from picking up nominations: “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” received one for Best Original Screenplay. Additionally, the Academy seems to be tossing tradition out the window. “Black Panther” picked up seven nominations, including one for Best Picture, which is usually unheard of for a blockbuster superhero movie. Such a feat is a phenomenal achievement, especially for a trailblazing movie like “Black Panther.” If the film was able to garner so many the nominations, why couldn’t “Crazy Rich Asians?” 
I don’t really know if there is an answer to that question. Maybe to the Hollywood elite, “Crazy Rich Asians” just wasn’t good enough to warrant a nomination. Maybe they thought that by nominating “Black Panther,” they had fulfilled their diversity quota and no longer needed to nominate any other movie featuring other minorities. Or maybe, they thought that instead of giving an exceptional, bamboo ceiling-shattering movie the recognition it rightfully deserves, they could just invite a few of its stars to present some awards as a consolation prize. 
I can almost hear the voices of the 84 percent white, 69 percent male members of the Academy in my ears saying, “Nice try, Asians. Solid effort. Better luck next time!”

The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative hosted a diverse panel of Grammy-nominated musicians and accomplished women in the industry, as part of “A Celebration of Women in Music” Tuesday. The panelists discussed the lack of representation of women in the music industry and what steps can be taken to achieve gender parity.
The most recent Annenberg Inclusion Initiative study, conducted earlier this week, demonstrated that 73 percent of female artists are women of color and there was an increase in female Grammy nominees. However, there is still work to be done, said professor Stacy Smith, founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.
The panel included Tina Tchen, head of the Inclusion Task Force at the Recording Academy; Ann Mincieli, a recording engineer and studio coordinator for Alicia Keys and founder of Jungle City Studios; country music singer-songwriter Cam; record producer and DJ TOKiMONSTA; and singer-songwriter Aluna Francis, who is part of the electronic music duo AlunaGeorge. Smith and her research associate Katherine Pieper co-moderated the event. 
Jody Gerson, the global chairman and CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group, co-founded She is the Music, a nonprofit dedicated to inclusion initiatives for women in the music industry in response to a study published by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative last year. The study found that across 700 of the most popular songs from 2012-2018, less than 22 percent of the artists behind them were women.
The organization has three major initiatives to increase female representation in the music industry.
“We built a global online database, so the industry can connect and create with more women,” Gerson said. “We’ve successfully launched a global, all-female songwriting series, and this year we will unveil a mentorship program to develop future generations of women.” 
Grammy-nominated artists Cam and TOKiMONSTA shared their respective struggles in the fields of country and electronic music.
Cam said that within her genre, she still faces backlash when speaking out against gender imbalance issues. TOKiMONSTA said that her peers often underestimate her talents as a female electronic musician.
“In the realm that I am [in], which is electronic and urban music, it is very male-dominated,” TOKiMONSTA said. “It is almost to the point of misogyny, yet in this last year, I’ve seen a significant change.” 
While the statistics sparked “hunger” toward achieving gender equality in the industry, Francis said, the changes will take generations to be fully implemented. Tchen said women in all industries have faced discrimination for generations.
“We’re talking about overall culture,” Tchen said. “This isn’t just the music industry. This is everywhere that women for generations have not been able to advance, have been the victims of violence and harassment, have been kept down in so many different ways.” 
According to Tchen, one of the ways the Task Force implements change is by electing more women to its committees. Research affirms that more diverse groups make better decisions, Tchen said. She also said that increasing female representation could help protect women from sexual harassment in the workplace.
“We’ll never make progress unless we really confront [sexual harassment],” Tchen said. “Everyone deserves a safe place to … do their work, to make a living.”
Kristin Vartan, a graduate student studying specialized journalism, attended the event and said she learned more about the music industry and how it can foster an inclusive environment.
“I think it was pretty fruitful just because they brought women from almost every aspect of the industry,” Vartan said. “Anyone who wanted to hear from an artist or a producer or an engineer got that immersive experience.”

A coalition of boycotters has called on individuals, companies and USC to cut ties with the Terranea Resort in Palos Verdes after eight women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct during their employment at the luxury hotel since 2017.
On the Terranea Resort website, USC Sports Properties, a division of FOX Sports Media Group and Home Team Sports, is listed as an official partner. USC Athletics announced in 2012 that the Terranea Resort is the official resort of the University’s athletic programs. 
Additionally, the Keck School of Medicine hosts programming and events at the resort. The school most recently held a radiology conference at the hotel last October.
“When a resolution is reached, we will determine if the resort continues to meet our standards,” USC Athletics wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
The lawsuit against the hotel was filed in 2017 after Sandra Pezqueda, a former dishwasher and chef’s assistant at the resort, publicly detailed her experiences with repeated incidents of alleged assault. The Guardian first reported on Terranea staffers’ allegations of sexual harassment last October, and the allegations gained national attention after TIME Magazine’s Person of the Year issue named Pezqueda one of the “Silence Breakers” — some of the women who ignited the #MeToo movement by speaking out. 
The lawsuit was settled in May 2018 and the hotel was dismissed as a party to the suit.
“USC Athletics is aware of allegations involving the Terranea Resort and will continue to monitor it closely,” USC Athletics wrote. “USC values and upholds its commitment to environments free from discrimination and harassment. We have a zero tolerance policy for that kind of behavior on our campuses and require the same commitment from our partners.” 
UNITE HERE Local 11, a union representing over 30,000 workers in the Southern California region, leads the #MeTooTerranea boycott against the hotel and its partner organizations. The union has partnered with advocacy groups including California NOW, Feminist Majority and Ultraviolet.
“At the end of the day, I feel that USC’s response is not the right response,” said Maria Hernandez, communications director for UNITE HERE Local 11. “They don’t really understand what is really happening … [It] seems like they are choosing their business and their events over what is happening at this hotel, and in my [opinion], it feels like they just don’t care.”
Since Pezqueda’s allegation, seven more women who worked at Terranea have come forward with similar allegations of misconduct and harassment against the resort. Following backlash from the boycotters, Vox Media’s Code Conference and AOL’s MAKERS Conference, which were held annually at the Terranea, were relocated after facing backlash from boycotters. 
Daniel Jimenez, an organizer for UNITE HERE Local 11, said he hopes USC will also reevaluate its partnership with the Terranea Resort. 
“The values of [USC] have to be aligned with [its] actions,” Jimenez said. “It is really important that [USC] stands with women, they do the right thing and they stop doing business with the Terranea until the resort becomes a place where women are treated with dignity and respect.” 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the Terranea Resort denied the allegations made against the hotel and its staff. 
“The lawsuit has no merit and is part of a smear campaign by UNITE HERE Local 11 designed to force Terranea to unionize and forgo a democratic process despite a lack of interest by most of its employees in having such representation,” the statement said. “The overwhelming majority of our guests and customers recognize the union’s agenda.” 
Representatives from UNITE HERE Local 11 hope the lawsuit will force Terranea Resort to change its alleged culture of sexual assault and misconduct among staff and guests.
“With these women coming forward, it is creating a culture of ‘Oh my God, this happened to you, this happened to me, too,’” Hernandez said. “Instead of the resort choosing to stand up with them and choosing to … take the issue seriously, again they are choosing not to — choosing not to comment and saying that people are liars.” 
Keck Media Relations did not respond in time for publication.

The Interactive Media and Games Division of the School of Cinematic Arts launched its first ever public online course Jan. 29 as part of its ongoing effort to make game production more accessible. The game design course, titled “Unity + USC Games Unlocked: Design and Publish Your Original Game,” was co-developed with video game company Unity Technologies.
USC and Unity partnered in developing “Unlocked” to teach intermediate game designers of all backgrounds how to make a game from start to finish. The eight-week course is publicly available for purchase online.
“Unity and USC … share a goal, which is democratizing game development, making it something that is available to all kinds of people,” said Margaret Moser, an assistant professor of game development who teaches an in-person course on Unity. “This is meant to be a way in. By offering it to anyone on the internet, our hope is to bring in more diverse people so that anyone who wants to make a game can feel like they can do it.” 
Moser worked with Unity to develop curriculum that reflected USC’s standards while also aiming to improve Unity’s user retention.
“Unity came to us with a problem,” Moser said. “A lot of people are very excited to start using Unity, people are very excited about making their own games, they’ll do a few tutorials and feel ready. They set off to make their own games, and then they run into issues making those games.” 
According to Moser, the new course offers guidance specifically designed for students to walk away with a small, finished game. 
“Most people who get into making games have some super cool game idea that they’ve been sitting on for years … and they just don’t understand how hard it is to make those games,” Moser said. “What we’re trying to do in the course is give people constraints, a kind of walled garden, where they take something that is small, makeable and doable, that they can pull off.” 
The online class includes tangible, professional tools for students to produce realistically-sized games and to stay on track with development. Students can expect to spend three to four hours on weekly assignments for eight weeks. The open-ended format offers non-traditional students a place to learn beginning-to-end game design for $79. 
While Unity already offers educational content, Interactive Media and Games Division assistant director Sam Roberts said USC brings a unique perspective to the program’s development. 
“We don’t want to duplicate the experience of someone going here online,” Roberts said. “But we thought that we could serve [a] gap in the space by developing a new course that also helps students in the same way that our intermediate course does, but in a more open-ended format where they can do their own work.” 
According to Unity, the new course also offers a focus on design, beyond technical game creation skills. 
“We recognized that many learners have access to introductory Unity education but often lack access to intermediate and advanced instruction in game design and production,” Jessica Lindl, head of global education at Unity Technologies, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We hope the course raises the bar for online game development courses with project-based assignments in game concepting, design, architecture, project planning and testing.” 
USC was one of the first universities to integrate Unity into its coursework, Roberts said. It has used the engine in its curriculum for 10 years. 
“We really believe in Unity here,” he said. “It’s one of the things that‘s made such a wide space for independent development and for students who don’t come from strictly computer science backgrounds to develop games, which is a big part of what we do.”

When filmmaker Caroline Friend decided she would write and direct a short film about a real World War II photographer and resistance fighter, she knew it would be an extraordinarily important story to tell.
She didn’t realize just how important, however, until she met the photographer, Faye Schulman, herself. In February 2017, Friend went to Schulman’s home and told her she would create a short film about a portion of her life, titled “Under Darkness.”
Friend, a School of Cinematic Arts alumna, was awarded the Horizon Award for up-and-coming female directors for her film at the Sundance Film Festival, where she screened a two-minute scene to a crowd of over 100 people.
Friend also wanted to tell a story she felt was overlooked, and she hopes the film inspires people to learn more about the Holocaust and the Jewish partisans who resisted the Nazis in irregular military groups during the war.
“[Faye] wanted her story to be told, and she wanted audiences to learn about everything she went through and her family went through and millions of other Jewish people went through in World War II,” Friend said. “It’s even hard to explain what it meant to me, but it made it all the more important to make the movie as accurate as I could and as impactful as I could.” 
When Friend screened the scene, which depicts Nazi soldiers directing Faye to photograph them, she said the audience at Sundance was palpably tense. When the scene ended, a quote from Faye appeared on screen, explaining that there was a Jewish resistance during the Holocaust, and she had the pictures as proof. At this moment, Friend said audible gasps could be heard in the room.
“Under Darkness” was made possible by a Alfred P. Sloan Foundation production grant that funds student films related to science. Friend’s film shows Schulman not only taking photographs but developing them as well through a chemical process. 
As a student at USC, Friend produced and directed several films about war and won the Shoah Foundation’s Student Voices contest for a short documentary she directed about Holocaust survivor Helen Lewis. Having studied history, film and television production, Friend said she was often intrigued by the “resilience of the human spirit” during wartime.
Thomas Miller, a practice of cinema arts professor, served as Friend’s mentor while she worked on “Under Darkness.” He helped her reign in Schulman’s story and whittle the essential components down to a 20-minute film.
“[Schulman’s] story is important because sometimes we lose sight of the people that you don’t know were important in documenting our history,” Miller said. “It’s a really good film. [Caroline] should be really proud of herself.” 
Miller said he was impressed by Friend’s dedication to researching Schulman’s story -—she even traveled to interview her and gained permission to use Schulman’s photos after the credits of the film.
Kally Khourshid, who plays Schulman in the film, echoed this admiration for Friend’s attention to detail. Friend felt a responsibility to honor the accuracy of “this turbulent, dark time,” Khourshid said, especially since Schulman’s family entrusted Friend with her story.
“This was one of the most meaningful projects I’ve ever undertaken,” Khourshid said. “It’s a giant responsibility to be an actor and a lead in a film that is not only based in World War II but also asks you to step into the shoes of a real person that’s still alive.” 
When visiting then-97-year-old Schulman, Friend was able to see Faye’s photographs of herself and her brigade during the war, which she kept in an album almost like “family photos,” Friend said. Seeing these photos and talking with Schulman helped her understand and connect with her subject even further, she said.
“In that moment it just made me realize that this person actually went through all these experiences,” Friend said. “She has [the photos] in her life because they’re a part of her life.” 
Friend said she will submit the project to other film festivals across the country over the next year. USC will also host a screening of “Under Darkness” and other Sloan grant films on Feb. 11, where Friend will also appear on a Q&A panel.
“The experience making ‘Under Darkness’ was the most incredible experience of going to USC and … the opportunity to tell Faye’s story was absolutely life-changing,” Friend said. “This is the type of movie I want to make for the rest of my life.”
