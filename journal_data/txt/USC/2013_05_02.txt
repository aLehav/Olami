On April 3, Assistant Professor of International Relations Mai’a Keapuolani Davis Cross, who had traveled cross-country from her tenure track position at Colgate University to join USC in 2008, was told she would not be granted tenure.
Her position at the university will be terminated following the current academic year.
Tenure, as it is described in the university’s faculty handbook, is indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and society. For faculty, attaining tenure provides not only freedom of teaching and research, but economic security.
The process begins with the preparation of a dossier presenting evidence of a candidate’s fitness for tenure. Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs Beth Meyerowitz said candidates are put through an extensive and carefully vetted review process.
“It starts at the department level closest to the faculty member,” Meyerowitz told the Daily Trojan last October, when reporting for this story commenced. “Then it goes through the Dean’s office and then through the University Committee on Academic Promotions and Tenure  and then finally to the Provost and the President.”
The dossier includes letters from both internal and external peer review sources.
“We seek outside letters from experts around the country about the impact that their work has had in their field,” Meyerowitz said.
According to a letter dated April 9, 2012, from then-Dornsife Dean Howard Gillman, Cross’s denial of tenure was because of a lack of discipline-wide enthusiasm of her scholarly contributions.
Marvin E. Krakow, Cross’ attorney, who shared Gillman’s letter with the Daily Trojan, said the denial of her tenure came as a surprise.
“Professor Cross’ evaluations uniformly were outstanding or outstanding plus,” Krakow said in an interview. “She was recommended by the department for tenure. She was also recommended by the faculty.”
Laura Pulido, a tenured professor of American studies and ethnicity and founder of the Committee for Tenure Justice at USC, said she has serious concerns regarding the university’s tenure process.
“I’ve been here since 1993 and I’ve seen a lot of tenure cases come and go during that time,” Pulido told the Daily Trojan last November. “Over the last decade or so, it just seems to be a problem.”
In March 2011, Pulido presented her Tenure Bill of Rights to students and faculty in the hopes of convincing UCAPT to enact 13 points to make the tenure system more transparent.
One of the main issues addressed in the Tenure Bill of Rights is the lack of feedback regarding why an individual was denied tenure.
“You should be able to share that with a person since you’re determining their livelihood,” Pulido said. “It’s important to know how your peers view your work and where you can improve.”
In addition to Cross’ award-winning publications — including three books, four book chapters and eight journals — she received USC’s 2011 Steven B. Sample Teaching and Mentoring award, which is awarded to one junior faculty member annually.
Cross filed a protest of the tenure decision to UCAPT, requesting an informal resolution of her concerns. Cross’ grievance points out that her tenure application had the support of her department and faculty, but was denied after senior administration sought what she called unauthorized and improper input from scholars outside Cross’ discipline, a violation of USC’s normal procedures.
According to a hearing panel report addressed to USC President C. L. Max Nikias on December 12, 2012, Cross claimed that former Dean Gillman made improper contacts during the final stages of the tenure evaluation process, or “cold calls,” with improperly documented outside sources who lacked relevant knowledge of her work and area of concentration.
In addition to the procedural violation, Cross’ grievance included a lack of basis for a denial of tenure, failure to give serious consideration to the recommendations of the School of International Relations and the Faculty of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, breach of contract and improper and discriminatory conduct on the part of the university.
The faculty grievance panel found that “Dean Gillman’s phone calls to additional referees during the UCAPT review level lacked appropriate protocols resulting in a procedural defect that materially inhibited Professor Cross’ tenure review process.” The panel also recommended that Gillman’s “cold calls” documentation be removed from Cross’ dossier and that Cross’ application be re-evaluated. The panel found no other procedural defects.
In response to the alleged lack of basis for the denial of tenure, the university maintains that “Cross’ application for tenure and promotion process was conducted in a manner consistent with the UCAPT Manual and the Faculty Handbook.”
Cross, who is of Hawaiian and Asian descent, also protested the university’s alleged discriminatory employment practices by filing a federal discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Jan. 2, 2012, on the basis of race, gender and national origin.
Cross also alleged that the university’s procedures demonstrate a pattern of ethnic and gender discrimination.
“I am pursuing USC’s internal grievance process to correct the unfair damage to my career, and to help assure that women and minority candidates will have the same chance to earn tenure as do their white, male colleagues,” Cross said in a press release dated August 2012.
A report conducted by Cross and her colleague Professor Jane Junn, an expert on public and polling methods, found that of 55 junior faculty in the social sciences and humanities departments between 1998 and 2012, 92 percent of white men considered for tenure received it. Comparatively, 55 percent of women and professors from minority groups who worked in the same departments were awarded tenure during the same period.
But Nikias found limitations in Junn’s analysis, according to a Jan. 23, 2013 letter given to the Daily Trojan by Krakow.
“[Junn’s] memo shows some subjective choices: counting cases without a decision as ‘not awarded tenure,’ including dual appointments with other USC schools but excluding social scientists and humanists based in those schools, omitting some humanities departments, and encompassing an arbitrary period of 14 years,” Nikias wrote to Cross.
According to the UCAPT manual from March 2013, 86 percent of tenure-track, university-wide faculty who completed the UCAPT process were granted tenure between 2006-07 and 2011-12. The report also found that, university wide, the proportion of women receiving tenure was 1.2 percent higher than the rate for men.
National statistics from the American Association of University Professors in fall 2012 show that 76.8 percent of the university’s tenured faculty is white, compared to the 74 percent national average.
Comparatively, USC’s percentage of Latino tenured faculty is slightly less than the national average, with 3.1 percent versus 4.1 percent nationally. Black tenured professors make up 2.3 percent of the university’s tenured faculty compared to the national average of 5.5 percent. The university boasts an above-average percentage of Asian tenured faculty of 14.5 percent compared to the 8.6 percent average.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Vice Provost Martin Levine, the primary liaison to the Academic Senate, said past allegations of discrimination have been unfounded.
“Every few years, someone raises the question of possible discrimination in tenure statistics,” Levine said. “Each and every time, analysis of a multi-year period shows there are no statistically significant differences between the tenure success at USC of female and male faculty, or minority and non-minority faculty.”
Despite the allegations of tenure discriminations among minorities, Levine said that the university’s reputation speaks for itself.
“We are proud that government statistics show that USC is, and has been for years, tied for No. 1 as the most diverse faculty among the private research universities of the Association of American Universities,” Levine said.
Pulido, however, said there is limited data to support this.
“There have been times where people have asked for data on tenure by department, year, minority status and gender, and the university has refused to give us this data,” Pulido said. “What they say is that USC values its privacy. We have no way of checking their data or their methodology.”
Pulido said the statistics also cannot be taken seriously unless they are backed with hard data.
“If a faculty were to conduct a study without showing their data, it would be considered unscientific and would be rejected,” Pulido said.
Another tenure dispute was filed in 2010 by Jane Iwamura, an assistant professor of religion and American studies. A published author, Iwamura was also the recipient of the Albert S. Raubenheimer Award, USC College’s highest faculty honor. Iwamura said she received positive recommendations by both the Department of American Studies & Ethnicity as well as the Department of Religion.
After submitting her dossier in spring 2009, Iwamura said there was no way for her to know the progress of her case because of the lack of transparency in the evaluation process.
“There is more transparency in other schools where candidates can read the redacted letters,” Iwamura told the Daily Trojan last November. “USC’s system was much more of a black hole — you submit everything and that’s it.”
After the university informed her that she would not be considered for tenure, Iwamura decided to pursue the reconsideration process.
After reformatting her dossier to include her newly published book, Virtual Orientalism: Asian Religions and American Popular Culture, securing a second book deal and submitting the necessary materials, Iwamura submitted her reconsideration case in spring 2010.
However, Iwamura learned later in the spring that her reconsideration was unsuccessful. Despite the disappointment, Iwamura was most frustrated with the lack of feedback and transparency throughout the process.
“It takes years and years to build your dossier and this is a decision that not only has to do with your continued employment but also plays into your confidence as a scholar,” Iwamura said. “Having no kind of objective recourse was almost equally as frustrating.”
Levine, however, said this concern is based on a misunderstanding of USC’s tenure process.
“The provost’s decision memo always states the reason for each denial,” Levine said. “If a candidate wishes more detail, a second memo from the dean to the candidate explains the reasons at length. This has been our rule for many years.”
According to the UCAPT manual, denied tenure candidates have the opportunity to request a letter from the dean explaining the decision. When Iwamura requested a letter following her tenure denial, she said the responses were vague.
Looking forward, Pulido said that the university should have a more thorough discussion about tenure.
“It’s time to get serious about opening up the tenure process so that it’s more transparent and so there’s a greater level of accountability,” Pulido said.
University officials said that the manual of the tenure committee has been published for a decade in order to de-mystify the tenure criteria and process.
“The university’s tenure committee is a rotating group of outstanding scholars, educators and creative artists,” Levine said. “And their goal is to make USC even better.”
The Faculty Academic Committee did not respond to requests for interviews.
On April 3, Cross received a letter from Dornsife Dean Steve A. Kay, saying that after reconsideration, Cross would not be awarded tenure.
“UCAPT carefully reviewed the evidence presented in support of promotion with tenure, including the new evidence presented in your reconsideration dossier,” Kay said in the letter. “The provost has concluded that the record does not support a promotion with tenure.”
Krakow said the university must still address the institutional problems regarding discrimination against women and minorities.
“The Office of Equity and Diversity still has the issue that was presented to it as a result of Professor Cross’ grievance,” Krakow said.
Cross’ complaint with the EEOC is pending.
This is a terrible decision – three books!  And she doesn’t get tenure?  Are you kidding me.
Anything that tries to defend this decision is just ‘spin’.
Jack.. there is NOTHING wrong with hiring senio faculty.. that’s good.. best way to erase your reputation with tenue is just hire senior professors like so many oher schools do.
Mai’a Cross’s case is just one of the many dubious tenure denials in recent years at USC.   Many faculty, most of the women, have been denied even when strongly supported by their colleagues.  There will doubtless be more cases taken to the EEOC.  USC is getting an increasingly bad reputation in many fields as a terrible place to be a junior faculty member.  The university appears to be far more interesting in bolstering its reputation by buying senior faculty at the end of their careers.   
Why should the students care?  Putting aside that fact that discrimination is wrong, the junior faculty tend to be the ones most invested in their students, they actually care about the students they mentor and are usually more interested in their teaching.  Note that none of these traits are rewarded in the tenure process at USC.
Thank you for this very important piece of journalism.  This issue affects faculty and students way more than is generally known
“once heard President Nikias remark that sometimes he forgets he is leading a school and not a business.”
the golden age of schools and academic freedom were 50s and 60s.. since then universities have been pretty much run like corporations and USC is one of the most extreme exemples of that.. just look at who sits on the board of trustees and where the endowment money is being invested.
now as far as this situation goes it’s hard to say whether she deserves tenure or not, but the USC tenures process is HORRIBLE.  The president decides whether she gets tenure or not.. It’s even worse than that actually since at USC the president has no authority, he is a puppet of the Board of trustees.
Rest of the DT, please take note. I’m so happy to read something that doesn’t sound like it came straight out of a USC press release. Congrats to Yasmeen for applying such curiosity and rigor to her work. 
So, if Prof. Cross is as qualified as she seems to be, and if she had the support of her colleagues in the SIR, then why was her tenure denied? That Prof. Cross was renowned at SC for her teaching makes it that much worse to lose her. 
I’m very disappointed with the way the Nikias administration has put institutional goals and its own public image before the well being of its own community. Its opaque treatment of processes like the tenure decision and the new campus security policies suggest is sneaky, and it reveals that they know their leadership is not fulfilling the interests of its students, faculty, and the community that surrounds USC.
I once heard President Nikias remark that sometimes he forgets he is leading a school and not a business. Maybe it’s time for a reality check.
You need to look past all her claims and consider she just isn’t right for SC.   She has troublemaker written all over her.
How? Please elaborate!
We love you, Mia’a
I think it is incredible that this type of discrimination is occurring right here on campus and the University is making none of this public. Good article Yasmeen!
Jennifer… No discrimination has been proven, and in fact, the data demonstrates otherwise.  USC remains an incredibly diverse institution at all levels.  It’s a shame that people so often resort to cries of “discrimination” when things don’t pan out the way they want.  The EEOC is of course mandated to take all complaints seriously, but her complaint will almost certainly be dismissed after review.  We’ve become an entitlement society, and apparently academia is not immune.
Benjamin, while I agree that discrimination has not been proven, I’m not sure “the data demonstrates otherwise.” Junn and Cross’ analysis found that 81% of white junior faculty members—including men and women—were awarded tenure from 1998 to 2012. In contrast, only 48% of assistant professors of color were promoted to the status of associate professor with tenure. This sytematic discrepancy does not prove discrimination, but it does provide a compelling argument for greater transparency in the tenure process. The Chronicle of Higher Ed wrote an article about this case and describes Junn and Cross’ methodology here: http://chronicle.com/article/Tenure-Decisions-at-Southern/135754/

The Galen Center entered into a deal last week with Nederlander Concerts, a Los Angeles-based company that organizes concerts with venues, to increase the numbers of concerts the center can host.
Rock on· The Galen Center and Nederlander Concerts deal will lead to more concerts, along with sporting events, being held at the venue. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Galen Center, which opened in 2006, has hosted concerts in the past, most recently hosting a performance by Drake last May. Nederlander Concerts has organized concerts in venues such as the Greek Theatre, the Pantages Theatre and the Santa Barbara Bowl.
The Gibson Amphitheatre, one of Nederlander’s partner venues, will close in September. Nederlander CEO Alex Hodges said the closing meant finding a new indoor venue to replace the Gibson Amphitheatre.
“The Gibson Amphitheatre was one of the iconic venues in the 6,000-seat range in Los Angeles, and with that going away we saw a great opportunity,” Hodges said.
Hodges said the deal, which was finalized approximately three months ago, has been in the making for years.
“I thought of the idea a couple years ago and met with bodies on campus and did my first walk -through a couple of years ago,” Hodges said.
Senior Associate Athletic Director for Football J.K. McKay said the Galen Center was built with the idea of hosting outside events, particularly concerts.
The Galen Center, which is home to the university’s volleyball and basketball teams, has hosted non-sports events in the past. It was home to the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards two years ago. Most recently, the Los Angeles auditions for Fox’s The X-Factor took place there.
While the venue will be open to more entertainment and concert events, McKay said hosting sports events takes precedence.
“Our athletic teams come first, their dates take priority in all cases, as do their practice times,” McKay said. “We’re only going to do these events when they work in our schedule and they don’t disrupt our teams.”
Authorities from both Nederlander Concerts and the Galen Center said they hope to bring in performers that will appeal to students. McKay said students will also have first priority to purchase tickets.
“We absolutely want to attract students,” Hodges said. “[We want] students and alumni to have some activity on campus that’s new and contemporary with music artists and concerts. I think it’s good for everybody.”
Galen Center management will have control over approving or rejecting possible performers.
“We’d like to do more concerts because we think our students will like it and we’re going to try to bring in events that they’re interested in,” McKay said.
Some students said they are excited by the possibility of having more concerts near campus.
“It’ll be a great opportunity for USC students to experience more live music,” said Selena Ng, a freshman business administration major and music industry minor.
“It will certainly be more convenient because it’s right there,” said Rica Maestas, a freshman cognitive science major. “As far as will the concerts be better, I’m not sure. We’ll have to see.”
As an ‘SC alum, this is cool news, plus I can leave my car at home since the Expo Line stops right across the street! Rock On, SC!

A group of USC students, community members and local artists in Leimert Park are bringing the pay phone back into service — and hoping to build and strengthen communities in the process.
Annenberg Professor François Bar, Kaos Network owner Ben Caldwell and doctoral candidates Benjamin Stokes and Karl Baumann launched the Leimert Phone Company this spring as a part of the Annenberg Innovation Lab. The five-week participatory design project aims to transform the pay phone from an obsolete relic into a portal that connects residents and visitors to local culture and history. The school purchased the 14 pay phones for their project from eBay.
“Our goal is to help the community re-imagine its future,” said Stokes, who studies in Annenberg. “We see these pay phones as a means to deepen the cultural identity of the neighborhood, and a way to help re-brand the neighborhood and let people know where local stores and local artists are.”
The project focuses on designing prototypes for Leimert Park, a South Los Angeles neighborhood known by community members and USC students for its art and community-based culture.
The neighborhood shows promise for economic development and business growth, yet also faces significant pressures, including gentrification and displacement. According to Curbed Los Angeles, in the coming days there will be a decision on whether or not to build a Metro stop in Leimert Park off of the Crenshaw light-rail line.
Caldwell said the team chose the pay phone to help connect the arts with the people in the community because they recognized the significance of retaining cultural roots in light of economic development and changing neighborhood makeup.
“[The pay phones] offer a portal for communicating in communities,” Caldwell said.
Most of the existing conversation about connecting public space to that of the digital world has focused on ideas such as providing Wi-Fi in parks.
Stokes said the team focused on ideas that reflected the many, nuanced layers of the community, including cultural assets and economic fabric. The resulting prototypes were thus designed to emulate the neighborhood’s distinct character and promote community building.
“We wanted the phones to reflect the people [of Leimert Park] that were coming to our design workshops,” Stokes said.
For instance, the team crafted a prototype called Dial-A-Track, a pay phone that is meant to promote businesses and local artists on Crenshaw Corridor. The pay phone, which will be strategically placed near the Crenshaw businesses where the music is being made, will provide a preview of an unreleased track. If listeners enjoy the track, they will be able to have the track sent wirelessly, in seconds, to their cellular phones.
In addition to designing prototypes that fit the community, the team feels these prototypes can help shape the community’s future as well. Stokes said the pay phone should embody what the community wants its future to be about. For example, if the community would like to focus its future around the arts, the phone should have a focus on the arts.
“I think it is cool to try to reuse something that already exists for a forward looking identity of a place,” said Alison Spindler, a first-year master’s degree of planning student at Price School of Public Policy. “I am also glad that they were very context specific. Since Leimert Park is an artist community, I am glad they took this into consideration when designing their prototypes.”
The repurposed phones can also help revitalize and strengthen the community, as well as bring new individuals into the community through common interests.
“The phones can be used to bring more people into the neighborhood,” said Baumann, who studies at the School of Cinematic Arts. “They can funnel individuals toward local businesses to bring them into the community.”
And just as public space is open to everyone, the team wants these phones to be accessible and usable for everyone in the community.
“It is not just thinking about the people who have money, but also the people who are underserved,” Caldwell said.
Caldwell would like the technology to be a free portal that everyone can use, regardless of socioeconomic status.
A notable aspect of this project is that it is being co-designed with community leaders and local artists in Leimert Park. From a planning perspective, Spindler feels this is very important to ensure that community voices are considered in the decision-making process.
Though the five-week lab has concluded, the team looks to expand the project. Its next stop is the Allied Media Conference in Detroit, and the team plans to hold workshop and discuss their strategy for a pay-phone redesign with a national audience.
Baumann and Stokes said they hope the phones will eventually become part of a nationwide movement to redesign phones that help spur economic and community development.
Two prototype phones will be installed within Annenberg, which Stokes believes can be a source of renewed connectivity between the university and the community. Stokes said though he currently believes the university is disconnecting from the community, the project can bridge that ever-increasing gap.
“What is really exciting,” Stokes said, “is this can be a place of ongoing conversation between the community and USC.”

Pay phones used to be the preferred method of communication among drug dealers
Payphones provide 911 operators the EXACT location of the person, NOT MOBILE CELL PHONES,  when a person at USC dials 911 on their cell , 911 operator has an approximation of the callers position by tower triangulation, but its not exact at all! , so for this specific reason, payphones in public places are a key security tool to provide 911 operators the exact location of the phone. Payphones where key during Hurricane Sandy and there should really be no public area without payphones. Thank you USC and Miranda for this venue! and fun chat
I would totally appreciate payphones. I lost my phone last week and waiting for my new one to get here is awful. Bring them back!

Villaraigosa said the most efficient way to reduce traffic and create significant changes to the city’s transportation is by building a sense of unity around the city. Throughout the discussion he answered questions from Bedrosian Center Director Raphael Bostic and METRANS Center Director Gen Giuliano.
Villaraigosa recognized the changes that city officials need to make, but also urged for change to start with the individual.
“I love to make fun of myself and say, ‘You know I’m late today because the mayor hasn’t fixed the traffic,’ but then I’ll be serious with people,” Villaraigosa said. “You know why we have so much traffic? Because all of us are addicted to our single-passenger automobiles, and we expect someone else to get out of theirs.”
Villaraigosa said the city faces many “hurdles” in public policy to fix the conditions of transportation, noting that the change will take time, but emphasized that what is important now is to encourage residents to embrace change in Los Angeles for the entire city’s benefit.
“Come on, if you want to kill a gridlock it’s not going to be easy,” Villaraigosa said. “You need a political leadership that looks you in the eyeballs and says ‘Hey man, I’m sorry. It’s going to cost you a little more.’”
Villaraigosa said his goals are not just to improve transportation in Los Angeles, but also to re-imagine the city in a new light. He hopes the coming changes will help L.A. serve as a model city for the rest of the world.
“We are to the world … what New York was in the 20th century and London in the 19th. We’re the Venice of the 21st century. We’re the portal to the East and the South,” Villaraigosa said. “We are the future. … I’m going to keep promoting that wherever I go, because I believe it to the core of my being.”
Villaraigosa also stressed the importance of gaining the support of campaign leaders and the community to make progress happen. Responding to questions about his personal accomplishments, Villaraigosa emphasized that progress could not be made without the support of campaign leaders and the community.
“These were not my accomplishments,” Villaraigosa said. “Listen, we did this together.”
Severe lover of your site, a significant variety of your weblog posts have really aided me out. Hunting in the direction of updates!
Did Mayor Villaraigosa take public transit (i.e Expo Line, Dash F, #81,#200 etc.) to and from USC for this meeting?

Journalism has changed a lot in the past five years. And Geneva Overholser has worked to keep USC at the forefront of that change.
Final stretch · Geneva Overholser said she plans to stay involved with Annenberg after she leaves in June. – Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
During her five years as director of the journalism school at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the journalism and public relations program have shifted dramatically to adapt to the 24/7 news cycle, fueled by social media and digital storytelling.
In addition to launching several news outlets, such as Neon Tommy and Intersections, Overholser supervised an overhaul of the journalism school’s curricula.
“There’s a lot more multimedia storytelling, there’s a lot more social media, but there’s also more entrepreneurial thinking and economic literacy,” Overholser said. “Nobody’s going to reinvent journalism now unless we also reinvent how it’s funded.”
Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III said Overholser was instrumental in the restructuring of curricula.
“She was the leader of the school’s effort to restructure the curriculum to make it more relevant and responsive to today’s very dynamic conditions,” Wilson said. “And for me, she was a great partner in our jointly held slogan, ‘innovate, innovate, innovate.’”
This also applied to public relations, which was also under her purview.
“I’m very happy that we have created a climate in the journalism and public relations programs that is really very collaborative,” Overholser said emphatically. “Of course not everyone agrees on everything -— it’s a faculty. But they are very collaborative and public relations and journalism have grown to respect one another more.”
Overholser said she is almost “ironically” proud of the public relations part of the journalism school, which comprises about half of it, because the program has grown from three to eight full-time faculty as well as in the aspirations of the school’s students since she arrived at USC in 2008.
“Public relations is changing just as much as journalism,” Overholser said. “And many of our public relations students are interested in advocacy, and what used to feel like advocacy journalism to me.”
Overholser said though revising the ciricula in the School of Journalism was met with some resistance from faculty, she is very open to criticism, and she respectfully rebuts it. She is also very active in the nationwide debate about the future of journalism, and encourages others to be as well.
“I do wish more people at USC Annenberg would make their voices heard and I wish we were more prominent in social media,” Overholser said. “We do have some people who tweet a lot or are on Facebook a lot, but we should have more. We have got to be leaders in this debate.”
And Overholser said this mentality will continue to exist when she steps down in June.
“I want to continue to keep my voice in the debate about the future of journalism. Every thoughtful person who cares about journalism wants to be in that debate,” Overholser said. “I worry that it’s controlled by a fewvoices, pugnacious white guy voices. … I want us to all be in there thinking together: people of color, women, young folks, old folks.”
In 2012, Annenberg was awarded the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication’s Equity and Diversity Award. This honor is a testament to Overholser’s steadfast commitment to diversity throughout her time at the university.
“I’m really proud of how diverse our faculty is and how diverse our student body is,” Overholser said. “We know that the future of journalism is not all white and it’s not all men.”
And while Overholser has been a bold voice, she also walks a tight line: She is critical without cynicism, confident without arrogance and strong without obstinance. If you chatted with her in a line at Starbucks, you would not know that she has lead a newsroom to win a Pulitzer Prize (as editor of the Des Moine Register), represented The Washington Post as ombudsman and served on The New York Times’ editorial board.
Even with this resume, Wilson said Overholser has exceeded expectations.
“When we were recruiting Geneva Overholser, we were told that she was at the very top of the field, and we were delighted when she accepted our offer. And we had very high expectations,” Wilson said. “Over the past five years, she has gone beyond even those high expectations to prove herself an innovative and effective director of the School of Journalism at the University of Southern California. And all of us owe her a great debt of gratitude.”

The Gayle Garner Roski School of Fine Arts announced Wednesday that Professor Erica Muhl will serve as the new dean of the school. Muhl will begin work as dean immediately.
Muhl has served as the interim dean of the school since September 2012 and has been working as an adviser for the school since January 2012.
Muhl worked to change the curriculum and programs of the school during her interim directorship, according to a press release. For example, Muhl has introduced several new international partnerships for educational exchanges. In addition, she has stressed outreach between the school and alumni constituencies for fundraising.
Before serving as interim director, Muhl was a professor of composition and associate dean for faculty affairs at the Thornton School of Music. She also chairs the University Committee on Academic review and  holds a doctorate in musical arts from USC.
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett said that Muhl’s timely appointment will benefit the school and its progress.
“The appointment of Dr. Muhl comes at an auspicious time for the Roski School,” Garrett said in a statement. “Situated in one of the cultural capitals of the Pacific Rim and nurtured by the university’s vibrant and growing artistic and scholarly community, the school is poised to ascend to the highest levels of creative work and recognition under the leadership of Dr. Muhl.”
In 2012, Roski rose in ranking as a fine arts school, rising in the U.S. News & World Report from No. 37 to No. 36.
Muhl’s work also extends beyond of the university — she served as assistant conductor at the Los Angeles Opera Theater, Seattle Opera and the Pacific Northwest Wagner Festival’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, an opera series. She has received several grants and awards from organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Endowment for the Arts.
Garrett said Muhl’s diverse background in the arts will enhance the program for students and faculty alike.
“In addition to a successful career as a performing and creative artist, she also brings to the position extensive experience across the arts and humanities in the areas of tenure, faculty development and mentoring, transformative faculty hires, strategic vision and academic excellence,” Garrett said.

After leading forces in Afghanistan as a four-star general and serving as director of the Central Intellignce Agency, David H. Petraeus now plans to take on a new role as a Widney Professor at USC, the university announced today.
As part of his position, which he will begin on July 1, Petraeus will teach classes during the academic semester, participate in panels and mentor student veterans and ROTC members.
Petraeus stepped down as the CIA director in November after admitting that he had in an extramarital affair with Paula Broadwell.

Petraeus was the keynote speaker at the annual USC dinner honoring veterans and ROTC students in March. His speech was the first public appearance since his resignation. During his speech he apologized for the affair.
“Please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret — and apologize for — the circumstances that led me to resign from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters,” Petraeus told the audience of 600.
University leaders said they believe Petraeus will bring unique qualities to his new role, which will benefit both students and professors.
“USC is thrilled to have General Petraeus join our faculty as a Judge Widney Professor,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “He embodies all the noble qualities of our founder along with a fearless commitment to excellence. His presence will have a profound impact on our students across many disciplines.”
Professors said Petraeus’ experience aligns well with the university’s goals.
“For the past 37 years, General Petraeus has served our country as a dedicated public servant and remarkable leader,” said Jack Knott, the dean of the Sol Price School of Public Policy. “Given our school’s focus on government and public policy, as well as the academic administrative home for the ROTC program at USC, it is a particular honor for us to have General Petraeus join the USC faculty.”
The Judge Widney Professor title is named after Judge Robert Maclay Widney, who founded USC in 1880 and played an important role in growing Los Angeles into an urban center. Widney professorships are appointed to those with expertise in the arts, sciences, professions, business and national leadership, according to a statement from the university.
Before the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him as director of the CIA in June 2011, Petraeus had served more than 37 years in the United States Army and was the commander of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and United States Forces in Afghanistan.
In addition to his military experience, Petraeus has an extensive academic background. He holds a doctorate degree in international relations from Princeton University and taught economics and international relations at the United States Military Academy.
Petraeus said he believes the university is an ideal place to serve as a professor because of its innovation and relationship with the U.S. military.
In addition, USC, along with Notre Dame, is one of two universities in the nation that has maintained an ROTC program since 1943.
“I’m very grateful to have an opportunity to be part of a great university that prizes academic excellence, that is doing cutting-edge research in areas of enormous important to our country, and that is known for steadfast support of its veterans and ROTC programs,” Petraeus said in a statement.
I agree Jmile! The fact that our university supports this war criminal is disgusting but not surprising.
I know what classes he is going to teach…national destruction 101…I am completly and utterly disgusted with USC
Need to do a tiny bit of research before putting “facts” in your article.  Not only has Kansas State University had an ROTC program longer, it has been in the same building since 1943.  Kansas State had its first full time Professor of Military Science 14 years before USC was founded.
He is massively overrated. The surge was meant to create the political conditions for national reconciliation in Iraq. despite the bloviating of morons, this did not happen.
^^^yes, USC sports should always be the primary academic focus of USC, not mere petty foreign policy matters (like war, life and deathetc)
Why are we so proud of appointing an individual with a severe lack of ethics and morals?  I’m disgusted that USC choose to associate themselves with this lowlife.  People like him have incredibly bloated egos and think they can get away with anything when they are in a position of power.  I’m very disappointed in USC.
President Nikias, worry about the decline in the athletic programs instead of highlighting the military agenda.
Other school have ROTC units that are older and continuous.

Yay!  Maybe now I can learn how to kill children with drones.  If a $160,000 education can’t teach me that, what’s it really worth?
Don’t feed the Troll
what classes will he teach? Im super interested, even if its not part of my major.
