As summer becomes fall, new fashion trends find their way to storefronts. This season features bold pieces with softer, flowy fabrics that bring to life the coziness of all things autumn. According to Glamour, “the free spirit” of fall has been unleashed, sporting a boho look that appears effortless as it simply drapes over the body. Shift dresses and blouses are all the rave because of their loose silhouettes and floral patterns.
In contrast to the shapeless ease of some outfits, sharp geometric lines also come into play this fall. The straight edge of accordion pleating on midi skirts accentuates the waist, making it a very figure-flattering choice. This polished cut establishes a sense of professionalism for the working girl, bringing a cutting-edge aesthetic to a new level.
September means back to school, and designers are giving that phrase a whole new meaning as the runway takes on schoolgirl styles. Collared shirts and button down skirts achieve the collegiate look when paired with the appropriate heels and tote purse.
For college students, wearing six-inch heels around campus might not be the best way to get around, so that is where the “sporty-chic” look comes into play. Pairing simple dresses with bold necklaces and Nike running shoes proves not only to be functional, but also stylish. Such “athleisure outfits” are easy to recreate and individualize. As fun as it is to follow the latest trends, making them unique adds a personal element.
Another trend of the upcoming fashion season is textured fabrics. Whether it is a crop top or a midi dress, knit is the fabric to wear this fall.  Cable knit paired with unconventional necklines proves to be a runway favorite, as conservative, high-neck knits have appeared more on the runways than low-cut tops.
Aside from soft knits, suede looks like its making a comeback this season. The textile itself is not unfamiliar, but it is more unconventional than other textiles, like leather, for instance. Suede dresses with straight silhouettes toy with the geometric elements also looking to be popularized this fall, considering the denser fabric doesn’t contain the same buoyancy as others.
Beside knit and suede, denim is another textile to watch out for. The casual blue hue complements brown leather booties and a chambray blouse for a possible double denim ensemble. Whether it is flared pants modeled by Karlie Kloss from the Express campaign or a light-wash mini skirt, denim is arguably the most sought-after textile for this fall. Speaking of denim, distressed jeans have gone from trashy to trendy as it is now one of the most popular items in street wear.
Street wear this fall, however, isn’t as laid back as it comes across. For a more chic appearance, the turtleneck, a recurring item in fashion history, has been given another chance. According to Glamour fashion consultant Giorgia Tordini, a black turtleneck and camel coat make the perfect pair. The pairing has been hitting it off this season after keeping under the radar these last few years. Mixed prints have also made a comeback. By mismatching a plaid maxi skirt with a striped long sleeved shirt it is considered not only funky but also fashion forward.
As mentioned before, this season is all about making a statement. Stand-out pieces, such as bulky jewelry and platform sandals can elevate any outfit. Making a statement, however, doesn’t mean just wearing avant-garde articles of clothing. It means establishing confidence through one’s wardrobe. From edgy to official, everyone should be comfortable to express themselves through clothing, and that can start with the latest trends in fashion this fall.

Late-night studying and crunch-time assignments prove to be obstacles in the way of a college student’s meal time. Laziness, along with odd class hours, can prevent a student from straying far from his or her room to forage for food. Empty fridges, limited funds and lack of epicurean knowledge can all lead to a hungry student. New meal delivery apps, however, provide a convenient and cheap way to feed students with options other than ramen and mac and cheese.
The app Postmates goes beyond conventional food delivery to bring the user anything from groceries to medication to liquor, perfect for a busy day where a trip to the grocery store is just not possible. Postmates gives the user endless options for delivery items, whether they be food or pharmaceuticals.
One of the most fun and diverse culinary experiences in Los Angeles is the famous world of food trucks, something natives and tourists alike adore. Dishes from favorite food trucks are sometimes hard to come by since these trucks tend to operate on a structured location schedule. But, a new app called Nummy brings the food truck foods of fantasy right to the front door. A popular food truck called Roaming Hunger created this app in order to bring some of its favorites to the couch potatoes of Los Angeles. Roaming Hunger will deliver anything from meatballs and burgers to mac and cheese. These comfort food gems are delivered for free, almost exclusively in the area surrounding USC.
For those students still trying to lose the freshman 15, or trying to stay healthy for the upcoming semester, the app Munchery delivers fresh-made, cold meals for the more health-driven student. These meals range from a plethora of cuisine inspirations and are prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients to give a nourishing meal. Munchery fights to combat hunger by donating proceeds from each meal to a local food bank. Their company also strives to remain sustainable and green, using recyclable materials to package their food and bike delivery to minimize gasoline usage.
Despite the desire for convenient and cheap food, sometimes it feels great to treat oneself with a nice meal. The app Caviar caters to this demographic, delivering high-quality meals from some of the best restaurants in the area. Apps like Caviar also have real-time GPS tracking so users can monitor how far away their food is and how long the preparation will take.
Foodie Shares, a new app that was recently launched in Los Angeles, has transcended the traditional means of food delivery that neglects the holistic story of cooking a dish. This app desires to design a community based network of chefs and users, encouraging a dialogue between the two. Chefs on the app can post and share their dishes while users can order the food, post feedback and see chef profiles. The chefs maintain a significant amount of control with this system and can determine where and when they deliver and the cost of the delivery.
Of course, among the list of notable food delivery apps are the oldies but goodies. One of the most popular delivery services is GrubHub, an app that allows users from over 600 U.S. cities to have dishes from their favorite local restaurants delivered to their front door. At USC, students can have delivery and take out from some popular nearby dives. El Cholo, Trio House and Agra Cafes are just a few of the choices that deliver straight to students’ front doors. GrubHub offers a wide variety of restaurant choices within the chosen area, also saving the user’s past orders for a more efficient future purchase process.
A similar service to GrubHub is Eat24, an app from which there are an endless amount of restaurants to choose. No matter what the craving, Eat24 gives the users the option to pay upfront and keep a line of communication with the chosen establishment, 24/7. This means that any mess-ups or order-altering is taken care of immediately.
No matter what the flavor, price or potential for greatness, Los Angeles plays host to a range of amazing food delivery apps perfect for a plethora of occasions, including, but not limited to, late nights out with friends, study sessions, a lazy Sunday or just a desire for a new culinary experience. These apps open up endless possibilities.

The espionage and spy genre has seen some acclaimed films in the past few years, including Skyfall and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. These movies have kept fans on the edge of their seats with anticipation, grandiose sets, tense moments and, to top it off, stellar lead actors. American Ultra, however, is a different type of spy movie, with an original story. Unfortunately, as unique as American Ultra is, it does not deliver as much as it could.
American Ultra is about former CIA assassin Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) who the CIA has determined is a liability to the organization and decides to terminate. Despite being a stoner who works a dead-end job, Mike proves hard to kill when his deadly skills are revitalized. Mike and his girlfriend, played by Kristen Stewart, have to find a way to evade the CIA so they don’t both end up in body bags.
Eisenberg’s performance as Mike is a standout in the movie. His character, a neurotic and quirky guy with a bit of social anxiety, is natural for Eisenberg’s repertoire, and it definitely shows. Even in scenes where Mike is eliminating bad guys like flies, his nervous tics and sheltered persona still shine through to remind viewers that they are definitely not watching a Daniel Craig copycat. He doesn’t just adapt his performance of Mark Zuckerberg either. He’s unassuming and quick to apologize about everything, unlike the know-it-all performance he gave when he portrayed Zuckerberg in The Social Network. Eisenberg’s performance is the best out of the oddball cast in this movie, but it’s not all that surprising considering he was nominated for an Academy Award.
While Eisenberg’s performance is great, Kristen Stewart is not too far behind. Stewart and Eisenberg have great chemistry in this movie, likely because this isn’t the first time the two have been on-screen together as a couple. Those who have seen Adventureland know that Eisenberg and Stewart played complicated love interests, similar to their relationship in this movie. Her best scenes come from give-and-take lines with Eisenberg, and she can just as quickly deliver the laughs as she can the dramatic moments. However, the majority of her scenes involve Eisenberg in some way, and it would have been nice to see her character develop without Eisenberg.
Aside from Eisenberg and Stewart, the rest of the performances are forgettable. Connie Britton of Friday Night Lights fame does a decent job, but she’s tragically underused in the movie. Fans of Friday Night Lights and Nashville might be disappointed to see this great actress fall to the wayside in terms of screen time, which can’t be said for Topher Grace from That ’ 70s Show, who nearly ruined the movie. Reminiscent of his performance in Spider-Man 3, Grace yet again shows how some actors are only good in one role, and his days on That ‘70s Show were the peak of his acting career. Scenes with Grace were nearly unbearable. Unnecessary cursing, poor comedic timing and awful dialogue lines make Grace’s performance as an arrogant CIA agent a major negative in the movie.
There are, of course, ups and downs to other aspects of this movie. The action is nothing special, aside from being extremely violent. People are shot, beaten and have their bones snapped like celery stalks throughout the entirety of the movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but those who are squeamish or aren’t in love with the idea of violence should reconsider before seeing this movie. There are a couple of cool standout action stunts and scenes that are almost cheesy at moments, but they add to the movie’s charm. The dialogue is also something that likes to flirt with the possibility of being cheesy, and it sometimes is. Don’t expect any quotable monologues or one-liners from this movie.
The most disappointing thing about this movie is its unrealized potential. With such an interesting premise, there was so much about this movie that could have been, but never was. There was so much more that could have been done with the characters, but a lot of their subplots felt rushed or glossed over. The “stoner who is actually a sleeper agent” is a concept that could have been made into something better than what American Ultra is. The idea could be further explored in possible future installments, but for now, what people see is what they get.
Overall, this movie was not a complete waste of money for an overpriced movie ticket. It had some laughs, it had some action and it had some great performances from Stewart and Eisenberg. It also had Grace who absolutely bombed. For now, this reunion of Stewart and Eisenberg fails to live up to Adventureland.

Good day, mate. P Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Kangaroos. These were virtually all the concrete things I knew about the country I decided to make my home for the next semester. I quickly learned, however, that there was more to the place I now affectionately call “Straya.”
In mid-July, I left Los Angeles to embark on my “Aussieventure,” excited for the opportunity to snuggle with koalas, dive in the Great Barrier Reef, pick up an accent … and study, of course.
In the days leading up to my flight, I became so caught up in making sure I took care of all the details before my departure that it did not really hit me that I was leaving. My concerns were whether or not I had packed enough shoes, as opposed to who I’d eat lunch with when I arrived.
I realized I was bound for Melbourne while sitting in the airport on Wednesday night, suddenly alone. Unaware of the prospects of meeting people upon arrival and unable to calculate the 17-hour time difference just yet, I felt trapped in my thoughts during the        16-hour flight — one that not only left me feeling anxious over the idea of potential solitude, but also disoriented because it was suddenly Friday when I arrived.
And then I got off the plane. It wasn’t being alone that worried me; the change in weather consumed the majority of my attention. Los Angeles had the perfect amount of sun and heat for the most part. I exchanged that for gray skies and a pretty significant wind chill. I wavered between the idea of bringing a down jacket or relying on layers. The former route would have been the wiser choice. I probably should have depended more on weather reports rather than my perceptions of “sunny Australia.” Though, learning to adapt to the cold weather was easy in comparison to other acclimations — I would prefer to be shivering rather than to be hit by a car coming down the opposite side of the road. Unfortunately, it’s easy to forget to look the wrong “right” way.
I arrived at my apartment that morning, ready to find a room bustling with seven additional roommates. As I found each room uninhabited, however, the shivering stopped and the feeling of loneliness returned. At that point I decided I should get active instead of wallowing in sadness. I forced myself to leave the fortress of sweaters I had managed to pile on to fight the Melbourne chill and ventured out. I went down and asked the receptionist for places to get good food; I knew I would fall in love with the city when her response was, “Wow, everywhere!” Leaving the nest — in both the literal and the metaphorical sense as the apartment is called Urbanest — marked the point where I kicked any feeling of anxiety or gloom. Even though I was alone for what ended up being a total of about three hours, it was the last time I would ever walk through Melbourne without a friend nearby.
Living in an apartment with several others was the best decision. That day I met one friend who introduced me to another and behold, I was unintentionally absorbed into a group. I spoke with my parents probably five times the morning of the first day, and then I forgot to call them till two days later. I realized that my good fortune is quite an anomaly with studying abroad experiences. Suddenly, my generic week of, “What do I do?” confusion was less about making friends and more about how I would live in this continent. Tossing $2 coins to the side thinking they were two-penny coins, I was oblivious to the abnormalities. Then again, I would never be able to understand why a $2 coin is smaller than the $1 coin.
After being here for over six weeks now, I can say I have adjusted — though I still check both sides of the road while crossing the street to be safe.
It’s only the first week back at USC, but, since the school year here begins with semester one in February and semester two in July, I have been doing the school routine for about five weeks now. In these five weeks, I have laughed, made friends from all over the world, explored the cultural epicenter of Australia, my city Melbourne and studied at Australia’s No. 1 university. I think it’s safe to say that my Aussieventure has only just begun.
Nice article, because being an
international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language.
Assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking
on life’s journey. A new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that aids anyone
coming to the US is “What Foreigners
Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American
Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in
foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors,
educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful
in the US and how they contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be
accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture,
friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after
graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to
get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to
work for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and
speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them,
the number one stumbling block they say they have to
succeeding here. 
   Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments,
immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow
students, and informative books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so
we all have a win-win situation.  Good luck to all wherever you study!

It’s been nearly three years since London-based indie rock band, Spector, released its debut album. All truly great things come with time, and Spector’s sophomore album Moth Boys, produced by British music label Fiction Records, is no exception. Available for download on iTunes today, Moth Boys is a bold step forward for an emerging band holding its own among the U.K.’s latest batch of budding talent. Spector’s new album features punchy yet reverberating vocals from lead man Frederick MacPherson lined crisply with sophisticated synthesizer backdrops.
The newest album frequently touches on the ever-growing complexities of the modern dating scene and effortlessly captures the sympathies of millennials. The first track on the album is titled “All The Sad Young Men” and begins as a reflection on fast-paced life. Memorable lines from the album’s introductory track include, “These girls like to pretend they can’t feel anything anymore /boys break like promises / but only behind closed doors” and peaks with a bombastic chorus echoing, “I don’t wanna make love / I don’t wanna make plans.” Though the introduction track sets the tone for Spector’s second album, “All The Sad Young Men” is not the most impressive track on Moth Boys.
“Believe,” however, is the best example of Spector’s unique, synthesizer-heavy sound. Though Spector may not be appreciated by all crowds, “Believe” is bound to become an anthem for those in indie rock circles. Spector uses soaring choruses throughout the album paired with melodic vocals that are reminiscent of 1980s pop. The album concludes with the punctuating track “Lately It’s You,” which is equal parts explosive and tragic. This swan song closes on a wild guitar solo that six-string enthusiasts will surely appreciate.
Where Spector excels in Moth Boys is in their allusion to the qualms of the new millennial in their lyrics. The sophomore release provides several memorable and relatable vignettes about modern relationships. Drummer Danny Blandy will likely go unappreciated but he does a superb job on the drums and certainly proves his value in this second album. What Moth Boys lacks is versatility and range. Though the lyrics are animated enough to wash out the never-ending background synthesizers in Moth Boys, it’s hard not to notice throughout the album. Then again, that resonates with their ’80s pop style.
That being said, fans and casual listeners alike will enjoy hearing the indie rock band live during Spector’s U.K. tour beginning on Oct. 13, following the release of Moth Boys. Notable tour dates include stops in Reading, Glasgow and Leeds, all before playing their final show in London on Oct. 29.
The airy starscapes that Spector creates for its listeners are perfect for any back-to-school playlist. One listen through Spector’s album and people might wonder why Spector has yet to make it big. Give it some more time. Moth Boys took three years to conceive before being released from its cocoon. Guardian has even ventured to mention Spector as an act “somewhere between Roxy Music and the Strokes, the Killers and Kanye West, Pulp and R&B and Frank Sinatra.” For eclectic combination sounds, look no further than Moth Boys.

Quarterback. The only position that can bring about devout praise and unheralded hate in a single game. Every team, no matter the conference, surrounding players or level (pro or amateur), starts and ends with the quarterback. If you don’t believe me, just look at Alabama and LSU last year. Two stacked teams at every position besides quarterback.
This season will be no different for the Trojans. The team will rise and fall depending on the performance of senior quarterback Cody Kessler.
I know what you’re all thinking. Kessler was fantastic last season, putting up numbers that not even Heisman winners Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart could reach.
And yes, on paper Kessler looked amazing, completing nearly 70 percent of his passes en route to 3,826 yards, 39 touchdowns and just five interceptions. Kessler led the Power 5 conferences in completion rate and trailed only Heisman winner Marcus Mariota in touchdowns.
To say the least, Kessler had a pretty phenomenal year. The problem? His team went 9-4, lost two games in the final minutes and got steamrolled by UCLA for a third consecutive year.
If you dive into Kessler’s numbers from last year, you’ll notice a disturbing trend. Against teams ranked outside the Top 25, Kessler put up video game-like numbers. Against top ranked teams, though, not so much.
For example, in games against Fresno State, Boston College, Oregon State, Colorado, Washington State, Cal and Notre Dame — all non-ranked teams at the time — Kessler threw for 2,434 yards, 32 touchdowns and just one interception.  Pretty amazing to say the least.
Now in games against Stanford, Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and UCLA — much better competition — Kessler managed just 1,071 yards (214 yards per game), four touchdowns and three interceptions. USC went 2-3 in these games, but it could have been 0-5 if Stanford had scored one of their 10 possessions inside USC’s 10-yard line and Arizona hadn’t missed a last-minute field goal.
Many will come to Kessler’s defense and claim the scholarship reductions severely hurt USC in the fourth quarter of games. While this may be true, against both Arizona State and Utah, the Trojans had the ball with a chance to seal the game with a first down. In both situations the Trojans failed to convert and lost in the final seconds.
Though Kessler had a monster year statistically, the jury is still out on whether or not he can follow in the footsteps of those before him and become the next great Trojan quarterback.
The losses of Nelson Agholor and Buck Allen to the NFL will hurt Kessler, but the pieces still surrounding him should pick up the slack. Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and redshirt sophomore Steven Mitchell are both another year older and junior wide out Darreus Rogers have made strides throughout camp. The threat of sophomore cornerback Adoree’ Jackson should also open things up for Kessler down the field.
Kessler has the benefit of sitting behind one of the most experienced offensive lines the Trojans have had in years. The Trojans return most of their offensive line, including preseason All-American Max Tuerk.
After somehow flying under the radar all of last season, Kessler now has the spotlight shining directly on him. ESPN rankedKessler third in their pre-season Heisman watch and named the senior quarterback to the preseason All-Pac-12 team.
If Kessler manages to lead the Trojans through the first half of the season undefeated, that spotlight will only grow. It will be interesting to see how the humble star out of Bakersfield responds once the lights are all on him.
It may be unfair to put all the pressure on Kessler, but when you play quarterback for the University of Southern California that’s the reality. Injuries, coaching and luck will all play a major factor this season, but it will all come back to Kessler.
If the Trojans go undefeated, Kessler is a hero. If they go 9-4 again, Kessler is just another quarterback, even if he puts up ridiculous numbers once again.
Honestly, I believe Kessler has the ability to lead the Trojans to a Pac-12 title and an appearance in the College Football Playoff. All of the pieces are there for this to be a successful season and Kessler has shown tremendous growth since he took over the starting job midway through the 2013 season.
The sanctions are over. Sarkisian is in year two. The Trojans have depth on both sides of the ball for the first time in years. Jackson is a star in the making.
All that’s left is for Kessler to lead us back to the promised land.

As USC lined up for a pivotal fourth-and-two play in the fourth quarter of the 2006 Rose Bowl Game against Texas, something immediately felt very, very wrong. Reggie Bush, who had just captured the Heisman Trophy, was nowhere to be found. Bush was merely a spectator on the play. Bush’s partner in crime LenDale White plunged into the teeth of the Longhorns’ defensive line, only to be stopped shy of the marker.
USC went on to lose the game 41-38.
In losing what was considered by some to have been the game of the century, the Trojans were forced to step down from their perch as the kings of college football. The dynasty’s fall had begun.
In addition to suffering the Rose Bowl defeat to Vince Young and company, the Trojans also had to bid a fond farewell to Bush and White — one of the finest tailback tandems the sport has ever seen.
What was so bizarre about the controversy surrounding Pete Carroll’s decision to leave Bush on the sidelines on that fourth-and-two play is that White was also one of the most talented tailbacks in the country that year. Plus, the burly White was absolute money in short-yardage situations.
Bush rushed for 1,740 yards during that 2005 campaign, with White not far behind with 1,302 rushing yards of his own. The two combined for over 3,700 yards from scrimmage that season, less than 100 yards away from equaling quarterback Matt Leinart’s passing total.
The fact that Carroll had two tailbacks of that caliber was remarkable. A few other running back tandems in the conference’s recent history have been similarly prolific and have possessed similar star quality, perhaps most notably Oregon’s LaMichael James and Kenjon Barner in 2011. James and Barner combined for over 3,100 yards from scrimmage for Chip Kelly’s Ducks that season.
What was truly special about USC’s 2005 tailback tandem, though, is that it exemplified the “smash and dash” backfield. The speed and elusiveness of Bush was breathtaking, but the human wrecking ball White was simply devastating around the goal line. Bush scored 16 rushing touchdowns during his Heisman campaign, but White found the end zone 24 times when carrying the ball.
The next great Bush-White type of duo may be on the field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sept. 5 against Arkansas State.
Welcome to primetime, Justin Davis and Tre Madden.
Davis, a speedy junior from Stockton, California, earned his fair share of touches in 2014 as Javorius “Buck” Allen’s backup. Allen carried the load, averaging over 21 carries per game, but Davis still managed to amass nearly 600 rushing yards on the season. Davis also demonstrated his ability as a receiver emerging out of the backfield, snagging 13 receptions on the year. The six-foot-one, 195-pound Davis physically resembles Bush, who is an inch shorter and just eight pounds heavier, though Davis was only an elementary school student when the former No. 5 was juking out defenders left and right for the Trojans.
Madden, meanwhile, is the same height as Davis but has some 30 pounds on his backfield partner. If Davis is the “dash,” Madden is certainly the “smash.” Madden is a hard-nosed runner capable of delivering punishing hits. Not surprisingly, Madden played linebacker during his prep days at Mission Viejo High School. That ferocity translates to his violent running style. Madden missed the entirety of the 2014 season with a turf toe injury, but he was outstanding in 2013, recording 904 yards from scrimmage and scoring seven total touchdowns. Madden is a redshirt senior who has obviously endured personal highs and lows, so he is likely beyond motivated to make plays in his final season as a Trojan.
“Justin and Tre give us a two-headed monster at tailback,” head coach Steve Sarksian said. “Both are quality players who fit well in our system.”
The Davis-Madden tandem could be incredibly dangerous for the same reason the Bush-White backfield was so terrifying: balance. It means balance between the ground game and the aerial attack, which should not be an issue seeing as redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler will command the respect of opposing defenses. It also implies a balance between smashing through defenses and dashing around them. Davis can turn a sliver of daylight into a trip to the end zone, but with an inch to pick up, Madden looks like he will be the go-to guy.
This is not to say that Madden possesses a one-dimensional skillset. He may be a bruiser, but he has the quickness and the vision to be an early down back as well.
Speaking of this balance, Bush logged just three more carries than White back in 2005. Running back usage is often situational. Backup running backs can still be some of the most productive and effective players in the nation, as seen with White in 2005 and Kenjon Barner in 2011.
Bush and White went nearly 50-50 with their carries a decade ago, and while Davis and Madden are supposed to be engaging in a position battle this offseason, splitting the carries could be just the ticket to keeping opposing defenses honest. If USC can consistently mix it up with Davis and Madden, defensive coordinators will get headaches. This is especially the case because both guys are capable receivers, even if that means serving as Kessler’s safety valve on check-down passes.
With Kessler and an excellent offensive line leading the way, Davis and Madden could explode this season.
By Pete Carroll not having Reggie Bush on the field on that 4th down (National Championship 2006) will always be one of the “biggest” college football blunders in College Football history ! 
Horrible decision !!!

As mock game week continued Wednesday morning for the     No. 8-ranked USC  football team, controversy was still in the air surrounding head coach Steve Sarkisian and his actions at the annual Spirit of Troy fundraiser last week.
“It was great to get back on the field,” Sarkisian said. “Today I felt at home coaching football.”
After Tuesday’s visibly taxing press conference, Sarkisian appeared his normal, upbeat self after practice on Wednesday.
“When you have to take on things and give things up about yourself it takes a toll on you,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian also confirmed that he has had a meeting with President C. L. Max Nikias.
“It went great,” Sarkisian said of their conversation.
Sarkisian said the team had a productive day at practice.
“We did some game plan stuff moving forward for Arkansas State,” Sarkisian said.  “We also did some competition things where they got to compete offense versus defense.”
Sarkisian expressed his excitement with the team’s enthusiasm and its overall “embrace the day” attitude.
“We’re moving in the right direction,” Sarkisian said on a successful day of practice.
Sarkisian also drew attention to the fact that USC is currently in its first week of fall classes, unlike many schools on its schedule.
Arkansas State, however, will be suffering the same situation as USC, as its first day of classes was also Monday.
On a similarly positive note for the Trojans, redshirt junior left tackle Chad Wheeler returned to practice following a concussion. He was also cleared for full contact in another major step on his way to recovering from a knee injury suffered last season.
“It gives us the versatility and tempo that we want to play with,” Sarkisian said on how Wheeler’s return will impact a veteran line. “It means guys don’t have to save themselves, knowing there’s another guy who can come in and play for him.”
After a very thin season last year, the offensive line is looking forward to a stronger year. Though the final five starting linemen have not been determined, Sarkisian expressed his joy at having another lineman to discuss.
“We’ve got a little time over the next few days to sort through that,” Sarkisian said.  “But it’s obviously a nice luxury to have Wheeler back.”
Wheeler’s return pushed sophomore Toa Lobendahn to right tackle, which is the versatile lineman’s fourth position since training camp opened.
Despite Wheeler’s confident return to the gridiron, the Trojans are facing a slew of injuries, though most do not appear to be very serious.
Highly touted tailback Ronald Jones II was limited for his second straight day of practice. Sarkisian said the freshman did not feel well but declined to specify any further.
Redshirt senior Antwaun Woods suffered a shoulder injury that Sarkisian said was not serious ; however, it did limit the defensive tackle to individual work.
Redshirt junior tight end Taylor McNamara suffered an apparent right ankle injury and did not participate in the latter half of practice. McNamara is a transfer from Oklahoma using the graduate transfer exemption to gain immediate eligibility for the Trojans this summer.
Freshman safety Ykili Ross did not practice following his injury during Tuesday’s practice.
Ross had a sling on his right arm and an ice pack on his right shoulder.
Junior tailback Justin Davis missed another day of practice following a rib injury.
“We’re going to have ups and downs when it comes to player injuries and what not,” Sarkisian said in a post-practice media interview that primarily revolved around injuries.
The coach was able to put a positive spin on the situation though.
“I think these are invaluable reps for some of our younger players,” Sarkisian said. “The goal is by next Monday to have as healthy of a football team as we can possibly have moving toward our first game.”

On Aug. 12 around 1:40 p.m., officers from the Los Angeles Police Department Southwest Division shot and killed a woman in an alley while responding to a robbery. The suspect was found with a knife and envelope of money, and a cartridge from a taser was found discharged at the scene. The LAPD has not released much information about the suspect or the incident to protect the investigation, but the Los Angeles Times reports that the officers claim the suspect “began to advance toward one of the officers while still armed with the knife,” and a witness reports that she knows “for a fact that [the suspect] was not charging at them.”
Even as an isolated incident, these inconsistent facts would warrant an open and thorough investigation; within the context of recent racially charged shootings and America’s shocking tradition of police brutality and opacity, however, it is impossible not to pass judgment on the LAPD officers. This woman should not have been killed, and LAPD’s lack of transparency about the shooting further showcases the department’s lack of responsibility.
In a move toward what is surely self-protection, LAPD has refused to release details of the woman shot in Baldwin Hills. Reports so far do not state her name or race or other identifying characteristics of the incident. This thinly veiled political subversion in a climate in which another racially charged incident could elicit public outrage, however, is sure to backfire. LAPD wants the public to trust them, but the department’s refusal to release information about the incident increases the already pervasive skepticism regarding LAPD’s tactics.
Serving a city that saw one of the largest police brutality protests in U.S. history, LAPD needs to focus on forming community relationships and rebuilding the public’s trust. To ignore the sociopolitical context in which this month’s shooting occurred is to remain grossly ignorant of the department’s obligation to the people.
Even assuming the officers’ claims are true — which over and over in the past year and throughout American history have proven to be false — the suspect should not have died.
If multiple trained police officers with armor, tasers, handcuffs and other tools cannot take down one fleeing suspect armed with what the Los Angeles Times called a “large kitchen knife” without resorting to gunfire, the LAPD is embarrassingly incompetent. The other, far more likely possibility is that police in the United States are out of control.
Though the U.S. stands out among most Western countries in terms of size and population, it would make sense for countries with similar democratic and cultural structures to have similar methods of policing, which would correlate with similar rates of police shootings. According to the Guardian, however, England and Wales saw 55 fatal police shootings in the past 24 years, while the U.S. saw 59 fatal police shootings in just the first 24 days of 2015.  The LAPD alone has shot 25 and killed 13 in 2015. Though the U.S. population is five and a half times larger than England and Wales, the disparity is still incredible shocking.
Numbers like these do not indicate that the police are “just doing their jobs.” People in London are not better than people in Los Angeles, though the relative prevalence of guns in the                       U.S. certainly doesn’t help with gun-related crime rates. In any city, there is crime and there are police who deal with it; the problem is not with the American people, it is with how police view themselves and the people they are supposed to “protect and serve.”
Hearing about police shooting and killing a suspect in any crime, even a violent one in which the officer had no choice, should be shocking and saddening. Any killing is tragic for both the victim and the perpetrator. Hearing about police shooting and killing someone for reasons regarding race or police aggression should elicit absolute disgust. In the U.S., however, both have become so commonplace that police assaults are considered the norm.
Police should be members of their community, reluctant to unholster their guns unless their own lives are endangered, and it would be a mistake not to acknowledge that there are exemplary officers who deserve recognition. Police forces as an institution in the U.S., however, are racist, over-militarized and almost entirely separated from the communities they are paid to protect, viewing their citizens as potential enemies to be taken down rather than fellow humans to empathize with.
Los Angeles — and the nation as a whole — needs a complete rethinking of the role of the police. LAPD must remain transparent about all cases, especially those in which a suspect is killed.
The department also requires larger, structural change to lessen police aggression and intimidation tactics that unfairly target minorities and excessively terrorize citizens. Only then can the LAPD have the audacity to expect trust from the community.
“Dailytrogan” why in the hoot are you even commenting on this ?
What does this have to do with the USC Trojans ??
How “far” to the “left” are you Dailytrojan ???
“that police in the United States are out of control” ????

THIS ARTICLE SEEMS VERY ONE SIDED COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO IS BIASED AND JADED. WHILE I RESPECT HIS OPINION  I AM OVER THE ANTI-POLICE DRUM WHICH ALL OF THE MEDIA, INCLUDING THIS JOURNALIST, INSISTS ON BEATING. I FEEL THAT SOCIETY ITSELF IS VIOLENT AND AGGRESSIVE, JUST LOOK AT ALL THE RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS. HOW IS THE POLICE SUPPOSE TO DEAL WITH HIGH CRIME, AGGRESSIVE ANTI POLICE CLIMATE WHERE NO ONE HAS ANY RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER LET ALONE LAW ENFORCEMENT. ITS A TOUGH AND DAUNTING TASK THAT NO ONE WANTS TO DO THAT IS WHY WE CALL 911 AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE. BECAUSE WE CAN’T DEAL WITH THE GUN TOTTING ROBBER, SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PERSON, LOUD PARTY NEXT DOOR, DRUNK NEIGHBOR OR MENTALLY ILL RELATIVE. I DO NOT EXPECT THE POLICE TO BE THERAPISTS, DOCTORS, MEDIATORS, OFFICIAL RECORDERS OR OTHER. I EXPECT THEM TO BE COPS AND THAT DOESN’T EXIST ANYMORE. TODAY WE CALL UPON A GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO HANDLE OUR PROBLEMS AND THEN CRITICIZE THE MANNER  IN WHICH THEY DID. I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES WHERE YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT THESE MINORITIES, WHICH THIS AUTHOR MAKES THE CLAIM FOR, STEADILY BEING KILLED/SHOT/ROBBED/ASSAULTED/VICTIMIZED, ON A DAILY BASIS,  OFTEN BY OTHER MINORITIES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY AND ITS TIME WE LOOK AT OURSELVES INSTEAD OF POINTING THE FINGER AT SOMEONE ELSE BE IT POLICE/GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION/GROUP. WE ARE A DANGEROUS SOCIETY AND FOR PROOF JUST WATCH THE EVENING NEWS. SO WHY THEN WOULD POLICE EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE.
A Rivas, You are Correct !!!

As the 2015-16 school year kicks off, the newly minted Undergraduate Student Government headed by President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler has a multitude of issues on its agenda. With a new USG administration and new provost, Michael Quick, in place, the time to tackle important student concerns and campus issues is now. Rarely do we get to see a combination of new faces from both sides of governance, and a myriad of opportunities can be realized if USG and the administration can marry their ideas and work together to improve the quality of life for students at USC.
Sampath and Fowler won the student election last spring on a platform of producing “real results.” With a non-greek President, the duo promised to speak out for those who are unheard and underrepresented on campus. They stood for a better future and promised to make changes that benefited the entire student community, not just a select few. With a majority support among students, the duo was swept into office, and it is time now to take that optimism and translate it into results. Quick was an in-house selection after a nationwide search for a new provost. With his prior experience, expertise and willingness to work with the student body, Quick has the potential to accomplish many goals this semester. In this column, I hope to keep USG and the administration accountable by discussing student government policies and proposing new ones.
USG and Quick, having recently joined forces, should introduce a detailed plan outlining what they hope to accomplish in their first 100 days and then throughout the semester. USG, together with the USC administration, has successfully extended the add-drop deadline. Students can now drop a class until week seven with no mark of “W.” This gives students more flexibility with their classes, as well as reduces the stress and toll classes take on students in the marathon of a semester. These kinds of proactive initiatives benefit students and positively impact student life. The addition of a Fall break is another key feature that benefits students, and there are many more factors that can be changed to help students.
However, USG should identify key features of student life that need improvement. For example, the egregiously outdated Web Registration website, where students sign up and register for classes, is in dire need of an overhaul. In 2015, it’s embarrassing to think we can Skype a TA for a class, but to sign up for that class, we use a site that echoes the early days of AOL. Searching by class name, a course description and the capacity to organize a schedule from a list of courses desired are some updates and options that should be added to help streamline the process of registering for classes and to reduce confusion and stress.
In the first 100 days, Quick, Sampath and Fowler should also look to help reduce classroom congestion. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, classes cannot be scheduled in 30 minute increments. As a result, classes that run for 90 minutes do not utilize the remaining half hour allocated to them for that classroom and 30-40 minutes can go by without a classroom seeing instruction. To make matters worse, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., classroom occupancy on campus hovers around 98 percent. Classroom space is in high demand and precious time is wasted because of scheduling restrictions. Efforts should be made to more efficiently schedule classes and decrease the gap time between classes.
With the construction of the new USC Village, the expansion of Metro lines and the regional connector and the rise of Trojan athletics on the horizon, USC is poised for new heights. Sampath, Fowler and Quick need to recognize the opportunities available to improve student life holistically, from athletics to academics to lifestyle and beyond. The first 100 days tend to indicate the strength and power of an administration, and it is important to showcase what USC is capable of and to demonstrate the change and hope that has been touted. It’s an exciting time to be a Trojan, and it is time to continue to show the world how we fight on.

Parties, alcohol, dancing, the occasional recreational drug, oh, and some studying here and there — these all seem to constitute the standard undergraduate experience. But a new UCLA study suggests that first-year students are focusing on success in education more heavily than ever before. The pressure of attending a university and becoming professionally successful could cause more harm than good, especially in the form of serious mental health issues. Universities, as a result, must carefully examine how high-cost tuition and student debt affect their students’ mental health.
As the study conducted by UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute,finds, students now focus more on their studies in the face of crippling anxiety when thinking of their economic future. For 82 percent of students, the survey suggests that it is “very important or essential” to be financially well off. Meanwhile, 61 percent of students reported only partying one hour or less a week. Studying is up, while partying is down; the desire of undergraduates to pursue higher degrees of learning past a bachelor’s, shows that, yes, ambition may be increasing, but stress levels are as well. This raises concern for the   well-being of students, as many might become more prone to violence, depression or suicide.
These fears were only reaffirmed in the UCLA survey, in which 12 percent of freshmen scored their “mental health as worse than most others their age.” In addition, 9.5 percent said they felt depressed, “signaling that students are
bringing with them emotional struggles.” The pressures to succeed in university could make the emotional  well-being of students seem nearly impossible.
The rise in mental-health related issues hardly exists in a vacuum Numerous university students witnessed their parents or guardians struggle during the economic crash in 2009. From this detrimental period, millennials learned the lesson that in order to succeed economically, a college degree is necessary. With looming student debt and rising tuition, the stakes of succeeding in the job market are just as elevated as the pressure students feel to succeed. Colleges must work to prevent this mental instability.
“Colleges around the country are struggling to meet the higher demands for psychological and crisis counseling,” said Kevin Eagan, interim managing director of UCLA’s Higher Education Research Institute.
Eagan’s observation comes at the heels of a lack of adequate mental health care for an increasingly stressed generation. A 2012               nation-wide survey from nami.org reported that 64 percent of college students who no longer attend an institution of higher learning dropped out for a mental health related reason. Of these students, more than 45 percent did not receive accommodations in addition to 50 percent who did not access mental health services.
Attending a university should feel like a second home, not a prison cell. To counteract rising mental health issues, universities should study potential stressors. For many, the student debt that follows graduation is enough reason to panic. Colleges should reduce tuition that can create student debt, and more research should be conducted to study the impact of debt on mental health. Many universities offer groups or classes centered around stress management in addition to lessening anxiety. While this can be considered effective, universities should also focus on how increasing student debt and tuition affects students’ well-being.
It’s not just the courses or professors that make up a university, it’s the students’ well-being and passion for education that do. Universities should look toward making their tuition more realistic in order to lessen the potential economic and mental detriment.

Alexa Nicoleyson | Daily Trojan
The night before my flight, I tossed and turned and looked up at the world map faintly illuminated by the moonlight above me. All I could think of was that there was still time to change my mind. What had I gotten myself into? Oh, Alexa, there is no way out this time. In that hour, leaving my country to study in London felt like leaping into a black hole filled with fear, doubt and the weight of the world.
Here I was, leaving behind everyone and everything I knew. Leaving behind my safety net and my comfort zone. Leaving behind all the things that had molded me into who I was.
But I had to take that leap of faith to answer one question: What was I without all those things? That’s what studying abroad is all about. To take myself out of all that is familiar, so that I can get plugged into a new environment, using only the wisdom of past experiences to adapt and work well within the new. It is under circumstances like this that the strength of my character is truly tested. It is in such situations that I feel like I am living a life worth living.
But it’s always easier said than done. I found that the hardest part was letting go — letting go of the worries, the what if’s, the fear and the doubt.
Just let go, and go, I kept telling myself. Yet, my first two days in London were characterized by shock and resistance accompanied by all-around numbness and anxiousness. I was fighting against the change all around me to cope.
On the third day, however, something changed. That morning, I left my apartment, alone for the first time, and just ran. After a few miles of peering through local food shops, business offices and shopping stores, I found myself gazing up at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Sweat running down my chest, ears and neck, my chest inhaling as much of the London air around me, I realized that I had to let go. At that very moment, I was amazed to be there.  I wasn’t scared anymore of the unknown. I had already done the hardest part. I had faced fear head on and got on that flight, committing myself to five months away from all that I had known.
I am here now. Completely here. Not fighting the change but building upon it, embracing the English accent, the slang, the immense amount of public transportation and anything new that the United Kingdom has to offer me.  #TroyMeetsWorld

If there is one thing I’m good at, it’s being melodramatic. Partaking in musical melancholy is a passion of mine. I shamelessly stare out of windows while sad songs play and pretend that I’m in music videos or standing in the rain during tragic scenes in movies. I plead the fifth on whether or not Natalie Imbruglia’s ‘Torn’ is one of my 25 top most played songs on iTunes.
I find catharsis in sad songs and counterintuitively start to feel happier after listening to them than I do after playing something more cheerful, and evidently I’m not alone. In fact, a survey of more than 770 people conducted by researchers at the Freie Universitat Berlin in Germany revealed that sad music can create a thoughtful and harmonious state of mind for the listener, facilitating contemplation and reflection – both necessary if you ever hope to overcome an emotional rut.
So I hope you consider this playlist Planet Fitness, home of the judgment-free vibes® that can be listened to while scrolling through Tumblr or dry sobbing into your pillow – that’s your own business.

Wide Receiver U · USC has a rich history of talented wide receivers and the combination of sophomore tandem of JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree’ Jackson could prove to be lethal during the 2015 season. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
With the departure of wide receiver Nelson Agholor and George Farmer to the NFL, the Trojans’ wide receiver corps will need to step up in order for the Trojans to live up to their pre-season hype. One would think that a program that lost its star receiver would be worried about the upcoming season, but not USC.
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, a returning star, will fill Agholor’s role as top receiver with ease following his standout freshman season. In his freshman season, Smith-Schuster racked up a total of 54 receptions for 724 yards for five touchdowns. In Smith’s debut against Fresno State, he tallied up 123 receiving yards, setting the first-year freshman record for a season opener. Against Washington State, Smith-Schuster had three touchdown catches to tie the USC freshman record.
Smith-Schuster was a 2014 All-American first teamer, 2015 Biletnikoff Award candidate and in the discussion for All-American honors. Coming off such success as a freshman, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise for Smith to better his performance from his freshman year.
With the immediate impact that Smith-Schuster had on the team as a freshman, he should easily take over the No. 1 receiving spot. Another year of experience means that he could up his game and become the next great receiver from USC.
Not only do the Trojans have Smith-Schuster, but they also have one of the most exciting athletes in college football. Sophomore three-way player Adoree’ Jackson, a returning starter, has explosive speed that can really help the Trojans out on offense. Jackson was a 3-way player on eight games in 2014. He also was a track sensation, winning the long jump in the Pac-12 championships and placing fifth at the NCAAs. Jackson has a type of power and agility that could make USC’s offense unstoppable.
Jackson also returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in 2014. One of the two being the 98-yard touchdown return against Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl. He was a 2014 Freshman All-American first teamer, Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year, and a candidate for the 2015 Heisman, Thorpe and Hornung awards.
Last season, Jackson caught a total of 10 passes for 138 yards and three touchdowns. If Jackson can get more offensive playing time this season, Smith-Schuster and Jackson can become an explosive one-two punch that the Trojans’ offense needs to have a long and successful season.
Junior wide receiver Darreus Rogers could be another piece to the puzzle for the Trojans’ offense. Last season, Rogers caught 21 passes for 245 yards and scored four touchdowns. This could be Rogers’ chance to shine on the football field. He only started three times last year, but if he can prove himself in practices leading up to the start of the season, he would be able to sprinkle in some experience and continue to add success to the Trojans’ young group of wide receivers.
Sophomore wide receiver Steven Mitchell was quite impressive and started to turn heads as one of the stars in 2015 spring drills. Last season, he had seven receptions for 82 yards with two touchdowns. With Mitchell itching for more playing time, he could be expected to be another weapon for USC’s offense.
USC will also have great options from the newest Trojans. At 6-foot-3 and 205 lbs. junior wide receiver Isaac Whitney, from Riverside Community College, has the size and speed to make an immediate impact for the Trojans. As an early enrollee, he has had time to learn and grow comfortable with the Trojans’ offense. He is another option to be paired up with Smith; with the two of them together, expect USC’s offensive to be extremely successful.
Junior wide receiver De’Quan Hampton from Long Beach City College will join the team in the fall. Standing at 6-foot-4, Hampton is a big receiver who can dominate in one-on-one situations. He is just another option in USC’s roster that can give their offense additional options for success.
Along with junior college transfers, USC will have three incoming freshmen in the fall to be used as wideouts — in addition to their other positions. Running back and wide receiver Dominic Davis from Bishop Alemany High, may only be 5-foot-10 and 175 lbs. but his speed could be incredibly helpful to the Trojans’ offense. In 2015, he placed third in California in the 100-meter-dash and fourth in 2014. Two-way player Isaiah Langley from Foothill High stands at 6 feet and 165 lbs. As a senior, he had 33 catches and 12 touchdowns. Both Davis and Langley were Prep All-Americans. The third of USC’s newest freshman wideouts is safety, center back, wide receiver Ykili Ross from Riverside Poly High School. Ykili had 50 catches and 15 touchdowns as a senior. Any one of these freshmen could follow in the footsteps of Smith-Schuster.
Each of the options for receiver for the Trojans’ offense brings his own skills and talents to the plate. Individually, they each shine in their own aspects, but together they could create an incredibly successful offense and continue USC’s history of having some of college football’s best wide receivers.

Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The USC women’s soccer team opened its 2015 campaign in Albuquerque at the New Mexico Lobos Invitational, beating Texas Tech on Friday before falling to Florida State on Sunday.
The Women of Troy earned a 1-0 victory over Texas Tech, a team ranked in the preseason top 15. The Trojans and Red Raiders had actually never met on the pitch before, but the inaugural game did not disappoint.
Opening day can sometimes lead to more questions than answers, but that was not the case for the Women of Troy in Albuquerque.
It all started with the last line of defense. Goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, a transfer from Oregon State, made four saves on the evening. Prudhomme was a standout with the Beavers before making her way to Troy. After sitting out a mandatory redshirt year, she turned some heads in her USC debut.
Head coach Keidane McAlpine lauded Prudhomme, explaining that she holds herself accountable at all times and thus commands the respect of her teammates.
“Sammy Jo is a very confident goalkeeper, but she studies her craft really well,” McAlpine said. “She holds herself to a super high standard in every aspect of the position.”
Prudhomme’s clean sheet was impressive, but she was certainly aided by a strong performance from the back line.
“Defending is a mindset,” McAlpine said.
Defending is also something that the Women of Troy constantly refine in practice and in games as they are always working to improve their communication and unity. McAlpine emphasizes total team defending, from the forwards to the goalkeeper.
The back line itself is a unit, introducing a new piece since last season.
Freshman Ally Prisock made her debut for the Trojans against Texas Tech, and she looks to be an integral part of the defense over the next four years.
Prisock and company allowed just six shots to get through on Friday, four of which found their target. Additionally, USC only allowed one corner kick all game. Though the Trojans dominated in the “shots on goal” category, it is also important to focus on the fact that the Red Raiders managed just one corner kick. Corner kicks, like set pieces in general, are incredibly dangerous. The Trojans, meanwhile, threatened Texas Tech with a whopping nine corners.
Prisock may have been the only freshman in the starting nine, but it was another newbie whose name appeared on the score sheet.
Hailey Hite, an Orange County product, entered the fold in the second half with just 26 minutes to play. It is safe to say that she will never forget her short but sweet USC debut. Hite beat Texas Tech goalkeeper Lauren Watson from some 12 yards out with just seven minutes remaining in regulation, giving the Trojans the go-ahead goal and the win.
Senior forward Jamie Fink, a veteran leader who was also an impact freshman once upon a time, praised the play of USC’s youngsters.
“It’s amazing to have freshmen like that step up and show that you don’t have to be an upperclassman to do these types of things,” Fink said.
Riding an emotional high after downing the Red Raiders, the Trojans faced off against the top-ranked team in the land, the Florida State Seminoles. There are not many tests quite like playing the defending national champions in the second game of the season.
The Women of Troy gave the ‘Noles all they could handle, but in the end FSU nicked a late goal and claimed the victory. A 1-0 defeat against Florida State is certainly not an egregious offense, and maybe the Women of Troy will get another shot at the reigning national champs in the NCAA Tournament.
Teams can learn from early season losses like the one against FSU and, unlike college football, one loss does not have the potential to derail a season.
Quite frankly, the Women of Troy have a lot to be proud of after their trip to the desert. The squad defeated a strong Texas Tech team before just losing to the 2014 national champs.
McAlpine learned that he has some precocious freshmen in Prisock and Hite, and he also found that his defense could actually come back bigger, stronger and angrier than it was a year ago.
“I think our defense is super disciplined this year,” Fink said.
With strong defending leading to equally impressive attacking play, the Women of Troy look poised to have a terrific season.
“I think this was a major confidence booster,” Fink said, referring to a strong showing this weekend. “It was all very positive.”
McAlpine echoed these sentiments and said he felt good about his team’s performance.
“I feel like our team really met the challenge on the weekend,” he said.

Would it be a proper USC football offseason without some off-field problems? Of course not; it’s a program always under the national microscope, in a city so desperate for drama that it created The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
But even given that, Trojan football had another summer of very bad PR. Not just one, but two separate instances of disciplinary issues have dampened the excitement surrounding such an exciting team.
There are so many positive storylines we could be focusing on going into this 2015 season, from having the top-ranked recruiting class to being ranked eighth in the preseason AP Poll to the Heisman hype surrounding quarterback Cody Kessler to the Pac-12 media poll’s prediction of a conference title. But instead, the big story this week is Coach Steve Sarkisian’s drunken tirade at a USC booster event, just weeks after hearing about major developments in tight end Bryce Dixon’s alleged sexual assault.
Though it’s maybe not as wild or mysterious as Josh Shaw’s “superman lifeguard” hoax last year, the pair of preseason headline grabbers are equally — if not more — significant and concerning because of the nature of one and the person involved in the other. Both incidents involve questionable decisionmaking while under the influence, but that’s about where the similarities end. It’s an issue with very broad implications across society, and one that’s particularly endemic here at USC.
The Dixon incident is still somewhat up in the air. USC’s expulsion has been removed, but an investigation is still ongoing. The issues of Title IX policy, sexual assault and due process deserve their own columns, and he could be absolved of any wrongdoing, but it certainly has not been good publicity for USC football.
There’s less uncertainty regarding what happened at the USC Salute to Troy event. There were plenty of people in attendance and a short video clip from it leaked to ESPN. Sarkisian has not denied that he was intoxicated, inappropriate, incoherent and disrespectful at a sanctioned USC event. The question is if Sarkisian can be disciplined. Digging into the personal lives of full-time professional coaches is only slightly less uncomfortable than that of their players, but this comes with the territory in Division I football.
After a press conference Tuesday, Sarkisian reiterated his apology but said he was moving on from the incident and that there wouldn’t be any suspension.
I’m surprised that there won’t be.
I won’t go as far as putting myself into Pat Haden’s shoes and saying he should have been suspended. But I would have guessed that such behavior would warrant more than a public chastising from Haden and a promise to seek help.
I would have been surprised at anything more than one game. Daily News columnist Mark Whicker suggested a season-long suspension “at the very least,” and some people I talked to even suggested even termination, which I think is totally going overboard. If Sarkisian showed up drunk at a practice or game, that would be a different story and indicative of some really severe irresponsibility, but the Salute to Troy event was more like a company holiday party.
Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston was suspended for one game for inappropriate public comments last season. Haden suspended former  basketball coach Kevin O’Neill from a portion of the Pac-10 tournament for a verbal altercation with an Arizona booster several years ago. Sarkisian’s comments were at least as embarrassing as Winston’s, certainly more so than O’Neill’s, and he should be held to a similar standard. Offensive coordinator/quarterback coach Clay Helton has successfully served as a head coach in a one-game interim role, and the Trojans should be okay against Arkansas State.
This isn’t the first time Sarkisian has had a problem with alcohol. In 2012, he made similarly derogatory comments about Pac-12 schools during a Washington pep rally. Undisclosed sources have said that alcohol was prominent around Huskies facilities, and it wasn’t until after this weekend that Sarkisian banned alcohol in the USC locker room after games, a rule that probably should have already been in place.
It is more than just that, and part of his job description is making public appearances. If President Obama showed up hammered for a speech at the Democratic National Convention next summer, it would be a huge deal and certainly prompt some resignation dialogue.
But I really don’t think this warrants a firing, just something more than a slap on the wrist. Sarkisian didn’t endanger anyone else; he was irresponsible, but this isn’t anywhere near the level of the Penn State Sandusky scandal that led to Joe Paterno’s firing. There is precedent for a drunken incident costing a football coach his job. Gary Moeller resigned as the Michigan head coach after a public intoxication, but that was met with a lot of surprise from the Wolverine community.
While there is a line between personal irresponsibility and harming others, which Sarkisian did not cross at the event, the issue of substance abuse certainly blurs it. Damaging “the brand” of a football team isn’t really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. If Sarkisian had missed the event because of a gross underestimation of traffic, it would have been similarly irresponsible. Something like that would be inexcusable for a professional on such an important night. But that barely would have generated a tweet in the press. When inebriating substances are involved, though, the magnitude totally changes even if the end result is the same. How far away is public intoxication from drunk driving? Or a drunken domestic assault?
These are real issues on USC’s campus. There have been multiple instances of USC fraternities getting in trouble because of alcohol. The federal investigation into USC’s compliance under Title IX has a lot to do with alcohol-infused sexual assaults. One student died of alcohol poisoning last year, and a visiting student at a USC party was so intoxicated he walked all the way to a freeway on-ramp and was fatally struck by a car. Partying too hard and forgetting to wake up for a midterm certainly isn’t a crime or dangerous to anyone else. But that’s the kind of behavior that gets glorified on BroBible, and if USC doesn’t show there’s some kind of consequence for actions like that, then the only thing students will remember from this incident is the BroBible article glorifying it — “If you told me I had to stand up in front of a bunch of tight-assed donors and kiss their asses on a Saturday night, I’d tell you straight up I’m getting hammered for it,” poetically wrote the blog’s Matt Keohan.
There’s a little bit of me that does think this is funny. If there’s any good to come from this, then I hope the usual frat stars who don’t last until halftime now feel a special connection to Sarkisian and actually stay the whole game. Plus, if College Gameday comes to campus for the UCLA game —knock on wood — there are sure to be some fantastically hilarious signs in the crowd.
But that looks like it’ll be the only silver lining to this event. Hopefully Sarkisian will get the help he needs and can one day be an example of someone who overcame these problems. But it doesn’t look like this academic institution will take advantage of this learning opportunity and make an example.

Taking responsibility · Head coach Steve Sarkisian aplogized for his inappropriate behavior in front of a bundle of media members at his press conference before the team’s practice on Tuesday. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Three days after reportedly speaking while intoxicated at USC’s annual Salute to Troy event, head football coach Steve Sarkisian publicly apologized before the media on Tuesday morning before practice in a press conference at Howard Jones Field.
“I’d like to apologize for my behavior Saturday night,” Sarkisian said. “It was inappropriate. I feel bad for the University of Southern California, [President] Max Nikias, [Athletic Director] Pat Haden, our players and my own kids. The way I acted was irresponsible. It is something I obviously don’t condone.”
Sarkisian reportedly used foul language and called out other programs at the on-campus event Saturday night in front of donors and alumni before being taken off stage by Haden and Associate Athletic Director J.K. McKay.
The 41-year-old head coach admitted he mixed unspecified medication with alcohol and indicated that he will seek treatment, though he does not believe he needs to attend rehab.
“I truly believe in myself as a coach to lead this team and to be the best coach for this team to win a championship,” Sarkisian said. “I’m thankful that I’m surrounded by wonderful people, and that this university can offer no better support than any other university in the country, but I was not right.”
Sarkisian admitted that there was alcohol in the coaches’ locker room “after great wins,” but maintained that there was never alcohol in the team’s players’ locker room.” Alcohol has been banned from the facility entirely, according to Sarkisian.
“I don’t believe so,” Sarkisian said when asked if he had a drinking problem. “Through Pat and the University, I’m going to find that out. I’m going to go to treatment and deal with it.”
The second-year head coach said he met with the team and disclosed everything. He also reached out to Nikias and had talks at great length with Haden.
“At the end of the day, you play the hand you’re dealt,” Sarkisian said. “I’m going to play my hand. I’m not proud of the things that have occurred for me, but I know I’m a good football coach, and I know we’re a good football team.”
Two of the team’s leaders in quarterback Cody Kessler and linebacker Su’a Cravens also showed support for their coach following his press conference.
“He came to us as a man and looked us in the face and apologized, and I think this brought us closer together,” Kessler said.
Kessler recalled that he knew something wasn’t right when Sarkisian took the stage, but appreciated how his coach apologized immediately to the team.
“Bottom line for us is that’s our head coach,” Kessler said. “We’re going to support him no matter what. Mistakes happen.”
Cravens noted that nothing on the field has changed.
“We’re the same team before and after,” Cravens said. “Nothing has changed. We’re a tight locker room, and we have a great coaching staff.”
Kessler affirmed the team’s support for their head coach.
“There’s no one else in the country we’d want as a head coach,” Kessler said.
Sarkisian’s acts didn’t go unpunished, though, as Kessler said the team made him do up-downs on Monday.
“He came back drenched in sweat,” Kessler said.
Following the press conference, the team got back on the field for its first practice of the week and will now try to shift the attention back to the field.
“Everybody couldn’t wait to get to practice,” Kessler said. “We couldn’t wait to get to an environment where we felt safe and comfortable with him as our head coach.”
An adult had a bit too much to drink at a drinking event and then apologized for it. I believe now is the time to say “who cares?” and move on.
By Trojan standards, Sark did not have a good year. Pete’s teams were great in the second half, Sark’s just the reverse. His tenure might have been troubled even before this incident. What’s next? Haden and Nikias will decide. With the help of wealthy alums — if they weigh in.
Sark is on shaky ground one way or another.

Strength in numbers · El Centro Chicano is a Latino and Chicano organization for student leaders at USC located in the Student Union. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The percentage of Latino students attending USC has remained steady at about 12 to 14 percent for the last decade despite the growing Latino population in California during the same time period.
USC demographics for the Fall 2014 semester show the percentage of Latino students at 12 percent. Domenika Lynch, the executive director of the Latino Alumni Association, said that this percentage also happens to be the national percentage of Latinos attending college.
According to the Los Angeles Times, demographers’ long-standing prediction that Latinos would soon outnumber whites in California was confirmed on July 1, 2015. The historic shift was initially expected to occur in 2013 but was hindered by slow population growth.
After Hawaii and New Mexico, California has become the first large state and third state overall without a predominantly white population. The United States Latino population is at 55.4 million. Los Angeles County and California have the largest populations of any county and state, respectively.
The ethnic composition of the USC student population has not evolved at the same rate as that of California. However, USC may face a slower increase in the number of Latinos enrolled due to the high enrollment numbers of out-of-state and foreign students.
Lynch expressed her desire to see more Latino students admitted to, graduating from USC and becoming successful alumni. She argued, however, that the admissions process should continue to consist of a holistic review of students’ academic and extracurricular strengths, regardless of ethnicity.
Lynch commented on Latino presence at USC growing together  with the country’s increasing population of Latinos.
“Latinos currently make up 39 percent of California’s ethnic composition — the largest single racial/ethnic group in California,” Lynch said. “I am confident that as Latino’s grow in numbers in the state, USC will continue to attract the best and the brightest.”
Stephanie Gioeli, a sophomore majoring in business administration, commented on the socioeconomic burden of getting into highly selective universities such as USC.
“Higher education often seems reserved for those who can afford it, which is why universities in these demographics usually put extra effort into aiding minority groups in getting into such institutions,” Gioeli said. “It is surprising to me as a Latina currently enrolled that USC, a university that prides itself on immersion with the surrounding community, has not adjusted their admissions process to reflect the local majority that once was a minority.”
The LAA offers partial-tuition scholarships that range from $500 to $5,000 each academic year to USC undergraduate and graduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to the Latino community. Around 7,500 scholarships have been awarded since the organization’s founding in 1973.
According to Lynch, the LAA hopes to continue raising scholarship funds in order to ease the financial barrier felt by some Latino students.
“We admit a good number of Latino students — we need to do a better job in the conversion process,” Lynch said. “The LAA is determined to raise scholarship funds to increase the numbers of Latino students who get accepted to USC but choose another school because of scholarships offered.”

App for that · Visually impaired app users don’t need to see the graphics to play StealthFly. The game uses sounds to communicate its obstacle locations. Users can enable the graphics when playing StealthFly. – Photo illustration by Mariya Dondonyan
Students Kate Glazko, Akhilesh Saklecha and Roy Zheng recently launched StealthFly, a new mobile game playable by the visually impaired via the Apple App Store, Google Play and Amazon Appstore.
In similar games such as Temple Run, players often have to avoid obstacles such as rocks or cracks. But in StealthFly, players have to avoid sound obstacles. In the game, the user pilots a plane to evade obstacles based on note pitches that the game emits. A higher pitch indicates that the obstacle is more toward the right. Conversely, a lower pitch indicates that the obstacle is more to the left. This feature allows users who are visually impaired to play the game since they know where the obstacles will be placed based on the sound.
Glazko, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration, said that unlike most games, graphics are not necessary to this app.
“We made the game so you can play it without visual graphics,” Glazko said. “How it works is that all the instructions are voice prompts and the game itself is played so that sound creates the obstacles.”
The game also contains optional graphics enabling those who are not visually impaired to play it. The game has already been tested by people with visual impairments.
The app was submitted into a competition known as SS12, a hack-a-thon that encourages undergraduate and graduate programmers to develop innovative and empowering software projects aimed at benefiting disabled persons.
“It’s a great competition because there aren’t so many apps for accessibility out there, and this competition encourages people to explore those issues and accessibility,” Glazko said. “For me, for instance, I didn’t realize how many things are impossible to do for people who can’t see the screen.”
The students eventually went on to win the title of 2015 U.S. SS12 Champions. According to Glazko, the competition helped the three students get their app noticed.
“[SS12] is a good way to get apps into the accessibility marketplace and websites and other things,” Glazko said. “It gave us some assurance that what we had was a good idea and that people would actually want it.”
Glazko said winning the hack-a-thon made the trio even more motivated to complete the application, especially after seeing the support they received at SS12.
“[Our team hopes] to reach out to several blogs and mailing lists of people that we’re connected with or that we have seen on the web that talk about accessible apps, and we hope to get it out there,” Glazko said.
Zheng, a business administration and computer science major as well as one of the project’s lead programmers, said he hopes this won’t be the last app aimed at serving the visually impaired community.
“What we hope to do is bring this genre of game to this population,” he said.
Glazko said she wants the game to be used as a tool to influence others in the gaming industry.
“We hope this game inspires people to realize that there is an entire group of people that can’t play mainstream games,” Glazko said.
