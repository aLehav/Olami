Fresh off an impressive, freshman-led showing at Cal State Fullerton, the USC women’s cross country team returns to action Saturday at the UC Irvine Invitational 5K with reason to expect success.
Team captain senior Bridget Helgerso, will return to run for the Women of Troy, just one of several veteran runners who did not race at Fullerton competing for the first time this season. USC coach Tom Walsh believes the return of more experienced runners will boost the Women of Troy’s performance.

“We’re going to see where our veterans are at right now,” Walsh said. “We had a great grouping in terms of our one through five runners last Saturday. We’re hoping for the same this Saturday but at a higher level and with faster times.”
There are still a few key absences, however. Standout junior Szofia Erdelyi will not race on Saturday because of plantar fasciitis (a painful inflammation on the sole of the foot) listed as the cause. Expected top-five runner Shea Wickland will also miss the Irvine 5K to rest an injured knee. Additionally, freshman Christy Ambrosini, who last week finished as USC’s top runner at Fullerton, will not race as the result of back and hip injuries.
“We are off to a bit of a slow start because of some freak injuries,” Walsh said. “But I’m confident that both Szofia and Shea will join us at the Stanford invite in a couple weeks, unless anything unexpected comes up.”
Injuries or no injuries, Irvine should be a tough test for the Women of Troy. Several strong competitors will toe the line alongside USC on Saturday, including host UC Irvine as well as strongholds like UC San Diego, Pepperdine, Fresno State and Cal State Northridge.
“This will definitely be an upgrade in competition,” Walsh said. “Last week was a good start for us, but this week will certainly be a notch up from that. It’ll be an indicator of where our girls are at this year, especially the ones who haven’t raced yet.”
Irvine’s tougher competition should provide a stepping stone for USC, who plan to run what could be their toughest meet in two weeks at Stanford. However, as Walsh has noted in the past, USC is used to facing tough foes in the Pac-10. As a result, the mood remains optimistic for the Women of Troy.
“I’m greatly looking forward to seeing how we match up against some of the better schools.” Walsh said. “It can only make us stronger.”

Despite losing three All-Americans to graduation last year, the USC women’s soccer team entered this season ranked eighth in the country and were expected to reload with young talent.
Four games into the season, however, the Women of Troy have a record of 1-3 and have dropped out of the national rankings.
Out of rank · Meagan Holmes is one of the few Women of Troy with significant playing experience. The core of the team is young and unproven, part of the reason USC made a quick exit from the national standings. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Using a starting lineup featuring six freshmen and sophomores, USC has struggled to find the chemistry and intricate passing game that defined its successes in the past two seasons.
USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, while disappointed with the early season results, understands the growing pains associated with having a young team.
“You have to give each player the opportunity to grow into it,” Khosroshahin said. “You have to stand up and take responsibility when things don’t go well, and I think they’re doing that. I definitely see improvement every time they step on the field.”
The Women of Troy showed flashes of their potential last weekend in their 4-0 rout of Cal State Fullerton. USC struggled again two days later, however, losing 1-0 to Ohio State on a late penalty-kick goal.
“I think with any group that’s young and inexperienced, there’s gonna be mistakes,” USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen said. “I think it would be a little more frustrating if we were older, but because we’re so young we’re trying to figure it out. But it’s getting better and that’s what counts.”
USC’s young players will have a chance to continue to improve this weekend when the Women of Troy take on Gonzaga and Michigan at McAlister Field.
The Zags come into their Friday match against USC with a 3-1 record. Redshirt Midfielder senior Lori Conrad leads the team with three goals while junior midfielder Sheridan Jones has three assists. Gonzaga did lose to USC’s Pac-10 rival Washington State 3-0 last week.
Michigan is 3-3 on the season and will face Cal State Fullerton Friday before they take on the Women of Troy on Sunday. The Wolverines scored a combined eight goals in wins last week against Central Michigan and Eastern Michigan. Midfielder Jackie Carron leads the team with two goals and three assists.
USC could get a boost this weekend in the form of All-American defender, redshirt senior Meagan Holmes, who may return this weekend from an ankle injury suffered earlier this season. Junior Ashli Sandoval, who led USC in points last season, has filled in for Holmes in defense and will be allowed to return to her normal position in the midfield if Holmes is able to play.
“We’d love to have Ashli in the midfield,” Khosroshahin said. “But we need other players to step into those roles and perform.”
USC’s game against Gonzaga kicks off at 3 p.m. on Friday, while Sunday’s contest against Michigan is set for a noon start time.

LaGarrette Blount.
Many of you know him as the man who, last weekend, threw the best punch on a blue field in history.
But once you get past how that one punch that connected with Boise State defensive end Byron Hout’s jaw right made watching that slow game worth it, the reality of the situation sets in.  That was the first time many had ever heard the name LaGarrette Blount, and now Blount will be always be remembered as a villain.
It’s not only Blount that is affected; the University of Oregon reputation fell much harder than the 241-pound defensive end. For weeks that replay will be shown during broadcasts of Oregon football games and it will be included in national year-end summary packages about the college football season.
Blount hopped, skipped and jumped over the fine line that separates uncalled-for taunting from “friendly” trash-talking (yes you just read the most obvious statement since Brett Favre announced his return to the NFL). Sure, trash-talking happens all the time, and mostly it’s in good nature. Just ask Matt Hasselbeck about his famous line when he won the coin toss a few years ago in a playoff against Green Bay,:
“We want the ball and we’re gonna score.”
Unfortunately, as in Hasselbeck’s and Blount’s cases, the nudges and knocks at the opponent come back to haunt you.
Those two examples are at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Hasselbeck’s comment was perfectly fine, as he did it mainly in good humor and didn’t inflict any physical or emotional harm on the opponent (although the same can’t be said for the harm done to himself).
But with the USC-Ohio State football game coming up, there have been a few remarks made by people associated with USC that are uncalled for and have crossed the line between good, joking fun and harmful, ignorant taunts.
You might remember last year, how former USC Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Carson Palmer, now of the Cincinnati Bengals, came out before the showdown at the Coliseum and said, “I cannot stand the Buckeyes … It’s amazing to hear what those guys think about that university and what they think about that football program and Tressel and all the crap I gotta put up with being back there … I’m really getting sick of it.”
Rooting for your alma mater is one thing. But taking a cheap shot at another program, especially a program that shares the same fans that come out to your games, is a classless act that reflects poorly on USC.
However, this year it’s his brother’s turn. Jordan Palmer is a third-string quarterback on the Bengals with older brother Carson, and he played quarterback at UT-El Paso. And yes, he’s the same guy who invented the iPhone application called Run Pee, which lets people know the points in various movies to hit the restroom and then fills you in on what you missed upon your return. Pretty ingenious. But I digress.
On Tuesday, the younger Palmer took a page out of his older brother’s book and made comments on the radio about Ohio State that he’ll probably hear in Cincinnati for a long time (or however long a third-string quarterback can stay with the Bengals).
“Ohio State fans are the most annoying people on the planet. So you’ve got an entire state’s worth, of, uh, I don’t have a word that I can use on the air,” Palmer said. “What kills me living in Ohio is I have a Big Ten Network channel where I get all the Big Ten games. That’s like giving a My Little Pony rerun channel, that’s how much I want to watch the Big Ten games.”
While this doesn’t do anything to help Jordan Palmer’s image, I’m not concerned about these comments as a USC fan. But he prefaces all this taunting with one sentence:
“Our Trojans are going to wreak some havoc this week.”
Last time I checked, Jordan Palmer never attended USC. But by associating himself with the school, his harsh words and bold statements, coupled with his older brother’s statements last year, give USC the appearance of a classless, ill-mannered institution. That is not something that I want my team or school to symbolize.
There are ways to show school spirit or pride without torching the opponents, and the Palmers crossed the line. There was no need to bash Ohio State like they did. Ohio State has lost two BCS Championship games in the last three years by a combined 41 points, got outplayed by the Trojans last year in a 35-3 loss and its quarterback, Terrelle Pryor, recently had this to say when defending Michael Vick:
“I mean everyone kills people, murders people, steals from you, steals from me.”
So as you can see, Ohio State shoots itself in the foot enough already. Regardless, there’s no excuse for badmouthing other teams or institutions in a way that does nothing but bring them down. I have the utmost respect for Carson and Jordan Palmer, and, sure, they didn’t punch anyone, but their verbal jabs shouldn’t be used as examples for fellow Trojan fans to follow.
Wherever you plan on watching the game this weekend, have fun but be smart. Trojan fans are some of the most passionate fans around, and I encourage that. Do anything you have to do to show your enthusiasm for USC, just don’t beat up the Buckeyes.
Our football team will take care of that.

Looking to extend the nation’s longest winning streak to 34 games, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team takes the short road trip south to face off against No. 9 Long Beach State.
Following a successful Triton Invitational, in which the Trojans (4-0) captured the championship with relative ease, the Trojans will also be looking to extend another streak of their own, having won the past 15 straight matchups with the 49ers. The Trojans also hold a convincing 54-14 record all-time against the 49ers; including two victories last season by a combined 12 goals against the fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation team.
Intense drive · Driver Justin Rappel will look to help the Trojans  extend their 33-game winning streak against Long Beach State. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Last year’s 49ers team finished 14-18 overall including a 2-8 record in the very tough MPSF. Although LBSU was unable to finish with a winning record, they were able to capture tough wins against Pepperdine, Loyola Marymount, Bucknell and Princeton, all of whom are ranked among the nation’s best this season.
This year’s LBSU squad returns five starters, including top goal scorer senior center Jeff Greenwood and third-team All-MPSF goalie Dereck Weibe-Bailey. Both will be making their season debuts, as this weekend’s matchup with the Trojans will be the season opener for the 49ers squad that is led by third-year coach Gavin Arroyo.
Planning for an experienced and skilled goalie changes some of the preparation necessary leading up to the match, which senior two-meter and reigning Peter J. Cutino Award-winner J.W. Krumpholz, pays special attention to.
“We watch a lot of video [of the goalie],” Krumpholz said. “Assistant coach Marko Pintaric breaks down all of the shots on the goalkeeper from two-meter and from the outside.”
The team will hope to continue to spread the offense around against Weibe-Bailey, after 16 different Trojans scored to help USC light up the scoreboard last weekend at the Triton Invitational.
“Spreading the ball around is good early on,” Krumpholz said. “Because when it comes down to later games or harder games, not everyone is going to be able to score.”
After playing three top-20 teams in the Triton, continuing to play opponents of a high quality this early in the season gives the Trojans a chance to face off against the quality of team that USC are bound to see as the season progresses and teams hit their stride.
“[Playing top teams] helps us work out some kinks early on,” Krumpholz said. “We are trying to get everyone warmed up and ready to go.”
Although this is a non-conference matchup, the Trojans will be seeing the 49ers again later this season during MPSF conference play, at home on Oct. 17.
Also looking to continue his hot start to the season will be sophomore driver Peter Kurzeka. Kurzeka, who scored eight goals during the four-game Triton, was honored on Wednesday with the MPSF Player of the Week for the first week of the season, the first such award of his young career.

Something has to give.
When two of the county’s most well-known programs meet Saturday, each team will have reason for optimism.
USC is 25-1 in non-conference games since 2002, its lone blemish coming against Kansas State in USC coach Pete Carroll’s second year.
Proving point · True freshman quarterback Matt Barkley made it look easy against San Jose State last week, but the 19-year-old will have to show he can handle the pressure in front of 105,000 fans in Columbus, Ohio. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
Ohio State is undefeated in non-conference home games under head coach Jim Tressel.
With intersectional matchups between top teams becoming a dying breed, anticipation is at a high for Saturday’s game between No. 3 USC (1-0) and No. 8 Ohio State (1-0) at Ohio Stadium at 5 p.m.
More than 105,000 fans are expected to pack into “The Horseshoe” for ABC’s primetime game between the preseason favorites to win the Pac-10 and the Big Ten.
USC has won its last six games against Ohio State, including a 35-3 romp at the Coliseum last year, but the team expects to have its hands full against a hostile crowd on the road.
“We want to carry all of the same elements it takes to play well in that challenge,” USC coach Pete Carroll said earlier this week. “The difference in this game is really the noise.”
The trip to Columbus is expected to be the first true test for USC, which coasted to a 56-3 win against San Jose State in the opener last week at home. All eyes will be on true freshman Matt Barkley, who will start on the road at quarterback for the first time in his career in front of a volatile Buckeye crowd.
Crowd noise was pumped through loudspeakers in practice all week to prepare for the raucous venue. Beyond acclimating Barkley to the basics of going on the road, however, Carroll said the plan was to keep the status quo for his quarterback.
“I would think he’s going to have fun with it,” Carroll said. “He’s going to be excited to see what it looks like to be in an on opponent’s stadium of that stature and all. I don’t think it will matter to him at all.”
Ohio State narrowly escaped its opener against Navy last Saturday with a 31-27 win. The Midshipmen had a chance to tie the game with a little more than two minutes left in the fourth quarter, but an Ohio State linebacker intercepted the two-point conversion attempt and returned it for two points the other way.
The close call dropped the Buckeyes three spots in the polls.
“I thought we were playing fairly well to a certain degree and then we allowed some things to happen which turned it in to quite a football game,” Tressel said in a press conference.
Sophomore quarterback Terrelle Pryor has become the centerpiece of the Ohio State offense after an up-and-down freshman year. Pryor rotated with Todd Boeckman in last year’s game against USC, but neither was able to get into a rhythm and the Buckeyes attack lagged.
With new faces at receiver, running back and offensive line, Pryor will be depended upon to spark the Buckeyes with both his running and throwing ability.
Garrett Green has emulated Pryor for the Trojans in practice, but Carroll said that he has never had a player like the 6-foot-6 Pryor while at USC.
“This is a very, very unusual athlete to be this tall and this fast and have a great arm,” Carroll said. “I think you’ll see he’s not just a runner. He’s working hard to be an all-around quarterback.”
The return to Columbus is a welcome opportunity for Carroll, who coached at Ohio State in 1979 as an assistant. He cited FedExField in his 2004 match against Virginia Tech as the loudest stadium he has experienced as a college coach but noted he was looking forward to Saturday night’s atmosphere.
“It will be a big event for our young that haven’t been on the road before or in a situation like this,” Carroll said. “It’s an extraordinary place to play.”

Where were you the day the laughter died?
For me, it was summer of my senior year of high school when Chappelle’s Show began to die a prolonged death. Granted, the importance of Chappelle’s Show hit me retroactively; its creator can be accused of nothing if not equipping friends and classmates with a dozen lines for ad nauseum recitation. Once that personal stigma faded, however, I allowed myself to watch the show and found it to be as wonderful as an entire generation of Comedy Central-ites had.
At the time, Dave Chappelle’s decision to end his program after its second season was reminiscent of the rationale behind Ricky Gervais’ continuing impulse to prevent his TV comedies from overstaying their welcome. Certainly even Chappelle, who is on the short list of the funniest people of his generation, couldn’t sustain the level of genius that marked his show’s only two seasons.
But there was so much more to it than that. Chappelle — whose humor is partially rooted in the realm of racial stereotyping — lost sleep over the fact that his show might be reinforcing those very stereotypes in his demographically diverse audience.
Chappelle’s rationale for abandoning the most lucrative contract in television history — a decision undoubtedly coupled with intense pressure — cemented his reputation as more than a typical comedian: Chappelle is a man with a true social conscience. His refusal to air “lost episodes,” which are probably the most tone-deafly racist of his sketches, points strongly to the power of that conscience.
On the same end of the spectrum is Aaron McGruder — the highly political creator of a legendary comic about black life and politics called The Boondocks. I remember hearing McGruder speak to a student audience here at USC in those breathless weeks leading up to the 2008 presidential election. Judging from the first couple of questions, the group he addressed clearly hoped he would make a strong endorsement for the popular candidate of youths: Barack Obama.
Yet, the fiery young author said he didn’t find much of a difference between McCain and Obama — especially in light of their support for the controversial bailout bill, then still raw in the public mind. He said Obama had taken back the hope he had tried so hard to instill. As the disillusioned words of the far-Left pundit clashed with the hope and idealism of the audience, angry murmurs and walkouts ensued.
There’s no doubt that McGruder is bold. Who else could, through his acclaimed TV series based on his now defunct comic strip, so brilliantly resurrect Martin Luther King Jr. to offer comment on the state of black America? Who else would dare, in one staggering scene, to present one man’s vision of God as a cowboy Ronald Reagan clad in white?
Like Chappelle, much of McGruder’s humor deals with stereotypes.
Though when the same student moderator who pushed the defiant McGruder to offer an honest opinion of Obama asked him if he feared his program would reinforce negative stereotypes in the minds of the largely young, white audience that makes up a large piece of Adult Swim’s rating’s puzzle, McGruder evasively and shortsightedly answered that he simply didn’t think about things like that.
Now we can turn to Tyler Perry, one of America’s most financially successful black filmmakers.
Perry is an isolated force in the industry, someone far removed from the same obsessive fears about engendering racism that apparently tortured Chappelle and, for better or for worse, may someday also plague the indifferent McGruder. His films do not play outside of the community that he specifically addresses: black Americans. When critics speak up, they are dismissed as ignorant by fans or, such as in the extreme case of Roger Ebert, even deemed racist.
Perry has a freedom, whether he realizes it or not, that is provided by the isolating nature of his films. Certainly, his movies, like the works of his contemporaries, strike at the same basic human impulses when they play directly to a black audience. We laugh at Chappelle and McGruder’s comedy for reasons beyond the stereotypes. The same unifying reaction can be found in Perry’s work.
Part of me hopes that Perry’s audience will expand beyond the limited — yet lucrative — confines of black America. His films are merely yet another perspective by which a quintessentially American filmmaker views the world. That Perry is black is important to his work, but like those of Chappelle and McGruder, his films should not always be defined by their “black-ness.”
The works of Chappelle, McGruder and Perry require a constant defense against personal ignorance — vigilance against taking the racial stereotypes that these filmmakers propagate at face value.
If cinema is an exercise in viewing the world from another perspective, these three filmmakers represent a grand test in looking beyond the surface to find humor, entertainment and, ultimately, deep cultural value.

A seemingly happy marriage of more than 20 years ends with an adulterous wife who disappears, leaving her loving husband to discover the identity of her lover and travel across the country to befriend the man in order to gain justice.
The plot itself sounds like either a gut-wrenching, anti-love story or a psychologically jarring thriller — both of which would be wildly entertaining for their respective audiences. Unfortunately, Richard Eyre’s The Other Man is unable to choose between the two and ends up falling short. Even the film’s A-list cast is not enough to keep the film’s writing from sinking.
Love affair · Laura Linney stars alongside Antonio Banderas in The Other Man, a romance thriller from director Richard Eyre. Linney takes on the role of an adulterous wife, while Banderas plays her secret lover. - Photo courtesy of Image Entertainment
The film opens with a scene of tranquil water slowly turning into a wake behind a speedboat, accompanied by the soft sounds of an overdramatic melody. As the water splashes against the boat, we see a female hand playing with the water. The camera pans up to the smiling face of Lisa (Laura Linney), who is laughing and talking with someone off-camera.
As the camera turns around, a man (Antonio Banderas) we later learn is named Ralph (pronounced “Raff”), a self-described cosmopolitan, is smiling right back at her as he takes pictures and looks at her amorously. The love between these two is not unseen.
The next scene is a high-profile fashion show, in which Lisa is sitting next to a different man. Peter (Liam Neeson), her husband and owner of a computer company, sits obediently next to his wife in the front row of the runway, watching his wife’s famous shoes strut across the floor on models’ feet. Sitting on the other side of Lisa is her daughter, Abigail (Romola Garai).
In proper how-to-write-a-screen-play style, the minute the fashion show ends Abigail and Peter show their very strained relationship, seeming to catch Lisa in the middle. As Abigail leaves to meet up with her live-in boyfriend, George, Lisa and Peter head to dinner and engage in an awkward conversation about having sex with only one person for the rest of their lives. Peter seems to think it’s possible, but Lisa gives him room for doubt.
“It’s a choice, not a promise,” Lisa says after Peter explains his vow not to be with another woman.
Suddenly, the scene switches and Peter is cleaning out a room in his home when his daughter bursts in and tries to stop him. He attempts to give her the blankets and clothes in his hands and says that he can’t bear to have his wife’s things there anymore, suggesting that Lisa has left.
This event leads to the father and daughter exchanging in a hostile conversation, giving more evidence of their strained relationship. When the exasperated Peter sits at his desk to think, he realizes Lisa’s stunning pair of red heels are sitting on a bookshelf and finds a piece of paper with the words “Lake Como” on them. That’s when Abigail comes back in and explains that her mother told her to give them to him, but his look proves he does not understand the significance of Lake Como or the shoes.
It is not until he begins to look through her computer that he understands what Lake Como means. After some snooping through her computer, he comes across a folder entitled “Love” that is password protected. When he tries a folder named “Lake Como,” out spills hundreds of photos of Lisa with another man; some are platonic and some intimate, leaving Peter perplexed.
After a little illegal investigation, he finds the name of this man in the photos and where he lives — Milan. He proceeds to fly to they city and befriend the man who had been secretly intimate with his wife in order to enact some sort of vengeance.
The rest of the film follows a shaky — at best — attempt at a thrilling and twisting plotline, but seems to not quite pass the test. The writing seems to leave gaping holes that does not lead the audience to a “whodunit” chase but more of a confused stupor. Not being able to understand the plot in the middle is only an effective strategy if there is gratification at the end, but Eyre seems to miss this idea.
The casting and cinematography were clearly the saving graces of this film; from the high-profile leading actors to the very striking resemblance that Garai has to Linney. The dark, creepy scenes around the time Lisa disappears leaves a little more to the imagination than the writing.
Some stories are meant for the form in which they are created, and it seems that Eyre’s interpretation of The Other Man — coming from a short story — might not have translated over the medium of film as well as they would have liked. After all, with a cast as famous as this, the actors must have seen some magic spark on paper that made them interested in the film; it just didn’t come to life with the writing on the screen.

In the late 1920s, a clan of the silent film era’s most popular players, which included the likes of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford, embarked on an ambitious endeavor: to establish the world’s first film school.
After being turned down by several Ivy League schools, Fairbanks Sr., who was at the time the president of the newly created Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, took his proposal to the University of Southern California, the institution closest to Hollywood.
And on Feb. 6, 1929, USC held its inaugural cinema class, called Intro to Photoplay, with Fairbanks Sr. as the lecturer.
When reflecting on the School of Cinematic Arts’ not-so-humble beginnings, it is hardly a surprise that the school that was once comprised of rustic bungalows is now a sprawling, mini-metropolis of sorts that bears the names of Hollywood heavyweights George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, a bronze statue of Fairbanks Sr., as of Thursday, a square block of marble just outside the school’s massive gates that will have pedestrians believe they have stumbled upon a displaced portion of Hollywood’s Walk of Fame.
In celebration of the School of Cinematic Arts’ 80th anniversary, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce presented the school with a “star of recognition,” a distinction reserved solely for institutions. Though the star is a spitting image of those dotting the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard, it bears USC’s logo where a film reel or microphone would normally be placed.
Shooting stars · Dean Elizabeth Daley addresses alumni, students and faculty at the unveiling of the cinema school’s star Thursday. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
“A Walk of Fame star is only given to entertainers, so USC does not qualify,” explained Ana Martinez-Holler, vice president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. “A ‘star of recognition’ is an award for excellence. So far, less than 10 stars [of recognition] have been handed out­ — we don’t do this very often.”
Other institutions that have received this recognition include the Los Angeles Times, The Hollywood Reporter and Disneyland, the latter of which displays its star outside of the park’s main gates — much like the School of Cinematic Arts’ display of its own star.
“The star is to honor us because we’re the oldest film school in the country,” said Marlene Loadvine, senior dean of SCA external relations. “The Chamber also recognized that we continue to produce so many prominent people in the entertainment industry.”
Akin to how the School of Cinematic Arts has maintained its prestige for the past 80 years, the school received the commemorative star through a technique alumni have perfected throughout the years: networking, or what alumni, current students and faculty affectionately nicknamed the Trojan Mafia.
“One of our alums, Don Tillman, came up with the idea to celebrate the school’s 80th anniversary with a star,” Loadvine said. “It’s a very political process that takes about a year of going through applications and nominations.”
However political the process  might be, it also greatly helps that Tillman previously worked for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for 12 years.
“Tillman, who used to be on the Hollywood board, was the first to approach us about USC receiving a star,” Martinez-Holler said. “USC, really, is the first school because they are the only ones who’ve ever approached us … But I’m sure many more schools will be knocking at our door.”
Until then, the School of Cinematic Arts is milking its new precedent for all its worth.
The star’s official unveiling, which took place Thursday morning before the bronze eyes of Fairbanks Sr., was a quick yet well-stocked event that featured speeches from School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley and Hollywood Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leron Gubler, a performance from the Spirit of Troy marching band and an explosion of cardinal and gold confetti.
“More than anything, this event highlights the incredible talent, innovation and energy our alumni have brought to film,” Daley said. “For taking reality and reflecting it in new ways.”
Yet the star is not an emblem of USC’s devotion to the art form but a reminder of the school’s unwavering presence in all aspects of the studio system, a reminder that was further reinforced as theme songs from beloved blockbusters — such as Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Back to the Future — either directed or produced by USC alumni blared from large speakers set on the outskirts of the event. Notable alumni like John Singleton (Boyz n the Hood), Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey’s Anatomy) mingled with former Academy president Sid Ganis and members of the Hitchcock family. A reading of a list of award-winning alumni took up a majority of the event.
As Daley proceeded to describe the film school’s newest amenities, from the building’s old Hollywood throwback design to an in-house gallery displaying film cameras,  one cannot help but get the sense that as much as the School of Cinematic Arts is a premier institution, it is slowly morphing into a must-see Southern California attraction — and unabashedly so.
As Gubler stated in his speech minutes before the star’s unveiling: “USC and the Hollywood Walk of Fame are two of the most recognized icons of Southern California,”
Fairbanks Sr. sealed the School of Cinematic Arts’ fate as both a creative and business vehicle for aspiring film-minded talent the day he sat down with USC President Rufus B. von KleinSmid and collaborated on an unprecedented film institution.
Now, 80 years later with an extensive list of notable alumni and the school’s newest distinction of excellence cemented into the ground for all to see, it appears the School of Cinematic Arts won’t be leaving Hollywood anytime soon.

It is no secret that the United States is facing a great number of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. With the economy in the tank, a growing national deficit and a health care system more or less in flux, a huge problem in the country’s educational sector is going largely unnoticed.
In universities across the country, enrollment rates continue to grow as the iGeneration rides out the last wave of the echo boom; but while there is no shortage of applicants, the percentage of graduates is dipping rapidly. According to a New York Times article titled “Colleges are failing at graduation rates,” only half of all students who enroll in public universities graduate, making the United States second to only Italy in wealthy countries with poor follow-through.
Cheaper universities traditionally have lower graduation rates than more expensive ones. Inevitably, the elephant in the classroom emerges: Is a student’s wealth directly linked to his chances of wearing a mortarboard?
Ultimately, not really. However, William Bowen points out in his book, “Crossing the Finish Line,” that lower-income students are more likely to attend less-expensive universities, ones which do not place as strong an emphasis on graduating their students and cannot provide all the necessary resources for keeping them. (For example, availability of on-campus housing has been linked to higher graduation rates.)
In this way, the disparity between the higher and lower-income students continues to grow rapidly, helped along by the strains of the recession.
Schools like USC attempt to combat this gap by promising to meet any student’s designated need, and according to the USC Financial Aid website, 60 percent of students receive some sort of aid package. But boosting financial aid is not as feasible a possibility for universities (public or private) with smaller endowments, or for those whose endowments have been hit hard by the economic downturn.
Ultimately, it is the government’s job to intervene and President Barack Obama has already made steps in this direction. In mid-July he announced a $12 billion proposal to supplement public universities’ financial aid endowments, $2.5 billion of which would go toward vamping up the facilities at national community colleges.
Opponents of the plan point to the nation’s 9.5 percent unemployment rate and the rising national debt, though Obama said he plans to reallocate money from subsidies to college loan companies and banks.
In the melee of national crises, it’s easy to lambast a plan that doles out billions of dollars in subsidies. The fact remains, however, that bolstering education now is a good way to shorten the gap between economic classes and ensure for a financially viable future.
Education might not be an issue that involves death, sex or mortgage, but it is one that should be at the forefront of our attention. Obama’s bill is an important and necessary step in improving the educational system, and should be regarded as more than just pomp and circumstance.

Dear Republican Party,
I’m afraid things just aren’t working out between us anymore. Please don’t be alarmed by this. I know this is sudden but I have concerns that you may be losing your stability now that you’ve been out of power for nine months.
Leon Russo | Daily Trojan
Recently, your followers even went after the president for having a hidden socialist motif in his speech to children returning back to school. Where was the socialist agenda behind telling kids to study hard and do their part? It leaves me wondering if you even know what a socialist really is when you’re launching wild accusations left and right.
There was a time when being a Republican meant you stood for personal responsibility and individual freedoms in addition to lower taxes and smaller government, but now, thanks to your failure to cooperate in Congress, I’m not sure what you stand for anymore. I understand you were left in disarray after losing the election, but rather than regrouping to develop a new stance fit to match the needs of a changing political landscape, you fumbled back with the same conservative agenda, leaving me more than a little confused.
Would you support a federal stimulus package to assist ailing American industries? No. Apparently, the market will fix itself. That must be why the unemployment rates jumped to a 26-year high at 9.7 percent this August.
Would you support clean-energy bills that promote clean-tech investments? Not that either, I guess. Instead, you seem insistent on making sure our energy policies keep us in the Stone Age. Sponsors of the recent climate/energy bill had to double their efforts on passing the cap-and-trade legislation because you — surprise — refused to cooperate. It’s clear that there needs to be a price on carbon emission to encourage private investments in clean energy and energy efficiency, yet you continue to preach drilling as the answer.
How about agreeing upon health care reform to help cover the 46 million Americans who are currently without health insurance? Instead of accepting Obama’s proposition for a bipartisan approach on health care and leverage on the public option, you laughed as the president delivered his speech to Congress, and interrupted him to call him a liar when he assured that his health care plan would not cover illegal immigrants. Very mature of you, considering the $900-billion plan would cost less than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wars you got us into. Of course no one wants to pay for the bill when you insist that it undermines the private sector and that insured citizens could face changes to their health plan under the president’s proposal.
I can only reiterate what Obama himself said in his joint conference address: “I will not stand by while the special interests use the same old tactics to keep things exactly the way they are. If you misrepresent what’s in the plan, we will call you out.”
It’s hard to believe you’ve fallen so far from your storied lineage that once begot great leaders such as Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, who were more than capable of guiding the country through difficult times. Your leaders today, however, have failed to show that type of leadership. Your political stance of simply opposing any propositions made by Democrats is failing the nation.
Now is the time for bipartisanship, yet I’m forced to watch you act like a toddler that always has to have it his way. Under our current circumstances, I can’t afford to sit around and wait for you to settle your differences with the Democrats any longer. This country will move forward with or without you.
All I can offer you now is my condolences on the loss of your identity.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Friday, Sept. 4 and Thursday, Sept. 10.
Crimes against a person
At 4:50 p.m. on Sept. 8, a student reported that her roommate, also a student, threw a bag of cleaning supplies at her chest during an argument, knocking the wind out of her.  The reporting student said she feared for her safety  and planned to relocate.
at 9:07 p.m. on Sept. 8, DPS officers responded to a student who reported that she was assaulted by her boyfriend, also a student.  Officers observed that the student had a cut to her wrist and she said it occurred while her boyfriend pushed her around the bedroom during an argument.  The student stated there were two previous  unreported incidents in which her boyfriend burned her with a cigarette and she showed the officers scars that were consistent with her statement.  The boyfriend was detained by LAPD officers, arrested and transported to the Southwest station for booking.
Crimes against property
at 11:08 a.m. on Sept. 4, Retail Unit officers monitoring surveillance cameras at Pertusati University Bookstore observed a student pick up a textbook, unwrap it and remove the online registration code before replacing the book.  The officers detained the student when he exited and he was taken into custody.  The student was arrested and booked.
at 6:41 p.m. on Sept. 4, a student reported losing a wallet at the University Village.  The wallet was subsequently turned in to lost and found and returned to the student, but all of her credit cards were missing.
At 1:27 p.m. on Sept. 8,  a student reported that while she was attending a dance in Marina Del Rey, a suspect removed her wallet and a camera from her purse.

Despite opposition from Los Angeles County and other cities, the California State Assembly approved a proposal Friday to waive environmental laws for a planned NFL stadium in Los Angeles.
The measure, which was approved by a vote of 55 to 17, will spare Majestic Realty Co., chaired by USC Trustee Edward Roski Jr., from adhering to various portions of the California Environmental Quality Act when building the proposed 75,000-seat structure in the City of Industry.
Lobbyists for Los Angeles County were ordered Tuesday to work against the bill, and nearby cities, such as Walnut, also promised opposition to the proposal, citing traffic impacts and other environmental issues, according to the Associated Press.
The measure will now move on to the State Senate for further consideration.

“Hi, I’m Paul and I’m an alcoholic.”
“Hi Paul,” the attendees greeted in unison.
At Wednesday night’s Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, six recovering addicts took turns sharing stories of their struggles to overcome alcoholism and drug addiction. The meeting — the second weekly meeting at USC after a hiatus of more than two years — began at 6 p.m. in University Religious Center room 205 with the reading of the AA preamble.  Together, the members recited the Serenity Prayer.
“God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”
Paul S., a senior majoring in health sciences, attended his first AA meeting three years ago at USC. He explained that unlike other addicts, he had no legitimate reason to start drinking alcohol.
Anonymous · Recovering alcoholics meet at the University Religious Center once per week to share their struggles in overcoming addiction. USC has not hosted regular meetings in more than two years. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
“I come from this perfect Leave it to Beaver family and Beaver’s got a drinking problem,” he said. “My mom is the sweetest person — she makes Martha Stewart look like an amateur. There was nothing that made me start drinking.”
During his childhood, Paul’s family often added wine to their drinks as a Croatian cultural tradition, he said. As he got older, Paul began to understand that the good feeling, which came with consuming those drinks, was because of the alcohol mixed in.
“The last time my drinking was pure was when I was 9 years old,” he said. “After that, I was sneaking into the liquor cabinet.”
Paul said he started drinking and smoking marijuana every day. He also took pills every day when he began working at a pharmacy.
He reached his “bottom” — the low point in which he realized he needed help — when he was regularly injecting heroin to the frequency that his parents began noticing it. Yet he did not want to become sober, he said.
“The only reason I got sober is because I started going to the AA meetings that [my rehabilitation center] told me to,” he said. “I’ve been sober almost five years now … I’m really grateful to be sober. I mean it.”
Wednesday’s meeting was the second AA meeting USC has hosted this year. Several years ago, AA meetings existed on campus but the program disappeared until this semester.
The USC Office of Religious Life recently revived the meetings, though the office is not involved in the program. The office solely provides a location for the meetings and the staff does not sit in on meetings or necessarily know the students who attend.
Unlike most groups on campus, there is no one leader at the AA meetings. Each member is able to vocalize his stories equally, and as one member tells his story, the group is silent and listens.
Also, because USC provides a location for meetings, students do not need to pay any fees to come, nor must they sign up to join. Meetings are open to both students and non-USC attendees. Donations are optional and recovering addicts are allowed to attend whenever they want, without inquiry. The program accepts donations so that members can provide coffee or food at some meetings. In other AA meetings around the world, groups collect donations in order to pay for minimal costs, such as toilet paper in the bathrooms or food; however, dues are never required at any AA meeting.
Associate Dean of the Office of Religious Life Jim Burklo said that he expects many students to attend the meetings.
“We’re going to have a lot of alcoholics. It’s true in any university,” he said. “AA is a very powerful, spiritually grounded program for maintaining sobriety. It’s not a magic pill … But it’s great for people trying to maintain sobriety.”
Anthony B., 39, another AA member, said he was homeless at one point because he spent all his money on drugs.
He said he initially challenged the AA’s principles and attempted to prove them wrong because he did not believe that they would be effective. He finally decided to try out AA, he said, because he preferred his AA peers’ lifestyles to his own.
“It was hell where I was. I don’t ever want to go back there,” he said.
A junior majoring in mathematics and economics who helped bring AA meetings back to USC, and who preferred to remain unnamed, said AA is based on a 12-step process that helps develop a relationship with a higher power. Members put their faith in a higher power to end their obsession of drugs and alcohol.
The junior attends meetings all across Los Angeles and said each meeting usually ranges in attendance anywhere from three to 500 people. More than 3,000 registered meetings take place in Los Angeles per week, he said.
“A meeting is a collection of people with the common goal of staying sober today, that meet together and share their experience, strength, and hope,” he said. “[AA] is very surrounded around a spiritual source to keep us sober.”
AA meetings are held in URC 205 on Mondays from noon to
1 p.m. and on Wednesdays from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Though the Trojans will be far away, students will be able to see Taylor Mays up close and in 3-D Saturday night  — but some aren’t sure that’s a good thing.
During the Ohio State vs. USC football game tomorrow, the Galen Center will be turned into a 3-D movie theater, complete with 3-D glasses.
“It’s going to look a lot like the HD graphics on normal TV,” said Anthony Bailey, vice president of emerging technologies for ESPN. “But when something is coming towards a low-lying camera, it will look like it’s right in front of you.”
USC partnered with ESPN to provide the 3-D broadcast. As it is a new technology, ESPN will use Saturday’s event to help gauge fans interest in watching sports in 3-D.
“It’s an intriguing matchup between USC vs. Ohio and it would provide a good opportunity to test during a premier game,” said Colleen Lynch, associate communications manager for ESPN.
For the event, the Galen Center will put up three screens, each 40-feet wide and almost 23-feet tall. The three screens will form a U-shape around the video board hanging in the center of the arena, Bailey said.
In addition to the 2-D broadcast from the field, seven 3-D cameras will also send feeds to the Galen Center screens.
ESPN has been researching 3-D broadcasting for the past two years, Lynch said. They are waiting to see how people respond to this broadcast before they make any long-term decisions about how 3-D technology will be used in the future.
All of the roughly 6,000 tickets for the event have been given out. Tickets were free and distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis, but 1,200 were reserved for USC students, said Craig Kelley, assistant director of marketing for USC’s athletic department
While some students were excited by the broadcast, others said they weren’t convinced the 3-D showing will enhance the viewing experience.
“I think it will be good,” said Elise Welch, a junior majoring in psychology. “I have always been critical of 3-D, but I have heard there have been improvements, so I’m excited to see it.”
However, Welch said the 3-D element may make the game more difficult to understand.
Samantha Klein, a junior majoring in fine arts, said she plans to attend the screening, partly because she has never seen a 3-D event before.
“I’m curious to see what they do with it in the context of a sports game,” Klein said.
Tara Marquez, a junior majoring in philosophy, law and politics, said the large screens and action of the game might make following the play distracting.
“There might be too much going on on the screen,” Marquez said.
Matt Broaddus, a junior majoring in English who describes himself as a lifelong football fan was also a bit hesitant.
Broaddus said he does not plan to go to the 3-D broadcast. Instead, he will watch the game on normal TV.
“It’s kind of interesting,” he said. “At the same time, it’s kind of weird. I’m apprehensive about it. It’s so different that it kind of turns me off.”
