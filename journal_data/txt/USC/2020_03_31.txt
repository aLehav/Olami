Hosted by Elton John, the iHeart Living Room Concert for America aired on Fox Sunday evening as coronavirus cases surged globally. Throughout the night, performers popped in to provide relief in the form of entertainment and shared their comforting words for the world.
John opened the concert with a touching message for the audience. 
“There’s a lot of grief out there, uncertainty and fear, but let me tell you what’s going to keep us together,” he said. “All the goodness that’s still happening in the world — those doctors, nurses and scientists on the front lines — they’re living proof that most superheroes don’t wear capes. It’s inspiring that once we get through these tough times, better days lie ahead.” 
Celebrities from all facets of entertainment such as Russel Wilson, Ciara, Lady Gaga, Lizzo, Melissa McCarthy and Ellen DeGeneres were also present, sharing their support and reminding viewers to donate to First Responders Children’s Foundation and Feeding America. 
Alicia Keys began her intimate performance casually dressed and sitting at a deep-purple piano in her home. She sang her recently released power-ballad “Underdog.” The version she performed over the weekend was stripped-down with an emotional tone that her genuine, warm voice brought beauty to.  
As if the melody didn’t speak for itself, Keys changed the lyrics to fit the occasion and sang to at-home audiences “She’s riding in a taxi back to the kitchen / Talking to the driver ’bout his children and wife / A first responder who was risking her life / To give us her love and give it right on time.” 
This rendition was a hopeful one, fitting for the evening. 
Next on the screen were the Backstreet Boys, reunited. The group performed an energetic living-room rendition of their classic song “I Want It That Way.” Each joining in from their respective homes, one couldn’t help but to get up, dance and sing along. 
Keeping it fun and lighthearted, a few band members brought in their kids for backup. Their performance brought old and new fans together through television screens.
Relaxed in a baseball cap and sweats, Billie Eilish and her brother-producer Finneas took to the stage from their living room sofa. The two sang “Bad Guy” from her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?”
Eilish’s soft voice was accompanied by Finneas’ rhythm-keeping on his guitar and deep-toned background vocals. Before beginning her set, Billie sent her love to audiences.
“Love to you, your families, your loved ones, everybody,” she said. “Let’s stay strong together. Take care.”
After a slew of other performances, John closed the evening with “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” played on his son’s keyboard. With a strong, renowned voice, the power of John’s lyrics traveled far. He sang: “Don’t let the sun go down on me / Although I search myself, it’s always someone else that I see.”  
A master of the piano, John delivered a short performance with a powerful message resonating with viewers around the nation. 
With the concert, listeners and celebrities together were able to raise nearly $8 million in donations to First Responders Children’s Foundation and Feeding America. While social distancing, hosting an event like this brought people together and created a sense of unity amid the chaos.

Defining a hit song or approximating the formula for a timeless record is nearly impossible. Yes, pop songs are flooding the airwaves with identical arrangements and catchy hooks, but not every record that emulates the last No. 1 single is a guaranteed success. 
As someone who grew up in the 2000s, listening to every R&B album I could get my hands on — “The Emancipation of Mimi,” “B’Day,” “Trey Day” and the list goes on — I know that there are two men (among others) who most certainly have the formula for a hit record: Ne-Yo and Johntá Austin. 
Following previous Instagram Live beat and songwriting battles, such as the ones between The-Dream vs. Sean Garrett and the originators’ Swizz Beatz vs. Timbaland, the two R&B legends went hit for hit Sunday trying to one-up each other with their classic records.
There’s a lot to be deciphered from these battles but most notably that Austin is a criminally underrated songwriting prodigy,
Opening the battle with Tyrese’s “Sweet Lady” it was revealed to me in Instagram Live comments and on Twitter that he wrote the record at the tender age of 15. I did some digging, and the Atlanta native also wrote Toni Braxton’s classic “Just Be a Man About It” and the Aayliah favorite “I Don’t Wanna,” one of the few available on streaming services, before he was old enough to legally consume alcohol. 
Interestingly enough, many of the records Austin penned at such a young age are often categorized as “grown” and “sexy music.” They are ballads that would usually be heard on an urban radio station’s “quiet storm” format or during the tail-end of a summer cookout. 
When I think of other artists who produced such vulnerable music in their youth, more famous names come to mind. Stevie Wonder wrote and co-wrote many songs at a young age, my favorite being Smokey Robinson and the Miracle’s “The Tears of a Clown” at age 17. Adele’s debut single, “Hometown Glory,” the first song she ever wrote, was penned at just 16 years old. 
Although Austin’s solo music hasn’t taken off in the way Ne-Yo’s did, Sunday night’s battle showed us that his writing catalog is extensive. He devoured his competition with Mariah Carey’s “We Belong Together” and Mary J. Blige’s “Be Without You,” the record Billboard ranked as the most successful R&B/Hip-Hop Song of all time. 
Secondly, what I gathered from the conversation was how simple but effective Ne-Yo’s songwriting is. “You look so dumb right now,” is arguably one of the most basic opening lines in history, but it works for Rihanna’s “Take A Bow.” In Ne-Yo’s writing, there are few double entendres or intensely metaphoric verses found today in the songs of Frank Ocean or NAO.Instead, he writes experiences — ones directly translatable to music videos and conversations on love to be had among girlfriends. My favorite, the hook he sang on Plies’ “Bust It Baby, Pt. 2,” instantly places me in the passenger seat of some guy’s car up to no good. I’ll leave it at that.
Today, there a few artists like Ne-Yo who can bounce vocals from song to song all while leaving a lasting impression on each; his hooks are undeniably great. From Ghostface’s “Back Like That,” Fabolous’ “Make Me Better” to the karaoke ballad “Hate That I Love You,” his crooning and writing are more than just catchy, and you can pinpoint an exact vibe for each song he’s featured on. 
Listening to “Come through the block in the brand new Benz” on the Xtreme-produced “Back Like That,” feels like being an audience member on “106 & Park.” It’s like he wrote directly for music video countdowns and middle school gym dances. 
The final lesson solidified by the Ne-Yo vs. Johntá Austin battle was what I miss about the genre as a whole. R&B has its unique marks and particular styles but crosses over to and plays with pop and hip-hop all the time, and that’s what made it fun and exciting in the late ’90s and early 2000s. 
Although they still exist, rap-sung collaborations aren’t as popular or simply good as they used to be — take Drake’s “Hotline Bling” winning the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance. Where is the dynamic between vocalist and emcee? I can’t two-step to it, and I can’t imagine Rocsi and Terrence J rightfully garnering the attention of listeners or introducing it as a No.1 video on “106 & Park” without cringing. 
Rappers today make pseudo-R&B records, but not ones that compliment the genre enough to lend to a successful collaboration with R&B’s artists. It’s as if they want to be the next Ne-Yo and not work with him. 
And although I love today’s R&B artists in their own right, the music can be almost too introspective to produce a radio hit. Records like Mario’s “Let Me Love You,” the eighth most successful single of the decade as ranked by Billboard, simply do not exist. 
In an early iteration of “Everything but the Song,” I wrote about how R&B is not dead, naming several of today’s overlooked talents. The genre isn’t lifeless, but it certainly is not as wide-reaching as it used to be. With more than 70,000 people glued to their phone screens to hear two producers (not artists, but producers), the battle is a testimony not only to the power of music but to the culture of R&B that once was. 
I applaud Timbaland and Swizz Beats for bringing R&B lovers together over Instagram Live with these exciting matchups. In lieu of actual concerts, they serve as a break from the horrors of the coronavirus pandemic, an opportunity to give the people behind the music their flowers and a reminder that music brings people together.

I was 12 years old when right fielder Ichiro Suzuki was traded from the Seattle Mariners to the New York Yankees. I didn’t keep up with sports news at the time, but the sense of betrayal I felt when I saw the player who had been playing for the Mariners all my life in a Yankees jersey was overwhelming.
The loss of such a big name in Northwest sports was tough, and that’s why I can’t imagine what it will be like for New England Patriots fans to see Tom Brady suit up as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer.
In an unprecedented time when nearly every league had already suspended or canceled play due to the coronavirus, the news of Brady’s departure from his team of 20 years was perhaps just as unfathomable for those who grew up watching him play.
Although fans knew Brady’s contract was ending, that didn’t make it any easier when he announced his decision to leave the team on Twitter. Brady was flooded with positive messages about his legacy, but there were also many fans who wondered why he would choose to spend the last years of his storied career anywhere other than Foxborough.
One user commented, “Stop it. Retire. For the love of god, stop Favreing,” comparing Brady to quarterback Brett Favre, who came out of retirement three times before officially calling it quits at age 41. Like Brady, Favre spent the majority of his career with a single team — the Green Bay Packers — before short stints with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings.
Beyond leaving his longtime franchise, the move can be a risky one for Brady’s continued success as a player. If he wants his seventh ring, he might not earn it on a Bucs squad that went 7-9 last season and faces tough competition in the NFC.
Brady has been part of the same winning formula for two decades under head coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft, so the traditionally more cautious quarterback’s play under Bucs head coach Bruce Arians is sure to be an intriguing storyline.
Overall, though, Brady’s decision to leave at this point in his career serves a mutual benefit to both him and New England. And I’m not just saying he made the right choice because I’m tired of the Brady-Belichick combo beating my Pittsburgh Steelers.
For a team that reached the AFC Championship in eight consecutive years, losing in the 2019 Wild Card had to be a major letdown, especially given that Brady’s last throw was a pick-6. The Brady-led Patriots squad trended downward last year, starting out a perfect 8-0 before going 4-4 to end the regular season.
I’m not pinning the Patriots’ turnaround entirely on Brady by any means, but this Patriots team appeared very different from the powerhouse we’ve grown accustomed to seeing. When that happens and your quarterback is 42 years old with an expiring contract, it makes sense for the franchise to make some changes.
The Bucs offer Brady an exciting new challenge. Shockingly enough, Brady actually pitched himself to Arians and Bucs general manager Jason Licht, and it makes sense if you think about it. The Bucs haven’t made the postseason since 2007, but Brady will surely take advantage of their receiving corps. He now has the opportunity to see what he can do for a franchise that doesn’t have it all figured out yet.
Brady also has little to lose, which is something that can’t be said for Belichick and the Patriots. Struggling for a small-market team wouldn’t put him under nearly as much fire as struggling for the traditionally top-tier Patriots.
There is always the possibility that Brady’s numbers continue to decline and that he misses the playoffs for the first time since 2008. There are always critics who insist that a 42-year-old has no business continuing to play football, and maybe they’re right.
But whether Brady goes 0-16 or 16-0 with the Bucs, his legacy with the Patriots won’t change. 
Whether you love him or hate him and whether you love or hate his decision, let Tom Brady go out how he wants to — he’s given the league 20 of the best seasons it has ever seen from a player.

Despite having its Pac-12 Tournament and March Madness hopes cut short by the coronavirus pandemic, the USC men’s basketball team has maintained its strong presence on the recruiting trail for the 2020 and 2021 seasons.
The Trojans landed two top-eight California recruits — four-star shooting guards Reese Dixon-Waters of St. Bernard and Malik Thomas of Damien, who committed to USC last week. 
Although it is early, USC now has the No. 1 recruiting class for 2021. Dixon-Waters and Thomas will join Mater Dei center Harrison Hornery in the class.
Dixon-Waters announced his commitment to USC in a video posted to his social media accounts last Tuesday, and Thomas announced his commitment online via the Compton Magic’s Twitter account three days later.
“As a kid, USC was my dream school,” Dixon-Waters said per 247Sports. “I always wanted to go there. It’s closer to home so my family can be at every home game, and I love the school coaches.”
In addition, Wofford junior forward Chevez Goodwin, Santa Clara junior guard Tahj Eaddy and Utah Valley junior guard Isaiah White announced their transfers to USC last week, joining three-star center Boubacar Coulibaly of San Gabriel Academy on the long list of March additions to the Trojans’ 2020 roster.
“Academically [USC] has what I want to major in,” Goodwin said per 247Sports. “That was big. Then coach [Andy] Enfield has a plan for me. He wants me to play for him and knows exactly how I play and how he wants to get me better. It was all genuine.”
USC is still awaiting decisions from Jalen Green, Ziaire Williams, Greg Brown, Joshua Christopher and Makur Maker, all of whom are top-12 recruits nationally in the Class of 2020. Williams — the No. 5 player in the nation — will likely be at the top of USC’s list, as the Sierra Canyon shooting guard has USC in his top six along with Arizona, Stanford, North Carolina, UCLA and Oregon.
USC will be keeping a close eye on Moussa Cisse, Kennedy Chandler and Zaon Collins in hopes to add onto their already-impressive 2021 class.
The Trojans’ 2018 and 2019 recruiting classes ranked 18th and 7th respectively in the nation per 247Sports. The 2020 class is not repeating as a top-20 national finish thus far as USC currently sits in 50th place, but the incoming class is far from a disappointment.
Headlining the 2020 class is five-star center Evan Mobley from Rancho Christian in Temecula. Mobley is listed as the No. 2 player in the country behind Oklahoma State commit Cade Cunningham. The two, along with Emoni Bates of Lincoln High School in Ypsilanti, Mich., were named finalists for the 2019-20 Gatorade National Boys Basketball Player of the Year award.
The cancellations of the Pac-12 and NCAA tournaments cut USC’s opportunities to prove itself short this season, but the USC coaching staff and athletic director Mike Bohn are looking forward to the bright future USC basketball seems to have in store as the Trojans attract top recruits from across the country.

The New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta sat down with a handful of faculty and around 30 students to discuss writing profiles, the news industry and media bias Monday night. The speaker joined as a guest for Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Mary Murphy’s “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” class via Zoom. 
Auletta’s works include profiles of Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner, the last of which won him the National Magazine Award in 2001. Outside of his time at The New Yorker, Auletta has written five national bestsellers. 
A substantial part of the discussion revolved around the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault cases in 2017, and the knowledge Auletta gained as a reporter investigating the topic. After some information about survivors reached Auletta in 2002, he confronted Weinstein in an interview. 
“I said, ‘Mr. Weistein, tell me about Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins,’” Auletta said. “He said, ‘What do you mean?’ I said, ‘Is it true that you attempted to rape Rowena Chiu and that Zelda Perkins later came to her aid, and they sued you, and you signed non-disclosure agreements with them and paid them a total of £125,000?’ … And at that point, Harvey just started to cry. He said if you run that story, it will destroy my marriage. And my three young daughters who are preteens, it will destroy their lives.”
Auletta and his editor at the time, David Remnick, decided that the story could not be published since the women wanted to remain anonymous. However, that changed in 2017 with the work of his colleague Ronan Farrow. 
“[Farrow] actually had three women on camera by name [and] five women on camera, but shielded,” Auletta said. “And he had an audio tape of an Italian model who Harvey allegedly grabbed her breasts, but on tape he admitted he had. I said, ‘My God, you cracked the code.’”
After NBC turned the story down, Auletta recommended the story to Remnick. Farrow’s report was published six weeks later.
The Weinstein profile released by both The New Yorker and The New York Times, just five days apart, sparked a conversation about how the different stories complemented rather than competed with one another.
“They were generous to each other,” Auletta said. “They’re different kinds of stories and both led to the same thing: an exposure to someone who had raped and abused women and got away with it for many, many years.”
The conversation took a turn away from Weinstein toward President Donald Trump, the media and biased news. Murphy questioned the effects of a standoff between Trump and the news and how the phenomenon may harm or benefit the media.
Auletta said Trump has been given more attention to the news because it attracts more viewers. He noted that news companies frame Trump in a way that their viewership wants to see him, either bashed or praised. 
“I don’t think we should be covering his daily briefings on the coronavirus when it’s basically just a standup routine for him,” Auletta said. “We should be hearing from scientists. And he just allows them on for a few minutes and then goes back to his rants and, oftentimes, fake information.”
He also commented on how the polarization of news in our current system affected the reporting about the virus.
“It is really distressing that people cannot agree on common sets of facts,” Auletta said. “For many months, you had people on Fox News saying the coronavirus was a hoax. It was fake news. And that set back our ability to marshall our forces to combat it.”
Afterwards, the class opened up to a Q&A portion where Autella addressed whether he believes reporters work on bias, passion or both. 
“You can be passionate about something and not be biased,” Auletta said. “You say, ‘I’m going to write about the environment, I’m going to write what’s really happening, I’m going to go to the coal industry.’ You might have opinions about how coal is harmful, but if you’re a fair-minded reporter who’s interested in facts, you’re also going to say, ‘What happens to the coal miners if you get rid of coal?’ And that’s not a biased story, that’s writing the truth.”
Mandi Mikasa, a freshman majoring in communication, said she appreciated Auletta’s anecdotes regarding the Weinstein report and his outlook on the current news cycle. 
“I really valued his opinions on everything that’s going on right now, especially the answer to my question about how [the coronavirus] is affecting the economy and how we’ll recover from that slowly but surely,” Mikasa said.

Recently, USC took some flak as the school’s Investment Office disclosed that five percent of its endowment is in the fossil fuel industry, totaling an estimated $277 million. 
President Carol Folt has said that divesting fossil fuel assets is important to her in response to student rallies. However, there has been no publicly known action on the issue thus far. 
Along with divesting from fossil fuel investments, USC can take another step to stave off climate change. As a major private research university, USC is a leader in the community and can both make and encourage environmental change by working with the city of Los Angeles and setting a goal to reach 100% renewable energy within the near future.
To its credit, USC has made forward strides from a sustainability standpoint in the last few years. It has installed solar panels on facilities across its campuses, including on top of Galen Center and at the Wrigley Marine Science Center on Catalina Island. It has also invested $6.5 million in installing LED lighting across campus, which is expected to lead to a 40% reduction in lighting energy use. The school also has five LEED certified buildings on its campuses. 
The University’s combined efforts have led to a 33% greenhouse gas emissions reduction between 2014 and 2019. Furthermore, the university has a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 100% by 2040.
The University of Utah, a public institution with an endowment of $1.225 billion, went from 4.6% renewable energy to 53.7% this past November from just a single energy deal with a geothermal plant. The school has also been working on a solar deal which will increase the 53.7% figure to 71%.
Similar energy deals will certainly be affordable for USC. The University has an endowment nearly five times the size of Utah’s, and Utah’s administration said the amount the school is paying for renewable energy is “comparable” to what it had paid for other forms of electricity. From a financial perspective, completely transitioning to sustainable energy now will pay off over the long term both economically and in reputation. 
So why not aim higher as well as take the lead on the issue? Although the number is oft-disputed, many scientists and researchers, including the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, say we have about a 10-year window to lower greenhouse gas emissions if warming temperatures are to be controlled. 
Climate change is an urgent issue and USC is positioned to make an impact by going fully renewable within the next decade. Furthermore, the University can look to partner with L.A.’s public and private sectors to become an outspoken leader on initiatives for lowering greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable sources of energy. An academic institution priding itself on progressive, dynamic thinking combined with cutting-edge research and innovation is the perfect candidate to lead by example when it comes to sustainability.
USC should see the outcry over its fossil fuel investments as an opportunity. With enough commitment, the University has the resources to quickly position itself at the forefront of environmental reform through action and leadership.

It feels like we’re heading into a tunnel. Rome has closed its churches. Disneyland has closed its doors indefinitely. Schools are empty. Everything is canceled.  
This is an unprecedented moment in our lives –– even the swine flu in 2009, which claimed 12,469 lives  in the United States, didn’t cause this level of social debilitation. Recognize that we are living through history. 
And if history will remember anything from this moment, it will be the ways in which our leaders have failed us. 
The time the U.S. government had to prepare was squandered by its lethargic reaction. We cannot blame the lack of testing exclusively on President Donald Trump, as there was a host of bureaucratic and logistical problems and disagreements that slowed the process of procuring testing kits. 
That being said, his decision early on to undervalue the threat is largely responsible for our late reaction. He called the coronavirus a Democratic “hoax” as recently as Feb. 28. 
And so the virus was allowed to spread in silence for six weeks, and as a result, the United States has the worst infection trajectory of any advanced country. Our lack of early response has caused untold economic disruption, and more importantly, it has cost lives. 
But it’s the lack of moral leadership that leaves us without a much-needed signpost. In Trump’s national address on March 13, he stuttered through lies about firing the pandemic office and the availability of testing and even referenced a Google coronavirus website that did not exist. 
“I don’t take responsibility at all,” our leader has said. 
And so the responsibility is left to the people. We have the power to “flatten the curve” of infection rates, and we do this by distancing ourselves, by spending time away from the people and pastimes that we love. 
While this will be easy for no one, it is catastrophic for the economically vulnerable members of our society. The virus has illuminated all the ways in which our institutions are broken. Our profit-driven health care system has charged people thousands of dollars for testing. Not only does this punish those who take the responsible course of action, but it places a heavy disincentive on getting the tests that can save lives.
Sadly, there are few who can afford to take weeks off work to self-quarantine, and we are left wondering why paid sick leave isn’t the norm outside of these circumstances and why we must live without social safety nets while the economy breaks records every year. 
Even in the midst of a crisis, relief has been stalled by partisanship. On March 25, four Republican senators delayed a stimulus bill on the grounds that it was too generous to unemployed U.S. workers. They objected to the fact that some low-wage workers might receive more in unemployment than in their typical paychecks. 
Their arguments skimmed over the reason for this increase: Unemployment benefits in the United States are not enough to keep a family above the poverty line.
But this is not business as usual –– not in the least. We should prepare to deal with the outbreak over the next several months, but it will only be as severe as we allow it to be. By sacrificing our time in the sun, we can take steam out of the engine that is exponential growth. 
When the dust settles, we should choose to take lessons from this experience, to try and repair the holes in our institutions made visible by this disease. Viruses tend to recur; if we don’t make the necessary adjustments, we’ll be no less vulnerable when the next crisis hits.    
This will be a difficult time, no doubt, but it’s the kind of challenge that defines a generation. Remember that the struggle of living through a pandemic is not for nothing. The young and healthy may not be at high risk of dying, but there are countless more who rely on their decisions. By taking time off work or going home for a semester, you are saving someone you may not even know. 
So good luck, stay safe and remember to wash your hands.

Inspired by his life research in retinal prosthesis, co-director of the Roski Eye Institute Mark Humayun is in the early stages of developing retinal contacts that could prevent or slow down vision loss. Humayun, along with a team of experts that includes Keck School of Medicine Provost Gianluca Lazzi and assistant professor of translational genomics Bodour Salhia, won an award of nearly $2 million from the National Science Foundation Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation to further research on the contacts.
As a Keck professor of ophthalmology and director of the USC Ginsburg Institute for Biomedical Therapeutics, Humayun’s idea for retinal contacts came from his prior work in vision restoration. Humayun invented Argus II retinal prosthesis systems, an implant behind the eye that helps restore vision to blind patients with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder where the retinal cells at the back of the eye start to break down and become damaged.
“[The grant] led us to consider this approach … to try a controlled electrical stimulation to see if we could slow down or even prevent vision loss from certain types of retinal degeneration and retinal diseases,” Humayun said.
The purpose of retinal research and lens device creation is to develop preventative measures for patients who are at risk of becoming blind from these diseases, whereas the Argus II treats patients after they’ve already gone blind. The team of experts plans to continue this in their research funded by the grant. 
“The first step is to really demonstrate whether true utilization of this device through electrical stimulation will in fact result in meaningful slowing of neuron loss,” Lazzi said. 
The device also induces indirect electrical pulses that activate the remaining neurons in the retina. After working with Lazzi and finishing final tests, Humayun trained numerous surgeons on how to properly install the Argus II implant behind the eye. Approved by the Federal Drug Administration in 2013, the system became the first approved artificial retina system and has been commercially released through Second Sight, a medical prosthetics company for neurostimulation devices. 
For more than 20 years, Lazzi has been part of the development team for Argus II’s hardware, ensuring its electronic functionality while implanted behind the eye. Lazzi said Argus II activates similarly to a scoreboard where hundreds of LED lights behind the eye turn on and off to display a partial image the blind patient sees by targeting certain points in the retina. 
From his previous work in the bioelectromagnetic field, Humayun was able to develop the idea to use electrical stimulation to restore vision to people who are blind while Lazzi designed electrodes that would be placed on the retina to ensure the electronics used work properly in the eye.
The engineering work for the project has proved challenging because contacts were composed of electronic systems that pose a safety risk and may be damaged when submerged in the salty vitreous humor of the eye, Lazzi said. The issues have since been resolved by having electric currents and wireless transmissions strictly regulated in a casing.
Humayun also reached out to colleague Salhia in 2018 to ask her to collaborate on the project based on her translational genomics lab’s research with rat retinas that have degenerative diseases. Through this work, the team was able to show that electrical stimulation to the retina caused changes to genes associated with neuroprotection that maintains the structural integrity of neurons, which aids in preventing cell death. 
“The beauty of the project lies in how three groups from very different backgrounds basically come together to solve a problem,” Salhia said. “It’s been one the funnest and most exciting and most innovative projects that I’ve recently engaged in because it’s just so highly interdisciplinary and people from very different backgrounds are coming together to solve a problem.” 
Although the team of three has just begun its research for a new vision device with the funds provided from the grant, its members have already seen encouraging results in Salhia’s research on rat retinas and are looking forward to continuing their work to help patients in the coming years.
“We have this grant for three years, so we hope to be in a pretty good position,” Humayun said. “In three years, we hope to be pretty far along in all these aspects as to whether we would be ready to do human studies.”

Our news feeds have become a monolith.
Go ahead and take a look. Whether it’s the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal (I am purposely excluding fanatical fringe elements of the media such as Breitbart), the news has largely become one indistinguishable amalgamation of the same story.
Every hour, the number of coronavirus cases and deaths increases. Every day, a new regulation to combat the virus is issued and another news outlet reports on a new scientific model that predicts that X number of Americans will die and X% will soon be infected. 
This pattern of reporting is despairingly repetitious but also absolutely essential. The availability of widespread and reliable information is more necessary now than it has ever been, and the American public must understand the stakes that underpin our grim circumstances. 
In the midst of all of this, it becomes easy to feel bogged down in the never-ending flood of discouraging news. So, in the interest of our collective mental health, I would like to offer a respite from the daily news cycle. Here are three virus-free sports stories you might’ve missed since American public life was upended.
NFL players vote yes on league’s new collective bargaining agreement 
On March 15, the NFL Player’s Association voted yes by a margin of 1,019 to 959 to approve a successor to the league’s current collective bargaining agreement. The new agreement could take effect as soon as next season and will remain in place until 2030. 
As expected, the terms of the new CBA are controversial. Owners will benefit from an added regular season game and an expanded playoff format that includes two additional teams. These provisions should entice media companies to sign more lucrative broadcasting contracts with the league, which would significantly benefit the coffers of the league’s owners and executives. 
Some players, on the other hand, are a lot less satisfied. Many, such as All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman, have opposed extending the regular season out of concern that the additional game will lead to a rise in injuries.
On Monday, former pro-bowl safety Eric Reid released a statement through his lawyers alleging that changes were made to the CBA after the NFLPA’s approval. According to the statement, Reid argues that the changes made to the new CBA reduces payouts to the league’s disabled former players. 
So, regardless of where you stand on the agreement’s merits, it’s clear that the controversy surrounding the deal will not end anytime soon.
NFL free agency changes the league’s landscape
Only days after the new CBA was approved, what is perhaps the most exciting period of the league’s offseason — free agency — kicked off, and it was no disappointment.  
Household names such as wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and running back Todd Gurley found new homes with the Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons, respectively. Stars such as Calias Campbell and Stefon Diggs also joined new teams, with Campbell traded to the Baltimore Ravens and Diggs traded to the Buffalo Bills. 
Did I forget to mention that DeForest Buckner, Dante Fowler Jr., Robert Quinn and Nelson Agholor all signed with new teams as well? If all of this player movement is too much for you, avert your eyes from the screen now because I haven’t even gotten to the 2020 quarterback carousel.
Former Heisman winner Marcus Mariota is now a Las Vegas Raider. The Super Bowl legend that is Nick Foles has signed with the hapless Chicago Bears. Former NFL MVP Cam Newton is unemployed. 
Also, Tom Brady now plays for a team whose mascot goes by the name of Captain Fear. 
If that doesn’t brighten your day, I don’t know what will. 
Clippers’ owner Steve Ballmer buys The Forum 
I know you’re probably very preoccupied with the activities of a certain billionaire that is running the country, but if you’re a resident of Los Angeles or you’d just like a brief reprieve from our Schmuck-in-Chief, I’d recommend you focus your attention on another billionaire: Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft CEO and currently the wealthiest owner in the NBA. 
Ballmer’s Clippers bought The Forum in Inglewood for $400 million last week, effectively removing the last remaining obstacle in the way of constructing a new billion-dollar basketball arena for Ballmer’s team. 
For Clippers fans, it must feel great to finally have a place to call their own after two decades of playing second-fiddle at Staples Center.
Still, it remains to be seen if the new arena will have any impact on the Clippers’ miserable history of shortcomings and mediocrity. Until then, Lakers fans such as myself will take comfort in 16 NBA championships and 26 Hall of Famers. 
Stay healthy everyone.

Richard Reeves, journalist and faculty member at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, died Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles from cardiac arrest, according to an In memoriam piece from Annenberg. He was 83.
“Richard was one of his generation’s most accomplished political journalists,” Annenberg Journalism School director Gordon Stables wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “He was a witness to history … He also loved to share through his teaching. He enjoyed every opportunity to help his students grow as writers and, more importantly, as people. Even as he struggled with his health, he constantly spoke about working with his students.”
Reeves, who worked at Annenberg for 22 years, started at USC as a visiting professor in 1998, according to the Annenberg article. He became a full-time lecturer in 2006 and taught classes such as “Writing Magazine Non-Fiction” and “Feature Writing.” Reeves is remembered by his students for his ability to connect on a personal level with all of those who took his classes. 
“He was always super encouraging and treated me just the same as the people who were older and had more experience,” said Lauren Giella, a senior majoring in journalism who took Reeves’ magazine writing class last year. “He took that time to make sure that every piece that I turned in, every draft after every edit was better than the one before.”
Reeves, who spent decades as a journalist and author, wrote several books following U.S. politics, history and the responsibility of the press, his most recent of which was “Infamy: The Shocking Story of the Japanese-American Internment in World War II” published in 2015. Among his best sellers was “President Kennedy: Profile of Power” published in 1993 about John F. Kennedy’s 1,000 days in office. Reeves’ opinion columns on U.S. politics appeared in more than 100 newspapers between 1979 and 2014, including the Los Angeles Times and Baltimore Sun.
“He was a terrific colleague,” said associate professor of journalism Jonathan Kotler, who met Reeves at Annenberg. “I would always make it a point to sit with him in faculty meetings. He was both wise and funny at the same time. He was basically good company.”
Reeves, born in New York City on Nov. 28, 1936, graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey with a mechanical engineering degree. Realizing his interest lied elsewhere, he entered the journalism field in the 1960s as a print reporter. By 1966, he was the chief political correspondent at The New York Times, and he later served as an editor and columnist at New York Magazine and Esquire.
“He had such an amazing career and life before he came to teaching,” said Emma Peplow, who took two classes with Reeves before graduating in 2018. “And I think it was really easy to forget about that when you were in his class because he really made an effort to get to know every student, and you felt like he was your friend and your peer. And so then, in class, all of a sudden, he would tell this crazy [story] about covering Woodstock or interviewing the president. It would shock you back into this reality that you were being taught by this incredible figure.” 
Among his students, Reeves was not known as someone who sent or responded to many emails, but Peplow remembers one he sent her at the end of her magazine writing class. At the start of the semester, Reeves asked students to write about what they wanted to learn during the course. Peplow wrote that she wanted to develop her first-person writing because she wasn’t confident in her abilities.
“Emma — I loved your piece. If you can’t write in the first person,no one can…Richard” he wrote to her after she turned in her final assignment.
And that stuck with her.
“It’s something small, but it really shows he really tried to take interest in the things his students were interested in,” Peplow said. “You would have meetings with him normally that were supposed to go for 30 minutes, and they would last hours and hours. And he would just ask you everything you were interested in because he genuinely wanted to understand what drove you and what you loved.”
Julia Poe, a soccer beat writer at the Orlando Sentinel who graduated in 2019, said she cherished the times Reeves would delay the start of class to catch up on sports with her.
“Every other person would be staring at me with their eyes glazed over because they did not give a crap, but it was just me and [Reeves] talking about his old days covering the Yankees and my days covering Sam Darnold and the boys,” Poe said. “Beyond him as a professor, he was just the best person to talk to, just the most fun person to talk to.”
The feeling was no different among his fellow faculty members, Kotler said.
“He was thorough, he was a really good writer, he was great at interviews, he developed a really good network of inside sources. I mean, he was everything we try and teach our students to become, and he was a good friend,” Kotler said. “He’s gonna be missed because he was one of the good guys. He was authentic, nothing phony about him.”
Reeves is survived by his son Jeffrey Reeves, his daughters Cynthia Fyfe and Fiona Reeves and his stepsons Conor and Colin O’Neill.
“A lot of professors don’t really have that gift of listening and encouraging and supporting young writers and he knew how to boost a young writer’s confidence in just such a special, unique way,” Poe said. “Part of that came from just the decades of experience that he had in the industry. So when he looked at you and told you that an idea was good or that it was valid, you actually felt that and he just always went out of his way.”
