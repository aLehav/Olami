Almost two months ago, after the Daily Trojan wrapped up production for the spring semester, I thought I had written the final installment of “The State of Play.” Weeks later, when I agreed to give the column another go for the summer, I was excited but also deeply worried — American life had still not resumed since the coronavirus outbreak, and not a single significant sporting event was scheduled for months. 
As a result, I was convinced that within weeks, I would find myself staring at a blank Google doc for the 10th straight hour, eyes bloodshot, desperately clawing at any sporting development that remotely resembled a workable topic for the column. 
I was very, very wrong. 
Not a single meaningful sporting event has taken place in the United States since March (sorry UFC fans, but I’m going to have to exclude you here). Pitches haven’t been thrown, shots haven’t been blocked and games haven’t been played in more than four months, and yet, the past couple of weeks have been host to the most significant sports developments I’ve ever witnessed. 
Since my last column alone, tweets from college football players have forced an apology from a Power-Five coach who exaggerated his outreach to his team, gotten one assistant suspended, opened an investigation into the highest-paid strength and conditioning coach in the country and caused programwide reckonings throughout the NCAA. In the same vein, athletes at USC have organized to combat racial inequity and football players at UCLA have united to demand third-party health assistance in light of what they describe as UCLA’s perpetual failures and negligence. 
These events represent only a fraction of what has taken place in recent weeks. In addition to the upheaval within the college ranks, change and resistance have consumed professional sports. Less than two weeks ago, NASCAR banned the display of the Confederate flag at races — and the FBI is now investigating a noose found in Black driver Bubba Wallace’s garage at Talladega Superspeedway. On June 12, Kyrie Irving and other notable players injected doubt into the prospects of the NBA season restarting by voicing their fears that a season resumption might distract from ongoing civil rights efforts. To top it off, it looks like baseball as we know it might be over because greedy owners and greedy players refuse to prioritize the fate of the game over their checkbooks. 
To put it plainly, an absolute shit-ton of stuff is happening and happening fast. It feels nearly impossible to keep up with daily sports developments. Given the sheer volume of it all, deriving a single succinct, packaged message is nearly impossible.
So, a lot is going on, but what the fuck does it all mean? 
Well, it means a lot. You don’t need a fancy, criminally overpriced USC degree to know that. But, if this is going to be the very last installment of “The State of Play,” I’d like to drive one point home as hard as I can: The barrier between politics and ordinary American life is completely shattered. It’s gone, and there is no place where this is more evident than sports. 
For almost half a year, I’ve ranted on this column about how sports, politics and American society intersect. Now, I think that much is painfully and obviously clear. 
Today, however, what I’m trying to communicate is not only that they intersect, but also that the intersection is illustrative of the unavoidable nature of politics in modern American life. 
For most of my memorable sports fandom, there’s been a tension between the worlds of sports and politics. Broadly speaking, a large and often loud faction of sports fans has repeatedly expressed reluctance to discuss the two topics in the same breath. To do so, in their mind, would be to contaminate one of the great escapes available to Americans. In other words, sometimes work sucks, family sucks, presidents suck and life sucks, but sports is always fucking awesome — an unadulterated world of pure action and entertainment, devoid of life’s politics and other annoyances. 
Look, I understand that position. In fact, I sympathize with some elements of it. But in the world we live in today, no aspect of American life — especially sports — can be removed from our present-day politics. 
Today, if you want to talk about sports or even have a remotely thoughtful opinion about the state of sports, you’re going to have to know a thing or two about political and social issues. If you want to talk about the prospects of sports returning, you’re going to have to talk about the prospects of our dumbass-in-chief getting his shit together. If you want to talk about college football, you’re going to have to talk about the fact that last season’s College Football Playoff champion and runner-up currently share at least 53 cases of coronavirus infection between the two rosters. To ignore these realities would be like talking about ’90s baseball without bringing up steroids or talking about my column without mentioning the appalling amount of literary incompetence that it contains on a biweekly basis. 
The option of being apolitical no longer exists. The Karens and Joe Sixpacks of the world can no longer absolve themselves of moral responsibility simply by saying “I don’t want to talk about politics.”
What’s more is that these shouldn’t even be political issues. Athletes shouldn’t have to watch the confederate flag — a symbol of racism, oppression and treason — be paraded around sporting events like it’s a goddamn pony. Black college athletes shouldn’t be forced to put their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the line for free while their predominantly white coaches and college administrators rake in seven-figure salaries for sitting on their asses. 
These issues are not about politics. They are about human rights, respect and dignity. For sports fans, that reality — and their participation in it — is now inescapable.

The USC Athletic Department announced its format for student-athletes to begin returning to campus for voluntary workouts Tuesday. The plan comprises three phases, the first of which kicks off Wednesday with returning local athletes permitted to start a mandatory pre-participation process that includes coronavirus testing.   Phase two of the plan will allow returning non-local student-athletes — defined as those outside of a one-hour commute to campus — to begin the pre-participation process. The target date for the commencement of phase two is July 6.The third phase, targeted to begin July 13, allows new and incoming student-athletes to begin the pre-participation process. Ensuing phases will not begin until the previous phase has been successfully completed.
The pre-participation process for all student-athletes returning to campus will also include a coronavirus health and safety protocol information session, USC’s TrojanLearn training module, the signature of a risk and shared responsibility acknowledgement form and their typical physical. Student-athletes must be cleared by USC’s athletic medicine staff after completing the pre-participation checklist, and they will be tested for the virus on a weekly basis after the first.The initial phased plan is limited only to football, women’s soccer, women’s volleyball, men’s water polo, men’s basketball and women’s basketball student-athletes. Target dates and specific protocol for the return of student-athletes from other sports have not yet been determined.“We approached this process with extreme patience, prudence, and the utmost regard for the health and safety of our student-athletes, taking time to learn from the experiences of our peers to refine our plans and processes,” Athletic Director Mike Bohn said in the press release announcing the plan. “After a devastating few months, we are thrilled for them that they will be able to come to back to campus to do what they love and continue their preparation for their upcoming seasons.”On-campus housing facilities will be available to student-athletes during the latter two of the initial three return phrases.The voluntary nature of the workouts means that student-athletes will not be required to participate in the return plan and will not face financial aid consequences for opting out. Bohn said the department is fully supportive of student-athletes’ decisions whether they choose to partake in the voluntary workouts or not.Access to athletic facilities during voluntary workouts will be limited to essential personnel such as strength coaches, trainers, equipment managers and facilities and operations staff — all of whom will undergo coronavirus testing.Social distancing and hygiene guidelines at athletic facilities will be strict: Student-athletes and staff must complete a daily questionnaire regarding coronavirus symptoms before leaving for athletic facilities, and upon entrance, they will be required to have their temperature taken, wear face coverings, social distance, sanitize hands frequently and wear a wristband to signify they have been approved to enter the facility.Student-athletes will be required to park vehicles and store personal belongings in individually assigned areas at facilities, have laundry washed regularly and receive personal water bottles, towels and meals for use each day. Capacity at the McKay Center weight room will be limited to eight student-athletes, and equipment will be sanitized following each group’s workout. Student-athletes must make an appointment if they wish to access the athletic training room and meetings with coaches outside workouts will be held virtually through June.USC Student Health and the Athletic Department will partner to conduct the coronavirus testing. Anyone who tests positive must isolate according to Los Angeles County Department of Public Health guidelines, with Student Health providing quarantine housing. Individuals must be cleared before returning to athletic facilities, and USC’s contact tracing will require anyone who has come into contact with affected individuals on campus to quarantine.“The reality is that we expect to have positive tests and outbreaks in our university community, including in Athletics,” Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in the press release. “We have been very thorough in planning for such occurrences and to prevent the spread of the virus.”The Athletic Department will establish guidelines for off-campus student-athlete activities during the restart plan, and administrators and coaches will work to enforce such guidelines. Student-athletes must always comply with social distancing protocols, wear face coverings when in public or with another individual, refrain from collecting in groups and immediately report symptoms, among other expectations.“Those returning have a responsibility to protect our community at all times, not only when they are working out,” Bohn said. “We expect them to adhere to all standards and restrictions in our restart plan so that their fellow student-athletes and our entire community remains safe and healthy.”In early June, the Athletic Department conducted a survey to allow student-athletes to voice their opinion on returning to campus for voluntary workouts. USC held individual meetings with unnamed student-athletes, several of which President Carol Folt attended. Head football coach Clay Helton also hosted an information session for his players and a forum for them to raise questions and concerns about returning to campus, along with a webinar for the parents of USC football players.Along with Director of Sports Medicine Dr. John Brodhead, Van Orman and the University developed the plan in adherence to the LACDPH’s guidelines as well as NCAA and Pac-12 recommendations and protocol before it was approved by USC administration members.The NCAA is allowing mandatory organized activities to begin July 13 for football and July 20 for men’s and women’s basketball. Dates for other sports have not yet been announced.The return plan is tentative and subject to change based on the tenuous nature of the coronavirus pandemic.
