A successful theatre production is nothing without its characters.
Balm in Gilead, directed by Stephanie Shroyer, just finished its weekend run at McClintock Theatre. Written by esteemed playwright Lanford Wilson, it takes place in all-night coffee shop and the street corner outside in Manhattan, 1966, which is frequented by rough men and women, prostitutes, pimps, junkies and dealers.
There isn’t much of a plot, but the story loosely focuses on Darlene, a naïve, wide-eyed and talkative prostitute from Chicago, double casted by Gabrielle Walsh and Betsy Newman, and Joe (Kevin Graber) a drug dealer who believes he is on the brink of a big break. The two of them are drawn together and manage to find a balm for their desperation and loneliness in a relationship with each other.
Balm in Gilead was truly a living and breathing piece. Long before the play officially started, the cast members were already on the set and embodying their characters.
Most of time, the stage was incredibly loud. There was a din of overlapping dialogue, arguments, brawls and occasional singing that seemed chaotic at times, but succeeded in engaging the audience. The play never got boring; there was always something interesting to watch. Also, partway through the show, the cast rotated the café, giving the audience a whole new angle on the same set, a simple, yet refreshing change.
Because the plot didn’t have a conventional structure, it didn’t have the typical tension, rising action, climax and resolution that the audience would expect. Audience members weren’t sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for twists and turns. It became clear that the same thing happens day in and day out at the café. The arguments, bums wandering in only to be thrown out, prostitutes and junkies all sum up to business as usual.
The plot, which gets lost under the rich chaos of the characters, is pretty predictable and uninteresting. It serves to give the play a vague sense of direction and purpose, to ground its slice-of-life episodic nature, but Balm in Gilead isn’t really about plot. Watching the crazy junkie talk to himself, prostitutes apply makeup and trying to pick up customers, the lesbian couple cuddling and talking affectionately in the booth, bums shivering outside and people brawling, arguing and sharing brief, intimate moments is the true story of Balm in Gilead.
The focus is on the characters, which is why the ensemble cast of 29 works so well. However, the two so-called leads fall a little short. Neither Darlene nor Joe are particularly captivating, and even though the story focuses a little more on them than the rest of the ensemble, they get a little lost in the myriad.
Balm in Gilead is an intriguing piece. Each character feels tremendously real, with his/her own quirks, thoughts, needs, desires and fears. But because there are so many characters, there isn’t much depth to them aside from Darlene, and none of them are fully fleshed out or explored. The audience gets whatever the characters say and do in their own little subplots, which is enough to make them real, but not enough to let the audience truly know them.
Balm in Gilead is a fascinating piece that tells a loud, collective tale of the loneliness and desperation of the vagrants who frequent the café, punctuated by only a couple of quiet moments. While the plot is unconventional and there seem to be too many characters involved, those characters feel incredibly real and keep the audience interested until the pessimistic, yet realistic ending.

When I first heard the news about potential recruiting violations at Oregon, I immediately thought of the movie Blue Chips, which I had just caught a few days earlier on HBO.
For the uninitiated, Blue Chips is a story about blatant violations in college recruiting.
Basketball coach Pete Bell (played by a basketball-kicking, Bob-Knight-impersonating Nick Nolte) had built a winning program by following the rules, but sees his success falter when he can’t seem to land top recruits anymore.
Big-time players are heading to the schools that are providing them with cars and cash in exchange for their letter of intent. Bell eventually abandons his morals and gets into the dirty recruiting game in the name of winning.
When I heard Oregon had paid scout Will Lyles $25,000 for recruiting services, I wasn’t even surprised.
Whether within the rules or not, the Oregon situation is a stark reminder that the mechanism of college recruiting is corrupt at multiple levels.
Like in Blue Chips, current big-time college sports are infested with a culture of cheating.
It’s seen as the only way to the top.
This past season saw the Cam Newton saga, the North Carolina suspensions, the Terrelle Pryor incident and now the possible shady actions in Eugene, Ore. (Note: Oregon still has a chance to prove its innocence, but the Ducks are sure smelling like another water-dwelling creature right now.)
Top-performing programs seemingly have to break the rules to retain their status.
Many basketball and football programs that have won a national championship in the last decade have either committed violations at some point (USC is the gold standard here) or have prompted whispers about violations.
Because it’s assumed that everybody is doing it, it’s no longer a shock when we hear about the next incident or the next school being investigated by the NCAA.
The worst thing is that this culture of cheating has become so accepted in the last 20 years.
Sure, the NCAA will drop the sanctions hammer every so often, but it must lack either the capacity or the will to legitimately regulate college recruiting. (I’m betting the latter.)
I’m not saying every coach is dirty or kids don’t have legitimate reasons for taking benefits, especially when schools are getting filthy rich off their athletic skills and images.
I’m not offering a solution to the problem because I don’t have one.
But the root of the problem is in the culture, where cheating has been allowed to seep into and adulterate what was once a pure game.
Texas coach Mack Brown offered interesting insight into this topic during a press conference in 2008.
“You’re always going to have violations by schools … because some coaches are going to cheat,” Brown said. “That’s the way they’ve made their living. You’re always going to have some families that buy into that and you’re always going to have a certain level of families that look you right in the face and lie to you.”
Brown said he asked Penn State coach Joe Paterno what to do with recruits that were seeking extra incentive. JoePa’s solution?
“Stay away from them.”
As we’ve seen over and over again, easier said than done.
I used to be a sports purist.
As a young kid, I always preferred college sports because there were no contract disputes and it wasn’t constantly referred to as a “business.”
Young men and women were playing for their schools, for pride and that’s all — or so I thought. Turns out at the highest levels, college athletics is as much a business as the pro game is, and a dirtier one at that.
The best line in Blue Chips is delivered when Bell finds out one of his favorite players, Tony, shaved points in a game the previous season.
Bell comes face-to-face with Tony and hollers, “You took the only pure thing in your life, and you corrupted it, for what? For what?”
Since Bell had also cheated by this point in the movie, he is asking himself the question as much as he is asking Tony. For what?
For the money. For the Ws. For the glory.
Not for the game.

After USC’s astonishing 62-46 win over Arizona State on Feb. 26, USC coach Kevin O’Neill closed his post-game press conference with a short message for the rest of the Pac-10: “If Marcus Simmons isn’t the defense player of the year for the conference, I don’t know who is.”
Shutdown defender · USC coach Kevin O’Neill has typically placed senior forward Marcus Simmons on the opposing team’s primary scoring threat no matter his size. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
O’Neill’s statement was heard loud and clear as Simmons was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year by the conference’s coaches Monday.
Junior forward Nikola Vucevic was also named to the All-Pac-10 first team.
“I am really fired up for those guys,” O’Neill said. “They both deserve it. Without those two guys, we would not be anywhere, so I am glad that they both got rewarded.”
From shutting down Kansas’ Tyshawn Taylor, Washington’s Isaiah Thomas to Washington State’s Klay Thompson and everyone in between this year, Simmons has been the glue for a Trojans team leading the conference in scoring defense, allowing only 62.9 points per game.
Although his statistics (0.3 blocks and 0.7 steals per game) don’t jump off the page, Simmons’ flexibility at defensive end has allowed O’Neill to stick the senior on the opposing team’s top player regardless of his size advantage.
Simmons is the first USC player to win the award since forward Taj Gibson claimed the honor following his junior season in 2009.

The losses have begun to pile up, but nonetheless, USC has been competitive with some of the best teams in the country.
Each of the Trojans’ eight losses have come against perennially strong college baseball programs, including weekend sweeps by No. 6 Cal State Fullerton and No. 18 Rice.
Time for change · Junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa, pictured here during Sunday’s home 2-1 loss to Cal State Fullerton, will move from his traditional position to the outfield for Tuesday’s contest at UC Santa Barbara. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Only one loss was by more than four runs and USC (3-8) has lost four games by a single run.
But barely losing to nationally ranked teams isn’t good enough for the Trojans and interim coach Frank Cruz.
“When you play or coach at USC, you plan on playing the best competition,” Cruz said. “But you don’t come to USC just to compete, you come to win.”
Against Fullerton, the Trojans struggled offensively, managing only eight hits in the series.
When the team heads to UC Santa Barbara (5-4) to take on the Gauchos at 2 p.m. today, Cruz plans to inject more offense into the lineup.
Preseason All-American first baseman Ricky Oropesa will move to the outfield, where the Trojans have been offensively challenged, outside of Alex Sherrod (.275, 2 HR, 7 RBI), through the first 11 games.
Outfielders sophomore Alex Glenn, senior Matt Hart and freshman Omar Cotto Lozada, who have combined for 21 starts, are each hitting below .200 creating a void in the lineup.
“It’s wide open right now,” Cruz said about the left field and centerfield positions. “We’re hoping someone steps in and can take over.”
With Oropesa in the outfield, junior Matt Foat will play first base with sophomore Adam Landecker manning the hot corner at third base.
Another change from USC’s first two weekday games will be on the mound.
Cruz said he is leaning toward starting Brandon Garcia (0-1, 12.00 ERA in three innings pitched) over junior Ben Mount (0-0, 1.08 ERA in eight and one-third innings pitched), who has started both of the Trojans’ Tuesday games this season.
Garcia, who has the third highest batting average (.280) among regular starters, will also serve as the team’s designated hitter, allowing him to stay in the lineup even after a relief pitcher takes his place on the mound.
Garcia, Mount and the rest of the pitching staff will be tasked with shutting down a UC Santa Barbara offense batting .295 and averaging six runs per game.
Leading the Gauchos is the outfield duo of seniors Ben Edelstein and Mark Haddow.
Edelstein bats leadoff and led the team with a .344 batting average last season. This season, he is batting .343 as he sets the table for the middle of the lineup, including Haddow batting cleanup. Haddow has a team best .375 average and .462 on base percentage. He also is second on the team in home runs and RBIs.
UC Santa Barbara will likely send right-hander Nick Loredo to the mound. Loredo leads the Gauchos’ starting pitchers with a 3.09 ERA. He has a 1-0 record and has struck out 14 batters in 11 and two-thirds innings pitched.
The Trojans’ hitters will have to make adjustments each time through the lineup as the Gauchos are expected to throw a number of relief pitchers today.
“I know the players have turned a lot around in terms of their work ethic and whole approach to the game,” Cruz said. “Now it’s about winning games.”
Cruz doesn’t want his team to just compete. He wants them to have fun.
“Any time you’re not winning games, it’s not fun,” Cruz said. “Winning is a lot of fun.”

If you gathered all the irritants in your life and tossed them into a pile, what would you get?
Most would probably just see an accumulated mess of the hardships that have plagued them for months or even years on end. But more than 800 survivors of domestic violence have uncovered beauty, wisdom and strength from their own piles in the wake of abuse.
“People talk about [domestic violence survivors] but don’t want to hear what they have to say. Turning those things around, it empowers them,” said local artist Kim Abeles. “If they can ground their feelings in either an image or metaphor, then they have a chance to survive.”
With support and resources from the non-profit women’s organization, A Window Between Worlds, Abeles has given women, children and men an opportunity to unchain themselves from secrecy and shame and start a dialogue with community members through the art exhibit, “Pearls of Wisdom.”
Running now through March 31 at the Korean Cultural Center in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, “Pearls of Wisdom” showcases nearly 1,000 handcrafted pearls made in more than 70 womens’ shelters across California.
The exhibit coincides with Women’s History Month and the 20th anniversary of the founding of A Window Between Worlds, which began in Venice, Calif. and currently aids more than 50,000 domestic violence survivors in more than 20 states. The organization, which is composed of trained volunteers and local artists, uses art as a form of healing.
According to Outreach Chair Barbara Ketchum, “Pearls of Wisdom” is two years in the making.
The exhibit features two types of pearls: Flat, disc-like ones that come from out-of-town shelters, and 3-D representations created in L.A. workshops facilitated by Abeles.
“The women started by writing their experiences on mylar, which was sort of reflective because it looks back at you,” Ketchum said. “Then they crunched the mylar around the irritant — actual tokens, such as wedding rings, bottles and even bullets — and wrapped it in yarn or fabric.”
The irritants were then wrapped in bandages, a material used because of its symbolic power.
“One of the women I talked to said, ‘It was like healing my wounds,’” Ketchum said.
Now hidden from sight with another layer, the irritants were covered with plaster, molded and finished with a coat of paint.
What emerged is a striking menagerie, creations of various shapes, sizes and textures painted with swirls of pastels or sweeping strokes of matte colors. Some are even adorned with charms, flowers or braided string.
Abeles has firsthand experience with abuse. A victim of domestic violence and sexual assaults, she said she started “feeling like a rag doll” as her life wore on.
It only grew worse with her refusal to sort through her own pile of hardships, even as she developed several works of art that commented on her  suffering and oppression, including an exhibit she describes as “Charlie Manson and love lockets.”
“I put this stuff on the back burner. I never thought about that work again, never lectured on it. I did it, put it away. Therefore, I never really learned from it,” Abeles said. “When the Window project came up, all that stuff crept up. If you just keep putting it off, it comes back with a vengeance.”
“Pearls of Wisdom” triggered some unwanted nerves in Abeles, a social-activist artist whose portfolio consists largely of work centered on the environment.
Yet, she found herself connected to the women. As a fellow survivor, Abeles was able to avoid “doing the pity thing” as she showed she was riding the same wave of emotions.
“I like working with community because it’s really challenging to not seem like you have all the answers,” Abeles said. “I would frame [the workshops] as, anytime you make art, there is a comfort and a soothingness. It’s about feeling centered.”
For the survivors, who participated, being “centered” comes with  the pearl, their tragedies lying dormant inside.
“There needs to be a place to put that damn story. There’s a tendency to want to repeat that horrible story over and over again until you don’t even need the abuser anymore,” Abeles said. “You just sucked it up and all you see yourself as is that story.”
These stories are not only in the pearl but also in the quotes Abeles collected from the survivors. Imprinted on the gallery walls and in the exhibit’s accompanying The Handbook for Living, the most affecting quote speaks to the motivation behind “Pearls of Wisdom:” “Women should help each other and be welcoming to those who need our help.”
Great article! It’s nice to know that there are resources available for victims of domestic abuse. These programs were not available in my mother’s generation. Many women suffered abuse (mental & physical) with no where to turn. Domestic abuse also affects children as much as adults. The effects can last a lifetime.
Thank you for this article. What they are doing is beautiful. I hope to go check out the exhibit myself sometime soon.

Ben Haggerty, better known as Macklemore, is leading the drive to put the Seattle hip-hop scene on the map.
Tucked away in the northwest corner of the country, Seattle is known more for its annual level of rainfall than for its burgeoning hip-hop scene.
Moving on up · Seattle rapper Macklemore (left) says the inspiration for his tracks comes simply from taking in all of his surroundings. - Photo courtesy of Zach Quillen 
But Macklemore’s upcoming tour strives to bring him to the attention of hip-hop fans nationwide and change the stereotypical image of rainy Seattle.
“I was born and raised in Seattle, I’ve spent the majority of my life here and I’m extremely proud of where I come from,” Macklemore said. “There’s a unique authenticity to our city and it’s one that, on a national level in terms of hip-hop music, has never been fully exposed. The reason why I am the way that I am and [write] the music that I write is because of Seattle.”
After overcoming issues with substance abuse that began in 2006, Macklemore appeared again on hip-hop’s radar in 2009 when he released a mixtape in collaboration with DJ Ryan Lewis.
The mixtape featured samples from several famous groups, including the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Killers.
But Macklemore doesn’t just take samples from mainstream artists. At only 14 years old, he started the hip-hop group Elevated Elements before shifting to a solo career. And now, at only 28 years old, his booked shows prove that he is moving up in the ranks of the music world.
From his beginnings in the music industry, Macklemore has clearly strived to create tracks that echo home and everything he has experienced.
“Inspiration comes from anything,” Macklemore said. “Inspiration is everywhere, it’s just that we are not in tune with our surroundings enough … when we can quiet the mind and calm it down and tap into what’s right in front of us, there’s always a song there.”
He has a habit of creating music that raises the hair on your arms. His uplifting lyrics about life’s struggles paired with head- bumping beats inspire and heal.
What makes his music so genuine is that Macklemore speaks from experience.
“Whatever happens, I have to be okay with it … the challenge is learning to accept it and yet striving to make things happen the way you can envision them,” Macklemore said.
Macklemore is a rare breed of lyricist in today’s mostly self-righteous music industry, and it is his honesty in songwriting that makes him stand out.
His ability to observe and process everything that comes his way humbles him, something the listener can feel in his music.
Macklemore’s songs are less about creating catchy tunes and more about sincerely looking at life’s complexities.
“We go through life trying to hold onto things and we have these expectations,” Macklemore said. “We’re trying to navigate life thinking we’re in control … but there’s always going to be things that are completely out of our control and the minute you can learn to accept those things life becomes more fulfilling.”
Macklemore is currently on tour across the country and will stop in Los Angeles tonight to play a show at the Viper Room.
“I hope that we can get out on the road and we can connect with fans that have been supporting the music, or maybe they just found out about us or maybe they’ve never heard of us,” Macklemore said.
Macklemore’s music is equal parts spontaneity and calculated precision. His use of cadence, emphasis, lyrical content and undeniable love for what he does combine to produce the perfect blend of hip-hop.
If he can create this effect through a pair of headphones, it will be exciting to see what he can do on stage.
“I don’t think there’s a formula,” Macklemore said. “I just know what works for me and what works for me is listening to a beat that inspires me or having an experience that fuels the writing.”
We’re having a hoedown, are you hoes down?
sir raven bowie <3 hahahaa
Macklemore is incredible, I can’t wait to see his show at the Viper Room!!!

A new drug is sweeping the nation. The name of that drug: Charlie Sheen.
We’ve been told, straight from the warlock’s mouth, that the drug is “not available because if you try it once, you will die. Your face will melt off and your children will weep over your exploded body.”
Yet, the American public has not been deterred.
In the past week, the now former Two and a Half Men star has given “exclusive” interviews on countless networks, started a Twitter account and posted an online talk show, all while offering a seemingly infinite number of sound bites of rambling incoherence.
Unfortunately, the Sheen drug, however appealing and addictive, risks removing more important issues from the public eye.
The Sheen madness began after he claimed to have completed his time in rehabilitation last month.
The actor then gave a public rant blaming Two and a Half Men creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre for delaying the return of the show from hiatus. Sheen was officially fired Monday.
On Feb. 24, Lorre officially shut down production of the top-rated show for the rest of the season.
Sheen began his now-ubiquitous media coup last Monday with interviews on shows such as ABC’s Good Morning America.
The true wonder might be how his interviewers manage to keep a straight face as he describes, in all seriousness, his “fire-breathing fists,” “tiger blood” and commitment to “winning.”
But the actor bypassed the reporters altogether  when he aired “Sheen’s Korner,” a 50-minute show Sheen described as a “disorganized random experiment of sorts,” on Ustream.
“Sheen’s Korner” attracted more than 100,000 viewers in one night, and Sheen’s appearance earned Piers Morgan double the number of viewers his show, Piers Morgan Tonight, usually gets. According to the numbers, if not his psychiatrist, Sheen does, in fact, seem to be winning.
Last Thursday, Sheen set a Guinness World Record for the fastest time to reach one million followers on Twitter. Sheen might be the one instigating a lot of the media hype, but no one has hesitated to latch on.
Sheen-related memes, including pictures of cute animals with quotes from Sheen as captions, are circulating on Facebook, and ‘fans’ continue to post spoof videos on YouTube.
And how could interviews in which Sheen declares he is “a total freakin’ rock star from Mars” not become fodder for satire?
He has turned himself into an unrecognizable caricature, a move that allows people to look past the tragedy of the disintegration of a man’s life and career and only see comedy.
Sheen’s absurdly overblown narcissism makes it hard to feel sympathy for him, but there is still something unsettling about the public’s fascination with an odd brand of loyalty to the actor.
And networks seem to have no qualms about capitalizing on the schadenfreude we feel watching a celebrity fall from grace, no matter how little news value his story might hold.
Today Show executive producer Jim Bell told the Associated Press, “It’s a great story. We don’t have this much interest when we have a big interview on Libya or a powerful, smart series on the brain.”
Interestingly, a number of online news sources and memes have recently taken to comparing Sheen and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who is also known for his flamboyant self-aggrandizement and radically out-there statements.
But the tragedy overlooked by the popular focus on Gaddafi’s easy-to-ridicule delusions of grandeur is an unfathomably more serious one than the problems of America’s highest-paid TV actor, and the comparison between the two men, albeit a satirical one, reveals the superficiality of so much media coverage.
Sheen has allowed us some good laughs and plenty of confusion in the last two weeks, but the media continues to dissuade us from looking too deeply or thinking too hard about what any of it means.
Such a tendency might be a little disheartening when it comes to celebrity scandal, but it becomes a slippery slope when it allows us to ignore the violent crimes against humanity being committed by an oppressive dictator in favor of comedic sound bites from a ridiculous character.

For many artists, making art is about more than just creating visually appealing pieces.
Currently on display at USC’s Fisher Museum of Art is the work of contemporary realist Sylvia Shap, who works through oil painting and mixed media to colorfully capture her subjects.

Her intriguing spirit of inquiry allows her work to revitalize the long-standing technique of portraiture in the art world.
Shap’s work is largely concerned with the psychological state of her subjects and aims to explore different ways of living.
Shap attempts to capture both the realistic personalities of the subjects in their physical look as well as  what makes them tick.
“When I’m working with my subjects I get to have a very intimate relationship with them and I get to learn what their concerns are in life, or things that don’t concern them, and all different kinds of things about them that help me learn different ways to be,” Shap said.
Looking at her exhibit, the viewer encounters a wide variety of characters: a nun, Shap’s mother, artist Ed Ruscha and a woman from India donning a flowing Sari.
As diverse as her subjects seem at first glance, they all share space in Shap’s curious mind.
“My parents both survived the Holocaust from Nazi Germany and were highly protective of their little girl in particular … and really limited my contact with people outside of our family,” Shap said. “It was just a very tight family unit. I really had the need to know more about life and other people and that’s really the seed behind my direction as a painter.”
Not only does Shap’s work show diversity in the characters she chooses to paint, she explores a variety of media to achieve her goal.
When oil paint alone doesn’t suit her needs, Shap will fuse photography with oil painting.
“The media that I use have to do with portraying the textures that are present with the subject,” Shap said. “Sometimes the mixed media may have to do with wanting to show the individual textures … Maybe the person has dry skin, so maybe I’ll use a pencil on a board and some pastels because it might show that kind of skin a bit better. Someone with richer skin … I might use oil.”
Shap’s affinity for portraits began decades ago; her love for art began at age six with painting and drawing.

“My older brother, Ron, who was an extremely gifted painter and taught me how to paint and draw when I was very young,” Shap said. “He took time to teach me how to paint and draw, otherwise I don’t believe I ever would have.”
In addition to the training she received from her brother, Shap drew from major artistic forces that were gaining attention as she matured as an artist.
“As I was growing up, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, their work came along. I started to have a different point of view, in terms of how I saw things and composed my subjects,” she said. “The colors that I would begin to use were all influenced by their very contemporary viewpoint where all along my training was more classical.”
Shap’s work embodies the curious mind.
Perspective, color, emotion and detail are just the most basic aspects of her stunning work.
By learning about others and painting them, Shap learns about herself.
“It’s very important to me to try to extract as much as possible from other people’s experience so that I might not have to go through some of them or I might be able to go through some of them in a better way than I would otherwise,” she said.
Shap’s works have appeared in LACMA and her portrait of Los Angeles Master Chorale founder Roger Wagner is currently on display at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
The exhibition will be on display at the Fisher Museum on campus until April 9.

California is known for being ahead of the curve on all things green. We liberally apply endless variations of the word ‘trailblazer’ to the state’s environmental policy and usually assume that if some new trend in sustainability is taking the nation by storm, California got there first.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Apparently that’s not always the case, in California or at USC.
The U.S. Green Building Council recently named the top 10 states “with so-called green commercial and institutional structures,” according to the Los Angeles Times. Basically, the states that are the most aggressive in making their buildings LEED-certified.
California, surprisingly enough, didn’t make the cut.
This doesn’t mean California has thrown in the towel when it comes to sustainability so much as it indicates that other states are stepping up their game. And at USC, the drive for LEED-certified buildings seems to tell the same story.
USC, like California as a whole, is making progress, but it’s no longer enough to be doing the minimum. Other colleges and other states are completing more projects at a faster pace, and USC is being left behind.
In the wake of the successful certification of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, USC Sustainability pledged all future construction on campus be held to LEED standards.
USC is far from being the only college with such a goal.
The University of Washington and the University of California, Santa Barbara have seven and eight LEED-certified buildings, respectively, and colleges across the nation have made similar or more extensive pledges.
Instead of waiting on new construction for the opportunity to lessen campus’ carbon footprint, USC could implement LEED-inspired standards in more of its existing buildings.
Yes, some criteria for certification, such as choosing a sustainable construction site, aren’t realistic for existing structures. But numerous others, such as ‘energy & atmosphere’ (which refers mostly to electricity conservation), and ‘water efficiency’ (self-explanatory) call for mostly topical changes to existing building fixtures and would require no extensive overhaul.
Although such improvements wouldn’t earn a building a full certification, they would certainly improve the environmental impact of the building.
Since USC is prepared to pay the full price for future projects, it should also be able to afford some interim measures.
California, meanwhile, might be better served  by just ensuring that as many future projects as possible are up to code.
Granted, now might not be the best time to spend pocket change on water filters. Instead, California’s government should instead focus on the bigger picture.
The advantages of LEED certification are hard to deny.
According to the U.S. Green Building Council website, LEED-certified structures are healthier for occupants, can decrease production of landfill waste and even have financial benefits like tax rebates and lower operating costs within the building itself. In short, these structures are worth investing in.
The colleges outdoing USC in LEED-certifications have, in general, less money and fewer resources, just as California is getting shown up by smaller states in less geographically-desirable parts of the country.
It’s time for both to up their commitment.

The Republican Congress has recently taken to attacking discretionary spending with a buzzsaw, and one of the centerpiece cuts in its proposed budget is the elimination of government funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The move is merely the latest development in a long, bitter relationship between public television and the political right.
Though the CPB is an inviting, low-hanging fruit for budget hawks to target, cutting its funding is a politically harmful move, not only because the CPB enjoys broad public support, but also because public broadcasting is aligned with many classically conservative ideals.
Public television serves an important role in our society, one that is difficult to quantify monetarily.
Educational shows like Sesame Street teach children important values such as respect for others; public interest journalism from the likes of NewsHour and Frontline is the standard of unbiased reporting free of any agenda.
Shows like California’s Gold and Antiques Roadshow encourage a sense of pride in our great country’s history.
These programs are pillars of public television, an institution portrayed by many as a bastion of liberal propaganda. An editorial in the Washington Times called the CPB “a Great Society-era big-government dinosaur.” Opponents portray it as a parasite feeding off taxpayer dollars, or “the Muppet Lobby,” in the words of Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.).
Other conservative representatives are more guarded in their criticism.
Rep. David Dreier (R-Calif.) professes to be a loyal fan of NPR and PBS, but said  America cannot afford the $451 million that go to the CPB every year. Apparently it has become politically safe to say  “viewers like you” should pick up the tab instead of Uncle Sam.
The CPB would be a valuable head to hang on the wall for Republicans seeking to appease their political base.
But although budget-obsessed tea partiers might see PBS as a neon target for drastic cuts, public television is a fundamental element in modern American society, and it deserves our public investment.
The big networks used to be bound by law to carry public interest programming in exchange for the right to broadcast on the publicly owned airwaves.
Networks gradually threw off those shackles as they realized the real profit was found in TV’s ability to sell, rather than in its status as a service.
They learned some customers are more valuable than others and began to value the demographics that were most susceptible to commercial messages. TV content became homogenous and less innovative.
Public television, for the most part, never traveled down that dangerous, slippery slope. Public interest news shows continued to cover issues they considered valuable, instead of fixating on the color of an Oscar nominee’s dress or Charlie Sheen’s mental state.
Sesame Street, Barney and Arthur continue to educate children about the values of kindness and understanding instead of simply drawing young minds from one commercial break to the next.
Several generations have now grown up with PBS, learning about the universe on Nova and tuning in to see Mr. Rogers tell us we all are special, just the way we are.
PBS will survive defunding by the federal government, but it might lose its public mission in the process. Profitable shows like Sesame Street and Nova will continue, but their success will not subsidize public interest programs such as Frontline and will not balance the books of small rural stations that rely on federal funds to serve their communities.
Public broadcasting has become an inexorable and priceless pillar of American life, and if we sacrifice it for the purpose of a few saved pennies, we will have sold a piece of ourselves in the process.

So how do you propose to pay for it?
Oh yeah. By sending the bill to MY CHILDREN.
Stop racking up debts that you expect others to pay for, and then we’ll talk about spending priorities. Deal?
NPR & CPB are small potatoes when you look at the overall budget. However, the federal government has taken to overspending MONTHLY revenues the by more than the ANNUAL budget of California. We are no longer so rich that we can afford such luxuries as these. We need to break loose these government sponsored entities and require them to pay their fair share of taxes like other broadcasters and corporations.
I like cowboy poetry?  Doesn’t everybody???
I miss our local KCET station which used to play mystery theater, and all kinds of concerts.
It’s a shame more people can’t appreciate public television which is such a tiny miniscule part of the budget. 
Thanks for the article.
jennifer rose
Yes, and let’s be sure we keep funding cowboy poetry, too.
The axe has to fall, my young friend, and NPR and CPB are wonderful places to cut. Let the free market sort out which programming will survive. I daresay that if there is an audience for Frontline type programming (and there is), those brave journalists will find work.
You youngsters have had your minds so filled with leftist mush by your unionized teachers and left-wing professors that you can’t see straight. I find these DT editorial pieces endlessly amazing – that they can consistently produce such a lockstep left-wing view of the world. It’s astonishing! Are none of you brave enough to think for yourselves?
sesame street, arthur, and barney- teaching our kid morals??? How about the fact that these programs are really there to set up false idols to our impressionable youth- a golden calf for the modern age, if you will.
what is barney, but a large, homosexual, talking lizard?
DOWN with BARNEY, DOWN with SESAME STREET,DOWN with ARTHUR, the talking anteater!!!

The USC women’s water polo team headed to Berkeley this past weekend, hoping to prove Its worth in its quest for another national championship.
The match, however, did not reflect one of a championship-caliber team as the Women of Troy (9-3, 1-1) fell to California, 8-3.
Cal goalie Stephanie Peckham put in a stellar performance with 20 saves, and the Women of Troy simply couldn’t get shots past her. The first half of the game went by with each side’s defense taking control. The Bears (15-3, 3-0) held USC to one goal during the entire half, and scored three themselves. At halftime, the scoreboard ready 3-1 in favor the Bears.
The second half was all about the Golden Bears. They only allowed one goal per frame, and scored five on the Women of Troy.
USC wasn’t able to rally or get anything going in the hopes of making the second half a close game.
None of the Women of Troy had more than a goal, and the only three players to score were junior two-meter Kara-Leigh Huse, junior driver Nadia Dan and senior two-meter Sarah Van Norman.
In its wins where USC has had at least seven or eight girls scoring (two or three them contributing multiple scores as well), this game was not typical for the team.
Pair this with the great performance by Cal’s Peckham, and the USC offense struggled all day to string together any offense.
This upcoming weekend brings the Women of Troy back home for two matches with one MPSF match against Arizona State on Friday evening, and another against UC Irvine on Saturday.

Coming off of a tough loss to UCLA on Tuesday, the USC women’s tennis team battled back from an early hole to beat Washington soundly 6-1, earning them its first Pac-10 win.
“I give [Washington] a lot of credit,” said USC coach Richard Gallien. “They won the four first singles sets [after a 3-0 defeat in doubles], and we weren’t laughing and joking when we headed in to halftime.”
Despite what the score indicates, the Women of Troy (8-2, 1-0) were tested throughout the match.
In a rare sign of weakness, senior Maria Sanchez was defeated by Washington’s Denise Dy in the first set, 6-2. Dy, the nation’s No. 6-ranked player, had Sanchez on her heels throughout the entire match.
Despite the setback, Sanchez, the nation’s No. 2 player, fought back using her dominant serve to swing the momentum back in her favor.
Sanchez ultimately put away the match, which was punctuated by an ace on the game-winning point.
“Heading into the match we knew [Washington] can play with anyone in the country at No. 1 and No. 2,” Gallien said. “[Dy] is very good and is easily one of the nation’s top players.”
Sanchez would also win her doubles match along with freshman Kaitlyn Christian against doubles pair Dy and Chan 8-7 (3). The No. 20-ranked Christian and Sanchez duo came back after being down 1-6 earlier in the match.
“I love playing with Maria,” Christian said. “She’s a banger and I love to move and be aggressive at the net so we complement each other so well out there.”
Christian bounced back from a loss in Westwood with a resounding 6-3, 6-2 defeating Samantha Smith in the third singles match.
“She was mentally very strong and she was just on it today,” Gallien said.
Junior Alison Ramos broke out of her singles’ slump after her comeback victory against Aleksandra Krsljanin 4-6, 6-4, 1-0 (10-4) in the No. 5 slot.
After enduring a series of heart-breaking losses that included two tie-breaker losses, it as good to see Ramos win in such climactic fashion, since she’ll be counted on in Pac-10 play and beyond.
On the four court, sophomore Valeria Pulido picked up a heavyhearted victory 3-6, 5-2 after the Huskies’ Andjela Nemcevic had to retire due to an apparent leg injury midway through the second set.
After clawing back from 0-4 to build some momentum for the second set, Pulido seemed to have the match in hand before Nemcevic was beset with the injury.
Junior Danielle Lao, ranked No. 18, lost the final match of the day on court two in a gut-wrenching manner 7-6 (2), 7-6 (6) to No. 27 Venise Chan. Lao took hold of the second set going up 6-5, but both mental and physical fatigue seemed to get the best of her as Chan would take the final three games.
Senior Cristala Andrews finished off Washington’s Vanja Radunovic 6-1, 6-1 to open up the winning on the USC side in the singles department.
Up next for the Women of Troy is a match against Pepperdine in Malibu on Saturday, March 12 at noon.

Washington State junior and Pac-10 scoring leader Klay Thompson is in hot water with his coaches after being charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana on Thursday, but there’s someone else who’s upset with him: his dad, Lakers broadcaster Mychal Thompson.
Mychal Thompson spoke openly about the incident on a Friday morning AM 710 ESPN sports-radio show, calling the news “a punch to the gut — or even lower.”
“I thought he was better than that,” Mychal Thompson told the audience. “I want to hug my son and I want to punch his lights out. Or do both. I’m just so mad. Maybe he’s too old to be spanked, just turning 21 a month ago, but I sure do feel like spanking him.”
Pullman, Wash., police pulled the younger Thompson’s GMC Envoy over near Washington State’s campus at 11 p.m. for a broken headlight on Thursday, hours after he put up 22 points in Washington State’s 85-77 victory over USC. A police spokesman told ESPN that officers smelled marijuana, and though Klay Thompson denied having any, 1.95 grams were found in the vehicle. Klay Thompson was then cited with the misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession.
He was suspended for Saturday’s regular-season finale against UCLA — which the Cougars lost in overtime, 58-54 — a game many considered to be crucial for the on-the-bubble Washington State team’s postseason hopes.
“He let down the whole school, his coach, his teammates, the students,” his father said on Friday. “He didn’t have the maturity and responsible behavior to know what this game means to Washington State.”
Before Friday’s game, Klay Thompson apologized to the crowd gathered at Friel Court. Washington State coach Ken Bone told The Daily Evergreen that the action was the player’s idea.
“It’s something that he wanted to do,” Bone said. “I, and we as a team, are proud of the fact that he said what he said to the crowd. I think it came from the heart.”
Klay Thompson’s status for the remainder of the season has yet to be determined, Bone added, though Mychal Thompson said it would be “deserving” if his son missed the rest of the season, which might be the NBA prospect’s final one at the collegiate level.
“He’ll have to walk around campus now with a scarlet ‘N’ on his forehead,” Mychal Thompson said. “It’s a huge mistake.”
In January, Washington State guard Reggie Moore point guard was suspended for a game after marijuana was found in his dorm room.
