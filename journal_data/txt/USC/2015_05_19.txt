On Memorial Day weekend, the Do LaB will take Bradley, California, by storm with its five-day Lightning in a Bottle Music Festival. This isn’t just any year though — the annual eco-friendly, electric dance music festival, started in 2006 by brothers Dede, Jesse and Josh Flemming will be celebrating its ten-year anniversary.
The Flemming brothers got their start from a party in the mountains, but have since grown significantly.  Do LaB Along with LiB, the trio also hosts a soundstage at Coachella. Dede said they didn’t have a long-term goal in mind when they launched LiB, but are happy where they have ended up — as more than just a music festival.
“We wanted to focus LiB more towards conscious living, but we wanted it to be a balance,” Dede said. “We’ve been really good about providing great music and also making the festival eco-friendly and offering classes on cooking, yoga and meditation. We didn’t want the focus to just be about partying.”
It seems to be working. Dede said many attendees tell him that the festival changed their life and perspective.
“I can’t speak to why or how this festival is transformative to its goers, everything about it is a very personal experience. We’ve created a unique platform that allows people to express who they really are,” he said. “They get to experience other people and new friendships bloom in new ways they certainly aren’t used to. We are giving them room to be exposed to what else is out there, and it’s always something positive. There naturally isn’t any negativity or judgmnts on our festival grounds.”
The festival has not only affected festival goers, but also the lives of its founders.
“This has been my life for the last 10 years,” Dede said. “I’ve worked incredibly hard with my team day in and day out, and I’ve been more involved with the business side of things. After working so hard and for so long, you start to lose sight of what you’re doing it for. Its so much work and the goal can often get foggy. The only thing that snaps me back and reminds me what I do this for is the people that come out to these events and hearing about their experiences. After one person tells me, ‘This changed my life and I’ve never been happier,’ is when everything just clicks.”
Not everyone is always comfortable when first entering the festival. Along with festival returners are a group of new people often not entirely sure they know what they are getting into.
“It’s neat to see people open up. When we have these newcomers enter the festival and are a bit nervous to begin with, we watch how the majority of everyone else rub off on them and open them up,” Dede said. “We keep converting just a few more people each and every year, and we see the difference it makes in their lives after.”
Those who are converted are joining a community of equals — Lightning in a Bottle does one thing differently that not many festivals agree with: there’s no VIP area. Flemming believes removing a VIP area from the grounds is what helps build the community. There’s an importance in building a residency for the weekend with people who are willing to live together.
“You can’t build a community if we have segregation. We are all one, and we are all here to celebrate,” Dede said.

Since the beginning of my study abroad semester in February, I have been continuously surprised by the diversity of Buenos Aires.  Not only does this city have a passionate and proud Argentine culture, but it also has a huge population of expats who call this cosmopolitan metropolis their home.  The combination of the rich history and culture along with the influences of many immigrants from all around the world creates an incredible melting pot where just about anyone can find their niche.
This week just about marks the halfway point of my study abroad semester in B.A. As I look back on all of the unique experiences I’ve had thus far, I see one major unifier to all of these different adventures — culture. Whether it has been places I have explored, food I have eaten or people I have encountered, all have revolved around culture.
Two distinct experiences this past weekend helped me see the different ways culture plays a role in this city. On Saturday, a Mexican cultural fair helped me see the importance of the immigrant communities in Argentina. The next day, a day-long visit to an “estancia,” a countryside estate or ranch,  showed me that while new influences continue to emerge in this city, the people of this country proudly preserve their heritage.
For the past several weekends there has been a rotation of different cultural fairs hosted by the city and the different cultural associations. This past Saturday my housemates and I attended “Buenos Aires Celebra México,” a Mexican cultural fair hosted by México en Argentina Asociación Civil. This event had booths lining the sidewalks with tons of different traditional Mexican dishes and artisanal crafts for sale, as well as a huge performance stage and seating area.  It was incredible to see the number of people in the crowd singing along to the mariachis and chanting, “Viva Mexico, viva Argentina!” at every opportunity.
After a little while of watching from behind the seating area, my friends and I couldn’t hold back, and we decided to join the crowd dancing in front of the stage. We were invited to join the crowd in traditional dances as we linked arms with strangers who encouraged us to chant and sing along. The MC introduced each new act by leading the crowd in a resounding, “Viva México, viva Argentina!”  Sharing in this celebration, it was instantly clear that everyone present not only had an immense appreciation and a sense of pride for their Mexican culture, but also loved their home, Argentina.
Then, on Sunday, after months of many different city tours and museum visits that covered the general history and cultural origins of Buenos Aires, I was able to get my own taste of what Argentine life might have been like more than 100 years ago.  My exchange program took me to an “estancia,” which is a word used to describe private landholdings and can be compared to a ranch.  These estates have a rich history in Argentina and are where many families established their wealth through raising livestock such as cattle and horses.  During my day at “Estancia La Mimosa,” the owner and his family shared with us their traditions that have been preserved and passed down since its founding in 1869.  We toured the grounds and the house and rode horses before seeing the amazing “asado” lunch, a barbecue social event traditional in Argentina, that they had prepared for us.  This led to a two-hour eating experience trying the home prepared “parrilla” or barbeque, which is a tradition that many Argentine families still regularly partake in on Sundays.
In addition to the incredible chorizo, chicken and steak prepared from their farm animals, the family shared their traditional dances with us while dressed in appropriate costume. The dances included the tango and other folk dances.  This was an incredible way to truly appreciate the origins of the infamous Argentine asado and experience a proper one for myself out in the countryside.
My experiences this weekend are just a few of the many distinct insights I’ve had to the incredible mix of cultures that exist in this city.  Buenos Aires is the second largest metropolitan city in South America after Greater Sao Paulo.  It is remarkable to see how many expats from all different nations have come to call B.A. their home.  This is not only apparent in people all over the city but also in the representation of different restaurants, shops and festivals that are all over the city. Not only do I get to experience the Argentine culture on a daily basis through interaction with my classmates, their families, professors and adventures in the city, but I am also learning about other cultures through my unique living situation.
When it comes to my living situation, I truly hit the jackpot. I live with 10 other students from 10 different countries, and I am constantly learning about the traditions and cultures of these many places. My housemates hail from England, France, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Honduras, Venezuela, Brazil and Guatemala — in fact, I am the only American. Though I knew I would learn so much about Argentine culture from living in the city, I did not expect to be so lucky to have this insight as well.  My living situation has been one of the best and most unexpected parts of my abroad experience.  Simply by sharing stories about our families and home lives, as well as our universities and friends, I have gained insight to many new perspectives.
From Argentines, to expats, to exchange students, I have glimpsed many different cultures and seen what it can be like when they all come together. As I continue to have these encounters I think of my home, Los Angeles, knowing that we are also lucky to have a strong influence of many immigrants but also feeling that the potential and appreciation for it is not yet tapped.  My wish for the United States, and L.A. in particular, is that someday we can embrace the many cultural influences to a much greater degree than currently exists.  Not only should we celebrate and appreciate the different backgrounds of each community, but we should also take the time to learn and understand each other’s history and traditions.
This story is the first in a series about Trojans traveling internationally over the summer.
That’s what I’m talking about. I give mad respect to anyone who goes to college to diversify themselves and worry about other things going on in this world besides just worrying about grades, graduating, and career advancement. Thank you Alana Victor for this article. And yes you’re right, Los Angeles needs to do a better job on educating its residents on the different cultures that exist here.

On May 15, a coalition of 64 organizations filed a federal discrimination complaint against one of the most renowned Ivy League colleges, Harvard University. According to the organizations, Harvard discriminated against an unnamed rejected applicant who scored perfectly on standardized tests and was an AP Scholar. In addition to perfect test scores, the applicant was also involved in extracurricular activities such as being a volunteer fundraiser for National Public Radio and the captain of the varsity tennis team. This particular case of rejection of a worthy applicant has been related to the longstanding concern of various organizations about the suspicious admission process and the potential use of the quota system.
The coalition bolstered its allegation by providing admission statistics, claiming that among all the students who applied to the top three Ivy League colleges between 2008 and 2012, more than 27 percent were Asian Americans, and yet they only made up of 17 to 20 percent of admitted students. According to the Atlantic, this disparity is severely unreasonable considering that in 2008, around 46 percent of the applicants were Asian Americans, and the majority of these Asian American applicants had the same credentials as other admitted students.
With such statistical evidence, the coalition managed to compare Harvard’s supposed quota system with the one used in the 20th century to make the college admission process harder for the Jews. In comparing the academic scores of an admitted and a rejected applicant, however, the coalition fails to consider the qualitative information that forms a critical aspect of evaluation during the admissions process
In defense of Harvard, Robert Iuliano, Harvard’s general counsel, stated that “the college considers each applicant through an individualized, holistic review having the goal of creating a vibrant academic community that exposes students to a wide-range of differences: background, ideas, experiences, talents and aspirations.” Additionally, Asian American students continue to comprise a higher percentage of enrolled students than Hispanics, Latinos or African Americans. Therefore, the coalition has a serious reason to reconsider its accusation.
In an interview, Thomas Espenshade, an economist and Princeton University researcher whose research was cited by the coalition, stated that more evidence is required to strengthen the racial discrimination case against Harvard since the admissions process is not just based on the academic success of an applicant. Failure to consider essays or teacher recommendations as possible options for bridging the gap between the admitted and the rejected students is likely to lead to such skeptical assumptions. Furthermore,  a growing number of colleges review applications without considering the test scores first. Therefore, the organizations that filed the complaint against Harvard might have overestimated the importance of test scores and failed to recognize other justifiable reasons for a failure to accept the applicant. Applicants can never be sure whether Harvard has rejected perfectly scored applicants based on their ethnicity or based on their essays and recommendations. These other aspects of the applications, however, should be considered for the discrimination case to hold true.
Harvard has, in fact, taken steps to promote diversity.  Harvard hosts the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, which helps to expand the diversity of incoming classes by encouraging minority students to apply  to the university. By arranging on-campus and overnight visits, special information sessions and tours, the program ensures that the enrolled students benefit from diversity and have enough opportunities to foster a globalized approach to education and enhance their intelligence.
By realizing the importance of diversity and introducing such programs, Harvard is making an effort to enrich its cultural variety. The level of geographic diversity at Harvard is far above the national average, as shown by its No.10  nationwide geographic diversity ranking. The statistics strongly suggest that Harvard does not practice gender, racial or any other sort of discrimination.
On the university’s end, a possible permanent solution to the doubts of the critics can be found by eliminating the option for students to fill out their ethnic backgrounds in applications. Nevertheless, this might not be enough to silence the critically developed minds of people who manage to spot problems in even the fairest of processes.
I have to agree with bjuardo. Look, quietly, college admissions officers get sick and tired of reviewing applications of students who just achieve high grades and high test scores and with run of the mill personal statement essays. I have grown up around Asians for many years as a suburban-areas elementary, junior high, high school, and college student.
And I have to say like bjuardo intimated, a lot of Asian students that I went/are  going to school with were/are obsessed with grades, facts and figures for school, career advancement and little effort to diversify their friend and socialization circles.
Then as a Los Angeles resident, I make constant trips up to East Los Angeles College, USC and UCLA which are schools dominated by Asian students. And the Asian students that go to those schools are afraid to make eye contact with people, you never see them hang out with other students outside their race, and when they get in groups for class they either work alone or only with Asian students.
You have to blame Asian parents for a lot of their own kids lack of diversity. Their parents come from the old school and instill in their kids to go to school and work hard and get a job after or during college; and lacking is their effort to take their kids around people and around cultural events or societies that have nothing to do with Asian culture.
I knew this guy who has a biracial (Black father and White mother) son, and he said he sent his kid to school as a teenager at a school that was predominately Asian students. He said those Asian students ignored his son for about 95 percent of the school year and only mingled mostly with their own race. Stuff like that doesn’t surprise me.
Asian parents and their children have to realize that there is more to life than grades, tests, facts and figures, career advancement, and being insulated in their own Asian culture. Because their success with dealing with the people in the real world and college admissions depends on it.
The Asian community is slowing finding a voice that the black community found long ago in terms of protest and letting their voices be known.  Unless the Asian community voices up like it is now, folks will try to use the argument of “holistic” and “well rounded” as a form of denying and legitimizing admissions.  Thanks to a study by UCLA, extracirricular and leadership skills between Asians and other groups show no difference.  The only way these quotas will stop is when Harvard sees that there will be backlash and consequences and pressure just as the black community has been able to do.  
You got to look at it optimistically there, Asian students. First of all, undergrad, whether it be at Harvard or commensurate, doesn’t guarantee you squat wrt jobs. Sure, high profile companies would probably hire a “Harvard” grad over some grad from a lesser school, but these are high profile companies we’re talking about. And high profile companies don’t automatically give you 6-figure job offers with an undergrad degree, just because it’s from a high profile school. 
I think Asian students need to build their “social stock” more so than the book-smarts. A lot of Asian people are brought up in an insulated, coddled lifestyle prior to college. There’s no diversity or adversity in their upbringing. Most Asians live in upper middle class to affluent white suburbs. This sort of insular upbringing emotionally stunts you. 
The “underrepresented” minorities i.e. blacks and browns who do get admitted to Harvard aren’t the bottom of the barrel applicants. Sure, their academic stats may not be as impressive in contrast to an Asian student’s, but it’s enough to merit them admission. 
Asian students, think of the bigger picture. Go to Harvard and commensurate for grad school e.g. law, medical, research, and so forth. Undergrad is overrated.
The Asian community is slowing finding a voice that the black community found long ago in terms of protest and letting their voices be known.  Unless the Asian community voices up like it is now, folks will try to use the argument of “holistic” and “well rounded” as a form of denying and legitimizing admissions.  Thanks to a study by UCLA, extracirricular and leadership skills between Asians and other groups show no difference.
Face palm*
So if you got into Harvard or commensurate, because admissions looked strictly at the numbers and no “sob stories” (personal statement), then that means your future is propitious? People like you incessantly ignore my message by not repudiating  the big picture in all this.
Yeah, protest this indignant matter…..I instead, would take it in stride, go to whatever college accepted me, and look for every angle to experience success. Undergrad is overrated….Yeah, falling on deaf ears again.
Is diversity so great a goal that is should trump judgement? Should it trump a private organization from choosing its members? Why exactly is diversity so great? The most successful socialist countries have nearly zero diversity.

The cancellation of USC’s end-of-the-year Fountain Run tradition led to the creation of multiple alternatives for seniors to celebrate their impending graduation.
For nearly a decade, students participated in the unofficial Fountain Run tradition which was not sanctioned by the university. On the evening of the last Thursday of spring semester classes, graduating seniors would run through every fountain on campus.
The Fountain Run was canceled this year, however, because according to university administrators, it had become too dangerous for students and too damaging to campus property. Assistant Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard said that in the past five years, there have been 73 medical calls and 25 ambulance rides during the Fountain Run, most of which were caused by alcohol-related incidents. Last year’s campus destruction from the Fountain Run included biohazardous materials in the fountains, broken fixtures and significant damage to the Youth Triumphant statue  in total, almost $50,000 in property damages.
Some students were disappointed by the cancellation. Nicole Daviau, a rising senior majoring in business administration, was upset by the cancellation of the Fountain Run because she wanted to celebrate the college careers of her graduating friends.
“It seems unfair. When the seniors leave, the Fountain Run is often what they say is the greatest thing they did at USC, even if they’ve studied abroad or did something really cool throughout their years here,” Daviau said. “I feel like I was being robbed of an experience.”
As an alternative, the administration Student Affairs hosted the Senior Run, on April 30.
“[T]his year, USC Student Affairs launched an educational campaign informing students of the dangers and destruction that this unsanctioned event causes,” Allard wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Our approach was to inform students about the facts while simultaneously supporting student leaders in creating a new, fully sanctioned that was termed the ‘Senior Run.’”
The event, which was led by Undergraduate Student Government, Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council and Residential Student Government, was a festival that included inflatables, music, food trucks and giveaways.
Approximately 1,500 students picked up wristbands, which were required to attend the Senior Run. Because of the large attendance, Allard said she was hopeful that the event grows in years to come.
“We are looking to the campus’ student leaders to continue to invest their time and energy in coordinating this as a new tradition,” Allard wrote. “USC Student Affairs believes that celebrating the culmination of years of students’ hard work is important. Even more important is celebrating while keeping our community safe.”
Students also attempted to organize another alternative to the Fountain Run — an Undie Run. Also held on April 30, the Undie Run event was created on Facebook as a response to the Fountain Run’s cancellation. The Facebook page instructed attendees to meet at Tommy Trojan at 10:30 p.m. dressed in undergarments. Daviau felt it could be a good alternative to the Fountain Run.
“As a commuter and transfer student, it can be hard to find a sense of community on campus and feel really connected to the Trojan Family … But something that comes up for most people is that the Fountain Run gives them that sense of community,” she said. “The Undie Run could have replaced what was taken away.”
When the night of the run arrived, however, the student-organized event was too uncoordinated to take off.
“When people got there, [they] set off running in opposite directions because there was no map or plan on where to go,” Daviau said. “There was not enough information to the students, so at the given time, some people ran forward about 10 feet and then stopped and ran back because they were confused.”
Some people congregated around the meeting area, a few of which were also attending the Senior Run. When the running did not happen, people eventually left.
“There was an underlying sadness during the Undie Run because there was that lack of cohesion. I really hope in the upcoming years that we come up with something to celebrate our years here,” Daviau said.

The seven master of fine arts students that make up the Roski School of Art and Design’s class of 2016 announced on Friday that they are leaving the university as a result of grievances they have with the program’s funding and curriculum.
“Because the University refused to honor its promises to us, we are returning to the workforce degree-less and debt-full,” the students wrote in a statement published online.
The MFA program at Roski is a full-time, two-year interdisciplinary program. The seven master’s candidates — Julie Beaufils, Sid Duenas, George Egerton-Warburton, Edie Fake, Lauren Davis Fisher, Lee Relvas and Ellen Schafer — announced that they are dissolving their candidacies as a result of what they feel were false promises made by the university.
According to the students, upon admittance, the Roski administration promised them a partial scholarship for first-year tuition, and upon completing their first year, the students would receive full-tuition for their second year, benefits, a stipend and a teaching assistantship. The former students said they were the first class since 2011 to acquire debt to attend Roski and the first group of students since 2006 that did not have teaching experience after their first year in the program.
The students blamed Roski Dean Erica Muhl, appointed to the position in May 2013, for the cuts to program funding.
“At every single turn, the dean and every other administrator we interacted with tried to delegitimize and belittle our real concerns, repeatedly framing us as ‘demanding’ simply for advocating for those things the School had already promised us,” the students wrote.
In response to the allegations that Muhl and other administrators were stripping the master’s program of funding to finance more well-known programs with greater name value, Muhl said that the program has and continues to financially support its students as promised upon admission.
“The USC Roski MFA program remains one of the most generously funded programs in the country,” Muhl wrote in a statement. “These students would have received a financial package worth at least 90 percent of tuition costs in scholarships and teaching assistantships.”
Muhl was criticized by the students in the written statement for her lack of experience with visual arts.
“She, along with Roski’s various vice and assistant deans, made it clear to our class that they did not value the program’s faculty structure, pedagogy or standing in the arts community, the very same elements that had attracted us as potential students,” the students wrote.
Aside from the students that have decided to leave, several Roski faculty members have also opted to leave the university in recent months including the former program director A.L. Steiner, who stepped down in November as director and whose contract was not renewed by USC as of May 15.  Additionally, in February, the graduate coordinator Dwayne Moser left the university, and in December, tenured Roski professor of painting and drawing Frances Stark left the university for unknown reasons.
Though she would not discuss the reasons for her parting ways with the university, Stark wrote in a statement to the Los Angeles Times that she supported the students in their decision to withdraw from the program.
“The students are correct in terms of funding, curriculum, and faculty structure,” she wrote in the statement. “All changed in relation to the program they agreed to enter.”
Though the students are no longer enrolled in the program, they wrote in their statement that they plan to continue to collaborate artistically.
“The MFA Program we entered in August 2014 did one great thing: it threw us all together, when we might not have crossed paths on our own,” they wrote.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that former program director A.L. Steiner is currently still employed at USC. She is actually not employed at USC. The university did not renew his contract as of May 15. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Wet weather wasn’t enough to keep thousands of graduates, families and friends from celebrating the class of 2015 on May 15 at the 132nd annual commencement ceremony.
More than 15,000 students earned degrees, with six honorary degrees bestowed on leaders in the health, law, business and the arts and entertainment industries. Honorees included Pete Carroll, head coach of the Seattle Seahawks and former USC head football coach; Kamala D. Harris, the first South Asian and African American to be elected Attorney General of California; Leonard D. Schaeffer, chief executive of Wellpoint insurance company; Michael Tilson Thomas, director of the San Francisco Symphony; and Ada Yonath, Nobel Prize winner for Chemistry in 2009.  Commencement speaker Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, also received an honorary degree from the university.
Many speakers touched on the idea of love as a means of providing a foundation for developing great minds as well as a source for ingenuity and innovation.
In his speech, the class of 2015 valedictorian, Alexander Yuen, stressed the love of family and friends as the most important factor for helping him to develop into the person he is today.
“We have all been young lions,” he said. “At some point in our life full of zealous but ultimately empty pride. Our parents and guardians, friends and loved ones have tempered us to be the better people we are today.”
The ceremony’s keynote address was given by Hobson, director of companies such as the Starbucks Company, Dreamworks Animation, Groupon and the Estee Lauder Company, who overcame numerous obstacles to become the president of money marketing firm Ariel Investments, which holds more than $10 billion in its portfolio.
Hobson compared her journey to success, as well as the challenges facing the graduating class, to the story of skydiver Felix Baumgartner, who jumped out of a lightweight space capsule 24 miles from the Earth.
“The world may look bigger than it ever looked,” she said. “And you may feel smaller than you have ever felt.”
The solution to this fear, according to Hobson, is bravery.
“Bravery allows us to push beyond the boundaries that hold us back from living the lives that we want,” she said.
Hobson continued to emphasize the importance of bravery as a means of succeeding in everything at life, including love.
“A lot of graduation speeches will encourage you to be passionate about something,” she emphasized. “I am going to encourage you to be passionate about someone.”
In reference to her husband, Star Wars director and USC alumnus George Lucas, Hobson noted that love has provided her with a soul mate and a friend — and she encouraged students to find someone who can do the same for them.
“It took me a long time to be as brave in my personal life as I was in my professional life,” she emphasized. “That’s because to be brave in love, you must open yourself up to the possibility of heartbreak.”
Despite her fear, Hobson took the plunge and said that she realized that bravery continued to be the key for finding purpose and happiness in all things.
“That is my hope for you,” Hobson said. “That you will be brave and you will be loved.”
Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life, opened the main ceremony, with a speech about finding significance in life. Taking inspiration from a 75-year longitudinal psychological study, he said that the purpose of life is not found in fame or monetary success.
“The researchers concluded the same thing that four young lads from Liverpool told us nearly 50 years ago,” Soni said. “All you need is love.”
President C. L. Max Nikias urged students to go into the future, not with a spirit of fear — but with bravery and excitement.
“What is uncertainty but the beginning of a great adventure?” Nikias asked graduates.
Following the main ceremony, graduates attended satellite ceremonies depending on their major hosted by the various schools on campus.

Ram Devineni, a New York-based filmmaker, has developed a new way to combat rape in India. He has created a comic book named Priya’s Shakti, which tells the story of a young woman who was raped and her quest to fight for gender equality in Indian society. Though many might question the ethics of using a comic book to address such a sensitive issue, Devineni’s comic book might be what India needs to change the social attitudes toward sexual violence.
Devineni was born in India but raised in New Jersey. Following the gang rape that took place on a Dehli bus in 2012, Devineni traveled to India and interviewed men on the street, asking them about what they thought of the incident. To Devineni’s surprise, most of the men responded with answers that blamed the young woman for the rape.
According to a BBC article, one police officer told Devineni, “no good girl walks home alone at night.” It was then that Devineni became aware of the deeply rooted tradition of victim blaming in India. The realization prompted him to write a comic book in order to raise awareness about the dangers and negative effects of gender inequality and sexual violence.
What makes the comic book successful is its objective to bring about social change. Since 2012, many laws have been enforced to decrease the number of rape cases. Unfortunately, not much is likely to change because this is an issue rooted in the society’s culture. In India, when women are victims of rape, it is fairly common for family members to shun them. If the people themselves don’t realize that sexual violence is wrong, there is not much that law enforcement can do to diminish it. For there to be changes to the way women are treated in India, social attitudes must shift. Fortunately, this is precisely what Devineni’s comic, Priya’s Shakti, has gradually achieved.
Priya’s Shakti has brought about social change because of its appeal to a younger audience. When Devineni wrote the comic book, he intended to target teenagers. The main character, Priya, is just like them. She has a dream, and she faces many of the same issues that teenagers in India encounter, such as discouragement from pursuing an education because she is a woman. Once audiences develop an emotional tie to Priya, they become more likely to question the injustice that Priya faces as a result of sexual assult.
The comic book is also powerful because of the authority Devineni ascribed to religious figures. In the story, heroes of Hindu mythology express their views on sexual violence. This is extremely helpful since religion is closely connected to culture in India. The fact that the gods do not condone sexual violence in the comic can make readers more likely to change their attitude toward rape.
Of course, many might question whether a comic book, a tool more commonly used for entertainment purposes, is the best tool to address such a sensitive issue. Comic books usually revolve around stories of strong, flying men in capes who save humanity from an evil villain. Had Priya’s story been presented in this stereotypical manner, the readers might not have been able to take it seriously. In Priya’s Shakti’s case, however, the content was presented in a respectable manner. The women are given very strong roles, and the realities of Indian society are presented in an objective way. The story is about a rape victim who became a hero by raising awareness of sexual violence. It is by no means the stereotypical superhero story.
The visual component of the comic also helped illustrate this serious issue without alienating the audience with overtly violent or traumatic images. The cartoon-like graphics illustrated the men chasing Priya, her emotions at the moment and the time of day, debunking many myths regarding how rape takes place while remaining appropriate for readers of all ages. The simplicity of the comic book also makes it possible for a broader audiences to be reached. In essence, the story is empowering, and the medium allows for the issue to become comprehensible to audiences of a wide demographic.
This is not to discount the power of the traditional superhero comic books. In Western culture, many are empowered by iconic stories of Superman, Spiderman and Ironman that started as comics. It’s heartwarming to see artists such as Devineni creatively alter a traditional storytelling medium and apply it to address serious and urgent issues such as rape.

After topping host No. 22 California (33-17, 17-10 Pac-12) 11-3 Saturday afternoon, the     No. 15 Trojans (35-18, 16-11 Pac-12) lost 7-5 and 7-2 on Sunday and Monday, respectively.
The Trojans’ win was sparked by three RBIs and a two-run home run from junior center fielder Timmy Robinson. In the top of the second, Robinson kicked off the scoring drive with an RBI double.
Sophomore first baseman Jeremy Martinez and senior second baseman Dante Flores also had great offensive showings. Martinez went three-for-five with three RBIs and Flores knocked in two RBIs.
Senior pitcher Kyle Davis —in his second-straight Friday night start — kept the Bears to three runs and eight hits in eight innings. He struck out three and walked only one. Davis improved his record to 3-1 on the year.
Sophomore pitcher Andrew Wright tossed a 1-2-3 ninth inning with one strikeout to close out the game for USC.
Game 2 of the series didn’t fair as well for the Trojans. It was a back-and-forth battle, but the Bears maintained the lead and got the win to tie the series at one game apiece.
USC jumped ahead early with senior catcher Garrett Stubbs knocking in Martinez with a double in the first. Redshirt junior left fielder Bobby Stahel had a sac fly to give the Trojans a 2-0 lead in the second.
It was back-and-forth scoring until the Bears broke it open 5-3 in the fifth inning. It wasn’t until the seventh inning that the Trojans tied it up.
Flores had a sac fly and junior third baseman Blake Lacey knocked in his second RBI of the game.
With two on and two outs, junior right fielder AJ Ramirez was up, but he struck out to end the offensive-fueled inning.
The Bears scored the                     go-ahead run in the bottom half of the inning and knocked in an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth to seal the win and tie the series at one each.
In the final game of the series, the Trojans saw their only two scores in the first inning —despite outhitting the Bears 8-7.
In the 7-2 loss, the Trojans’ rough patch was the nine walks from the pitchers.
When the game kicked off, it looked like it was going to be a great day for the Trojans after they scored two runs on a                    two-out rally. Martinez, Robinson and Flores all contributed to the early 2-0 lead.
Flores went 2-for-4 with one RBI, and Martinez went 2-for-3 with one run on the day.
The Bears sparked off their offense with three runs in the bottom of the third and sustained that momentum throughout the game to score a total of seven unanswered runs.
Three of the Bears’ seven runs were scored by baserunners who were on because of the atypical number of walks from the Trojans pitchers. Another run came as a result of an error and another as a result of a hit by pitch.
Freshman starter Mitch Hart took the loss (7-3 on the year) in three innings. He allowed three runs (two earned) on three hits with five walks and two strikeouts.
The Trojans brought in three relievers — juniors Brent Wheatley, Marc Huberman and Brooks Kriske — to try and salvage the game, but fell short.
Wheatley threw for 1.1 innings, allowing two runs on two hits. Huberman threw two innings, allowing two runs on one hit and three walks. Kriske closed out the game in 1.2 innings, allowing only just on run with two strikeouts.
The Trojans’ lack of scoring can be attributed to the fact that they left nine runners on base.
Before dropping this series, the Trojans won three of their last four.
USC will look to shake off this past weekend and win its final series of the regular season at home this weekend.
The Trojans will close out the regular season with a home series against No. 12 Arizona State     (32-19, 17-10 Pac-12). The first game will be at 7 p.m. on May 22.

I should probably open this column by stating that I am from Houston, or Clutch City, and have been a Rockets fan my entire life. The team’s recent performance, however, is historic and deserving of praise from more than just Rocket fans.
Only eight other teams in the NBA have ever come back from a 3-1 series deficit, as the Rockets did against the Clippers. Furhermore, the Rockets held the home court advantage, but forfeited it in the Game 1 blowout loss to the Clippers. The Rockets won Game 2 at home, but lost Games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles. The Rockets won Game 5 in Houston, but the series went back to the Staples Center for a must-win Game 6.
The Clippers had a 92-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter. It seemed the Clippers had all but punched their ticket to the Western Conference Finals. James Harden, the runner up for the MVP Award, was on the bench and Dwight Howard was in foul trouble. Josh Smith checked into the game, Corey Brewer and Trevor Ariza got hot, and the Rockets came back to win,      119-107 and force a Game 7.
The Rockets’ momentum from Game 6 carried into Game 7 and Houston led the entire game. According to ESPN, in their biggest deficit in the third quarter of Game 6, there was a .1 percent chance that the Rockets would come back to win the series. Only eight teams before them had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit, making their series win not only improbable but historic.
The MVP runner up will now have to face the reigning MVP Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors, who rarely drop games at home, will have home court advantage in the Western Semifinals. The Rockets will need all of their momentum to take a game in Oakland and win the series.
The Warriors are an explosive offensive team accompanied by a top-ranked defense. James Harden will be without Patrick Beverley, who suffered a broken wrist. Brewer, Smith and Ariza will need to repeat their Game 6 performance if the Rockets have any chance of advancing to the Finals. Even if the Rockets route the Warriors, they’ll likely have to face LeBron James and the Cavaliers out of the East.
Whether or not Houston can repeat its historic performance will likely be the deciding factor in the Western semifinal series.

The top-ranked USC women’s tennis team’s national title campaign was ended by No. 4 seeded Vanderbilt 4-0 in a semifinal match that featured weather delays and four three-set matches.
The Women of Troy entered the tournament with momentum and history on their side.  The last time USC secured the tournament’s top seed was in 1985, the most recent national title win for the team.  The team was also coming off the second Pac-12 title in the past three years, and this one included an undefeated Pac-12 season.
USC’s national title run began on May 9, hosting a first-round match between Long Beach State and Virginia Tech and its own first round matchup with Youngstown State.  USC would go on to blank Youngstown as well as Virginia Tech in the second round.  With the wins, USC earned its ticket to Waco, Texas, where the higher Round of 16 and beyond would be held at Baylor’s Hurd Tennis Center.
To open play in Texas, USC swept No. 16 Texas Tech in a quick match that proved USC’s dominance.  Despite a tough doubles point, the Women of Troy persevered, powering through singles play as freshman Meredith Xepoleas beat her opponent 7-5, 6-1 to clinch not only the match, but also her 20th consecutive singles victory.
In their meeting with No. 8 and host Baylor, the Women of Troy dropped their first point of the tournament despite going on to win 4-1.  After clinching a hard earned doubles point, USC’s freshman power kicked into gear with wins from No. 57 Madison Westby and No. 79 Xepoleas 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 respectively.  The lone loss would come from the No. 1 court where No. 24 senior All-American Sabrina Santamaria would drop her match with No. 22 Ema Burgic 6-2, 7-6 (6).
The loss would not affect the team though, as the third freshman No. 78 Gabby Smith dominated her opponent putting up a score of 6-1, 6-4.
The semifinal match against  No. 4 seed Vanderbilt was USC’s next challenge, and despite the 4-0 loss, the match was much closer than the score would indicate.
To secure the doubles point, Vanderbilt’s No. 20-ranked top tandem would put a beat down on the No. 24 pair of Zoë Katz and Santamaria 8-2.  Just as No. 19 seniors Guiliana Olmos and Zoë Scandalis dropped their match to their No. 18 ranked counterparts, 8-6, lightning in the area prompted a nearly 45-minute delay.
The Commodores wasted no time once the skies were clear, and they jumped out to first set wins on four different courts.  Two of those matches resulted in two-set victories for Vanderbilt; Westby lost 6-1, 6-2, and shortly after Scandalis lost 6-2, 6-2.  The other four courts engaged in battle, however, with all four matches going the distance before No. 14 Olmos dropped her match with a final score of 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
The Women of Troy finished the season with a 25-3 record, their most wins since the national championship in 1985, an undefeated Pac-12 season and a conference championship to accompany their season-long journey to the No. 1 rank in the nation.
USC was also a big winner of ITA Southwest Regional Awards with head coach Richard Gallien winning Coach of the Year.  It was his fourth selection for the honor.  Assistant Coach West Nott also picked up a coaching award, winning his second assistant coach of the year award.
Freshman Madison Westby garnered the award for Rookie of the Year for her dominant play on both the singles and doubles side of the court.  The No. 57 singles player recently picked up a similar award for Pac-12 Freshman/Newcomer of the Year.

Both the USC women’s and men’s team’s placed second in the 2015     Pac-12 Track & Field Championships, securing 13 event titles at the meet hosted by UCLA in Westwood, California, last Sunday.
Among some of the greatest accomplishments was that of junior Andre De Grasse, who was named the Pac-12’s Men’s Athlete of the Meet after winning the 100m, 200m and being part of the winning 4x100m relay.
“I just go out there and focus, run my race,” De Grasse said. “Just focus on me, don’t worry about anybody else. I wasn’t worried about breaking any records. Just worried about lowering my time, beating myself.”
De Grasse broke the former 100m USC record by .6 seconds and the conference meet record that was currently held by UCLA’s Ato Bolden since 1996.
“It still hasn’t hit me yet,” De Grasse said. “I feel like I still ran 10.00 or 10.01. So I’m just kind of soaking it in right now.”
Freshman Deanna Hill, freshman Ky Westbrook, junior Alexis Faulknor and redshirt junior Tynia Gaither broke the meet record for the 4 x 100m relay that was set last season by USC. Their winning time of 43.10 beat last season’s record by more than 10 points and ranked them third all-time as a Pac-12 squad.
Freshman Dior Hall came back with a win in the 100m, finishing with a time of 12.99 and, along with senior Melia Cox’s third place time of 13.48 and sophomore Amelie Iuel’s seventh place time of 14.11, helped earn 18 points for USC and narrowed Oregon’s lead to 109-69.
“I knew Sasha [Wallace] was ahead of me,” Hall said. “I knew how high I needed to score in order for us to try and win Pac-12s, so I just knew that if I got her at the last hurdle and outrace her to the finish line, then hopefully, I’ll beat her.”
USC also dominated the 400m race, with senior Vanessa Jones placing first with a new personal record of 51.50, which advanced her to second place on the USC all-time list in the event and eighth of all-time by a Pac-12 runner.
“I knew it was destined for me,” Jones said. “It was just across town, all my family was here, I’ve been working hard and I knew I was going to come out with the win.”
Jones became only the second USC woman to win the Pac-12 400m title, along with Gervaise McCraw, who achieved the title in 1987 at the first Pac-12 event.
Along with freshman Kendall Ellis, who placed fifth with a score of 52.88, Akawkaw Ncha-Ndip placed sixth with a score of 53.00 and Cameron Pettigrew placed seventh at 53.28, the Trojan women earned 19 points, narrowing the score against Oregon to 133-94.
The Women of Troy also commanded the 100m dash, placing second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth in the race. Gaither led the pack with a PR of 11.27 putting her into ninth place on USC’s all-time list. Westbrook took third with a time of 11.36, displacing Faulknor on the all-time list, who placed fourth. Hill and sophomore Destiny Brown placed fifth and sixth respectively, earning 26 points for USC.
In addition to the 100m dash, the Trojan women took first and second in the 400m IH race. Junior Jaide Stepter won the event for the second consecutive time with a score of 55.85, making her the second woman ever to win the event more than once.
“I’m just so excited because we’ve been training for this, I’ve been praying for it since we started practice in September,” Stepter said. “It’s just so exciting to be able to do it and be able to repeat a Pac-12 title, it’s so amazing. And being able to have my teammate as my biggest competition is such a privilege for both of us to be able to have the pressure on each other every day at practice.”
Iuel took second place in the event, with a time of 56.06 and an earned 18 points between the two women. This cut Oregon’s lead to 163-138.
The 200m races further narrowed Oregon’s lead for the women’s team. The Trojan women had seven runners reach the final line with Gaither winning first place with a time of 22.97. Faulknor was second with a time of 23.08 and Hill close behind with a score of 23.14. Jones, Cantrell, Westbrook and Brown were 4th through 7th respectively, earning 34 points for the team.
“We had quite a few personal bests and just about everyone in our team scored points. When you face a dominant team like Oregon there is no room for mistakes and we fell shy in a few areas that cost us the championship,” USC Director of Track & Field Caryl Smith Gilbert said. “We had finals and graduation last week so now its time to rest and train for the NCAA Championships in two weeks.”
The Trojans will compete again at the 2015 NCAA West Preliminary Rounds in Austin, Texas from May  28-30.
