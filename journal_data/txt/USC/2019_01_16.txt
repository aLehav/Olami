This weekend, millions of citizens across the country are expected to attend the third annual Women’s March. The march has previously drawn record-breaking numbers in Los Angeles, a city that routinely observes similar rallies and marches for causes like immigrant justice, Black Lives Matter, Native and indigenous people’s rights and, more recently, the Los Angeles teachers’ union strike. Women’s March leadership has made efforts to combat perceptions of the march as one that is emblematic of “white feminism” and emphasize the importance of diversity and intersectionality in its messaging and social posts. 
But the fact remains: If diversity and intersectionality matter to those who have shown up to the Women’s March for the last two years, they should also show up to rallies protesting other forms of identity-based oppression. This is certainly a trend nationwide, although in a city as diverse as L.A., the disparities in terms of who shows up to what are more visible and unsettling. 
The reality is that where we choose to physically place ourselves and the events that we take time out of our days to show up for, speak volumes about our priorities and the issues and groups that matter to us.
Certainly, attendees of the Women’s March show up in good faith and for a deeply important cause. In my two years of experience at the L.A. Women’s March, I’ve proudly marched alongside a beautiful and empowering diversity of attendees,who defy monolithic, often white, cisgender and heterosexual understandings of women as a political group. 
Despite controversies involving some of the leaders and organizers of the movement, the marches themselves feel grassroots — deeply personal and intimate in nature. People  show up with their families and loved ones to stand in solidarity and send a clear message to President Donald Trump’s administration and the predominantly male leadership of this country, who routinely use their power to degrade and oppress women and other marginalized groups.
The suggestion that those who attend the Women’s March should also look into supporting other solidarity rallies in their communities is by no means a condemnation of the march nor a discouragement from attending. But one prevalent concern after the first Women’s March, which took place in 2017 in the wake of Trump’s inauguration, was that attendees would quickly become disengaged afterward. 
One way to stay engaged beyond attending the annual march is to turn to the voting polls, volunteer for local campaigns and be aware of other rallies and community solidarity events to attend. 
During election season, voting, phone-banking and canvassing for campaigns are central political acts that democracy relies on to survive. But physically being present and offering marginalized groups support and solidarity by showing that you care enough to show up is an integral political act, as well.
At USC, my attention is particularly drawn to the rousing, passionate people organizing in support of Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis, whose June termination was announced in December.  
Selective outrage is one of the most pernicious purveyors of social control and oppression. Choosing what to pay attention to — and, conversely, what to ignore — and choosing what to show up for are deeply political acts. I look forward to seeing many of you at this weekend’s Women’s March — and hope to see you at subsequent solidarity rallies in L.A., too.

The talk of a global “loneliness epidemic” is increasingly common: The U.K. now has a loneliness minister and the United States has labeled loneliness a public health concern in need of intervention. At universities like USC, students are often forced to rebuild a social life from scratch, naturally making college campuses some of the loneliest places in the world. 
The demand for mental health care services at USC is growing, and the University is responding by making institutional improvements. However, these improvements alone cannot and will not effectively shift the perspectives of students in need. It is time for USC to take a more creative and personal approach to addressing the mental health of the student body by hiring students to help counsel their peers.
Colleges across the nation are facing a mental health care crisis. The number of students seeking help at USC alone has seen a 168 percent increase over the past five years, according to the Center for Health Reporting. In turn, it is imperative for USC to evaluate whether or not students today have access to the right resources.
Statistically, students are arriving on campus more anxious, depressed and stressed out than ever before. The number of students seeking help for mental health issues has outpaced overall enrollment growth by 25 percent, according to a 2016 report by Penn State University. 
In response, USC has established initiatives to provide an institutional foundation for overcoming loneliness. The Rev. Jim Burklo, an associate dean at the Office of Religious Life, has created on-campus initiatives to address the loneliness epidemic. “Campfires,” for example, arranges weekly student-led meetups to explore how groups — fraternities, sororities and residential communites, to name a few — and individuals can cultivate healthy environments for friendship and conviviality on campus. 
USC is stepping up in other ways, too. The school’s counseling center is setting up an Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention to tackle mental health-related issues as they occur. 
There has been a progressive shift in the way universities respond to students’ mental health issues. A decade ago, professors and faculty at most schools would not look twice at a student who abruptly started failing tests or missing class. Today, faculty are trained to recognize and respond when a student is in crisis. It is reassuring that, while there is still much work to be done, at the very least, university officials are collectively playing the role of vigilant watchdog over mental health.
While these initiatives are necessary to set that foundation and to demonstrate the institution’s recognition of the problem at hand, they alone will not revolutionize student mental health care. In the information technology era, college students are confronted with a contemporary breed of loneliness that can lead to mental health issues nourished by social media. 
Today, it is easier than ever before to socially withdraw oneself. Students retreat to their phones for comfort if they feel intimidated or overwhelmed. This type of dependency can quickly develop a vicious cycle where students retreat further and further into the digital world until meaningful connections are nonexistent. For these students, the idea of attending a weekly meetup to combat loneliness would be a far stretch.
Technology and social media are especially relevant when it comes to recognizing the mental health care crises on college campuses. Though struggling individuals tend to withdraw, reaching out is their best shot at getting the help they need. While the University strives to provide adequate mental health resources, it is inefficient if students do not proactively get help. 
There is a vast gap between the overall need on campus and the school’s ability to properly help its students. To bridge the gap, USC must invest in mental health resources.  
“It really is a resource issue,” Chief Health Officer Sarah Van Orman said to The Orange County Register.  “To provide for all the mental health needs of their students, meaning long-term care… many of our campuses would need to double or triple our staff.”
That being said, USC needs to get creative with its strategies for approaching students in need. In addition to hiring more support staff, hiring students with previous experience in mental illness prevention would provide a tangible on-campus resource that other students would be more likely to take advantage of. These students could speak directly from their own experiences with campus organizations to offer a safe forum of discussion to vulnerable groups. 
These initiatives would take time and effort to execute effectively, and USC has admitted it does not have the resources to help every student. In turn, it has become necessary for USC Student Health to reach out and harness the influence of their own student body. If anyone has the potential to change the mindset of a student in need, it is other like-minded individuals who face the same challenges.

Undergraduate Student Government senators discussed plans for piloting discounted Metro passes, establishing a student workers union and providing an easier way to challenge USG funding on Tuesday. 
Sen. Michaela Murphy, who announced her presidential bid yesterday, detailed future plans,including the possibility of implementing discounted Metro passes for undergraduate students. 
Currently, the Graduate Student Government offers graduate students an unlimited number of discounted Metro passes. Murphy said she is working with GSG and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to find a way to apply this service to the undergraduate student body as well. 
“It’s been difficult because it’s a really expensive program the way it’s modeled right now,” Murphy said to the Daily Trojan. “What we’re trying to do is … see if there’s a way to have a smaller pilot program to test the success of it and whether or not it would be worth the much larger investment.” 
Since USG would fund the student Metro passes, Murphy said that if a pilot program were to occur, USG would select applicants through a general lottery system to ensure fairness. 
“If this were to come through it would probably be [middle] to end of next year, academically,” she said. 
Murphy also discussed her intention to unionize student workers in USC and launch an organization similar to the Student Workers Union in the University of California system.
“What we would really like to try and do is take one of the programs that they have at the UCs and find a way to shift the model to be appropriate for us as a private institution,” Murphy said. 
Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Crane announced his continued push for student representation in Campus Activity Goal groups.
“That’s where a lot of the conversations happen, especially the one that discusses the creation of bystander training for the school,” Crane said. 
According to Crane, only graduate students are currently represented. 
Sen. Meagan Lane updated attendees about her initiatives for the semester, including a speakers amendment, increased student lounge space and cross campus cultural conferences. Lane said USG should make a more uniform system for students to oppose potential event funding. 
“Obviously Ben Shapiro was kind of a crapshoot last semester,” she said during the meeting. “We’re trying to create some rules and guidelines for students to be able to challenge what the Undergraduate Student Government uses its money to promote.” 
Young Americans for Freedom requested funding from USG for Shapiro’s visit to campus in early October. This led to frustration among the Black Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and other student groups.

Center for the Political Future fellows and political experts gathered at Ground Zero Performance Café Tuesday for a discussion on the current political landscape and the upcoming 2020 presidential election. 
The event, “The New Political Landscape,” is part of a series of politically minded events dedicated to the shifting political dynamics of the country and the subsequent effects of last year’s midterm elections. Center co-director Robert Shrum said these events expose students to different viewpoints and start a conversation about significant and often topical issues.
This was the first event attended by the center’s Spring 2019 fellows, Mike Madrid and Symone Sanders. The fellows discussed topics ranging from identity politics to pop culture, all in the context of the recent 2018 midterm election and the upcoming 2020 primaries. 
Center co-director Mike Murphy said “big waves” that started in the 2016 elections have continued to affect the political sphere. Yet, he also argued during the discussion that while the 2016 election transformed the political landscape, politics have not changed permanently. 
“I don’t think that the rules of politics have changed because after [Trump] won, he got busy becoming very unpopular,” Murphy said. “We just had a midterm election about Trump, and [the Republican party] got the worst wipeout since the Watergate year of 1974, so I think the Trump magic experiment is still very ongoing.” 
Madrid, a Republican political consultant, argued that the new political landscape has invited country-wide polarization on issues surrounding race and class. This polarization has become more identifiable due to the increasing diversity in politics, Madrid said. Moreover, he said disparities between socioeconomic classes are more evident than ever. 
These topics encouraged Madrid to teach “Race, Class and Partisanship: America and the Great Transformation,” which delves into the importance of race and class distinctions in the modern political sphere.
“The intersection of race and class is something that has fascinated me for 20 to 25 years … and to be able to engage students on those topics, I think is really exciting,” Madrid said. “So for me, in many ways, this event … is really the whole purpose of what I came to spend the spring semester with USC students on.” 
During the event, Madrid said the current generation will be the first to leave the country to a non-white majority. Sanders also cited the changing racial makeup of America and how it’s affected the national legislature. 
“[The political landscape] is one that’s a lot more female, it’s a lot more ‘melanated,’ if you will,” Sanders said. “This is uncharted territory for some, but again, what’s happening nationally is what has been happening in communities across the country.” 
Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip decided to attend the event after hearing that Sanders would be speaking. Speaking about the new political landscape, Yip said that she admires Sanders and is interested in learning more about politics.
“Honestly, I just want to learn more about these fellows,” Yip said. “I think the center is awesome, but [it] should try to reach a larger audience with their events.” 
The featured guests also discussed the upcoming Democratic primary elections and if there could be a Republican insurgency in the primaries. 
Shrum suggested that the importance of digital fundraising and advertising in recent years means that Democratic candidates will declare their candidacies within the next month or so to get campaigns up and running. 
Chantel Douresseaux, a prospective student at the USC Gould School of Law, said while the new political landscape has not affected her personally, she has family members who work for TSA, and they continue to forfeit their salaries amid the government shutdown. 
In light of these issues, Shrum argued that the frontrunner in the 2020 primaries will not necessarily be the ideologically pure candidate, but will most likely be the candidate who looks like they can defeat President Donald Trump.
“The changed political landscape right now … is deadlock in government and Washington,” Shrum said. “We can’t even open the government at this point, in fact, they can’t even sit down and talk about it — so that’s going to play out and have a lot of consequences.”

The USC Office of Equity and Diversity hosted a public meeting Tuesday to address ongoing patterns of discrimination and harassment cases on campus. The event, titled “What We Have Learned: The Ramifications of Not Having Difficult Conversations,” was part of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Week and stressed the importance of having open conversations about the current challenges facing the University.
OED Director John Jividen led the discussion and represented the office during the event. The OED is responsible for investigating cases of protected-class discrimination and harassment in the USC community. 
Since the Los Angeles Times published its investigation on former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s allegedly misconduct-riddled career, Jividen said that the office has doubled in size. Currently, there are eight investigators and typically about 40 to 50 cases open at a time, covering a wide range of issues such as sexual harassment and discrimination. 
“People feel [the] administration isn’t responsive and hasn’t been responsive to bad misconduct and behavior in the past,” Jividen said. “The hope is that with the proper resources and the proper attention, we will move forward onto a better path after the things that have gone wrong in the past years.” 
Jividen discussed instances of inappropriate behavior, racism and sexism that have been ignored for decades at the University.
“[The goal] is to start a conversation about equity and inclusion on campus and just get people talking about these issues more, meeting people that are like-minded and want to learn more about this and engage in this important conversation,” Jividen said. 
During his presentation, Jividen discussed four examples of misconduct that have occurred on campus. These include a senior administrator hearing sexual comments from a subordinate, a manager hearing someone use a racial slur, colleagues describing a faculty member as “tyrannical and offensive” and a faculty member friending a student on social media and chatting with her.
“Who is going to have the guts to report that kind of behavior, knowing that their job is on the line or their colleague’s job is on the line or something like that?” Jividen said. “We have to feel like the institution is going to be responsive to your concerns.” 
Attendees discussed how the OED has an obligation to address incidents of discrimination and misconduct sooner and more carefully. Jividen said an incident of someone saying the N-word took six months to investigate.
“Don’t talk about it, be about it,” said Erika Crenshaw, a project specialist in the Information Technology Services department who attended the event. “[The OED should] show me that things have changed. Actions speak louder than words.” 
During the event, discussion surrounding Tyndall’s alleged misconduct dominated most of the conversation. Many female faculty and staff members present spoke out about systemic sexism instilled in American culture. Jividen continued to emphasize the importance of addressing any kinds of issues on campus.
“We’re missing one big component and that’s the difficulty to have these conversations,” he said. 
Various women at the event emphasized the need for proper new-hire training at USC, citing that power dynamics in many professional relationships among faculty members and with students can ultimately pose a problem. 
“I’m looking forward to building and contributing to the [diversity and inclusion] work here at the University and building it enough to not have to be its own week or a special thing,” Crenshaw said. “I can see the long-term vision of the [Diversity and Inclusion] week is bringing that work [to say], ‘We’ve done all of this, and how can we push it further? How can we continue to grow and expand and make it open and honest for everybody?’ Because diversity and inclusion is a whole umbrella.”

Students and employees at USC Village were asked to evacuate Building #9 after a small fire broke out in an unfinished unit near Trader Joe’s Tuesday night.
The Los Angeles Fire Department received a call at 8:31 p.m. The fire was extinguished 12 minutes later. 
Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas said the fire was caused by open construction material in a wheelbarrow. LAFD said it is investigating what caused the material to ignite.
“We don’t believe that there has been any arson or anything like that,” Thomas said. “It probably was just materials that should have been better contained.”  
Los Angeles Police Department Sergeant Rodney Peacock said firefighters had to force entry into the building because of  a padlock on the door. 
“I saw flames through the door and then I saw the firefighters chainsawing the door down,” said freshman Linda Guite, who was returning to her dorm from CAVA. “I thought it was a drill at first, but then I saw the actual flames.”
Trader Joe’s and Target were evacuated, along with the Cowlings and Ilium residential colleges.
Sophomore Greg Pizzurro, who was one of the first to spot the fire, said he reported it to a DPS officer after seeing flames through the windows of the Workshop Salon + Boutique unit, which is currently under construction.
“There was brown paper on the windows, so you couldn’t actually see into it,” Pizzurro said. “I looked through the cracks and there was clearly a fire.” 
Thomas said LAFD put out the fire immediately after arriving on the scene. 
“But, out of an abundance of caution … and the possibility that students could be impacted by smoke inhalation, they evacuated the building,” Thomas said. 
Residents were allowed to re-enter shortly after the smoke was blown out of the building. 
Following reports that students waited over 45 minutes to individually scan their fingerprints after an evacuation last week, evacuated students were readmitted to the building last night by showing their USC IDs, Cowlings and Ilium residents said.

In what will be the first collegiate tennis dual matches played outside of the United States, the USC men’s tennis team will play exhibition and regular season matches while in the Australian open in Melbourne.
The Trojans are scheduled to play the Tennis Australia National Academy team in the exhibition match. Additionally, the Trojans will play the University of South Carolina, which will be the team’s first regular season match, counting to each team’s overall win-loss record and Oracle ITA Collegiate Tennis Rankings.
Even though USC does not start conference play until Feb. 8, the Men of Troy have had their fair share of success so far. In the latest set of individual rankings, the ITA has ranked six Trojans in the top-60 in singles and one doubles team in the top-50. 
These six Trojans are seniors Laurens Verboven, Logan Smith and Tanner Smith, sophomore Daniel Cukierman,, freshman Bradley Frye and redshirt junior Jake Devine, who are ranked No. 8, No. 19, No. 32, No. 34, No. 47, and No. 56, respectively. As for doubles, Cukierman and Tanner Smith are ranked 45th in the nation.
This will be the Trojans first team match since Nov. 11, 2018, when Cukierman lost in the championship match against senior Petros Chrysochos in the Oracle ITA National Fall Championships in Paradise, Ariz. In that same tournament, Cukierman and Smith fell in the quarterfinals to senior Aziz Kijametovic and junior Francois Musitelli from Old Dominion University.
One player to keep an eye on in Australia is junior Brandon Holt. Over the holiday’s, Holt and Tanner Smith competed in the Blizzard Wild Card Challenge in Orlando, Fla., where both players had strong showings.
In a field of eight players, Holt won a string of seven consecutive sets before faltering in the semi-finals and giving up a set to freshman Sam Riffice from the University of Florida. However, Holt fought and won the match in a nail biter, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6. He made it all the way to the championship match where he lost to junior Alex Rybakov from Texas Christian University. On the other hand, after winning only one match in the first round, Smith ended up winning his consolation match against sophomore John McNally from Ohio State. 
With two dual matches already under their belt, the South Carolina Gamecocks men’s tennis team will look to extend their record to 3-0 when they take on the Trojans. Ranked No. 25 in the nation, the Gamecocks have not lost a singles or doubles match yet, going 7-0 against The Citadel last weekend.
The Gamecocks only gave up a total of eight games between both doubles and singles in that match. Their number one doubles team, consisting of freshmen Jake Beasley and Joseph Brailovsky, is a threat that hasn’t given up a game this entire season. No. 1 singles freshman Daniel Rodrigues is another player for the Trojans to keep an eye on. 
The Trojans have a tough set of matches in front of them, but look for players like Cukierman and Verboven to lead the Trojans in their first-ever overseas match. The Men of Troy are scheduled to play the Tennis Australia National Academy on Jan. 21  and the University of South Carolina on Jan. 22. The Trojans will return back home to start the ITA Kick-Off Weekend tournament next week.

The NFL regular season has come to a close and overall Trojan performances are mixed. The rookie class featured many solid prospects who displayed great potential despite rocky starts to their NFL careers. But all in all, they represented USC well with breakout performances over the course of the 2018 season. 
Sam Darnold,
New York Jets
It was a growing year for the Jets as Darnold got acquainted with NFL play in his rookie year. The Jets had a season focused on rebuilding and were less concerned about winning and more about developing Darnold and the talent around him. Darnold had one of the league’s worst receiving corps, highlighted by the low profile Robby Anderson and Chris Herndon. So far, the rest of the Jets have not given Darnold much help. 
Darnold pulled out some heroics early in the season in close losses to the Green Bay Packers and Houston Texans, throwing for around 350 and 250 yards and three and two touchdowns respectively. He also led the Jets to solid wins against the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos. While Darnold’s first season was otherwise statistically uninspiring, he showed immense passing talent and athletic ability. Unless the Jets can put more talent around him, the team may risk wasting Darnold’s quarterback talent. The Jets’ addition of Adam Gase to the coaching staff could spark a change and elevate Darnold’s play with Gase’s quarterback-focused background.
Adoree’ Jackson,
Tennessee Titans
Jackson was a bright spot on a middling Titans team that just missed the playoffs. A well-rounded athlete, Jackson knocked down 10 and intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. He returned 16 punts for 148 yards in 2018, finishing off the year as one of Pro Football Focus top 25 NFL cornerbacks. He still has a great deal of untapped athletic potential and is looking to elevate the Titans to a playoff berth.
Juju Smith-Schuster,
Pittsburgh Steelers
Smith-Schuster was a prime breakout candidate in the beginning of the season and delivered on the hype, becoming recognized as the Steelers’ 2018 MVP. One of the NFL’s top receivers, Smith-Schuster’s off-the-field charisma was matched with 111 catches for over 1,400 yards. Smith-Schuster frequently made highlight-reel plays like his 97-yard touchdown against the Broncos and was a feature on a talented Steelers team that narrowly missed the playoffs. With the drama surrounding the Steelers’ other star receiver, Antonio Brown, and his cloudy future in Pittsburgh, Smith-Schuster could be in line for even more targets next year. 
Robert Woods,
Los Angeles Rams
In his second year in Sean McVay’s high-power offense, Woods found great success as a complement to the Rams’ other elite offensive weapons. A second-round pick in 2013 to the Buffalo Bills, Woods signed with the Rams in 2016, putting up the same  mediocre numbers he had his whole career. But with another year to gel with quarterback Jared Goff, Woods erupted for just under 1,400 total yards and established himself as a staple in the Rams offense. Still in the playoffs, Woods will travel to the Superdome and face a tough Saints team. Pro Football Focus’ No. 7 receiver amounted 74 total yards in his last game in the Superdome earlier this year and is hoping to get to his first Super Bowl.
Antwaun Woods,
Dallas Cowboys
Unlike some of the other names on this list, Woods was not a high-profile draft pick and was an undrafted signee to the Titans in 2016. Woods ate his way to his nickname, the “Human Log”; when the Cowboys signed him this year, he weighed in at 6-foot-1 and 318 pounds. But after shedding weight, he went from the roster bubble to being a solid starter who contributed to a defensive turnaround that led the Cowboys to the playoffs this season.
Matt Barkley,
Buffalo Bills
When the Bills’ top 10 pick Josh Allen injured his elbow, and the Bills’ other quarterback Nathan Peterman was underperforming, they signed Matt Barkley to the roster. A Trojan legend drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley quietly floated around the league as a backup, not receiving any playing time once he left the Eagles. Signed by the Bills in Week 10, Barkley was thrust into the starting job and made the most of his opportunity. Barkley led the 2-7 Bills to a 41-10 victory against the Jets, a divisional rival, despite having no time to learn the playbook because he was just signed that week. He threw for 232 yards and two touchdowns. While that performance did not help Barkley win the starting job, he made Trojan fans proud.
Uchenna Nwosu,
Los Angeles Chargers
One of the best athletes on a rising Chargers team, Nwosu flashed a lot of talent that he hopes to translate to execution. A second round pick, the rookie only started three games and racked up 4.5 sacks including the playoffs. Even though the Chargers suffered a devastating elimination from the playoffs, Nwosu was key in their win against the Baltimore Ravens in the wild-card round with a game-clinching strip sack of Lamar Jackson. He showed potential throughout the year and will be a key player in the Chargers’ well-rounded roster as they look to win a Super Bowl in the future.
Ronald Jones,
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
He was drafted in the second round. Because of that, expectations were high for the rookie Jones in an empty backfield where he would compete for the starting job with the pedestrian Peyton Barber. Jones’ season started slowly, and he was a healthy scratch for the first few games. When finally given a chance on the field, he maintained his mediocre performance, finishing the year with 23 rushes for a disappointing 44 yards. Jones will look to harness the explosiveness that made him a second-round pick to improve his production next season.

When the NCAA baseball preseason rankings were released, USC — unsurprisingly — did not make top 25 best teams in the country. For one of the country’s winningest baseball programs in college baseball history, not making the preseason top 25 is a clear sign that the team needs significant improvement. Despite their great baseball tradition, the Trojans haven’t finished a season above .500 since 2015. The bottom line? USC baseball must work to regain its former glory.
USC primarily recruits players from within its home state, and, in many cases, it’s an ideal destination for talented players in Southern California. Because of its history as a dominant team, the program ultimately has the first choice when it comes to selecting talent out of California, and the talent pool to pick from is large — there should be no excuses for a lack of talent from in the state.
California is a hub for baseball. In many states, baseball players are limited to playing ball only in the spring and summer due to seasonal weather patterns. In sunny California, young athletes are able to practice and play baseball year-round. Thus, players get twice as much practice as their East Coast peers, which ultimately should enhance overall play. 
California also has a great baseball history and tradition, with five current MLB teams —  one out of every six baseball teams is based in California. And those teams are largely successful — the Dodgers’ and Giants’ track records over the past decade are enough proof. 
Despite not having a winning program since 2015, USC undoubtedly had the best recruiting class out of any school in California in 2018. The Trojans landed three Top 100 recruits in 2018, whereas UCLA and Stanford University each had one. If the program can continue to recruit talented players, there should be no reason why the Trojans have disappointing seasons.
This season will be critical for head coach Dan Hubbs. In his six years at USC, Hubbs has had a losing record of 163-171. He has had talented rosters over that timespan, with a number of players getting drafted to the MLB. He is also a successful recruiter, having convinced players drafted out of high school to play for the Trojans instead.
Hubbs is an intelligent coach. He speaks eloquently about the game, and the players in the dugout seem to like and respect his coaching methods. However, he doesn’t always get the most out of his star players. Take Lars Nootbaar, for example. Nootbaar was expected to be a key player for the Trojans last season, yet he didn’t reach the levels of expectation that surrounded him. Nootbaar, who was drafted in the eighth round by the St. Louis Cardinals, had a .249 batting average last season. 
USC might be considered a football school, but as that program sees its own struggles, the Trojan baseball tradition should not be overlooked. The school has won 12 national championships — twice as many as any other school. USC has produced 113 MLB players in its history, more than any other NCAA program in the country. Success should be expected when it comes to USC baseball.
After a number of disappointing seasons, the NCAA quite rightly did not include the Trojans in its preseason top 25 teams, despite the talent of the university’s recruits. The players are talented enough to change the team’s overall perception, but it’s ultimately up to them and the coaching staff to unleash USC baseball’s full potential.

A panel explored the different ways journalists cover Hollywood during awards season in professor Mary Murphy’s “Entertainment, Business and Media in Today’s Society” class Monday in Wallis Annenberg Hall. For this session, Murphy enlisted three experienced members of the Broadcast Film Critics Association: Lisa Johnson-Mandell, David Freedman and Michael Ordoña. 
The three brought a wealth of experience in show business — Ordoña and Johnson-Mandell are professional film critics, while Freedman was a producer on shows like PBS’ “Just Seen It” and Netflix’s “Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.”
Murphy hosted the panel in connection with the coverage of Sunday’s 24th Critics’ Choice Awards, which Freedman helped produce. Additionally all three panelists had voted in these awards. In fact, Freedman started off the discussion by announcing that this had been the highest-rated show in five years, bucking a recent trend of declining viewership among all televised awards shows. Freedman contested that this was the result of a variety of factors, including the inclusion of host Taye Diggs and a long-awaited acceptance speech from Lady Gaga. But as a producer, he said that his job was not to analyze the reasons for its success, but rather to ensure that the ceremony itself is successfully executed.
Freedman  left the analysis to the panel’s full-time professional critics and the three discussed the pull of certain celebrities at awards shows, particularly the power celebrities considered “hot” or “in” at the time of the show. Johnson-Mendell and Ordoña said that this year’s Critics’ Choice Awards had no shortage of these celebrities, and it’s a big reason why the show had the success it did. Freedman agreed with his sentiment and attributed several of the night’s key moments to these celebrities.
“We have to have the heat, Gaga and Bradley,” Freedman said. “And Amy Adams, who was wonderful. She and Patricia Arquette shared the Best Actress award and it was our moment of zen.” 
In discussing the Critics’ Choice Awards, the three also analyzed the phenomenon of a tie for a top award, which happened twice at Sunday’s award show. In the first instance, Adams and Arquette tied for Best Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made For Television for their respective performances in “Sharp Objects” and “Escape at Dannemora.”
For the  Best Actress award, Glenn Close and Lady Gaga tied for their performances in “The Wife” and “A Star Is Born,” respectively. Johnson-Mandell argued that this occurrence is usually a very good thing for awards shows, as it affirms that one can and should recognize multiple brilliant performances.
“Ties — you can kind of see them coming … Support was totally widespread this year for a lot of actors as well as films,” Johnson-Mandell said. “There wasn’t one clear winner that was just a monster that just kind of took everything away.” 
“When there’s a tie, you just kind of give it to the nominees. In my opinion, it makes the whole thing more fun — the more the merrier.”
Murphy then posed a question to her guests: What effect, if any, do early awards show results have on the Oscars? 
Ordoña quickly chimed in with research he found while writing a statistical piece on this very subject. He started this piece when he became annoyed with different outlets commenting that the Golden Globes’ nominations and winners foreshadowed the Academy Awards. He argued that the member pools for the two awards shows are almost completely different, and any overlap of nominees is purely coincidental.
“There is no correlation between critics’ groups and the Oscars, which only makes sense because there’s no overlap,” Ordoña said. “Virtually none of us are in the Academy. Whereas the guilds — Directors’ Guild, the Producers’ Guild — they’re very good predictors.”
As the conversation came to a close, panelists discussed covering Hollywood as commentators or critics. Freedman expressed his frustration with social media and YouTube, which he believes have devalued professional criticism.
“[Criticism] does take a special skill, but the problem is that there’s just so much noise coming from 15-year-olds living in their mom’s basement in Iowa, and [they] get more hits than someone writing for the L.A. Times,” Freedman said.
Johnson-Mandell pushed back on this notion and insisted that such teenagers are simply doing what good content creators have always done: carving out their own niche. She recounted her own job of delivering quick film recommendations over the radio.
Ordoña finished the conversation by giving Murphy’s journalism students some advice for interviewing celebrities. After years of attending countless press junkets, he remarked that he has finally found a tactic that can work for even the toughest of interviewees.
“One thing that leads to a really fruitful interview is if you find the thing, first of all, that not everybody is talking about with [them], and also find the thing that [they] are interested in,” Ordoña said. “Of course your first interest is what’s going to be interesting to your reader.”
