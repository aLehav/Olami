No USC fan wants to relive last weekend’s embarrassment in Eugene.
The Trojans were outworked, outhustled and outplayed. USC needs a small-scale game like this Saturday’s in Tempe, Ariz. to regain its skills, swagger and dominant attitude.
If the Trojans recover their form, there’s no doubt they would love a rematch with Oregon at the end of the season. Too bad it won’t happen.
Yet, after Oregon restored competition in the Pac-10 last weekend, this much has become clear: the Pac-10 needs to expand to 12 teams. This isn’t solely for USC’s sake, but for the sake of the conference in general.
From a competitive standpoint, it makes sense. Two extra teams would give the hypothetical Pac-12 the ability to split into two divisions. Teams would no longer play a nine-game conference schedule, but rather eight games — giving them the opportunity to schedule a weaker non-conference foe.
This is what Florida does when they schedule powerhouses such as Charleston Southern. In an informal poll conducted this summer by ESPN.com’s Ted Miller, Pac-10 coaches voted 6-4 against the current round-robin scheduling in favor of a new format. So the coaches are on board.
This format would also allow the Pac-12 to play a championship game. Teams that are tied at the top of the conference, or that had one or two losses, would be able to go head-to-head in a dramatic and meaningful late-season battle.
This would not only give the conference more exposure — which it desperately needs as everyone annually views the Pac-10 as an inferior BCS conference — but it would give the teams an extra shot to play for the BCS championship game.
If this were the case, USC could theoretically play Oregon again in a month’s time. If both teams win out to that game, they will likely be in the top seven and the winner will get a big resumé boost for the championship game.
In fact, a scenario like this is playing out right now in the SEC. No. 9 LSU plays No. 3 Alabama tomorrow. If LSU beats the Crimson Tide and wins the rest of its games, the Tigers will have a rematch with Florida, a team they lost to earlier this season, in the SEC Championship Game.
It will be hard turning down the winner of that game for the BCS title match.
But who would be the other two teams to include in the Pac-12?
The first two obvious choices would be Boise State and Utah. Both teams have played in BCS bowls recently and have high caliber football programs.
By joining the Pac-10, Boise State would be able to boost its profile because it no longer would be playing against Tulsa or Fresno State.
It would silence the critics who claim that the Broncos play an easy schedule and don’t belong in the BCS championship game. Plus, it would be cool to see the Trojans play on a blue field.
Utah is a solid choice too. The Utes have two BCS bowl victories under their belt, which is more than any Pac-10 team not named USC. They have good talent, recruit in California (see former No. 1 NFL Draft pick Alex Smith) and, for TV’s sake, sit in the 35th largest television market.
Unfortunately, that might be the problem. College football is all about ratings and money these days, and university presidents and athletic directors aren’t so quick to add the two teams.
It would just be two more teams with which to share revenue, and Boise and Salt Lake City aren’t exactly the television hot spots that would give the Pac-12 more exposure or money from TV deals.
Last year, USC had the same win-loss record as the two teams playing for the BCS national championship, Florida and Oklahoma, yet after its loss to Oregon State, USC was never considered a true contender for the title match. If the Trojans played Cal, Boise State and Utah to compliment Ohio State and a conference title game, there’s a good chance USC would’ve gone the route of LSU two years ago.
Remember that? In 2007, No. 5 LSU played No. 14 Tennessee in the SEC Championship game. After the victory, LSU jumped all the way up to No. 2, while idle and fellow two-loss team USC stayed below the Tigers. LSU played in and won the BCS title game.
Expanding the Pac-10 by two more teams would no doubt bring more national intrigue and prestige to the conference. If it had been the Pac-12 from the start, the one-loss USC teams in recent past that made an annual tradition out of pummeling Big Ten opponents would definitely have had a better shot at reaching the national title game and proving to the country that the Pac-10 is reputable.

Actually the league needs to contract and become the Pac 8.
The conference championship games are a joke, played in half empty stadiums during examination time  as supporters save money to travel to bowl games.
The two Arizona’s should be thrown out of the Pac. Their academic standards are dismal, they don’t fit into the geographic nature of the conference and, yes, their academic standards are dismal.
I would be far more ebarrassed with Boise St. in the Pac 10!!! You must be joking. Utah, yes, BSU, no way. Laying down with the dog that is the BCS isn’t the solution. A PLAYOFF SYSTEM is. Boise St. with Cal, Stanford, UCLA and USC, you must be joking…….at least I hope so.
So you’re saying this now that we lost to Oregon? Would you say this had we beat Oregon? Playing the same team twice negates the importance of every game. And stoop to Florida’s level of playing useless games? Playing good non-conference teams is what separates us from the SEC.
Get over it dude, we lost to a good Oregon team, and don’t deserve to be in the Rose Bowl. I know you’re not used to this losing thing (as most spoiled fans are), but writing articles figuring out a way for us to make it back is just looking for an excuse. Rather than make excuses, lets focus on the positive and get on with the season.
The only fix is a playoff (which is your only good, yet obvious point in the article). We don’t need Boise St. in the “pac-12,” but in a playoff.
Why not invite BYU and University of Colorado?
I agree with everything but the following:
“giving them the opportunity to schedule a weaker non-conference foe.”
We should never stoop down to Florida’s way of scheduling cupcake non-conference games.
 Everyone should be doing what USC does, and schedule significant non-conference games….football should be about playing the best opponents first, not figuring out how to manipulate the system in order to ensure a BCS bowl appearance.
You’ve got a point there: if nothing else, under that scenario, SC would have been able to redeem itself by potentially beating Boise State!

Pete Carroll is navigating uncharted territory.
After his team suffered the worst loss in the last 12 years of the program, the USC coach is starting from scratch. The Trojans sit third in the Pac-10 standings and are considered outsiders for the conference crown.
Still Mr. November? · Pete Carroll has never lost a game in November, but he’ll put that streak to the test on Saturday. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But despite not playing the role of favorite in the conference, the mission of closing out the year with a strong effort remains the same.
“The ability to return and deal with the finish of the season has been something that’s been pretty unique for us,” Carroll said at his weekly press conference. “We need to see if we can rediscover that again.”
Although spirits were low following the loss to Oregon, the Trojans have two streaks working in their favor heading into their next game.
USC has not lost consecutive games under Carroll since the coach’s inaugural season. And November has been especially kind to Carroll, who is 27-0 during the month since arriving at USC.
The Trojans hope that those two pieces of recent history will remain on their side this Saturday, when they travel to Tempe, Ariz. to take on Arizona State at 5 p.m. PST.
Arizona State coach Dennis Erickson said he expects the Trojans to have no hangover from last week’s Halloween disappointment.
“A lot of teams have gone up to Oregon and had that happen and things just start rolling on you and it’s tough, but that program isn’t where it’s at by not coming back and fighting like heck,” Erickson said at his weekly press conference. “They react pretty well when they get beat.”
Carroll immediately expressed his disappointment in the USC defense after the loss. He noted that most of the problems were schematic and said that he planned to throw out the gameplan that the Trojans had employed.
“What happened is we didn’t play with the same commitment and intensity that we normally do,” Carroll said. “We got caught looking and reaching and grabbing, and it was a nightmare.”
The Trojans are dealing with bruises beyond the ones to their egos. Several players will play through injuries on Saturday, while others will miss the game entirely. Senior tight end Anthony McCoy is among those not expected to play after he was unable to practice throughout the week.
Redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams, however, is expected to play, as are running backs junior Joe McKnight and redshirt junior Allen Bradford.
The news of McKnight and Bradford’s health came as a relief for USC, given the task it faces against Arizona State, which ranks No. 4 in the country in run defense. Linebackers senior Mike Nixon and freshman Vontaze Burfict have starred in a unit that already has 13 interceptions this year.
“They’ve pretty much taken the running game away from teams for the most part,” Carroll said. “And it allows their pass rush to get run at you, so we have to deal with that.”
The trip to Tempe represents the Trojans’ last road game of the year. The away games have thoroughly tested USC this year. The game against Cal was the lone road trip in which USC won by more than a touchdown.
“It’s been a difficult year on the road,” Carroll said. “I think our message is to finish this road season on a good note.”
Coming back after a devastating loss would be a tough task, Carroll said. But the USC coach thought his players would not have trouble bouncing back.
“They’re respectable, and they felt the hit,” Carroll said. “But they’re ready to turn and go ahead.”

How many ways can one story be told?
For Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, the popular moral-heavy tale centered around the “Bah, humbug” growling Ebenezer Scrooge in 19th century London, the adaptations are numerous and the possibilities endless.
Director Robert Zemeckis has led his love affair with performance-capture technology into the Christmas season with his extravagant yet surprisingly faithful 3-D take on A Christmas Carol, which opens Nov. 6 and stars Jim Carrey as Scrooge.
The latest performance-capture exploration from Zemeckis, A Christmas Carol rounds out the director’s digital 3-D animation triumvirate, which includes winter-themed film, The Polar Express, and literature-to-film adaptation, Beowulf.
As a remake of The Beatles’ Yellow Submarine in digital 3-D will follow in 2010, it’s undeniable that the filmmaker, who first garnered attention with the Back to the Future series and critical acclaim with the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump, is “falling in love with this digital cinema.”
“Ever since Polar Express, I’ve been on this quest to think of movie ideas that can be presented in this new art form,” Zemeckis said  at a recent Los Angeles press conference. “I just got hit with this idea that it could be A Christmas Carol.”
Struck with inspiration, Zemeckis reread the novella to refresh his memory of not just the story, but also Dickens’ vision.
“[Dickens’ story] hasn’t been realized in the way it was imagined by him,” he said. “So I thought this will be perfect: Take a classic story that everyone is familiar with and re-envision it in a new and exciting way.”
This new and exciting way, however, is not solely the creation of computers. As Carrey puts it, performance capture does not limit actors to voice-over work but instead generates “full performances by actors.”
“The technology is so far advanced from Beowulf, where our eyes, every movement, the minutia of our acting, you see on the screen,” added Robin Wright Penn, who plays Belle in the film. “Every movement is capture and yet, you can change the size of the eye with the animation.”
As if performing in a stage-play, the actors work within a minimally designed space — in this case, a block of infrared lighting — and run through an entire scene from beginning to end without stopping. Without having to worry about cameras, lighting or running out of film, the actors are able to spend more time on honing the blocking and action of the scene.
“As a film actor, you’re used to having a proscenium in your head somewhere,” Carrey said. “But there are no boundaries anymore.”
But this freedom is not without its creative pitfalls.
“Certain aspects of the technology make things easier to get a lot of scenes done … and to create the world [Zemeckis] wants,” Carrey said. “But for an actor, there are extra challenges. You have to create the ambiance and your surroundings in your head, and oftentimes, like when we [Carrey and Penn] did our dance, you’re clacking these pincers together with cameras on them, going ‘clack, clack’ against each other’s head. It’s really disconcerting.”
Disconcerting, maybe, but it’s a small price to pay for a stimulating performance. Zemeckis’ A Christmas Carol and passion for exploring the digital animation medium provided Carrey the daunting yet thrilling task of playing seven additional roles beside Scrooge, including the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet To Come.
“Every spirit was an aspect of Scrooge’s personality,” Carrey said. “It’s like talking to himself.”
To prepare for his role as Scrooge — perhaps his most emotionally taxing performance in the film — Carrey was not afraid of using older adaptations of Dickens’ text as research. The one that stuck out the most in Carrey’s mind was 1951’s Scrooge — a film Carrey claimed to watch every year when he was a kid — with British actor Alastair Sim as the title character.
“His whole being had an acid-reflex bitterness to it. I wanted to have that feeling,” Carrey lightheartedly said of Sim’s interpretation of Scrooge.
But for Carrey, a comedic talent who’s mostly known and lauded for his control, precision and commitment to physicality, the role of Scrooge called for a more introspective approach than Carrey’s usual in-your-face bravado.
“I based this character on the lies that we believe about ourselves,” he said. “[Scrooge] believed he wasn’t worthy of love, and so why should love exist for anybody?”
Although 3-D animation tends to be reserved for fantastical kids films, Zemeckis and his cast prove that animation can transcend beyond its assumed gimmick.
A Christmas Carol might not depict a traumatic miscarriage like in Pixar’s Up, yet the tone of life and loss is set from the film’s opening lines: “Marley was dead,” voiced over an animated corpse. There’s going to be whimsy, there’s going to be slapstick, but, most unexpectedly, there’s going to be a quiet essence of the human condition.
“The only thing we have to be aware of in this world is the unloved,” Carrey said. “Scrooge is abandoned. He tried desperately for a long time to cling to whatever’s good … but was slowly disappointed by life. He can’t build anymore unless he really goes inside himself — and the film gives him the opportunity to do so.”
[…] Robert Zemeckis spent nearly $200 million on this classic literature-to-film adaptation, which showcases subtle albeit significant advancements in performance-capture technology. […]

If a USC vs. UCLA matchup is considered big in any sport no matter the circumstances, then the No. 1 men’s water polo team’s upcoming game against their No. 4 cross-town rivals is colossal.
The Trojans enter the weekend at 19-1 and 5-0 in conference play, and remain firmly at the top of the national rankings for the fourth consecutive week. Their only loss this season came at the hands of the Bruins, who edged USC 5-4 in the semifinal game of the NorCal Tournament to snap the Trojans’ 36-game winning streak and knock them out of the No. 1 ranking.
Balancing act · Senior two-meter Shea Buckner is one of 13 Trojans with five or more goals, a balance they hope to maintain against UCLA. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Since then, USC has won 14 straight matches and is looking to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself.
“Mentally, we’re getting focused,” senior two-meter Shea Buckner said. “We’ve been ready for this last half of the season all year. We’ve worked our asses off this entire year up to this point, and we’re going to continue to work our asses off. We’re definitely optimistic and looking forward to [the rest of the season].”
Buckner, who leads the team with 30 goals, is part of a USC offense that is the epitome of balanced — the Trojans have had five or more players score in 19 of the 20 games this season, and 13 different Trojans have five or more goals total.
“I think on any given day any one of our players on our team can have four goals,” Buckner said. “[Senior driver] Justin Rappel gets shut down one day, you’ve got [sophomore driver] Peter Kurzeka who’s going to throw out four goals. If Peter gets shut down, [senior two-meter J.W. Krumpholz] is going to score four goals. If J.W. gets shut down, I might go out there and score four goals.”
While the versatility of the offense continues to be effective, the Trojans’ defense may be even more notable.
The team, motivated by a personal goal to limit their opponents to four scores or less a game, has done just that in half of the matches they’ve played this season, and have given up just 96 goals in 20 games.
Sophomore goalkeeper Joel Dennerley continues to anchor the defense, tallying 125 saves so far this year.
“Four goals a game is a goal of ours as a team, and so we definitely work hard to try and keep a team to that many,” Dennerley said. “UCLA has got a lot of firepower, so we’re going to have to deal with plenty of scouting to see what their strengths are and find ways to stop their attacks.”
Unlike the previous meeting between the two teams, Saturday’s game counts as a conference match — the first and only between USC and UCLA this season. With the season ending in less than three weeks and playoff seedings still undetermined, this weekend presents a prime opportunity for both teams to make their case for the top rank.
“We have a tremendous amount of firepower, we’re always well prepared by [coach Jovan Vavic], we know our plan and we know how to attack the defense of UCLA,” Buckner said. “We’ve just got to put it together.”

The cinematic depection of old, miserly Ebenezer Scrooge — Charles Dickens’ very own Grinch — is hardly original material.
A Christmas Carol has been adapted too many times to count. Every winter, dramatic renditions of the novella originally published in 1843 are enacted on stages worldwide. Allusions to the tale and comparisons to Scrooge are commonplace.
But in Disney’s latest film, A Christmas Carol, writer-director Robert Zemeckis revitalizes Dickens’ timeworn story into something fresh, original and startlingly macabre.
Zemeckis’ animated retelling stays faithful to Dickens’ tale. One Christmas Eve, a surly Scrooge is visited by four ghosts — the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future, as well as the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley — who open his eyes to the terrible consequences of his greed.
What Zemeckis does differently in his version is introduce a magical, transformative ingredient into the mix: digital technology.
The film is a technical feat — and visual treat — that showcases some of the most impressive animation technology and 3-D effects to date.
The characters in A Christmas Carol are astoundingly lifelike. Facial expressions are fluid and convincing, with all the twitches and tremors of real life — gone are the inexpressive, glazed-over faces of The Polar Express.
Close-ups reveal stunningly precise detail, from scraggly nose hairs to unsightly blemishes and pockmarks.
Jim Carrey’s nuance-filled actions translate seamlessly onto the film, but not so much that it blurs together all the diverse characters he plays (Scrooge at many ages, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet To Come). You know it’s Carrey under there, but sometimes you forget — precisely the desired effect.
Still, performance-capture animation is an emerging technology, and, if you look closely, you can see its subtle imperfections in the characters’ dim eyes and slightly stiff movements. Though the animation is gorgeously rendered, it’s missing something — that subtle something that gives human beings the spark of life.
But Zemeckis establishes himself as one of a few who really know how to use 3-D animation, and the film’s spectacular 3-D experience more than makes up for the deficiencies of the still-developing technology.
Snowflakes seem to fall on your shoulders. Candle flames tickle your nose. And in the many breathtaking time-traveling sequences, you feel like you’re zipping through the air with Scrooge: through the snowy trees of his past, crowded buildings of his present and grimy streets of his future.
Animation permits total creative freedom, and Zemeckis takes advantage of it here to retell Dickens’ story in eye-catching form.
Though Zemeckis’ A Christmas Carol is an animated production, the movie isn’t for kids. It’s surprisingly dark, weighty and even frightening at parts — more Nightmare Before Christmas than Polar Express.
Zemeckis could’ve easily adapted Dickens’ tale into a heartwarming children’s story, conjuring ghosts that are more Casper-cute than creepy.  But  the director went down a heavier road, choosing instead to harness all of the sinister, teeth-gritting potential of the original novella.
A Christmas Carol feels a lot more like a suspense thriller than a cheery Christmas movie. Creatures pop out at unexpected moments, and the ghosts are legitimately spooky, not cute (besides the Ghost of Christmas Past, who, befitting his role, is bright and playful).
The personifications of Ignorance and Want, shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Present, are terrifying, emaciated creatures straight out of Gollum’s cave in Lord of the Rings.
The film’s scenes of the future are especially horrifying. The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is a grim reaper in the form of an ominous black shadow with long, bony fingers.
At the end, there’s a chilling graveyard scene worthy of a first-rate horror film.
Of course, the film ends on a jolly note, as it’s supposed to. But its final moments of happiness and goodwill aren’t enough to give A Christmas Carol a cheery mood. The movie’s message of good cheer is almost weighed down by its frightening glimpses of how greed and selfishness can destroy a person — bah, humbug indeed.
To an audience accustomed to lighthearted animated movies with comic personalities and innocent themes, the darkness of A Christmas Carol might be disorienting.
But in this film, as in Beowulf, Zemeckis shows that animated movies don’t have to be for children and can be just as real or scary as live-action films.
Take this as a warning from Jacob Marley: Prepare to be spooked.

The No. 17 USC women’s volleyball team looks to rebound from a tough road trip last weekend as it hosts cross-town rival No. 7 UCLA at 7 p.m. tonight at the Galen Center.
While USC (15-8, 4-7) has struggled on the road, it has proved to be very strong at home, only dropping one match in conference play to Stanford on Oct. 3. USC coach Mick Haley expects the team to play well on its home court against a very talented Bruins squad.
It all connects · The Women of Troy will be counting on libero Alli Hillgren to control the passing game to set up USC’s blocking scheme. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
“Everybody’s focused,“ Haley said. “We’ve really been practicing well. I expect us to give our best effort.”
The Women of Troy traveled across town to Pauley Pavilion earlier this season, and UCLA (18-6, 8-3) swept USC in three straight sets to post a Bruin victory.
Since then, UCLA has been on an impressive run in an extremely tough conference, only dropping one match and currently riding a five-match winning streak. Last weekend, UCLA traveled to No. 14 Cal and No. 4 Stanford and beat them both.
The Bruins have compiled a 13.82 kills per set average, hitting .228 on the season. They lead the Pac-10 in digs (16.33 dps) and are second in blocks (2.80 bps).
Providing the biggest challenge for USC is UCLA’s woman in the middle: sophomore blocker Amanda Gil. She leads the nation in blocks (132 blocks for a 1.61 bps average) and serves as an intimidating presence on the other side of the net.
“They’re pretty big and they play good defense,” Haley said. “They’re pretty formidable at the net, and they scrap.”
Although UCLA has been successful recently, Haley believes his team has a solid chance to defeat its rival.
“We didn’t play well at UCLA,” he said. “It gives me hope that when we step out on the floor here [at the Galen Center], we can step it up.”
In order for the Women of Troy to post a win, they will need a solid team effort. Haley said he needs key plays from his outside hitters if his team will come out on top.
He said he needs senior Jessica Gysin to have a great game from the start and sophomore Alex Jupiter and junior Kimmee Roleder to be clicking on all cylinders.
Haley also wants to see how well junior blocker Audrey Eichler will play against the Bruins. In the first matchup between the rivals, Eichler was on the bench behind junior blocker Zoe Garrett but has since jumped Garrett for the starting spot.
“She’s been playing pretty well and scoring points for us,” Haley said. “If she keeps doing that, that will make a difference.”
Haley is also relying on senior libero Alli Hillgren to have a big match. If the Women of Troy execute a solid passing game, it will allow the team to put together a good blocking scheme against UCLA’s attack.
Although Haley would like to get revenge against UCLA by sweeping the Bruins at the Galen Center, he said he’ll take any win he can get in a tough conference, whether it’s in three, four or five sets.
“We keep battling, training hard and focusing,” he said. “We enjoy playing hard, so I’m thinking that this has got to be pretty close to the time for us to get a spurt here and get back in the win column.”
USC leads the all-time series against UCLA by a 49-44 margin but has lost five of the last seven meetings.

What can you say about a movie in 200 words?
At the Daily Trojan, the word count for film reviews stands at somewhere around 800. At other papers, that number runs higher or lower depending on the editor and, more frequently these days, the bean counters behind the arts section.
Put all those words together, and it turns out that almost any movie in wide or even limited release has tens of thousands of words written about it by the day of its release.
Lost in that torrent of words are the few locally released independent films that are unable to garner more than a mere 200 words to their name.
LA Weekly, where I intern, possesses probably the most comprehensive film coverage in the city. The editor takes special care that each film, even one opening only for a week on a single screen, receives at least 200 words through a “capsule” review.
These are films that have fought and struggled for a theatrical release — many for years — before ending up in a brief residency at one of the smaller theaters around town. They are movies whose names will never even touch the frontal lobes of most Los Angeles filmgoers.
Tragically, the reason why many of them have trouble finding release seems to be because they are terrible. I don’t mean terrible in the way the average mid-to-high budget Hollywood film is terrible. I am specifically talking about the kind of inept awfulness reserved only for truly independent films, those made by people lacking the experience and money to turn out the kind of product Hollywood has spoiled us to expect.
The worst part is that these films — each and every one of them — are deeply personal for the filmmakers behind them. The Poker House is a film about actress Lori Petty’s abusive childhood. Jordon Saffron: Taste This! — a limp satire of reality TV chefs and Hollywood celebrity culture in general — is clearly the result of the irrepressible spirit of a young filmmaker with a still-unsure hand.
Writing about major films often puts me at a distance from my subject; the amount of money and effort poured into marketing the average Hollywood film makes my 800 words seem almost insignificant. Those 200-word capsules are just about the only time, in my brief experience as a film critic, when the job becomes personal.
While writing up the review for Jordon Saffron, I received an email from the director, Sergio Myers, thanking me for taking the time to review his film. Can you imagine getting such an email from Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood?
Critics have been called gatekeepers to culture, but that’s not exactly accurate. The public is the real controller, with word-of-mouth being the X-factor behind the success of most films. But these capsules, often the only thing written about such seemingly insignificant films, can truly be called the doorway to a film’s success. After all, if nobody knows about the film and it is only opening for a single week, those 200 words become the essential way to learn about it.
Quite recently, Laemmle — a theater chain whose independent programming is brave to the point of self-harming — shuttered the Grande 4-plex, a dumpy little movie house in the basement of an office building Downtown.
Pundits were quick to point to the blindingly bright new Regal multiplex at LA Live as one of the reasons for the death of the Grande. None of Laemmle’s theaters — excepting maybe the Monica 4-plex — are particularly elegant movie-watching facilities, yet their programming is unique and refreshing. I have a soft spot for theaters like the Grande — I spent countless hours selling tickets at a dumpy 4-plex in San Diego that specialized in smaller films — and the loss of that dilapidated anti-palace served as a grim reminder of just how few screens remain devoted to independent films.
These 900 words are an exorcism of my guilt over closing the gate on three bad independent films that I’ve reviewed. Really, 200 words are hardly fair to any film — good or bad, big or small. Los Angeles is one of the two great American capitals of film, and the number of independent films that find release here rivals the famously indie-minded New York. There are real gems buried at the Sunset 5, the Monica 4-plex and the Downtown Independent — you just need to pay attention.
Anyone who calls himself a connoisseur of film owes it to himself to scan the Weekly, the DT and perhaps most importantly laemmle.com, perhaps just as a reminder that Los Angeles film does not begin with A Christmas Carol and end with The Box.

“The name’s Bond, James Bond.”
Everyone knows those iconic words of the martini-slugging, woman-chasing 007, but if not for Albert R. “Cubby” Broccoli, Ian Fleming’s super-spy might not have uttered them on the silver screen.
Broccoli was the longtime producer of the James Bond films, and one of the key reasons the franchise flourished. A man who initially struggled to find a career, Broccoli became involved in film production, and, in the late 1950s, took an interest in adapting Fleming’s James Bond novels into films. Partnering with Harry Saltzman, who owned the rights, Broccoli oversaw the production of all the Bond films until his death in 1996.
In celebration of what would be his 100th birthday, the USC School of Cinematic Arts is presenting “James Bond: Behind the Scenes with the World’s Favorite Secret Agent,” a three-day festival running from Nov. 6 through Nov. 8, celebrating Bond, Broccoli and the lasting legacy of each of them. Hosted by film professor Rick Jewell, the festival features a movie marathon, an exhibit of Bond props and two panels.
“I read somewhere that at least half the people on this planet have seen at least one Bond film, so the pictures have certainly affected people’s lives,” Jewell said. “I became [a Bond fan] when I saw Goldfinger in 1964; it’s still my favorite Bond film … I am teaching this semester, for the third time, a class on the James Bond films.”
Moderated by Jewell, the panels on Nov. 7 and 8 will examine both Bond and Broccoli in their current context. The first, “James Bond Today,” features Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, the screenwriters behind the last four Bond films, and Marc Forster, the director of the latest film, Quantum of Solace.
“I want to explore the new directions the series has taken since Daniel Craig became 007,” Jewell said. “I believe the last two films are fascinating when placed in the context of the 20 Bond pictures that preceded them, and who better to talk about that subject than the two producers plus the two writers of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and the director of the latter picture.”
The second panel, “Cubby Broccoli, Producer,” looks back on the longtime producer and his work. Panelists include Broccoli’s family members and current Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, as well as screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz (Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun) and actors Richard Kiel (the steel-crushing Jaws) and Maud Adams (the title character of Octopussy).
“All of the panelists knew and worked with Cubby and will talk about his approach to producing and the special qualities that made him one of the greatest producers in motion picture history,” Jewell said.
The film festival, located at the Norris Cinema Theatre, features nine films, showcasing all six actors that have played Bond. The festival starts off with the first film of the series, Dr. No — Sean Connery’s Bond debut.
The screenings also include George Lazenby’s brilliant, if underrated, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Sir Roger Moore’s iconic The Spy Who Loved Me and Pierce Brosnan’s franchise-revitalizing GoldenEye.
Capping off the event on Sunday night is a screening of Daniel Craig’s modern classic Casino Royale.
Alongside the film festival, there  will be an exhibit of Bond props and memorabilia in the George Lucas Building on campus. Though the film festival only runs through Nov. 8, the exhibit continues through February.
“Like many James Bond fans, we had a list of ‘iconic’ props and photos that resonated with us,” said Sandra Garcia-Myers, curator of the exhibit. “We couldn’t get the larger pieces like the rocket pack and the Aston Martin but EON Productions, the producer of the James Bond films, worked with us to provide the most bang for our Visions and Voices budget.”
Although without the Aston Martin, the exhibit still features many classic Bond props.
“Among the iconic Bond items in the exhibit are Oddjob’s steel rimmed killing hat from Goldfinger, Rosa Kreb’s knife-toed shoes from From Russia with Love, and Daniel Craig’s blood soaked tux from Casino Royale,” Garcia-Myers said.
For a film franchise that is 47 years old, and a character that has existed since 1953, James Bond has constantly evolved and adapted to the times, constantly staying relevant.
“James Bond has certainly been a reflection of it’s times,” Garcia-Myers said. “The character is, at once, a reflection of old fashioned British colonialism and chauvinism, 1960’s sexual liberation and a certain end of the century nihilism.”
Jewell sees Bond’s character as constantly modern and engaging.
“Bond is a magical creature who lives in the moment and yet never really changes,” Jewell said. “He is always tough, smart, youthful, witty, professional, sexy, but also able to mobilize the most cutting-edge gadgets, adjust to the most daunting social and geopolitical changes.”
When it comes to the enduring legacy of the franchise, Jewell only sees more possibilities ahead.
“I suppose eventually James Bond will run out of gas and they will stop making films about his adventures. But I don’t think this will happen any time soon. This is already the longest-running, most financially successful series in motion picture history,” he said.

USC junior Maria Sanchez powered her way through the first round on Thursday of this year’s ITA National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships hosted by Yale University.
Sanchez ousted Laura Vallverdu from the University of Miami 6-2, 6-3 Thursday morning.
Sanchez, ranked No. 17 in the ITA preseason singles rankings, claimed the singles crown at the ITA West Regionals in San Diego last week for the second year in a row. This secured her a place in this weekend’s national tournament with competition against the top 36 singles players in the nation.
“I just want to keep working on my individual goals and have fun. Hopefully the results will come,” Sanchez said.
Sanchez’s win in the opening round propelled her into Friday’s round of 16. She will play against Anastasia Petukhoua of Fresno State Friday at 7:30 a.m. In a close match on Thursday, Petukhoua knocked off the tournament’s No. 1 seed 6-4, 7-5.
Sanchez played in this same tournament last year, but lost in the quarterfinal round.
If Sanchez beats Petukhoua today, she will compete in the quarterfinals later today at 2:30 p.m. The semifinals will take place on Saturday, followed by the finals on Sunday.
This weekend’s indoor tournament, one of three national championship events on the college tennis calendar, features a 32-player singles draw.
With Sanchez in New Haven, Conn., six other players will compete in singles and doubles play at the Duals in the Desert tournament in Palm Springs, Calif. this weekend. (Freshman Danielle Lao is out due to injury and sophomore Elizabeth Marsico and junior Jennifer Goldman will not be attending.)
Representing the doubles teams will be junior Lyndsay Kinstler and freshman Valeria Pulido, sophomore Alison Ramos and senior Sarah Fansler, and juniors Cristala Andrews and Leyla Entekhabi.
The Duals in the Desert features competition from UCLA, USC, Northwestern and Georgia Tech.

Tuesday was the paper anniversary of the election that purportedly brought the US youth back to the polls and revived a long-stagnant interest in American politics.
Apparently, the honeymoon is over.
Young voters flocked to the polls in droves last November, giving the election the highest youth turnout since 1972, the first year 18-year-olds were eligible to fill out a ballot.
According to an exit poll conducted by CIRCLE, a non-partisan Tufts University research center, between 49.3 and 54.5 percent of eligible voters in the 18- to 29-year-old age range visited the booths. Of those in that bracket, 66 percent voted for President Barack Obama.
A year later, as the polls closed on several gubernatorial races scattered along the East Coast, the numbers were far less robust.
In Virginia, for example, only 39.8 percent of all registered voters cast a ballot; the number of voters under 30 decreased by 50 percent from the 2008 presidential election, according to Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
In New York, as the state was out prematurely celebrating a World Series, incumbent Mike Bloomberg eked out a win over city controller Bill Thompson, with a .6 percent lead, though pre-Super Tuesday polls favored the mayor by 70 percent. Surveys show that New Jersey Democrats had similar problems turning up at the booths.
USC has had similar problems rallying its once vocal participants; only a few dozen students voted on-campus for the Los Angeles mayoral elections last Spring, despite a heady election fever in November.
The 2008 elections elicited a huge youth turnout, something most pundits credit with Obama’s campaign. But the evident lag in recent youth activism is disappointing.
It’s time for the youth of America to reclaim the “Yes We Can” enthusiasm of aught-eight — or “Country First,” for those who swing that way. Though state races may not generate as many acoustic guitar Youtube endorsements, they nonetheless play an integral role.
It’s time for a second honeymoon.

Replacing a president of Steven B. Sample’s caliber won’t be easy. His leadership and poise have launched this university to unprecedented heights.
Though Sample has accomplished much, his work is anything but finished. In the hectic interim, it is critical that USC selects the right candidate to carry on Sample’s legacy.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
The search seems daunting, but if USC’s trustees are looking to continue down the road Sample paved, then they won’t have to look any farther than their own backyard. Vice President and Provost C.L. Max Nikias, a front-runner in the selection, is the most suitable candidate.
Though universities often conduct outside hires in the education realm, it makes no sense to risk going with someone new when the university knows exactly what it will get from Nikias.
USC is well aware of the unique combination of abilities and experience Nikias brings to the table. It’s why he was hired from a pool of more than 160 candidates as the USC’s next provost.
The hire has certainly paid dividends. Nikias has been the center of USC’s recent academic surge as well as the acquisition of University Hospital and Norris Cancer Center. Under his tenure, he has launched the ever-popular Visions and Voices initiative that showcases a dedication to the arts and humanities.
He’s also responsible for the foundation of the Stevens Institute of Innovation, which gives students the means to turn business ideas into reality.
Much has been made of these latest advancements and the university’s achievements as a whole, but make no mistake, USC is facing some sizable challenges.
The university’s endowment has plummeted 33 percent, in a time when student financial need is expected to increase. USC needs to fund these students without letting its cost-cutting affect classroom sizes, as it has with the University of California system.
Nor can the university phase out smaller majors as it did when USC’s German major was discontinued a year back. Doing this hinders our academic reputation and overall progress.
For USC to meet these challenges, it will need a proven leader who can also secure the fundraising the university needs to sustain its momentum. Nikias’ prior role as dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering proved he could establish a highly ranked academic program by bringing major research institutes to USC while securing $250 million in gifts and endowment, comprising largely of Andrew and Erna Viterbi’s $52 million school naming.
But more importantly, Nikias’ resume proves he can foster the overall growth of the university rather than USC’s more select programs in film or communication.
As current holder of the Malcolm R. Currie Chair in Technology and the Humanities, Nikias exemplifies how fields as diverse as science and art are critical to one another. He serves as a member of the National Academy of Engineering yet teaches freshmen ancient Athenian democracy and drama.
That’s not to say promoting Nikias doesn’t come with its own share of risks — specifically, the way that Nikias would handle the university’s delicate relationship with the local community.
As USC continues to expand into the neighborhood, its relationship with the community dwindles as families have to move farther from the campus to find affordable housing. With the Master Plan coming into effect, this problem will only persist. The success of USC’s future president will rely in part on how he or she handles this situation. How Nikias would handle this is unknown.
There may very be an outside candidate who could foster relations with the community better than Nikias could, and there are many outside candidates who are more than qualified for the job. Bringing in a fresh face could breathe new life into the campus, by introducing a new direction in how to take the university forward.
The fact remains: USC has already benefited greatly from Nikias’ presence. Thanks to his effort, the school’s academic ranking has never been higher. Despite some setbacks largely due to economic forces outside of the university’s control, there are no signs that Nikias would stall the growth it has enjoyed under Sample.
But if USC still needs Sample’s leadership, our university would be wise to promote the man who can pick up right where Sample left off.

Believe me, your anonymity is no less transparent than mine. Moreover, my guess is that you are either a member of Provost Nikias’ staff or so-related in another fashion. Check the facts: The vast majority of accomplishments by the University (particularly improvement in the status of the undergraduate schools and departments) were achieved while Dr. Armstrong was Provost. Moreover, alliteration and/or “poetic license” notwithstanding, Dr. Nikias is simply unqualified to lead USC as President. It would seem to any reasonable person/alumnus that at this point our University can expect and attract a far more prestigious cadre of presidential candidates.
As a fan of the leadership abilities of both Professor Sample and Professor Nikias, and as someone who sees great similarities in their style and worldview, I’m puzzled that Zooey would dismiss one of them as a “paranoid plutocrat.” Neither term applies, and to my knowledge Nikias is not wealthy. Perhaps your attempt at alliteration took you in an unfortunate direction? I believe anonymous Internet slams, driven by Lord knows what agendas or resentments, are an overly convenient way to mar reputations. It’s sad.
Mr. Fragosa is 180 degrees wrong in regard to Provost Nikias. As a 3rd generation Trojan alum, I can attest that the author, aside from Dr. Sample, of USC’s growth in stature and importance over the past decade and a half was Dr. Lloyd Armstrong. It is little known that Dr. Nikias attempted to have all the deans of all the schools (professional, undergraduate and graduate) fired just prior to his official appointment as Provost. Moreover, the flight of top level scholars since his appointment has been transparent and profound. Dr. Nikias is “Nixonian” in his management style and absent any real record of achievement either as a scholar or administrator. If Mr. Fragosa had even a smattering of knowledge and experience with the history of the University; he would not even consider supporting a paranoid plutocrat like Nikias to replace so eclectic and unique a renaissance person as Dr. Sample.
Why not throw that erudite condescending arrogant butt head who runs Annenberg into the mix he has everyone beliveing he is some avant gard consumate thinker!  When in actuality he is nothing more than a bow tie wearing  psyudeo intllectual in my estimation.  “Did I mention he was on Obama’s tansition team” Oh just speak with him he will tell you within the first thirty seconds while conversing with him about it..  He has gotten away with doing nothing for a while now and getting paid for it imn my opininion.Hey what they heck  why not make him the titulary President I am sure he is sitting at home thinking he deserve it. How funny!

If the USC women’s soccer team was hoping for an easy game after a hard-fought 2-1 loss at No. 3 UCLA, it’s playing in the wrong league.
The Pac-10 has five teams ranked in the top 25, and this weekend the No. 19 Women of Troy (12-6-0, 4-3-0) finish off the regular season as they head to Washington to face the No. 13 Cougars of Washington State today and Washington Sunday.
USC hasn’t won in Pullman since 2000 and hasn’t beaten the Cougars (13-4-1, 5-1-1) since a 2-0 victory in 2005 in Los Angeles. It won’t be easy this year, as Washington State is solid at home, posting a 4-1 record this season with its only loss coming from No. 1 Stanford.
“Going up to Pullman isn’t the easiest place in the world to get to,” coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “They are a really good side and are very organized defensively. It’ll be a really tough game for us.”
The Cougars have a formidable goalkeeper anchoring that organized defense in 5-foot-11 Meghan Berlingo. Berlingo has allowed just 12 goals in 17 appearances this season and has anchored a Cougar defense that has allowed only four goals at home.
The Women of Troy will need to capitalize on their opportunities because they might not get many of them. Last week against UCLA, USC had one goal on seven shots and they will need similar efficiency against the Cougars if they want to get past Berlingo.
“We need to get into a rhythm and connect passes early,” senior defender Meagan Holmes said. “There will be gaps opening in their formation and we need to capitalize on the chances that we get, be it two or 10.”
In a re-occurring theme, the Women of Troy came out timid in a lackluster first-half performance last Friday and trailed UCLA at halftime.
USC showed more urgency in the second half, controlled the tempo during parts of the half and tied the game. But the Women of Troy know they need to play the full 90 minutes if they want to win the game.
“We just need to show some consistency. When we play well, we play really well,” Khosroshahin said. “I think in the second half, there were spurts where we controlled the game. We are capable of controlling the game, we just need to be consistent about it.”
After the Women of Troy face the Cougars, they will have to head across the state to face the Huskies (11-4-3, 3-2-2), who are no slouches either, holding a 7-2-1 record at home.
Both of these games matter for seeding in the NCAA tournament.
“We’ve lost a few games we shouldn’t have,” Holmes said. “If we are set up the way we want to be set up for the tournament, we need to win these two games.”

Zimride, a social networking site designed to link carpoolers, enjoyed its most successful launch ever last week as the USC program opened, enrolling more than 1,500 students in a 72-hour period.
The company, named after co-founder John Zimmer, started up after winning an fbFund — a grant Facebook offers to application developers. Zimride already boasts a membership of more than 300,000 people in the United States and Canada, and has found early success at USC, which Zimmer claims is because of its integration with Facebook and partnership with USC Transportation.
Hitch a ride · USC employees Pete Marzocchetti (right) and Joe Nichols, who share a ride to and from their campus, used Zimride, a new carpool community, to meet each other. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan 
Jeff Shields, associate director of USC Transportation, said the university decided to work with the company because it thought it would offer students an alternative way to travel.
“We were approached by Zimride several months ago, and after some considerable research, we felt their services would be a great benefit to the campus community,” Shields said.
Students can log on to zimride.com/usc using their USC email address, type in their starting and ending locations, and are then matched to other users who either need a ride or are offering one.
The process is free for users, although Zimride charges a subscription fee for the companies and universities it works with.
The program, which began at Cornell University, has now spread to universities across the country, including UC Santa Barbara, Stanford and UCLA.
“Institutions have generally been very receptive to the idea,” Zimmer said. “The word is really getting out.”
Zimmer hopes online ride-sharing will grow in popularity since it offers people an affordable and reliable method of transportation. Much of its current success is because of its Facebook application, helping students
bypass the website’s registration and connect directly to carpools via Zimride on Facebook.
“There is so much 	upside with the service,” Shields said “Providing our customers with as many viable and affordable transportation options is truly our end goal.”
Despite its initial success on campus, many students said they had not heard of it and some are still hesitant.
“My reservations would be about the close interactions with strangers,” said Alison McDonald, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “For it to be successful, it would have to take some cues from Zipcar and have clearly defined rules so that people would know what to expect, and any and all risks involved.”
Both Zimmer and Shields maintain, however, that the
ride-sharing program is completely safe.
“Users must have an active USC email address, and the Facebook application can also be used to help users build rapport prior to sharing a ride,” Shields said.
The Facebook application
allows users to get to know each other before having to share a ride, and Zimmer encourages users to look at the profiles of those offering one. If the person doesn’t have any friends or doesn’t have a picture posted up, it’s probably best to steer clear of them, he said.
“That’s how [Zimride] is different from Craigslist. On Craigslist, you don’t know who the other person is,” Zimmer said.
Despite those apprehensions, most students think the
ride-sharing program is a good idea.
“It would be cost-efficient,” said Kaushik Bangalore, a sophomore majoring in astronautical engineering. “It’s fine because I would get to meet the person before I take the ride.”
McDonald added that the program would also be a better alternative than the options students had before.
“I’ve attempted to use the city’s public transit on numerous occasions, and have had some pretty wretched experiences,” she said.

Students, staff and community members lined up outside the Lyon Center Tuesday and Wednesday to receive free H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, though there was confusion over the availability of the vaccines.
USC was one of several makeshift vaccination clinics run by the Los Angeles County Health Department situated around the County. Though some students and faculty members visited the clinic to receive a flu shot, most visitors were members of the surrounding community, according to Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, director of the University Park Health Center.
“I think it’s a good thing for the campus, I think it’s a good thing for the community and I think it’s a good thing for the relationship between the campus and the community,” Neinstein said.
Because the vaccine supply was limited, vaccines were only administered to individuals who fell into set priority groups. Neinstein said most students fall into at least one of the groups, which include pregnant women, people living with or caring for infants under 6 months old, emergency medical services personnel and healthcare workers, children and young adults ages 6 months to 24 years old, and people 25 to 64 years old with chronic medical conditions such as heart or lung disease, asthma, diabetes or weakened immune systems.
Even with these limitations, the injectable seasonal flu vaccines — inactivated vaccines given with needles — were gone by 11:30 a.m. Tuesday and the center ran out of injectable seasonal flu vaccines again Wednesday.
“We knew there was going to be a limited supply and there is actually a limited supply all over the county,” said Tammie Akiyoshi, nursing director at USC.
The shortage prevented some individuals — pregnant women and those with chronic health issues — from being able to receive the seasonal flu vaccination. Healthy individuals could still get the seasonal flu nasal spray — a live virus sprayed into the nostril — but many did not because of fear of the nasal spray’s side effects or confusion about the situation.
Many visitors to the clinic were confused because some UPHC workers directing people at the door on Tuesday said all seasonal flu vaccinations would be unavailable until Wednesday.
“People are not used to [the nasal spray], they’re used to the injection and they fear the word ‘live’ because they are somehow concerned they’re going to get the flu,” Neinstein said. “There have been no serious side effects, and the nasal vaccine is very good for those between the ages of two and 50 who have no chronic illness.”
Despite the confusion about the seasonal vaccine, students who lined up for seasonal or H1N1 vaccines toward the end of the day Tuesday said that their waits were short, and the process was simple.
“I waited five minutes, It took me as long as it took to fill out the form,” said Robert Atchinson, a junior majoring in theatre (acting). “A lady said I looked lost, she asked me if I was under 24 and then told me to get in line.”
Some students said they were glad for the opportunity to get vaccinated for free.
“For the past month or so I’ve been checking the health center to see when they got [the vaccines] in,” said Kristin Jung, a junior majoring in human performance. “They seem to always run out.”
Although Neinstein said he was happy to see a large community turnout at the clinic, he said he wished there had been a greater turnout of students getting the H1N1 vaccine.
Neinstein said young adults are among those at highest risk have often experienced the most significant health issues in connection with the H1N1 virus, including hospitalization and death.
“If you look at some studies, only 40 percent of young adults intend to get the vaccine, so those highest risk are least interested in getting the vaccine,” Neinstein said. “Students should be getting the vaccine whenever and wherever they can.”
Neinstein said while UPHC has vaccinated about 600 students so far, they currently only have enough supplies to cover about 10 percent of all eligible students.
“We are hoping that more vaccine will be coming in the next two to six weeks,” Neinstein said.
Akiyoshi said students who missed the free vaccinations should check the UPHC as often as possible for $10 H1N1 vaccines and $25 seasonal flu vaccines.
I think there should be a big campaign that will inform everyone about the side affects of the H1N1 vaccine. Many people do not know the side affects and they are afraid of getting the vaccine. This campaign should also encourage everyone to take the vaccine. The health department should have more vaccines because everyone should take it. It shouldn’t be limited to a certain number of people.
Eventhough their was a big turn out of people taking the vaccine, I think there are even more people afraid of taking it. I don’t think anyone is quite clear on the side effects of the vaccine and this causes some sense of fear among a lot of people. It’s quite sad that the demand for the vaccines is so much, and the amount that can actually be given out is so little. Right now I think the kids should be the biggest priority since they are the ones more vulnerable to the virus and have the weakest immune systems. I think more should be done to raise awarness of the side effects and the benefits of getting the vaccine.

The newly formed USC chapter of FACE AIDS, a group dedicated to HIV/AIDS advocacy, kicked off its awareness campaign Wednesday with speaker Kay Warren, a well known HIV/AIDS activist.
At the event, which was co-sponsored by the Office of Religious Life, Warren discussed her experience establishing an HIV/AIDS initiative.
Advocate · Activist Kay Warren spoke to a group of 50 students in Seeley G. Mudd Wednesday night about her fight against AIDS and HIV. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Warren explained to the audience how she chose to work with AIDS after reading an article in a local newspaper and viewing “horrific” pictures of people infected with AIDS, including orphans who had lost their parents to the disease.
“I realized I had come to that proverbial fork in the road,” Warren told the audience. “I could go about my comfortable life, or I could become engaged in the HIV/AIDS pandemic.”
After realizing she wanted to take action, Warren traveled to other countries to volunteer and help those suffering with AIDS.
On Wednesday, Warren talked about her experiences in Mozambique. Warren emphasized in her speech that regardless of the stigma of AIDS, people with AIDS should not feel alone in the world.
“Stigma is dehumanizing and makes them feel like they are dirt or trash and that is the number one reason I’m an advocate,” Warren said.
Warren told audience members how they can advocate for those who are HIV-positive or who are living with AIDS in the local area or within the surrounding community. Warren suggested volunteering, teaching about abstinence and safe sex, advocating healthy behavior, encouraging testing or even just encouraging those to take their antiviral medication daily, because that can make a huge difference when fighting the disease.
“You must chose to put on your shoulders pain that is not your own,” Warren said.
Maran Yilpet, a freshman majoring in public policy, management and planning who grew up in Nigeria, said after the event that she feels she has a responsibility to educate people about AIDS and hopes to join FACE AIDS.
“I’m really excited about what will happen at USC because I want Americans to understand HIV in a global context because I don’t think they realize how big of a thing it is,” Yilpet said. “I realize even at USC people need to be educated about this.”
Many students in the audience of about 50 were moved by the presentation; many were holding back tears.
“[The event] made me want to cry,” said Natanya Dauster, an undecided freshman who said she may join FACE AIDS. “It was really gorgeous.”
That reaction was precisely what Fischetti and other members of the group were hoping for, as they look to expand and bring in more members.
“Our goal was to have a prominent speaker come to give a face and force to AIDS on campus and we hope to make a name of our own through this platform,” said Chanel Fischetti, the president of USC FACE AIDS and a senior majoring in neuroscience and sociology. “We want to build membership, make a force for the group and show how serious we are in what we believe.”
Fischetti said having Warren — a high-profile member of the AIDS advocacy community — speak made the group feel it is slowly creating awareness.
“It’s a huge deal we are a small group, we have been working on this since last semester,” Fischetti said. “It’s cool to have someone who has a voice and influence and credibility in society to represent our beliefs of making AIDS known here on campus.”
Fischetti said one of the greatest challenges the group faces is getting students to get behind its cause.
“It’s hard to get people to care about something that doesn’t directly relate to them,” Fischetti said.
Amy Herrmann, vice president of USC’s chapter of FACE AIDS and a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she also believes the lack of awareness makes the cause less relatable to students.
“Since there is not a lot of awareness on campus it’s hard to get AIDS closer when people feel so distant from it,” Herrmann said.
Varun Soni, dean of Religious Life, said he sees a lack of awareness on campus, but also pointed out a larger problem.
“The lack of awareness around AIDS on our campus is representative of the global lack of awareness around the issue,” Soni said. “Anything we can do to foster a conversation around HIV is important.”
FACE AIDS hopes to grow and, as the only group on campus that specifically works with helping HIV/AIDS victims, it hopes it will be the group that people can go to to fight AIDS.
“All students need to do is be passionate about creating awareness to make a difference and educate the community of USC and eventually the LA community,” Fischetti said.

As organizers begin to tabulate the results of this year’s Good Neighbors Campaign, it appears they will meet their monetary goal but will fall far short of reaching their participation goal.
The Good Neighbors Campaign entered its 15th year of “helping children live their dreams” with two goals — to raise campaign contributions by $100,000 and to increase employee participation by 8 percent. The aim was to have 50 percent of USC employees contribute to raising $1.2 million.
Hitting the mark · A teacher works with a student at the 24th Street Theatre, a program sponsored by the Good Neighbors Campaign, which is on track to meet its 2009 fundrasing goal. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
The campaign, which provides grants for community outreach programs and organizations, officially ended Oct. 31, though donations will continue to trickle in until the end of the year. The preliminary numbers, however, show that while contributions are on track to hit the campaign’s goal, participation has fallen by more than 5 percent compared to last year, according to Campaign Director Carolina Castillo.
Castillo said the campaign considered the economic situation in setting its goals — and tried to keep aspirations reasonable — but ultimately organizers thought it was important to increase their efforts for the sake of the grant recipients who depend on the program for funding.
“We decided we would increase our goal because we felt like the [employees] at USC would step up to the challenge given that the current economic situation is really having an adverse effect on our local communities,” Castillo said.
Castillo said it was important for the campaign to meet its fundraising goal this year because the programs it funds are more in need of grants than ever, given the recent economic rut.
Thomas Sayles, GNC 2009 chair and vice president of government and community relations, said the program always operates with the community programs in mind.
“In tough times it is more important to give,” Sayles said.
The numbers so far miss the mark, but Castillo said by the time final numbers are calculated, the campaign will likely meet its fundraising goal — as of Wednesday, the campaign had reached $1.19 million, just short of its $1.2 million goal.
Participation, however, is low. Involvement had dropped 6 percent as of Wednesday, and though Castillo anticipates the campaign will come close to 40 percent participation, she admitted to being disappointed that it will miss the 50 percent benchmark.
Castillo attributed the drop in part to the economy and the tendency for people to tighten their belts when the economy is in a rut.
“There is a hiring freeze at the university and that wasn’t the case last year at USC,” Castillo said. “There were also no raises across the board, which was not seen last year.”
Though the percentage of faculty members participating dropped, the actual number jumped.
“The employee base grew, but our participation could’ve stayed the same,” Castillo said. “We have 5,100 employees giving this year and last year it was 4,900.”
Another possible reason for the results, Castillo said, was the fact that the university acquired the Norris Cancer Hospital and the University Hospital earlier this year. These two hospitals account for 11 percent of all employees, and Castillo said the campaign got a late start in their fundraising at the hospitals.
Additionally, Castillo said, participation rates may have been abnormally high last year.
Last year, Castillo said, participation rates soared when an anonymous alumnus posed a challenge to the faculty and staff of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. The alumnus said if the college raised its participation rates to 50 percent, he would donate $1 million to the Joint Education Project’s endowment.
With the challenge, participation jumped to 57 percent. This year, however, the College only had a 26 percent participation rate.
Even with participation down, the fact that the campaign will make its monetary goal is most important as many community members depend on their grants.
“We could not do it without USC,” said Jay McAdams, co-founder and executive director of the 24th Street Theatre, which receives funds from the campaign. “The campaign understands that a richer community makes it richer for the students.”

A private event hosted by the USC College Republicans featuring conservative speaker David Horowitz prompted protests and a walkout Wednesday night.
The event came a day after a number of students complained about being denied entrance to the speech. Earlier this week, USC College Republicans said they would bar some individuals affiliated with Students for Justice in Palestine to prevent any disruption.
Fighting words · Students for Justice in Palestine and other students held signs in protest outside Seeley G. Mudd on Wednesday. The group was protesting an event sponsored by USC College Republicans, featuring conservative speaker David Horowitz. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan
Horowitz’s speech focused on the global threat to Judaism and how that fight was taking place on college campuses in the United States.
Horowitz discussed the conflict between Israel and Palestine, describing “Islamofascist” attacks against Jews, and how Islamists had driven them from the West Bank.
“There’s no more threatened people in the world than Jews. That’s the reality,” Horowitz said. “The Arabs are racist.”
About 10 students who were admitted to the event stood up and turned their backs half an hour into the his speech, in response to his characterization of Muslims.
“This is my intolerance for the intolerance,” Horowitz said when the students turned their backs. “These students are either brain-dead or they’re malicious.”
The students were escorted out by Department of Public Safety officers at the event, and were met outside with an uproar of chanting from about 15 demonstrators outside, who were denied entrance because of their affiliation with SJP.
Heather Larabee, the assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities said students were removed because they had disrupted the event.
“They were blocking the views of people behind them, so that’s why they were asked to leave. Had they stood up silently and in the back rows, Horowitz would have been able to see them and that would have been fine,” she said.
According to Larabee, six members of SJP were denied entrance to the event. College Republicans also turned away others who had not signed up for the event, except for a few who waited and were allowed entrance to fill some of the empty seats, even though there were a few remaining ones.
Horowitz spoke about the controversy surrounding his appearance at USC.
“Now I can’t set foot on the USC campus,” he said. “Let me just say the behavior is an utter disgrace and one of the worst cases I have seen.”
Horowitz called the protestors from SJP, the USC Progressive Alliance and Muslim Student Union “fascist thugs.”
“I don’t care what you think of anything I said,” Horowitz told attendees after the protestors inside were escorted out by campus security.
SJP members stood outside before the event and initially protested silently with signs that read, “I refuse to respect hate speech,” “Is my last name a ‘security’ threat?” “Stand with us against racism” and “His hate speech is violating my free speech.”
When the protestors were escorted out, the demonstrators outside began chanting, “Racist” and “Free speech yes, hate speech no.”
“Allowing him to speak at USC legitimizes his racist speech as something that’s academic debate, which it isn’t,” said SJP President Alex Shams, a senior majoring in international relations who participated in the demonstration. “What David Horowitz is saying is hate speech and it’s speech that is offensive to a lot of students on campus and is threatening to a lot of students on campus.”
But Falicia Mandel, the co-chair for the California College Republicans who served as the College Republicans vice president in 2008, said the students didn’t give Horowitz a chance to explain his case.
“I really wish they would have stayed and heard what he had to say, and then if they chose to ask the hard questions … there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a better way to exercise what they’re asking for, which is freedom of speech,” she said.
Larabee said Student Affairs made an effort to ensure both groups were given an opportunity to give their side of the story.
“As a whole, we want to make sure the students demonstrating have a chance to demonstrate and their voices are heard, and the students that wanted the program to happen are having their program,” Larabee said. “We’re not here to judge right or wrong or pick a side at all. It’s just about making sure students have a positive experience, whatever that is for them.”
Larabee said the university will investigate why some students were denied entrance to the event.
Despite Student Affairs’ efforts, Horowitz complained about the treatment of his hosts by the protestors.
“Students that invited me, which is the worst part, are attacked and called racist,” Horowitz said, adding that the discussion of free speech must continue on USC’s campus. “This is a battle and it’s a battle we have to win.”
Horowitz said the groups protesting the College Republicans’ event and attempting to obstruct the speaker they invited should be put on probation for “a heinous assault on USC students.”
“The administration itself is allowing this fascist attempt at free speech … to defile College Republicans,” he said, calling the protestors “lunatics the university refuses to discipline.”
Someone please explain where this argument comes from–“There’s no more threatened people in the world than Jews. That’s the reality,”
I have no legacy of anti-semitism and I have no feelings(neither sympathy/hatred) about jews but I DON’T understand why jews always complain that there community is in a danger.
Then, why don’t you go live in Gaza or Iran… where they practice the “religion of peace” and attempt to practice Judaism there. You won’t be in Israel where those nasty murderous Jews live, so you should be in no danger, right? Certainly it’s safer than going to Jerusalem and practicing Islam, at any rate. Right?
there are 40,000 jews in iran, and israel has offered them money to leave numerous times, as lately as last year. They have refused to leave. Sorry, what contact do you have with the jews of iran that you think you know their situation?
“The term ‘Islamofascist’ is used by … the radical right wing … All due respect, if ‘free speech’ … was the topic, the term would never be bandied about.”
Somebody point this man to the definition of irony.
“This is a campus that promotes critical thinking, research and powerful dialogue based on facts and evidence … I thrive on dialogue with my counter-politically inclined students … No respecting institution of higher education would allow the visit of such a despicable individual to visit its campus”
Then hit him over the head with the dictionary so it’ll sink in.
Kudos to Alex Shams and the progressive student alliance for having the courage to stand up against not only racism and intolerance, but out and out ignorance.  This is a campus that promotes critical thinking, research and powerful dialogue based on facts and evidence.  When we invite hateful people on campus, we deserve the negative publicity, protests and backlash that we get.  USC students are nobody’s fools.  This campus has some of the best and brightest in the country, if not the world.  No respecting institution of higher education would allow the visit of such a despicable individual to visit its campus without protest.
I think Horowitz’s visit seems allegorical to Ahmadinejad’s visit to the U.S., though perhaps fortunately for us Horowitz represents far less of a threat as his circle of influence is comparably miniscule.  They both share empty rhetoric based on half-truths and stereotypes.  Both project their own fears onto “the other”.  In this way, Bush and Bin Laden shared much in common as well… both claimed god to be on their side for what amounted to a virtual holy war (see LA Times Editorial page several years ago, placing their speeches side by side in comparison).
Where is the critical dialogue in this university, especially with speakers such as Horowitz and Coulter?
I have great respect for all groups who employ depthful analysis and criticality in their journey.  Horowitz is not among them.  The term “Islamofascist” is used by performers and entertainers of the radical right wing such as Rush Limbaugh and (on our own campus not too long ago) Ann Coulter.  All due respect, if “free speech” and not “hate speech” was the topic, the term would never be bandied about.  Not only does it isolate an entire religious community, but it misunderstands the term “fascism” in the most heinous and frankly ironic way.
When corporate entities merge with the ruling state, the term “fascism” applies.  The small sector of fundamentalist muslims who gather around the principles put forth by Al Qaeda and others are anything but fascist.  They loathe the corporate / state hegemony.  This is their primary rallying cry, their target.  Bin Laden railed against corporate monopoly and globalization, especially of his famous (Bush-family-friendly) Saudi clan.  And, need we be reminded, liberation (of the mind) comes with our expanded capacity to sustain complexities.
Do the college republicans purport that Horowitz represents complex thinking?  I thrive on dialogue with my counter-politically inclined students – most of whom I find exceptionally intelligent.  I shudder to think that any of them attended this vacuous event.
The college republicans who participated in Horowitz’s visit have shamed their legacy on this campus and ridiculed their academic integrity.  And I know that the vast majority of Republicans find Horowitz as shameful as the vast majority of Democrats are probably embarrassed by similar simplistic sloganeering.
Again, my hat’s off to Alex Shams and the progressive students on campus.  Standing and turning their back on Horowitz, all due respect to Ms. Larrabee, did nothing to block or disrupt a person whose very presence blocks and disrupts the good name of our university.  I find the notion of “neutrality” from USC administrators under these circumstances to be frankly shameful.

ali, do you actually know any of the history of the prophet muhammad?
he died in 632- when islam had only reached the cities of mecca, medina, and the surrounding countryside. How much rape and torture could he have plausibly done by 632 (having fled mecca in 622 for medina), especially given that Medina converted of its volition, and mecca was the city muhammad came from?
i understand if you say the islamic empire killed people- obviously it did, like any empire (say, the roman empire under the christians, or the byzantines?)- but bringing up the prophet shows a wanton disregard of factual history regarding the spread of Islam and the dates as well as regions involved.
after reading all the comments, i’ve concluded Ali is an islamophobe
Kim,
According to your logic (sic) you are a racist for grouping us all together as if we were one uniform class of people deserving of hate.
Oh wait.  I almost forgot.  Racism refers to a race of people.  How can Islam be a race?
Islam is a religion.  Its prophet, Mohammed, spread Islam through murder, rape, piundering, torture, forced conversions, etc…
Since when is stating the facts consdiered a bad thing?
OK… he might not be a “racist” but his attitude is no different than people who are racist. He is saying that the “jew” are beign threatened by “muslims” but there is nothing that can be generalized as “jews” or “muslims.” jews and muslims are simply people who practice certain religion and there is not a single entity that represents(or has legitimacy over) the opinions of all followers. It’s a complete nonsense(aka bullshit) to call “muslim” as murderers or terrorists since only very few people who call themselves muslim commit such ridiculous crimes.
Generalizing muslims as terrorist is the same as calling catholics(Irish Republican Army) as terrorists and protestants(KKK) as racist.
The difference, observer, is that Catholicism does not prescribe the IRA to blow up the British and run around breaking the legs of Protestants.  Islam does prescribe the murder, rape, and enslavement of non-Muslims. It is plainly written in Islam’s scriptures and frequently and loudly expressed by Islam’s religious scholars.
The IRA are terrorists who happen to be Catholic. Islamic terrorists whether they be in the Taliban, the Palestinian territories, or at Fort Hood, are practicing the teachings of a mainstream sect of Islam.
Horowitz IS racist, and apparently, so are a lot of DT commenters. Sure, if he was invited, he has every right to give his speech (and be judged for it), but so too do silent protesters outside the event. If bigoted anti-gay protesters can be found on campus nearly every week, surely these protesters should be allowed as well.
agreed…all this commentary is ridiculous
“You don’t think there’s anyone in this country who thinks that 9/11 was awesome? I think I know where at least one such person is located… in a hospital in Texas under police guard tonight”
Do you have any actual proof of this? Considering that he was under the military’s service for quite sometime…. and given the fact that the military has basically denied it’s terrorist related…
A similar incident happened at this place a few years ago. And these events happen frequently by American (christian) soldiers in Iraq. Are those people who consider 9/11 awesome?
dude ali, wtf is ur problem! if u think anyone thinks that 9/11 was awesome and still lives in this country and goes to school here u are about the dumbest person i’ve ever heard of…
you do realize the days after that happened the whole world was with us.  millions of people across the globe, not just in european nations but in Muslim countries like Iran.
the reason everyone has so much animosity towards the united states right now is because we did something wrong…because we decided to let imperialism and capitalism rule the day, because we failed to be an informed citizenry and we failed to head the warning of our first president who warned us against standing armies and we failed to head the warnings of Eisenhower who said the military-industrial complex was something to be vigilant of.
there’s no point in bickering about it…its just deepening the wounds.
You don’t think there’s anyone in this country who thinks that 9/11 was awesome? I think I know where at least one such person is located… in a hospital in Texas under police guard tonight. At least one other we’re all aware of is leading a mega-church in Chicago. You can’t deny that there exists a virulent, homicidal strain of Islam (not of Muslims, but of Islam) and that it is present even on our shores.
Your “chickens come home to roost” argument is founded in ignorance. If our crime is letting “imperialism rule the day” then show me our empire. Does this have something to do with Guam? And since when is supporting free enterprise a crime that justifies a global jihad against innocent people? Perhaps you should ground your absurd statements in at least a veil of logical argument if you want to be taken seriously.
As I mentioned on the last page, those of you who have made yourselves useful idiots for Islamofascism are in for a rude awakening when you graduate from USC and try to succeed in the adult world. Piece of advice: don’t mention your belief that Israel doesn’t have a right to exist during a job interview.
i don’t deny that radical factions exist in Islam and i don’t deny that their exists equally virulent strains of ppl who claim Christianity as their religion or other religions.  i think any form of religion is a waste of time and that anyone who needs a god to make them act like a decent human being is weak (but that’s just me and im the fucking most terrifying thing America can think of–an ATHIEST!!!!)
im talking about ppl. who go to our school and you know it…and im talking about the countless cases of war profiteering that have taken place in iraq since we’ve gotten there.  ppl are making mad money off of ppl dying and i do consider that a crime.  especially when the day of preemptively attacking iraq was thrown around the day after 9/11
furthermore, no where did i mention that i think israel shouldn’t exist…i just think they should play by the rules everyone else does and not be coddled by the US (and by that i mean given absurd amounts of money and weaponry i think would be better used giving ppl who actually live in this country things like health care and cheaper education)
and i never intend on having a job interview, movies are much better done being the boss, but you’re more than welcome to go about your day 9-5
“i don’t deny that radical factions exist in Islam and i don’t deny that their exists equally virulent strains of ppl who claim Christianity as their religion”
In other words, you do deny that Islam has any particular correlation with homicidal lunacy. Do you really think that “religion” and “ideology” are commodities and there’s no difference between them? That kind of willful ignorance is comforting to kids like yourself, because it seems to say that your general ignorance of life is not a weakness. (Since all ideas and beliefs are equally wrong, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know anything!) Unfortunately in the adult world you have to deal with reality. Nidal Malik Hasan ranting about cutting off the heads of infidels is not equally benign as some Ned Flanders type inviting you to a bible study. Neither our military leaders nor Israel’s protectors have the luxury of living in a politically correct world where a person’s stated political and spiritual beliefs tell you nothing about how they are likely to behave.
yeah, i do deny that…there’s no particular religion with a correlation to homicidal lunacy. homicidal lunacy is a by product of thinking you have no other choice or being promised 40 virgins in heaven (and i blame that on being a piggish male who thinks they have domination over women and that gender is not a construct of society–which dh told me after i approached him very calmly and cordially). i think science is the way to go not religion and i trust those ideas because there’s some smidgen of evidence for them
when i said radical christians i meant the kkk, not a fictional characters on the simpsons.  if u go look @ the kkk website one of the 2nd or 3rd requirements is accepting jesus christ as your personal saviour.
our military leaders shouldn’t even be over in the middle east–its not our homeland–it belongs to both palestinians and israelis and i think if ppl. spent the money on humanitarian aid instead of military than the ppl who are upset about not having homes and their children starving might be more likely to sit down peacefully and discuss a diplomatic solution.
i always think killing ppl. is wrong, i don’t care what they did or who they are, its wrong and i know that its a fact of this reality that ppl. are killed, but i think we’ve done a bad job lessening that reality, we’ve made it more of a reality.  there was no such thing as a suicide bomber in afghanistan till we got there…so i blame us.
Ibn,
You just do NOT get it.  Provide the information showing the last time the KKK -or any Christian supremacist group– killed 13 and wounded 30 as happened yesterday thanks to a “devout” Muslim.
Show us!  Don’t just lie about it as if it were so.
While you are at it…
Show us the last time the KKK was invited to and warmly embraced at a Christian gathering by a diverse group of Christians.  For this is EXACTLY what happened when the genocidal leader of Sudan was invited to and warmly embraced at the Arab League Summit held in Qatar last Spring.  (This WAS in MODERAYE Qatar.)
This is exactly what Horowtiz was talking about two days ago.
How is it all the leaders of the Arab wolrd could invite and embrace a genocidal leader as if he were Humpty Dumpty instead of the sadistic pig that he is?  Does this suggest Horowitz is correct, i.e., Muslims do accept genocidal leaders –and even embrace them– as it is part of their core ethos?  Remember, Mohammed WAS a warrior who killed many, many non-Muslims as “part of his job” as the warrior prohpet of Islam.
Riddle us that one Ibn.
Or, if you cannot explain why this is so common place in the Muslim world than tell us clearly why you are opposed to these actions by Muslims.  (Watch Ibn will not condemn these acts just as he almost certainly did not condemn the acts of the 19 Muslims who carried out 9/11.)
Directly from the Page of the KKK
You must be a free white male or female of European descent, at least 18 years of age. (we do verify age)
You must be able to profess faith in Jesus Christ as personal Savior
You must not be married to or date people of other races, nor have mixed race dependants, this includes adopted children.

NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS THINKS THIS IS RIGHT!!!!! NOT ANY “REAL” CHRISTIAN
JUST LIKE NO “REAL” MUSLIM  THINKS EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE AWESOME
When people embrace organizations like this, it is because they have no other choice.  If you were a Palestinian and you children were starving and not a single Christian tried to help you, but Hamas offered your starving children food and humanitarian aid…what would you do?
i love how Ali eckman points to one organization that as a Muslim I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, and no muslims i’ve talked to have, and thinks ALL muslims are part of it or have something to do with it.
This is what a generalization is, and this is what racism and Islamophobia are. Imagine if i took every statement the Klan made, and said “this is what white people agree with!!” This is how I feel when you write this- absolutely offended.
So if we’re gonna talk about racism, and the USC College Republicans, this is what I mean.
I’m always just baffled by online posts because non of them are ever in context or make any sense.  They’re only good for a few laughs.
I don’t understand how these protesters were let in…
I thought everything David Horowitz said was very level headed and he brought a very reasoned response to what they were protesting.  If they had listened instead of so rudely disrupting they would have found that out.  As a former alumnus of USC I’m astonished that the administration would allow such events to take place.
I think the next logical step is to follow through on what DH said and look into SJPs funding of the Taliban and their systematic genocide of campus Jews.  I think its pretty clear considering the number of Muslims in SJP that they are being funded by Hamas.  Its time for the Christians to take back USC and steer it back towards its conservative roots of upstanding, white God-fearing individuals from dignified old money and entrepreneurs.
Jack,
You are right.  But you are wrong when the truth is the truth.
A few hours ago a devout Muslim American soildier killed a dozen American soildiers at Fort Hood.  This is the truth.
The killer was a devout Muslim.  This is the truth.
Muslims have killed close to 500,000 people in Sudan.  This is the truth.
Muslims have killed or threatened to kill many people like David Horowitz.  This IS the truth and it is why people like Horowtiz have security details protecting them 24/7.  Ask Salman Rushdie or Ayaa Ali Hirsi if this is the truth.
You might ask Theo Van Gogh if this is true but a Muslim killed him.  This is true.
And the following video is true too.  The video is not scripted and the people speaking are not actors.  They’re real Muslims threatening to kill a guy not all that different than David Horowtiz.  They even mention Theo Van Gogh as an example of someone who was killed by a Muslim for speaking out about Islam and Muslims.  This IS true, unless you can show me where it isn’t.

Ali,
Your truth is not THE truth.
there is only one truth…join me
The nerve of Horowitz for telling the truth to college students!  Why didn’t he just do the PC thing like the other “professors”?
Here are some direct quotes from the Islamic Awakening Forum’s website.  Weird that it is exactly what Horowitz was saying and yet people claim he is an “Islamophobe” instead of a realist:
“One who defends the honour of his brother, Allah keeps the fire of hell away from his face on the Day of Judgment.”
“But anyway, a brave and honorable mujahid indeed. I’m sure he was perfectly OK with the treachery of taking the military oath of service, training with other loyal Americans, and then turning his guns on them. But the good thing is that it shows the world how clever Muslims are. “
Ummm….Is this what Horowitz was tlaking about?
Islamic Awakening Forum on Fort Hood shooter: “What a brave mujahid”
Misunderstanders of Islam abound on this thread at Islamic Awakening, discussing the jihad shooting at Fort Hood today.

Re: As many as 9 killed in Fort Hood shootings, officials say
reports now are saying that the shooter was a convert(revert) to Islam, a Major(officer) in the army
Allahu akbar insha Allah he be shaheed, what a brave mujahid
One of the most interesting things that develops from these types of responses is really seeing how people measure themselves against the political establishment. My observations have concluded many right-leaning Zionists and/or supporters of Horowitz and Israel truly belief they are of the minority in the college system and that they are actually being threatened in the United States.
This is a contradictory position considering the prominence of the AIPAC lobby in Congress, not to mention recent U.S. actions regarding Israel. As far as I know they are still receiving $3 billion and they are a major purchaser of U.S. defense contracts. If I also recall correctly they are one of the few members of the United Nations to vote against bringing the Goldstone report further. And, additionally, Obama’s Administration called for a “settlement freeze” in the West Bank but recently stopped pushing for that.
You can debate whether or not Israel is justified or that America is justified in supplying Israel arms. But it is indisputable that the U.S. government unequivocally supplies Israel and that without the former, Israel would probably not last that long… I don’t know of many countries that can start 2 wars in 3 years and get away with it. That said, I really wish that the debate would stop being about “well you’re being brainwashed and I know what I am talking about” or being incredulous towards the other persons point of view. Honestly the discussion should center around the actual content and data.
And one last thing in this little tirade-how exactly is this article biased? And remember bias doesn’t mean disagreeing with you, it means the author takes a clear slant towards one side by excluding certain facts. I won’t argue this is a masterpiece of journalism but she quoted both sides of the debate..
Jack,
If the following is the same UN you and I have in mind tell me why anyone should take any of their resolutions seriously?  When the likes of Libya and Syria rule the roost and you take their words as gospel than that tells me all I need to know about you.  Libya and human rights in the same sentence makes most thinking beings laugh out loud, but evidently not you.
Last night, Horowitz made very generalized statements against Muslims and Palestinians that could undoubtedly be fueled by a racist perspective or AT LEAST instill racism in others:
He exclaimed that “THEY (PALESTINIANS) HATE THEIR OWN CHILDREN! THEY STRAP BOMBS TO THEM AND TELL THEM TO KILL THEMSELVES!”
No, he was NOT referring only to “Islamofascists” here. He did not make a single distinction in the context of this quote between the general Palestinian population and the “Islamofascists” to whom he often refers.
He also stated that Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza should move to Jordan to make way for Israelis in the Palestinian territories. Therefore, even though he stated beforehand that it was genocidal for Arabs to oppose the existence of Israel, he stated that he opposed the existence of Palestinians in Palestine? According to his logic, he is supporting genocidal perspectives as well!
LASSSSTLY, I talked to him afterward and he admitted that he had never even been to Israel!!! Therefore, he sure as heck hasn’t been to Palestine!! How DARE he generalize the perspectives and desires of Palestinian civilians when he has never even been to Palestine and interacted with them??? He has never even witnessed the events that he so fervently decries.
This man is a moron. That speech was such a waste of my time.
For CAA.
You are talking about loving your home and that people want to force you out. Don’t you realize that there were 750,000 Palestinians who were expelled from their own homeland which now is Israel. Don’t all these people have the same rights as you think Israelis should? That’s what SJP is fighting for. People who were thrown out forcefully and for the current conditions of the Palestinian people who are in the tiny winy of what is left of Palestine which clearly Israel doesn’t give equal rights to.
david horowitz sounds suspiciously like donna horowitz.  i would like to propose that he is a cyborg here to create controversy!!!!!!
Would you people learn to spell, use good grammar and capitalize the first letter of a sentence?  You sound like third graders!
People who kill people suck. Good arguments all around.
“brain-dead and malicious” lol. that’s so funny…i know all those people, they spend almost all their time cooking food for homeless people, playing with baby chickens and having water fights in kiddie pools I can see why david horowitz needed so many armored guards.
What a non-sequitur response. Besides your mis-quote (the correct one is “brain-dead OR malicious”), you need to take Mr. Horowitz’s words in context:
“Brain-dead” here means unable to personally form a rational opinion after being presented the facts. This would apply to any non-Muslim SJP members who take propaganda from Hamas and it’s ilk, spread it like the Gospel, and pretend to champion the Palestinian cause in their name when there is countless evidence to show that these groups are the true criminals against the Palestinian people. People who show metaphorical brain activity should be able to put 2 and 2 together and see that something is wrong with what radical Islam presents to the West.
“Malicious” here refers to people who know what radical Islam presents to West, understand that (for instance) Hamas is trying to kill every Jew and Israeli on the planet and that Iran is trying to attain nuclear weapons for the same purpose and support them anyways either because of their own anti-Semitism or because of other religious beliefs. On college campuses these are generally Muslim pro-Islamofascist students and their sole extracurricular mission is to slander Israel’s humanitarian efforts and sovereign rights.
I can assure you, there were Nazi death camp guards who were married and loved their kids. Didn’t mean they weren’t compatible with the attempted genocide of non-Aryans across Europe.
lmao…can i meet u in person AB, i’d love to chat over coffee or something so you can teach me what “non-sequitur” means and hear you’re opinion on what really happened inside.  im not even kidding either…please, please meet with me
but since you took the time to clarify things for me i’d like to say that those people still aren’t brain-dead or malicious…some of them were even Jewish
Jeffery,
If I may be so blod as to jump in here…
The “News” section of The Daily Trojan is not meant as a dating site but as a site to exchange ideas.  You might try it sometime.
AB countered your sophomoric comments with some excellent insights and you responded with some senseless drivel and an invitation to coffee.
Somehow I doubt AB is interested in having coffee with you, but would be interested in hearing if you have anything to say about the topic at hand that actually adds to the debate.
lmao again!!!!! i guess sarcasm isn’t ur strong suit…im making fun of u guys…none of this is actually adding to the…what do u call it? oh yeah, “debate”… please
and i think discussing something over coffee is far better than mudslinging via internet, although i imagine if i did go with AB to coffee (or u) i have a feeling it would end very quickly in me throwing the coffee in ur face
Ibn writes, “most murders in the US are committed by Christians.”  Well, duh!  Given the demogrpahics of the US it would be pretty amazing if this were not the case.
Ibn writes, “all examples of violent Christian expansion”.  Even if all of this were true, and I am not agreeing that all of it is so, this is no excuse for Islam’s sins.  Are you saying that just because someone else does it we can too?
I do not disagree that Christianity committed grave, awful sins which resulted in millions of deaths, but there IS a profound difference between Christianity and Islam.  Very profound.
Christianity was founded by a man of peace who lived a life of peace, who preached peace to all his followers.
Islam was founded by a man who was a warrior, who practiced warfare in his pursuit of expanind Islma’s reach, who taught his followers to emulate his deeds of war, rape, enslavement and pillaging in the never-ending pursuit of the expansion of Islam.
Islam is unique among the religions for having a prophet of Mohammed’s ilk.  It is little wonder that today’s Islamists quote the Koran when beheading their prisoners, who shout out Allah Akbar when killing and raping their victims, who justify killing women and children using words from the Koran and Hadiths.
Christianity committed grave sins and is still suffering from the “karma” inherited from these sins –witness your comment as an example of this karma smacking Christians straight in the face– but Islam is far worse and far more insidious.
All one has to do is to google the sermons of Islam’s modern Clerics and Imans to see what Islam is all about, and it has nothing to do with compassion, tolerance and peace.  These are Christian ideals and despite the many examples of Christianity not always living these ideals, and often guilty of the opposite, this does not refute that Jesus’ life and teachings were all about always striving towards this path.  Mohammed’s life and teachings could not be much further from Jesus’ and the fact that in the 21st century we can see this VERY clearly pretty much says all we need to know.
I agree…I think your post leads to the conclusion that all religions commit terrible atrocities more often then not.  I don’t think there is any religion that is more insidious than any other.  I think anyone pushing their religion in other people’s faces is pretty insidious and we know all the big religions do that all the time The people in power simply tell all their followers to do things and those people listen hoping their god will save them.
I think its time for people to grow some sense and realize that religion is more trouble than its worth.  The so called “ideals of Christianity” are simply survival mechanism people evolved in order to survive without killing each other constantly (we know how good we are at that).
Let’s just smoke a joint and have a campfire.  People will agree after that
Many writes,  “I don’t think there is any religion that is more insidious than any other.”
Is that why every sigdle day we hear about Buddhist suicide bombings?
You might consider learning just the basics behind “the big religions” before pretending to know anything about them.
Let me help you get started.
1)  Mohammed planned and participated in wars.  He killed, raped, took slaves, had a dozen wives, and encouraged his followers to emulate his example.
2)  Buddha felt any death, even a small insect’s death, was a loss.
3)  Jesus was a man of peace who turned his other cheek.
well since u love jesus so much why don’t you do what he says and “turn your cheek” to all the muslims you so clearly hate…
i think he also said something about loving your enemy…so u can try doing that to
to ali,
I never said I loved Jesus, I just wrote a small amount about his life and how he lived.
I am not one to allow sadistic fasicts to get away with genocide, much ess murdering friends or family.  This is just one of a hundred ways, I suppose< I’m a lot different than Jesus.
When Muslims, in the name of Islam, kill hundreds of thousands of innocents in Sudan I personally find it wrong to turn the other cheek.  That’s just me.
When Muslims, in the name of Islam, threaten to wipe out noble, good people like the Jews in Israel, I find it wrong to look the other way.
What can I tell you?  I guess I’m not Jesus.
most murders in the US are committed by Christians..
the crusades, the hundred years war, the Colonization of Africa, of the Americas (estimated 25 million Aztecs alone died), the colonization of asia, the colonization of the middle east, the colonization of australia, the european religious wars of the 1500’s, the “Reconquista” (which expelled all muslims and jews from iberia), the byzantine wars v the zoroastrian persians….
all examples of violent Christian expansionism.
RA,
I ask you one more time:  You can judge me, you can try me, and you can convict me, and you can hate me too; but please tell me what it is I have written that is untrue.
I will make this easy for you.  I, Ali, am the biggest jerk in the world, but my central thesis about Islam being a religion founded by a warrior and whose religion has expanded through violence, rape and mayhem (see Sudan, Somalia, Kashmir, etc…)  is typical of this religion.  A religion that lacks compassion, tolerance or any peaceful intentions toward non-Muslims.
Please, please tell this jerk –Ali– where his thesis is wrong.  (And, while you’re at it, why is it the dozen army personnel killed today in Texas happened to have been killed by a Muslim?  Is this just a weird conincidence seeing as though less than 6% of the US’s population is Muslim…it seems statistically unlikely that another Muslim would be involved in wanton acts of murder like this, no?  Unless, of course this is to be expected from Muslims because of the indocrination they receive from the cradle to the grave.)
dude, people kill people all the time.  it’s not because they adhere to a certain religion, its because they are desperate to make a statement.
you’re doing exactly what david horowitz said not to do which was categorically classify muslims as people who kill other people.
he said he wasn’t racist, but you listened to him and what you’re saying now sounds racist (yes i know Islam is not a race so don’t tell me that)–i think that’s why people were protesting.
Ali, there’s a lot of people who aren’t as smart as you and when they listen to things Glen Beck says they take him seriously.  I come from one of those places and they all want to blow up Iran for absolutely no reason besides that its Iran.  I think that’s the point, so many people are uneducated and are willing to listen to someone like david horowitz
“War against Judaism”…please better fact-checking next time. It was a war against Jews. The Jewish people and the Jewish religion are not the same thing.
Just something stupid that the editors should have really caught.
If you look at even a modicum of Jewish History you will find that they are one and the same.
It’s sad, but there is truly no more seething hive of anti-semitism in the United States than the college campuses. (Except the mosques, of course!) There is a whole industry of bottom-feeders in this country (e.g. CalPIRG) who manipulate college students to fill their ranks and fill their wallets, because they know that you don’t understand the issues but you like singing protest songs. When you are 25 or 30 years old, you’ll be appalled at what you were talked into doing and saying for this evil movement. Anti-semitism doesn’t go over so well in the adult world as it does in college.
I mean, come on, “His hate speech is violating my free speech”? You’ve gotta be kidding.
Joe-thank God people think like you. APPLY COMMON SENSE PEOPLE. Right, “his hate speech is violating my free speech?” Seriously-find something better to fight over.
Here’s another, “is my last name a security threat?” get over your “rights” and respect other opinions.
good thing there were a lot of anti-semetic jews in the protest as well
@Ali
Your comments help the readers know exactly what kind of human beings David Horowitz is creating through his campaign.
The DT has run many biased or plain-trash articles in the past, but this one really takes the cake.
Here was the essence of Horowitz’s speech: there are violent passages in the Koran, there are violent statements made by Muslim leaders in governments and organizations, and the rest of the (peaceful) Muslim community does nothing to denounce them.  Horowitz strongly advocated for the rights of women and homosexuals in Muslim societies.  He also spent twenty minutes speaking with a girl one-on-one from SJP.  Funny how none of that made the article.
You claim that some students were turned away because of their race.  The GOP made it clear that they wanted people to RSVP by Tuesday.  SOME students got in without being on the list because they knew members of the club.  You are basing that claim on hearsay, nothing more.
Kyriacou, you are a disgrace to journalism and our university.
–Greg Rathjen
you know what else i thought was funny in the article all us little students being thugs, i’m like 5’2” most 5th graders are bigger than me
Greg-I attended the event too, and your absolutely right. Why can’t people see this? Horowitz also mentioned that our freedom of speech (if obama doesnt take that away) is the one thing we must preserve. Why can’t SJP and the other organizations affiliated understand that the repubs on campus have the FREEDOM OF SPEECH. it’s simple.
only from 12-2pm at Tommy Trojan though. mwahahahah
http://www.boingboing.net/2007/02/02/usc-protestors-sent-.html
Oooooppss posted twice sorry, didn’t see the first post. all respect to the DT! take down that comment if you want
But CAA- there you can see some of his offensive comments.
Again. What was D.H. saying that offended your group so much? Please re-read your history books and look at what leaders in Arab nations are threatening to do to Israel today, can you understand what one purposely sent nuclear weapon could do to that small nation? How can you continue to perpetuate the hate of the Jews and Israel.  They must be strong when everyone in the region is trying so hard to wipe them out.  If you lived in a house somewhere, anywhere, and the rest of the town was trying to destroy you, to force you to leave your home, that you loved … what would you do … the rest of the town has plenty of room, they control the town, they don’t need your little home … you just want to live there in peace.
Young people have so much to give to the world, why not start with compassion, understanding and tolerance for others ideas and faith.
how about some compassion, understanding, and tolerance for muslims, palestinians and jews…
ps. Israel, as small as it is in the middle east is backed by billions of dollars from the most powerful & influential country in the world (United States) and is the only country there with nuclear weapons
i know jews have been persecuted and thats awful, it always is…but i think you should know that the people who protested spend every saturday cooking food for the homeless people around USC campus, i’ve never seen a single “college republican” at those things
Actually, College Republicans each year have events like that. Every year they support the troops in some way, they’ve been known to support cancer causes and the like. In fact, I’ve never seen the “college democrats” supporting the very people that defend your freedom.
When you have some twisted and negative view of a republican, you might want to check your facts. FACT: the most conservative cities in the U.S. DONATE (give money or goods for a good cause, just in case you need the definition) the most. Democratic cities-none.
Stop trying to use propaganda and your stupid mind to justify why Republicans don’t spend their time feeding the homeless. Your useless, just like them.
im not a democrat so i wouldn’t know…..i think both sides are completely ridiculous.  im glad u take the time out of your busy schedule to feed homeless people. kudos to u
conservative cities tend to have more money because guess what conservative people tend to have a lot of money since a majority of them (white ppl.) have privileged positions, just like the both of us who attend an excellent university (so i doubt if either of our minds are stupid, check the deans list)
I want to let people know the extent to which the event was disrupted by us protesters inside the event.  After 20 minutes, about 15 of us students stood up silently with their backs turned to Horowitz.  The students were completely silent.  Horowitz and DPS asked us to leave and we left promptly, also in complete silence.
In total, the event was disrupted for about 2 minutes and the protest was not one of commotion.  I don’t want any group to see this as a precedent for protesting events in the future by being loud or vocally disruptive inside an event.
As a statement, I thought our silent and controlled protest weakened Horowitz’s claims that we were a bunch of “fascist thugs” bent on perpetrating a “second holocaust” against the Jews, and that the organizations we participate in fund terrorists like Hamas and the Taliban.
I am 60 years old, I have two family members who have graduated from SC. I am ashamed of what I just read regarding the treatment of David Horowitz. Throughout my life I have seen and heard vile attacks on Jews in real time, and just read any credible history book.  Jews are persecuted no matter what they do, they try to make concessions, they are persecuted, they defend their homeland, they are persecuted.
They are hated by Arabs & Muslims as a way of life for the haters.  Talk about denying
free speech … what was the Palestinian group trying to do to D.H.  The tiny country of Israel is all the Jews have … and the surrounding countries even want to deny them their home. What on earth is wrong with these haters.  It’s too bad those foolish students didn’t sit down, shut up and listen to David Horowitz … they may have learned something very valuable.
Isn’t it ironic, that the Daily Trojan refers to Horowitz as  “controversial”, for simply espousing a different point of view than that carried by the left wing.  So much for “diversity”.
So some people walked out.  They weren’t supposed to be there in the first place.
So there are protests.   That’s the American Way – peaceful demonstration outside the venue, not disrupting it.
I’m not sure how productive these conversations really are, and I’m starting to think it’s getting quite personal. Both sides have made choices that appear to have slighted the other. We need more productive discussions that can get the facts and histories on the table – AND also highlight the important role of forgiveness, apology, redemption.
We need the voices and stories of those also affected by the conflict in this – and not only of males, but also of mothers, children, Arab Jews, Jewish Arabs, Christian Israelis, Druze Israelis – and not only those involved in violence, but also those involved in the peace movements in the middle east.
Our own opinions, as college students in America, are covered by textures of privilege that may be first hard to comprehend. Social justice plays an important part of this, but so does social progress. I would recommend the text Anatomy of Peace by the Arbinger Institute that comments very powerfully on this.
Lastly, there is the aspect of socioeconomic inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor, inequitable access to education, jobs, food, and water in the region. These are issues that most be addressed together — not through exclusion or dominance — to truly move forward on these developmental issues. Why not have a joint discussion between SJP and Republicans on this issue?
Call me idealistic, but this is the only way it’s going to work.
I really like what you’ve said and agree that only discussion between the two sides will help to actually discuss the real ISSUES in this conflict….not just the mudslinging about who is or is not racist.
Unfortunately, last night’s event with Horowitz took us a step away from this goal. Many of those students affected by the conflict were denied entrance to the event and could not get their questions to Horowitz in the first place. And why? Because they have been active on campus trying to raise awareness of the conflict and the plight of Palestinians. And Horowitz himself said people campaigning for the Palestinian cause are nothing but “fascist thugs,” “Jew-haters,” “the shame of USC” and “Nazis.” If Horowitz and those who agree with him really believe these things, than how can a joint discussion ever work?
I too want to see a joint discussion, but if the College Republican actually believe these hateful things Horowitz said about SJP (he accused them of sending money to the Taliban–I challenge him to offer up that evidence), than I fear a joint discussion would be more of the same — name calling and each side asserting they care more about freedom/equality/peace etc than the other.
I hope I’m wrong and I hope the next campus event about Israel and Palestine results in productive dialogue.
Idealistic,
I sometimes think more damage is done to mankind by idealists than by most any other group.  I understand your goals are likely deeply felt but that does not mean they work.  One might argue Hitler was an idealist.  A supremacist, for sure, but imbued with an insane form of idealism too?
Here are some definitons of idealist:
Noun 1. idealist – someone guided more by ideals than by practical considerations
dreamer
Don Quixote – any impractical idealist (after Cervantes’ hero)
romantic – a soulful or amorous idealist
visionary – a person given to fanciful speculations and enthusiasms with little regard for what is actually possible
well i can see why there’s not going to be any productive discussion—cause what you basically just said is you don’t want to have one
Mr. Magoos writes, “I am outraged…”
Thank you for letting us know how you feel.  Your feelings are germaine to this debate and we ALL care very much how you feel.  I feel pretty good in case you were wondering.
Mr. Magoos then writes, “I hope USC will do something in reparation to those denied entry…”
What would you suggest the reparations should be, Mr. Magoos?  Should it be similar to a price of a movie ticket?  Please let us understand your logic for the need for reparartions and what amount we’re talking about here.  You do know USC’s endowment has been hurt by the credit crisis so I hope you will take this into consideration when making your demands.
While you’re thinking about the dollar amount I thought I would share this video with you to help you calm your rage.  You’ll find the link below….feel better,
The most extraordinary NGO statement was delivered by Col. Richard Kemp, former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan, who served with NATO and the UN, and commanded troops in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Macedonia. Speaking under the auspices of UN Watch, he declared solemnly at the start and as his conclusion: “Based on my knowledge and experience, I can say this: During Operation Cast Lead, the Israeli Defence Forces did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any army in the history of warfare.” His words should be heard by all:
http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/conferences/unhrc/special/12th/hrc091016am1-eng.rm?start=01:21:35&end=01:24:18 (2¾ minutes – UN webcast – RealPlayer)
My joint statement follows (with UN webcast); it concluded with a famous quotation from the Book of Daniel: Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
I am outraged by this.. I hope USC will do something in reparation to those denied entry and I seriously hope they do something to condemn GUESTS condemning student groups and directly targeting students. Especially when the speaker is 70 and obviously has a lot of time on his hands for him to be able to mess with 20 year olds like that…
If the man has 10 personal guards, he MUST be doing something wrong.
your ridiculous. people who were denied entry were the ones who threatened the speaker and the club. don’t you think safety is more important than people who want to “listen” to horowitz. get a life
First and foremost, I appreciate the fact that Mr. Sham and his group protested, slandered numerous upstanding people, threatened the safety of the this event, and received biased coverage from The Daily Trojan – because now, students and people in general can see who these groups really are.  The pure and simple fact is that The Daily Trojan sold their soul in order to hit the College Republicans – simply because they are on the left and the CR’s are on the right.  It’s amazing how fast journalistic integrity flies out the window.  Think about it – look who you are supporting – the word idiot is far too kind for the journalists and the editorial staff.
One of the main issues here is the fact that people are complaining they were denied entrance to the event.  First, it was a private event.  This has been stated, over and over and over again.  It was cleared by more than one governing body at USC.  What does it take for this group to understand that.  I would think some intelligence would come into play here – evidently not.  I had a birthday party a few weeks ago, you were not invited, but no complaints from you – it’s that simple.  Additionally, Mr. Sham noted that his group should stop or interrupt this event by any means possible.  How would you read into this?  How did the DT miss this, or at least have an issue with this?
What’s even more pathetic,  is that if the shoe was on the other foot, Mr. Sham and his group would be crying real loud about their treatment.
Since the logic is very clear here – we must ask ourselves, why must this pathetic group continue on with this nonsense.  The answer is clear:  This is all they have.  They have no real stance or argument.  The only way to get some publicity is to rely on a leftist media outlet, in this case The Daily Trojan, to report inaccurate data – a common occurrence.
I invite others reading this shameful article and others like it in the past to take a stance.  How long is America going to put up with political correctness to protect groups such as this?   Maybe we should all attend your next private event Mr. Sham, claim you are being racist, slander your members and create drama to further our goals…….So, let’s get this started:
Mr. Sham, you are acting like a racistst, I am offended.  You should be thrown out of the school.  Anyone else?
mr. sham is a figment of your imagination…talk about getting facts straight. horowitz couldn’t even figure out the real name of the person supposedly attacking him
RA are you RK’s twin sister?
RA writes, “…they (the college republicans) have gone to their own extreme pcokets…:
College Republicans,
Is it true your pockets are extreme?  I’d always thought you all dressed pretty conservatively and that your pockets were more Brooks Brothers than Urban Outfitters, but what do I know.
At this point I’m so confused I’m beginning to think Islam is a race, and a race that hates extreme pockets.  Do I have this right?
All kidding aside, Horowitz simply stated the truth.  He backed it up with many examples.  Islam is a supremacist RELIGION (not race).  The Koran and Hadiths are FILLED with chapter and verse stating exactly this fact.  Kafirs (non-Muslims) are second class citizens.  Muslims are superior, i.e., supreme, i.e., supremacists.
You would have to be a blind, deaf, mute and dumb monkey to not see this fact enacted every day throughout Asia, Africa and coming to a town near you soon.  Be it in Sudan where all non-Muslims are systematically being wiped off the planet or in Saudi Arabia where every single non-Muslim has been wiped off that countries desert sands it’s as plain to see as the fact that Islam is not a race but a collection of people of all colors practicing repression as one.
If someone wants to debate this specific point then let’s have at it, but the silly comments about race and pockets is off point and an attempt to distract from the many substantial and well documented things Horowitz really said.
RK writes, “it amazes me that even after listening to horowitz’s racism and general lunacy…”
Anyone who has an opinion on this subject matter and thisnk Islam is a “race” is a lunatic.
An ideal response by students against an individual trying to legitimize his hatred of African-americans, Muslims, and all other groups of people he vilifies through his campaigns. It was disgraceful for the college republicans to invite Mr Horowitz in the first place. In times when they should try to rethink their values and views, they have gone to their own extreme pockets and brought someone who openly calls out for intolerance against communities. What the students did makes me believe that America still has a future for its people.
thank you christianna for a great article!
it amazes me that even after listening to horowitz’s racism and general lunacy, there are students defending him! He claimed MSU was part of a network funding the Taliban for goodness’ sake! In fact, his ideas regarding a Muslim brotherhood or conspiracy against him, and America, and against Jews, and freedom- sounds AWFULLY suspicious like the anti-semitism that exists in many parts of the world- i.e. blaming a group of people for everything wrong with everything.
Also, ATTACKING students who are protesting as “Brain Dead or Malicious”?? This is a guy who is obviously scared and dumb and just likes lashing out!
Anyways, again, nice article- though I counted 15 people walking out.
The main theme of Horowitz’s speech is that once you lose your right of freedom of speech, you lose all your rights. College Republicans exercised their right of freedom of speech by bringing Horowitz to speak to campus. The event was PRIVATE as it was entirely privately funded. No one in College Republicans ever objected to SJP or Progressive Alliance expressing their views. But, what SJP and Progressive Alliance attempted to do is block freedom of speech by slandering David Horowitz and College Republicans and attempting to disrupt Horowitz’s speech. The SJP students were denied entrance becuase they spread e-mails, facebook messages, and fliers calling to disrupt the speech using “any means necessary.” College Republicans refused to allow another student organization to disrupt its speaker from expressing his views College Republicans cleared it’s course of action with Heather Larabee of Student Affairs before proceeding with the event.
Horowitz is not a racist or an islamaphobe. He believes that the jewish state has a right to exist and that the jewish state is a beacon of human rights and democracy in a sea of totalitarian Islamo-facist regimes that opress women, gays, and reliogus minorities. One of the worst things an organization can be called is racist. Shame on SJP and Progressive Alliance for not intellectually debating David Horowitz but instead turning their backs on him in protest and slandering him with vicious and untruthful rhetoric. Additioanlly, this article is extremely one-sided and pulls David Horowitz’s quotes out of context.
“Horowitz is not a racist or an islamaphobe. He believes that the jewish state has a right to exist and that the jewish state is a beacon of human rights and democracy in a sea of totalitarian Islamo-facist regimes that opress women, gays, and reliogus minorities.”
Shame on Horowitz.  How could anyone be so ridiculous as to say the Muslim Middle East is a  totalitarian region where repression of women, gays and religous minorities happens.
The following short video proves just how wrong Horowitz really is:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qxjocm5fCc
I tried to intellectually debate him after the event.  I very calmly and politely asked him why he thought black, gender, and postcolonial studies were dangerous (said on Fox news, and he admitted to me had indeed said it) then proceeded to mumble some things about “what does that even mean.” So I told him he should tell me cause he’s the one who said it.  Then he told me gender was biological–but in all the biology classes i’ve ever taken, “sex” is biological “gender” is constructed.  I asked him why as someone who is not a woman he thinks he has any idea what women’s issues really are and how parents buying their girls dolls or boys trucks wasn’t construction.    At this point he tried his best to run away and refused to engage in a level headed conversation with me.
Horowitz seems to do a very good job of slandering himself. The MSU funding the Taliban? Israel surrounded by Islamo-fascists? Has he never heard of Lebanon, with its carefully-structured government that ensures Christians and Muslims cannot overpower each other? Plus, Israel has peace treaties and working relations with both Jordan and Egypt. Are Jordanians Islamo-fascists? Egypt has been holding the Rafah crossing closed for Israel for two years now. Nice way to talk about the few countries that are trying to engage with Israel.
The only members from SJP that were denied entrance were the ones with Arabic or Muslim names. Several members of SJP with non-Arabic/Muslim names were allowed into the event. Also, several Arab and Muslim students who do not have any affiliation to SJP or any other group protesting the event were denied entrance. This is clearly  racial profiling and College Republicans cannot be allowed to do something like this. Hopefully the university responds appropriately, and I think the Daily Trojan should independently investigate how the RSVPs were handled to confirm if racially profiling occurred. Regardless of anything Horowitz said, no student group at USC should be racially profiling their attendees. That is simply despicable.
Since when did Islam becone a race?
I thought it was a religion.
In my studies of Islam I could swear it IS a religion founded by a warrior and rapist named Mohammed.  Have I studied the wrong source material?  Is the Koran and the Hadith not good source material for understanding Islam?
But “Arab” is a race and many Muslim names are of Arabic origins
christianna kyriacou…you might want to consider giving up Journalism. That was the most ONE SIDED piece, including photo, that I have ever read in a college publication. The NYTimes & others in the U.S.State Controlled Media would welcome you with open arms & “pay” you for your bias. You are the opposite of “fair & balanced”.
I was at this speech tonite and his message was basically that if we do not respect our Freedom of Speech (including engaging in debate with others who may disagree with us), that all our other freedoms will quickly disappear. He was rational. Clear headed. Loaded with historical facts. And an excellent, intelligent, persuasive speaker. He is someone who helps us to take the blinders of predjudice off & helps you to see the truth of the matter. You should be ashamed of your depiction of this lecture. It is a dis-service to those who come to understand & appreciate TRUTH. Stop trying to be a “hero” that champions causes that only a vocal & abrasive FEAR-mongering minority try to advance. Your hate of others who disagree with you can blind you as it has others. Look at how Muslims treat their WOMEN (birkas-seen & not heard), WESTERNERS/INFIDELS (they cut-their-heads-off if they don’t kiss up to Mohammed!) Believe me, I was in your position a few years back. TG I saw the error of your ways & chose a better way.
Can you be surprised that Ms. Kyriacou wrote the article the way she did when she’s a member of Trojans for Civil Liberties? Of course she’s going to be a little more concerned with allowing pro-hate (MSA) and pro-terrorist (SJP) groups the right to “free speech” without considering a) what it is they advocate, b) the points made against them, c) the ad-hominem and physical attacks launched against Mr. Horowitz, d) the utter lack of respect shown by SJP members towards not just Mr. Horowitz, but College Republicans and the people in attendance during their “protest” and finally e) the role and importance of journalistic and editorial integrity. Recognize that by attempting to write an even-handed report, you legitimize both sides – and you just legitimized documented pro-hate and pro-terrorist groups on campus that the administration is too afraid to shut down under this holy banner of “academic freedom”. There is no such thing as academic freedom when groups like these distort the very meaning of the term.
Civil liberties = hate and terrorism
nice conclusion, i bet dr. king jr. will be happy with how well you know civics
TJ,
Because you made such narrow-minded comments about a particular group of people, i.e. Muslims, you lost all credibility in your argument. For instance, when you want to make a legitimate argument against someone who is being biased it might help not to be biased yourself.
Hope this helps!

In his four years at USC, Taylor Mays has picked up plenty of superlatives. On Wednesday, the senior safety made the cut for two awards that would further add to his resume.
Mays was named a semifinalist for both the Bednarik Award, given to the best defensive player in college football, and the Thorpe Award, given to the best defensive back in college football. Some may be surprised to see Mays on the list because he has just one interception this year, but last year he was named a Thorpe Award finalist with no interceptions. He eventually lost out to Ohio State’s Malcolm Jenkins, however, so maybe a little stat-padding could help his cause.
The 6-foot-3 safety has been active in the secondary, however. With 55 tackles, he’s on track for a career high in the statistic – the most he had was 65 tackles as sophomore.
Mays faces stiff competition on both lists, however. Tennessee’s Eric Berry is on both lists, though he too has struggled with producing gaudy stats this year.
