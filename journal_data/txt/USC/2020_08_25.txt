On Aug. 11, the Pac-12 made the decision to cancel its fall football season. Although this was likely the safest choice considering the continued spread of the coronavirus across the United States, it speaks to the lack of input that student-athletes have in NCAA sports.
Both the Pac-12 and the Big Ten (the other Power Five conference to cancel its football season) had brought their players back to member schools’ campuses for summer workouts and had even released 10-game conference schedules set to begin in mid-September.
Though the Pac-12 conference released its altered football schedule July 31, it backtracked and suddenly canceled the season Aug. 11. There was no drastic change in the country’s health situation within that period, rendering the timing of the decision dubious.
Rather, the relevant change came Aug. 2, when Pac-12 players organized the #WeAreUnited movement. It was created to ensure the conference would protect players’ health throughout the season, as up until that point it had failed to create and implement a comprehensive coronavirus safety plan.
Although the movement was focused on securing adequate health and safety protections, it also made requests for social justice measures which would be partially funded by 2% of the conference’s annual revenue. Furthermore, players demanded that 50% of each sport’s conference revenue be divided among the athletes and the ability to profit off their likeness.
If these requests were left unmet, some players were prepared to boycott the season. Rather than attempt to work with the players to at least meet some of their demands, the Pac-12 pulled the plug on its season. The decision was made without any input from or consultation with the players, who are the ones putting themselves at risk. Only a mere basic respect for athletes’ rights is required to believe they should have an input in the decision.
The conference was happy to overextend its players by having them practice throughout the summer for a season that was poorly planned. While the players were working hard, conference officials did little to prepare for a football season in the coronavirus era. It is a testament to the reality that the conference and member schools simply wanted the players ready to produce revenue in case a season could go on and were never legitimately committed to working on shaping a safe and equitable season for their players. For reference, USC Football brought in $50 million of revenue last season. 
This is yet another instance of NCAA athletes being taken advantage of for their earning ability while having no voice in the matter whatsoever — not to mention a complete lack of compensation. In recent years support behind college athletes making money has grown substantially, making this most recent case of negligence by the NCAA especially troubling.
When it looked like this season in particular may have required some form of association or union among the players, the conference shied away and opted to cancel the season. If there were a players’ union in place, it would have likely encouraged negotiations that could potentially lead to a safe, thorough and robust plan to salvage the season and many of these players’ chances at professional careers.
In order to have bargaining power in the future, collegiate athletes in profitable sports must be permitted to form unions which would entail them first becoming employees of their respective schools. Thus, unionizing will end the amateur status of college athletes, which is precisely what the NCAA and universities with large, highly profitable athletic departments do not want. Unionization will give these athletes the ability to negotiate with their universities for rights and privileges as well as profit from their work and play.
Student-athletes put their time and bodies on the line for their institutions, and it is time they are fairly represented and rewarded for their efforts.

Not all bodies are treated or represented equally when it comes to conversations concerning health and well-being. As the so-called Wellness Movement — championed by journalists, influencers and health industry professionals alike — has renewed interest in our holistic health, they have also reinforced a disdain and fear of fatness. 
While body positivity activists have begun leading the way in the fight against fatphobia by raising necessary awareness about the dangers of the criminalization of fatness, they often fail to integrate the problem into broader conversations about identity. What is often forgotten is that, in addition to facilitating a system of oppression in which thin bodies reign supreme, fatphobia is also inherently interwoven with sexism and racism. 
Fatphobia and thin desirability have been long-ingrained in the Western cultural consciousness. According to Sabrina Strings, associate professor of sociology at UC Irvine, the thin feminine aesthetic has permeated the U.S. mainstream since at least the early 19th century, preceding the medical alarms now raised around being overweight. By the late 20th century, concepts of fatness in popular discourse began to shift — now, not only is being overweight seen as undesirable, but also medically concerning.
In the 1950’s, post-World War II pseudoscience began to tie into the condemnation of fatness. Peter Stearns’ book, “Fat History,” explores this phenomenon, in which psychologists and experts suggested that those who were gifted and overweight “did not fulfill the promise of their early achievement.” Additionally, they argued that thinness implied psychological adjustment and that “girls get fat because they’re emotionally disturbed.” 
By the onset of the 21st century, the United States entered the full-blown fatness panic that has largely defined body politics for the past 20 years, its cornerstone being the condemnation of obesity. In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a press release about the obesity epidemic, with former director Jeffrey Koplan stating that “it should be taken as seriously as any infectious disease epidemic.” 
Meanwhile, the prevalence of eating disorders in the United States has since increased, affecting a reported 8 million Americans in 2001 compared to the 30 million cases reported today. While these numbers are likely to have changed in part to the growing pool of knowledge around eating disorders and mental health, many professionals argue that one epidemic may have led to another — in other words, eating disorders became the collateral damage of our war on obesity. 
It’s also critical to keep in mind how the ingrained  preference and desire of the “thin body” is intimately connected to systems of oppression. Demarcating bodies into racialized categories due to skin color had its onset in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, but that became a more challenging method of grouping by the 18th century due to interracial sex. As a result, social stratification began to rely less on skin color and instead included discourse suggesting that Black bodies were voracious and inferior to white, European bodies who could practice restraint and self-control. Body size, among other pseudoscientific claims, was weaponized as a means to reinforce racial superiority. 
Late 19th-century women’s lifestyle magazines — largely targeting middle- and upper-class white women — further constructed the narrative around the danger of the fat, Black person. An article published in 1897 by Harper’s Bazaar titled “The Sorrows of Fat,” explains that not only is “fatness a most undesirable state” but that a fat woman may only be “a social success unless she burntcork herself, don beads, and then go to that burning climate where women, like pigs, are valued at so much a pound.” 
Ultimately, the pre-20th century discriminatory — and arguably eugenicist — discussion concerning body weight laid the framework for the eventual medical concerns raised about obesity and fatness that we see today. 
In 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Black women have the highest rates of obesity or being overweight compared to other groups, per measurement of a Body Mass Index exceeding 25. BMI is largely standardized across the medical communities as a means for assessing physical fitness, measuring the ratio of a person’s weight to their height. However, it does not account for bone density, muscularity or other genetic influences on weight, nor does it consider additional cultural or environmental influences. 
Increased research and advice from medical professionals and scholars has supported that BMI is indeed a poor tool to measure health outcomes and that there are better solutions to tackling health concerns than advising weight-restrictive mandates. As for improving health outcomes across communities, research also indicates that combating systemic issues at play like minimal food accessibility and mental health resources may also bring about more effective solutions.
Studies into fatphobia, its history and its repercussions reveal the often overlooked mechanisms that enable one issue or problem to coincide with and bolster another. It also offers a poignant reminder of our flawed interpretations of wellness as we continue to grapple with a racial reckoning amid the coronavirus pandemic. Along with it, though, comes hope that an improved understanding will help fuel our ensuing fight forward.

Most of the time, Southern California weather is envied for its temperateness and predictability, but this is no longer the case when a heatwave strikes. Thankfully, the Daily Trojan is here to provide sweet relief with recommendations for cold treats in our backyard. Almost every place has a delivery option making it even easier to enjoy your next new craving.
With indoor dining paused, take out is the next best thing. Getting food from a favorite spot and enjoying it at home offers some sense of normalcy. Alternatively, enjoying a meal with others (socially distanced, of course) can be a well-deserved break from isolation. Whether near or far this semester, these establishments will be here to enjoy and are Los Angeles favorites.
USC students are lucky to enjoy a wide variety of dessert places in the city, catering to food lovers of all kinds. Read on whether you are currently in L.A. or hope to be in the future. Your new favorite dessert shop awaits!
La Michoacana Cold Delights
Starting strong, this establishment has the largest selection of treats to choose from and is the closest to campus. The paletas (Mexican ice pops) are made with fresh fruit, and the flavor is immaculate. There are plenty of options for dietary preferences and enough choices that even the pickiest of eaters will find something to enjoy. With affordable prices and proximity to campus, this tucked away shop will soon become your favorite. When planning your visit, opt for streetside parking, and be patient with the lines! Delivery is not available.
Southern Girl Desserts
Cupcakes may not be your first choice for a dessert in the heat, but minds will be changed when paired with authentic Southern sweet tea. This is all thanks to natives of the South, Catarah Coleman and Shoneji Robison, who pride themselves on bringing a slice of the region to L.A. The establishment boasts daily and specialty flavors that are only available certain days of the week. If you are not in Los Angeles, shipping is available nationwide and is becoming a popular option as more people look for ways to support Black-owned businesses. Delivery is available through Postmates and GrubHub. 
Oakobing
Although the coronavirus placed a pause on attending concerts, this was my go-to post-concert treat. Located in Koreatown, this shop specializes in Korean-style shaved ice. Ice flakes come in fruit and dessert flavors, like caramel macchiato. If you opt for the mango melon ice flakes, they are served in a melon. If picking one flavor proves to be too tricky, combinations are allowed and encouraged. The large portions and uniquely refreshing feeling makes it a perfect treat for any hot day. Delivery is available through GrubHub, DoorDash and Uber Eats.
Cocobella Creamery
All of your ice cream needs will be covered with a visit here. Cocobella Creamery boasts an impressive lineup of cups, cones, sundaes, ice cream sandwiches, floats and ice cream cake. The flavors are all vegan and gluten-free with coconut or oat milk bases. This establishment opens a whole new door for those who are allergic to dairy or lactose intolerant, all while doing so with exciting flavors such as Horchata, Kinda Baked and Coconut Caramel Macchiato. Delivery is available through Postmates.
Happy Ice
Let’s get one thing clear: Happy Ice is not a snow cone shop. The establishment turns water into the consistency of ice cream with a sorbet flavor, which can’t fully be explained but must be experienced. If the name rings a bell, Happy Ice gained fame after an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where a couple gave free Happy Ice to community members to bring joy and pay it forward after DeGeneres gave them money in their time of need. Happy Ice is a Black-owned local business and delivery is available through GrubHub and Uber Eats.
FROG Frozen Yogurt Bar
What’s more Hollywood than a one-word eatery whose contents cannot be determined through the name alone? This recommendation is a personal favorite as it is within walking distance from the iconic (now closed) Amoeba Music. It’s well worth the drive, from the light-up ceilings to the full range of unique flavors. There are vegan yogurt options and toppings beyond what you’d find at a standard frozen yogurt place. The flavors include apple cinnamon strudel and root beer float and can be topped with lychee or watermelon. The outside of the building is bright pink, so it’s unmissable while driving! Delivery is available through Uber Eats and GrubHub.

Let’s face it, weekends in college are not what they used to be. With the student body scattered to the four winds this semester, the typical atmosphere of door-to-door frat parties, late-night food runs with friends on Fig and Downtown L.A. day trips has become a faint recollection. (Although some people seem to be having a hard time letting go of the past when it comes to off-campus ragers.)
As the second week of classes begins, those who have moved back to Los Angeles are likely looking to fill the void. So for those itching to escape the confines of their apartments and get some fresh air, here is a list of socially distant sights and hiking trails to explore in and around the city. 
Sights 
The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens 
For those looking to break away from their screens, a trip to The Huntington is perfect for clearing the mental clutter after a long week of online classes. 
Established in 1919 by Henry E. Huntington and his wife Arabella, The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens is a collections-based research and educational institution located just 30 minutes from campus in the quiet suburbs of San Marino. 
Due to the coronavirus, the indoor galleries and some high-touch outdoor areas — including the Children’s Garden and the Conservatory — remain closed. However, The Huntington boasts 14 other themed gardens spread out over an astounding 120 acres that are a treat to visit any time of year. With nearly 15,000 different plants, the grounds are bursting with flowers, herbs and foliage of every imaginable color and scent. 
While picnics are not permitted, consider swinging by the 1919 Café for grab-and-go refreshments that you can enjoy while strolling through the grounds. 
Whether you’re a photographer, artist, architecture student or looking to practice mindfulness, a visit to The Huntington Gardens is one of the best ways to experience L.A. while maintaining social distancing. 
Marvin Braude Bike Trail 
For the environmentally conscious Trojans out there, a bike ride along the Marvin Braude Bike Trail — also known as The Strand — is the ideal way to get a taste for the various beach towns dotting the L.A. coastline. Starting at Will Rogers State Beach in the Pacific Palisades, The Strand passes through popular Southern California destinations, including Santa Monica, Venice and Dockweiler (to name a few) before ending at Torrance Beach. 
Some weekend warriors enjoy biking the entire 21-mile beach path in a single day, but I’d recommend starting small for your first time on The Strand. A popular choice is the stretch from Manhattan Beach to Hermosa Beach. This mile-and-a-half route is ideal around sunset so that when you reach the famous Hermosa Beach Pier, you can watch the sun dip below the horizon. 
If you’re a movie buff, you’ll recognize that this pier and the famous Lighthouse Café behind it are featured in “La La Land.” For bonus points and an added layer of fun, pop in some headphones and listen to the movie soundtrack as you and your friends ride back down the bike path. 
Hikes 
Waterman Mountain Loop Trail 
If you’re looking to leave the city bubble and get out into nature, consider a hike along the Waterman Mountain Loop Trail. Located in the Angeles National Forest, a little more than an hour’s drive from campus, this six-mile-long, moderately rated route features stunning alpine views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Massive pine and cedar trees line the trail providing shade and an intoxicating aroma can be enjoyed even through face masks. 
Once you reach the summit, you’ll find plenty of striking boulder formations — a good place to rest, have lunch and take in the quiet landscape. Foot traffic on the wide trails is light and these rocky outcrops can be great places to practice meditation and breathing exercises alone, with your quarantine pod or alongside a few socially distanced friends. 
Musch Trail to Eagle Rock 
Another day hike option is Musch Trail to Eagle Rock. About a 40-minute drive from campus, the 4.5-mile-long trail is located in the middle of Topanga Canyon. You’ll be treated to bohemian roadside art installations reminiscent of 1970s counterculture along the journey to the trailhead. 
Whether you’re a hiker, trail runner, bird watcher or flower enthusiast, this trail has enough variety to satisfy any outdoorsman’s needs. The landscape frequently changes on the hike, from tree tunnels to vast grass fields, and includes several creek crossings. One section of the trail is a dead ringer for the alpine meadow in the opening scene of “The Sound of Music” — you’ll almost expect to see Julie Andrews twirling around in the wildflowers when you walk through it. 
While Musch Trail often has heavier foot traffic than the Waterman Mountain Loop Trail, there are large footpath sections that are wide enough to maintain social distance when passing others. The first half of the trail is pretty flat and gradually gets steeper with a pretty serious incline the last mile or so, but the final push up the hill is more than worth it when you see the far-out rock formations. If you aren’t afraid of heights, climb to the top of the sloping rocks and take in the Pacific Ocean’s 180-degree view. 
Musch Trail to Eagle Rock is bound to make for an exciting weekend adventure from the strange art to the otherworldly rock formations at the end of the hike. 
Backbone Trail to Corral Canyon Road 
Located in the Santa Monica Mountains, less than an hour from campus, Backbone Trail is another essential L.A. hike. The 63-mile-long trail is best made for weekend trips in smaller sections; one popular choice is a trek from Backbone Trail up to Corral Canyon Road. 
The steep incline for the last half of the hike will definitely get your blood pumping and can be difficult for some when wearing face masks, but the views of Malibu Canyon from the top are good compensation, as are the wildflowers and other native flora that line the trail on your way up. If you take the trail to Castro Crest, you’ll also find an unusual spiral rock art formation on the ground maintained by hikers over the years.
