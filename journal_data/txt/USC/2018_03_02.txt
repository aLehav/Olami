A 5-foot-11, 160-pound kid from Etiwanda, Calif. arrived at USC in 2014, when the men’s basketball program was at rock bottom.

“They’re an up-and-coming program,” the young point guard told ESPN after choosing the Trojans over more established powerhouses like UCLA, Kansas and Indiana. “They told me they would bring No. 11 out of retirement so I could wear it during my Trojan career.” 
With 4,060 minutes played, 1,556 points scored and 685 assists dished out, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin is now nearing the end of his college career. And his No. 11 jersey, previously retired for Bill Sharman (who played at USC from 1946-50), will soon return to the rafters never to be worn again — this time, permanently. 
Saturday’s game against UCLA marks McLaughlin’s final hurrah at the Galen Center. 
“I keep thinking about it, but it probably won’t hit me until I’m there,” McLaughlin said. “But it’s a bittersweet moment. I’ve had some really good times here.”
When a player of McLaughlin’s caliber and impact concludes his/her collegiate career, it feels like the end of an era. McLaughlin arrived when USC basketball was considered more of a joke than a Pac-12 contender (as the Trojans will be when the conference tournament begins next week). USC finished dead last in the Pac-12 with a paltry 2-16 conference record the year before he joined the team. In the aftermath of a crippling NCAA scandal involving star player OJ Mayo, USC hadn’t recorded a winning record or made it to the NCAA Tournament since the 2010-11 season. 
McLaughlin was supposed to change the culture of USC hoops, and he accomplished that mission with aplomb. He’s led the Trojans to three-straight 20-win seasons and two consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. With a strong showing in the UCLA game and the upcoming Pac-12 Championship, he can help his team punch its ticket to a third-straight Big Dance — marking only the second three-peat in school history. 
But his legacy on the court is equally important as his legacy off of it. For the past four years, McLaughlin has been the face of USC basketball. He’s walked around Galen like the mayor, greeting everyone he encounters. 
“I talk to all the ushers that work the games,” McLaughlin said. “I’ve built strong relationships with them, DJ Mal-Ski, going around shaking hands with the fans after the games is big. It’s everything that goes into Galen … [there are] a lot of relationships I’ve built on and off the court.”
Over the course of his career, there have also been plenty of special moments on the court. Most notably, when he tied the Pac-12 single-game assists record with 19 against UC Santa Barbara in December. Or when he nailed two half-court buzzer-beaters against Cal and Arizona State in 2017. And who could forget when he led the Trojans to an upset victory over the Lonzo Ball-led UCLA Bruins at Galen Center last year? 
“When we played [UCLA] here my junior year it was pretty fun,” McLaughlin said. “We had a blackout game and we won pretty big … It’s always a good game competing against them and the rivalry speaks for itself.” 
On Saturday, he has one final chance to dazzle the Galen Center crowd and one final chance to defeat crosstown rival UCLA (unless they meet again in the Pac-12 Tournament).
Entering last year’s home game against the Bruins, McLaughlin led the Trojans off to an impressive start but the team remained untested. This time, both teams carry similar records (UCLA is 19-10, while USC is 21-9), and are each vying for a Tournament spot in March. 
With improper benefit allegations swirling around USC again (according to a Yahoo Sports report, junior forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright may have received cash from sports agency ASM) a win over UCLA can redeem a season full of turmoil. It makes sense that for McLaughlin, whose clutch performances have anchored USC for four years, his final home game is also his most pivotal to date. 
“It’s very fitting,” McLaughlin said. “It’s a rivalry game … We’re on the bubble, we need a win and we’re also right there competing for a Pac-12 Championship still. It’s very big and for it to be against UCLA, it’s even bigger.” 
During his time at USC, McLaughlin changed the program’s culture, turning a perennial laughingstock into a consistent winner, but the future of USC men’s basketball is cloudy. With a pending FBI investigation and possible NCAA sanctions on the horizon, his career has been bookended by scandal.
Still, he believes he’s left the program in a better place than where he found it back in 2014 as a wide-eyed recruit straight from Etiwanda, Calif.
“I hope [I’ve improved USC basketball],” McLaughlin said. “And in everybody else’s eyes, I hope [I have]. I’ve done all I can for this program. I’ve left everything out there on the court.”
Both McLaughlin and the program’s futures are uncertain, but one thing is guaranteed; on Saturday he will leave everything out on the Galen Center court one last time.

The 2017-2018 season for USC basketball has been nothing but noise. 
Junior forward Chimezie Metu goes up for a dunk against Oregon State. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
Whether it was the initial scandal involving former assistant coach Tony Bland, sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton’s suspension or even recent reports claiming that junior forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright also took illegal benefits, everything surrounding the program has painted this year as a season of chaos.
This Saturday, however, USC has the chance to do what they have done for a majority of this season: silence the noise. 
“It’s been a challenging season for all of us,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “It wears on all of us because you feel for people. We’re a big family here and when someone from your family has something going on, you care for each other.” 
Despite the off-the-court negativity, USC sits in second place in the Pac-12 and its 12-5 start to conference play is its best since 1997.
Along with winning 10 of its last 13 games, USC has won 20 or more games for the third consecutive season, just the second time in school history (2007-09). 
And although UCLA leads the all-time series 141-108, USC is 4-3 in its last seven games against UCLA, including the last two wins at the Galen Center.
But the last time the Bruins and Trojans faced off, the story did not end happily for USC.
Just one month ago at Pauley Pavilion, and despite holding a 69-60 lead with 8:08 left in the second half, USC fell to UCLA 82-79  after a combination of clutch second-half plays from junior point guard Aaron Holiday as well as the Bruin bigs. 
Along with 10 points from Holiday, UCLA tallied 22 points in the final eight minutes thanks to 3-point buckets and free-throws from seniors center Thomas Welsh and forward G.G. Goloman. 
Holiday, who hit two 3-pointers late, led all scorers with 23 points and added nine assists, a steal, a block and six rebounds.
The rest of the Bruins combined for 12-for-26 shooting from deep downtown (46.2 percent) and drained 29 of their 57 shots from the field (50.9 percent). 
And while Metu (11 points, 12 rebounds) and sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic (14 points, 10 rebounds) both achieved double-doubles, the Trojans scoring attack featured streaky shooting.
Usually reliable, Boatwright and freshman guard Jordan Usher went for a combined 0-for-9 from the field in 20 minutes of play. 
Since USC and UCLA’s road trips to Arizona, the Trojans have excelled while the Bruins have faltered. 
Despite losing Boatwright to a season-ending knee injury, USC has won four-straight over Oregon, Oregon State, Colorado and Utah. 
“We’re definitely a different team, because we’ve gotten better every game,” Metu said. “One thing we’ve learned is that we’ve got to play better defense. Guys went away from it for a while and now we’ve locked back in.” 
Just like USC, UCLA also swept the Oregon schools with a 75-68 win over Oregon State and an 86-78 overtime win over Oregon.
While their success was evident against Oregon and Oregon State, the Bruins dropped two-straight to the Utah Utes (84-78) and Colorado Buffaloes (80-76).
For a USC squad that completed its first Mountain road trip sweep since Utah and Colorado joined the Pac-12 in 2011, Saturday night’s matchup could add momentum to this streaking Trojan team.
After a three-game losing stretch of 80 points or more allowed on defense, USC in its four-game winning streak has allowed just 62.75 points per game. 
The defense for the Trojans has been a key to their recent success. 
“Our focus is on the defensive end,” Enfield said. “We’ve played excellent defense the past few games, it has to continue because UCLA is extremely explosive on offense and can put points on the board in a hurry. They have five guys on the court that can score at any time, so we’re going to have our hands full.” 
But Saturday’s game means more for USC than just a rivalry game and a chance to cement itself as the second-best team in the Pac-12. 
For senior guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, it could mean a chance to cement themselves in USC history. 
Along with ranking third in the nation in assists (228), McLaughlin ranks second on USC’s all-time list in minutes played, only nine minutes behind the all-time leader Dwight Lewis.
If McLaughlin plays for 10 minutes against UCLA — which he certainly should, considering he has averaged 34.5 minutes per game this season — he will have played in over 4,070 minutes in the Trojan uniform. 
“We’ve built a culture here that’s a winning program,” McLaughlin said. “It’s been a great experience here at USC, I’ve built a lot of relationships on and off the court. It’s bittersweet, but coming up against UCLA, I’ve got to go out with a bang.”
Meanwhile, Stewart has played 132 career games as a Trojan, second on USC’s all-time list behind Dwight Lewis who leads with 133.
Having already achieved USC’s three-point record last game with his 234th three ball, Stewart could share the title for most games played with Lewis at 133 on Saturday night. 
Even with these records being broken, the Trojans first have to take down a hungry UCLA squad that hasn’t won at the Galen Center in over three years.

The Pac-12 women’s basketball tournament began yesterday in Seattle as four first-round games tipped off throughout Thursday. The 7th-seed USC faced off against 10th-seed Washington State and edged out the Cougars 47-44 in a tight, low-scoring contest.
Senior forward Kristen Simon recorded 8 points and 11 rebounds on Thursday. Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
Both teams came out with tough defense as USC forced four Washington State turnovers in the first five minutes while Washington State limited USC to just 2-for-9 shooting as the Cougars took an early 6-4 lead. By the end of the quarter, the Cougars led just 7-6 over the Trojans as both teams had trouble putting the ball in the basket.
The Trojans went on an 8-2 run in the second period to go ahead 16-12 and would settle with an 18-16 lead at halftime; USC’s junior guard Aliyah Mazyck led all scorers with 10 points in the first half.
“I think we just gotta be patient,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We’re not taking good shots, we’re forcing a lot of shots and our shot selection just needs to get a lot better.”
Washington State took back the lead on a 6-2 early run and later led 27-24 following a Louise Brown 3-pointer. However, the Trojans would storm back to take the lead on the heels of a 9-0 run and solid defense. The Trojans would lead 35-31 at the end of the 3rd period.
Despite losing the lead briefly to the Cougars, the Trojans would control and lead 39-36 to start the 4th. They would take a 6-point lead following freshman guard Minyon Moore’s pull-up 3-pointer, but the Cougars would cut the lead back down to 3. In crunch time, senior guard Sadie Edwards split her free throws to put the Trojans up 4. But on the other end, Nike McClure capitalized on an and-1 opportunity to cut the Trojans’ lead down to 45-44. Edwards would miss a baseline jumper with seven seconds left but Kristen Simon secured the offensive rebound before getting fouled with two seconds. The Trojans would score a layup to end the game with a 47-44 victory over the Cougars.
“It’s defense, we played great defense,” Trakh said. “I think [Edwards] did a nice job, [Mazyck], [Simon], [Moore] was big down the stretch so I think it was just, everybody played defense tonight, it was great. This is our 20th win, I don’t care if we’re playing the Golden State Warriors tomorrow, we’re gonna have fun!”
Moore and Mazyck led the Trojans with 16 and 14 points, respectively. While the team struggled shooting from the floor with a 31 percent shooting rate, the team played great defense. Simon led the team in rebounds with 12, including the critical offensive rebound that sealed the game for USC. USC outrebounded Washington State 40-32, including 14-7 on the offensive glass.
“When the going got tough, we were just saying: ‘stick together, keep playing our game,’” Moore said.
On Friday, the Trojans face off against 2nd-seeded Stanford at 6 p.m. in the quarterfinals. On two previous occasions, the Stanford Cardinal defeated the Trojans in close affairs as they beat the Trojans 72-65 on New Year’s Eve and edged them out again 59-55 on Jan. 19.
“Honestly, every game that we played with Stanford has been a close game,” Moore said. “Both teams play great, top players showed out and honestly it’s going to be a great game.”
The game will be streamed on Pac-12 Networks as the Trojans play the Cardinal at 6 p.m.

Depending on your perspective, the men’s basketball game this weekend can mean everything or nothing. Who could’ve known at the start of this season — with an FBI scandal hanging over the program before the first game even tipped off — that USC would be in a position to potentially earn a share of the regular season Pac-12 title?
Even if that doesn’t materialize, the squad has still clinched its best-ever finish in the Pac-12 under head coach Andy Enfield. The feat would be even sweeter coming with a win over UCLA, and it would be a poetic way to confirm the Trojans’ rise over the last few years from conference punching bag to national force. A victory would mean everything.
Then again, this game has little bearing on USC’s spot in the NCAA tournament. Sure, one last W to end the regular season may clinch a ticket to the Big Dance, but a loss won’t bury the Trojans with a second bite at the cherry waiting at the conference tourney in Las Vegas next week. In that sense, this game means almost nothing.
Maybe you’re the ultimate pessimist and see the hammer of the law (or NCAA) coming down onto Heritage Hall in the near future. I can’t blame you for being paranoid — it’s not often we see this much smoke and find out there’s no fire — and if you assume that any wins from this season will ultimately not count, then in your eyes, this game really means nothing.
But let’s think happy thoughts and buy into the symbolism of the moment (it’s hard to write a column about a meaningless game). When USC lost in Westwood last month, it kicked off a three-game skid that many feared would prove deadly come March. A strong response has put such doubts to rest. The Trojans will clinch the second seed in the Pac-12 tournament with a win in Saturday’s crosstown showdown.
Beyond that, the team also has the opportunity to set the record straight after blowing a double-digit lead in its defeat at UCLA. Had the Trojans hung on to win at Pauley Pavilion, they would have already locked up the second seed this week and would have been fighting for a possible outright regular-season conference title. Regardless of how much turmoil it is in, Arizona is unlikely to lose to last-place Cal, so this is probably a moot point; nevertheless, it has to irk the Trojans that they are not considered the clearly superior team in Los Angeles, despite hanging near the Pac-12 summit all season while the Bruins currently sit in fourth.
The perception might be different if USC had put last month’s game away. Saturday presents a chance to correct that mistake — to remind everyone that the Trojans have owned their archrivals at the Galen Center in recent years, with their last home loss against the Bruins coming in early 2015.
Of course, you can never assume victory against UCLA. USC has only recently shed its perennial underdog label in the crosstown rivalry, and it would be both silly and dangerous to get so cocky so quickly. The Bruins may be coming off back-to-back losses against Utah and Colorado (the two teams USC has most recently defeated), but they also come from victories over Kentucky and Arizona this season. You don’t luck into beating both of those squads: UCLA can top anyone on its day.
So can the Trojans, though. A strength of schedule higher than the likes of No. 7 Gonzaga and No. 12 Texas Tech, plus a win versus a strong Middle Tennessee squad are testaments to that fact. Returning to its fortress riding a four-game winning streak, USC has every reason to be confident and no reason to be complacent heading into the regular-season finale.
The Trojans may lose — such is the nature of rivalry games — but if they do, fans can safely fall back on the pragmatist’s argument: This game will prove irrelevant with a strong showing in the Pac-12 Tournament next week.
Still, no matter how indifferent you may be about Saturday’s game, it can’t truly mean nothing. We’re talking about a tilt against the Bruins here. Even if it makes no practical impact on the Trojans’ postseason resume, a victory against UCLA would still be something to be savored — and a vacated win still trumps a loss.

The USC baseball team will look to extend its seven-game winning streak this weekend as they face the fifth-ranked Arkansas Razorbacks at Baum Stadium. This looks to be the toughest opponent the Trojans have faced this season.
Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
After an opening day loss to Utah Valley, the Trojans have managed to grind out victories, holding a 7-1 record this season. Despite their record, the wins haven’t come easily for the Trojans. Just recently, they squeaked past a 1-6 Loyola Marymount team late in the eighth inning thanks to a solo shot by junior shortstop Chase Bushor to win 3-2. Additionally, the Trojans have had a few games this season where they have had more runs than hits.
The team has not played the “sexiest” baseball by any means, but they have managed to win games because they have been exceptional at basic aspects of the game. 
For example, the Trojans have been focused on defense so far this season, making virtually every play they could have made. In fact, according to the NCAA, the Trojans lead the nation in fielding percentage, .997, with only one error in their first eight games.
“The defense has been fantastic,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “They make the routine play. They made balls on the run, balls in the hole, we’re not killing ourselves with stupid mistakes. And that’s what we’re going to have to do. This team is going to be built on pitching and defense and our bullpen and then getting the timely hit. I think we’ve been successful at doing that for the first couple of weeks.”
Despite posting a .276 team batting average on the season, which ranks 92nd in the nation according to the NCAA, the Trojans have managed to score runs because they still get their runners on base and into scoring positions, even if it isn’t through hits. 
The Trojans have been walked 51 times this year, boosting their on-base percentage to an impressive .407. Furthermore, the Trojans have done an excellent job of converting runs with runners in scoring positions which has helped them grind out victories.
The bullpen has also played its part for the Trojans this season. Sophomore pitcher Connor Lunn and redshirt junior pitcher Brad Wegman have both looked great this season as relievers. Lunn has four saves on five appearances this season with eight strikeouts and one hit. 
Similarly, Wegman has only allowed one hit in six appearances this season, striking out five batters in the process. Both pitchers have yet to allow a run in over 12.1 innings pitched between them.
However, this series against the Razorbacks will be the first real test for the Trojans. The No. 5 Razorbacks hold a 6-2 record, having recently lost to Cal Poly and the University of San Diego over the weekend. Despite their recent losses, the Razorbacks only dropped one spot in this week’s NCAA ranking. The experts still believe they have one of the most talented rosters — and pitching staffs — in the nation, and because they have obliterated some of their opposition.
In just their second game, Arkansas beat Bucknell by a resounding score of 32-4. On Wednesday night, the Razorbacks crushed the Dayton Flyers 18-1. Arkansas can win games with ease against opponents that show them any kind of weakness.
With a combined ERA of 1.58 and multiple pitchers that throw upwards of 90 mph, Arkansas has one of the best pitching rotations in the NCAA. According to SBNation, junior pitcher Blaine Knight has thrown pitches as fast as 97 mph.
Despite this, Hubbs said he was confident in USC’s ability on the field.
“I think it will be a big challenge for us,” Hubbs said. “Obviously, we feel like it’s probably going to be the best team we’ve played up until this point. It’s a hostile environment, they get a ton of fans. It’s a great postseason-type atmosphere, so I’m excited to see how the guys respond to it. I know this: if I was one of the players, I would be more than excited going out there and getting the chance to face a top five team in the country at their place in front of a bunch of people.”
After their series against the Razorbacks, the Trojans will prepare to face three more ranked opponents in the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic next weekend. The Trojans will play both TCU and Vanderbilt at Dedeaux Field and will then close against UCLA at Dodger Stadium.

As is the case most years, USC football will be well represented not only when draft day comes in late April, but also this weekend at the Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.

After sending eight athletes to the NFL Combine last year, USC will have six former players working out in front of scouts through the weekend at Lucas Oil Stadium. Included among those in attendance are quarterback Sam Darnold, wide receivers Steven Mitchell Jr. and Deontay Burnett, running back Ronald Jones II, linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and defensive lineman Rasheem Green.
Like when he was playing in cardinal and gold, Darnold will certainly command most of the attention out of the Trojan draft prospects this weekend, if not the entire group of prospects working out in Indianapolis. In fact, he has already made headlines without performing a single workout due to his announcement Tuesday that he would not be throwing throughout the weekend.
Although all the other top quarterback prospects such as Wyoming’s Josh Allen, UCLA’s Josh Rosen and former Oklahoma Sooner Baker Mayfield will be throwing in this year’s combine, there is precedent for Darnold’s decision. In 2014, both Teddy Bridgewater and Johnny Manziel elected to wait, as Darnold is, until their pro day workout to throw passes in front of scouts. Clearly, it didn’t hurt their draft stock too drastically as both would go on to be first-round picks in the ensuing draft.
Beyond the 2017 Rose Bowl MVP, the balance of the USC contingency will have a lot to prove in front of the NFL scouts this weekend.  According to his most recent mock draft, Bleacher Report’s Matt Miller has Darnold as his top pick while the rest of the Trojan combine invitees are listed as being drafted outside of the first round.
Jones II, the Pac-12’s second leading rusher from this past season, is projected to go off the board early in the second round while Nwosu, a USC defensive captain who tied for 10th in the FBS in sacks, is expected to hear his name called later in the second round. Furthermore, co-sacks leader Green is projected to be an early third-round pick in Miller’s projections.
No two players have as much to prove heading into this weekend as Trojan wideouts Burnett and  Mitchell Jr., as they are expected to be fifth-round and undrafted prospects, respectively.  Putting up an impressive stat-line of 86 catches for 1,114 yards and nine scores in 2017, Burnett finished the season in the top three among Pac-12 receivers and well within the top-20 nationally.
For Mitchell Jr., he will have to work hard to convince scouts that a track record of injury will not impact his NFL value. Never topping 650 yards in any of his four seasons at Southern Cal, Mitchell Jr. suffered a major knee injury in his 2016 campaign that cut his season short at seven games and proved to limit his snaps at times this past season.
A year ago, USC similarly sent two receivers to the scouting combine: Juju Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers. The former was selected in the second round while the latter ended up not being drafted.
Jones II will work out on Friday while Darnold, Mitchell Jr. and Burnett will perform on Saturday, and Green and Nwosu will check in on Sunday.
