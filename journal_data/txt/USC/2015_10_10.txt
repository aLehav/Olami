First things first, I’m the realest. Just kidding. I mean, I am the realest, but that’s not where I’m headed. I need to start this review with a heartbreaking disclaimer: Between 49 different coffee shops and innumerable revisits, I’m starting to feel like I am extremely close to hitting my lifetime quota of vanilla lattes.
Not only am I starting to dislike both the vanilla and latte aspects of the once infallible drink, but the distinctions between each shops drinks are also slowly blending together, and very few flavored lattes can be distinguished from the last. This does not mean, however, that #JackieLikesJava is coming to a close! On the contrary, this just means I need to expand my espresso horizons and find a new standard of comparison.
Way, way, way before this devastating goodbye to the Vanillatte (no one calls them that, but I feel like I’ve said “vanilla latte” far too many times already), I went to two different Alfred Coffee locations to see if their hype was well-deserved.
Alfred Coffee has adopted three similar and unnecessarily distinct brands. We have the {Coffee & Kitchen} (they put curly braces around each location for some reason — I personally don’t get it, but it’s cute) one that sits on Melrose Place and that I have never been to on account of parking being muddled by the cars of the rich that cost more than two years at USC. Location Pro Tip: Boyband members and YouTube beauty gurus tend to favor this Alfred as their go-to.
Next in the Alfred line-up is the {In The Alley} edition. Hooray for me, I’ve been here! Surprise — it’s in an alley. Truly shocking. Anyway, parking sucks. It’s metered street parking, so sharpen up on those parallel parking skills and stock up on those quarters, fam.
Beyond that, the actual storefront might actually be one of the most stereotypically Los Angeles things I’ve ever experienced. Wooden plank benches made to look natural, black and white tiles, neon signs, Pressed Juicery and gold accents at every turn. I felt the Instagram Aesthetic Gods shine their light on me. This location is Wi-Fi friendly (though spotty) and the baristas are some of the nicest I’ve met. It’s pretty obvious that this is a popular place and the line they had at the door only supported that. However, they process orders very quickly and are super accommodating to those who need a recommendation. Location Pro Tip: Get a free iced coffee with a check in on Yelp!

The third Alfred location is the {Brentwood} version. This one is also highly Instagrammable and, dare I say it, the parking situation is not that bad. They don’t have Wi-Fi at all here, so I do not recommend it for work. Instead, treat it as a bougie hangout for you to bring your mom to for Mother’s Day or something. My group had a rough time finding a spot here, as it’s one of the most popular coffee spots in the immediate area and there are only a couple tables available, but there’s a pretty decent turnaround for freeing them up. Location Pro Tip: The interior is small and not as photogenic as their famous “But first, Coffee” cups.

In the most predictable of scenarios, I ordered vanilla lattes at the Alfred’s locations I visited. They were both pretty standard. Amazing at the time, yet forgettable in retrospect. Perhaps we can attribute this hype-less encounter to my diluted palate. Sigh. I tried really hard to fall in love with Alfred, but it just wasn’t happening. Nevertheless, their other menu items seem promising. From affogatos to espresso cones (a shot of espresso in a tiny lil chocolate ice cream cone) to the $10 Latte (a full bottle of Pressed Juicery’s chocolate or vanilla flavored almond milk with a shot of espresso over ice, which actually sounds really good right about now), there’s something for everyone. In fact, I think I might just venture into {Coffee & Kitchen} to try something new.

Our love of music often stems from the brilliance of song lyrics. From Taylor Swift’s witty, romantic lines to John Mayer’s deeply moving verses, lyrics make up the heart of the song, building meaning while digging wells of emotion. 
Since lyrics are so critical to a song, listeners could be left hanging with lines that deal with more abstract matters. In those cases, delving deeper can help draw treasure troves of poetic meaning. One great example of this is “Drops of Jupiter” by Train, a song that employs sweeping symbols and extended metaphors about space while even managing to add deep-fried chicken to the mix. 
The whole song is built around a celestial theme. Many of the lyrics are bizarre enough to be literally out of this world. At one point, Train croons, “Now that she’s back in my atmosphere, with drops of Jupiter in her hair.”  The idea of “drops of jupiter” is a highly abstract concept that in itself doesn’t really make sense at first. These outlandish phrases, however, come together later in the song with the chorus. The following lines, “And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star, one without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?” provide a much deeper understanding to the somewhat confusing metaphor in the verses. 
The song uses celestial imagery to expand on the metaphor that the main female of the song is looking for something out in the world, but to the singer, it seems as though she transcends the galaxy. The speaker takes on a slight melancholy tone when he sings, “Did you fall for a shooting star, without a permanent scar?” Yet, when the woman returns to the singer, she has the remnants of the world out there still with her –– in other words, the “drops of Jupiter.” This could indicate her inability to fully leave behind the adventure she embarked on even while she was trying to find herself outside of her relationship with the singer. 
The line, “She listens like spring and she talks like June,” also draws interesting analogies. Spring is often associated with new beginnings, beautiful weather and blooming flowers. June, as a summer month, could be associated with the warmth and carefree feelings that come with summer. By using these two seasons to describe his love, the artist paints a vivid image of her with multiple dimensions. 
There is also a line that delves into Greek mythology. “So tell me, do you sail across the sun?” could be an allusion to the story of Icarus, the wax-winged boy who flew too close to the sun. His wings melted and he fell to his death, a tragic touch that reflects the singer’s feelings towards his love’s decision to depart and find herself. Perhaps she made another mistake in love and got “burned” by that person, flying too close to the sun. 
Going even deeper into the song, the singer brings up “told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land,” an interesting stray from the lover aspect of the song. In fact it represents a parallel to the girl in his story, saying that she was afraid that she was going to end up like the man too cowardly to fly. Since he was too afraid to ever take off, he could never find his adventure or who he was supposed to be while on the other hand, she flew too high and burned — perhaps by the shooting star she fell for. 
In the second verse, the singer also brings up how the girl “listens to Mozart while she does tae-bo” which, on a surface level, seems like a bizarre description to attribute to someone. This is a key line, however, brings yet again a more humanistic aspect to the singer’s love. Through this line we see her as someone interesting, quirky and very, very human, ironic because there are times when this gal with drops of Jupiter in her hair is also seemingly otherworldly. 
The above is only one interpretation of this song, but it definitely shows the range of possible meanings that abstract and seemingly confusing song lyrics can take on. Artists like Train, John Mayer and many others are known to use metaphors and allegories that might seem strange in the world of bubblegum pop music. Looking beyond the surface, however, it is those seemingly misfit lines that are truly testaments to the artist’s breadth of creativity and talent.
