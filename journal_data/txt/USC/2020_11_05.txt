Alex Eaton is part of a handful of USC students who have been taking in-person classes all semester. But Eaton, a sophomore in the World Bachelor of Business program, isn’t in Los Angeles. The program allows students to study on three different campuses and earn three different degrees, and with some reports recording as low as five new positive coronavirus cases per day in Hong Kong, Eaton and some of his classmates headed there to begin their second year in person. 
Some students have been able to take in person or hybrid classes at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and at Bocconi University, Italy. However, others in the program have remained online instead of being at USC, where they had hoped to initiate their educational journey around the world. First year students have their first year at USC, second year in Hong Kong, third year in Milan and can spend their fourth year at one of the three universities of their choice. 
Eaton was among the students who were able to start optional in-person classes in Hong Kong. He said he was initially concerned he might not be able to reach Hong Kong because of strict coronavirus regulations. With the United States being categorized as a high-risk country, his cohort was only allowed to enter because they were enrolled as full-time students at HKUST. 
The travel process involved a number of precautionary steps to mitigate a potential coronavirus spread. Eaton first flew from his home in Atlanta to L.A. to get tested at USC at the start of the semester to prove he was negative for the virus at least 72 hours before his flight to Hong Kong. Once Eaton arrived in Hong Kong, he waited 14 hours for another test and when it came back negative, he was transported to a hotel for a two-week quarantine. 
“They literally put a bracelet on our wrist to make sure that we weren’t leaving the hotel room,” Eaton said. “We literally could have no contact with anyone like physical contact, doors closed all the time, they dropped food off three times a day, we didn’t get a choice what we ate.”
Once his quarantine was completed, Eaton was allowed to venture into the city. He said Hong Kong was highly regulated with gatherings limited to four people and mask wearing strictly enforced. While initially nervous about exploring the city, Eaton has now had the chance to visit many parts of the city without having to worry about crowds or tourists.
HKUST has also given students flexibility to take either in-person or online classes with many students opting for online classes while living in Hong Kong. Eaton has been regularly attending in-person classes as long as capacity has not been reached. Masks are required during lectures, and socially distanced seats or plexiglass dividers are used to separate students in the classroom. 
“I think the hybrid’s just strange because you have the people on Zoom at the same time, it’s like the participation between Zoom and in class is just something different to adjust to,” Eaton said. “In one of my classes we have a robot where the teacher has some sort of remote on him and the camera will swivel and follow him as he moves. So the online people kind of still get the same experience of being in the classroom.”
Olamide Babayeju, a freshman in WBB, expected to spend time traveling and learning about other cultures throughout her college experience in the program, but the coronavirus pandemic has halted some of those plans for her and her classmates. Babayeju started her college career online because USC moved online this semester. She decided to pursue the World Bachelor in Business because she spent her time watching travel videos on YouTube and was interested in learning about other people’s cultures as well as business practices.
Although she is disappointed that she started online, Babayeju is grateful for the support offered by her peers in her cohort as well as from upperclassmen.
“Luckily, since WBB is like a small program it’s like 40-50 kids, then we all have a group chat and we’re our own community and that’s great because they know what we’re going through, they know what I’m going through, we’re taking like similar classes,” Babayeju said. “So to have someone in that way it’s really nice. I think in the beginning, it was hard to deal with because you never anticipate this, you plan 18 years like, ‘Oh, I’m gonna go to college … I’m going to live my best life,’ and then [the] corona[virus], and you can’t do that.” 
Kaela Gallagher, a junior in the program, has been attending hybrid classes in Milan and is living on campus like most students at Bocconi. When Gallagher first arrived in Milan last month, the university was operating smoothly with students attending classes every other week to lower the amount of students present in each class. 
Last week, Gallagher only had one midterm and used her free time to travel around Italy. She visited four different cities and took an empty train around the country. With Italy usually being a tourist hub, seeing the cities so empty made Gallagher feel like she had them to herself.
However, a few days ago Bocconi announced that it was moving courses fully online for the two weeks due to the rise of coronavirus cases in Milan. As of Nov. 3, the daily average of confirmed cases within the past seven days was over 3,100 in Milan, according to the New York Times. Gallagher said she is waiting to see what happens and hoping for the best. 
“[There’s] a lot of different powers involved and as far as coronavirus goes we really are at the mercy of the country we’re living in and whatever the university there decides to do,” Gallagher said. “WBB is just a small part of each of these universities so we really just have to go with the flow.”
Kristen Gao, a senior in the program, had to return to the United States while studying in Milan last spring. Gao said that the panic started at the end of February when news broke out that two people in a nearby town had tested positive. Soon after, USC called back all study abroad students to the United States and although Gao was not considered a study abroad student, her mother urged her to fly back to the U.S. 
“I was kind of hesitant to fly back because by that Friday after things had more or less returned to normal,” Gao said. “I remember when I took the taxi to the airport the buses were completely packed as if things were totally normal, although a few days before [they] were empty because people panicked about the virus. So yeah, there was that and then I flew back on Saturday. A few days after [I left], Milan had totally shut down so [I] actually made a good call.”
Like most seniors in WBB, Gao returned to USC for her last year, but because of the pandemic, many of her classmates returned to Hong Kong so they could continue in-person classes and have a somewhat normal college experience. Despite the semester going online, Gao remained at USC because of her interest in pursuing a career in real estate and the ability to remain local rather than having to travel to Hong Kong.
Gao is enjoying being able to take USC classes again and said that despite the coronavirus, she has had an overall positive experience through WBB. However, transitioning back to USC in an online environment has had its shortcomings.  
“I think the interesting thing about it being online is that I see a lot of familiar faces in my business classes, but it’s not like I can go walk up to them after class and catch up with them. I really just keep in my classes and kind of remember speaking to them freshman year,” Gao said. “I think we do lose a lot just because you’re at USC as a freshman [and] when you’re a sophomore you’re not there so we don’t really know any underclassmen aside from the ones in our program.”

Tensions continue to rise within the USC community as the presidential election results between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden continue pouring in. After figuring out how to navigate mail-in ballots, constantly refreshing poll results and reading article after article, different student political clubs hosted watch parties to get together virtually to observe the results of the election pour in. 
Some of the clubs that hosted virtual parties included the Trojan Left, USC GOP and Trojan Democrats. 
Eleven passionate students armed with drinks and commentary gathered at Trojan Left’s election viewing party. Trojan Left is a club that is committed to action-based steps toward “radical change on every level.” Most recently, the club has been involved in local campaigns for David Kim in California’s 34th district and Fatima Iqbal-Zubair in District 64 of the California State Assembly. 
However, Garrett Humble, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and economics who is the social media director of Trojan Left, is not feeling hopeful about the current presidential election. 
“I’m not really excited about this election either way,” Humble said. “I don’t find that we’re going to get really substantial change regardless of who wins in this election.”
Humble went on to explain that while he felt Trump has been a “horrible” president, Biden has not proven to be a much better candidate as he hasn’t been doing enough to improve the country’s current issues.
“I don’t think either candidate is going to bring anything positive to the table,” Humble said. “The Biden campaign and the Democratic establishment is, in my opinion, not acting like an opposition party. They’re not acting as some force that’s actually trying to fight against this tide of fascism and racism and nationalism that’s sweeping the nation.”
Morgan Farrier, a freshman majoring in astronautical engineering, serves as the communications coordinator for USC GOP. Farrier is watching election results play out from her hometown of Palos Verdes, Calif. 
As Biden led on the West Coast, Farrier said she hoped for another four years of Trump’s presidency but would accept the results either way. 
“I hope Trump wins, I do support him as a candidate, not that he’s perfect,” Farrier said. “I do think it’ll be a very close race. It could go either way, honestly. I mean whatever the results are, that’s what the people chose.” 
Over the summer when exploring on-campus groups to join, Farrier joined USC GOP to connect with like-minded individuals. 
“The political tensions were very, very high … and I am OK with talking to people who have differing political opinions,” Farrier said. “I [wanted] a group that I at least have common grounds with.”
Farrier said she hopes for a Republican presidency because she prefers Trump’s policies and actions toward the Middle East and his health care plans. 
“[Trump’s] already done a lot with peace deals in the Middle East, so I suspect we’ll have more of that,” Farrier said. “He’s started to do protections for pre-existing health care. He says he’s going to continue that. For me, I have a pretty serious health disease, so that is something that I look at and I am happy he’s compromising on because that used to be a more Democratic position.” 
According to The New York Times, Trump has not negotiated “peace” deals, as said deals continue to oppress Palestinians. Trump also supported Saudi Arabia’s government and created tensions between the United States and Western allies by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and Syria.
While numbers continue to fluctuate as ballots are counted, Andrew Binder, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law who currently serves as president of the Trojan Democrats, said he has hope that Biden could pull out a win in remaining states.
Binder joined the Trojan Democrats his freshman year; however it was not his first shot at politics. Prior to starting college, Binder worked for Hillary Clinton’s general election campaign in 2016. In high school, he served as an organizing fellow in a swing county in Pennsylvania. 
“[Hillary Clinton] ultimately ended up winning by a margin of tens of thousands of voters, which was not enough to flip the state of Pennsylvania, but did help Democrats in subsequent local elections,” Binder said. 
As president of Trojan Democrats, Binder said he has also seen various hands-on volunteering efforts from students throughout the semester. 
“It’s been inspiring to see dozens of students turn out to make a difference in the election,” Binder said. “We’ve had great participation every week whether it’s reaching out to fellow USC students or calling into swing states to try to help Biden and Harris or some of the Senate candidates like Theresa Greenfield in Iowa or Cal Cunningham in North Carolina.” 
In the Trojan Democrats club, a swift and open dialogue about lack of optimism and painful reminders of the 2016 race raged on while swing states awaited counting. However, Binder held on to hope. 
“I am cautiously optimistic that we will win this, I’m not quite sure when the presidential election will be called,” Binder said. “It could be tonight, but it could very well be later this week as well, and that’s great.” 
The cautious optimism is carrying Binder’s spirit throughout the remainder of vote counting. If Biden wins, Binder said he is carrying hope for a speedy end to the pandemic and reuniting the country. 
“We’ll be happy not only because we put in the work to help this campaign, but also because of what it means for so many Americans who are struggling right now,” Binder said. “Because of the coronavirus pandemic, because of subsequent economic recession, because of the racial injustice that continues to persist unaddressed and because of the environmental destruction that’s been brought by the policies of the current administration.”

Every election year grips Americans with political frenzy, flooding them with texts, phone calls and social media posts urging (or shaming) them to vote for a certain candidate or set of policies. These messages often promise that voting is the antidote for solving society’s problems. However, achieving positive political change requires Americans to move beyond the ballot.
To be fair, elections do have serious societal consequences. The political turnover caused by the 2016 election pushed dramatic shifts in government policy in the realm of immigration and human rights. The contentious 2020 election will be similarly monumental, as it will determine whether the United States will continue its current course.
While past elections have marked political turning points, they are not foolproof methods for securing certain policies or even changes. U.S. history has proven time and time again that politicians often fail to deliver on their campaign policy platforms.
The most obvious example is sitting President Donald Trump, who ran on a platform of building a wall on the southern border and having Mexico pay for it. Four years later, this border wall is not even half completed, and taxpayers have felt the brunt of its expense. Trump also promised to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, but his actions have led to little concrete action, much less the $1.5 trillion funding allocation he called for.
Broken promises, however, are not exclusively a Trump or a Republican problem. Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama, promised in 2008 to create a tax credit for low-income people saving for retirement; Congress rejected his proposal in 2011. He also pledged to eliminate tax breaks for oil and gas companies, but Congress shut down his proposal.
Politicians can have earnest intentions, but they do not always translate to tangible progress. This does not necessarily mean that politics is pointless, as cynicism helps nobody. However, it does mean that meaningful political engagement does not end at the ballot box.
Voting is just one of many ways for Americans to participate in politics. Extra-voting activism includes unconventional methods such as letter writing, phone campaigning or boycotting. These options require more effort than filling out a ballot would, but they are just as effective, if not more so. 
Marginalized groups have used unconventional political participation to great effect. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement’s civil disobedience secured the passage of the Voting Rights Act. In the 1970s, the Delano grape strike secured better pay and benefits for California farm workers, as well as a law establishing the right to collective bargaining for farmworkers. 
Activism is a viable way to shape the political landscape by gaining politicians’ attention and influencing public opinion. These methods allow people, to some extent, to control what issues and policies appear on the ballot. They also allow people to hold their elected representatives accountable for fulfilling their promises.
Moreover, active citizens have more freedom than politicians to work toward change. Politicians are bound to a multitude of competing interests, so systemic change often gives way to compromises and quid pro quo. Active citizens do not face the same limitations, so they can boldly assert their vision and push society toward change.
These impacts are especially salient in the context of voter suppression, which has historically pervaded the electorate and is arguably reaching a new peak today. After high voter turnout from marginalized groups in the 2008 election, 20 states passed voting restrictions and closed polling places in Black and Latinx communities. This year, armed vigilantes patrolled polling places, robocalls threatened Black voters and ballot boxes suspiciously caught fire.
Given the longstanding obstacles to the democratic process, it is especially important to encourage activism and other forms of civic engagement beyond voting.
Ultimately, voting’s significance is contingent on unconventional political participation, not elected representatives. It is far more productive to continue advocating for issues one cares about long after election season is over than to waste energy on shaming non-voters or overrelying on elected officials.
Civic engagement beyond the ballot can be as simple as talking with friends and family about important issues. It can also include emailing or calling local politicians to push for action on certain policies. If that sounds intimidating, consider joining a community organization to gain training and experience in political activism like voting efforts or census counts. 
Regardless of what they do, Americans must reevaluate how they engage with their political system. Voting and activism come hand-in-hand. Combined, they are the best tools for inciting meaningful and substantive change.

During my freshman year at USC, my roommate and I scoured the internet for cheap concerts. As two East Coast transplants in Los Angeles, we were excited to explore the local music scene while hopefully skirting Ticketmaster fees and crowded venues. 
After combing through Reddit and Instagram, we found the perfect place: The Smell. With only a $5 admission fee for a full night of music, we eagerly attended a Saturday night concert at the venue in early September 2019. Little did we know The Smell would become one of our favorite spots in L.A. and a staple weekend outing for the rest of the semester. 
The Smell isn’t the typical music venue. It’s located Downtown in a nondescript back alley next to a dumpster. The double doors of the punk club open up to a dark space with intricate murals and graffiti decorating its brick walls. But what surprised me even more than the atmosphere of the venue was the predominantly Latinx audience. 
Growing up in Baltimore, white acts and fans dominated the majority of the punk scene. But moving to L.A., with Latinx people making up nearly half of the population, this exposed me to the rich (and often overlooked) history of Latinx punk bands and their contributions to the genre. 
Historically, the punk scene has been associated with white men. While there’s no denying that the popularity of bands like The Ramones, The Clash and The Sex Pistols was driven in part by the frustrations of the white working class in the ’70s, the overall image of punk music has been whitewashed. 
Los Saicos, which formed in Lima, Peru in 1966, is widely considered one of the pioneering bands in punk music. The band put out songs with a raw, garage sound 10 years before punk took off in the United Kingdom and New York City, with some critics even crediting the group with inventing the genre. But frontman Erwin Flores, who helped write the group’s nihilistic lyrics for songs like “Demolición,” considered them a “predecessor to punk,” in a 2013 interview with Noisey. 
But during the heyday of punk in the ’70s and early ’80s, Latinx bands in East L.A. began adopting their own DIY punk aesthetic. The center of the Latinx punk rock scene was at The Vex, a small club started by local Latinx bands eager to carve out a space for themselves. Bands such as The Zeros, who were known as the “Mexican Ramones,” The Plugz and The Brat played at the venue as well as backyard shows and other private parties. 
These bands inspired a generation of Latinx rockers to sing about the plight of Chicanos (typically in Spanglish) and confronted stereotypes about their community. Jesus Velo, bass player for Los Illegals, said in an interview with Remezcla in 2016 that Latinx punk in the ’80s stemmed from frustration with inequality rather than outside punk influences like the Sex Pistols. 
“We didn’t go home to our bedrooms after playing punk shows and jumping up and down and spitting beer at each other. We came home to the barrio and you heard gunshots,” Velo said. 
But a vital part of East L.A.’s Latinx punk explosion was Alice Bag. While many consider people such as Patti Smith, Joan Jett and Kathleen Hanna to represent the pinnacle of women punk rockers, Bag deftly challenged machismo culture in the Latinx punk scene. Wearing pink dresses and heavy Chola makeup, her feminine appearance starkly contrasted her frenzied onstage performances. Bag’s unapologetic aggression alongside her embrace of femininity is an essential part of punk history and a pioneering force in the Riot grrrl movement. 
While many elitist white rock critics have declared punk dead, it is very much alive in L.A. The scene now revolves primarily around challenging ideas of heteronormativity and misogyny in the Latinx community as well as contending with xenophobia and often grim socioeconomic realities. Although the coronavirus has put shows at places such as The Smell and backyard concerts on hold, the Latinx punk rock scene is sure to survive and evolve with its dedicated and innovative contemporaries. 
Maria Eberhart is a sophomore writing about Latinx pop culture. Her column, “For Your Consideration,” ran every other Thursday.

Good game. GG. Great match. Every athlete has their go-to way of showing appreciation for their opponent after a game. Competitiveness is in the heart of every athlete, but so is sportsmanship. Whether you win by a landslide or lose a deep-seated rivalry game, a trait of every great athlete is respect for their opponent. 
We now find ourselves near the end of a competition that has lasted several months: the 2020 election. However, this doesn’t seem like the average regular season game. The feeling is more reminiscent of Game 7 during any championship series. I have the same anxiety and energy surrounding the election as I would for a game tied in the fourth quarter with two minutes left.
When the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, everyone could confidently say that Cleveland won because of the final score and the fact that Golden State conceded to the rightful champions. Despite the emotions of losing after having a 3-1 lead, Golden State respectfully acknowledged what Cleveland had accomplished.
Now the country finds itself in a tough situation where current President Donald Trump has declared victory before the race is over. Along with casting doubt over the legitimacy of mail-in ballots, Trump is doing everything he can to hold onto his power. 
If a team declared victory before the clock had run out or argued about whether fair points should be counted, I would be upset. Many athletes and teams have a “win at all costs” mentality, which might include arguing with refs or getting a little more physical on the court. We have seen both nominees go into this campaign with a “win at all costs” mindset, but declaring victory before every vote is counted goes directly against the principles of fair competition or democracy. 
Although sportsmanship is something that every athlete should show to their opponent, there may always be an element of trash talk. Being able to get in your opponent’s head provides a significant competitive advantage. I’ve heard everything from sarcastically saying “nice shot” to jabs at a player’s character and everything in between.
As a volleyball team playing at the collegiate level, our coach constantly has to remind us to keep our words on our side of the net. Sometimes players may get so wrapped up in trash talking and passive comments that they end up distracting from the ultimate goal of victory. As a team, we constantly have to be reminded that too much banter noise leads to ineffective volleyball communication on the court.
In a very similar fashion, as seen during the first 2020 presidential debate, meaningless jabs distract from the essential things that need to be discussed. A presidential debate should educate viewers on policy positions, but when one is consumed by noise from interruptions, the goal of the debate loses its impact.
For the past several months, the political parties have attacked each other tirelessly. Once the race is over and campaigning is done, concession is due from the candidate who is defeated. A simple sign of respect from each party would go a long way to unite the country when it needs it most. 
No matter who we are playing, whether it be our own team in practice or UCLA at the end of the season, handshakes and congratulations are always in order. The winning team can celebrate briefly and learn from what worked. The losing team may be disappointed but can come back stronger by learning from what did not work. 
Regardless of what happens, both parties have a lot to learn and improve upon from this one-of-a-kind 2020 election. I can only hope future election campaigns look to what this year entailed and positively build upon it. Verbal sparring will continue, but it cannot detract from crucial conversations.
For now, I am praying not only for my chosen candidate to come out on top but for there to be grace and sportsmanship following the results. Seeing both parties hopefully let down their guard, celebrate each other’s spirited campaigns and respect the democratic process will be a refreshing sight in this chaotic year. 
Looking back at my optimism for honesty and respect in the wake of election results, it is now clear that the country will not have the refreshing feeling that I had once hoped for. With millions of absentee ballots waiting to be counted among several battleground states, Trump prematurely said late in the night, “We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.”
With claims of fraud and a push to recount ballots, it is abundantly clear that Trump will not be able to lose with grace and integrity as any great competitor should. Instead, he will stick to the age-old tactic of blaming the refs, which in this case is the democratic process.
