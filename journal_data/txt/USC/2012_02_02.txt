After defeating the Wisconsin Badgers 168-111 two weekends ago, the No.5 Trojans will face a tough challenge this weekend when they take on the No. 6 Cal Bears and No. 3 Stanford Cardinal at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
USC is currently 3-1, while Cal and Stanford stand at 3-1 and 6-1 respectively. In the same way he expected challenges on the women’s side, USC coach Dave Salo knows this weekend will not be easy and might very well serve as a barometer for the squad’s postseason success.

“[This] is the beginning of the championship season for us,” Salo said last week, in regard to the men and women taking on the Bay Area teams. “[This weekend] will test our mettle.”
Cal, who won last year’s national title, is led by Tom Shields, who was the NCAA champion in two events last season: the 100-yard backstroke and the 100-yard fly. Also leading the Bears are Nolan Koon and Mathias Gydesen, both of whom are among the top in the country at their respective events.
For the Cardinal, Chad La Tourette is the main threat. He has not lost a long distance event in four years and is currently ranked first in the country in the 100-yard freestyle. Also contributing are Bobby Bollier and Matt Thompson, who are among the nation’s best in the 200-yard fly and 400-yard individual medley, respectively.
The Trojans have some of the best swimmers in the nation as well, led by sophomore Vladimir Morozov, who is first in the country in the 50-yard and 100-yard backstroke. Joining Morozov will be freshman Chad Bobrosky, who currently ranks ninth in the nation in the 200-yard freestyle, sophomore Dimitri Colupaev, the nation’s leader in the 200-yard freestyle and junior Alex Lendrum, who is ranked second in the 200-yard backstroke.
This year’s squad features four swimmers who were All-American selections last year — Morozov, Colupaev, senior Jeff Daniels and sophomore Jack Wagner.
The scoring for this meet will be different. Though the three teams will be competing on both days of the competition, USC will only go on record against Cal the first day and Stanford the second. After the weekend, the Trojans will take on Utah at home, followed by the Pac-12 championships. The NCAA championships qualifiers begin March 8.
The action for all three teams competing will begin Friday at 2 p.m. and will continue Saturday at noon, both days at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

How much less is 15 than 25? Quantitatively, the answer happens to be the difference in new scholarships available to the USC football team for the upcoming year —compared to its previous season. The Trojans, still under NCAA sanctions will have to forfeit 10 scholarships per season over the next three years, which allows them to return to normalcy before the 2015 season.
For a team that — under typical circumstances — operates with 85 scholarship players, the penalty is easy to see as more of a sizable inconvenience than a knockout punch. You could argue that USC, with its current bevy of talent complementing a deep and well-tread coaching staff, is good enough to outlast its punishment without letting the program as a whole take a hit.
But, as you know, football is not a game based solely on numbers, and anyone looking at this predicament from a qualitative perspective will realize that 10 players lost, even in one year, will put USC at a steep disadvantage.
That’s because it’s not simply a number lost, but rather an athlete — an athlete that now finds himself elsewhere in the country, perhaps even gearing up to face the Trojans in the future.
Take junior college fullback Kelvin York, who originally committed to USC but changed his mind after realizing the scholarship math didn’t add up in his favor. He will now call Utah his home and will bolster a potentially powerful Ute squad that seems to be the Trojans’ best challenge in the South Division.
Three-star athlete Jaydon Mickens shares the same story, barely missing the cut because of the scholarship reduction. He is heading to Washington to play for the Huskies, who have used newly acquired recruiter Tosh Lupoi to bring in their best recruiting class in recent memory.
There are certainly others, beyond these two, who have had to face a similar reality as well. Consider the blue chippers who simply denied USC because of the situation the team is in, opting to play for programs with more stability and recent success.
Several top offensive linemen the Trojans targeted relentlessly — five-star recruits Kyle Murphy and Andrus Peat —  chose Stanford, while five-star safety Shaq Thompson publicly expressed his doubts in USC on Twitter before deciding to sign with Washington.
At the center of all of this is USC coach Lane Kiffin and his staff, who have been juggling numbers and talent non-stop for the past few months. Kiffin had to reduce interest in recruits like York and Mickens to make space for other potential candidates, but in doing so put the team at risk of not fielding the 15 best possible athletes.
There was almost no room for error for the Trojans — a tricky situation when trying to predict the future.
Of course, national signing day brought some relief in the form of two four-star prospects, Leonard Williams and Nelson Agholar, who were by no means a lock to commit. Coupled with recent signees on the offensive line — Zach Banner and Gerald Bowman — and the other seven recruits that give USC a top-10 class, according to Rivals.com, and it’s easy to see that much of this juggling paid off for the Trojans.
This year’s class can be seen as a major success, no matter the reduced numbers. But this is just the first of three extremely difficult trials for the Trojan coaching staff, who will have to deal with a limited roster next season and the upcoming departure of several key components of the team, including star quarterback Matt Barkley.
All of this is to be expected, but hardly any of these issues can be prevented. And as long as the Trojans need to continue to turn away potential stars to stay within their scholarship limitations, there will continue to be a significant force working against them.
How much will this force impact the team? Good luck doing the math on that.

The Women of Troy saw their 17-point lead evaporate right in front of their eyes.  Washington State shot itself back into the game, closing the gap to within 2 points with 40 seconds to play.  But on its final possession, USC got what it needed:  a 3-pointer by freshman guard Ariya Crook to seal the victory.
Close call · Freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama and USC shot 44 percent from the field against the Cougars. USC plays Washington Sunday. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
“It was amazing.  It was one of those moments when you just want to jump for joy,” sophomore forward Cassie Harberts said.  “She just had so much emotion and that was a really significant shot for her game.”
Crook had six points on the night, but none were bigger than the final three of the game.  Harberts led all players with 19 points.  With the win, USC pushed its record to 12-9 and 6-4 in Pac-12 play.
The Women of Troy shot 44 percent from the field, including a scorching 50 percent in the second half, thanks in large part to the Cougars’ 20 turnovers.  Washington State was able to stay in the game chiefly because of its 9-18 shooting from three-point range.
A key factor in the victory was the return of Briana Gilbreath, who scored 14 points on 6-8 shooting.  The senior guard and second leading scorer had missed two games because of a knee injury.
“[Gilbreath] was a huge spark off the bench,” Harberts. “She fires up everyone else on the floor, so whenever we needed that defensive stop, that rebound, that little hustle play, she was on the court.
The Women of Troy also received a huge spark from junior forward Christina Marinacci, who pulled down 10 rebounds and drove the floor for loose balls several times.
“I just felt like I had to do all the little things tonight, which I’m used to, I’m a role player,” Marinacci said.  “That was why I got the boards, so that’s really how I looked to have a presence in the game.”
Washington State guard April Cook led the Cougar comeback in the second half, shooting 4-4 from behind the arc and finishing with 18 points.  The comeback began with just under seven minutes left in the game.  The Cougars outscored USC 19-4 in the final 6:10 before Crook’s shot closed out the game.
USC, now in a third-place tie with UCLA and Arizona State, face Washington Sunday at the Galen Center before heading up north to face the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal.  In their first meeting of the season, the Women of Troy gave Stanford all it could handle in a 61-53 loss.  But the players were focused on the task at hand after tonight’s game.
“[The win] was huge, coming off the three game losing streak,” Harberts said.  “We need to take that into Washington and that’ll just help our mindset and our focus as we roll through the Pac-12.”

The USC men’s basketball team was unable to build on its victory over Utah on Jan. 28, falling to Washington State on Thursday night, 60-53.
Not enough · Sophomore guard Maurice Jones scored seven points against the Cougars Thursday. The Trojans dropped their 17th game overall and will look for their second conference win Saturday against Washington. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (6-17, 1-9) recovered from an early deficit to take a 13-11 lead with 11:50 remaining in the first half. From there, the Cougars (12-10, 4-6) regained control, jumping out to a 30-24 advantage going into the break. Forward Brock Motum set the tone early for Washington State, contributing 14 points in the first 20 minutes of action. USC received eight points from Greg Allen off the bench.
The Trojans stuck with their opponent throughout the second half, fighting back after a 9-0 run by Washington State to bring the score to 49-45 with 6:42 left in the game. The Cougars outpaced USC 11-4 the rest of the way to pick up the win.
USC was unable to control Motum, who finished 9-11 from the field and 7-10 at the free-throw line en route to a 26-point, eight-rebound performance. Motum was the only player on the Cougars to finish with double-digit points.
Junior guard Greg Allen paced the Trojans with 17 points, including five 3-pointers in 34 minutes of action. He was aided by sophomore forward Garrett Jackson (15 points) and freshman guard Byron Wesley (12 points).
Jackson, however, battled foul trouble and registered 29 minutes of playing time. Sophomore guard Maurice Jones matched his third- lowest scoring output of the season with just seven points.
Washington State dominated the Trojans at the free-throw line and on the boards. USC attempted three foul shots, while the Cougars got to the line 19 times, converting 14. The Trojans, who used just seven players (including six in the first half), were also outrebounded, 31-18.
Next up for the Trojans will be the University of Washington at the Alaska Airlines Arena in Seattle on Saturday. The Huskies (15-7, 8-2) are coming off a 71-69 victory over the Bruins and improved to 12-2 at home with the win.
Washington is ranked 10th in the country in rebounds per game (40.3) and 31st in scoring (76.7 points per game). Their starting backcourt of guards Tony Wroten and Terrence Ross is averaging over 31 points per contest. Tip-off is scheduled for 8 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on the Fox Sports Network.

The USC Libraries’ Special Collections Display in Doheny Memorial Library is featuring a small exhibit, Civil Rights: A View of the Struggle, throughout February in honor of Black History Month.
Literary context · The collection includes newspaper clippings and a documentation of Yvonne Burke, a black Congresswoman in the 1970s. - Talia Taniela | Daily Trojan
Melinda Hayes, the head of the special collections department, said the exhibit serves to commemorate the black civil rights movement and to give students an understanding of their rights.
“Bringing attention to the things that happened [in] the past can relate to the things happening in the present,” Hayes said. “We wanted to honor Black History Month by taking out some of the materials we have in our collections. This shows how far we’ve come from where we were 40 years ago, where we are now and how far we still have to go.”
The collection contains a series of newspaper clippings, including some from the Daily Trojan; books by acclaimed writers, such as James Baldwin and the Watts Writers Workshop that date back to 1965; and a thorough documentation of the political life of Yvonne Burke, one of the few black women to be elected to Congress in the 1970s.
“It’s easier to get a sense of the importance of the materials when you can gauge them in a physical way rather than through the library catalogue,” said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public planning for USC Libraries.
“It’s much more dramatic, in a way, the impact of the kind of stories that exist in any kind of library collection once you see [the display] for yourself.”
Cynthia Brass, president of the Black Staff and Faculty Caucus, said exhibits like Civil Rights remind students to reflect on the past.
“Even though it’s labeled as the month of February, black history is every day of the year. The month itself gives everyone the change to get a better view and understanding and improve their knowledge about this history,” Brass said. “Getting people to gather as a whole to identify where they’ve gone, where they are and where they need to go — this month enhances all those things. Depending on who it is and their mentality of a recognition of a few great people, this is a month to look at everyone, even if you haven’t read about them in the history book.”

Today, most students know Mirian Mejia as the friendly, smiling EVK Restaurant and Grill cashier, but 30 years ago she found herself making the life-changing decision to leave everything she knew in El Salvador to escape a civil war.
“It’s so hard, but sometimes you have to decide: What do you want?” Mejia said. “Your life, your family or to stay [in El Salvador] and die?”
Everybody’s cashier · Mirian Mejia talks to Vanessa Wilkins, a freshman majoring in print and digital journalism, outside the EVK Restaurant and Grill worker’s station. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Mejia and her 11-year-old son left their family behind to find safety from what started as a coup d’état in 1979 but resulted in a power struggle that quickly escalated into a civil war. Lasting 12 years, the civil war killed more than 70,000 people and more than 30,000 disappeared, according to a report released by the United Nations in 1992.
Mejia and her son found a new home in Los Angeles, 3,000 miles away. Mejia was able to keep only limited contact with her family, who did not have a telephone of its own, and instead relied on using phones in the offices of the local phone company and following a strict time schedule.
“I had to make appointments with telephone companies,” Mejia said. “[My family] had to go there at a specific time, and I had to call at that time. That’s how you did it.”
It was 10 years before Mejia became a U.S. citizen and was able to return to El Salvador to see her family in person, and she now goes back to visit for about a month every summer.
Mejia had already taken some English classes in El Salvador, but she said her teachers were all British, so American English was a completely new dialect she had to learn. She would spend her days working in places like hotels and flower shops and her evenings in school to improve her English.
About 11 years ago, Mejia began working for USC Hospitality and is now a beloved cashier at EVK, always welcoming students with a smile, a quick conversation or a word of advice.
“You can see in their faces, ‘What happened with you? You look different today,’” Mejia said of her regular customers. “They say, ‘I have a cold,’ and I say, ‘Go take a hot tea,’ or something like that.”
Last spring, when USC Hospitality considered cutting hours at Trojan Grounds, the only 24-hour food option on campus, students turned to Mejia as a source of inspiration to argue against the proposition, creating the Facebook page “WWMD (What Would Mirian Do).”
The page describes Mejia as “the lovable, no-nonsense employee who swipes your card with a slight smile,” and asks, “Would Mirian stand for our rights as hungry late-night study-ers being violated?”
Now that the proposition has been abandoned, the page is a place for students to express their appreciation. One post from December reads, “I didn’t make it to EVK once this semester. … That breaks my heart.”
Mejia said she enjoys interacting with students.
“They see us as a family,” Mejia said. “Even if we don’t talk too much with them, they look at us like this is home.”
It is also home to Mejia. After about 30 years in Los Angeles, she can never see herself returning to live permanently in El Salvador. Only her son and his family live in Los Angeles, while her brother, sister and the rest of her extended family live in El Salvador.
Mejia said she loves the city and enjoys her job too much to leave.
“I love the kids,” Mejia said. “We are here for them. Everything they need, we have to be available. And I love it.”
how dumb is this writer? the fb page is just some twat mocking evk and mirian. how crude.
The article fails to mention if she legally came into the US.  I think that would have made a more complete story.  The writer seems to imply she magically arrived in the US with her son.  I am glad to hear she became a citizen after 10 years.

There is a job for you in my company when you graduate.  We need “go getters” like you in the highly technical and fast moving field of mail sorting.   In a few years, you’ll probably make assistant mail room manager no problem.  I hope the Post Office stays around to keep you busy for years to come…
It is amazing what qualifies as news with the DT staff…
What a touching story. Thank you DT for sharing this with us!
It’s called a profile piece. It’s a well done piece on a woman who has served this school for ten years, and she has an awesome story to be told.
This isn’t news. It’s a very well done and personable human interest piece. It’s a great piece of journalism that required reporting and investigation and research. Thank you DT.
Can you believe all the haters?
Would you consider the New York Times a newspaper? Because it is full of feature articles like this. Not everything needs to be “news” and not everything claims to be such.
NYT is strictly birdcage liner Matt.
Try the WSJ for real news
Are you capable of actually reading that one? Seems a bit out of your league – but I guess you’re a “business major,” right? What a waste of a degree.

at 7:13 p.m., a suspect entered an unsecured library in Bridge Hall and removed a cell phone from an unattended purse.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 6:31 p.m., a student reported that she observed a suspect following her while she was walking near 28th and Figueroa streets and the subject waited for her when she entered a fast-food restaurant. When the suspect continued to follow her, the student fled into a nearby bar and advised a bartender. The bartender transported the student to her residence in his vehicle. The student did not report the incident at the time it occurred, so DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspect.
at 3:06 P.M., DPS officers responded to a student in Taper Hall complaining of severe abdominal pain. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #14 responded. The RA Unit examined the student and transported her to California Medical Center Hospital for medical treatment.
at 10:16 a.m., a student reported that another student yelled profanities at her and poured coffee on her vehicle when she inadvertently cut him off while moving into the left lane to turn onto campus near Parking Structure A.
at 8:19 A.m., DPS officers responded to a staff member who injured his leg when he slipped and fell inside Seeley G. Mudd Building. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #15 responded. The RA Unit examined the staff member and transported him to Good Samaritan Hospital for medical treatment.

USC’s Norris Cinema Theatre will screen Education Under Fire, a documentary produced by USC alumnus David Hoffman that discusses the religious persecution against the Bahá’í people in Iran and recaps attacks against the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education, on Friday.
Though BIHE is more than 7,000 miles away from USC, Hoffman, the film’s executive producer and co-creator, said USC students can help halt injustice.
“Every USC student should see this documentary and imagine in the 21st century a government that will use weapons against its own people to deprive them of higher education just because of their faith,” said Hoffman, a USC alumnus of the class of 1976. “Education is the bedrock of society and a fundamental human right so we are urging students to speak out against this injustice.”
One of the ways students can speak out is to sign an online petition that generates letters to top Iranian officials, Hoffman said.
“There are USC students here on this campus that have helped innocent people fight injustice and transform lives,” said Ata Farhadi, a graduate student studying law and a member of the Bahá’í Student Association. “When someone on this planet is denied a basic human right, we are all attacked because we are all human.”
Farhadi said ignoring injustice abroad is dangerous.
“We make a moral choice to either fight injustice or ignore it,” Farhadi said. “If we choose the latter, we are lessening ourselves and depriving our community. We all pay a price for every moral judgment we make and if we allow religious persecution in Iran there may come a day when we too will suffer the same fate.”
In 1948, Iran signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 26 of the document lists education as a human right. Still, Education Under Fire argues the Iranian government is attempting to strip Bahá’ís, Iran’s largest minority group of about 300,000 people, of their right to education.
Education Under Fire is a 30-minute documentary that follows the lives of several BIHE teachers who the Iranian government arrested in the name of national security. According to Hoffman, however, one of the key principles of Bahá’í faith is to obey the government or ruling power.
“The Bahá’í are a peaceful and noble people,” Hoffman said. “They have had to cope with arrest, imprisonment and even torture, but they still maintain BIHE.”
The film focuses on BIHE and how the institute is still in operation despite the Iranian government’s intervention, but Jeff Kaufman, the film’s director and producer, said the documentary is not against Iran.
“There are many Iranian friends, neighbors and even strangers who have reached out to help Bahá’í people,” Kaufman said. “This film shows the potential of Iran and the real power a whole group of people can make.”
Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni said all students, regardless of religion or study, can connect with the documentary.
“This documentary hits upon very important issues for USC students, such as pluralism, diversity, education and civil rights,” Soni said. “No matter what you’re studying, there is an aspect of what is happening to Bahá’ís in Iran that you can learn from.”
In addition to the petition, one of the main goals of the campaign is to convince university leaders in the United States to give Bahá’í students credit for BIHE courses so they can pursue post-graduate education internationally. Not long after the campaign launched last November, Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney officially announced that the school accepts BIHE coursework for transfer credit.
USC Bahá’í Club President Laleh Mehrrafiee attributes this success to the size and strength of the Education Under Fire movement.
“This campaign is the largest action the Bahá’ís have taken to fight this persecution, and we are their voices, essentially, because if [Bahá’ís] in Iran stand up against this persecution, they end up more persecuted against,” Mehrrafiee said.

Verna B. Dauterive, a USC trustee, donated $30 million to the university to fund a building that will serve as a center for interdisciplinary social science research and teaching, President C. L. Max Nikias announced Thursday.
Verna and Peter Dauterive Hall will be built along Childs Way at the current location of the University Club, said Nikias in a statement. The six-story building will have space for classrooms, laboratories and offices.

“[The building] will become an active resource for scholars in all social science fields, fostering fresh connections between the traditional disciplines in the social sciences and those of business, law, public policy and other professional studies,” Nikias said in an email to students. “As the physical link among these disciplines, the building will become the heart of [students’ and faculty members’] interdisciplinary collaborations, a place where our insightful social scientists can study and work to solve today’s most pressing social problems.”
Verna B. Dauterive, who held a faculty position in the Rossier School of Education, where she received her master’s degree in 1949 and doctoral degree in 1966, made the donation in honor of her late husband, who received his bachelor’s degree from the Marshall School of Business in 1949. The university first announced a $25-million donation from Verna B. Dauterive in memory of her husband in 2008, saying it was the largest single monetary gift from a black donor to an institution of higher learning.
“For more than 60 years, she has been a passionate ambassador for her alma mater, and we should all be extremely grateful for her exceptional support,” Nikias said. “Through her generosity, she creates a singular legacy, one that will benefit the Trojan Family — and our society — for generations to come.”
Verna B, Dauterive served as a teacher, superintendent’s coordinator of integration programs and principal during her 62-year career with the Los Angeles Unified School District. She also served as chair of the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing for two terms and was the first female president of the USC School of Education’s Educare Support group, where she looked at the viability of expanding USC’s study abroad program in Europe. She is a member of the USC Associates, the USC Alumni Association and Town & Gown.
Peter W. Dauterive served as an executive at Founders Savings & Loan Association before becoming president and CEO in 1973. In 1986, he formed his own property management firm. He was a member of the Republican National Committee and President Ronald Reagan named him  to the National Commission for Employment Policy. At the time of his death in 2002, he was a director of the California Science Center, active in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and was involved with the Los Angeles Figueroa Corridor.
The couple met in Doheny Memorial Library while studying at USC. Verna B. Dauterive was one of the founding members of the USC Black Alumni Association. Donations under her and her husband’s name have been made to the Norris Cancer Center, Marshall School of Business, Rossier School of Education and USC School of Theatre.
What an amazing gift to the university!
Fight On!

Even when it’s not an Art Walk night, L.A. art galleries are playgrounds worth exploring.
The art scene is ever changing, but quite a few galleries are leaning toward the fun and fantastical. For these galleries, art doesn’t need to be so serious.

For starters, how about art with robots and donuts? Eric Joyner’s “It’s a Jungle Out There,” featuring guest artist Pure Evil, is available for viewing at the Corey Helford Gallery in Culver City until Feb. 8.
Pure Evil’s spray-paint-on-canvas works feature close-ups of faces with paint dripping from their eyes, and Joyner’s oil-on-panel creations are unabashedly whimsical. In “Tiger Mountain,” for instance, robots are depicted walking alongside an elephant carrying a load of three giant donuts.
In “All Wrapped Up,” a red robot holds a donut in one hand while battling a snake coiled around it with its free hand. Every painting has intriguing details that show Joyner’s knack for keeping his art interesting and elusive.
“I kind of keep things a little complex, so if you’re looking at something and you think possibly it could have two or three different meanings, I think that’s good,” Joyner said. “Some people think it’s funny, and some people think it’s sad. I think it’s more subtle — you’re not hit over the head with it.”
Beyond the aesthetic complexities, Joyner’s style contains a playful nature, especially through the incorporation of donuts.
“It could be because my mom tried to bribe me to go to Sunday school with donuts, or it could be that I just like them and it’s an interesting shape, the circle,” Joyner said.
But Joyner also remembers a more specific moment. His paintings started out with robots based on Japanese tin toys from the ’50s and ’60s until he saw a scene in the film Pleasantville that inspired him to add the donuts.
The taste for the whimsical continues at Thinkspace Art Gallery on Washington Boulevard. On Saturday, Liz Brizzi and Ana Bagayan will present their fascinating work. The latter’s exhibition title, There is Time to Kill Today, is already enough indication that this won’t be an ordinary art show.
Bagayan’s subjects are humans with big eyes and dead looks that give them a disturbing demeanor, no matter the setting. Other subjects of Bagayan’s works are based on people under hypnosis who believe they have been abducted by aliens.
Liz Brizzi’s New Works show stays a little closer to reality. Her pieces take inspiration from urban scenes. This city setting is especially enhanced by a gritty, almost ephemeral quality because of the use of mixed media.
Together, the artist’s tastes create a show that puts together two different aesthetics unified by the artists’ penchant for giving normal images their own twists.
The explosion of creativity continues at Crewest Gallery, which will present its new show Blow Up L.A.: The Art of Blowing Up Your City on Feb. 4 on Winston Street. The show centers on a variety of artists tackling the same canvas — vinyl toy dolls. The dolls are custom made by a company called Jamungo, which will bring its dolls called BUDs and NADEs.
But the dolls aren’t your typical kids’ toys. The BUDs’ heads are in the shapes of bombs, and the NADEs’ heads resemble grenades — hence the name of the exhibition. Crewest is just another stop on the route of Aerosol Warfare’s Blow Up (Your City!) traveling exhibition, which will feature artists Pyro, Bezerk ONE and Justin Garcia. Owner of Aerosol Warfare and curator of the Crewest Show, GONZO247 adds that it was initially challenging to work with so many artists, but that it ultimately creates an intriguing, diverse show.
“We have a wide variety of styles of art on the dolls so I think what the viewer will see is how many different directions the shape can take,” GONZO247 said. “We have some urban artists but also people that work with oils and do fine art, and then people who do crazy design work. So it’s what the artist does best — with an urban edge.”
Vinyl doll decorating isn’t new; there are other similar figures out there for artists.
“There are a lot of designers and creative people starting to design toys that aren’t like your average Barbie doll but have more of an urban feel,” GONZO247 said.
Accordingly, galleries are offering plenty of exciting shows this season. The beauty of the current art scene lies in the fact that on any given gallery row, you never quite know what you’ll stumble upon.

When a band breaks up or goes on hiatus, it can be shocking, even devastating, to its members and listeners.
But with the music industry in a slump, breakups are more common than ever. The outlook, however, is not one of despair, but one of hope: Reunions are also starting to spread like wildfire.
Fame and fortune, if ever attained, are transient. But loyal fans are forever, as is a love of writing and performing. For this reason, several bands have not been able to resist the urge to get back together.
Phantom Planet, known for its hit “California,” went on “indefinite hiatus” in November 2008, but, surprisingly, announced via Twitter in November 2011 that a reunion was imminent.
Sure enough, a video soon appeared of the group practicing for the first time since the hiatus. They will perform two shows at the Troubadour on June 13 and June 14, and the first night is already sold out.
But not all bands get to share in the good fortune of a reunion. Other acts like Thursday and Thrice are now facing the opposite end of the spectrum: Both bands announced in November that they would be going on “indefinite hiatus.”
“Indefinite hiatus” is in quotes because fans tend to assume the worst at the mere mention of these words. In many cases, “indefinite hiatus” is a very apropos term to describe what a band is going through.
Bands have a lot on their shoulders, with pressure from financial, personal and social burdens. These stress factors don’t even include the music-making process. Sometimes, bands simply need a break, and they want to be honest with fans so they can understand not to expect anything for quite a while.
If a band goes on hiatus, there is no deadline to finish an album. They do not have to constantly keep their eyes open for touring opportunities or work on designing new merchandise. They finally get to detach themselves from the limelight and the ever-present demands of fans and record labels.
There could also be a strong chance that fans’ patience during hiatuses will pay off. Naturally inspired and prepared to face the grueling grind again, many bands come back rejuvenated, usually generating a tremendous amount of excitement and attention.
In other cases, however, “hiatus” does not even begin to encapsulate what a band is going through. For example, pop-punkers Blink-182 announced that it was going on an “indefinite hiatus” in February 2005, but it seemed clear that the band had no intention of ever making music again.
Guitarist and singer Tom DeLonge, who went on to form arena-rock act Angels & Airwaves, had no desire to be a part of the band. He even changed his phone number so there would be no way for bassist/singer Mark Hoppus or drummer Travis Barker to contact him.
In response, Hoppus and Barker’s side project +44 wrote a scathing attack against DeLonge for what transpired between them. Called “No, It Isn’t,” the song appeared on +44’s 2006 album When Your Heart Stops Beating.
Surprisingly, Blink-182 reunited, likely because of a fatal plane crash that nearly killed Barker and served as a wake-up call to all three members. But Blink-182 is an excellent example of a band whose declaration of being on hiatus actually was just PR jargon to cover up what was an ugly situation within the group.
All this talk about hiatuses, however, should not detract from actual break-ups because they do occur. And when they occur, there is a strong sense of finality to them: Take the storied career of rock group R.E.M., a band with a 31-year career that only recently came to an end.
In a statement on its website, the group said, “As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band … Working through our music and memories from over three decades was a hell of a journey. We realized that these songs seemed to draw a natural line under the last 31 years of our working together,” wrote bassist Mike Mills, referencing the band’s work on its final release, the compilation Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011.
It is expected that bands will get burnt out, whether they are veterans like R.E.M. or relatively new. Even with hiatuses and break-ups seemingly running rampant, there is always hope that artists will somehow release new music in the near future.
If not, the music they did make will live on in the lives of their fans.
After all, even a little band called The Beatles broke up, but no one has forgotten them yet.

The Twilight Sad’s latest album, No One Can Ever Know, finds it experimenting with a new sound, one that is darker and heavier than its previous efforts.
Foreign import · Hailing from Glasgow, the Scottish band The Twilight Sad makes its mark as it returns to the United States with well-crafted lyrics, near-perfect instrumentation and an intriguing atmospheric quality. - Photo courtesy of Motormouth Media
Hailing from Glasgow, Scotland, The Twilight Sad has often been compared to its Canadian counterpart, Arcade Fire. On this particular album, however, the vast orchestral sound that has become its signature is significantly less pronounced in favor of a sparse, industrial atmosphere.
James Graham’s unhindered Scottish accent and soaring vocals are the perfect compliment to this type of music. The lyrics on this album, on the other hand, are generally dismal, and the guitars are distorted under heavy synths. The places and situations evoked are grim and uninviting, establishing a moody quality that’s more prominent than in previous albums.
The first song on the album is the leisurely morose  “Alphabet.” The refrain of the song is ironic because the singer tells someone he is so sick to death of the sight of you now / safe to say never wanted you more. A drowned-out and unrecognizable guitar underscores the melancholy indecision of the lyrics. A slower song might not be the most intuitive way to introduce No One Can Ever Know, but in this case it works. Unlike some of the album’s later brash and aggressive songs, “Alphabet” is a mellow yet solid choice to kick-start the album.
The second track, “Dead City,” is significantly more grotesque than the first. The nightmarish imagery of the lyrics takes center stage against a gloomy synth reminiscent of The Cure or Joy Division. The album title takes its name from this track, in which the singer, James Graham, wails an unnerving no one can ever know.
“Sick,” the first single from the album, follows and is more traditionally guitar and drum-heavy than the previous tracks, even as it retains the lyrical solemnity of the overall album. This song easily has one of the most haunting subjects of the entire record — a person struggling with an unknown illness or injury. James Graham sings the refrain, you look so frail / you know, with considerable emotion and forthrightness.
The next track, “Don’t Move,” is effects-laden and synth-heavy, straying away from the raw feeling of the previous songs, which make it weaker. Though this particular track does not stand out, the power of the lyrics is so pronounced on the rest of the record that the language requires special attention to allow the depth of experience necessary to connect with the songs. The listener can thereby forgive a few missteps.
“Nil” returns to the original sentiment of the other tracks and also revisits the sound that popularized The Twilight Sad. It begins with an organ and progresses to the grand orchestration of earlier albums. This track highlights the experimentation happening on this album and the great departure from the band’s comfort zone.
In contrast, “Don’t Look at Me” sounds like a cover of The Cure, as the influence of ’80s gothic-synth-rock is present on the track. It is high-energy and despondent, danceable and shoegaze, all at once.
“Not Sleeping,” in contrast, takes a simpler approach as a mellow, languorous tune with a steady beat and a choral sound where Graham’s vocals and ability to weave a tale are highlighted by sparse instrumentation.
The second single, “Another Bed,” is probably the most mainstream and consumable. The music is less distorted than the previous tracks and the lyrics are not as downhearted. It is much freer, less enclosed and not as anxious as previous songs, and the effect makes it sound less overwrought than some of the more somber tracks.
The closer, “Kill It in the Morning,” is fast-paced, but reflects the overall mood of the album with its distortions and synth-heaviness. At its start, it sounds almost like twisted carnival music but progresses into the synthesized indie-folk that permeates the album.
Though this album marks a distinctly different direction from previous efforts, the sound provides something unique and interesting for the band’s listeners and for audiences of indie music in general. The album is definitely rewarding for its precise instrumentation, poignant lyrics and atmospheric quality.

I’m fiscally conservative, but socially liberal.” The number of times I’ve heard fellow students use this line to describe their political views has led me to wonder why it is so popular.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
I eventually figured it out: Students are afraid of giving people the idea that they oppose gay rights.
Students should not allow the closed-mindedness of conservatives who voice opposition to gay rights prevent them from identifying with the Republican Party.
The pinnacle of Republican-led intolerance was reached at a GOP debate last November. During the debate, audience members booed a gay soldier who addressed a question to Rick Santorum.
Instead of reproaching the audience members for disrespecting Army Capt. Stephen Hill, Santorum launched into a tirade against gay sex in the military.
The actions of fundamentalists like these give the entire Republican Party a bad rap, especially among socially progressive voters.
As a result, many conservative-leaning students are reluctant to voice their political affiliation for fear of criticism and improper labeling.
Occurrences like the Santorum debacle must not be used to tarnish the image of Republicans, especially among college students who, according to a 2011 study by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, tend to be supportive of gay rights.
Rep. Ron Paul, for example, supports the privatization of marriage and the ability of all people to make marriage contracts without government involvement.
Fittingly, Paul’s core group of followers is largely composed of young voters: In the Iowa caucus, 48 percent of voters under 30 chose Paul.
Despite many people automatically associating Republicans with Christian family values, Republicans are most concerned with fiscal prudence and limiting government powers. “Preserving the sanctity of marriage” is hardly emphasized among more moderate mainstream Republicans.
Core Republican values ring especially true today, during a time of crushing federal debt. The most important issue is climbing out of debt and putting Americans back to work. Until then, social issues will have to be kept on the back burner.
Most Republican presidential candidates — or, at least, viable ones such as Mitt Romney — are focusing their time and energy on promoting free-market principles instead of wasting time preaching about gay marriage.
The philosophy of the Republican Party as a whole allows individuals to live without government oppression. A new generation of open-minded conservatives passionate about promoting this philosophy without forcing a certain definition of sexual morality is emerging.
Now is the time for young conservatives to dispel these misconceptions by standing strong in their views and by showing how educated and tolerant the emerging generation of Republicans can be.

As stated above..
Decreasing school costs is quite simple. Schools are only able to charge such high rates because the government makes subsidized loans easily available to students. The loans allow colleges to maintain outrageous prices and years down the road, when broke students finally graduate and are unable to pay off those loans immediately, the government cashes in on interest, which is redistributed to God knows where. Without these loans, college kids would be unable to afford school and univerisites would be forced to either contract or drastically lower prices, leaving the money in the hands of educated and productive societal members. Even through contraction, students would choose more realistically priced universities (given factors like merit based scholarship) and finish college without mountains of debt to pay off.
If the choice is between “big government” in matters of business or “big government” in telling me who I may and may not marry, I’ll go with the former, thank you. And until mainstream Republican candidates are *at least* neutral on gay issues, that’s what it amounts to.
(And that’s if you trust them to do the “small government” thing on the financial side. I saw no evidence of that during the last Republican administration.)
“The philosophy of the Republican Party as a whole allows individuals to live without government oppression.”
A government that does not allow me, as a gay man, the same rights as anyone else is oppressing me, so you more than anyone should be championing gay marriage. 
It is easy for you, as someone whose identity is not being legally discriminated against of course you think “social issues will have to be kept on the back burner.” You and I agree that something must be done about the federal debt, we, however, disagree about what it is that should be done, though that is beside the point. I will not allow social issues to be pushed to the back burner, because I am not a second class citizen. I am as much an American as any straight person, and I deserve the same treatment. Also conservatives got “protect marriage amendments” on ballot on at least two states this year, so much for the back burner.
2011 was prehaps the best year for GLBT equality in the history of our movement, despite the Republican attempt to delay our progress with a hollow “we need to focus on the economy” or “social issues aren’t important when people are unemployed.” Really Republicans are hypocritical babies when it come to GLBT rights. When a court affirms equal protection for all Americans they’re “activist courts,” but a conservative decision like citizens united comes down judges are lauded. Hopeful 2012 will continue this positive momentum, the vote in Washington State seems to demonstrate that it is. Civil rights can’t be on the “back burner” if we are truly a free country. Shame on you for insinuating that some people deserve fewer rights because of the state of the economy.
School costs have been rising for decades, not just during Obama’s term of office. Ron Paul is simplistic if he says school costs so much because the economy sucks. How does he propose to reduce the cost to $5,000. He doesn’t really offer solutions. He is an extreme candidate that wouldn’t be able to get any of his ideas into practice.  
People who believe that voting for Republicans based on the fiscal position of the party are completely fooling themselves if they don’t acknowledge that less government does NOT equate to staying out of social issues. Republicans are perfectly happy and doggedly determined to have the government dictate how people should behave on a myriad of social issues (gay rights and abortion are just two examples).
Actually, decreasing school costs is quite simple. Schools are only able to charge such high rates because the government makes subsidized loans easily available to students. The loans allow colleges to maintain outrageous prices and years down the road, when broke students finally graduate and are unable to pay off those loans immediately, the government cashes in on interest, which is redistributed to God knows where. Without these loans, college kids would be unable to afford school and univerisites would be forced to either contract or drastically lower prices, leaving the money in the hands of educated and productive societal members. Even through contraction, students would choose more realistically priced universities (given factors like merit based scholarship) and finish college without mountains of debt to pay off.
Also, while I agree the Republican party is in the wrong for dictating social issues such as gay rights, abortion is a much more touchy subject. It would be fairly ignorant to compare ideology of gay rights and abortion.. lets not lump them into one giant cloud of “social issues.” Abortion is a life/death argument.. my simple response to those who are pro abortion is this- while you may believe aborting a fetus is not the same as ending a life, you must agree it is the equivalent of ending the potential for life. In other words, are you satisfied knowing that had your parents aborted you, you would not be here? And if so, when we have the ability to time travel, you would be okay with it should I convince your parents of doing so? I mean come on.. think. People talk a mean game, but when it comes down to it, who wouldn’t want to get the opportunity to live in this messed up world?
I think the anti-gay rhetoric sets the GOP back a lot.  The younger generation is for gay rights, because odds are, they know someone who is gay, a relative, a classmate, a favorite teacher, etc. I personally will never vote for an anti-gay republican, no matter how much I may like his fiscal policies. One needs to simply take a look at Rick Perry’s debacle of an ad denouncing gay service men and woman.
Or maybe students just don’t know what “fiscally conservative” means.  Ask a group of those Ron Paul supporters if they think Pell Grants should be eliminated and let’s see what they say.
Pell grants should be eliminated as soon as we eliminate the need for them. Education, like a lot of things, costs WAY more than it should. Ron Paul wants to drive down the price of education et al so that we can all afford to go WITHOUT the government’s so-called help. 
Think about it: if a year of college cost $5,000 rather than $20,000, we could all go. Those that couldn’t get merit-based aid could work their way through college, maybe get loans that aren’t so huge that no one can ever get out from under them, and when they get out of school, start an actual career and pay off any loans a hell of a lot more quickly and fairly.
Why do people need Pell grants? School costs too much!
Why does school costs so much? The economy sucks!
Why does the economy suck? We keep electing greedy jerks–Democrat AND Republican–who only pretend to care about us when they need our votes!
Ron Paul is the only person running for president who has been saying the same things for decades, no matter who’s (not) watching. On top of that, it turns out he’s been right the whole time.
I cannot understand how any decent person could want to vote for anyone BUT Ron Paul unless they’re rich or uninformed. Hopefully, the latter can be corrected, despite the efforts of the mainstream media and Wall Street.
Ron Paul has a lot of great ideas that resonate with many centrist Republicans/Dems(including myself) but many of his policies are also very polarizing and extreme which unfortunately pushes many potential voters away from him. For examples, things you already know:
He wants to close:
Dept of Energy, Interior, Commerce, Energy, and HUD.
Drastically cut budgets for FDA, CDC, DHS, NIH, EPA
Eliminate all foreign aid(AIPAC would never allow this).
Also drop corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, eliminate capital gains/dividends taxes(!?!), permanently extend the bush tax cuts which make up a substantial portion of our deficit, eliminate gift tax and estate tax, and repeal dodd-frank and sarbanes-oxley(?!?!?!)
All of the above are things that promise he will never be elected though him winning the GOP primary would definitely force Obama to discuss a lot of key fiscal issues which would be good for the country.

As students at a college with a vibrant queer community, we hear a lot about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered activism. We can recognize the relevance of LGBT rights in the upcoming presidential election. An unfortunate truth, however, is that the current focus of campaign media coverage — the Republican party — has featured repeated attempts to shoulder this component out of the picture.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
I question how any student who supports LGBT rights could stand behind the Republican Party. Most students are receptive to LGBT issues: a 2011 poll conducted by the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute indicated that 71.3 percent of college freshmen nationwide support same-sex marriage. Given the sentiments of our demographic and the prominent role many college students play in the LGBT movement, it is vital we stand behind a presidential candidate who does not wish to hold back the movement’s progress.
During the Florida primary debate last week, Republican candidate Rick Santorum vocalized his adamant belief that the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell was a mistake. Santorum demonstrated an embarrassingly weak grasp of the issue when he asserted that the repeal was an endorsement of “sexual acts” in the military.
Santorum seems to think that allowing LGBT individuals in the military to come out awards them special privileges. One has to wonder how he worked that out, considering the only way this right could be called a special privilege is if straight soldiers were not allowed to “come out” as straight.
The most distressing part about Santorum’s comments, however, is not the content — it is the reaction of his Republican audience. It began before Santorum even opened his mouth: The audience produced audible boos in response to the video of Army Capt. Stephen Hill asking a question regarding the progress made for gays in the military.
The fact that any audience member booed an honorable member of the American military is disturbing. Even worse: He was booed for asking a relevant question regarding basic human rights.
Santorum’s comments suggest outright homophobia, but the other presidential candidates are not much better. No Republican has expressed outward support for the LGBT community.
Other campaign issues are equally relevant, but it is difficult not to question the judgment of someone who does not even demonstrate respect for the equal rights of all citizens.
Equality is one of the central tenets of American democracy. Such disregard for equality spawns domestic unrest and prevents America from tackling these other problems with a capable and unified citizenry.
College students should not allow our nation to be led in the direction of bigotry; otherwise, we could spend our lifetimes cleaning up the mess.

Ms. Berry, remind us again, where does President Obama stand on gay marriage? And is he, or is he not, as a presidential candidate, holding back, as you would say, “the movement’s progress”?
You’re also factually wrong. The incident with CPT Hill occurred on September 22nd. But since when would silly things like facts get in the way of liberal talking points?
A proud Trojan???  If that was the case I’m not sure you would choose to personally attack a student  based on an opinion column.  Why don’t you keep your comments focused on the issues and not worry about what her major is?  A proud idiot maybe…….
Those are old school Trojans. Ask those who attended here, say, 20+ years ago. You’ll know what I mean. SC has recently jumped on the political-activism-progressive-ideology bandwagon. That school across town along with all its sister campuses have been on since day one.
I am a proud Trojan alum. First, I don’t get Berry’s description of a “vibrant queer community.” Where I live this would be a derogatory description of gays. Second, I do not consider it bigoted to oppose gay marriage, but to support civil unions that provide essentially the same civil rights. Third, as Berry matures, she will I hope meet and appreciate many fiscal conservative and pro-family pro-life gay Republicans. Finally, I must ask what in the world is “majoring in narrative studies”? I suggest that you choose a real major that will land you a real career so that you will contribute to rebuilding America’s economy and not be a lifelong drain on us like so many today. Marshall SOB is a good place to look.

If you believe in a thing called The Darkness, better head over to their website and check out their brand new song and music video  “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now,” the first new material they have released in nearly seven years since their sophomore album One Way Ticket To Hell…And Back. The song is available as a free download on their website.
In addition to the release of a new song, singer and frontman Justin Hawkins recently said the band is close to completing their third album. While it’s not certified that “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” is going to be included in the nine songs on this upcoming album, it’s clear that The Darkness is back.
The band broke up in 2006 when Justin Hawkins had to split for rehab due to his cocaine abuse. The band was put on hiatus and the rest of the band members formed Stone Gods while Hawkins fronted Hot Leg for a couple years after getting out of rehab. This interval was filled with rumors of the band reuniting which finally – and thankfully – became the truth in 2011, when the band hit the road again, first performing at the Download Festival and playing a small selection of new songs that included “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.”
Hawkins says that the band is almost done with the new album, which is tentatively set to be released March 17th, his birthday.
“Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” is more mellow than their previous work and its subdued energy is a bit disappointing for the first song they’ve released in six and a half years. The song also sounds pretty modern. Old fans expecting their typical 80’s glam rock revival better prepare for something a little more indie-sounding. Still, it’s certainly nice to hear Justin Hawkin’s peacockish falsetto again. Hopefully there are better things to come on the next album and if there are, nothing’s gonna stop The Darkness’ comeback.

After a strong showing this past weekend in Tempe at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Kick-Off Weekend, where the 16th-ranked Women of Troy clinched a spot in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships, USC (3-0) will look to stay in top form as they face St. Mary’s today followed by a match against Pepperdine on Saturday.
“We have two challenging matches ahead against St. Mary’s and Pepperdine coming in ranked as well, but I just have confidence that the girls are going to show up and play big,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “There is a big difference between going through the motions and understanding what is at stake; with only only seven eligible players these girls are  tight-knit group, who really worked hard, and look like they truly enjoy it.”
Earning a place in the ITA Indoor Championships, which are Feb. 10 – 13 at the University of Virginia, is a big step for a green USC squad, especially since they missed out on the tournament last season.
“Next week we may end up playing three teams in the top 10 in the country [in the ITA tournament] and it will be a big challenge for us,” Gallien said. “I really feel confident that our girls are going to ante up and spill their guts out.”
The Women of Troy will be starting their weekend against a talented Lady Gaels team, which is coming off of a tough 4-0 loss to the UCLA Bruins in the ITA Kick-Off. The day prior, though, St. Mary’s took down No. 25 Oklahoma behind sophomore Jenny Jullien.
Jullien, who will be slated for the No. 2 spot against USC junior Danielle Lao, ranks No. 68 in the nation for singles. Along with fellow sophomore Jade Frampton, Jullien was named the West Coast Conference Doubles Duo of the Month after going 8-1 in October.
In the top spot for singles, St. Mary’s will throw out two-time WCC first-timer junior Catherine Isip. Though Isip may not be currently ranked, she started out at No. 59 in the Fall Rankings and remains a threat for USC freshman Zoë Scandalis.
After facing off against St. Mary’s, the Women of Troy will welcome the No. 26 Pepperdine Waves (1-0) into Marks Stadium on Saturday.
Pepperdine will be looking for a much-needed victory against USC, something that hasn’t happened since 2001, with an extremely difficult upcoming schedule with games against No. 1 Florida and No. 2 Stanford.
The Women of Troy boast four players among the nation’s top 100 singles players, led by freshman Sabrina Santamaria at No. 18 followed closely by Scandalis at No. 19. Lao and sophomore Kaitlyn Christian round out the rest of the group at No. 42 and No. 99 respectively.
“Even after I gave them Monday off, I got a phone call that at 9 o’clock, Zoe and Sabrina are out hitting,” Gallein said. “In basketball they say you can’t teach height, in tennis you can’t teach hunger and drive.“
While there may be a dearth of experience on Gallien’s squad, especially at the top of both doubles and singles, there is no denying the immense talent on the team. Despite having three freshman among the top 6 singles players (Scandalis, Santamaria, and Gabriella DeSimone), expectations are high for the Women of Troy after a very encouraging fall season.
“We’re very young, but very mature,” Gallien said.  “The three girls starting right now are hungry, motivated, and dedicated. They really put a spring in everyone’s step and are not afraid of playing in big situations.”
