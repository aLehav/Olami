Notre Dame’s fake field goal had USC reeling Saturday.
It’s now apparent the officials were confused too.
The Pac-10 coordinator of football officials David Cutaia told the Los Angeles Times that the crew who worked the game at Notre Dame made a mistake in not calling a penalty on the Fighting Irish’s fake field goal.
The Notre Dame holder completed a 25-yard pass to a receiver on the play – but, upon further review, the receiver stood deceptively in bounds even when the field-goal unit came onto the field.
Cutaia said Notre Dame deserved a 15-yard penalty on the play and should have had to repeat the down.
USC coach Pete Carroll declined to comment on the story to the Times.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill Thursday paving the way for the construction of a 75,000-seat football stadium in Los Angeles.
The bill called for an environmental waiver on the construction of the stadium in Industry,  a city about 15 miles east of Downtown Los Angeles. The bill’s passage means USC Trustee Edward Roski Jr.’s Majestic Realty Co. will now be exempt from complying with the development and operation requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.
“This is the best kind of action state government can create — action that cuts red tape, generates jobs, is environmentally friendly and brings a continued economic boost to California,” Schwarzenegger said in a press release. “This legislation allows us to move forward with the construction of the nation’s greenest football stadium and create thousands of jobs.”
The $800-million project is expected to pump more than $760 million annually into the local economy, and will include an orthopedic hospital, a movie and live-performance theater and office and retail space, according to the press release. The stadium will also be the first LEED-certified stadium, powering its operations with solar panels and using recycled water. It will also be built into a hillside, reducing the amount of steel and concrete used.
Roski and Majestic had lobbied earlier extensively to pass the law for stadium, arguing that it would create about 18,000 jobs and additional long-term profits if the company is able to bring an NFL team to the stadium.
Majestic will approaching seven teams in February, after the Super Bowl, about a move to the city based on their present contracts and audience markets. According to the Associated Press, the company will be speaking to the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, St. Louis Rams, San Diego Chargers, Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers.
The stadium bill previously hit a snag when the City of Walnut threatened to sue neighboring Industry, citing the environmental and traffic impact of the new stadium.
Walnut City Council was eventually persuaded to drop the lawsuit in return for a $9 million payment deal for traffic improvements as well as an annual payment to a Walnut “community fund.”
Roski is prepared to break ground on the project as soon as a team is locked in and is confident that Majestic will be able to raise the funds despite tight credit markets, the Associated Press reported.
I think that it is a smart thing to do because people are in need of jobs. And it’s a good thing that it is going to be generating its own energy and reusing its own water. Great for that it will help the economy and the environment. So I think that the stadium will help a lot.

For six years, Lauren, a sophomore majoring in international relations and neuroscience, endured verbal and emotional abuse from her father.
She felt she was never good enough, smart enough or pretty enough for him. Her father was able to fool her friends into believing that he was outgoing, charismatic and loving, she said, but behind closed doors, he was vindictive, hateful and spiteful.
Table talk · Panelists speak to students about the influence of culture in intimate partner violence in a discussion hosted Thursday as part of USC’s Domestic Violence Awareness Week. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
For six years, Lauren was a victim of domestic violence.
“If I heard him coming home, I would go into a different room,” she said. “The more I tried to avoid him, the more angrier he got.”
Lauren is just one victim of domestic violence at USC.
According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in four women will be the victim of domestic violence in her lifetime.
“Choose four women you know,” said Michael Kahn, a volunteer for the USC Men Care program and a senior majoring in English, said. “What if one of those women was a victim of domestic violence? That’s why you should get educated.”
The Center for Women and Men — which runs the Men Care program — and the Women’s Students Assembly made a push this week to help students learn more about the societal problem.
In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness month, CWM and WSA cosponsored on-campus events to educate students about domestic abuse. Students made pledges not to use their hands for violence during the These Hands Don’t Hurt event, wore purple ribbons to raise awareness and decorated T-shirts to express solidarity as part of the Clothesline Project.
CWM Director Danielle Lancon said the most common type of domestic violence reported at USC is intimate-partner violence — violence between people currently or previously in a romantic relationship.
Department of Public Safety Det. Josh Voyda said less than 1 percent of calls to DPS each year are related to domestic violence. But Lancon said numbers can be unreliable.
“Most is unreported and we never find out who the students are,” she said. “The more visible we are on campus, the more likely students are … to take advantage of our services.”
CWM helps students who are victims of domestic violence find long-term solutions, including new housing, restraining orders or a new course schedule.
In the short term, students suffering from domestic violence can call DPS.
When the department receives an emergency call from a victim, officers will arrest a person if the victim has visible injuries. DPS will then contact an on-call judge to issue emergency protective orders while the suspect is still in custody.
The protective orders expire within 48 hours, however, which is why CWM assists in developing long-term solutions.
In addition to providing typical resources to students, CWM has developed the all-male peer education group USC Men Care. Todd Henneman, adviser of the Men Care program, said the group teaches men how to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault.
Rather than tag men as wrongdoers, the group’s goal is to talk to other men on campus as allies so that they feel comfortable taking action against domestic violence without fear of any gender-based stigma.
“Most domestic violence … [is]  committed by men, but very few men commit domestic violence,” he said. “What Men Care does is involve the silent majority of men and to get them to speak up to show that most guys don’t approve of abusive behavior.”
The University Park Health Center’s Counseling Services offers student victims short-term counseling and can refer them for long-term counseling off campus.
Lauren said a major part of her healing process dealt with finding what she wanted for herself instead of trying to fulfill the unrealistic ideas of perfection her father demanded of her. Counseling helped her through this process, she said.
Lauren is now an advocate of domestic violence awareness and finds empowerment in talking about those issues in the WSA group on campus.
“I am making a positive difference, she said. “That’s the biggest thing I walked away from my experience with — being able to give a voice to an issue that has been silent for so long.”
[…] Groups aim to spread awareness of domestic violence   For six years, Lauren, a sophomore majoring in international relations and neuroscience, endured verbal and emotional abuse from her father. […]

Providing permanent housing for the homeless in Los Angeles could save taxpayers thousands of dollars, according to a study conducted by a nonprofit organization with the assistance of USC researchers.
The study, the first of its kind in Los Angeles, was conducted by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles and released last week. It took place between 2005 and 2009, following four homeless individuals in Los Angeles and noted their mental health, physical health, encounters with law enforcement, substance abuse and housing costs.
According to the study, taxpayers are spending about $20,000 more in a two-year period per person living on the street than those in permanent housing, meaning they would save 43 percent of the cost if a homeless person were offered a place to live.
“After being placed in permanent housing, there was a decrease in their visits to the hospital, substance abuse and jail time,” said Michael R. Cousineau, an associate professor of preventive medicine research at the Keck School of Medicine, and the principal investigator for the report.
The study used self-reports and public records to calculate how much the city spent on each homeless individual based on the number of visits to the hospital, time in jail and psychiatric or substance abuse help, and compared it to the relative cost of living in permanent supportive housing.
Suzanne Wenzel, a professor at USC’s School of Social Work and an expert in homelessness and substance abuse treatment, agreed that decreased visits meant less taxpayer money would be spent.
“These findings for Los Angeles are consistent with other cost studies in other parts of the country,” Wenzel said. “Other studies have shown that nights in a psychiatric hospital or a night in jail are actually more costly than a night in permanent supportive housing.”
Cousineau said he hopes city officials acknowledge the results of the study when deciding how to deal with the homeless population.
“Hopefully they will see the supportive results and invest in housing instead of in shelters,” he said. “The cost for the government would go down with the reduction of services.”
Wenzel also said officials should pay attention to the results of the study, as it offers a straightforward solution to the problem of chronic homelessness.
“It’s further evidence to policymakers that providing permanent supportive housing is an appropriate approach to addressing homelessness,” she  said. “Providing housing to homeless individuals is not only the humane or ethical approach, but also more cost effective.”
Cousineau pointed out that other areas that have conducted studies like this one have used the results to improve the states of their homeless populations.
“Many cities like San Francisco have done a lot like turning four crumbling hotels into permanent housing for homeless,” Cousineau said.
He added that he hopes the study will raise awareness and help local organizations, such as Skid Row Housing Trust and A Community of Friends, address the problem.
“Skid Row Housing Trust is just not enough given the problem of homelessness in Los Angeles,” Cousineau said.

Pete Carroll remembers the second-to-last time his team lost. How could he forget it?
It was only 13 months ago that USC was stunned on a sleepy Thursday night in September by an Oregon State team that jumped all over the Trojans from the outset. Coming off a big win against Ohio State, the Trojans saw their national title hopes dashed when they couldn’t complete a comeback at Reser Stadium and lost, 27-21.
Second crack · Last season, Fili Moala (75) and the USC defense allowed Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers to break out for 186 yards. The 2009 Trojans will be keying directly on the 5-foot-7 runner who caught them off guard in 2008. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
Although the Beavers have taken two of the last three contests against the Trojans, Oregon State has not won in the Coliseum since 1960. USC will look to keep that streak alive Saturday when it takes on a surging Oregon State team at 5 p.m. at the Coliseum to push into the second half of the season.
“We’ve been road warriors and out and about,” Carroll said. “We’ve had a great time on the trips, and we’ve grown from it. It’s wonderful to be back and playing in front of our home crowd.”
Four of the Trojans’ last six games are at home, a welcome return for a road-weary squad. A sellout crowd is expected for the first time in the Coliseum this season for the highly anticipated revenge match.
Oregon State has given USC more trouble than any other team in the Pac-10 and is the only conference foe to have multiple victories against the Trojans since 2002. Carroll credited Oregon State coach Mike Riley for being well-prepared and jumping ahead of the Trojans early in games.
“They’ve been really effective against us on both sides of the ball,” Carroll said. “They’ve been able to give us problems, and they’ve had good fortune at their place two of the three times.
Last year’s game served as the national introduction to Oregon State running back Jacquizz Rodgers. Then only a freshman, the 5-foot-7 Rodgers repeatedly slipped through the arms of USC tacklers to keep the Beavers’ offense moving downfield. The tailback finished the evening with 186 yards and two touchdowns on 36 carries against a defense that Carroll said might have been his best by season’s end.
After being held to less than 100 yards rushing in each of his previous three games, Rodgers broke out in his last game against Stanford for 189 yards and four touchdowns.
“He’s the style of runner that really demands it of your defense,” Carroll said. “You give him a crack, he can take it. If you make a mistake, he’s going to take advantage of it.”
But the diminutive Rodgers won’t be anonymous to USC coming into Saturday’s game. Despite having to replace a bulk of its starters, the Trojans are fourth in the nation in rushing defense, giving up less than 68 yards per game.
With USC’s defense also leading the country in sacks, Riley pointed out that stopping the Trojans at the line of scrimmage will be essential for his team.
“I’m very impressed with their front — they don’t give people many breaks,” Riley said. “They’re high-energy and really hard to block, and that’s going to be a key factor in the game.”
Saturday’s game will also be an opportunity for retribution for Oregon State quarterback Sean Canfield, who tore cartilage in his throwing shoulder in the 2007 game in Los Angeles. Canfield was trying to slide after a scramble but was hit by then-sophomore USC safety Will Harris and had to sit out for the remainder of the season.
After serving as a backup to Lyle Moevao in 2008, Canfield is taking advantage of his senior season by completing 68 percent of his passes en route to becoming one of the conference’s established veterans.
Earlier in the week, Canfield said that despite Oregon State’s recent success against USC, the Beavers know they will be facing an uphill battle on Saturday.
“We don’t back down, we’re in attack mode just like every other team we’ve faced,” he said. “I think considering that we’ve taken them down twice in the last three years, they’re going to want to win.”

When the final whistle blows Sunday afternoon at McAlister Field, five USC women’s soccer players will jog across the field, applaud the fans and sign autographs one last time.
No. 9 USC (11-4, 3-1 Pac-10) hosts Oregon State on Friday at 3 p.m. and Oregon on Sunday at 1 p.m. in what is the last homestand for the Women of Troy this season.
Road’s end · Redshirt senior defender Meagan Holmes, who has played at USC for five years, will play her final games at McAlister Field. - Young Kim | Daily Trojan
“It hasn’t really [sunk in yet]. The season’s gone by quicker than I could even imagine,” redshirt senior Meagan Holmes said.
Holmes is more accurate in her statement than she might think. This is the earliest last home game for the Women of Troy in more than 12 years.
“It’s crazy that the end is almost here. We only have three weeks of guaranteed play left,” redshirt senior Marihelen Tomer said. “It’s crazy how the last five years, never mind four years, goes by.”
But the season isn’t over yet. After suffering a humbling 4-0 defeat to No. 1 Stanford last week that snapped the Women of Troy’s nine-game winning streak, USC bounced back to defeat Cal in overtime 3-2.
The victory at Cal helped USC get back on track, especially since the Women of Troy had a two-goal lead in the second half. But the combined six goals that USC allowed in the second halves of both games last weekend concerned coach Ali Khosroshahin, and the Women of Troy know they have to improve in this area if they want to sweep their last homestand.
“We need to be more consistent and trust each other. We really haven’t put together a solid two halves,” Tomer said. “I think we’ve put in some strong halves here and there, but putting together the full 90 and working hard and together is what we’re going to try to come out and do this weekend.”
The Women of Troy also learned in the games last weekend that the team breaks down when verbal signals can’t be heard. While the football team has speakers to emulate crowd noise, the soccer team doesn’t have that luxury. So, the Women of Troy had silent scrimmages this weekend, where the only communication came from non-verbal signals.
“We’ve noticed when we do give up goals it’s when we’re unable to hear each other,” Holmes said. “So we’ve been working on finding each other’s eyes and communicating without verbal language.”
Holmes has had to work harder this year than most because of the youth of the team. Six starters are sophomores or freshman, including two on the backline. But three of the starters are graduating seniors who will be playing their last game on McAlister Field.
Senior goalkeeper Kristen Olsen broke the USC all-time shutouts record two weeks ago by notching her 26th shutout of her career. She’s started all but one game for the Women of Troy this year and became just the third player in conference history to notch back-to-back Pac-10 Player of the Week Honors.
Tomer has started every game in the midfield for USC and is fourth on the team in points. And lastly, the former All-American Holmes missed the first part of the season with a knee injury, but she returned a few weeks ago to anchor a young backline that was in need of some veteran leadership.
“She has so much experience, so much composure. She’s had a real calming effect on the team,” Khosroshahin said. “She does her job whether she’s hurt, healthy, sick. You know what she’s going to do, and you can say that for the entire group.”
The other two seniors that will be honored on Senior Day will be midfielder Jamie Petrossi and backup goalkeeper Brittany Massro. Those two, combined with the three starters, have made a lasting impression of the entire team.
“They’ve set an unbelievable precedent for behavior in and out of the classroom and on the training grounds,” Khosroshahin said. “They’ve done an enormous job ensuring discipline is the cornerstone of everything we do and they’ve made some very difficult decisions over the past year to make certain the program’s going to be moving in the right direction after they’re gone.
“It’s up to the rest of us to make certain we send them off on a high note this weekend,” Khosroshahin said.

Parents from all walks of life will descend on the USC campus this weekend. After all, the university expects this to be the largest Parents Weekend ever. Yet, regardless of our differences, there is only one thing that matters.
There are some people who follow USC football, and some who don’t.
Many visitors and parents might feel intimidated or lost by their lack of knowledge as they stand among the Trojan faithful this weekend.
Have no fear, parents. Whether you’ve been living in a cave of isolation or a sea of knowledge, I have everything you need to know about USC football as we reach the official midpoint of the season. After you read this, you should feel comfortable talking to any Trojan fan about the state of USC football.
There is one thing you must understand first and foremost: USC is the best team in the nation. It doesn’t matter that we’re No. 4 in the Coaches’ and AP Polls or that we were screwed by the biggest Ponzi scheme since Bernie Madoff by being ranked No. 7 in the BCS standings. We will take on any and all challengers and beat them to a pulp.
This brings me to my next point. For some inexcusable reason that can only be explained by the movie Angels in the Outfield, we always lose to an inferior Pac-10 team early in the season. Critics like to point to our loss to Washington as a reason to keep us out of the national title game.
But there has not been a BCS national championship game with two undefeated teams since 2006. Every team messes up.
Last year, our mysterious loss came in Corvallis at the hands of Oregon State. During that game, college football’s Muggsy Bogues ran all over our defense (his real name is Jacquizz Rodgers) as USC couldn’t locate him — and when the Trojans did, they couldn’t tackle him.
So if you hear the name Jacquizz, just pop your head into the circle, declare that we will hold him to only 40 yards this year and pop out. If forced to defend your statement, just point to the fact we’ve had a year to prepare for him.
Also, no matter if USC wins or loses, we always end up playing two teams: the opposing school and the officials. Any USC fan that watched the last game at Notre Dame will tell you that the NBA must not be the only league using replacement refs.
Sure, our team likes to have fun and do a little trash talking. But when running back Joe McKnight gets tackled by the ankles right in front of the referee after being five yards out of bounds and it doesn’t get called, or Mays hits someone while he’s clearly still inbounds and gets a late-hit penalty, we know a zebra’s escaped from the zoo.
It’s important to note that USC has the best freshman quarterback ever in Matt Barkley. He got his name in some Heisman talk this week after he passed for 380 yards and two touchdowns against Notre Dame. He also went into the third-biggest college football stadium in the country, Ohio State, in only his second start and led the game-winning fourth quarter drive.
He’s more relaxed than Manny Ramirez and cooler than Coolio. During the Ohio State game, he walked into the huddle smiling and asked, “Isn’t this fun?”
Speaking of fun, our defense is more enjoyable to watch than our offense. In fact, the defense might be better than last year’s unit, and it has eight new starters. USC ranks fourth nationally against the run and didn’t give up a passing touchdown until last week.
Defensive ends Everson Griffen and Nick Perry are among the nation’s leaders in sacks with seven and eight respectively. You do not want to be chased by those guys.
Lastly, even though USC lost one of its top running backs, Stafon Johnson, a few weeks ago because of a freak weightlifting accident — the bar crushed his throat and he can’t speak, but he’s recovering — another running back is the MVP for the first half of the year: Joe McKnight.
McKnight has finally grown out of the “next Reggie Bush” phase and developed into his own player. He dominated that final drive against Ohio State and leads the team with 569 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. Look for No. 4 to get the ball a lot Saturday, as Oregon State is allowing almost 100 rushing yards per game.
That sums up USC’s season so far. Hopefully, you now will no longer feel like the most uninformed person in the Coliseum. But if you find yourself among a crowd tomorrow and can’t remember anything about the USC football team just look around: It’s 80 degrees in late October. Let’s play some football.

I am a huge USC fan but I have to disagree with this article completely. I think USC definitely may be the best team in the country but its not a guarantee. The fact is we lost whereas Texas, Florida, and Alabama are undefeated and have taken care of business by beating the inferior teams they have played. Also, claiming that USC battles the officials is inaccurate. Almost all of the time, it is USC getting the calls in their favor. I have watched my fair share of USC football games and they tend to get the benefit of the doubt because they are USC. Saturday night against Oregon State, I though the officials missed several pass interference calls against USC and gave USC the benefit of the doubt. Notre Dame is the only team in the country that gets every call in every game so that example can’t speak for the entire season.
This article is all of HILARIOUS and TRUE and INFORMATIVE. I love it!!! Reader’s digest status, very appropriate. I commend you.

Ong Bak 2: The Beginning proves that ridiculously awesome and awesomely ridiculous are not interchangeable. Although grand orchestrator Tony Jaa does a striking job with art design and skull-crushing action, the story and one-dimensional characters leave the film soundly in the latter category.
It bites to be an overthrown prince. It burns to be captured as a slave boy. And it really sucks when the bad guy kills your dad. So a kid like Tien (Tony Jaa) is bound to grow up with a few anger issues. Luckily, a bandit king takes him on as a protégé. This Thai version of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves offers Tien a way to settle scores, with as much arm breaking and jaw crunching as possible. Somehow, stampeding elephants and cat women also factor in.
Thai epic · As with 2003’s original, go-to Thai film maven Tony Jaa co-directs, produces, choreographs and stars in Ong Bak 2: The Beginning. The movie follows an overthrown prince on his quest for vengence. - Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
One does not need to have seen 2003’s Ong Bak to understand the sequel. The two have nothing in common beyond martial arts, the Thai language and Tony Jaa.
Ong Bak 2 is Jaa’s baby. He co-directs, he produces, he choreographs and he stars in all the fights. But it is a baby in the vein of Frankenstein’s Monster. With gusto Jaa takes the skeleton of Braveheart, the muscle of MTV and the flesh of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and hits it with several thousand volts of Muay Thai (a form of hard martial art practiced in Southeast Asian countries).
One watches this movie solely for the fights because perceiving Ong Bak 2 as a powerful, 15th-century Thai epic will only work after several Mai Tai cocktails. The Muay Thai fighting, however, makes films like House of Flying Daggers look like frou-frou water ballets.
Instead of pirouetting through kicks and jabs, Tien breaks faces and rips out jugulars. The fights are over the top and epic but still hover on the edge of reality. The sound design, which captures every wet-kitten squelch and tooth-rattling punch, drags the viewer right into the melee with a bag of popcorn. The climactic fight is something we would only see if the WWE did a hostile takeover of the MMA.
Visually, Ong Bak 2 is a brash, burnished extravaganza. The mix of slow-mo and rapid cuts look as if edited by an MTV staffer with aspirations of artistic grandeur. Bejeweled dancers, bedecked warlords and stampeding elements all lend the film an epic flair. The soundtrack trumpets and cheerleads as shamelessly as the one in Pirates of the Caribbean.
All of this creates a beautiful stage for bloodshed and bone breaking. That is the only reason the film exists. Story and character, abstract concepts that can neither slice flesh or snap femurs, serve only as vehicles to carry Tien to the far earthier realm of face stomping.
Tien has the emotional depth of a tide pool and the story could be cut and pasted from any 14-year-old’s Next Big Fantasy Epic. Everything is watery: a flashback to a pretty girl fills the romance quota, a few scenes with the bandit king give us all our heroic tenderness and a treacherous general counts as the plot twist.
One might argue that Ong Bak 2 is all about the fights, and the money dumped into the visuals is just to make them cooler. But any story beyond an uninspired Dungeons and Dragons game might have made us care.
The film pulls off massive fights with minimal CGI and nary a wire, but the lack of emotional attachment keeps the film behind a glass wall. No amount of rousing music and splattering blood can break it. Even an action movie needs a good story or else it is little more than a kid’s afternoon with his G.I. Joes.
Ong Bak 2 is unlikely to go down as the definitive Thai epic. The story is just too shallow and the characters too bland to make a lasting impression.
But it is entertaining. The final fight is a brilliant work of choreography that will have anyone seeing why the Romans loved their gladiators. And Tony Jaa, when it comes to staging fights, is his own kind of artist.
View Ong Bak 2 only as a grand piece of gladiatorial combat with waves of enemies, hundreds of kinds of weapons and no meaningful conclusion — then you won’t leave the theater feeling like your intelligence was insulted.

Entering into the final five weeks of its season, the men’s water polo team hopes to complete its non-conference schedule with a match against No. 6 Loyola Marymount on Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The Lions (13-5, 8-0), lead the Western Water Polo Association and come to McDonald’s on a two-game winning streak, including a 10-9 overtime victory over UC Santa Barbara to give LMU seventh place at the SoCal tournament. The Lions are also 10-5 against ranked opponents this season, and as leaders of the WWPA, are possible NCAA opponents for the Trojans if they are to make it that far.
Goalie’s game · Coming off a 12-save outing against Long Beach State, USC goalkeeper Joel Dennerley faces a major challenge in Loyola Marymount’s Edgaras Asajavicius, who leads the Lions with 33 goals this year. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“Anytime you play teams like LMU, Princeton or Navy, you look forward to those matches, because if we make it to the NCAAs, these are possible opponents,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “They’re also very well coached and very talented.”
Much of the Lions’ success can be attributed to a stingy defense that has given up 5.71 goals per game previous to Thursday’s loss, good enough for third in the nation. Last year’s third team All-American and WWPA Goalie of the Year Andy Stevens heads the defense. Stevens’ 13.44 saves per game ranks him second in the nation and provides a big challenge for the Trojan attack.
“[Stevens] is very athletic, and he does a very good job in anticipating shots,” Vavic said. “He also has a lot of experience, especially playing for the junior national team.”
The Lion offense presents a challenge for the Trojans as well. It is led by driver Edgaras Asajavicius who paces the team with 33 goals. USC will counter with sophomore goalie Joel Dennerley, who was named MPSF Player of the Week following the Trojans’ 9-4 victory over Long Beach State last Saturday in which Dennerley had a season-high 12 saves.
“In games he just dominates, not many people can score on him. His [6-foot-11-inch] reach makes it really hard to score on him,” redshirt freshman goalie Will Simon said.
The two squads faced off earlier this season at the Triton Invitational, with the Trojans prevailing 11-6. They were to hold Asajavicius scoreless while taking advantage of the opportunities against the tough Stevens. The victory at the Triton ran USC’s all-time record against the Lions to 16-0, but the team knows the past has little bearing on what LMU will bring to the pool on Saturday.
“It’s a blank slate. Every game is a new game for us,” Simon said. “We don’t go in thinking about how we beat them this many times in this many years. It’s not important to us.”
USC will also be looking to its current 10-game winning streak after losing to UCLA in the semifinals of the NorCal tournament more than a month ago. Another victory would also increase the Trojans’ home winning streak to 37 games.

USC is partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to uncover the cause behind several water main breaks that have been flooding the city’s streets.
The project will be led by Jean-Pierre Bardet, director of USC’s Center on Megacities and chair of the Viterbi Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Additionally, experts from across the country will help look for patterns in the breaks and consider solutions, Bardet said.

“USC was chosen because we have the Center on Megacities, an organized search unit approved by the Provost office,” he said. “We deal with issues related to urban systems, which is relevant to the water main breaks.”
Bardet and the other partners will be meeting with LADWP personnel and measuring water pipe data, such as the pipes’ ages, diameters and thicknesses, to identify the cause of the breaks and try to predict future ones.
“The main reason for the water breaks is probably that they’re old and corroded,” said Andrea Donnellan, JPL’s principal investigator. “We’re using radar to see if there are ground motions and any strong [fault] activity,” which Donnellan said could be another possible explanation for the breaks.
Motion along faults has been deviating from the normal range in the last 100 days, which could be a cause for the breaks, JPL officials said. The motions are not the faults themselves, but are fault-controlled, Donnellan said.
JPL had been studying recent fault activity because of the large number of minor earthquakes that hit Southern California over the summer. Then it was contacted by LADWP and decided to help, she added.
Cornell University is also contributing to the project by providing a computer simulation system that allows USC researches to analyze stresses on the water main structures.
The team is also considering other theories for the breaks, such as the city’s ordinance limiting outdoor water usage to only Mondays and Thursdays. Bardet said the added water pressure on aging pipes during the rest of the week could be behind the breaks.
“We’re trying not to speculate,” Bardet said. “We’re looking for the facts and trying to give solutions.”
The results of the water main project could also have an impact on overall water usage in Los Angeles.
“It’s like looking at the tip of an iceberg,” Bardet said. “We can use that to find something more profound, which may end up affecting how we use water.”
Bardet said the team’s efforts could also reveal data about water distribution that has the potential to affect cities everywhere.
“The problem is not specific to Los Angeles, but to cities across the country,” Bardet said.
Frictional heating may be the cause here. See http://www.quakeprediction.com for a possible 6.0-7.0 earthquake before November 15th.

James Bond and archenemy Ernst Blofeld meet for a tense discussion of global espionage. Their guns are holstered, but their hands are ready to draw. At the emotional high point of the confrontation, we cut jarringly to M giving his reaction to the whole affair.
This Bond versus Blofeld scene might sound like a parody out of 30 Rock, but just imagine what James Bond could become now that Peter Morgan is filling in as the scribe.
Talk back · Morgan’s talent as a screenwriter falters only momentarily during the climax of 2008’s Frost/Nixon. - Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures
Morgan is the screenwriter behind two of the most acclaimed films of recent years: The Queen and Frost/Nixon. His style is low-key, pulling short, essential moments from modern history and turning them into personal dramas about the conflict between two opposing forces.
He certainly is good at what he does. His two screenplays that strayed from his successful formula — The Last King of Scotland and The Other Boleyn Girl — are significantly less memorable, but The Queen and Frost/Nixon were Oscar-nominated for a reason.
The Damned United, Morgan’s latest film, is currently enjoying a modest run in a few Los Angeles theaters. The story of a legendary British football manager’s disastrous tenure as head of the famous Leeds United in 1974, the film arrives with the sports movie tag that often indicates clichés.
As with his other historical dramas, however, Morgan’s latest never takes the expected angle. At its heart, The Damned United is essentially a character study about three very different men — Michael Sheen’s Brian Clough, his assistant coach Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) and his bitter rival Don Revie (Colm Meaney). The script is his most ambitious and manipulative, moving effortlessly between 1974 and the preceding years to develop Clough’s obsession with Revie while constantly changing our perception of the protagonist.
As part of the reason why Morgan’s films are consistently the best-acted pieces around, Sheen deserves special mention. Sheen played essential supporting roles in The Queen and Frost/Nixon, and The Damned United represents his first chance to break out of the bounce-board mode and into a genuine starring role. As the egomaniacal, obsessive, intensely likeable Clough, Sheen delivers — and it’s unfortunate that we’ve entered the season where this begins to lose all meaning — one of the best performances of the year.
For Morgan’s films, the X-factor is inevitably the director. Stephen Frears, one of the very best un-ambitious filmmakers working in the industry, filmed The Queen in perfect teleplay style, using digital cameras to make almost everything look not quite cinematic. Far inferior is the bland stylistic morass of Ron Howard’s Frost/Nixon, full of flashy shots that favor of tables, cameras, chairs — everything except characters.
Tom Hooper, the relative unknown at the helm of The Damned United, gives the film a gritty look that well suits the subject matter. The film isn’t really about the actual game of football, but Morgan and Hooper perfectly understand and express the love-bordering-on-fanaticism that men like Clough feel for the game.
It’s easy to praise Morgan’s style because it is so conducive to well-directed, brilliantly acted character studies. Morgan’s latest film as screenwriter, however, suffers from the same problems inherent in that low-key documentary style that diminished the impact of The Queen and Frost/Nixon.
In The Queen, Morgan cuts away at the film’s most crucial moment, Queen Elizabeth’s televised apology to the British people. Helen Mirren won every acting award around for that role partially because she never, ever chews the scenery. Still, Morgan robs the moment the film builds to for an hour and a half of its force by refusing to allow Mirren to give the entire speech.
In Frost/Nixon, Morgan used sharp cutaways to quasi-documentary interviews of the characters reflecting on the action, a cheap tactic meant to inscribe the viewer’s mind with emotional instructions.
In the climax of that almost excellent film, also an apology by a head of state, Morgan takes the audience away from the action at the key emotional beat, jarring us with historical significance to erase the emotional impact. Curiously, those cuts are present in his original play, and it is curious that a playwright wouldn’t understand the importance of letting a scene play out without interruption.
In The Damned United, both Morgan and Sheen play Clough’s relationship with Revie with a degree of ambiguity. The film’s powerhouse climax — a side-by-side interview between the two coaches — suggests that Revie might not actually be a bad man and that the source of Clough’s obsession, which drives the film, is merely his own insecurities, a powerful statement about the character and sports figures in general.
Unfortunately, Morgan blows it in the final frames, mocking Revie’s later failures with a few obnoxious epilogue title frames, firmly establishing Clough as the hero and his rival as the villain. It dampens the impact that Morgan and Sheen worked so hard to create.
Regardless of that particular miscue, The Damned United is one of the year’s best, thanks to the usual combination of Morgan’s character writing ability and the acting of British regulars.
Morgan’s next film will return Sheen to the role of Tony Blair, a figure he has played so exceptionally in the past, sitting across from Dennis Quaid as Bill Clinton. Rumors are also swirling around Sheen as primary Bond antagonist Ernst Blofeld for the Morgan’s Bond 23, but that speculation seems about as valid as Johnny Depp playing the Riddler in the next Batman film.
Still, the Morgan-Sheen connection has people talking, and putting a talented screenwriter not named Paul Haggis — that hack who helped script Casino Royale — behind a major Hollywood franchise yield some fresh results.

Welcome to the newest installation of computer-generated animation.
Recall the 1980s when American kids would gather around the television to watch Astro Boy, a popular crossover series from Japan that featured a little robot boy with a heart of gold and the ability to kick some poetic justice.
Brain child · Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) voices Astro, the main character in Summit Entertainment’s latest animated feature, Astro Boy. The film is adapted from the popular Japanese manga series-turned-TV show of the same name, which was created by Osamu Tezuka in 1952. - Photo courtesy of Summit Entertainment
Decades later, Astro Boy is back with a modern twist. But whether or not the new-and-improved Astro has enough strength to maintain the series’ staying power is questionable.
Released by Summit Entertainment, the same production company that created us the Twilight series, Astro Boy attempts to adapt an international anime heavyweight. Considered a pop culture icon in Japan, Astro Boy originated in the 1950s by manga artist Osamu Tezuka and has since gained enormous popularity spawning various television shows throughout the years.
Does the latest installment maintain its level of grandeur?
Maybe.
Astro Boy is set in a place called Metro City, a floating island in the Earth’s atmosphere where the last remnants of human society remain. As a result, robots take care of the needs of the humans left. But no matter how civilized the robots may be, they are treated as second-class citizens with little respect.
The film follows Dr. Tenma, a genius scientist, and his son Toby, who is killed in a tragic accident. In enraged grief, Dr. Tenma creates a robotic version of his son, Astro, that happens to have the latest installment of modern defense technologies. But Dr. Tenma realizes that no one, not even a loveable, incredibly life-like robot made out of purely blue positive energy can replace his son, and he exiles Astro. This is quite a blow to Astro, who believes he is human. Outcast, he meets other characters that help him appreciate friendship as well as his own identity.
The film’s animation is stellar — that much is undeniable. Once you enter into the world of Astro Boy, the audience is thrust into the next generation of animation and some of the images are so incredibly colorful they become somewhat reminiscent of psychedelia.
But while the awe-inspiring and sometimes just-darn-cute animation is an added plus, the dialogue is, well, a little too G-rated. Though at times the story is clever enough to entertain an adult, at others it can be enough to make the same adult cringe from the over-simplified dialogue. It drags on a little too long at moments and struggle to achieve the balance between loveably campy and moronically simple.
While the cast is made up of many big names, including Kristen Bell, Nathan Lane, Bill Nighy and Nicolas Cage, it seems that in this case names can either be a plus or a big giant minus. And if you replace big giant minus with Nicolas Cage that’s exactly what you get.
Ah, Nic Cage. Though it appears he did genuinely have talent at some point (evident from his possession of an Oscar), he has once again proved himself wrong.
His performance, which is usually painful enough with his actual appearance on screen, becomes excruciating in animated form when his emotionless line delivery isn’t paired up with an empty blank stare. Let’s just say that in the pivotal scene of his son’s death his delivery of, “Where’s my son?” could have very well been replaced with, “Where’s the pizza?”
The film does have its flaws, but it doesn’t fall completely flat. Overall, the film has a decent story line and interesting characters. Freddie Highmore’s performance of Astro is delightful and inviting, while comic relief comes in the form of Bell’s Cora as well as Lane’s Ham Egg. But perhaps the best performance comes from Dr. Elefun. It is no easy feat to communicate emotion solely through the use of your voice, but Nighy’s performance was so genuine that at times it was easy to forget it was coming out of a cartoon character.
Though Astro Boy is an enjoyable romp through colorful computer animation, one can’t help but wonder if a makeover of this beloved character and series was necessary. Some things are simply better left untouched.

Word on the street is that after seeing Paranormal Activity, Steven Spielberg returned to the studio with the DVD in a trash bag. He claimed the door to his bedroom locked by itself after he watched the film. Was it the ghost of Orson Welles, still upset over Spielberg’s adaptation of War of the Worlds?
Truthfully, I would be more scared of Welles’ glowering specter than Paranormal Activity.
Haunted · Young couple Micah and Katie (Micah Sloat and Katie Featherson) set up high-end video equipment to film the antics of a ghost that has followed Katie since childhood. The movie is in limited release. - Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures
One of the latest horror film to hit theaters, Paranormal Activity centers around a young couple, Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), who are struggling with relationship problems. Not with each other, but with the ghost that seems to have followed Katie since childhood. Tech-happy Micah sees it as the perfect excuse to invest in a high-end video camera and record their bedroom at night.
The film, shot home-video style, follows the couple as the bumps in the night go from swishing doors to burning Ouiji boards to an all-out demonic frenzy.
Yet Paranormal Activity is all foreplay. It’s a sardonic, effective buildup but the main event — when the ghostie decides to stop faffing about and get down to business — just sort of fizzles. This is disappointing, considering how effective the original buildup is.
Director Oren Peli is at his best with the nighttime scenes. He taps into a potent fear — what happens when we are asleep, completely unaware and defenseless. Each creak and shadow carries a menace. Every night is like a roller coaster, carefully tailored to build and dip, with each night growing longer and each encounter more dangerous.
But other plot elements, while intended to be creepy, turn to silliness after a few moments of cognizant thought. For example, Micah finds a picture of Katie in the attic above their bed. Did it just fall out of the demon’s wallet? But to Paranormal Activity’s credit, the event is creepy in the moment. It’s after the scene that reality kicks in.
While the characters were supposed to be organic and natural, they are not always convincing or likeable. Micah is unlikable from the get-go. While his cockiness is understandable at first, he would have to have a cheesesteak for a brain not to be freaked out sooner. As the film goes on, the real mystery is not our ghostie, but why Katie still lives with this mook who puts her in danger by calling out the demon.
Katie is usually more believable and quite pitiable. She has the lungs of a horror champ and skillfully moves from anger to terror. She and Sloat do have genuine chemistry that comes through far better in the horror parts than the connecting daytime parts.
In fact, the divide is a major buzzkill of the film. When things stay in the bedroom, it’s creepy and decently acted. When things aren’t going bump in the night, the acting borders on cringe-worthy. Perhaps improvising is easier when the leading emotions are fear. Borrowing from The Blair Witch Project, the film never had a script — Peli would outline a scene and let the actors take it from there.
The film has several pools for potential creepy and should have dipped into them more. For instance, in most films, the ghost is just defending its cave. No matter how bad things get, the protagonist can always just leave (barring an overdone plot twist).
But in Paranormal Activity, the spirit is attached to Katie, not the house. No matter how far she runs, it will follow. Thus, the film could have done far more with the daytime scenes. As it is, the only daylight terror is the home’s Ikea invasion. What few story elements the film tries to introduce, such as Katie’s past, could be far more potent.
Paramount has tried hard with a sleeper-hit marketing campaign. The company ran Internet polls to find audience interest and based screenings accordingly. Now, the Internet interest abuzz, the film is opening wide. But it was not always so. Originally, Spielberg did not even want to use Peli’s film, but instead create a Hollywood remake that Peli could direct. Only after a test screening did they decide to stick with the original.
Remember, while marketing plants might clamor that Spielberg thought the DVD was cursed, Spielberg never said anything about the film actually scaring him.
Paranormal Activity is not the worst horror movie to come out this year. It’s not even bad. But the people who say they lost sleep over it most likely did not get enough Wes Craven in their childhoods.

Last week at a town hall meeting in Louisiana, fourth-grader Tyren Scott asked President Barack Obama, “Why do people hate you?” Obama smiled.
There was no chink in his armor. It was a loaded question, yet Obama answered in stride. He told Tyren that he still had a lot of supporters and that people must stay strong in the face of adversity.
That was the answer he was supposed to give. But I can’t help but wonder what Obama really wanted to say to his critics if he could face them in a private setting, rather than field questions from a fourth grader. How would Obama respond if instead of Tyren, an adult was telling him why they hated him?
The following are actual comments from people on why they hate Obama, left on message boards. The responses are not.
CRITIC 1: “Mr. President, the people hate you because you’re trying to take everything away from them and give them only a little back, even though these people work their tails off to get by.”
OBAMA: “I understand why you might think I’m taking from the middle and lower class. I know there are plenty of reasons to be upset with me right now. I realize the Rasmussen Report shows 39 percent of voters strongly disapprove with my decisions, with just reason.
“No one likes hearing the words ‘federal deficit’ and ‘record high’ in the same sentence, but the deficit has reached $1.42 trillion in an effort to save our banks and auto companies from sinking. I do promise to target this rampant spending, but recovering from the recession is top priority right now.
“I also understand that it’s frustrating to hear all the misleading claims about the economy turning around when unemployment still hovers at 9.5 percent, with states like California sitting at 12.2 percent, but until the economy stabilizes, those numbers will remain high and so will spending. I am not trying to rob you. I’m trying to save your jobs.”
CRITIC 2: “Barack Hussein Obama, the people hate you because of the socialist agenda you’re pushing.”
OBAMA: “I feel like socialist is the new commie. It’s just a way to attack me when you don’t agree with what I’m doing. It’s like when the media calls me Barack Hussein Obama when they’re being critical of me. It’s an attempt to associate me with Saddam without looking guilty. Certainly it’s my middle name, but I know what they’re really trying to do.
“As for my socialist agenda, the government isn’t currently making decisions for Goldman Sachs or General Motors or mandating everyone buy our healthcare. I think you’ve been misinformed.”
CRITIC 3: “All of middle-class America hates you because you’re a self-absorbed, self-centered, narcissistic, liberal, socialist, Marxist who cares only about your ideological vision of a socialist Marxist state, not America.”
OBAMA: “Next.”
CRITIC 4: “We hate you because you lied about our troops.”
OBAMA: “That’s fair. I realize how difficult it is wondering every night about when you’re going to see your loved ones again, but I also worry about our troops overseas. That’s why I haven’t yet approved Gen. Stanley McChrystal’s request for 40,000 more troops.
“I can’t fulfill that request until the Afghanistan election sorts itself out. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, agrees that until a formal government is in place, our troops need to stay home.
I know this isn’t comforting for the 68,000 troops already there, but to bring them back early while the Afghanistan people still need help and while the Taliban still remains a threat to our country, would jeopardize everyone’s safety.”
CRITIC 5: “Mr. President, the public hates you because you lied about Guantanamo Bay.”
OBAMA: “I understand your sentiments. I was wrong in promising to shut down Guantanamo Bay by next January. I admit that. I realize now that the deadline is too soon. My defense secretary, Robert Gates, and I prematurely agreed on a date to comfort the nation, without considering the difficulties we would face from our own senators.
“Everyone agrees that the detainees need to be moved, but no one wants to take them in. Republican Kansas senators  Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts opposed bringing them in to their state prisons, yet Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), whose state actually released prisoners early in a cost saving effort, is willing to bring in detainees. How is that possible?
It’s just like I said at a recent fundraiser in San Francisco, it’s time to grab a mop and help clean up the mess. We don’t want somebody sitting back saying you’re not holding the mop right. Help us out. It’s not a one-man show.”
Robert Fragoza is a junior majoring in chemical engineering. His column, “Reality Check,” runs Fridays.
I love it when liberal writers daydream about being Obama and what would they say if they were him, but I like it because it’s ridiculous and makes the writer look like an idiot. Which may not be what you were aiming for. A better way to respond to this story would be to come up with a list of your own humorous reasons why people hate Obama. For example, one of the great conservative political humorists on the web came up with this one: http://www.imao.us/index.php/2009/10/why-people-hate-barack-obama/
My favorite: “He DIDN’T really caboose-check that Brazillian chick. Is he a freakin’ eunuch?”
B. Hussein Obama!
Okay, Robert. Now do the same for President Bush. Because liberals still get all foamy-at-the-mouth about their hatred for him, but every single decision for which he is criticized has a calm and rational answer… even if you don’t agree with the answers. Even if the answers are fantasy/wrong/lies — even as some of Obama’s “answers” you wrote, above, clearly are wrong, misguided, or deceitful.
Brilliantly refreshing piece of rationality here. What I wouldn’t give for this situation to actually occur.

It often feels as if the heads of the media empire spend the majority of their afternoons lounging languidly in their plush office chairs, staring out a window while remembering the good ol’ days. After all, the entertainment business reached its height many years ago. Right?
How else can we explain this unrelenting surge in the creation of mediocre remakes and sequels to beloved classics? Bad sequels are nothing new in Hollywood. Hello, Terminator: Salvation, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian and just about every other film with a long-winded title released in the tired months of summer.
We all expect the overpaid executives in Hollywood to dig desperately around in our pockets to extract our loose change. What was not anticipated, however, was that the titans of the book industry would take drastic and sudden moves to follow suit.
Sequels of novels are to be expected; in fact, many series require multiple books to tell their sweeping tales. But when a series is raised from the dead many years after the passing of its original author, the fresh creativity that made the original so popular begins to sour.
Recently, many beloved and critically acclaimed book series have been given new life by those seeking to profit from the original author’s brilliance.
Many readers in our generation are familiar with Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series. Eight years after Adams’ death, author Eoin Colfer of the Artemis Fowl series has been given permission by Adams’ estate to write And Another Thing… Why bother? No matter how good the book is, it is simply not the same.
In addition, the great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker, Dacre Stoker, has teamed up with Ian Holt (a Dracula documentarian) to create a sequel to Bram’s timeless novel Dracula, titled Dracula the Un-Dead.
The timing of the book’s release is suspiciously convenient, considering our current cultural obsession with vampires made popular by Twilight and True Blood.
There seems to be no reason to create a sequel to this literary staple, except perhaps to capitalize on the appeal of vampires and turn a predictably hefty profit. After all, Stoker’s last name automatically lends the novel the weight of authority, whether the book is any good or not.
Perhaps the most upsetting sequel rip-off arrived just a couple weeks ago. Dutton Children’s Books released the first authorized sequel to A.A. Milne’s iconic Winnie the Pooh series, which were first published in the 1920s. The book is titled, Return to the Hundred Acre Wood.
There is an inherent sanctity in classic works such as the stories of beloved little Pooh bear, and they should not be tampered with. The series was a symbol of its time, the imaginings of an individual author who sought to capture a spirit of his culture that ending up resonating with millions.
Imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery, but no matter how eager new scribe David Benedictus may be in his attempt to recreate Milne’s tone, it will never be the same. Lightning does not strike the same place twice.
The fact that the new book tries so desperately to recreate the spirit of the original is what makes it so unpalatable. Benedictus, you are not Milne. Go back to writing your own books.
Artists should not be striving to benefit from the work of others. They should be seeking out new stories, new concepts and new ways of expressing them. Our culture cannot hope to reach new heights by running through the same material over and over, hoping that it will somehow achieve timely artistic influence by rehashing the works of those before us.
Real artists do not recycle. They create. These books became icons because of their authors’ originality – we need to make sure we will have new influential works of our own to pass down future generations.
Amy Baack is a senior majoring in cinema-television production.
It seems to me that these authors who try to recreate classical series, or try to continue a big hit story are not at a loss of ideas for their own books, but have lost the essance of being an author and are left with the greed for fame and money.

The No. 6 USC women’s golf team will utilize its third straight different lineup this weekend at the University of North Carolina Women’s Fall Preview.
The three-day event, which will take place at the Country Club of Landfall’s Pete Dye Course this Friday, Saturday and Sunday in Wilmington, N.C., features the season debut of returning senior All-American Stephanie Endstrasser for the Women of Troy.
Endstrasser, a native of Austria, transferred to USC from Purdue for the spring semester of her sophomore year and instantly became a fixture in the lineup. She placed in the top 16 in five of her seven tournaments, peaking with a third place finish at the 2008 NCAA Championships West Regional, and was named a Second-Team All-American.
Her junior year, however, was plagued by inconsistency, with a third place finish at the 2008 Mason Rudolph Championship being her only finish in the top 30. She only made the roster for six of the team’s 12 tournaments, and did not play in the conference, regional or national championships, having been beaten out of a spot by then-freshman Inah Park and then-junior Caroline Kim.
Endstrasser looks to bounce back and become a consistent part of the lineup again.
“This is my first time traveling with the team in a long time, and I decided to keep my expectations low,” she said.
Endstrasser spent the offseason at home attending summer school while playing golf every day, but only played in two tournaments. This tournament is her first competitive event in months.
“I just want to go out there and have fun,” she said. “I hope I’ll be a part of the competitive roster for the rest of the season.”
To do that, she’ll have to beat out some of her teammates this week, including returning All-Americans Belen Mozo and Lizette Salas, as well as Kim and Park. Mozo is playing her second tournament this season following shoulder surgery over the summer, and Salas is returning to the competitive roster after missing the last tournament to attend a wedding. Kim and Park have both competed at the first two events of the season.
Endstrasser’s return to form would give the Trojans seven golfers to fill five roster spots, and would give coach Andrea Gaston the depth she was hoping would be provided in the fall season. This tournament is especially crucial in developing depth, as the National Championship will be held in the same location in June 2010.
Other teams scouting out the course include No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 Arizona State, No. 3 Purdue and four other teams from the top 10.

Winning these games is crucial for the Women of Troy, as they are coming into the game with a four-game losing streak. Now that they are back at the Galen Center, the Women of Troy look to break that streak and come up with two wins that are crucial to their standing in the Pac-10.
Oregon State is coming into the game Friday in a situation similar to that of USC’s. Losing last weekend in a four-set game against No. 5 Stanford and being swept by then-No. 14 Cal, the Beavers are now 2-5 in Pac-10 play.
They are averaging 13.3 kills per set this season and 2.9 blocks per set, ranking them second among Pac-10 teams for blocks and fourth for digs. The Beavers’ senior outside hitter Rachel Rourke leads the team with 4.59 kills per set and 372.5 points.
USC has led the all-time series against Oregon State by a 38-8 margin, winning 23 of the last 24 matches against the Beavers.
Oregon comes into Saturday’s game after sweeping Cal at home and crushing then-No.5 Stanford after a five set match, which was the Ducks’ first victory against the Cardinal since 1989.
The Ducks are averaging 14.54 kills per set and 2.55 blocks per set, and are leading the Pac-10 in serving aces with 117. They are second in the conference in hitting percentage at .296. The Ducks’ junior outside hitter Heather Meyers is first in the Pac-10 with a 0.63 serving aces per set average.
The Women of Troy also lead the all-time series with Oregon by a 41-8 margin.
USC’s sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter is leading the Women of Troy with 4.38 kills per set, and 5.17 points per set, and is 10th in the nation for those points per set and tied for third among Pac-10 players. Sophomore setter Kendall Bateman is fifth in the nation in assists with 12.05 per set.
The Women of Troy play Oregon State on Friday at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center, and will play Oregon on Saturday at 2 p.m.

Senior Stephanie Garcia is the first in her family to attend college. She began at Los Angeles Community College, and transferred to USC in her sophomore year with the help of the SCholars program — a program that helps first-generation and low-income students transfer to four-year universities.
Since coming to USC, Garcia has been actively involved with the SCholars program, even bringing her younger sister to events with her. She hopes the events will eventually inspire her sister to attend a four-year school.
SCholarly · Juana Escobar, a junior majoring in communication, transferred from Los Angeles City College through the SCholars program. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
But unless the program manages to quickly raise hundreds of thousands of dollars, Garcia’s sister might not have the same opportunity.
“If I wouldn’t have known and been a part of the SCholars, I would’ve still been struggling,” Garcia said. “They helped with a lot of the challenges we face as transfer students, but also as a lot of first-generation college students. A lot of us did have a hard time transferring, academically and socially, and they’ve definitely been there to help bridge that gap.”
The SCholars program was established at USC in 2006, spurred by a grant of almost $1 million. But the money, given by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, was a one-time grant. Now that the funds from the grant have run out, the program’s future is in jeopardy.
The program takes about $200,000-$250,000 per year to run, according to Judi Garbuio, associate dean of the Academic Recognition and Scholars Program. The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, in the midst of financial difficulty, has said it will not renew the grant, so the SCholars program is looking for an alternative source of funding.
“We’re working on it, trying to seek funds from other foundations, and we’ve also been engaged in fundraising from private parties willing to support the cause,” said K.C. Mmeje, the SCholars program director. “We’re trying to get the university to see that what we’re doing is important enough for them to provide support to sustain the program, but we’re not seeing that right now.”
Because the program has been funded entirely by sources outside of USC so far, it is looking to other external sources first. Garbuio said asking USC for funding would be a last resort, because they are aware of the many other programs aiming to get money from the university. She was not optimistic about other sources of funding, either.
“It’s a very tough time to be fundraising,” Garbuio said. “Different individuals have suffered with the economy, so they’re not as likely to donate to foundations, which are in turn not as likely to give out grants.”
Like Garcia, Roland Zapata, a junior majoring in psychology and a member of the SCholars program, said the program has been a defining part of his educational experience and hopes that it finds a way to stay afloat.
“It’s a transition program, essentially, it’s a baby-step thing, perfect for someone like me,” Zapata said. “I was asking all these weird questions and I was getting answers.”
The SCholars program offers students counseling resources and group events to help them succeed socially and academically.
“Without it, who knows if I would’ve even ended up here,” Zapata said. “People say that as a joke, ‘Who knows where I’d be,’ but really. Even once I got here, it’s been a big jump from community college … Even if I had gotten here without it, without that support to fall back on, I would’ve been like, ‘OK, I’m dropping this, I’m out.’”
Cheryl Armstrong, director of the University Transfer Center at Los Angeles City College, said the program is important to students and believes that it should be a priority for it to continue to function.
“If I had a pot of money set aside, this would be a priority in terms of making sure this program continues,” she said. “Students who go through this specific program tend to apply to select universities, tend to enroll and complete the work and go on to graduate school. It provides the transition information that students need who might not have succeeded otherwise.”
The grant from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation extends through August 2010, so students currently in community colleges entering USC next year will still go through the SCholar program’s summer immersion session.
The immersion program, however, will put more emphasis on pointing out resources on campus they can turn to in case the SCholars office is available next fall.
Still, Garbuio said she believes in the program.
“I’m still hopeful,” she said. “I really believe it’s a fantastic program, and that we’ll figure out a way to keep it going.”
It’s about time they cut off the welfare.

USC Hospitality says student feedback will be a major factor in determining what happens to The Lot and in what restaurants are given space in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Hospitality, with the help of the Undergraduate Student Government, has begun gauging student interest in restaurants that could occupy the Campus Center.
Not a lot · The future of The Lot, which features popular restaurants such as Baja Fresh and Wolfgang Puck, is still up in the air. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Hospitality is also debating what to do with The Lot, which was originally designed to be a temporary structure during construction on the campus center.
But Kris Klinger, the newly appointed director of USC Hospitality, said The Lot could remain if there is a use for it.
Klinger said if The Lot does stay, it will likely not be used for food services. But he said he wasn’t ruling anything out.
“The plan is not to continue to cook and serve food there, but that could always change,” Klinger said. “We won’t say never.”
Klinger said he would consider keeping The Lot if a student group approached Student Affairs or himself with an exceptional idea for how to use the space, whether it be as a study hall or meeting place.
The other option, he said, would be to rent out the space, which USC Hospitality owns, to an outside vendor.
“What we’re going to do with The Lot will be somewhat determined by groups and folks that are interested in it. We’ll see how things go over the next few months,” Klinger said.
John Baldo, the USG director of university affairs, said if USC Hospitality decides to keep The Lot, USG will also seek student feedback on how it should be used.
“We’re just waiting to hear if The Lot will stand, and then we’ll look at recommendations for that. At the moment, we’re rather unclear about it,” Baldo said.
Though no decisions have been made, Klinger said the chances of keeping The Lot are slim.
“More than likely it will close, and it will be a parking lot again or something else,” he said.
Ari Eryorulmaz, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said he did not see a reason to keep The Lot.
“It should be destroyed,” he said. “It’s ugly.”
Babak Oskouei, a fourth year graduate student studying aerospace and mechanical engineering, cited the noise inside The Lot, not aesthetics, as one reason The Lot frustrates him.
“It’s good USC is providing food in the middle of campus, but I prefer to get my food and then sit outside,” he said. “It’s pretty noisy even when just a few people are in there.”
If The Lot closed, some of its restaurants could be relocated to the new Campus Center or to Café 84, according to Klinger.
USG and the Graduate and Professional Students Senate distributed a survey last week to assess student interest in restaurants that could end up in the Campus Center.
The 20 restaurants listed on the survey were chosen by Hospitality as the top contenders for spots in the Campus Center. The list includes familiar names such as Carl’s Jr., Red Mango, Wolfgang Puck and Baja Fresh — all restaurants currently in The Lot.
Based on the results, Hospitality will decide whether or not to renew its contracts with the restaurants currently in The Lot.
“I think all of those restaurants came in wanting to show us what they were capable of doing if they weren’t already on campus so they could stay,” Klinger said, noting that the restaurants in The Lot have proven popular.
Much to Eryorulmaz and Oskouei’s chagrin, In-N-Out Burger was absent from the list of new options.
Klinger said though the university was interested in an agreement, In-N-Out was not because of its aversion to franchising. Baldo added that the popular West Coast haunt also requires a drive-through, and USC has no building that can support one.
Instead, Five Guys, a burger joint more popular on the East Coast, was presented as an option. Other choices included Panda Express, California Pizza Kitchen and Chick-fil-A.
“If there are enough students interested [in a restaurant], we’ll look into it,” Klinger said.
Klinger said he has already been in communication with some of the restaurants, but is waiting for feedback from students.
That feedback should be available soon, as Baldo said he expects to wrap up the student survey Friday. Hospitality will base a lot of its decisions on the survey results.
“No one has signed contracts and no one is locked in yet, so they’re really going to be listening to us,” Baldo said.

On the wall of Trojan Marching Band Director Arthur Bartner’s office hangs a photograph of an 800-piece band packed on the grass of the Coliseum in the shape of the United States.
As 2.5 billion people from across the world watched, the band — including 150 members from USC — played for the Opening Ceremony in the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, under Bartner’s guiding hands. Twenty-five years later, Bartner is still leading the self-titled “Greatest Marching Band in the History of the Universe,” marking his 40th year at the helm this year.
His forte · Art Bartner, director of the Trojan Marching Band, has been with the Spirit of Troy for 40 years and has led the band through 16 Rose Bowls and two platinum albums. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“He is the Spirit of Troy, believe me,” said Brad Calhoun, former Voice of Troy — the pre-game and half-time announcer at Trojan football games. “The band had humble beginnings, and he transformed it into one of the best.”
Bartner, who hails from New Jersey, came to USC in 1970 after playing the trumpet in the University of Michigan marching band for four years and working as a high school band director.
Back then, the band was having a hard time getting gigs with well-known musicians and did not have enough money for its budget.
“Art was 30 years old when he started,” Calhoun said. “[But] Art had a vision, and the longevity and consistency of service allowed him to implement his vision to the benefit of the university and its alums.”
At first, Bartner tried to model the marching band after his alma mater’s, but he said the highly disciplined style at Michigan did not work at USC.
“USC students wanted their own style, so I developed a new style with help from the students and [former USC football player and assistant coach] Marv Goux,” he said.
Bartner had met Goux, whom he calls a Trojan icon, shortly after he started working at USC, and ended up leaning on him for advice.
“Goux took me under his wing and showed me how to be a Trojan,” Bartner said.
Bartner said Goux, who died in 2002, encouraged him to go to football practices and watch the defensive linemen practice. Watching Goux work, Bartner said, made it easy for him to see the Trojan values of spirit, enthusiasm, competitiveness and intensity in action.
“I try and bring those qualities to the band,” said Bartner.
Thirty-one years later, when newly hired football coach Pete Carroll went to Goux to learn about Trojan tradition, Goux told Carroll to seek out Bartner.
“Dr. Bartner basically taught Pete Carroll how to be a Trojan,” said Brett Padelford, the band’s public relations director and a former Spirit of Troy trumpet player. “They’ll do anything for each
other.”
The connection between the band and the football team is something that both band members and alumni say is unique to USC.
“The band and football team took off together when Pete came,” said Kenny Morris, a senior majoring in sociology and the band’s drum major. “Dr. Bartner looks to Pete Carroll a lot for inspiration.”
Likewise, Carroll says he too considers Bartner a source of motivation.
“I have so much respect for the work he does … The passion he’s always stood for has withstood all the years he’s been here,” Carroll said. “He’s demonstrated to the football team that there’s no reason you have to fluctuate your performances. Their performances have always been absolutely consistent.”
The band has not missed a
football home or away game since 1987, and the entire group travels to both the USC-Notre Dame game and the Weekender, when USC plays either at Stanford or University of California, Berkeley.
“We are very much a football band,” Bartner said. “Everything we do is geared to that team. The team is never far from our mind.”
In addition to performing every week, Bartner’s career at the school spans 16 Rose Bowl performances, three Super Bowl performances, three Academy Awards appearances and two platinum albums. His tenure has also started several traditions, including the Lone Ranger theme that is played at the end of the third quarter, and the ritual of kicking the flagpole for good luck on the way to the Coliseum.
And after 40 years, Bartner still has one of the most famous voices on campus. He can be heard during practice shouting directions, such as “Look at your accents!” in his signature gravelly timbre.
“He’s literally the fire behind this band,” Morris said. “I don’t know how he does it.”
Morris said Bartner’s tireless energy and enthusiasm is what propels the band to improve at every practice.
“He is 69 years old and in better shape than 90 percent of the band, myself included,” Morris said. “He’ll have these paternal moments, like ‘He’s so wise, he’s such a great mentor,’ then he’ll yell at you to take a lap. You never know what to expect.”
Band practice with Bartner is an intense experience with constant repetition of the Tribute to Troy, as well as new music and marching drills for every home game. Errant players
commonly run the occasional lap and drop to the turf to do push-ups.
The band members are so dedicated to the band that sometimes, Bartner said, they even do push-ups for their mistakes without being asked.
“The deepest truth about Art Bartner is that his greatest joy is being a catalyst to draw out of others their gifts and talents,” Calhoun said.
Morris said the band’s two mottos, “Never tired” and “It’s easy to be a good band, and difficult to be a great band,” reflect this intensity.
“We yell harder, we play better, we march better,” Morris said. “Bartner tells us this will be the greatest year we will have.”
Although Bartner and the band take their performances seriously, members say his quirky conducting style makes practice interesting.
“My favorite is when he’ll yell at someone, ‘You in the red shirt!’ on Fridays, but everyone’s wearing red because that’s our red shirt day,” said Erica Dolcini, one of the members of the silks, USC’s color guard, and a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning. “As much as we make fun of him because he can’t hear us on the field, he still commands respect and has an aura of authority.”
Ryan Suter, the leader of the tuba section and a senior majoring in critical studies, said Bartner’s dedication makes him a legend on campus.
“He lives and breathes the USC Trojan Marching Band,” Suter said. “You hear him four days a week, whether or not you’re in the band.”
Although some band members, including Morris, believe that Bartner will retire when Carroll does, Bartner insists his comments are not meant to be taken seriously.
“I jokingly say I will not retire until Pete Carroll retires because I think the world of him. He makes Trojan football fun, exciting and vibrant,” Bartner said.
Despite Rose Bowl shows, TV and movie performances, platinum albums and a career spanning four decades, Bartner is still happiest conducting the Spirit of Troy after a Trojan win.
“The greatest, still most
exhilarating moment to me is after a hard-fought victory,” he said.  “When the team comes over to the band and you get that Conquest, that’s still for me the most exciting moment.”
I can still remember the days I spent holding the ladder that Mr. Bartner stands while directing the Band during the half time.
It still thrills me to hear the band play “The Conquest!”
GO SC, Fight On!
he was unique bloke but he has got a heart of gold to
