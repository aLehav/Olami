As everyone knows, there is an app for practically anything and everything. But sometimes, this concept can be a little overwhelming, especially if you are trying to find the perfect health app. With over one million applications currently available on the Apple app store, it can be difficult to scope out new and exciting additions for your smartphone. Here are iPhone health apps you might not know about, but should download to help you be well throughout the day.
Sleep Cycle. The Sleep Cycle app is an alarm clock that attempts to wake you up at an optimal place in your sleep cycle. A user places the phone somewhere on his or her bed, and the app senses motion to determine when the user is at the closest possible sleep state to being awake. With a fixed alarm clock, you could be unlucky if you wake up in deep sleep. We all know the feeling. Sleep Cycle uses science instead of chance to ease the process of getting up in the morning.
MapMyRun. This app is simple to use for your daily run. You can draw a running route from a certain location and it offers nutrition information, tracks your time, distance and speed, and even lets you post your stats to social media accounts.
Nike Training. If you’re not a big runner, Nike Training provides alternatives to running, providing images and instructions for over 300 exercises with videos for more complicated ones. This app allows you to choose your own workout from upper body to core strength, adding your own exercises and tracking your progress over time.
Daily Workouts. This is a pretty similar concept to Nike Training club, but has some more detailed videos. It’s very basic and lets you choose the body part you want to work out and for how long. The moves are simple, but still a good workout. Try a different one each day!
Charity Miles. Doing good while getting fit is a winning combo for sure. This app allows you to do just that — double incentive to workout. You pick the cause you want to support and hit start! Sponsors then donate 25 cents per mile for walkers/runners and 10 cents per mile for bikers and it really is a great motivator.
Water Logged. We don’t realize how important it is you get your daily dose of water. Most people don’t drink the recommended 8 glasses per day. This app can help you if you have trouble keeping up with your daily intake. It has great visuals and lets you set reminders so make sure you are taking your sips.
Songza. Whether you’re feeling “angsty,” “introspective,” “motivational” or “trippy.” Songza has the picture-perfect song to play with each activity throughout the day and some especially some workout jams. With a wide variety of music options, Songza allows people to choose music based on activity, moods, genres or decades. Download this free app and have tunes to jam to all day long. 
Relax Melodies. After a long day of running around campus from class to class and fitting in your social life, people need to wind down. Relax Melodies allows people to do just that, offering sounds ranging from white noise to a rainy day, to a cat purring.
Headspace, Calm or Power of Mind. If listening to relaxing sounds just isn’t enough for you, try this app which has a series of guided meditations focusing on anxiety release, calmness, positivity, self-acceptance, motivation, peace and many more. I use this any time I need to chill but can’t quiet my mind on my own. It offers guided relaxation and meditations that do the trick at the end of a workout or just after a long day.

Jasmine Li | Daily Trojan
On Wednesday, more than 2,000 people milled outside the famous ZEPP Tokyo Livehouse. Sweaty hands clutched glowsticks; faces were flushed in anticipation. There was only an hour to go until the start of Rib.on.”e” — that is, the concert/release party for Rib’s new album, released hardly a month ago.
Of course, Japanese parents don’t actually go around naming their children after tasty bits of steak. Rib is an online username, a persona featured on the site Niconico Douga — which I like to liken to Japanese Youtube. Similar to their counterparts in the States, young Japanese spend their time sauntering about the Internet, periodically choosing, from within their midst, a few talented souls to launch into stardom.
And what a star Rib has become. ZEPP Tokyo, which is by no means a small, was near to bursting.
I sent a strained smile and a weak joke over to my friend, “This is just as bad as the Yamanote Line rush hour. Except instead of being crushed to death by salarymen, I’m being smothered by JK.” (The Yamanote Line, by the way, is arguably the most important local train line, which circles the heart of Tokyo. JK is a slang term, which in Japanese, doesn’t mean “just kidding,” but rather “joushi-kousei,” or high school girl.)
I had to pause, then, as the girl in front of me was pressed so close that loose strands of her hair were getting into my mouth. I remember that by the end of the live, I was patting down and grooming her hair for her, just so it wouldn’t get in my face.
When the lights finally went out, the crowd swelled up in anticipation, literally. Girls were standing on their toes; hairs were standing on their ends. Finally, the curtain fell down and there was Rib, crooning his soul into a microphone. It was the first time I’ve seen his face, as, unlike most Youtube stars, “NicoDou” singers guard their identities with their lives. He had a smile that stretched to the ends of his high cheekbones. I’d never seen someone look so blissful while singing
Time, of course, flew by — a hodgepodge of songs and MC’s. Rib was talented, charming, and funny. He was awed by the number of people who gathered for him, at times joking (“I feel like I could walk on top of the audience — but that’d be rude, wouldn’t it?”), at times gaping in disbelief (“I keep asking myself — why me?”), and all the time, thanking his fans from the bottom of his heart — and his lacrimal glands. This humbleness, this consciousness of “normality,” I think, is what makes NicoDou singers so popular in Japan. For, over here, the trend is to blur the line between the star and the layperson. I remember one of my Japanese teachers mentioning that the reason the number one idol group, AKB48, is so popular, is because it is made up of “normal, high school girls.”
Watching Rib tear up for the third time, I could feel myself resonating with empathy, sympathy, a sense of connection. Here was a young man who loved music, uploaded a few covers onto the Internet, and now found himself standing on the stage of ZEPP Tokyo, in front of thousands of adoring fans.
“If I told my mother a few years ago I’d be holding my own one-man live at ZEPP,” he said, “she’d ask me if my head were screwed on right.” He paused, and then continued, “I want to keep trying hard. So all of you, too, try your best!”
Leave it to Rib, I thought to myself with a moved sniff, to not only make his live an amazing musical performance, but a source of inspiration as well.

This week, I’m finally taking a break from my usual life stories in lieu of a special occasion that takes place once a semester: midterm season. Despite spending the whole first half of the semester in classes, I have come to realize just days before the tests that I don’t in fact know very much. As someone who puts off studying until I really have to, I share my top procrastinating activities with you in the secret hope that you do them too.
Every single time I come here after long (attempted) study sessions at Leavey library, I immediately regret not utilizing Tapingo. Who has time to wait in a line that goes all the way out the door? Answer: I do, when I’m trying to procrastinate. Yes, indecisive man trying to order a bagel. Please take a little longer. I know the decision between plain and everything can be tough.
Guilty as charged. If you saw a YikYak about an Asian girl at Leavey doing a little clothes shopping while “studying” Latin around nine p.m. yesterday, that was definitely about me. Hey, my four American Apparel shirts should be coming in the mail sometime next week. Hopefully they come on the same day I get my midterm grade back, they’ll make the results sting a little less.
Whether we like to admit it or not, many of us use Yahoo! News as one of our primary, if not the only. news sources. Who cares if it’s less credible than The Washington Post? It’s the sensationalized headlines that are really entertaining and distracting. A two-headed Zebra was born in an Ohio Zoo? It was a hoax? Wow. Either way, you’ve already wasted time clicking on the links and reading the humorous comments from your fellow Americans who are also too lazy to check out a more reliable publication.
Netflix is the ultimate time waster in college, and midterm week only exacerbates our use of instant streaming. Added to this is the really unfortunate timing of House of Cards Season 3’s recent release last week. Or, you might be like me and continue to re-watch episodes of The Office.
Despite the fact that you are probably (read: hopefully) studying more than you do in an average week, you may also be taking more naps. Hey, nothing makes me sleepier than staring at pages of text. I’ve also fallen into the trap of studying in my bed. In my experience, studying while lying down has never ended well…at least for my grades.
