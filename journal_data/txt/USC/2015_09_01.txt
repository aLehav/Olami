Arkaive, an app that provides online attendance management tools created by alumni Jaewoo Kim and Yoomi Chin, is gaining popularity on campus. Since its official release this summer, it has been downloaded by over 3,800 users, including professors and students.
Kim and Chin met at USC 13 years ago during their undergraduate careers. They crossed paths again when Kim approached Chin about launching a geolocation-based attendance application for college classrooms.
Kim was pursuing a master in business administration in London when he came up with the idea for Arkaive. Surprised that professors were still taking roll using pen and paper, Kim wanted to create a more efficient method for recording attendance.
Chin, who is now the chief marketing officer and director of communications at Arkaive, said she was immediately interested in Kim’s idea and wanted to join the venture.
“As an education researcher, I really believe in the need for technological innovations in schools, especially when it involves empowerment through participatory education,” Chin said.
Arkaive is currently working on an education-philanthropy initiative called “#OneStreetOver,” which aims to improve opportunities for homeless children in local neighborhoods.
Chin explained that professors get to help pay for homeless children in the greater Los Angeles area based on the attendance in their classrooms.
“Once an instructor pays a monthly subscription fee for the Arkaive app, we look at the average class attendance rate for that professor,” Chin said. “For example, if a professor has an average attendance rate of 85 percent attendance for a given month … then donate 85 percent of our net revenue to help the education of homeless children in that community.”
At USC, several professors have already adopted Arkaive in their classrooms.
Price School of Public Policy adjunct professor Mark Ruff recently started using it in his graduate-level real estate development class and his undergraduate policy, planning and development class.
“Before [using Arkaive], I had been taking attendance the traditional way with a sign-up sheet and then transferring it later to my own spreadsheet,” he said. “I kept thinking there had to be a better way to do this.”
After receiving an email from Arkaive about an automated attendance application, Ruff decided to give the app a chance. He signed up right before the first day of class and informed all of his enrolled students that he would be using it.
According to Ruff, Arkaive has already improved efficiency in his classroom after only one week.
“I love it, my students love it, one of my undergrads even told me last week that she wished all her professors used it,” he said.
A junior majoring in international relations, Jasper Hsu, said that his experience with Arkaive has been a positive.
“I used Arkaive for my ECON 205 class last semester,” Jasper said. “Throughout the semester, the app compiled our attendance data and allowed us to see our overall attendance rate.”
Jasper noted Arkaive’s excusal request function, which allows students to notify professors if they are going to miss a class.
“We can simply send in a request for the date we’ll be absent, and the professor will be able to see it,” Jasper said. “This convenient function takes away the chaotic problem of having our excusal requests lost in large email systems.”
Chin said that some of the immediate goals for the company include motivating students to attend class more often, encouraging professors to create dialogue within the classroom and raising public awareness about homeless children and their need for higher education.
“Eventually, we want to create an online platform where students and instructors of higher education can archive and track their information and resources,” Chin said. “We also want to identify ourselves as a socially responsible company that gives back to the community.”

The Interfraternity Council has placed sanctions on the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity after a person associated with the organization was transported to a local hospital on Aug. 29.
The transport, which occurred at 12:47 a.m. on Saturday morning according to the Department of Public Safety incident log, directly violated the Greek recruitment moratorium period, which effectively bans alcohol consumption until the end of the recruitment periods.
“Sigma Alpha Mu will not be permitted to participate in Spring recruitment, and they will not be permitted to hold any internal or external social events for six weeks with the exception of service-oriented, philanthropic projects,” said Jake Simon, president of the IFC. “Furthermore, they will need to work with their national organization to restructure their new member program to reflect the values of our council and their national organization.”
The IFC Judicial Board decided upon the terms of the sanctions.
Simon said the sanctions will act as a reminder toward the code greek organizations should follow.
“The sanctions are intended to be educational and reinforce the policies that strengthen our community and member chapters,” Simon said. “We expect that Sigma Alpha Mu will respond by improving their practices, ultimately strengthening their chapter and serving as a positive representation of our council.”
Representatives from Sigma Alpha Mu could not be reached for comment.

Leavey Library recently completed renovations of its second-floor information commons. The revamped facilities have been open to students since the start of the semester last Monday.
The renovations, funded by the Office of the Provost, took place over the course of the summer.
Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, said that it was imperative that renovations be completed before the beginning of the fall semester.
Some major highlights of the renovation are the new carpeting, paint and furniture that mirror the new decor of the first floor and basement. The first floor and basement were the first portion of Leavey to receive renovations back in 2014.
Students have already been responding favorably to the renovations that have taken place.
Rachel Hutson, a junior majoring in theatre, said that she is glad to see the availability of Mac computers, printers, space and bright lighting that accompany the newly painted walls.
“It seems like the lighting is a lot nicer … It is bright in here,” Hutson said. “I like the way it is organized. It is not stuffy but really open.”
Students can now look forward to more study seats on the second floor as seat numbers increased from 206 to 310 seats. The additional seats at Leavey arose from the shrinking of computer desk sizes from the past.
“With today’s technology, we don’t need furniture that big,” Quinlan said.
Quinlan mentioned that when Leavey opened in the 1990s, its computers were much larger and needed more room to accommodate. Today’s desktop computer, however, takes up less space, and Leavey is thus able to accommodate more desks and seats.
Increasing capacity and facilities was a major focus of the renovations. USC Libraries has purchased more printers, scanners and copiers for the various floors in order to handle the increase in students.
Study rooms have also increased capacity. Two specific group study rooms on the second floor are able to accommodate up to 14 students each.
In terms of technology, Leavey has installed 76 upgraded Windows and Mac desktop computers that run productivity, statistical and design software. There is also now increased access to electrical outlets for laptop users.
Quinlan expressed her satisfaction with student efficiency as it relates to the new layout of the second floor.
“There’s more space, more chairs, more capacity and especially more variety of space so that it’s not just a study desk or cubicle and there’s more ways to rearrange the furniture to support what the students are trying to do,” Quinlan said.
The renovations are in response to USG advocating renovation of the Leavey interiors. USC Libraries conducted surveys asking students if they believe Leavey Library should be renovated and how it could better suit students’ academic needs.
Hugh McHarg, associate dean for programs and planning at USC Libraries, said that it was clear from students’ surveys that the library needed more study spaces.
“The Academic Affairs Committee of USG got very interested in working with us to update Leavey Library so that it could better support the scholarly activities of our students,” Quinlan said. “They were very interested in making progress in how the space was arranged so that it could more fully encourage students to study in groups.”
The second floor renovations are the second major facelift project undertaken at Leavey Library. The first renovation project took place last summer and involved upgrading the basement, first levels and the front terrace.
USC Libraries plans on continuing renovations of Leavey Library next summer with the third floor.

The Undergraduate Student Goverment Senate convened for its first session of this semester Tuesday night. The session’s focal point was a presentation by USG President Rini Sampath, in which she discussed, among other topics, the issue of the cost of college.
“College affordability is an issue for all students, but especially for low-income students and students who come from middle-class families,” Sampath said.
Sampath said students have reached out to her regarding difficulty with tuition increases and the financial aid office.
“Many students are coming to USC expecting their college tuition [to be]covered by these different aid programs,” she said. “But from the emails that I’ve been getting from students, they are having issues with the financial aid office, and they are having issues with the costs going up. Tuition went up $2,000 this year, and we don’t know where that money is going.”
After the session adjourned, Sampath said that it “breaks  [her] heart” to know of students transferring out of USC, taking leaves of absence or stopping their education altogether because of rising tuition costs or insufficient aid packages.
Alec White, USG residential senator, stated that he personally knows of two friends who had to leave USC because of tuition difficulties. He added that other universities are tackling these issues.
“Other schools have policies that work well,” White said. “For example, Stanford had one policy that said that if your parents make $125,000 a year or less, you get free tuition. Some schools, like Penn State, have had tuition freezes.”
Sampath also commented on other universities’ tuition policies. She mentioned George Washington University, a private college that charges students the same tuition all four years.
“For example, let’s say that [coming] into USC with a tuition of $42,000 a year, it will cost [this amount] the rest of the four years; it will not increase,” Sampath said. “Whereas, as Alec was saying, since we came into college, tuition has increased by a couple thousand dollars. That’s just not OK. If you adjust on inflation, it doesn’t even reflect those numbers, so I don’t think the excuse of inflation really works as a college affordability stance.”
Sampath and White delineated their advocacy strategy, which will begin with a student survey.
“We are going to be doing advocacy work on all fronts, in terms of talking to the communities most affected by these types of problems,” Sampath said. “We are going to be reaching out to different cultural assemblies to see how their constituents are affected by college affordability. We will urge students to share their college affordability stories with me personally, to email me and to meet with me.”
Another important issue discussed during the meeting was the mental health of the student body. USG will work with the Academic Culture Assembly and Wellness Affairs to “tackle mental health on campus.” USG is also looking to implement a fall break — contingent on a vote from the faculty senate — and expand cultural resource centers.

The counseling center at the Engemann Student Health Center added six new full-time staff members this semester. This initiative, which began after meetings between President C.L. Max Nikias, Provost  Michael Quick and Undergraduate Student Government  last semester, will decrease waiting times for students seeking counseling.
Hannah Nguyen, director of USG’s Academic Culture Assembly and an organizer of Health Awareness Month, said that this is the first step in the right direction.
“It’s a wonderful milestone for mental health on campus,” Nguyen said. “The way the counseling center works is getting a little out of hand.”
USG President Rini Sampath, who has placed this issue at the forefront of USG’s agenda, mentioned that some students had to be transferred to counseling centers in other areas.
“If a student were to call the student counseling center and ask for an appointment, they would have to wait several weeks for that appointment to actually take place,” Sampath said. “These students were being essentially outsourced to these services Downtown and in other areas, and some of them actually said that it increased their feeling of anxiety and stress to actually have to go somewhere else.”
Christine Hasrouni, USG director of wellness affairs, discussed how before this recent addition, the total number of full-time staff members — after combining counselors’ part-time hours and full-time hours — totaled 17, a small number for the nearly 43,000 students attending USC. Hasrouni added that this negative assessment of USC’s mental health services is quite impartial.
“Members of different universities across the nation, including UCLA, came to our campus and reviewed our counseling center and, overwhelmingly, all of them said, ‘There are not enough counselors,’” Hasrouni said. “They did interviews with the staff and students, and I was one of the people they interviewed, so after that they took it to higher administration and agreed … We need more counselors.”
Hasrouni hopes that this new addition will lead to a gradual increase in full-time staff in upcoming years. However, she also stated that increasing staff at Engemann wouldn’t necessarily benefit all groups of students.
“One of the problems is that counseling and therapy are very western ideas in general, and not everyone feels comfortable seeing a therapist, and so we have to look at different routes of how we deal with mental health,” Hasrouni said.
One solution Hasrouni mentioned is to allocate counselors at the University’s various cultural centers, in order to offer students staff members that understand specific cultural issues. Sampath also stressed the importance of dealing with cultural taboos.
“What about access for marginalized communities that have a stigma around mental illness?” Sampath said. “For example, Asian Pacific Islander communities, unfortunately, do not seek out mental health because there is a stigma around mental health, so one thing we are hoping to do is encourage the administration to implement counselors at the resource centers.”
Furthermore, Sampath is hoping that in the future, counselors will be available in residence halls to shorten distances and facilitate access for students.
“I am interested to see in moving beyond conversations of counselors at the counseling center into conversations about what does it mean to take care of our students,” Sampath said.
Sampath said she wants USC to stop worrying about regulations and more about students’ health.
“There is one phrase that I really liked that we discussed at the Pac-12 summit this weekend: ‘moving beyond compliance and creating a culture of care,’” Sampath said. “Our university and administrators need to know that it is not just about complying with the rules and regulations of the federal government and American Disabilities Act or whatever it might be, but really asking, ‘Are our students happy and comfortable, or are they excluded from the conversation?’”
Viewing the issue with a practical outlook, Hasrouni said that a major strategy would be to better publicize the resources that already exist.
“There are so many things on campus dealing with mental health that students don’t know about,” Hasrouni said. “For example, we have the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion. They have wellness advocates, which are students that go through training on different issues like mental health, sexual health and nutrition, and they hold office hours and are meant for peer help … And in that office they also have massage chairs and free coffee.”
—-a stigma around mental illness?
Only if you are willing to play that mind game.
I am not.

If you thought that USC football had a bad past week of PR, then you probably haven’t been paying enough attention to Baylor’s recent debacle. Yes, coach Steve Sarkisian dominated the headlines because of off-the-field issues — three of five Daily Trojan columnists, including myself, contributed to that media hoopla — but the controversy involving Baylor as well as Boise State was certainly more significant.
The controversy is over how much Boise State disclosed  about and how much Baylor paid attention to the disciplinary record of a player who transferred from Boise to Baylor. In May 2013, Sam Ukwuachu was kicked off the Boise State football team because of an uncooperative attitude and violent personality. In October, after transferring to Baylor, he raped his then-girlfriend. This past month, he was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to six months in jail plus 10 years of probation.
During Ukwuachu’s rape trial, his ex-girlfriend at Boise State — different from his ex-girlfriend at Baylor — testified that she had been domestically abused by Ukwuachu, though no charges for it were filed. Chris Petersen, then the head coach at Boise State but currently the Washington head coach, has said that he was very upfront with Baylor head coach Art Briles about Ukwuachu’s disciplinary issues before transferring, but Briles has said Peterson did not disclose any information about Ukwuachu’s violence against women. Baylor has since launched an investigation into how the school handled the transfer process and has caught a lot of flak for it.
The issues of domestic and sexual assault are all too common in football. In fact, before Sarkisian was stealing the headlines for his public intoxication, it was the alleged sexual assault by former Trojan tight end Bryce Dixon that was the big news around USC football. The Dixon situation may have faded out of the headlines by now, but it deserves more attention. The Boise/Baylor he-said-she-said shows not only how prevalent this problem is in college football, but also how important it is to treat these issues with  vigorous attention to detail.
Digging into the personal lives of classmates is very weird. I don’t even like calling out players’ on-field performances because I still buy into the veil of amateurism for these student-athletes. But these players are also legal adults who could be tried as such for serious crimes like sexual assault, and the severity of these allegations is worth discussing.
Last fall, Dixon allegedly violated affirmative consent laws during an encounter with a fellow student. He was suspended for part of the past season for a violation of team rules, and it’s unclear whether or not that was related to the alleged assault, but he was allowed back on the team later in the season. This spring, at the conclusion of a school investigation, Dixon was expelled from the university. His expulsion has since been overturned after an appeal, but he has not been allowed back on the football team.
The Dixon case, like a lot of other college sexual assault cases but unlike Ukwuachu’s case, is interesting because Dixon was not tried as a legal adult for the crime. The case was handled by the university as a student conduct issue, not as a felony. It wasn’t until Dixon’s appeal of USC’s ruling that it went to a court of law this summer.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O’Brien ordered USC to stay the expulsion of Dixon after concluding that Dixon was not granted due process during USC’s investigation. Dixon has been reinstated to the university, but the judge’s ruling didn’t change his standing with the football team. His legal team said it would not seek a court order to reinstate him to the team.
This is a very concerning condemnation of the USC Title IX Office’s procedure on sexual assault. Dixon’s lawyers claimed that USC’s investigation “is utterly lacking in due process, with no hearing, no right to counsel, no rules of evidence, no presumption of innocence, no right to possess copies of witness statements and evidence and no right to confront witnesses against him.” And the judge ruled in Dixon’s favor.
Likewise, details from the investigation leave some pretty serious question marks about what actually happened. Dixon was actually investigated twice for alleged violations of affirmative consent policy and, according to reports, both incidents involved the same alleged survivor, but he was only ruled to have violated affirmative consent in the second case. How can there be two instances between the same parties of unclear consent, yet an investigation rules only the second actually violated affirmative consent? Why weren’t both violations? To me, it just doesn’t add up.
The other big question I have is how USC can defer to the Superior Court’s judgment on Dixon’s standing as a university student but then maintain autonomy in determining his status as a student-athlete. Yes, playing for a varsity sports team at USC carries certain responsibilities unique to other students. But this still seems inconsistent.
These are obviously very complicated subjects, and it’s hard to find some concrete takeaway when so much is in doubt. The Baylor/Boise State scandal shows that even when it looks like a school is taking a serious, no-tolerance approach to these problems, it can make the problem even worse by just spreading it elsewhere. I could segue this into a much larger discussion on the problems of the American criminal justice system, but this has already strayed far enough away from a “sports” column.
I won’t go as far as saying Dixon should be let back on the team, but based off of what we know, the school has, at best, been very inconsistent in dealing with the case. The opposite problem of being too lenient toward athletes like Baylor or even Florida State in the past is arguably an even bigger problem. But erring on the other end of the spectrum and violating due process is nonetheless significant. USC issued a statement after the ruling saying it stands by its judicial process and its findings from the case, but the school seems too afraid to admit it was wrong and let Dixon back onto the team.
When Sarkisian’s punishment for his incident was a public scolding and a physical workout ordered by his team — the kind of pointless hazing that gets fraternities in trouble with University administration — yet receives no actual discipline from the administration, USC looks pretty hypocritical.
This again begs the question of how Sarkisian will be able to effectively handle discipline issues with his team down the road. One hundred up-downs seems like it would be the appropriate punishment for tardiness, but that’s about it. Any time something more significant happens, this double standard will always be a talking point.
Yes, the allegations against Dixon are much more severe than Sarkisian’s misstep, but there’s no uncertainty regarding Sarkisian’s incident. The school does not appear to hold its employees to the same standard as its students in these two cases.
Luke Holthouse is a junior majoring in policy, planning and development and broadcast and digital journalism. His column, “Holthouse Party,” runs Wednesdays.
Good article, except the actual facts of the Dixon case are confidential, and only the parties involved, Title IX, Student Body of Appeals and USC know the real evidence, witness statements and truth.  I have heard, and read, from many that there are so many false stories and vicious rumors being spread on the internet, trying to attack and hurt the victim.  I have also heard from other football players that he was a great player on the field, but had terrible character representing cardinal & gold off the field.  It’s unfortunate that Bryce tries to sue the University to play football, in addition to trying to character attack his victim again with slanderous defamation on the internet.  Hopefully he’ll get some good advice and try to focus on his education instead.

With a year at USC and a summer in China under her belt, sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie is more than ready to face the fast approaching season with a newfound confidence and an elevated level of play.
As a freshman, Abercrombie appeared in 15 matches and recorded a total of 56 kills. So far this season, Abercrombie has appeared in all three matches and recorded 30 kills, the second highest on the team.
Her play this past weekend against then-No. 7 University of North Carolina, Chicago State and then-No. 11 Brigham Young University, was something that USC fans missed out on last season. Abercrombie came out of high school as one of the top 10 volleyball players in the class of 2014.
With the look of her play so far, Abercrombie is on track to become USC’s next volleyball star, completing the strong offensive attack alongside seniors opposite hitter Samantha Bricio and middle blocker Alicia Ogoms.
Abercrombie and Ogoms already have a great defensive chemistry together, racking up multiple solid blocks this past weekend.
Following her freshman year, Abercrombie was selected to play on the USA Volleyball U.S Collegiate National Team, which toured China during the month of June. She was led by Arizona State University head coach, Jason Watson, and joined by 11 other sophomores, juniors and seniors from colleges across the U.S.
While in China, Abercrombie played against professional teams comprised of 23-year-olds who played volleyball a little differently than here in the States. Along the way, she said she made new friendships and bonded over a love of volleyball with her new teammates.
“I learned so much about volleyball,” Abercrombie said. “You had to adapt quickly, and it was just fun to battle with new people.”
Looking back on her past experiences, Abercrombie feels more confident heading into her sophomore season. She’s familiar with the system here at USC and is ready to face anything that comes her way.
“You know what’s going on, and you’re not really surprised by anything,” Abercrombie said.
For the Women of Troy, Abercrombie is not the only one who is feeling more confident. The team as a whole has adopted a more confident mentality, and Abercrombie has noticed that the team’s “chemistry is all there.”
“Everyone has each other’s backs,” Abercrombie said.  “We’re there to compete because we all just love the sport.”
Abercrombie said she is motivated by her internal drive, which she said is a mandatory quality when playing.
“You just learn to grind and to have it in you, to get better and compete all the time,” Abercrombie said. “That’s what drives me.”
Abercrombie said volleyball is a rewarding sport. Despite the highs and lows that arise from the game, she said the adrenaline rush makes all of the hard work worth it.
Abercrombie especially enjoys the team aspect of the game. Volleyball allows her to spend time with her best friends.
“You get to do the sport you love with the people you love,” Abercrombie shared.
A Southern California native, Abercrombie was drawn to USC from the moment she first stepped on campus. On the same trip, she also visited UCLA, but said she fell in love with USC, its traditions and volleyball’s prominence at the University.
She saw USC as more than just a school where she would play volleyball. She loved the atmosphere USC had to offer.
Looking forward to the season, Abercrombie is optimistic.
“Our culture in the practice gym is really good,” Abercrombie said. “We all are competing all the time and that translates over to the games really well.”
Trojan fans can come watch Abercrombie and the rest of the Women of Troy take on Utah State to start off the USC Classic on Sept. 10 at 10 a.m. at the Galen Center.

In the wake of national criticism of head coach Steve Sarkisian’s inappropriate behavior at Salute to Troy, the Trojans are more focused than ever at practices. The team has put the incident behind them and is moving forward in preparation for Saturday’s game against Arkansas State.
“I think this brought us closer together,” said quarterback Cody Kessler about Sarkisian’s action last week.
The synchronization between the pace of the players, drills and music accentuate a team united. According to Sarkisian, practices like Tuesday’s are a competition. In 11 on 11 drills, the first team offense went head-to-head with the first team defense and the second teams were sprinkled in and out of drills to best utilize the deepest roster coach Sarkisian has had while at USC. While competing, all players are fighting to demonstrate to the coaching staff that they should be on the field to start Saturday’s game against Arkansas State.
“You got to see the ones against the ones and the twos against the twos compete,” said Dan Weber, former coach and scout.com contributor, while observing Tuesday’s practice. “But the interesting thing with this team this year is that there is not much of a dropoff between the two. So when they are switching out it looks like a couple of sessions of ones versus ones.”
In injury news, four players who Sark described as “very limited” Tuesday were Lamar Dawson (ribs), Justin Davis (ribs), Claude Pelon (knee) and Jordan Simmons (knee). Sarkisian said having them available would be a “bonus.” Nose tackle Antwaun Woods practiced with the first team with a large brace on his right arm. Freshman safety Ykili Ross (shoulder) was on the field and active but in a            non-contact yellow jersey. Tight end Taylor McNamara left practice early because of what Sarkisian described as lightheadedness.
Coach Sarkisian did his part to create a more united and prepared football team Saturday when he announced that offensive coordinator Clay Helton would call the plays this upcoming season. In an attempt to allow Sarkisian more time and flexibility to better manage the defense and special teams, he is recruiting an Aussie Rugby-style punter, Chris Tilbey, who could be with the team the next four years. Guiding every facet of the team gives Sarkisian a chance to instill a more complete vision of how the Trojans will look this year.
“I love calling plays — that’s what I do … how I got into this profession and worked my way through it,” Sarkisian said. “But I want to be a great head coach. I don’t want to set offensive records and finish 8-5 or 9-4. I want to win 13 games and 14 games.”
Coach Helton called plays for USC when he was interim coach for the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl against Fresno State, a game the Trojans won, 45-20. It is his special relationship with Cody Kessler that has Trojan fans excited about what the two can do next year.
“I have been with Kessler for seven years now,” Helton said.  “It is like having a coach on the field. It is really like he is reading my mind. Any time you have a fifth-year senior it is incredibly beneficial as a play-caller and an offensive coordinator.”
Adding to the offense, coach Steve Sarkisian said all three freshmen tailbacks — Dominic Davis, Ronald Jones II and Aca’Cedric Ware — will play in Saturday’s opener against Arkansas State. Chad Wheeler has battled his way back from injury and will be getting the nod at starting offensive tackle Saturday.
“I compete with these guys who work so hard day in and day out. And to be named the starter is an honor. I just can’t wait to get out there, ” Wheeler said.
While Tuesday’s practice was surrounded by an aura of newness with the first game coming up and Helton being named the offensive play caller, the theme of practice hasn’t changed: finish. Since training camp opened for the USC Trojans, head coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff have implemented a “Finish Challenge” to avoid            end-of-game collapses. At the end of drills, players often turn up the energy. They run faster, hit harder and encourage the younger guys to do the same. It’s contagious. And it’s clear that players haven’t forgotten about the two last-minute losses from last season.
“You get excited. I want to see our guys play,”  Sarkisian said. “I want to see what they look like after all the work. I want to see our offense, our defense and our special teams. I want to see some of our new players. I want to see the development of our veteran players from one season to the next. So yeah, I am as excited as anyone to hit.”

Montana Reed might be in his second year at USC, but his major is still fairly new — both to him and the University. That’s because Reed is majoring in art, technology and the business of innovation with an emphasis on design and venture management, as part of the first class in the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for the Arts.
Reed’s emphasis on design and venture management is a result of his interest in running a small business to do design for products. This past summer, the sophomore had the opportunity to intern with Create Advertising in Culver City, entertainment marketing agency that specializes in fulfilling the creative needs of film, television, gaming and branding clients. Reed interned in the company’s virtual reality research and development department along with two other Academy students, Matt Stern and Evan Bovie.
Representatives of Create Advertising were brought in as guest speakers at The Academy to discuss the concept of virtual reality. They also talked about the production process, which resonated with Reed and allowed him to hypothesize projects and connect with them about the internship. He explained that he went into the internship not knowing exactly what to expect or how much he would end up learning.
“There are no virtual reality professionals that exist necessarily, so going into that field, we didn’t really have much to work off of,” Reed said. “It was more just moving forward and discovering new things for [the company].”
He began his internship testing experiences the company had already created, as well as networking with interested parties. But eventually, he moved into the creative side for the production of a new project where he and his colleagues were able to have their own input.
Reed believes that The Academy prepared him well for the internship. He said the intimate focus of having a small academic environment generated an atmosphere in which students could learn not only from professors, but also from each other. Reed described how he and his colleagues were able to utilize a range of skills for the company in the areas of design, business, technology, coding, film and mechanical engineering.
“The people we were working for were actually pretty blown away,” Reed said. “It really impressed them how three people who were freshmen were able to accomplish so many tasks as efficiently as we did. But we had been working together all year [at The Academy] so we already developed a very efficient work flow together and knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses.”
During the latter half of the internship, Reed, Stern and Bowie were able to work on a 360-degree video shoot that was their own project. They had to familiarize themselves with areas of business to find cameras, rent out a location and build a crew.
“It was great because we got to really experience the full spectrum of what it takes to actually produce something,” Reed said.
In addition to the resourcefulness of operating in a small setting, Reed believes the combination of knowledge about recent technologies with ways to communicate in professional settings made him more confident about working in a creative field.
“We were able to talk to any of these creative individuals, and we knew about what softwares they were using and we could communicate with them . . . we’ve had so many guest speakers that it didn’t feel unnatural at all to present work we had created that we felt proud of,” he said.
Reed advised those looking for their first internship in college to experiment with something they’re passionate about, not to take an internship just to have one. After that, it’s about making the most of the opportunity.
“Having connections or knowing people at the place you’re interning is pretty important so you can actually get involved and sink your teeth into some work,” Reed said.

In an unsuspecting location on 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles, a small restaurant stands inconspicuously except for the long line of patrons hankering for an authentic Filipino fix. Since July 6, Rice Bar has been serving up rice bowls filled with fair trade grains imported from the Philippines, a sustainable approach welcomed by Angelenos. The home-style cooking featured at Rice Bar might be simple, but it certainly brings customers a comfortable feeling.
The atmosphere of Rice Bar is cozy and humble, which is due in part to its 275-square-foot limited space. Despite being one of the smallest eateries in town, the counter seating is hardly a drawback. Customers have the fortune of watching Charles Olalia, the former executive chef at the Michelin-ranked Patina, craft traditional rice bowls packed with unique flavors. Olalia partnered with Rice Bar’s owner, Santos Uy, to create a menu with a distinct personality while maintaining an authentic Filipino flavor. Together, they are making major headway in the Filipino fusion trend that has recently overtaken the Los Angeles food scene.
The ordering process is straightforward: Choose your rice and your ulam (flavor) and finish with sarsa (condiments). Displayed on the menu are suggested rice pairings for each ulam as well as daily specials, which customers are required to order as listed. First-timers are encouraged to try the pork longgansia, a housemade sweet and spicy sausage served with garlic fried rice and pickled vegetables. When topped with a fried egg, the longgansia becomes an essential and unregrettable choice. The dish balances the flavors of the traditionally sweet longgansia and is not overwhelmingly fatty nor salty. Another menu staple is the bistek tagalog, marinated beef accompanied by a sweet Thai rice and sauteed grilled red onions. Those unfamiliar with the Filipino staple may be turned off by the intense saltiness of the meat; however, for those who can handle it, the flavor is balanced by the suggested sweeter sides.
To top off the meal, Rice Bar offers coconut ice pops called iced buko, a common corner store refreshment in the Philippines. They are a refreshing way to beat the late summer Los Angeles heat. The kitchen also serves homemade crispy rice treats as a fun play on the idea of a “rice bar.” The dessert is nothing special, but customers are tempted to indulge in interesting flavor combinations such as chocolate, coconut oil, espresso, vanilla, lime and marshmallow.
Rice Bar’s prices are comparable to those of any other customizable dining location in Los Angeles. Though they have been deemed a bit high in comparison to the amount of food given, the prices are justified for the quality and richness of the meal itself. And, because the menu is flexible, restaurant goers can pick and choose if they really need to save.
Though Filipino food might not be the average college student’s instinctual craving, Rice Bar is a must for USC students. The location on 7th Street can be conveniently accessed via the Metro Expo Line, saving students from the ever-present parking struggle in Downtown. Chef Olalia has truly taken Filipino food to new levels with homestyle meals rich in flavor and soul and created a joint that even notoriously picky Filipino foodies have come to praise.

In 2012, singer Carly Rae Jepsen rose to fame with her explosive hit “Call Me Maybe.” Three years later, Jepsen tries to match her previous success with her third album, Emotion.
The production of Emotion was no easy feat. “We had the biggest single in the world last time and didn’t have the biggest album,” Jepsen’s manager, Scooter Braun, told The New York Times in July. That being said, Emotion was a pleasant surprise — not only because of the overall maturity of the lyrics, but also due to the undeniably addictive ’80s vibe that laces the whole album together.
That’s not to say that there aren’t low points. Some of the songs still croon superficial love, a difficult topic for college students to relate to. In “Boy Problems,” the song starts with “If you’re gonna go then go / She said to me on the phone,” which is reminiscent of Owl City and Jepsen’s sappy “Good Time.” Luckily, songs like “Favourite Colour,” “Warm Blood” and “When I Needed You” tackle the complications of relationships in a more complex manner. “When I Need You” features lyrics such as, “I don’t know what you wanted / I tried to be so perfect / I thought that it was worth it / To let myself disappear.”
The album faintly echoes Kiss, where “Call Me Maybe” found fame. Jepsen’s first single from this album, “I Really Like You,” follows the footsteps of “Call Me Maybe” with its catchy lyrics and similar promotional tactics, both of which included viral lip-syncing videos by fellow Canadian pop star Justin Bieber. Her second single, “Run Away with Me,” however, is a much better representation of the album. Arguably, “Run Away with Me” has the best chance to be the biggest hit on this album. There are clear traces of 80s pop music, making it very trendy, like Taylor Swift’s 1989.
Most importantly, it is apparent why the album was three years in the making.
“I wanted to be able to take my time making an album that felt like every song was there for a reason and had a vital place,” Jepsen told USA Today, when comparing her latest attempt with previous hit songs.
Though Jepsen is in no hurry to step away from her category of pop songs, the album still has so much to offer. Jepsen’s forte in catchy lyrics mixed with the instrumentalization of this album in the most harmonic manner. Her voice has a smooth quality that adds to the enjoyment of the songs.
Though the bridge of “Gimmie Love” or the entire “I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance” are brilliant moments on the album, none of the songs can be deemed as unforgettable. Jepsen’s overall production would have been particularly resonating had she conveyed her personal experiences on this record. But admirably, Jepsen separates herself from most superstars in the industry. Swift’s personal love ballads and displays of her personality at her concerts and in the media create a connection among everyone in her fan base. Beyoncé sings about female empowerment and pushes her listeners to think about social issues. Jepsen, however, shows little of her personal emotions on this album, leaving a sense of mystery in her listeners. At the root of it, the album is a construction of some great collaborations and some quality songs.
Overall, this album is catered toward pop-music lovers. Those looking for a more personal experience with this album will be displeased. The effort is definitely commendable, and more than anything, it shows Jepsen’s potential to the public. Emotion shows that Carly Rae Jepsen is anything but a one-hit wonder.

“Overworked and un(der) paid” has tragically been dubbed the unofficial college intern’s mantra. As interns are desperate to gain work experience in an increasingly competitive workplace, their treatment in the hiring process is more often ignored. And the shocking lack of response when it comes to applications — many interns do not even receive rejection letters — is unfair to applicants who take the time and effort to apply.
Interns are nobodies, bottom of the circuit, unimportant and easily replaceable. Thousands of interns may apply to NBCUniversal’s Campus 2 Career Internship and never hear anything back. That’s typical. There is no way that NBCUniversal can get back to everyone because of the volume of applications it receives.
Yet it’s when someone comes in for an interview that it is simply rude and inappropriate not to provide any response or feedback, even if in the form of a rejection. A student dresses in his or her best interview attire, practices interview responses and takes the time to come in to the office or talk on the phone. Yet, more often than not, he or she is still not notified about the outcome of the interview.
Polls on various career-oriented sites prove that it’s a common trend that interviewees do not hear back. According to a 2013 CareerBuilder study, 60 percent of employees have not heard back after a job interview. And in response to a Workopolis poll that asked “How long did it take the employer to respond after your last interview?” 24 percent of respondents said 24 hours, 17 percent said one to two weeks, 15 percent said over two weeks and 43 percent said they never heard back at all.
After interviewing at production companies, I had been optimistic about the process. I followed up with my polite “thank you” email and still never heard back. I once read an entire 110-page feature-length script for a company, wrote a synopsis and analyzed the script, providing my comments about the plot, characters and story. After spending at least a few hours completing this assignment, I never heard back from the company.
The company’s invitation for an interview indicated that I had some qualifications relevant to the hiring process. But the lack of response not only left me feeling like I had wasted my time, but also fostered ill feelings toward the company. I would rather receive a simple, “Thanks for your time. We went with someone with more experience,” than to be left staring at my inbox. I took time to drive there, find parking — thanks, L.A. — dress up, research the company and the least the hiring manager could do is send me a quick email acknowledging my time. It’s the polite and professional thing to do.
Companies understand that performing such tasks takes time, effort and a certain degree of interest from the candidate, and yet they still don’t take the time to send a simple “yes,” “no” or even “thank you.”
Not only does not responding to interviewees hurt the applicant’s feelings, but it’s also harmful to the company. In fact, the 2013 CareerBuilder survey found that a candidate’s negative experience in the hiring process can lead to a broader impact on a company’s ability to recruit top talent. Forty-two percent of workers said they would never seek employment with a company again if they were displeased with the way their application was handled. Another 22 percent said they would tell others not to work there. Transparency also benefits the company because applicants can keep considering the potential offer while responding to other opportunities.
An article posted on LinkedIn speculates that companies may not respond to their interviewees for the following reasons: officials are still deciding, they fear legal consequences, the job might not be available after all, the hiring manager is not the person deciding or the person in charge is simply rude. However, these issues could be fixed with just a bit of transparency on the side of the person hiring.
To hiring managers: If it’s a week after the interview and you’re still deciding, simply send an email saying that you really enjoyed interviewing that candidate, but you still have other interviews to proceed with before making a final decision. If the job isn’t available anymore, email the candidate telling them you enjoyed the meeting but unfortunately the job isn’t available. There’s nothing wrong with keeping the candidate in the loop.
Do your company a favor and just reject people, already. A nice rejection can make a candidate feel like the company was worth applying to. More so, people are more likely to reapply if they’ve had a good experience with the hiring staff. And if anyone deserves to be treated well in the hiring process, it’s the intern — who wants so badly to get experience that they’re working un(der) paid.

At USC, no student is safe from the frequent microaggressions tossed around, usually without a second thought.
“When I look at you, I don’t see color.”
“What are you? You’re so exotic.”
“I jewed him.”
These verbal or nonverbal snubs, regardless of their intention, send negative messages toward marginalized groups. The seemingly small digs can create hostile environments.
For many, college is a time to learn how to be sensitive to these slights. Both administrators and students are discussing ways to minimize them.
At the University of California, some have even gone as far as suggesting an outright ban on the use of such microaggressions in the classroom. Earlier this year, the UC system published a list of microaggressions and invited its deans and department heads to take part in a seminar aimed at promoting inclusivity and discouraging the use of common microaggressions such as: “There is only one race, the human race” and “You speak English very well.”
In the UC’s list of microaggressions, 10 themes are addressed and a host of phrases were banned. But the administration can revisit the list later and revise it — further banning what can and can’t be said on campus. Because when it comes to listing all microaggressions, it never stops.
The definition of “microaggressions” changes every day because of the ever-evolving idea of political correctness.
Many media organizations have written about the decision to ban or not ban discourse that uses microaggressions. Yet, the conversation should not be framed this way. Instead, the focus should be on the issues that cause students to feel the microaggressions — real and systemic inequality in the United States.
Universities can’t fully discuss these issues without using microaggressions. Some college professors have received backlash for assigning books that use racial epithets or have references to homosexual activities. And some colleges have had to justify why they are assigning American classics like Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a book that uses derogatory language toward black people. Offensive language is found in classic literature throughout history — because it wasn’t always offensive, but now it is. It’s important to discuss why that change happened, and we can’t do that without engaging directly with the language.
Banning offensive language doesn’t get rid of the problem — it buries it under political correctness. Rather than regulate what can or can’t be said within an academic environment, universities should instead encourage honest conversations about why some communities are marginalized and what we can do to correct it.
Instead of policing academic discourse, we should redirect the conversation toward creating an environment where people can challenge and question why someone would simplify issues by using microaggressions. In the classroom, discussion could focus on how these microaggressions have been formed over the years and why it might be time to rethink what we’re saying.
College campuses are the incubators that engage people with other backgrounds and from all walks of life to learn what’s appropriate before we’re expected to know it all in the workplace. No other environment could be more ideal. Therefore microaggressions should not be regulated, but must be discussed with the goal of taking away their power.
Daily Trojan Fall 2015 Editorial Board
Most of this article is far-left political-correctness babble, but DT staff got this right:  “Banning offensive language doesn’t get rid of the problem — it buries it under political correctness. Rather than regulate what can or can’t be said within an academic environment, universities should instead encourage honest conversations….” Well said, DT staff.
The concept of “Microagressions” may be politically correct, but it is a fatuous way to view offensive language. The problem is rudeness – a person is not “microscopically aggressive,” but is saying something offensive, although probably unwittingly. We all need to learn when we are being offensive, unknowingly or not. So the right response might be “that is a hurtful way to say whatever you are trying to say,” or perhaps, “I understand your meaning, but why say it that way?”
The world contains plenty of people who intend to be mean, insulting and overtly offensive in something they say. Responding to them appropriately is one matter. But in reacting to so-called “microaggressions” that may not be intentional, the best action is to induce the person to examine his or her words. That person may not want to offend, but will learn a helpful, if embarrassing, lesson on how poorly phrased wording can be hurtful to others.

Whether you’ve got your card loaded up with meal swipes and dining dollars or are still a little new to campus, here’s a breakdown to the many on-campus dining options USC has to offer.
Dining Halls 
First up: The dining halls. Most freshmen must purchase a large meal plan with many or unlimited meal swipes used at EVK, Parkside and Cafe 84. All dining halls serve food in an “all you can eat” buffet manner, complete with food stations that make custom orders like stir­fry. Their website or Facebook page lists theme nights as well; the restaurant transforms itself for the night and serves food authentic to a culture or nationality.
All dining halls offer students daily with options ranging from salad bars and sandwich stations to American comfort food like pasta, pizza, and burgers. Most other hot foods vary by night and hall; for example, one hall may be having a sandwich melt station while another dining hall is serving Chinese food such as orange chicken, rice, and noodles.
Campus Center 
But if you get tired of the same old sights and tastes of the halls (which may very well happen soon), put your discretionary and dining dollars to good use! The Ronald Tutor Campus Center hosts the perfect outdoor and indoor seating and dining area for students to enjoy meals, snacks and coffee while mingling with friends. On the lower level, students can dine at Seeds, one of my personal favorites, and order a preset or customized salad or sandwich. Seeds also offers homestyle food like mashed potatoes and sweets like cupcakes and gelato. In a rush to get to class? You can grab a premade or packaged snack or beverage and hit the registers as well.
Inside the center on the bottom floor, students can fulfill their fast­food cravings. Students can use their funds at The Habit, Verde, Panda Express and California Pizza Kitchen. In need of an iced coffee to cool off before heading back outside? Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is located right inside the center as well to your left as you walk in.
Seen those really big and magnificent stairs at Ronald Tutor as well? Take them straight up and you’ll find another great but pricier dining option. Lemonade is a great way to get a little bit of everything you want in a meal. The restaurant boasts a variety of fresh, seasonal salads (the Brussels Sprout & Parmesan Salad is one of my favorites), “land and sea” options, hot portions such as soup and mac n’ cheese, sandwiches and more. I usually skip the meat as it’s a little pricey, and indulge instead on something more flavorfully extravagant such as the butternut squash soup. The end of the line is the best —red velvet cupcakes, macaroons and, most importantly, the lemonade await. Though Lemonade is a fresh and vibrant dining option, just be wary of its heavier pricing.
TroGro, LiteraTea, Nekter and more 
A few other places that card money is worth using on include TroGro (the 24-hour Starbucks on campus), LiteraTea, Nekter, Little Galen and the Cafe inside of the Wallis Annenberg Hall building. As the year goes on, you’ll be sure to run into a few more hidden dining options and gems on campus that are crannied into certain buildings. Head to USC Hospitality for a full list of on-campus dining options. Don’t let your dining, discretionary or meal swipes go to waste!
Happy dining, Trojans!
