As the semester winds down, members of the Panhellenic and Intrafraternity councils have begun preparing for their upcoming election season,
The Panhellenic Council Thursday announced the presidential and executive vice presidential candidates for its elections, which will be held on Nov. 23.
Laura Redfern, current vice president of communications for Panhellenic, and Hilary Veit, vice president of recruitment, are slated to be next year’s president and executive vice president candidates.
The council annually conducts an application and interview process for students interested in the 12 open positions for the 2010 calendar year, and then “slates” or unofficially chooses candidates to fill the various posts.
On election night, which will take place this year at the Delta Delta Delta sorority house, the slated candidates will deliver speeches about their plans for the upcoming year.
Applicants who were not slated will also have the opportunity to challenge a slated candidate for the position. Delegates from each sorority chapter and the sitting Panhellenic board members will then elect the new board members.
“Every year the board has just gotten stronger,” said Blessing Waung, president of Panhellenic. “The true legacy that you can leave behind on an organization is just seeing how the new board can take over from where we left off.”
Waung said she hoped the new council would continue the current administration’s focus on service, through events like the All-Greek Service Day, as well as work with the university to improve safety.
The Interfraternity Council, meanwhile, will hold elections for its new board members on Dec. 2.
IFC is currently looking for candidates who are focused on progress and moving forward with the university’s goal of producing well-rounded students, said Gabe Worgaftik, vice president of public relations.
“Right now you’ll see that the university and the Greek system are kind of at a crossroads … So we want to make sure the people who are on IFC are truly being leaders in the Greek community,” Worgaftik said.

Before they start filling in scantron sheets for their final exams, students in departments across the university will have to fill in slightly different forms — teacher evaluations.
Those evaluations, though often viewed by students as either a pain or a chance to vent frustrations, are taken seriously by the university — student reviews can directly affect an instructor’s salary, job security and promotion opportunities.

“Students have the capacity to give an unbiased review of faculty performance,” said Michael Quick, executive vice dean of academic affairs for the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. “They’re in a position to give an unbiased strengths and weaknesses review.”
At the end of every semester, students are asked to review their professors. Those reviews are then passed on to the instructor usually six to eight weeks after the end of the semester.
Those reviews are also used by administrators during the annual merit performance and tenure reviews for faculty.
John O’Brien, senior associate dean of academic affairs in the Viterbi School of Engineering, said student evaluations are the “biggest single piece” of the review process.
The decision to offer tenure is based on teaching and research, as well as service to the university, Quick said. Typically, professors must split their efforts into 40 percent teaching, 40 research and about 20 percent service.
For professors who have already earned tenure, student evaluations affect the teaching aspect of their review, O’Brien said.
“In terms of evaluating people in the classes, we don’t say, ‘They’re tenured, so why even look?’” Quick said.
Instructors who are non-tenure track may receive a job promotion as a result of a positive annual report, said O’Brien, though they will never acquire a tenure position as a result of student evaluations.
Quick noted, however, that evaluations are not the only factor that determines an instructor’s fate, and administrators recognize that students’ reviews can sometimes be biased.
“Oftentimes, you have to be careful because evaluations can be based on things other than performance,” he said. “If a faculty member was really hard on me and I got a ‘C,’ they got a poorer evaluation from me than if I got an ‘A.’”
Because the student evaluations carry a significant amount of weight, Quick said students should think through their comments before filling out the forms.
“We wish students would take more time to fill these things out because it helps us out, and we really do value the comments,” Quick said.
Beyond tenure and performance reviews, student evaluations can help or hurt professors in other ways.
Nicholas Warner, a professor of physics, math and astronomy in the College, said teachers in his department receive a pay raise based on positive evaluations.
“There is a financial consequence to your evaluation,” he said. “Even though it’s small every year, over time it builds up hugely.”
As an indirect benefit, Warner said he uses his students’ comments to gauge how he should run his class the next semester.
“If there’s a number of people who make the same comment, I adjust the class according to it,” he said.
Jieying Zhang, an assistant professor for accounting in the Marshall School of Business, said she takes her students’ comments to provide a better learning experience for her students in the upcoming semesters.
“Every year I try to incorporate more examples and practice in class. The comments do help,” she said.
But some faculty members said they do not receive any direct benefits from a positive student evaluation.
“I think it helps me in that I always rate high with the students,” said John Cyrus Smith, an adjunct lecturer in the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. “It helps my reputation with Annenberg. It doesn’t affect salary. It certainly never affected mine.”
Liana Stepanyan, a lecturer in the Spanish and Portuguese department in the College, said her students’ evaluations regarding her performance affect neither her salary nor her likelihood of promotion.
“The only influence in the past 10 years was the summer classes,” she said. “Summer classes were assigned based on the student evaluations. The higher you rank the more likely you are to get a class.”
Still, students said they appreciated that their feedback could have an impact.
Joe Rothenberg, a sophomore majoring in animation, said he appreciates the opportunity to give his professors feedback.
“I’m glad that the teachers have incentive to perform well,” he said.

In an effort to educate students about the various facets of health care reform, a student group held a panel discussion Thursday featuring experts who attempted to explain the issues in simple terms.
Daily Trojan
The panel, held at Taper Hall by the USC chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group, included various experts on the issue including USC professors, a CalPIRG advocate and California State Assemblyman Mike Davis. For CalPIRG, the event was an opportunity to get students to relate to a national debate that might otherwise go over their heads.
“The most important thing, as a citizen, is to be educated,” said Yvette Ferrer, the chair of USC CalPIRG who helped organize the event. “The health care debate can seem obtuse, and it’s often hard to grasp what’s going on. We’re hoping to make this issue more personable to the students.”
Each panelist presented a different aspect of the issue of health care reform for the audience of about 55, covering the basics of the legislation being proposed by Congress, the problems of the country’s uninsured population and the difficulty of changing the system.
“One of the most important things to look at with health care reform is how it relates to America’s core values,” Davis said. “Do we really value the health care of our citizens?”
Davis made the argument that the country needed some version of a universal health care system that holds employers accountable, prompting questions and debate from students and other experts on the panel.
“The biggest problem is the lack of a system to control the cost of health care,” said Michael Cousineau, an associate professor at the Keck School of Medicine. “This might undermine our goal of universal coverage.”
Cousineau, also attempted to make the debate relevant for college students by explaining the need for and nuances of health insurance.
“The age group with the highest percentage without health insurance are those from 18 to 25,” Cousineau said. “The reason why is, they have no job, they just got out of college, it can take months to get coverage and they have choose between offers.”
Each panelist’s presentation was followed by a question-and-answer session, covering other facets of the debate such as how abortions are covered in the new legislation and what students can do to create change in health care reform.
Although the questions often led to debates between the panelists, Ferrer said she believes offering multiple views is an important part of making health care reform a more tangible, relevant issue for students.
But Geoffrey Joyce, an associate professor of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Economics & Policy and director of Health Policy at Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC, said he is unsure about the effectiveness of such events for students.
“These educational programs are valuable, but they only reach people who are receptive to learning about it,” Joyce said. “They simply won’t educate a large fraction of the student population.”
Still, Joyce was pleased that a part of the panel focused on insurance, saying it was the most important facet of health care reform pertaining to students.
“The problem with this [individual mandate on health insurance] is that many students are young and healthy, and the premiums they’ll have to pay will be higher than the expected benefits,” Joyce said.
A number of students who
attended the event said they had learned more about the national debate from the panel.
“Each panelist did a great job of providing thorough explanations of health care reform,” said Andrenna Hidalgo, a junior majoring in political science.
Rebecca Braun, a freshman majoring in international relations, said she appreciated the multiple viewpoints presented in the session.
“I really like how the different panelists all offered different perspectives on the issue,” Braun said. “I have a much more informed and
well-rounded opinion about health care reform.”
Representatives from CalPIRG said they thought the panel had been a successful way of bringing the health care debate to students in a fair manner.
“The student turnout was more than I was expecting, and it was nice to see the various viewpoints on the issue,” said Ravi Mahesh, a sophomore majoring in economics and political science who helped organize the event. “In the end, I feel like it was up to the audience to decide how they felt about [health care reform].”
Right on Joe!  Taken it to the man!  The DT is filled with leftist propaganda that only stops on the sports page.
Another amateurish report from our campus rag.  How can you write an entire article about CalPIRG without mentioning their ultra-liberal political agenda?  This group, and their event, certainly weren’t interested in “educating” people but in convincing them, and to not mention it either makes you complicit or clueless.  You should have picked up on the fact that CalPIRG kept changing the message — first it was about “core values”, then about “controlling costs”, then about “universal coverage”.  A reporter who doesn’t report on obvious used-car-salesman tactics isn’t worth the paper he’s printed on.

When President Steven B. Sample steps down in August, he’ll undoubtedly be remembered for his focus on USC’s international presence and for dramatically increasing the number of international students at the university.
Earlier this week, it was announced that USC, once again, hosts more international students than any other university in the United States — a mark the school first reached under Sample’s leadership eight years ago.
“It’s become more important since Sample has been president, but the tradition goes back much further,” said Adam Powell, USC’s vice provost for globalization. “In the first class in 1880, there was a student from Japan. You could argue that from the very first class, USC was already well ahead of the curve.”
USC hosted 7,842 international students last year. Indian students made up the largest population, followed by Chinese students.
Under Sample’s guidance, USC has seen a large increase in the number of students from the Pacific Rim, and its reputation there has drastically improved.
Sample said having a large international populations helps foster a multicultural environment and provides a better learning experience — not only for the students from overseas, but for domestic students as well.
“I think we might well be the dominant military power, scientific, cultural power, but [that’s] not uncontested and not unchallenged, so that’s one reason I think its so important for our domestic students to go to college with a lot of international students,” Sample said. “We’re not doing it for the international students, we’re doing it for our own, because Americans are the most provincial people of any industrial nation in the world.”
Powell said USC has been able to grow its international population because of its burgeoning reputation and alumni network abroad, both fostered by Sample.
“We’re finding, every August, a couple of things that are new. Parents and even grandparents are dropping off their sons and daughters. We have second, third generation Trojans from the Middle East, from Europe, from the Pacific Rim,” Powell said. “We have a huge Trojan family overseas, and this begins to spread the word of how good the USC experience is.”
USC’s active recruitment abroad helps create both interest and awareness among international students.
Matthew Leung, a sophomore majoring in business and executive director of Undergraduate Student Government’s Program Board’s International Student Assembly, is a citizen of Hong Kong. He wanted to go to college abroad, and looked at schools in the United States as well as the United Kingdom, but said USC’s active recruitment pushed him to come here.
“USC is special in that they have a lot of offices around the world, and an office in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong recruitment team came to my school, and if it weren’t for that office, I wouldn’t know about USC,” he said. “It’s pretty well known in foreign countries compared to other schools. Basically USC has a better reputation abroad.”
Domestic students said having a large international population adds to their experience at USC.
Haley Batis, a sophomore majoring in business administration,  went to Beijing for the Marshall School of Business’s Global Leadership Program, and said she met a lot of USC’s international students while on the trip.
“By having a large international community on campus it is promoting a stronger work ethic and creates greater competition,” Batis said.
Cameron Mabrie graduated from USC last year with a degree in political science, and is now at UC Berkeley for law school. He said international students that were in his classes offered a different educational perspective.
“They often presented an interesting perspective on issue and topics,” Mabrie said. “In classes where political systems were studied, it was interesting to see their views on our system in comparison to their country’s system.”
Some, however, say the growing number of international students may not be all positive, because of the economic implications — some say international students take resources away from domestic students, only to return to their home country.
“The idea is that they’re just using us to get an education, then using their skills to better the businesses in their country,” Batis said.
Powell points to post-9/11 security and visa regulations as a major deterrent to students staying in the United States upon graduation.
“It’s really a loss. Patents, artistry — so much of the strength of the US, including economically, has been due to men and women who come to the US for education and then stay,” Powell said. “Increasing numbers of students do return home. Governments around the world are encouraging students, with significant financial and other incentives, to return home from the US after their degree.”
Leung said, however, he doesn’t foresee obtaining a visa as being a challenge for him, at least, because of embassy aid and good relationships. He’s unsure of where he’ll go when he graduates, but for reasons not unlike those that domestic students consider.
“I don’t know, it depends on where I get a decent job,” Leung said.
“some say international students take resources away from domestic students, only to return to their home country.”
don’t you know that international students pay full tuition and are not eligible for most of the scholarships? International students are treated as the money tree by US colleges…
Wow. I am surprised to read the concern of foreign students returning home. Usually it is foreign students graduating and taking American jobs that worries the media and the public.
“Taking American jobs…” is called “competition.” Suck it up.
