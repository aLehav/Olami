We all feel better when we do something healthy for our bodies. It’s just a fact. But I think most of us know the difficult feeling of trying to bring yourself to get up early to go on a run. I bet half of you are nodding your head thinking back to the few hundreds of times that you pressed snooze—only then to realize that you ended up missing your 11 am class. Whoops!
Getting up early to go on a run is better for your body. It reenergized you after 8 hours of lying down and jumpstarts your entire day off the get go. According to LiveStrong, running in the morning can actually provide extra psychological and physiological benefits that help speed your progress throughout the entire day. This means that you actually may preform better on your tests and homework if you get your blood moving early in the morning. You are giving your body that extra bit of energy it would not of gotten otherwise. It also clears up time in your day for when you would have been working out and it increases your productivity.
Here are some good tips of ways you can stay motivated early in the morning and get yourself out of bed to get your blood pumpin’.
1. Find the right route. If you find a nice running path or area you like to run in, then it is much easier to motivate yourself to do it. You not only enjoy the experience more, but it is way better than running around the same track for an hour over and over again.
2. Go to bed early. This is just an obvious. If you are not tired, then getting up in the morning will not be as difficult as it would be if you were to not get the proper amount of zzzzz’s.
3. Open the blinds, get the daylight burning. Light actually wakes you up physically and if you see bright light coming it your body’s sleep mode will begin to shut off.
4. Sleep in the clothes that you will run in. If you are already in them it is easier to just get up and go. Also, you will feel very guilty if you don’t get up and you slept in your clothes.
5. Have a yummy breakfast waiting for you. Bribe yourself and also treat yourself with something at the end of the day if you woke up early to run. Having incentive gives you motivation.
6. Move your alarm clock far away from reach so you have to get out of bed. It really, really works. Once you’re up, you’re up!
7. Buy cute new workout gear. If you look good you do good. Also if you spent the money on the clothes you will want to use them.
8. Run with a friend who will motivate you. This is the greatest way to get yourself up in the morning. If you know that a friend is relying on you and will motivate you then you aren’t in it alone.

It is only the end of April, but the sun has begun to rise hot and white in the sky. The new freshmen have begun to settle comfortably into the routine of university life. They’ve finalized their schedules, but more importantly, they’ve begun to finalize their club memberships.
Unlike American college students, who can hardly be seen for all the deadlines piled atop of them, the life of a Japanese student tends to center in upon their involvement in a club or interest circle. Most circles meet at least once or twice a week, and the relationship between members is at once distant and close. Junior club members are expected to treat their seniors with respect. Senior members are expected to take care of their juniors and in many cases treat them to small snacks and meals. It’s a hierarchy that recalls family relations, but a hierarchy nonetheless.
Last weekend was the 新歓合宿 (shinkan gasshuku), or “welcome trip” of a circle that I myself am interested in. We went up to Kiyosato which is famed as a highland resort. There, we visited a farm and learned to make ice-cream from fresh milk and ran our hands along the bristly pelts and smooth noses of the cows. (One of the upperclassmen, looking at the bovine drool running along my arms and hands, immediately pointed me to a sink.) We listened (a bit cruelly) to the sizzling of beef on a barbeque grill. We drank until late at night and then woke up early in the morning for a hike along the brown trees and green hills of Kiyosato.
Being shy, I didn’t speak very much the entire trip, but noticed instead the small acts of kindness club members performed for one another. At meals, everyone made sure to pour water for everyone else. Hardly anyone was left to sit alone. At the farm, one of the third years made sure to offer to treat me to a drink as a new member—though, being the same age, I couldn’t bring myself to accept the favor. Though there is still a lot about Japanese social activities and customs that I am not used to, I can’t helped but be moved by the bonds that are often formed between members of the same circle.

The USC Human Powered Vehicle Design Team, founded at the beginning of the fall 2014 semester sponsored by the Viterbi School of Engineering placed in the top 10 for every competition with a 3rd place ranking in the endurance event during a competition hosted by the Santa Clara Valley Senior Section of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
The Human Powered Vehicle Challenge competition, held this past weekend in San Jose, California, hosted 36 teams from universities across the nation. The purpose of the competition is to design and create the best human powered vehicle with various requirements.
Brook Hammerschmidt, the founder and president of the team, started the design team so he could get hands-on experience in the field of mechanical engineering.
“I was kind of getting bored of my classes,” said Hammerschmidt, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. “I was doing well in my classes and I just wanted more of a challenge. I’m always into bicycling and stuff like that, and racing. I was originally going to join formula racing but it was so saturated, there was so many people but not enough tasks to do so I wanted to start my own team.”
Andrew Cull, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said he faced a couple of challenges while trying to manage the team.
“One of the biggest challenges I faced was organizing and getting everyone together and involved,” Cull said. “Getting stuff done on time when you needed something done from another member of the team.”
Cull said there are currently two models of the vehicle and the second model is a lot lighter than the first without the unnecessary components from the first model.
Trevor Nelson, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said he learned so much from being on the team than from lectures.
“Being an engineer is a lot more than just what you learn in being in classes so the theoretical knowledge that you get, there is going to be a huge disconnect after you graduate and start working,” Nelson said. “It’s not all going to be directly applicable. This is a great opportunity for engineers because it allows them to finally put what they’re learning to use in something that’s real and tangible.”
Ethan Sox, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, agreed with Nelson.
“A lot of the classes at Viterbi are theoretical, so with design teams like this, you get a lot of hands-on experience with building things with your hand,” Sox said.
Cull commented on the importance of joining a team like his as an engineer.
“This is important for Viterbi because this is what engineers are expected to do nowadays,” Cull said. “They said that if you just have a 4.0, no one is going to like you as an applicant because it’s kind of boring. They want you to have design team experience or some kind of out of class experience and that’s what we offer.”
