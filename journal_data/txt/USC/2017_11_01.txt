One of the first things that stands out about Laura Mosqueda’s office its sheer size. Large glass windows offer a wide view of the Health Sciences Campus and downtown Los Angeles, and a large conference table sits at the end of the spacious, rectangular room. 
As the interim dean of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Mosqueda occupies a position that has been associated with troubling events. 
However, her recent appointment on Oct. 6 signifies a new future for the school, as she seeks to stimulate open discussions about how Keck can recover and move forward during her time as interim dean. 
“One of our strengths here is just this superb education that our students get because they get exposed to a huge variety of people,” Mosqueda said. “We have a diverse faculty, and we also have both the county hospital and other kinds of opportunities for our students so that they get exposed to a diverse group of patients to care for.”
Prior to her appointment, Keck students expressed concern on how the school should move forward and prevent future issues with faculty. Mosqueda is aware that improvements must be made to address these worries. 
“I really admire what I’ve heard from the students here,” Mosqueda said. “They’ve had appropriate concerns and have been, for the most part, very respectful and thoughtful in terms of the questions they’re asking. And that’s what we want, right? That’s those are the kinds of physicians that we want out there.”
When it comes to moving forward and refocusing on Keck’s academic obligations, Mosqueda stresses the importance of open dialogue across the student body and faculty.
“I’d like to get advice from students and faculty and staff on how we can have more direct dialogues with each other,” she said. 
During the short time Mosqueda has served as interim dean, she has become the faculty advisor for the USC Student-Run Clinic and frequents trips with students to Skid Row and women’s shelters to provide urgent care. 
“There are three principles that I use to kind of guide myself,” Mosqueda said. “One of them is to do my best. The second is to do the right things for the right reasons. And the third is to keep focused on what’s important. And I think if we do all of those things, we’re in great shape. I’m really excited and optimistic about where we’re going and how we’re getting there.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate will vote next week on a proposal to make substantial changes to election rules. 
Director of Elections and Recruitment Emily Lee, who has been the primary facilitator of this proposal, emphasized two changes to the election process: the wellness and overall election experience of the candidates, and increased transparency in the election process.
Previously, the deadline for candidates to submit their essential campaign information was during finals week, which Lee said caused the candidates undue stress. The proposal would push this deadline a week into the future. The application for prospective candidates will also be open six days earlier than last year’s, starting Dec. 2. 
“I personally found it incredibly stressful to think that everything that you’re turning in, in the middle of finals week, was going to be what every other student was going to judge you on,” Lee said.
Furthermore, previous elections required signatures from fellow students in order to declare one’s candidacy. Lee saw this as an unnecessary and ineffective barrier to entry, and the proposal, she said, eradicates this requirement.
“Before, candidates were required to seek out a fixed number of signatures in order to be considered a valid candidate,” Lee said. “I know, for a fact, that these have been forged in the past. We want to make it as equal as possible for everyone, regardless of if you’re in USG or not, or have lots of friends, or [are] in a popular student organization.”
Lee said her call for increased transparency was partially due to the lack of implementation of the election guide.
“There was a previously stated elections handbook that never existed,” Lee said. “The voting guide is geared toward the general USC population and anyone interested in how to vote, who is running, their positions, and it is meant to be nonpartisan.”
She added that the changes proposed are necessary and overdue.
“I would best summarize it as making official changes that didn’t necessarily exist in the past, that should have,” Lee said.
While Lee acknowledges that she spearheaded the call for election changes, she said she reached out to former campaigners and other USG officials to advise her.
“I definitely didn’t want to make these decisions in a silo,” Lee said. “It wasn’t just a formality to reach out to the former campaigners.”
According to Lee, this is the largest election overhaul in several years. She and her team consulted over 20 universities’ election codes over the past two months and reached out to USC candidates from both the 2016 and 2017 election cycle.
“I like to think that this is a rather drastic set of changes and made for the better,” Lee said. 
This proposal is actually the third draft of the new election code, the first of which dates back to April.
Overall, Lee hopes these changes will improve the relationship between candidates and those who oversee USG elections. 
“Something I am personally very passionate about is just making this a more humane process, in that the elections team and the elections commission should not be in opposition to the candidates,” Lee said. “They should serve as a resource and that’s what I’m really aiming to do.”
EDITOR’S NOTE: This article has been updated to clarify the proposed dates for the USG election process.

The city of Los Angeles implemented Vision Zero, a citywide initiative, to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Photo by Rachel Parsons | Daily Trojan
Though many students take steps to protect themselves from violent crime in the USC area, there is another serious threat that is lesser-known: traffic accidents, which have killed 21 people in the area around campus since 2014. 
The city of Los Angeles has implemented efforts to reduce these fatalities. In 2015, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a citywide initiative called Vision Zero, administered by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. As part of this program, major changes are planned for the University Park neighborhood. 
“The core of Vision Zero is [to] better organize our streets so that you have less stress,” said Nat Gale, director of Vision Zero. “You can get from point A to point B without thinking that you’re going to have to take your life in your hands.” 
For the USC community, this means protected bike lanes are coming, high-visibility crosswalks including some diagonal crossings; tightened right lanes at intersections to slow cars turning right; and protected left-turn signals so cars are not making a left when pedestrians are crossing, according to Gale. 
The DOT analyzed five years’ worth of data to map the streets and intersections where the highest number of deaths and serious injuries occurred throughout the city. In the neighborhood immediately north of campus, Vermont Avenue, Jefferson and Adams boulevards and Hoover, 30th and Figueroa streets are all on the High Injury Network map. 
According to DOT data analyses, from 2014 through 2016, 21 people died in accidents and 96 were severely injured within a one-mile radius of USC. These numbers include pedestrians, cyclists and people in cars. 
In the immediate University Park area, three people, including one cyclist and one pedestrian, have been killed in the past three years, according to data provided through DOT’s online database. 
“I encounter close calls quite often,”‘ A’Ali’lkumakani Dukelow, a junior majoring in journalism, said in an email to the Daily Trojan. He lives north of campus and bikes about two miles to school. 
“It’s mostly when cars are turning and they don’t wait for pedestrians to cross the street,” Dukelow said. “I don’t feel safe crossing the street mostly anywhere around campus because it seems like most drivers here don’t want to wait for anyone.”
Dukelow said he always rides on the sidewalk. Bike riders are legally allowed to use sidewalks in Los Angeles as long as they exercise caution, according to the Los Angeles Municipal Code.
“In USC, one of our biggest projects, actually citywide, is called ‘My Figueroa,’” Gale said. “It’s a protected bike lane to get people from USC to Downtown and vice versa.” 
The project, currently under construction, will install a two-mile stretch of dedicated bike lane in both directions so students like Dukelow will be able to get off the sidewalk. Construction is scheduled for completion in December. 
“That physical separation actually makes the streets much better organized,” Gale said. “So you don’t have to guess when somebody on a bicycle is going to be coming because they’re physically protected.”
Features new to drivers and pedestrians, like diagonal — also called scramble —  crosswalks, have already arrived along Jefferson Boulevard at the intersections of McClintock Avenue and Hoover and Royal streets. 
The University has had limited involvement with the city for some of the safety upgrades. Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle said USC worked with the DOT on the redesign of the intersection at Jefferson Boulevard and Royal Street, where one of the scramble crosswalks was installed. But Carlisle pointed out that the streets around the campus are city property.
“It seems to me we’re fortunate we don’t have more injuries and more serious collisions than we do,” Carlisle said. “With the number of traffic violations that are occurring on a daily basis by pedestrians and cyclists, and drivers … we’re very supportive of any measures taken to reduce traffic fatalities, particularly when it comes to pedestrians and cyclists, because there are tens of thousands of them here at USC.” 
Caution to all Trojans, resist Vision Zero at all costs.  They will try to destroy your neighborhood.
When it’s your time, its your time!
God Bless!
