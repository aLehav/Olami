On Tuesday, a panel of experts discussed the potential impacts of new Russian legislation criminalizing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activity on the 2014 Sochi Olympics.
History lesson · Associate professor Robert English speaks to student Emily Huang about the consequences of anti-gay legislation in Russia. – Dasha Kholodenko | Daily Trojan
Panelists included Daniel Durbin, founder and director of the USC Annenberg Institute of Sports, Media and Society; Professor Robert English of the USC international relations department; and Emily Huang, a junior majoring in sociology and co-president of OUTreach.
The panelists looked back at similar situations in which a country has been dissatisfied with the host of the Olympics, and noted multiple failures to boycott the games.
In 1980, the United States boycotted the Russian Olympics because the country had just invaded Afghanistan, but the United States’ boycotting efforts were looked at as “ineffective” by the public. Many Americans reviewed the decision as one of President Jimmy Carter’s worst.
“It is often much more effective to go out to the Olympics and present your position either subtly or overtly,” Durbin said.
One of the problems with athletes publicly taking positions, according to the panelists, is that the Russian media almost never publishes any pro-gay rights statements by athletes, especially those from the West.
Despite intolerant policies in the country, international gay athletes might not need to worry about the Russian government trying to kick them out of the country for showing signs of homosexuality.
“It’s going to be almost impossible for Russia to say that these athletes are involved in propagandistic activity and kick them out of the country,” Durbin said.
Under Russian law, “homosexual propaganda” is outlawed, but exactly what that means is still under review in the country.
According to English, an expert on Russia and a former resident of the country, Russia should not be expected to be overly forceful during the time of the Olympics, especially considering that it is essentially the International Olympics Committee who has the power to decide who stays and who goes.
English noted that a lot of President Vladimir Putin’s anti-gay legislation stems from a late 1990s movement toward “Russian nationalism,” a movement toward the return of Russian roots, which is strongly supported by the Russian Orthodox Church.
“[The legistlation is] not admirable political leadership, but neither did [Putin] start it,” English said.
Even before Putin became president, groups in Russia were forming and demanding reform. According to the panel, these groups came about as a result of a poverty epidemic in Russia during which citizens fought for moral causes in an attempt to preserve their dignity.
Russian nationalist groups have also targeted Westerners, foreigners and women, as well as LGBT people. The experts pointed out that citizens of troubled countries often find scapegoats for their problems. Inequality in sports has also been a lasting issue.
“Sports have been gendered since our nation began,” Durbin said. Even in America, athletes faced segregation by race, gender and sexual orientation.”
Alec White, a sophomore majoring in political science, was upset that the Olympics were not moved out of Sochi in light of the anti-gay legislation, but also that countries such as the U.S. and France were not able to offer alternatives to boycotting the Russian Olympics.
“It would have been a great idea if this [anti-gay law] came up a little sooner,” White said. “Vancouver [would have been] a good compromise because you wouldn’t have the athlete’s dreams shattered.”

The weekly USG Senate meeting Tuesday night featured a presentation from USG’s wellness committee on student health concerns.
A major focus of the presentation was adding green space on campus. Assistant Director of Wellness Affairs A.J. Pinto said he is personally dissatisfied with the lack of open space for recreational activity.
“We’re the only school in the Pac-12 without significant amount of green space on campus or a field for recreation. It’s absolutely unheard of,” Pinto said.
Though there are tentative plans for recreational space in the new University Village, committee members worry that current students will not be able to enjoy these recreational benefits during their time at USC.
“I’m worried that improvements will take many years, and that students here now and students coming here in the next few years will never experience recreation and relaxation,” Pinto said. “I don’t want the UV to be used as a Band-Aid.”
The committee also talked about issues of overcrowding and faulty exercise equipment at the Lyon Center. The student gym experienced an unspecified cut to its funding in the new Student Affairs budget.
In open comments before the meeting adjourned, Greek Senator Jamie Dick announced that university officials have approved the installation of new sidewalks on 28th Street, also known as The Row, and that construction will begin immediately.

Legends Hospitality, the company that provides the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum’s concessions, plans to provide attedees with upgraded food options this football season.
Legends delivers food options that are rarely found at sports stadiums. According to the USC Athletic Department, fans can now purchase “freshly made sushi, pulled pork and chicken sandwiches, […] salads or wraps [and] box lunches from local area chefs.”
With clients such as the Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, the AT&T Stadium in Dallas and the Etihad Stadium in the United Kingdom, Legends is no stranger to iconic venues. Its partnership with USC, however, marks one of the company’s first college sports food contract.
The upgrades will come at a cost. According to the company, a meal will run around $20. For many students, that price is high enough to prevent them from eating at the stadium.
Erica Behrens, a sophomore majoring in international relations, appreciated the quality options, but said she is wary of the higher pricing.
“They had some really gourmet foods [that] you wouldn’t expect to see at a stadium,” she said. “French fries are $5. A bag of chips is $4. That’s a lot.”
With games that often last more than four hours, the cost of food and beverages feels exploitative to many students. A bottle of water now costs $5 at the Coliseum.
Director of USC Hospitality Kris Klinger decided to partner with Legends for two reasons: quality and variety.
“Our first goal was to improve the concessions and the overall fan experience,” Klinger said. “We did tastings with [Legends] on a lot of the new items. Even if you got just a traditional hot dog, it was better than it used to be.”
Those who choose to buy food at the stadium agree that the quality of the food has improved.
“I think they have a lot more options. I like that they have the bacon-wrapped hot dogs inside the stadium this year, ‘cause they don’t sketch me out as much,” said Ariel Hayward, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “The teriyaki chicken bowl, that was some good stuff.”
Many students who purchase food at the Coliseum might do so reluctantly. Brian Kelleher, a sophomore majoring in business administration, purchased a couple of snacks at the game against Utah State.
“I bought fries and a drink for $12.50. Anywhere else would be, like, $2,” Kelleher said. “I always buy stuff, but I question myself every time.”
Others’ problem with buying food has more to do with long lines than with high prices.
“I would buy something if I were really thirsty or hungry, but I prefer not to miss the game and wait in line. Especially to spend $7 on a hot dog,” Valen Crain, a sophomore majoring in economics, said.
Speeding up service is one of USC Hospitality’s priorities.
“We want to get folks in and out so they can get back to the game,” Klinger said.
Klinger predicts more people will start eating stadium food in the upcoming home games instead of lunching beforehand.  Once they get a chance to explore Legends’ concession stands, they will look forward to those treats on game days.
“I think it will build over time,” he said. “There are certain items in there that you know you’re going to go for.”

On Tuesday, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a forum led by this year’s Innovator-in-Residence, Aaron Koblin, an artist and designer specializing in data and digital technologies and the current leader of the Data Arts Team in Google’s Creative Lab.
Koblin was chosen to be this year’s Innovator-in-Residence by the research council of the Innovation Lab, a group of 14 professors from five schools at USC. As the Innovator-in-Residence, Koblin will give several public talks, co-teach classes, hold seminars with both researchers and students and have the Annenberg Innovation Lab focus its future research efforts.
“It’s refreshing and invigorating to come back to an academic environment and see what the students are working on,” Koblin said. “This is a nice opportunity to self-reflect and get different perspectives on things I’ve worked on from both faculty and students.”
Koblin’s work specifically takes real world and community-generated data and uses it to study and reflect on cultural trends and the changing relationship between humans and man-made systems.
“It was really interesting to learn about the intersections of communication and technology, and how crowd-sourcing is changing,” said David Tobia, a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.
During the seminar on Tuesday, Koblin presented various examples of his past real-world studies over the last several years, notably his collaborative drawing projects such as “The Sheep Market” and “Ten Thousand Cents” — both of which utilized the community, available technology and, in the end, human nature.
Koblin stressed that technology can enhance our humanity if used properly.
“I thought it was very interesting how a large part of all of his projects involved getting the community involved in a simple task, and then using his results to form a bigger picture [about the community],” said Runbo Chen, a first year graduate student studying public relations.
Koblin’s work is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. His projects have been shown at international festivals including TED and Ars Electronica. Koblin also received the National Science Foundation’s first place award for science visualization, and two of his music video collaborations have been Grammy nominated.
Koblin is no stranger to working at a university. In 2010, he was the Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at MIT.  He hopes to use his position to  help both students and faculty.
“Through the observations I’ve made while building my projects and throughout my career, I hopefully will be able to help people in their own career and project pursuits,” Koblin said. “I think it’s important for the discussion to be a true dialogue so that I can connect with the faculty and the students and hear what they have to say as well.”
Many students said they enjoyed the way Koblin incorporated both technology and art into his talk.
“The presentation was really cool, and Aaron is very talented at what he does,” said Jiangwen Hui, a first year graduate student studying public relations. “I really enjoyed the motion pictures, and how he was able to convert various still images into a moving presentation.”
For every motion picture part of the presentation, Koblin also had a point to make about culture.
“It was very interesting how he was able to make art from data, and to talk about culture and human nature in terms of technology and art,” said Shrota Sharma, a graduate student in planning.
Koblin received his master of fine arts in design and media arts from UCLA. When asked about how he felt contributing to his crosstown rival’s communication program, Koblin laughed, admitting that he had never been very interested in the rivalry.
“Truthfully, I never really subscribed too much to [the rivalry]. However, I do believe that all collaboration is key to advancement,” Koblin said. “The best creativity is often a result of two different perspectives and experiences coming together and working out — even if they started in different places.”

The USC Gould School of Law’s sixth annual “U.S. Supreme Court: A Preview” event was held Tuesday evening at USC’s Town and Gown. The event highlighted a discussion on Supreme Court cases that have occurred this year.
Laying down the law · Goodwin Liu, the associate justice of the California Supreme Court, speaks about the state of the Supreme Court at a panel hosted by the USC Gould School of Law on Tuesday evening at Town and Gown. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The event featured two prominent guest panelists: Gregory Garre, the 44th Solicitor General of the United States and The Honorable Goodwin Liu, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California. Rebecca Brown, Newton Professor of Constitutional Law at the Gould School, organized and marketed the event.
“We publicize it through the school. I talk to my students about it and now, after 5 years, it has a reputation that helps people get the word out,” Brown said.
She emphasized that all students can benefit from attending the event, regardless of major.
“We bring in two invited experts on the Supreme Court and the Constitution and we try to understand what we should be watching for in the upcoming term and why it’s important, why it matters, to all of us,” Brown said.
The event featured discussion on controversial docket cases, such as Greece, N.Y. v. Galloway, which challenged local clergy’s right to offer Christian prayers before a town’s monthly meetings, and McCullen v. Coakley, which contended that a buffer zone surrounding abortion clinics in Massachusetts infringed on First Amendment rights.
“It’s interesting understanding the past and future of Supreme Court cases because it’s something that most students, at least in my experience, aren’t exposed to on a day-to-day basis,” said Kyle Goguen, a graduate student in engineering management.
The issues focused on by the panelists are not only controversial, but also applicable to all citizens of the United States. The choice of docket cases to discuss represented issues that were important to the United States this year.
“This one [event] is specifically focused on the Supreme Court and I don’t know of any other event that does this, so, by definition, because the court is hearing those particular issues then it’s confined to those issues,” Brown said. “It’s not just any issues, it’s what is the court going to have on its docket and what do they expect to happen and what should we be watching for or thinking about.”
Many USC students and alumni who attended for various reasons found value in the presentation.
“The law affects everyone,” said Gonzalo Gambino, a senior majoring in industrial systems engineering.
Some students saw the event as a chance to meet and hear from high-profile panelists.
“Look at the names that make it out to our campus [and] the opportunities you have to hear from people like this,” said Francisco Iturbe, a senior majoring in civil engineering. Iturbe believes that this event will attract prospective students to USC because it not only benefits USC Gould School of Law’s reputation, but USC’s reputation as a whole.
Others thought it was a good opportunity to hear experts’ opinions on what cases were important this year.
Josefin Baldeh, a student in the USC Master of Law program, said it helped her “just get a hint of what’s important in the U.S. legal system.”

One glance into California Assemblymember Jones-Sawyer’s office and it’s not hard to guess where he went to college. A USC blanket hangs on the wall and a Trojan cup rests on his desk. There is certainly a strong sense of Trojan Pride here.
Trojan pride · USC alumnus and California State Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer speaks to the Daily Trojan in his office on Tuesday. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
In Nov. 2012, Jones-Sawyer, who graduated from USC in 1979 and later attended Harvard University, was elected to represent California’s 59th State Assembly District, which includes South Los Angeles, Florence-Firestone, Huffington Park and Walnut Park.
During his first year in office, Jones-Sawyer focused mainly on education and the availability of quality schooling.
Jones-Sawyer’s interest in education in part stems from his heritage. His uncle, Jefferson Thomas, was one of the original Little Rock Nine, a group of black students who were involved in the 1957 desegregation of Little Rock Central High School, an event that gained national attention.
“He was kicked, beaten, sworn at — they even burnt crosses on my grandfather’s home,” Jones-Sawyer said.
Jones-Sawyer interprets the struggle of his uncle to attend school and get an equal education as his impetus to improve the school system and help struggling Latino and African American youth in California.
“[My uncle] suffered through a whole lot so I could go to any school I wanted. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have been able to go to USC or Harvard,” he said.
According to Jones-Sawyer, the main reason many young people aren’t successful in today’s society is because they do not receive a proper education.
“My uncle almost died so we could give them the best education possible. And here we are in 2013, and California is failing in the school systems,” he said. “I’m here hopefully trying to reverse that.”
But Jones-Sawyer wasn’t always so passionate about learning. During his time at USC, Jones-Sawyer said he was spending too much time with his fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi.
Eventually, Jones-Sawyer’s grades suffered. After he ended up on academic probation, his grandmother sat him down in the kitchen and told him he could not “sacrifice this education.”
She told him a story she had never told anyone, about how in 1957 she was sitting in her kitchen when she received a threatening phone call.
“The voice on the other end said, ‘Get your son out of school or your grandson will never make it to school,’” Jones-Sawyer said. “She looked at me and said, ‘That grandson was you.’”
The next year, Jones-Sawyer went from academic probation to USC’s dean’s list; and since then, he has made sure not to squander his hard-earned education.
It is because of his uncle’s commitment to education and the struggle of his family to make a change in education that he decided to run for the Assembly.
“I decided I would give back and run for office. I wanted to make a difference in people’s lives because of that one day sitting in my grandmother’s kitchen,” Jones-Sawyer said.
Since then, he has graduated from USC with a bachelor of science in public administration, and then attended Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government for senior executives in state and local government program.
He went on to serve as assistant deputy mayor of Los Angeles, where he helped to develop the Magic Johnson Theater and the Staples Center.
In 2012, when the 59th Assembly District seat opened up, Jones-Sawyer decided to run for Assembly, and he said was eager to make a difference in the education of others.
“When I was younger, I wanted to be an elected official — every young boy wanted to be president, and my family has always taught me to reach for the stars,” he said.
Though he’s not president, Jones-Sawyer said being the Assemblymember for the 59th district comes pretty close.
The position makes him one of the 120 people who make decisions for 38 million California residents on a daily basis.
“I now have a great opportunity to make change — to make a change in the lives of people who are poor and not getting the best education,” he said.
Jones-Sawyer hopes to help move black and Latino men out of prison and into well-paying jobs. His goal is to stop the cycle of young men going back into the prison system.
It’s a solution sought through rehabilitation in contrast to incarceration, which Jones-Sawyer believes will solve  California’s problem of prison overcrowding.
A prisoner spending a year in jail costs taxpayers $55,000, according to Jones-Sawyer.
“[For that money], we could send someone to USC for four years and have them be a more productive member of society,” Jones-Sawyer said. “From a business perspective, it’s better to invest in people so they can get an education and learn a skill or get a college degree and then get a good, paying job.”
Another issue that Jones-Sawyer is passionate about is AB 549, a bill he authored, that encourages greater school safety guidelines for mental health professionals, school counselors and police officers on campuses. The bill is currently awaiting Governor Jerry Brown’s signature.
He believes that addressing delinquency problems in school will help prevent the incarceration of young men and women in the future.
Jones-Sawyer said he feels so strongly about education because he credits his own education at USC for much of his professional success.
“USC prepares you to be the CEO, to be president, to be superintendant of schools. USC prepares you to run the place, it takes you beyond just being good and prepares you to be great,” Jones-Sawyer said.

With round robin tournaments and nonconference play in the books, the USC women’s volleyball team will begin   Pac-12 play tonight when the team squares off against crosstown rival UCLA in what is primed to be a critical match to determine the conference hierarchy.
Stare down · USC sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio and the rest of the women’s volleyball team face a tough Pac-12 foe in No. 11 UCLA. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The No. 4-ranked Women of Troy (10-1) will put their  four-match winning streak on the line against the No. 11-ranked Bruins (9-1) in the 100th all-time meeting between the two L.A. rivals.
USC head coach Mick Haley noted that though his team has been playing sound volleyball through its first 11 games, UCLA has a distinct advantage that his own squad will have to combat.
“What I’m expecting to see [in UCLA] is a team that’s been practicing for eight weeks without having to go to school,” Haley said, referencing the quarter system that UC schools use. “I would think they’ll be very much in system and comfortable with what they’re trying to do.”
The Women of Troy have stormed out of the gates to start the season, their only loss coming at the hands of the University of San Diego two weeks ago in their final nonconference tournament. UCLA has been equally impressive, also stringing together four straight victories after a road loss to Hawai’i.
After the loss to USD, the Women of Troy have been particularly dominant, losing only one set in their last four matches.
“We had two weeks of preseason practice before school started, and then we traveled three weekends in a row, so we’re still trying to utilize our talent correctly and get a rhythm going,” Haley said. “I don’t think we’re anywhere close to being the product we can be by the end of the season. UCLA should be far ahead of us and that’s the way it usually is with these quarter schools.”
The Women of Troy received a scare against Cal State Fullerton on Friday when junior setter Hayley Crone left the match in the third set after suffering an injury. Fortunately, Haley confirmed that she has recovered and will participate in tonight’s match.
“She got [hit] in the head and got into a collision after that with another player,” Haley said. “It scared her and she started to hyperventilate and they checked her out for a concussion, but she looks to be 100 percent and she had a good practice today.”
Haley’s team is coming off a strong performance against the Titans in which they cruised to a 3-0 victory despite Crone’s injury and inconsistent play in the third set. Though the Bruins represent a tough challenge, Haley is familiar with the Bruins’ system thanks to his 12 years of experience as USC’s head coach.
“They have senior [outside hitter] Kelly Reeves, who played on a China tour with me and did a nice job for us,” Haley said. “She’s a good passer and is a very experienced player who can be a swing hitter on either side. They’ve got two returning players in the middle and they count on junior [outside hitter] Karsta Lowe to be their top point-getter.”
Despite the success they’ve enjoyed in the beginning portion of the season, the Women of Troy will have much to work on to continue this success against strong Pac-12 opponents like the Bruins.
“We have to overcome quite a bit to stay with these quarter schools that don’t start school until late September,” Haley said. “UCLA has a system just like ours, but they look like they’re in a much better rhythm than we are now, so the concern is whether we can sustain a rhythm. They have some things that they’re working on, but we can’t worry too much about UCLA right now because we have to work on getting better every day.”
Tipoff for tonight’s game at the Galen Center is scheduled for 7 p.m., and the game will be broadcast on ESPNU.

USC is a football school. It always has been, and always will be. No matter how many consecutive national championships the men’s water polo team wins (five), All-Americans the USC women’s volleyball team has (two in 2012) or supermodel wives the USC men’s basketball coach marries (one), Saturdays at the Coliseum will always be the biggest event on campus.
At least for those who actually attend the games.
But as USC continues to fade from football relevance, fans aren’t heading out to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum early. Instead, they’re not even showing up at all. The announced attendance for USC’s game two weeks ago against Boston College was 62,006, which was the lowest figure in a decade. Even after throttling the Eagles, last week’s announced attendance against Utah State was 63,482 with the actual figure looking closer to 50,000. A two-thirds full Coliseum, however, does not mean a similarly proportioned decline in fan support.
It seems stunning considering that the Coliseum consistently led USC to the highest average attendance in the Pac-10/12 during the Pete Carroll era, but USC is slowly losing its home field advantage.
Besides the bottom two rungs of the student section and a smattering of sections on the north side of the stadium, the only other section that appeared more than 75 percent full last Saturday was the one filled with Utah State fans. After leading the Pac-12 with an average attendance of 87,945 last year, USC is averaging just 67,770 fans in 2013’s first three games.
One would hope the attendance figures and negative energy from the stands wouldn’t affect the team’s on-field product, but Trojan players aren’t oblivious, and they are taking note of the growing number of empty seats.
“Yeah [we notice], but we try not to pay attention to that,” sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams said on the slowly dwindling number of fans in the seats after last Saturday’s win. “We just come here and play ball.”
At USC, however, the on-field performance is more than just playing ball. USC wins, and the campus is chipper on Monday. USC loses, and the weekend is ruined. Yet this 4-6 stretch USC is currently on has not just dampened the mood for many, but put out the fire.
No doubt, part of USC’s poor attendance is indicative of Los Angeles’ “What have you doing for me lately?” reputation as a sports town. Yet the on-campus reaction has shifted from disappointment to acceptance.
Instead of relief on Monday after that 17-14 squeaker over Utah State, the mood across the university was more aligned with indifference. Even with a win, the student body (or at least, many of the students) expressed the belief that 2013 is a lost season with nine games still left. Student tickets were being given away by the time last Saturday’s game rolled around, as the market for USC tickets looks to have hit a recession.
There’s no shortage of dedicated Trojans fans. A quick glance at a tailgate or various USC message boards online will dispel any doubts. Still, the recent lack of attendance has made a divide palpable.
“The true fans are here, and I’m thankful for them,” junior linebacker and team captain Hayes Pullard said after the last game.
It’s a bitter dilemma. As detestable as it might be, the better the Trojans play, the more likely the Coliseum is to see fans pour back in. The UCLA and Stanford games will inevitably draw big crowds regardless, but in the minds of many, there’s little motivation to attend home games against Utah and Arizona if the on-field product remains marred in mediocrity.
And mediocrity looks par for the course right now. The Trojans’ defense is ranked up there with the nation’s best, but USC’s offense is ranked No. 93 out of 125 FBS teams with 22.3 points per game, and the Trojans rank No. 108 with 340 total yards of offense per game. Only five teams from the BCS conferences have fared worse than that, one of them being Boston College. Combine excellent and awful, and you come up with average.
After three tumultuous weeks at home, the Trojans head to the desert this weekend to take on Arizona State. It’ll be another two weeks after that before the next home game against Arizona. Either USC will be 4-1 and possibly back in the national polls with fans eager to cheer on a winning team, or 3-2 and already focusing on racking up enough wins to make a bowl game. It’s as simple as this: Play well for 60 minutes, and all might be forgiven. All it takes is one game. USC is, after all, a football school.

It is difficult to go forward looking in the rearview mirror. 
USC is becoming and many would assert is an academic powerhouse. Perhaps it is possible to be an academic powerhouse and have an excellent football program, but not be viewed as a “football school”. 
Stanford is currently ranked 5 in the nation in football and about 5 academically. Is Stanford a “football school”? Of note, during a recent televised Stanford home game the announcer commented. “where are all the students, what a thin crowd”
USC’s academic ranking now exceeds its football ranking. Some will see this as cause for celebration, others a cause for lament. Perhaps it is best for all to strive in the endeavors to have USC considered as an all-around excellent institution.

USC continued preparation for its critical Pac-12 showdown with Arizona State on Tuesday, and the focal point of the day was on slowing down the Sun Devils’ vaunted front seven and trying to develop consistency among the Trojans’ sputtering offense.
Big test · USC’s offensive line will face its most daunting challenge of the season when it goes up against ASU and its All-American defensive tackle Will Sutton. USC rank No. 98 in the country in tackles for loss allowed. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Unfortunately, we haven’t been clicking on all cylinders,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said. “At times, we’ve been moving the ball. I do feel like we’ve run the ball more consistently than we did a year ago, but we don’t throw the ball as well as we did a year ago.”
TOUGH ADJUSTMENTS
Through its first four games of the season, USC has scored a total of seven points in the third quarter, a trend that would suggest an inability to adjust to opposing defenses coming out of the locker room after halftime.
But Kiffin said he doesn’t view the lack of third quarter scoring as an indication that his team fails to make adjustments, but rather as a coincidental footnote.
“The [whole] game is [about] adjustments,” Kiffin said. “You’re always making adjustments, [whether it’s] in between series or between plays. For whatever reason, we’ve scored more points in the second quarter and the fourth quarter than we have in the first and third.”
Against ASU, the focus will be on simply scoring points, regardless of which quarter they come in. The Trojans have failed to develop a strong rhythm so far this season on the offensive side of the ball, particularly in the passing game. USC ranks No. 110 in the nation in passing offense per game.
“[Scoring] is not gonna be easy,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “They’re a really good defense and they have a lot of good players. We just have to stick to what we do and keep working and be really disciplined up front.”
Against Utah State in particular, the USC passing attack was far less effective in the second half then in the first, continuing the Trojans’ tendency to become easier to defend in the latter part of games.
“[Utah State] made good adjustments and played us really well in the second half,” Kessler said. “But we just missed some big plays on offense, especially in the passing game. [Consistency] just comes with more experience in games.”
GROUND CONTROL
Though the Trojans’ aerial attack has been less than stellar, the team has run the ball more efficiently than it did all of last season, despite last year’s leading rusher, senior tailback Silas Redd, still recovering from a knee injury.
USC’s strong running attack has been so effective thanks to the emergence of the team’s two young tailbacks, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis, who have averaged just over 150 combined rushing yards per game.
Despite their lack of experience, Kiffin has not felt the need to taper the offense’s reliance on the duo. Madden has averaged 22.5 carries per game so far, and Davis, who has not yet turned 18, is second on the team with eight carries per game.
“No,” Kiffin said when asked if he was concerned about leaning too heavily on Madden and Davis. “Tre has shown really good ball security, which is what you worry about when their carries get up there. Justin is still young, so there are some ball security issues there. We’re still working on it, but we have to do whatever it takes to win.”
Madden relishes his extended opportunities and appears to be more than comfortable as the focal point of the USC offense.
“Definitely not,” Madden said when asked if he was being overworked. “I’m just looking week-by-week and trying to improve and stay healthy. I’m staying in the training room, rehabbing, and I feel good every week.”
The USC offensive line will be tasked with stopping ASU All-American defensive tackle Will Sutton, who was ranked No. 2 in the Pac-12 in sacks in 2012 but has yet to record a sack this season.
“He’s a great player,” junior center Marcus Martin said. “You just have to watch a lot of film on the guy. He’s a great pass rusher and great run stopper, so you just have to come out and play our tails off.”
LIONS’ SHARE
Kiffin and USC Athletic Director Pat Haden were both diplomatic in their responses to news about Penn State’s NCAA sanctions being reduced on Tuesday. Kiffin felt empathy for Penn State head coach Bill O’Brien, who inherited the program under tumultuous conditions.
“I was happy for them,” Kiffin said. “I don’t sit around and root against other people. I’m happy for Coach [O’Brien] and for their players. We know what [dealing with scholarship losses] is like … there’s a lot of challenges that come with it.”
Redd, who transferred to USC from Penn State prior to the 2012 season after the punishments were announced, expressed similar sentiments upon hearing the news.
“Whether [Penn State fans] believe it or not, they still mean a lot to me,” Redd said. “I spent two good years there, and those are years that I’ll never forget. They’ll always have a place in my heart, whether they believe it or not, but I know how I feel about them.”

As is to be expected these days, Drake’s highly anticipated third studio album Nothing Was The Same leaked days ahead of its scheduled Sept. 24 release date. The Toronto-born Aubrey “Drake” Graham — rapper, singer and former Degrassi star — has just as dedicated and diverse a fanbase as he does disparagers. The root of the issue is the cultural dichotomy that Drake has created and attempted to refute. He is capable of representing a wide array of narratives as a result of his middle-class Canadian upbringing and child stardom, which clashes with the street-relevant, thug masculinity he often projects.
Thank him later · Toronto-based emcee Drake returns with his deeply personal and emotional style of hip hop on Nothing Was the Same. – Courtesy of Universal Music Group
 
Drake’s self-ascribed love for women is also at odds with his misogynistic grouping of women into a few discernable categories and character types. These dualities plague listeners who wish to defend his authenticity and torture those who question the very nature of his success. Most interestingly, though, Drake seems obsessively self-aware of these notions.
The album’s opening track is “Tuscan Leather,” a massive six-minute introduction track during which Drake frequently reiterates the rhetorical question “How much time is this n—a spending on the intro?” It’s one of the weaker tracks on the album, as Drake repeatedly and exhaustingly tells us all the things he insists he doesn’t have to tell us — how rich and relevant he is. It’s only about halfway through the track that the beat changes and he gets down to the nitty gritty, discussing feeling misunderstood and his recent lack of communication with his good friend, Nicki Minaj.
Much of Drake’s lyrical content involves the rapper’s favorite topic: himself. In the second track, “Furthest Thing,” he describes himself as somewhere in between “psychotic and iconic.” These fascinating moments of self-analysis are countered by moments in the track when Drake’s sincere concerns and insecurities push him into off-putting defensiveness.
Drake delves into his unique relationship dynamics on “Own It,” which, to Drake’s credit, does not allow for passive listening. The rapper waxes poetic about the difficulty of finding a genuine relationship for someone in his position of fame. He professes his persistent desire to turn a physical relationship into a substantial romantic one, and Drake puts his listeners in the moment with his personal lyrics: “Next time we f-ck, I don’t wanna f-ck, I wanna make love / Next time we talk, I don’t wanna just talk, I wanna trust / Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin’ for you.”
But Drake is at his best when his lyrics depart from talking about himself. “From Time” is one of the only tracks on the album featuring a singer and is easily the best song on the album. Up-and-coming vocalist Jhene Aiko, with whom Drake has collaborated with on several occasions, pines for our protagonist. The sweetness of Aiko’s vocals complements Drake’s lyrical treatment of his relationship with his father, his mother’s illness and relationships with women from his past that bring him to question his self-worth.
“Connect” sees Drake once again trading in his tough-guy rapper persona for vulnerability as he delves into the difference between “real” relationships and those that are toxic. Drake’s lyrics on “Connect” are an indictment on materialistic money-grubbing females. He implores such women to “learn to love people and use things / And not the other way around.” Drake channels the flow he used as a featuring artist on the Migos hit “Versace” on “The Language,” a well-crafted club banger.
Drake tips his hat to hip-hop legend Jay Z on “Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,” where the two rappers muse about fame over a soaring “C.R.E.A.M.”-sampling instrumental. Undoubtedly Drake is inviting at least some comparisons to the Brooklyn emcee, if not proclaiming himself to be on a similar plane. Despite this, Drake eschews his competitive side on “Too Much,” a track featuring Sampha which Drake premiered on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. His tone on the track is similar to “From Time,” as Drake admits that he needs to “take a deep breath” and stop worrying about “being the best out” in a genre that always invites comparison and competition.
For the active listener, Drake is at his best when he’s making his music approachable and deeply personal. At his worst, his attempts to embody what he believes to be “real” (and, consequently, marketable) are counterproductive. For some, the album might be destined for success or doomed from the start, simply because of the nature of Drake’s name and his role in contemporary culture.
Drake is a very talented individual, but his difficulty in shedding his self-centeredness is often distracting. Nothing Was The Same, however, builds on ideas that tug at the core of the Drake dichotomy. The album hopes to change hip hop and music, and prove that the rapper is ready to step into the ring, fight and win — particularly in light of Kendrick Lamar’s verse on the Big Sean track “Control,” where Lamar essentially fired shots at the current state of hip hop and its lack of artistic credibility and going so far as to mention Drake by name. Whether or not the album actually has the muscle to propel Drake into the realm of more inventive emcees such as Kendrick Lamar and Earl Sweatshirt remains to be seen.

My first time taking a yoga class — Hot Vinyasa, to be exact — was everything I imagined it to be but also full of surprises. Let me explain.
Everyone who works at Earth’s Power Yoga seemed extremely welcoming and friendly, as I expected. After all, it’s their job to practice yoga all the time, so they must have a lot of inner peace stored up, right?
To my surprise, however, the other participants in the class were also very easygoing. Before walking into the space, I pictured a class full of bougie, plastic surgery-enhanced L.A. housewives. Instead, it was a diverse group of beginners, flexible dancers and yoga enthusiasts. I didn’t feel out of place at all, and I wasn’t even the only guy!
The studio was open and airy, and initially only slightly warm. I didn’t know what to wear to a yoga class so I just chose a black T-shirt and some running shorts, which was acceptable. The other guys were wearing bike shorts and tank tops, a smarter choice considering the yoga class was a hot one. And I mean that in the temperature sense of the word.
As our spiritual selves lifted upward through poses and meditation, so did the heat in the room. And, by extension, so did the sweat level. The class is not called Hot Yoga as a sexy marketing technique.
By the end of the first stretch sequence, my yoga mat might as well have been a Slip ‘N Slide. It’s actually pretty miraculous I didn’t fall over during the various balancing acts known as yoga poses. Tree pose, I’m looking at you.
Dangers aside, the class was a fulfilling experience. Vinyasa is a Sanskrit word that roughly translates as “to place in a special way.” It became the repeated mantra during our class, the reason for which I didn’t understand until later.
Vinyasa is a dynamic form yoga whose flowing style is meant to form a continuous series of movements, all connected by calm, measured breathing. As the instructor reminded our class, it is important to try to complete each pose transition slowly and in one breath. A union between breath and movement is the goal of each transition.
For me, maintaining composure was the most difficult aspect of yoga. In addition to my beginner’s confusion about the various moves that everyone else in the class already seemed to know, balance was my main battle. Most of the moves ended up being fairly simple to accomplish — the real art of yoga is making smooth, graceful transitions. You really have to listen to your body and let it guide your session. Unless you’re standing in a pool of sweat. In that case, proceed with caution.
A few of the moves that the instructor suggested were intended only for advanced or at least intermediate yoga practitioners, but being the semi-adventurous soul I am, I figured I’d give these a shot as well. Lesson learned: Peace of mind won’t overcome a distinct lack of arm strength, so someone with not-so-defined biceps should not attempt to do an arm balance position. Google that pose and you’ll know exactly what I mean. In the words of our instructor upon looking at my attempt, “Oh, that’s certainly creative. Stick to pigeon pose.”
One aspect of the class that I wasn’t expecting was a middle section that transitioned into a core workout. As much as I loved running high school cross country (at a very labored pace), the segment of practice that involved core training was the bane of my existence. Thus, when our instructor announced we’d be doing some core exercises, a fearful groan escaped my mouth.
Fortunately, and surprisingly, the core workout wasn’t that bad, probably because it didn’t last a very long time. Also possibly because I took some questionably earned breaks, but we’ll ignore that. For the most part, including a core-focused section in a yoga workout is dependent upon the specific instructor, so don’t let that be a deterrent in trying out a class.
Did I mention how warm the room became? Because this really can’t be stressed enough. At first, I was worried about sweating too much and looking gross, since I tend to worry about my appearance when in public, but halfway through I stopped caring. All of my anxiety must have escaped from my pores and evaporated, along with the rest of my body’s water supply.
Speaking of the human body under stress, yoga is not just standing on one foot and spreading your arms like a bird. Certain poses actually require some strenuous bodily contortion and, as a result, these poses might inspire some not-so-flattering bodily functions. Just ask the girl who was next to me in class.
The section I was most skeptical about, the meditation part, was actually one of the most enjoyable. During this time we were expected to keep our eyes closed and our minds open, silently sitting cross-legged. I felt silly for the first few seconds. The lotus pose felt so cliched, not to mention the music had switched from new-age noise to soaring flutes from a temple in the Himalayas.
After a quick one-eyed scan of the room, I realized I was the only one not “letting go,” so I did. I let go and just sat quietly. I ignored my thoughts as best as I could and, as per the instructor’s advice, tilted my head slightly backward as if an open space were floating in front of my neck.
Call it what you will — inner peace, nirvana, the zone — but meditation actually turned out to be fulfilling. I don’t know if my aura actually expanded or changed colors or anything, but I felt not only calmer, but also energized after yoga. Namaste.

Like a story straight out of a Hollywood film, up-and-coming pop singer Rozzi Crane found herself stumbling into stardom in a USC classroom. At only 22, Crane is the first musician to sign to Adam Levine’s label, 222 Records, and is currently finishing a tour with Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson.

The soulful starlet is already making waves in the music industry, but it wasn’t too long ago that Crane was a USC student herself. A run-in with Phantom Planet band member Jacques Brautbar in a popular music class during her sophomore year launched the young singer into the spotlight overnight.
Brautbar was a T.A. in Crane’s class who saw something special in the singer and asked her to collaborate on some music. The band’s manager then emailed a YouTube video featuring Crane to Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, who was equally impressed by the young singer’s abilities. Levine immediately emailed Crane saying, “Let’s start a label.”
But what sounds like a perfect Hollywood ending is only the very beginning for the young singer. Crane’s music has a distinct soulful sound inspired by hip-hop artists such as André 3000 and Lauryn Hill and divas such as Amy Winehouse. More recently, she teamed up with hip hop demigod Kendrick Lamar to produce a single for her debut album.
The sultry songstress, originally from San Francisco, said she has always had an interest in music.
“My mom always played music in the house,” Crane said. “I started attending music classes when I was three. I did a talent show in the third grade, and ever since then I was determined to become a singer.”
Crane acknowledges her hometown has had a significant impact on her style of music.
“There’s a certain authenticity in San Francisco,” Crane said. “I was always surrounded by quality musicians, especially soul musicians, and that definitely inspired my music.”
That authenticity is echoed in Crane’s songwriting. More than just a beautiful voice, Crane can also take credit for writing many of her tunes. She draws inspiration from “a little bit of everything” in her songwriting, but of course, relationships do play a major role.
“Heartbreak is the easiest [topic] because it’s so intense,” Crane said. “It’s easiest to find the words. I think that’s why so many musicians write about relationships because it’s the most frustrating, as well as the most wonderful, part of our lives.”
Crane’s beginnings include active involvement within the USC community, largely within the popular music department. She credits her current success to her time spent as a popular music student at USC. Which seems only logical, given that four members of Crane’s band are also USC alumni.
“USC was, and still is, such an integral part of my career,” Crane said. “The popular music major is completely unique, and I was so lucky to be a part of it. The talent coming out of the program is unreal, and the collaboration that’s coming out of the program is even more amazing.”
One collaborator from USC is band member Sam Wilkes, a longtime friend of Crane’s who arranges all of her music.
“[This is] the most important working relationship I have ever established,” Crane said.
Crane began her partnership with Wilkes during a popular music class at USC. Other USC alumni band members include Brandon Bay and Will Baldocchi, both popular music majors.
The close relationship with her fellow band members makes touring an important part of Crane’s journey as an artist. Crane says her current tour has been her favorite so far.
“I’m very close with the guys in Maroon 5, as well as the guys in my band being like my brothers,” Crane said. “So getting to work with all my best friends every set definitely makes this tour my favorite.”
Though the 22-year-old certainly already has much to boast about, she instead chooses to stay humble.
“I don’t know if I’ll ever feel like [I’ve made it]. There are definitely moments that feel good,” Crane said. “But mostly I’m thinking about all the things I haven’t done yet — all the things I want to do.”
Crane looks forward to releasing her own music in the future and having an impact on the lives of others with her unique voice.
“I haven’t gotten to release any music yet, so I’m most excited about getting to do that,” Crane said. “I’m also excited to continue touring to reach as many people as possible, and [to] continue to build that community of people who want to hear my music.”
When offering advice to aspiring musicians, Crane looks back at her journey and remembers what it took for her to achieve her goals as she continues to grow as a musician.
“Practice all the time,” Crane said. “Practice as much as you can, [and] say yes to every opportunity, within reason.”
Though Crane’s release date for her debut album remains undecided. Her tour will conclude on Oct. 6 at the Hollywood Bowl.

According to the Crimson White, the student newspaper of the University of Alabama, this year, at least four Panhellenic sororities blocked two black rushees from pledging  in order to keep their all-white composition.
For the University of Alabama, a school located in a state plagued by a history of racism and segregation, the deliberate blocking of black pledges is a disturbing indication that the mentality of sororities and its members has failed to change much over the years.
But the racist debacle holds greater implications for all Greek systems across the nation. Though the chapters of the University of Alabama are, of course, not reflective of all other university chapters of the sororities involved, the Alabama system’s deliberate blocking of black pledges sheds light on the ever-recurrent concern that  Alabama Greek life portrays itself as a strictly “all-American girl” image of Barbie blondes and brunettes.
It has been confirmed that alumnae of at least Alpha Gamma Delta, Tri Delta, Chi Omega and Pi Beta Phi have allegedly barred the girls from pledging the all-white sisterhoods, despite the fact these girls obtained high scores during the rushing process.
In examining the history of the Greek pledging process at the University of Alabama, it seems that the institution has had qualms about moving forward since its desegregation in 1963. The Crimson White reports that the first (and last) time any black person was inducted into a sorority through the formal rushing process was in 2003 when Carla Ferguson was offered a bid from Gamma Phi Beta, a predominantly white sorority.
Other than this one-time anomaly, the Greek system at Alabama continues to reflect the antiquated segregationist principles the school claims to have abandoned decades ago. The school’s Greek system is composed of traditionally black sororities and traditionally white sororities. Despite traditionally black organizations “[accepting] a diverse array of members over the years,” ultimately, traditionally black sororities are still dominated by black members and traditionally white sororities are still dominated by white members, according to the Crimson White.
Granted, though this may not be the goal of the majority of sorority chapters, this is certainly the negative stigma that continues to plague the national reputation of the Greek system as a whole. To current Greek members, a message is sent that their chapters must live up to the homogenous identity  that comes front and center, thus creating the notion that racism is acceptable within the Greek system.
According to the Associated Press, Judy Bonner, president of the University of Alabama, mandated that changes will be made within Panhellenic following the Crimson White exposé. Bonner ordered historically white sororities to implement a new recruitment process through which new members can be added during any time of the year, and that chapters expand their maximum size to 360 people in order to provide more of a chance to potential applicants.
And though Bonner’s efforts to admonish the current sorority system are a step in the right direction, these measures are nowhere near sufficient in attempting to strip the racist stigma from the system. All that Bonner’s actions have done is to send the message that there will be some consequences, but not actual ones. If positive change is truly to be made within the system, then more stringent punishments must be imposed; whether this means to suspend the chapter or impose some other authoritative sanction, consequences accorded to matters such as this must hold more weight in order to set an example both to the other chapters at the university and to sororities across the nation.
Even though the sorority chapters actively involved in discrimination at the University of Alabama are not representative of the nature of all sororities at other institutions, the fact still remains that the actions of this university’s sorority system reflect poorly upon the entire National Panhellenic Conference. The assertion that the majority of the Greek community does not stand for prejudice will remain an empty notion until some definitive action is taken to prove that their efforts aren’t simply a facade to protect their crumbling reputation.

I have to laugh whenever I hear such sanctimony and self-righteousness when one talks about racism. 
I can not keep up with the new and ever changing rules of racism today. What about fraternal organizations that are for Blacks or Asians? Are these organizations also despicable? I extend this sentiment to our political structures. Why do we in 2013 – still need a Black Caucus, Asian Caucus, etc.?
It is funny because whenever I walk along 28th Street on a Thursday night, the last thing I see is diversity. Not only skin color but also physical characteristics. I am sure it is not official criteria but I would bet these sororities rarely have  fat org Presidents – let alone pledges. Sorry to sound so crass about this but let’s face it – there is a quiet, unspoken rule that skin color hues have flexibility – but fat, unattractive people need not apply.
How interesting that only white sororities are being called out. .What about the “traditionally black” sororities?  Or the Asian sororities?  Why are THEY not considered discriminatory.  Oh right, I forgot. We can have a Black Entertainment Channel, but if we had a “White Entertainment Channel” it would be racist. And can you imagine what would happen if we had a “White History Month?”  Stop the double standards!
So glad we don’t have any bigots in our sorority system
I hope you meant that with tongue in cheek, because I wouldn’t take it seriously.

I wasn’t necessarily thrilled when I first downloaded iOS 7, the newest version of Apple’s operating system. I’m also the first, however, to admit that the changes are growing on me. Since the software’s introduction last week, I have heard far more complaints than praises about the system. But because this is the biggest change to iOS since its debut six years ago, I can’t say that I’m surprised; I recognize that the actual change is usually what causes customer dissatisfaction rather than any concrete problems with the software.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
 
Take Facebook, for example. When Facebook makes a change to website layout, it’s practically guaranteed that most people will be sent into an angry frenzy as they struggle to adapt to a new way of Facebook-ing. Let a few weeks pass, however, and allow people to adapt to the changes; their frustration will surely subside, and they will be forced to admit that actually, the new look really isn’t that bad.
In regards to iOS 7, I don’t anticipate this trend to be any different. I fully expect some people to reject the new look, only to eventually adapt to it and accept it as the new way of doing things. After all, iOS 7 is designed to to make it easier to access information and to be more aesthetically pleasing. What’s not to like? It’s just going to take a little getting used to.
The software has a flat, abstract look with bolder and brighter colors. It uses far fewer shadows and textures but continues to distinguish background and foreground elements with transparency effects. The typography is all-new, and many of the application icons look different; plus, a few of Apple’s apps have been redesigned. But all in all, the software will not require excessive relearning because the basic layout and functions haven’t changed much.
One of the newest and most useful features of the update is the added Control Center, which appears when users slide up from the bottom of the screen. It acts like a remote control for the phone. The center allows users to access their Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Portrait Orientation and Do Not Disturb mode settings along with the Calculator, Timer, Camera and Media Player controls, giving users a one-stop screen for many of their smartphone needs.
The Notification Center has also been redesigned to give people the reminders they need for their day-to-day lives more easily. The “Today” panel displays events, birthdays, the weather, stocks and reminders all relevant to today’s date. Again, the emphasis is on delivering information as quickly and simply as possible.
The updated software also includes AirDrop, a feature that allows iPhone 5 owners to use iCloud to share photos and files between computers and mobile devices more easily.
In addition, Siri is coming back better and faster than ever: Users can now modify the voice of their personal assistant and enjoy better results when searching for information. Siri will now search through data sources such as Bing, Twitter and Wikipedia when asked to find something, truly demonstrating how integral social media has become to the tasks of everyday life.
In the same way, the redesigns of the camera and photos apps serve as a reminder of how influential picture-sharing and Instagram have become. There is now a “square” frame option, so that users no longer have to take the extra step to crop a picture. Apple has also added picture filters and the ability for iPhone 5S users to take burst shots at 10 pictures per second and slow motion video capturing. Pictures are now organized by location and date, making it easier than ever to pinpoint moments and retrieve your favorite pictures from any time period.
There are also smaller additions that just make using an iPhone easier: Timestamps on messages in the messaging app are made visible by they sent and received messages by sliding the screen to the left. Users can also change the vibration patterns on their phones and block certain people from calling or messaging them.
Change is never easy, especially when iPhone users have become so accustomed to and dependent on their iPhones. Arguably, the software needed an update to be able to keep up with a changing environment. And let’s face it, six years is a long time to wear the same look. That makeover was sorely needed, and Apple certainly succeeded in creating an innovative design for their innovative devices.
iOS 7 feels cleaner and fresher. It feels like the future.

The new functionality is great. In my opinion – the color schemes are awful.  The bright green on the messaging is hard to read and I would love for my fonts to be darker – the gray is also a little hard to read.  I would like more choices in the coloring.
