USC’s American Red Cross Club is holding a blood drive from Tuesday until Thursday in partnership with the Trojan Scholars Society and the Inter-Health Council. The drive will be held from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m. in the Franklin Suite of the Tutor Campus Center.
It’s the first time that the three clubs have worked together on a blood drive.
“We believe it is important to work together as a student community of pre-health scholars to help out the public and our community,” said Sathvik Shastry, the Inter-Health Council president. “We encourage passionate students to help out and support their community.”
The United States is facing a major blood shortage and the USC Red Cross Club hopes that USC students will do their part to help out.
“A lot of people don’t realize that students make up a huge percentage of donated blood, and it may always seem like there is always a need for it, but that’s precisely because it’s true,” said Kevin Kong, the club’s biomedical chair. “Even fewer people don’t know that every two seconds another person needs a blood transfusion.”
Kong further highlighted just how consequential donating blood can be to potential patients.
“Each pint donated can save three patients’ lives, so there is no questioning our mission’s importance,” Kong said.
While there, students can also get their cheek swabbed and register for bone marrow donations. Rebecca Sauer, president of the Red Cross Club, explained that these donations can be used in treatment of a variety of different maladies.
“It’s cancer patients, it’s automobile accident survivors, it’s your little sister, your mom, your best friend,” Sauer said. “Blood donations are constantly required, and by bringing a blood drive to campus, we’re helping to ensure that patients can receive the blood they need, while making the entire process as easy for students as possible.”
According to the Miller-Keystone Blood Center, donations are in constant need because of the short shelf-life of blood. Donated blood lasts only 42 days, while platelets, which are in blood cells and are used to treat burns victims and cancer patients, last only five days.
The event is sponsored by Sprinkles Cupcakes and Yogurtland, and both companies have donated products for the donors.
The organizers are hoping to match — if not beat — their record of 143 donations over the three days, Kong said.
Though many book their appointments in advance, Kong is hoping for at least 20 walk-in donations a day.
The donation process takes roughly an hour, including the 15 minutes of observation after the blood is drawn.
Red Cross recommends drinking extra liquids following the donation, as well as avoiding strenuous exercise.
It takes only 24 hours for plasma to replenish itself after a donation, but it takes around six weeks for red blood cells to be replenished completely, which is why eight weeks are required in between donations.
“We are grateful for such willing volunteers that strive to help others,” Kong said. “The blood drives really encompass what it means to give back to the community as a Trojan.”

On Monday night, an open letter and petition addressed to USC President C. L. Max Nikias and Provost Michael Quick were created anonymously on Change.org and have circulated among students on social media.
The petition, which has received more than 400 signatures as of Tuesday evening, is calling for “an affordable education, transparency regarding where our tuition dollars are going, and student voting power in the Board of Trustees to keep our administration accountable.”
The petition directly cites efforts from the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government to lower tuition. Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry wrote a letter on March 10 to members of Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government regarding the tuition increase for the 2016-2017 academic year. The letter responds directly to requests in the governmental bodies’ resolutions regarding affordability and transparency.
“I’d like to thank the GSG and USG for reaching out to my team and me before, during and after the drafting of the resolutions about college affordability and financial transparency at USC. It is a complex topic, and I appreciate their diligence in investing their time to establish a solid base to inform that discussion,” Carry said in the letter.
In the letter, Carry points out that 17 years worth of university financial reports are available online but concedes that USC can do a better job of distilling some of the most important data points to help our students understand how their tuition dollars are being spent.
To that end, Carry said the University will use its About USC site to provide an easier-to-understand breakdown of the University’s finances to “more clearly describe how the University is working to maintain affordability, even as tuition costs are going up.”
In response to a request in the student government resolutions for 30 days advance notice of tuition increases, Carry said that the tuition rates for the following academic year are posted online in early March, providing an effective notice of five months.
According to Carry, the University will reinstate the Student Fee Advisory Committee, whose student members will be able to review proposed fee increases. This was directly requested in USG’s College Affordability Resolution and by GSG in a separate resolution.
“In direct response to the resolutions presented by the USG and GSG, I will commit the Division of Student Affairs to work with them on a memorandum of understanding to reinstate the Student Fee Advisory Committee,” Carry said. This MOU will articulate the purpose and roles for the committee and its members, including the review of proposed fee increases and the communication of any year-over-year increases in tuition and fees.”
A formal outline of the “purpose[s] and roles” for the new committee is in progress with input from USG, GSG and USC Student Affairs. USG had requested in November that a reinstated committee have the “express authority” to approve, reject or negotiate changes to student fees, but it’s not clear if that will be the case.
The main student request left unaddressed is a tuition freeze. Carry said that USC does not intend to formally freeze tuition.
“Year-over-year tuition increases at USC are at or near their lowest in 50 years,” Carry wrote. “As a non-profit institution that has to balance its budget every year, we must either raise tuition or cut services as our costs continue to increase.”
Carry also said that the demands for a tuition freeze directly conflict with students’ desires for on-campus programs.
“The student demand for additional services also increases every year,” Carry said. “We can’t fulfill both the request for services and for a tuition freeze. Those requests are at direct odds with each other.”
Carry wrote that the University will continue to work with student governments to consider the University’s finances and “the value of a USC education.”

Students, faculty and alumni discussed Native American history and its role in education in the Taper Hall of Humanities on Tuesday night. The event, entitled “Reclaim Your Narrative: Indigenous America post-1492,” was sponsored by the Academic Culture Assembly for EdMonth.
Taking place each March, EdMonth is a student-led series of events centered on a discussion of the current state of education in America. Its goal is to engage students in discussions about education as an important social and political issue. This year’s theme is titled “Reclaim-Recenter-Rebuild” with the aim of reestablishing standards, pinpointing systematic issues and remodeling the educational system with clear goals in mind.
The event began with a presentation from Ava Burnell, president of the Native American Student Union at USC. Burnell focused on the common themes across Native Americans’ educational history such as assimilation.
“By law, Native-American families were required to put their children into Christian boarding schools which stripped them of their culture,” Burnell said. “The schools prided themselves on the immersion into Western culture like the cutting of the hair and the removal of the traditional garb. When we hear about things like slavery and plantations, we think of the South being far removed from us. There were lots of tragic things happening to Native Americans and their education in California, right where we are.”
The conversation shifted to the state of Native-American education in the United States in the present day with a presentation from Timothy Vizthum, the teacher advisor of the Indian Education Program of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
“In school, the kids get the image of what Indian means through history classes,” Vizthum said. “Mentally say that’s not me, and that affects their identity because we limited the space that they can exist in. The feathers, dreamcatchers and drums are not the spaces most of our students live in.”
In addition to pushing for a curriculum that is relevant to American Indians and Alaskan Natives, representatives from the LAUSD Indian Education Program visit classrooms to present model lessons that are culturally relevant to give Native-Americans a space to identify.
“The Indian Education Program’s goal is to take the Indian out of the history books and show that there is a mosaic and community,” Vizthum said. “We want to show that no matter where you’re from you will be able to identify with others.”
The event concluded with a talk from Kieras Wilson, a full-blooded Native-American and former USC Admissions staff member. Wilson shared the importance of Native-American programming in colleges to garner a sense of connection among indigenous peoples on campuses across the United States.
“There weren’t higher educational programs back then like there were now,” Wilson said. “My schoolwork was really hard being a full-blood Indian. It was hard for people to understand and believe what I was saying in my papers. I couldn’t present evidence for my papers because there wasn’t any out there.”
Next week will conclude EdMonth for the 2015-2016 academic year. Future events and topics of discussion include the representation of queer history in high school textbooks, the role of sex-ed in public education and an immersive event at St. Mark’s Lutheran Church titled “Building Community Around Food: Cooking Justice with Groceryships.”

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, March 21, and Tuesday, March 22. 
Crimes against a person
At 12:42 p.m. on March 21, a student reported regular harassment by staff at Lorenzo Apartments.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 4:04 p.m. on March 21, a student riding a bicycle was struck by a vehicle near the intersection of Adams Boulevard and Portland Street. She was injured but did not seek medical treatment.
At 6:55 p.m. on March 21, a USC staff member driving a University-owned vehicle collided with a non-USC driver outside the USC area. The amount of damage was not specified.
At 12:52 a.m. on March 22, a coffee cup caught fire in a microwave oven at Parkside International Residential College. A student pulled a fire alarm, but the fire extinguished itself within the microwave and did not spread.
CORRECTION
The March 22 edition of the Daily Trojan contained an error. In the article “USC holds first human rights conference,” the Daily Trojan misquoted Mike Brand as saying that “The development on campus is a really great example of grad students and GAPA coming together to work on such important issues.” The students are working together on important issues and GAPA is an example of grassroots, top-level advocacy.
The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

The No. 3 beach volleyball team was back home playing at Merle Norman Stadium on Tuesday afternoon and came away with two solid victories over No. 6 Long Beach State and No. 19 Cal, recording a pair of 4-1 and 5-0 wins, respectively. Battling both fatigue and feisty competition, the Women of Troy dropped just three sets total on the day to win their seventh straight dual match in a row and improve their record to 11-2 overall.
Playing their first two matches after coming back from a tournament in Hawaii, the Women of Troy had to rely on each other in order to pull out the victories. Junior All-American Kelly Claes, who won both of her matches on the day with partner junior Sara Hughes, was ultimately pleased with how her team came together.
“I think we all played really well overall. We’re competing with each other in practice, and everyone is getting better each day, but more importantly, we’re getting better as a group and I think that showed today,” Claes said. “Everybody is coming out more passionate and more excited each match, and we’re playing more as a team, so it’s really exciting to see.”
Having been pushed to the brink against Long Beach State once already this season, the Women of Troy made sure to shut the door on the 49ers as soon as possible. The No. 5 pair of sophomore Jo Kremer and graduate transfer Zoe Nightingale and the No. 4 pair of sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante immediately put USC up 2-0 with a pair of 2-set victories over their 49er counterparts with a 21-6, 21-17 win on Court 5 and a 21-11, 21-19 win on Court 4 respectively. The match was quickly sealed over on Court 1 with Claes and Hughes dominating the 49er’s pair of Jenelle Hudson and Zoi Konstantopoulou, 21-9, 21-4. The No. 3 pair of juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler were pushed to a third set for the eighth time this year but came away with a 21-16, 19-21, 15-13 win, while the No. 2 duo of senior Alexa Strange and junior Sophie Bukovec ultimately fell in a close battle by a 21-16, 16-21, 16-14 score. Overall, the 4-1 win would mark the second time USC has defeated Long Beach State this season and evened up the all-time series between the two schools at 5-5.
It would be more of the same for USC later in the afternoon against Cal, as all five Women of Troy pairs put up two-set sweeps to claim the 5-0 victory. Kremer and Nightingale recorded a 21-6, 21-9 win over Cal’s Katie Regalia and Emily Shults on Court 5, while Belton and Bustamante dispatched Teya Neff and Rachel Wilson, 21-13, 21-14 at the No. 4 spot. Claes and Hughes would once again clinch the match over on Court 1 with a 21-6, 21-10 drubbing of Sarah Cole and Mia Merino. The defending AVCA national champion pair are now a perfect 16-0 on the season together and are riding a 41-match winning streak dating back to April 2, 2015.
Claes attributed the streak to “working hard and executing the game plan,” while Hughes added that focus was the key.
“I think we just really took care of our side of the net,” Hughes said. “Kelly and I were very technical, but at the same time we [just played] really fun volleyball. We knew where each other was on the court, and it was a really fun match.”
USC would also pick up a win on Court 2 with Bukovec and Strange notching a 21-11, 21-12 win over Bryce Bark and Kory Lamet, while the last point of the day would come from Martin and Wheeler, who defeated Grace Campbell and Olivia Rodberg, 21-14, 21-12, to complete the sweep.
Overall, USC improves to 11-2 on the season while Long Beach falls to 2-6 and Cal drops to 7-5. Now, the Women of Troy will get a much-needed break for nine days before they head out to Miami, Florida, to compete in the Florida International Surf and Turf Challenge on April 1 and 2. The first day of the competition will pit them against Tulane, South Carolina and Georgia State.

The women’s lacrosse team will face Dartmouth at McAlister Field at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.
The Women of Troy (7-0) have continued to impress after storming out of the gates to a 4-0 home record. The team hosted a tough Stony Brook team and notched a 14-10 win. Despite the fact that USC-Stony Brook may not exactly qualify as a rivalry game, there was a sense of retribution in this game.
The Seawolves (4-3) downed the Women of Troy in New York last season, 7-4. This time around, USC pulled away from the visitors as the first half wore on. The Women of Troy claimed an 11-5 score at the break and continued to dominate in the second half.
This somewhat fast start carried over to the team’s road trip to Berkeley and Moraga. The Women of Troy crushed Cal 15-2 before downing St. Mary’s 20-3.
At this point, the Women of Troy have proven their elite status not only at McAlister Field but also on the road. The ability to win — let alone destroy opponents — away from the cozy confines of home is one of the marks of a great team. While the season is still young, and there is plenty of lacrosse waiting to be played, the team’s early performances have shown just how poised this team is.
Junior attacker Michaela Michael is averaging four goals per game, tied for second-best in the NCAA along with Stony Brook’s Courtney Murphy. Murphy logged 5 goals against the Women of Troy but was unable to lead her team to victory, as USC’s defenders continued to play stifling defense.
This group’s high-powered offense has been a joy to watch, but the defense has been equally consistent. USC has the best scoring defense in the nation and is still the only team conceding fewer than 5 goals per contest.
In last year’s clash with Dartmouth in New Hampshire, the defense came up huge in a 9-7 win. Dartmouth standout Jaclyn Leto bagged 2 goals in that game, as the midfielder was kept relatively quiet by the USC defense. Leto is a potent scorer who scored 98 goals in her first three years in Hanover. Head coach Lindsey Munday will need to ensure her game plan includes how to slow the senior Leto, who is just behind Michael in the goals-per-game statistical category.
This Dartmouth team has already played a tough slate of games, including a road game against Florida. Dartmouth lost that game 16-6, but the Big Green’s 8-6 win over Denver last Sunday can certainly be considered a quality win.
USC lost to Stony Brook last season but responded with a win in 2016. It is safe to say that Dartmouth will have this kind of hunger to beat the Women of Troy after losing a close one at home a year ago.

Please don’t go. I know USC “expects to return all its starters,” but in this world of one-and-done and million dollar rookie contracts, who could blame a 19-year-old for jumping ship?
I am a wholehearted supporter of collegiate basketball players staying in school and not leaving early for the NBA. The NBA and the NCAA should be supporting this as well for many reasons.
The quality of basketball at both the collegiate and NBA level would improve — that is something that benefits both organizations as well as the players. 
In the world of college athletics where perennial powerhouses Duke and Kentucky are pumping out lottery picks in every draft, there is something endearing about watching a team like Virginia or Oklahoma who have fostered a superstar over the course of time and are now reaping the benefits.
The debate this year turns to LSU’s freshman Ben Simmons versus Oklahoma’s senior Buddy Hield, both near locks for the lottery. Perhaps Simmons has more potential to be a LeBron-esque superstar, but Hield is a senior and with three more years of experience, training and maturity, thus poses the safer pick for teams this summer. This debate is all without even knowing who will be injured when and not accounting for the development that each player will put in with their respective team throughout the offseason to improve, but the same debate happens at nearly every college once the season ends — should our guys stay or go?
The answer is almost always: They should stay.
There is the possibility for USC to build a sustainable success that goes beyond just one year with marginal postseason results and develop the talent and chemistry of this group to make more than one deep run into March — this doesn’t happen if players start leaving for the NBA.
Sure none of our players are lottery picks, but that doesn’t mean someone wouldn’t draft them in one of the later rounds. However, that prospect is especially inadvisable for the player. Why risk not making a team and floating around in the D-League for a few years when you can stay at USC in the glorious sunshine of Los Angeles, go to class four or five days a week and play basketball with a group of guys who you share the Trojan ties with?
The benefit that comes from staying in college and improving over the course of one or two more seasons can translate to millions of dollars and an elongated period of success for these prospects.
The team also benefits from the players sticking around longer. The intangibles that are developed over the course of time for a team are something that make Oklahoma more appealing to the eye than Kentucky. The team chemistry is there. The dedication is there. The connection to the players is there.
Last summer, the men’s basketball team traveled to Italy to play summer basketball. Not only is that a trip that those guys are going to remember for the rest of their lives, but the experiences both on and off the court that the team shares are what make a difference on the court in the long run. 
Baylor’s team imploded during their first round loss to Yale last weekend. Cameras showed teammates shoving each other and verbally fighting during a huddle. That does not translate to a winning culture on the court. 
Chemistry, friendship and camaraderie are what prevent these types of events from happening, and that can only happen when the whole team is all in over the course of their four-year stay at the University.
So please don’t leave for the NBA if you are considering it. Give USC a little more time. I know you don’t owe anyone here anything, but imagine what you and the rest of your teammates could build together with the Trojan Family rooting you on.
Another season is going to give you a whole new batch of stories and memories to share the rest of your life, not to mention the accolades that you and the team will be able to earn.
This season was great. It was a breakout year for USC, but let’s keep building on that. I’ll see you all at the Galen Center in November.

Trojan football’s annual Pro Day will take place Wednesday, where hopeful NFL prospects will be given the chance to demonstrate their athletic ability and positional skills for NFL scouts. Leading this year’s class of Trojans is junior hybrid linebacker and safety Su’a Cravens, who is considered the top prospect out of USC.
Known for his playmaking ability and tenacious ball pursuit, Cravens hopes to impress scouts mostly in athletic measurements such as the 40-yard dash, which he did not compete in at the NFL combine, the broad jump (114”), the vertical jump — (27”) and the bench press (16 reps). For the linebacker position, his measurements were in the top 10 at the NFL combine, and if he hopes to make the expected switch to strong safety in the NFL, Cravens will need to post better measurements.
Joining Cravens as a potential low-round draft pick is redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler who will also work out for the scouts, hoping to impress in positional drills. Known for his accuracy and low interception rate, he boasts the USC record for completion percentage at 67.49 percent. However, he has a penchant for an unexciting playing style, rarely airing out the ball and begins to struggle when forced out of the pocket.
Redshirt senior tailback Tre Madden looks to silence his critics who claim that he lacks pro-level explosiveness and playmaking ability. He hopes to post  physical measurements and explosive times in positional drills, as he did not complete any physical measurements in the NFL combine, save for bench press in which he was tied for fifth among running backs at 24 reps.
Senior center Max Tuerk hopes to post his first complete workout in some time, after suffering a season ending knee injury in October that decimated his otherwise solid first-round draft grade. Provided he posts solid numbers in his workout, he should be able to regain part of his lost stock.
Senior cornerback Kevin Seymour, redshirt senior fullback Soma Vainuku and redshirt senior defensive tackle Antwaun Woods round out this year’s participants at Pro Day.

LA Opera presented Giacomo Puccini’s Madama Butterfly in the first of a six-performance run on March 12. Last staged in its 2012-13 season, Madama Butterfly returns to Los Angeles with English stage director Lee Blakely’s tasteful adaptation of the operatic staple. Puerto-Rican soprano Ana María Martínez, fresh from the Metropolitan Opera’s own production of Butterfly, sang the titular character under the baton of Maestro James Conlon.
Madama Butterfly is one of the most performed operas in history. Initially panned by patrons at its 1904 premiere in Milan, the opera has grown into an audience favorite and remains widely popular. Given Butterfly’s esteem, one can almost guarantee astronomical ticket sales and a full house whenever it is performed — this is perhaps why Madama Butterfly is staged so frequently by major opera houses across the globe.
Despite the opera’s commercial success, the plot itself is plagued with themes of misogyny, colonialism and racism. The story centers on Cio-Cio San (otherwise known as Butterfly), a young Japanese geisha who is married off to American lieutenant B.F. Pinkerton. Though she instantly falls in love with Pinkerton, he leaves shortly after their marriage with a promise to return. Cio-Cio San waits earnestly for his return for three years, with her fervent love serving as her only optimism.
Regardless of the problematic tones present in the plot, the production was wonderfully executed. Blakeley’s adaptation, which debuted at Santa Fe Opera in 2010, is new to Los Angeles. What proved to be most exquisite about the production was the meticulous use of color used to convey the emotional intentions of the scene. Act I began with what seemed to be another classical staging, with a Japanese wedding celebration vibrantly adorned with flowers and traditional Japanese aesthetics. However, the palate of Acts II and III were monotonously grey, reflecting the melancholic condition of Butterfly’s situation.
At the podium, Maestro Conlon once again showcased his versatility as an artist, achieving an ardent verismic passion from the musicians. In the program notes, Conlon states, “Love and life, lived and lost together, are the elements of melodrama. This common theme is not his exclusive property. But in 12 operas … Puccini filters and distills it in a very personal way, almost exclusively through the agency of the maltreated woman.”
In the title role, Martínez was dramatically engaged from beginning to end. Though it seemed like she held back vocally in the first act, most likely due to the rigor of the role itself, she sang spectacularly from Act II onward. From a musician’s standpoint, it was refreshing to hear a singer who sings with such impeccable control and technique. Her aria within the final scene was the highlight of the evening.
Other standouts include mezzo-soprano Milena Kitic, who sang a luscious-toned Suzuki. As Pinkerton, Italian tenor Stefano Secco possesses a voice that bright and focused, though his upper register seemed strained at times. Kihun Yoon, a current Domingo-Colburn-Stein Young Artist at LA Opera, made a powerful Sharpless.
Madama Butterfly runs until April 3 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. More information regarding future performances can be found online.

A couple months ago, I got a text from my first-ever boyfriend that read, “I know we haven’t talked in a while but I feel like I owe you an apology.” It went on to say he knew it was too late for forgiveness, but he wanted me to know he didn’t feel right about the way we left things. I suppose it was fair given the fact that we officially, completely ended our year-and-a-half-long relationship when he texted me saying he didn’t love me anymore.
To be fair, this was several months after I had in fact broken up with him. It was what I needed, that concrete severance because I had been keeping obnoxiously in contact, spewing my continued love for him between vague allusions to my post-breakup rebounds. I was the one who was awful, though I didn’t fully understand how awful until someone who broke up with me tried to stay intimate afterward. He called me on my birthday, sent me eloquent emails, wanted to get lunch when he was in town. I agreed to go with that “I don’t love you anymore” text in mind, preferring to tell him to stop in person rather than over the phone. When he picked me up, he told me I looked beautiful and stared at me longingly like we were together. I was disgusted. Why would he end a relationship only to act exactly, maddeningly the same afterward?
It’s cruel, manipulative and utterly unattractive. I’m almost glad he was so irritating about it, if only to make it that much easier to get over him. But of course, I had done the same thing with the first boyfriend. At the time, I was working through my discomfort with having ended my first relationship, but in retrospect, it was completely irresponsible and selfish. I needed that love, and I forced it out of him, whether we were together or not.
It came as a surprise when he was the one to apologize. After all, we broke up almost three years ago. Though we talk intermittently and I keep in casual contact with his sister and mom, our communication has been pretty minimal. I was kind of worried to hear from him out of the blue like this — like he was in Alcoholics Anonymous or deeply depressed or something. A text was a tactless way to end things, but three years is a little long to still be regretting it. And besides, I needed it. He ripped off a band-aid I had been painfully peeling off millimeter by millimeter. I had come to terms with our ending, so why hadn’t he?
We had lunch over the break, the first boyfriend and I. Somehow, I think we had more fun then than we ever did when we were together. We’ve both grown so much, become more comfortable with ourselves and with other people. He was a much better conversationalist than I remember, I was less judgemental, and I can’t help but wonder if we could be better if we tried again.
Everyone I’ve asked has said absolutely not. My mom was irked I even went to lunch with him. My roommate told me I disappear before, after and during my relationships, that if it took me a year to get over him the first time, the second time around would be even worse. Hell, a random woman I met in a bar (a delightful Egyptian consultant) told me she wished she had someone telling her “no” before she made decisions like that.
And then there’s me, with everyone telling me he’s bad news, knowing
he’s bad news, and somehow I’m still attracted to the thought of him. There’s something so familiar about it, so comfortable. Even if it turns out as badly as it possibly could, it would be something I anticipated, something I might even be prepared for in advance.
I think that’s why it was so easy to get over the lingering one who broke up with me. I could see the end of our relationship coming a mile away. It was pretty much the same with the last guy I dated too — I could see the things that would separate us almost immediately. Yet I stay for a while, knowing the bad will only get worse but somehow comforted by knowing what the ending will be like. It’s the effortless pairings that seem precarious, when the partner is so great that the weakest link must be you.
Hell, no wonder I feel better single.

The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles premiered a screening of Black Radical Imagination on March 17. The film consists of six short films “emphasizing new stories from within the African Diaspora,” according to the project’s website. Free and open to the public, auditorium seats quickly filled while a good portion of the crowd watched from a small screen outside of the entrance. The immense turnout, consisting of a diverse population, speaks for the support this new wave of black cinema receives.
The short films were powerful messages about what it means to be black today. In the mainstream media, black citizens are greatly underrepresented. The presence of these citizens, constant throughout these films, invoked a sense of comfort — that black citizens could act freely, as opposed to being objectified to stereotypical roles, as is so common in the mainstream media.
As the films consisted of very abstract content, the end of the screening left the audience speechless and hungry for analysis. The two curators of the program, Erin Christovale and Amir George (who was also a participating artist), held a discussion. Two other artists, Terence Nance and Lauren Kelley, also joined the panel. Christovale questioned George, Nance and Kelley about their works and each gave complex answers.
George’s work, Just A Place, features the Hoodonians, of the planet Hoodoe, who were exiled from their home planet due to their appearance. Their faces are covered by the soft shells of their hoodies. As they lack spoken language, the Hoodonians are forced to communicated by movement. The common entity of the Hoodonians, as marked by their neon hoodies, and controlled movement, makes a statement concerning the black entity today. In Just A Place, the narrator states, “our hoods protect our souls. I was born in my hood,” so as to exemplify the confined boundaries black bodies are born into.
On the other hand, Lauren Kelley’s work, Burlap Interior, epitomizes dark humor through the use of black barbie dolls. This non-animated short features four Barbies, dressed in taffeta dresses and wax smiles, participating in a beauty pageant. After weeks of polish consultation and pleasure deprivation, no singular winner is crowned — everyone’s a winner. The film then follows the Barbies in their car rides home, capturing the mundane moments in their everyday lives. Kelley communicates what it means to be in a malleable state, as exemplified through the mundanity.
The last and longest film, Swimming in Your Skin Again, created by Terence Nance, featured black bodies clothed in neon yellow. This complex short takes place in multiple settings — at church, in the forest, at a pool — and channels relationships and love, as it is inundated by pop culture and religion. The abstract nature of this film is a result of Nance’s stream of conscious writing technique. Throughout the film, one person lays their hands on another, and each person who has been touched either disappears or is transported to another location. Nance’s idea here is that the act of touching someone calms them down, when what the person is fighting is unalterable.
“Without the ability to imagine a new future there would not be all this civil unrest,” Christovale remarked, as she passionately spoke about how black cinema needs to be constantly produced.
Surely, Black Radical Imagination took a stand against the paradigm of black people as portrayed in the cinema industry. This reimagination serves to create a new future, and this sold-out screening propels the movement in an undeniably positive direction.
Select works from Black Radical Imagination will be screened online until April 29. A schedule of future showings of the film can be found on the program’s website.

“Fiona ‘loves you … like a brother,’ ‘totally wants you … to meet the right girl someday,’ and ‘invites you over … to fix her computer.’”
The concept of the friendzone, and the internet memes created to sustain the phrase, have consistently gained and maintained attention on the internet, from Twitter to Tumblr, since it first became pervasive in 2012. Though the meme made its first appearance years ago in a Friends episode, the slang term has somehow managed to stay relevant, evolving with the trajectory of pop culture. Though the meme seems like a harmless and funny way to laugh at rejection, it has dangerous misogynistic implications that encourage men to believe in the false idea that they are entitled to romantic affection simply for being polite.
The friendzone is a term that describes a one-sided interest that is not returned, usually of men to women. Someone stuck in “the friendzone” considers being just friends with their crush an unjust and dreaded situation — making it much more than simply unrequited love. It’s not uncommon to hear the phrase casually tossed around conversations on campus like, “I’m in the friendzone right now and it’s hell. I mean, I bought her dinner and drinks and everything and she still didn’t let me come home with her.”
It is this type of male entitlement that led to individuals like Elliot Rodger, the teen who killed six and injured 14 before killing himself in Isla Vista, the college town of UC Santa Barbara in 2014, because he was furious for being rejected by girls that he found attractive. In his manifesto, “My Twisted World,” Rodger justifies his horrendous act of vengeance on his unhappy childhood, difficulties in obtaining a girlfriend and strong contempt for women. Resorting to violence after a woman refuses a man’s advances not only propagates a man’s sense of entitlement, but also adds to the fear of being hurt or murdered for not reciprocating affection.
More recently, in conjunction with the popular term “Netflix and chill,” memes like “When you’re so friendzoned that she actually wants to watch a movie when you say ‘Netflix and chill’” accompanied with a photo of a guy jumping off a cliff were created, further perpetuating the idea that men deserve attention and affection simply for being nice. The addition of an already misogynistic meme to another one adds fuel to the fire, making it apparent that the meme has the ability to cyclically assimilate to society. The inherent angst and feelings of self-proclaimed worthlessness that manifest when the reality doesn’t meet the expectations of romantic reciprocation are feelings that are universally felt by both men and women, but most exposure in media and culture that offers validation for that is gendered. “Netflix and chill,” which originated from Black Twitter to describe a code phrase for hooking-up, only subliminally validates and supports men to feel this sense of entitlement.
The idea of being friendzoned is commonly associated with nice guy syndrome, the concept that men “view kindness as currency that can be directly exchanged for sexual gratification,” according to Jezebel writer Erin Ryan. Both nice-guy syndrome and the friendzone suggest that if he does decide to treat a woman politely, then it is the woman’s obligation to return the favor.
Consequently, women grow up cautious about being too nice to men — if they’re too friendly it might be mistaken as interest, but if they’re not nice enough they may be seen as rude or cruel. If they communicate that they are disinterested, then they are exacting a so-called injustice by trapping their friend in the friendzone. Encouraging the friendzone only weakens the establishment of consent and diminishes respect that women deserve for saying “no.” It also implies that a friendship with a woman of interest is not valuable and is viewed as just a rung on the ladder to something more or a punishment for not getting something in return.
The friendzone may appear as innocuous slang on the surface but is a derogatory term deeply rooted in rape culture. It inflicts guilt on women for not returning feelings when they have every right to set boundaries. It encourages the false idea that men are robbed of something by being rejected and that they were owed something from a woman — when in reality, they were owed nothing at all. Instead of telling women not to friendzone men, men should recondition their mindsets and consciously take the time to unlearn what society has conditioned them to learn about entitlement.
You make many strong points with which I agree. When a person believes that the other party is obligated to reciprocate affection in return for an act of kindness, that is unjustified entitlement. When men treat women like prizes to feed their egos or rewards for their simple existence and the rejection to claim said bounty threatens male privilege or superiority, then the use of “friendzoning” as a word to describe the extremity if their injustice is disgusting. I also support your view on the necessity of acknowledging the female voice. Women are to be seen and heard and listened to in the face of major social problems, one being the still-existent and oppressive patriarchy. This is a conditioned mindset that needs to see change. 
However, I disagree with much of this very well-written article. I believe the “friendzone” holds much more meaning than just the small range you’ve described here, but your definition of “friendzone” is very much arguably as true, as is your opinion. It is a place where emotions are unreciprocated, yes; it is also a place where friendships that hold more than the superficial value you’ve described in your article hang in balance. The friendzone can be a place where cruel sacrifices are made and life-changing realizations occur– of course, with my definition of friendzone, and not yours. So, yes, the term can hold the mysogynistic weight you’ve described or the quick fix of cheap self-gratification that arrogant, entitled men can cash at a whim. The word can mean either, and it can mean both. In any case, the weight a word holds is only by the definition one gives it, which is much like the weight one would give the stereotype of an arrogant, entitled man who walks around and demands reciprocation for his mere existence. That is something we should all reconsider along with our own definitions.
Thank you for this article. It is a beautiful piece and I greatly enjoyed reading it.
Thank you for your comment.
Weeell, that’s why you don’t accept every “friend request” on Facebook. You tactfully decline when the guy says, “Hey, I ‘friended’ you. Didn’t you get my request?” Then you say, “Sorry, I’m real busy these days. I don’t even go on Facebook that much anymore.” He says, “Well, hey, how about we grab something to eat?” Then you say, “Not hungry….I gotta go.” (while you grimace)
The problem with our culture, is that everyone feels like they have to “be nice” to each other. Certainly, don’t be rude; be tactful and firm instead.
Did you even read the article? It doesn’t matter whether or not the woman politely declines or rudely declines — it’s the idea that even if she does, the male shouldn’t view it as something that is derogatory and shouldn’t view affection as something he is entitled to.
You have a “friend request” from Lil Gochu.
Accept or Decline? ;)
as a guy who’s read messages between guys and my female friends, i can say that some of our gender just can’t take no for an answer regardless of how the girl rejects them. It’s disgusting, ridiculous, and creepy

Editor’s Note: David Horowitz has disputed some of the assertions made in this column, which he believes are defamatory. In the interest of presenting all viewpoints, an agreement was reached with Mr. Horowitz where he was allowed to respond with equal space in a letter to the editor which printed in the March 28 edition of the Daily Trojan.
The College Republicans will be hosting David Horowitz on Wednesday for an event called “Stop the Jew Hatred: How Anti-Semitism is Perpetuated on College Campuses.” Dubbed the godfather of the modern anti-Muslim movement by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Horowitz is a conservative writer whose fundamentalist views degrade black Americans, immigrants and Arabs. Because incendiary rhetoric breeds intolerance against certain groups, it is irresponsible for a student organization to bring in a speaker who foments religious and ethnic hostilities.
Horowitz has a history of making unfounded and racist remarks. He has refuted the prevalence of institutionalized racism in the United States. He claims that “some blacks can’t seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others,” and in doing so, dismisses the systems that actively oppress black Americans. He has described the Black Lives Matter movement as “a racist hate group founded by a core of radicals.”
On Fox News’ Neil Cavuto Show, he said: “Muslim Student Associations were created by Hamas and funded by Saudi Arabia.” He also described Muslim students as “Wahhabi Islamicists [sic]” who “basically support our enemies.” His assertion is dangerously reductive and portrays all Muslims as extremists. His intent is to incite Islamophobia and to criminalize Muslim students. This type of us-versus-them mentality further divides people and reduces the complexities of Muslim identity.
In response to Israeli apartheid Week, Horowitz spoke to Brooklyn College using defamatory language to vilify and dehumanize Palestinians.
“No people have shown themselves as so morally sick as the Palestinians,” Horowitz said. “No other people has sunk so low as the Palestinians.” This is a man who openly and unabashedly slanders an entire population — on what merit can someone who is racist toward one group condemn the prejudice and hatred of another?
Horowitz’s hate-mongering against Muslims, African-Americans and Palestinians is unacceptable. People like Horowitz work to create spaces for the mass production of ignorance to promote their own political agendas.
While anti-Semitism is certainly an issue that deserves attention, bringing in a speaker like Horowitz creates an environment for inflammatory rhetoric rather than academic discourse. In fact, selecting a man whose bigotry and ignorance is well-known does a disservice to students who want to engage in a discussion about anti-Semitism. It is important to note that anti-Semitism — prejudice or hatred of Jews — is not the same as anti-Zionism, which opposes Israeli ethno-nationalism and the occupation of the Palestinian territories. I say this specifically because the description of the event is full of seditious language meant to divide the student body into two parties: (1) those who believe in, as the Facebook event asserts, “‘apartheid walls’ which disseminate mendacious Hamas propaganda” and bolster “lies about the Jewish state spread by Palestinian terrorists and their campus allies” and (2) everyone else. This type of rhetoric does little to facilitate an academic discussion but instead perpetuates an extreme interpretation of anti-Zionism. Conflating anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism is not only ignorant but also inaccurate.
There is very little respect for those who disagree with the Zionist cause. I find this ironic, coming from a campus organization that constantly recycles the same two arguments when faced with a difference of opinion — that the opposition to inflammatory rhetoric is an attack on freedom of speech and that students who enjoy left-wing privilege do not make room for intellectual diversity on campus. This said, why is an opinion different from traditional conservatism met with degradation? It seems as though the argument for intellectual diversity is only valid when it backs the conservative cause.
What the College Republicans need to understand is that criticizing Horowitz is not an attack on freedom of speech but rather on hate speech. According to the American Bar Association, hate speech is “speech that offends, threatens or insults groups, based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or other trait.”
Anti-Semitism has no place on our campus. Hatred against Jews is shameful and dangerous. Rhetoric or hate crimes steeped in anti-Jewish sentiment are never to be tolerated. All Jewish students should feel safe and protected at USC. In this regard, I contend that the same treatment is due to people of other faiths. Anti-Semitism is an important topic that needs to be addressed, but doing so does not give students a free pass to slander Muslims and belittle Palestinian students and their allies. All students are entitled to their opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict, and those same students deserve to be treated with respect regardless of their political and ethnic affiliations.

EDITORIAL: Destroy all churches
Obama silent while Saudi grand mufti targets Christianity
By THE WASHINGTON TIMES – The Washington Times – Friday, March 16, 2012
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
If the pope called for the destruction of all the mosques in Europe, the uproar would be cataclysmic. Pundits would lambaste the church, the White House would rush out a statement of deep concern, and rioters in the Middle East would kill each other in their grief. But when the most influential leader in the Muslim world issues a fatwa to destroy Christian churches, the silence is deafening.
On March 12, Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, declared that it is “necessary to destroy all the churches of the region.” The ruling came in response to a query from a Kuwaiti delegation over proposed legislation to prevent construction of churches in the emirate. The mufti based his decision on a story that on his deathbed, Muhammad declared, “There are not to be two religions in the [Arabian] Peninsula.” This passage has long been used to justify intolerance in the kingdom. Churches have always been banned in Saudi Arabia, and until recently Jews were not even allowed in the country. Those wishing to worship in the manner of their choosing must do so hidden away in private, and even then the morality police have been known to show up unexpectedly and halt proceedings
This is not a small-time radical imam trying to stir up his followers with fiery hate speech. This was a considered, deliberate and specific ruling from one of the most important leaders in the Muslim world. It does not just create a religious obligation for those over whom the mufti has direct authority; it is also a signal to others in the Muslim world that destroying churches is not only permitted but mandatory.
The Obama administration ignores these types of provocations at its peril. The White House has placed international outreach to Muslims at the center of its foreign policy in an effort to promote the image of the United States as an Islam-friendly nation. This cannot come at the expense of standing up for the human rights and religious liberties of minority groups in the Middle East. The region is a crucial crossroads. Islamist radicals are leading the rising political tide against the authoritarian, secularist old order. They are testing the waters in their relationship with the outside world, looking for signals of how far they can go in imposing their radical vision of a Shariah-based theocracy. Ignoring provocative statements like the mufti’s sends a signal to these groups that they can engage in the same sort of bigotry and anti-Christian violence with no consequences.
Mr. Obama’s outreach campaign to the Muslim world has failed to generate the good will that he expected. In part, this was because he felt it was better to pander to prejudice than to command respect. When members of the Islamic establishment call for the religious equivalent of ethnic cleansing, the leader of the free world must respond or risk legitimizing the oppression that follows. The United States should not bow to the extremist dictates of the grand mufti, no matter how desperate the White House is for him to like us.
The following are some recent examples of Hamas defining this ideology of genocide, as it applies to Jews:
1 – Quran condemns Jews to extermination
 “The Meccan [Quran] chapter entitled ‘Jews’ or ‘Children of Israel’ is remarkable… It’s about today’s Jews, those of our century, and speaks only of extermination and digging graves… This chapter sentences the Jews to extermination before a single Jew existed on earth… Palestine’s blessing is linked to destruction of the center of global corruption [Jews of Israel], the snake’s head. When the snake’s head of [global] corruption is cut off, here in Palestine, and when the octopus’s [Jew’s] tentacles are cut off around the world, the real blessing will come with the destruction of the Jews, here in Palestine, and it is one of the splendid real blessings in Palestine.” [Palestinian cleric , Al-Aqsa TV (Hamas), July 13, 2008]
2 – Jews to face yet another Holocaust
Headline: “Suffering by Fire is Jews’ destiny in this world and next” 
“… you will taste the punishment of Scorching Fire.” [Quran 3:181]
 “This [Quran] verse threatens the Jews with the punishment of Fire… the reason for the punishment of Fire is it is fitting retribution for what they have done… but the urgent question is, is it possible that they will have the punishment of Fire in this world, before the great punishment [of Fire in Hell] … many of the [Islamic] religious leaders believe that the [Jews’] punishment of Fire is in this world, before the next world… therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.” [Sheikh Yunus Al-Astal, Hamas MP, in his regular column in Al-Rissala, (Hamas weekly) March 13, 2008]
It is important to note that the Hamas MP switched words in the last sentence, from the word he used throughout, “harik,” which means “fire,” to “mahraka” a word from the same root, that is used by Arabic speakers to mean “holocaust.”
3 – Muhammad’s promise: Jews will be killed
“Regarding the Jews, our business with them is only through bombs and guns… the prophet [Muhammad] promised that we will fight you, with Allah’s help, until the tree and stone say: “Oh Muslim, servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.”
[Nizar Rayan, Hamas religious and military leader, Al-Aqsa TV (Hamas), Jan. 1, 2009. Note: Rayan was killed on Jan. 2, 2009]
4 – Extermination of Jews – good for humanity
In an article promoting the continued use of suicide terror in the official Hamas newspaper:
“We find more than one condemnation and denunciation of the resistance operations and bombings [suicide attacks], carried out by Hamas and the Palestinian resistance branches… [Eventually]  everyone will know that we did this only because our Lord commanded so: ‘I did it not of my own accord’ [Quran] and so that people will know that the extermination of Jews is good for the inhabitants of the worlds.”
[Al-Rissala, (Hamas weekly) April 23, 2007]
5 – Kill a Jew go to Heaven 
A poster that Hamas posted on its old web site taught that killing a Jew is enough to grant the rewards of Heaven.
Text on Hamas poster: “I will knock on Heaven’s doors with the skulls of Jews.”
Axe is crashing through the word: “Jews.”
[URL on poster, Hamas terror wing: “Ezz Din Al Kassam”]
6 – Resurrection dependent on Muslims killing Jews (1) 
Hamas goes even further in its religious packaging of genocide. Hamas teaches that the redemption of all of humanity, the anticipated Islamic “Hour” of Resurrection, will happen only when Muslims are killing Jews and the remaining Jews will be exposed by the trees and stones. 
Hamas writes in Article 7 of the Hamas Charter:  
“Hamas has been looking forward to implement Allah’s promise whatever time it might take. The prophet [Muhammad] said: ‘The time (of Resurrection) will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews; until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: 0 Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him!'”
[Sahih Muslim, Book 041, Number 6985]
7 – Resurrection dependent on Muslims killing Jews (2)
The Hamas belief that Jews must be killed for redemption to occur is a repeating theme of religious leaders on Palestinian Authority (Fatah) and Hamas TV. The following is one example:
“‘The Hour [Resurrection] will not take place until the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them, and the rock and the tree will say: ‘Oh, Muslim, servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, kill him!’ We must remind our Arab and Muslim nation, its leaders and people, its scholars and students, remind them that Palestine and the Al Aqsa mosque will not be liberated through summits nor by international resolutions, but it will be liberated through the rifle.”
[Hamas Spokesman, Dr. Ismail Radwan, PA TV, March 30, 2007] 
Conclusion:
Given this Hamas ideology of genocide, the essential problem with Hamas is not the missiles and rockets it showers on Israel, but the core belief that killing Jews is a prerequisite to redemption. Hamas’s ongoing attempts to kill Jews, which have led to the current Gaza War, are a symptom of the far deeper problem — the ideology teaching that Allah demands the extermination of Jews.
Israel and the West must create a strategy not only to destroy the terror infrastructures of Hamas, but to ultimately ensure that Jews and the world are safe from this ideology and its consequences.
Ms. Dianti, I hope you took the time to read Mr. Horowitz’s rebuttal to your essay, you might find it enlightening.
I wonder if Mz. Dianti plans to respond to Mr Horowitz and his response to this fact free column.
My guess is the cry of racism (How can one be racist against practitioners of a religion) will continue to bleat out, and the mischaracterizations will not be corrected.
Please prove me wrong Mz. Dianti.
So where exactly are all of these hate filled attacks on Muslims at the USC campus? I gues I missed the news on those lynchings. And since when does a differing point of view qualify as hate speech? In the author’s case it seems any opinions that criticize Islam or Muslims qualifies as hate speech. What a shallow defense for banning free speech! Ms. Dianti needs to read carefully the US Constituion with special attention to the First Amendment. As a reminder to Lida, you are not living in the KSA or Iran or any number of other, draconian, speech restricting, freedom restricting Muslim dominated countries, but you are residing in the US. If you cannot abide others’ rights to express themselves non-violently, then why subject yourself to this constant, daily torture?
This is a VERY silly post. USC is a private organization. It doesn’t HAVE to allow anyone to give a talk on campus. And the test for how terrible a speaker are isn’t whether there are lynching afterwards. Geez.
I still missed the news about verbal or physical attacks on Muslims at the USC campus. The author apparently sees raging Islamophobes behind every tree and bush. She also seems to think that anyone listening to Horowitz will turn into a Brownshirted thug looking to rough up the nearest hijab wearing Muslimah. Some of us call that victim mongering. Others might even label such thinking as paranoid. If USC doesn’t want any particular speaker on campus, as a private entity, it has the right. However, if it starts to show bias in who they invite, then the public has a right to call out this institution claiming to herald free discourse in thought and speech.
I am not surprised that you missed the news: from your tone, it doesn’t appear that you are terribly bothered about it anyway. There have been a string of racist incidents on or near USC’s campus in the last couple of years. Muslim students have also testified to feeling afraid on or near campus to openly speak Arabic, for example. Words certainly have consequences and USC has a duty of care to all of the students (many still teenagers) who are in their care. It’s certainly not “paranoid” when we have direct testimony from students to that end. If someone wanted to come on campus and call all women “sluts”, “whores” and “deserving of rape”, I would think that there might be real-world consequences too. It’s one of the reasons why I find Tucker Max so repugnant, for example.
Thank you for acknowledging USC’s right to determine who comes on its campus. It’s a private institution, with its own values, and should not be forced to be just like everywhere else because of political correctness about political correctness.
I also hope that USC DOES show bias as to whom it invites. I want a bias towards people with insight, learning, thoughtfulness, civility, and elan. I want GOOD speakers. And I don’t want BAD one. If that means a Marxist, a Muslim, an atheist, a conservative, or a Dadaist, I don’t particularly care. Free enquiry is a good thing, after all.
What we don’t want is knucklehead undergrads inviting deliberately idiotic speakers who are deliberately offensive to minority groups on campus so that the wingnut online hordes can martyr the kid for his ten minutes of fame. Shows a distinct lack of character and he forgoes the opportunity to invite actually interesting conservative speakers to campus.
LMAO! Muslim students being afraid does not constitute a proven case of harassment or assault. Check a law book you moron.
There should be a comma before “you moron”. How is that glass house you’re in? And, no, Muslim students being afraid does not constitute that, but that isn’t the standard which USC seeks to live up to. It’s a random standard you have plucked out from nowhere. Real people have been affected by racial, sexist, and other forms of abuse on campus. You trying to be an internet tough guy doesn’t make that go away.
Aww. Please call the campus police, if I hurt your tender feelings there snowflake. The law is not a random standard, even at USC (they do have a law school there – I suggest you Visi it). You can’t live forever in your protected ivory tower, where feelings seemingly trump knowledge and ability these days. 
You missed another comma before “snowflake”. Did you graduate High School? And, yes, the law is a random standard to use in this context as USC can take whichever one it wants: for example, it is not illegal to cheat on a test, it is, however, often enough to get you kicked out of USC. And, yes, we do have a law school: one which, I dare say, you’d never have got the grades for. As such, I don’t think you should be talking about “knowledge and ability” as you’ve demonstrated little of either here as you’ve been spanked on basic logic. Enjoy your ideological cotton wool box rather than thinking through issues from first principle and using actual data.
The law is not random at USC. The legal codes of federal, state and local jurisdictions apply to that school, as they would at any university. USC is not a diplomatic mission, but a university in Los Angeles, CA. USC may have additional codes of conduct on top of these laws, but they do not cancel or supersede other jurisdictional laws in any way. Only in your bizarro fantasy world are laws of the land deemed ‘random.’ Anyway snowflake, isn’t it time for you to attend your Safe Space 101 class, where you can view images of puppies at play and hug your favorite plush toy? How do they grade those courses anyway?
What a bizarre comment. The law is a random STANDARD for you to apply to what we were talking about. No wonder you didn’t go to college, your reading comprehension is all over the place. And you seem to have a strange understanding of what university is like and what kinds of things they teach. Again, you still need to learn basic grammar: employers judge you for it and if you want to be a productive member of society, it would be better if you aimed to get one. I award your comments here a D-. Not ready for college.
I’m betting that I’ve spent more time at university, than you’ve had wearing your undies. You got a bit word salady at the end there, fella, so don’t be so quick to lecture about proper writing skills. In any event, you petulant infant,  the real world won’t be a safe space, when you’re time at university is completed. And you can take that last one to the bank.
I am sure you wander around university campuses but that no more makes you smart than an attendee at Wrestlemania is an athlete. I’ve spent plenty of time “in the real world” where I knew that not knowing the difference between “you’re” and “your” was important for continued employment. And my PhD says that your presumption is as comic as it is wrongheaded. You’ve really made yourself look foolish on this page. Not to worry, no real-world connotations other than feeling like a bit of a fool. But why not draw a life lesson from all this? I suggest the following: (1) learn to think for yourself and not use cognitive heuristics of seeing who the nuttiest person in a debate is, and agreeing with them; (2) learn the great Christian virtues of humility and love for the stranger. There’s too much hate in this world: be part of the solution, not the problem.
Haha! PhD. Yeah, I have one of those in the sciences. And another doctorate with a clinical focus, which means I actually produce things and help others directly, rather than fool people into thinking that they are falsely traumatized by such as idiocy as seeing, ‘TRUMP 2016’, chalked on a sidewalk.  
Don’t get me wrong, though, because universities need the other, soft headed majors for the jocks and other under qualified students posing as aspiring academicians, so they can get passing grades. And we see that abundantly in most schools with top flight athletic programs which pass along these kids, many of whom are functionally illiterate. There was a time, however, when the liberal arts stood for more than the ridiculous social justice tripe they’ve devolved to these days. There used to be rigor and value to these disciplines. And now? They’ve been diluted to near uselessness. What to do with a Gender Studies degree anyway?  Why, stay at university to brainwash the kids into thinking that gender is a purely fictional construct without any use in human society!
And I never need to worry about humility as a virtue. You surely have little, otherwise you wouldn’t be responding to my posts. The humble man pays no heed to the fool, yet you’ve proved incapable of that. And spare me the Christian lectures too. I have no time for a religion that has decided to focus on pathological altruism and suffering for its own sake, rather than edifying people and lifting them out of their own self-imposed mental prisons.  Plus, you’ve acted like a complete boor towards me – where is the love, brother?
What a very odd post. It does make sense that you are in the sciences, though. Firstly, I guessed from your poor grammar and lack of knowledge of what the social sciences and liberal arts teach (e.g. gender is not the same thing as sex). Secondly, it explains the rather torpid, black-and-white way you seem to see the world. Lots of totalitarians come from a scientific background because they think that the tools of natural science should be applicable to the social world or used to explain things beyond the realm of what the scientific method was designed to explain (the Dawkinsesque, ill-considered barb at religion further buttresses this line of thinking). It’s no surprise that that many Islamic terrorists studied engineering, for example. And many of the inverted-Marxist far-right have a similarly Manichean view of the world. Shows how the liberal arts are needed now more than ever, lest the self-assured philistines inherit the earth. As for my humility, no straight thing may have been made from the crooked timber of mankind, but I shouldn’t give up on your ability to think for yourself or learn some empathy just yet. You might be damaged but, I hope, not beyond eventual repair.
Horowitz should have been stopped from speaking so that he could not spread his harmful ideas. His words are too dangerous for the students’ fragile minds. Enlightened people like us need to decide what students will hear to make sure that they hold the right beliefs. When people have the Freedom to choose, they choose wrong.
What a weird comment. There’s all kinds of hateful bilge on the internet. But people are perfectly within their rights not to want it in their community.
I read this and found that I agreed with pretty much everything Horowitz said and can’t even see why he’s controversial. He’s just speaking the plain truth.
This is obviously silly. Horowitz should make his way over to the medical campus for proving a biological miracle in managing to be the first person who can speak from an orifice that isn’t his mouth.
What did he say that’s not true?
Well, for a start, he runs a webpage which tries to chill professors in terms of choosing material from which they choose to teach. The irony that Horowitz is being held up as a paragon of free speech on campus is just sick.
Liberal fascists don’t seem to have a problem inviting Muslims who advocate jihad and Sharia.
Can you suggest who fits this description at USC?
Apparently, the writer attacking Horowitz.
I can tell you that the writer does not fit that description. Shame on you. Shouting insults is not debate.
Monsters like roccolore have no shame.
Muslim fascists like you have no shame.
Does your nurse know you are on here?
Thank you for writing this. Your view is much appreciated and you are not alone. Horowitz is sick, he sounds like Trump. Good riddance!
Fascist Democrats like you are the sickos. You are anti-Jewish and pro-jihadist.
Nope, you’re wrong. Good luck!
Liberals are not outraged over what ISIS and Hamas do, but by what Horowitz and Trump say.
I am outraged by stupidity like this
Liberal fascists like you are the stupid ones.
If you don’t realize that “liberal fascists” is an oxymoron, then I think you might be stupidity par excellence.
Not really. The liberals attacking Horowitz will frequently invite anti-Jewish speakers.
Like who, in USC’s case?
Horowitz is an evil monster, he does not belong on campuses.
Muslim fascists like you have no morals.
Author H.G. Wells who was a progressive coined the phrase liberal fascism when he gave a speech to The Young Liberals of Oxford in the 1930’s.  Progressives were quite enamored of the abilities of fascists to ignore the constitution of Italy in order to obtain social justice for workers.
How odd: firstly, the Liberal Party were not appeasers and aggressively opposed both Mussolini and Hitler so both H.G.Wells and the Young Liberals would have had no time for skirting around the Italian constitution. Indeed, it was the Liberal Party- and now the Liberal Democrats- who want a written constitution because they think too much power is held by the executive. So who were these progressives? Certainly not liberals. But even if H.G.Wells found one or two confused young people, the term doesn’t improve with age. Just as the term “short giant” and “stupid genius” have not caught on, I suppose. And when you contemplate actually existing fascist regimes of the 20th century- Germany, Italy, Chile, South Africa, the Junta in Argentina etc- it tended to be the authoritarian Right who were their biggest apologists/supporters.
Anyway, the point of not wanting hateful ignoramuses on campus is hardly fascist, it’s just common sense. Just as USC can’t let in undergrads who don’t meet their academic standards, there should be similar quality control for guest speakers.
Immoral Ziofascist like you are ignorant.
Muslim fascists like you are ignorant. You kill over cartoons.
Enlightened people like us need to decide what students will hear to
make sure that they hold the right beliefs. When people have the Freedom
 to choose, they choose wrong.
LOL. Your response is probably either over their heads or just won’t persuade the Regressives.
“It is terribly easy to romanticize. Human beings do it all the time. But romanticizing can get out of hand. Think of all those millions of German women who swooned as Hitler drove past; the groupies of Stalin, the steadfast admirers of Osama bin Laden, or the women who offer to marry murderers on death row. Charisma, as Max Weber told us, is not so much an innate characteristic of a leader or guru as something brought to him by others. [1]
Hitler was not a good-looking man, not tall, not prepossessing, not particularly intelligent, not a great orator — more a strident tub-thumper — yet millions of Germans loved him and died for him. In the end, Germany itself all but died for him.
Today, the romanticizing of sociopaths has not ended. However much we know about the clay-footed idols of the past, or the enormities committed by those demagogues and rabble-rousers and charlatans, many of us just transfer our allegiance to the next monster-in-waiting.
Those in Europe and the United States who romanticized Communism and the Soviet Union in Europe have gone through such transitions more than once since the days of the 19th-century anarchists and Marxists. Often they have woken up, only to fall asleep again. They have idolized Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Castro, Che Guevera, and Ho Chi Minh. Some, such as the former German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, have moved in a less delusional direction. Disavowing violent activism, he wound up as a Green party parliamentarian who supported NATO and intervention in Bosnia. Others still just stumble on from hero to hero, cause to cause, embracing whatever seems most anti-democratic, “anti-establishment” or most comfortable among their friends.[2]
In recent years, however, these graying adolescents of the European and America “Left” have moved in a direction that could not have been predicted even in their own darkest nightmares. They have allied themselves with the most fascistic, reactionary and anti-liberal forces on the planet. Today they march arm in arm, not as fellow-travellers with the Vietcong or the Fidelistas, but step by step alongside anti-Semitic Islamists: pro-jihad extremists who threaten death and destruction on all of Western society, including the very people now defending them. The gay solidarity groups back the speech of radical Muslim clerics who, in the Middle East, would kill any stray homosexual crossing their path. There go the sisterhoods, arm in friendly arm with men who despise women and would put all of them back into niqabs, burqas and house-seclusion at the first opportunity. There go the fresh-faced young women-converts to Islam, on a desperate hunt for husbands to dominate and possibly beat them while dreaming of children to train as future martyrs. And there march Neturei Karta and other Jewish extremists and leftists, hand in hand with their future killers.
The Communists in Germany often gave their lives to prevent the Nazis from destroying their country. Many died in concentration camps. Brave idealists from many countries fought in the Spanish Civil War to prevent the fascist forces of Franco from taking over. But their heirs today march through the streets of European cities chanting “We are all Hamas now!” and worse, the genocidal, “Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas.”
The anti-fascist Marxist sympathizers have never quite died out, but other, sinister, things have happened, beginning with the extraordinary eruption of outrage that convulsed parts of Europe and the United States in 1968 and 1969. These same Romantics, appalled by the steady decline of the Soviet Union and the successes of the liberal democracies, turned on the societies that had fed and clothed them. The anti-Vietnam war protestors, for all their purported moral concern, simply joined forces with the enemy. It was no longer a case of “war is bad” — not unreasonable to say in the abstract — but, “we want the Vietcong to win and to defeat America.”
In the same period, support for third-world countries (especially Communist regimes) burgeoned. Western intellectuals, students, madcap suckers for victimhood, hippies, “anti-establishment” rioters and many more suddenly found themselves enamoured of the cult of death peddled by Che Guevara, Chairman Mao and the PLO. It did not matter that these were all mass murderers or terrorists, so long as they fought the brave fight against “Western imperialism,” now declared the greatest evil in the world.[3]
The 1968 rebellions slowly died away, but their hardline sympathizers remained. Many, such as the Weather Underground in the U.S., the Red Brigades in Italy, the Direct Action group in France, and the Red Army Faction/Baader-Meinhof Gang in Germany turned to violence, yet were beloved of many who saw them as fearless fighters against Western governments and institutions. Their cold-blooded assassinations and bombings sent a frisson of admiration among those wished that permanent rebellion might actually be a meaningful goal in life…”
Mamet, in 2008, wrote an article for the “Village Voice” called “Why I Am No Longer a Brain-Dead Liberal.” He described his conversion from the typical Noth-like Hollywood mindset:
“As a child of the ’60s, I accepted as an article of faith that government is corrupt, that business is exploitative and that people are generally good at heart. These cherished precepts had, over the years, become ingrained as increasingly impracticable prejudices. Why do I say impracticable? Because although I still held these beliefs, I no longer applied them in my life. … I began reading not only the economics of Thomas Sowell (our greatest contemporary philosopher) but Milton Friedman, Paul Johnson and Shelby Steele, and a host of conservative writers, and found that I agreed with them: A free-market understanding of the world meshes mor
“What the College Republicans need to understand is that criticizing Horowitz is not an attack on freedom of speech but rather on hate speech”
Yet more “hate speech isn’t free speech” blather.  Free speech and so-called “hate speech” are the same thing.  The First Amendment protects what the “genius” who wrote above “editorial” is calling “hate speech”  Even more ridiculous is the notion that any criticism of the black lives matter movement is racist.
No one is saying that the moron should be prosecuted, just that he should not be given the time of day
Nonsense.  Individuals are trying to bar him from campus on the grounds that he “doesn’t have a right to hate speech”.
He doesn’t have a right to come on a private campus and spew hatred, no. After 9pm he’d need a valid USC I.D. too. It isn’t very hard to understand: would you feel like you were required to invite a guest to your house who plainly intended to pee on your furniture?
USC is a publicly funded university. Also, the man is not spreading hatred. They’re trying to ban him because he tells the truth and they can’t beat him in a debate.
(1) There is no debate; (2) the fact that he thinks what he says is “the truth” is dangerous in itself; he has opinions- bad and unlettered ones; (3) Yes, it receives some public funding. So what? If you are saying that any private organization which takes some public funding should not be allowed to follow its own rules, then you are a dangerous, anti-free speech fascist. Next you’ll be forcing private churches to marry people they don’t agree with.
Why most Ellenhorn invited these tedious blowhards to campus? Can’t he invite someone smart and interesting instead?
You would invite Imam Haji Osama Muhammad from the terror mosque, where he would advocate killing Jews.
I have never heard of the guy, so I think this is a  product of your fevered imagination 
And since you’ve never heard of him, the only possible explanation is that he doesn’t exist.
It rather DOES suggest that I would not “invite” him to campus, though.
Ziofascists never cease in fabricating myths to suit their evil goals.
You Muslims are the fascist liars who bomb subways and airports.
Controlling, let alone prosecuting, free speech makes you a fascist.  If the speaker’s content isn’t to your liking, then don’t attend.  Grow up!
As Horowtiz is wont to say, “Scratch a liberal enough and you’ll find a totalitarian” like Lida.
Goes to show how the man isn’t smart enough to have been invited
Silly post. One can happily object to speakers. It’s called free speech!
Liberals want to shut down critics period.
Are you actually this stupid or are you being ironic?
He is gatactically stupid.
Muslim fascists like you are stupid. You kill over cartoons.
Thank you for your thoughtful, well-written piece. An anti-Muslim speaker should have no place on a university campus — just as an anti-Jew, anti-Mexican, or any other bigoted speaker should not be welcome. There is a difference between being tolerant of differing political views and racism. There should be no place for racism at USC.
How does one defeat an enemy that one knows nothing about? If you want to combat racism, you bring racist speakers to campus, listen to the foundations of their beliefs, then you challenge them.
Fascist Democrat, what race is Islam?
roccolore, may you be well. May you be happy. May you be free from suffering.
You didn’t answer his question: what Race is Islam?
Considering the questioner called her a “fascist”, I don’t find it surprising. Why do all these far-right hatemongers shout insults at people and then expect people to politely reply to their nonsense?
It’s left-wingers who are the hatemongers. They hate Jews, hate Christians, hate freedom, hate dissent.
That’s silly. Jews tend to be left-wing, I am a Christian, I very much enjoy freedom, and I read ‘Dissent”. I think it’s time you jettisoned your worldview and were humbled by our complicated the world is and how little we understand it. Then you wouldn’t simply presume that the far reaches of the paranoid blogosphere has all the answers.
silly Marxist talk .. catchwords and no evidence .. what bubble is she in ?
LOL, protect me from scary ideas!
There are plenty of scary, stupid ideas. I think students want rather better ideas.
You’re just like those snowflakes at Emory, whining over chalk writing.
Not really. Has the nurse missed your meds round?
I guess you never read about the Emory cowards upset over chalk writings of “Trump 2016.”
Which is nothing like this. Do you often draw trends from one small datapoint?
Well, given that he was invited to campus, it would seem students do want to hear his ideas.  Just not the students you agree with.  But opinions you don’t like dont’t count, do they?
I am not sure that they “don’t count” but I have a right to call them out for being incredibly stupid. Unless you’re against free speech now?
That’s a lie. You are fully aware of the fact that the people who support Horowitz are not trying to silence his opponents from speaking and that it is the people who are anti-Horowitz who are trying to ban him and any other ideas they don’t like.
THAT is a lie. Every day people speak on campus who disagree with each other and most people on campus. No one is trying to silence debate or different viewpoints. They just don’t want morons to be invited onto campus who peddle a line in hate speech. After all, I don’t just let anyone wander into my house. I tend to ask only people who I feel like will be respectful and useful. The same rules for Horowitz goes for everyone else: if he can learn not to be a boorish rabble-rouser and have something interesting to say, he’d be welcome on campus with open arms, just like other conservative speakers who I have had the privilege of going to see.
The Left preaches being open minded to people that are further to the Left and being intolerant to people who believe in such things as limited government.  Perhaps I’m wrong about USC.  Can you name a conservative in the last couple years been able to speak without body guards and not having leftists trying to stop the speech?
Yes, pretty much all of them! It’s USC, for heaven’s sake, not Berkeley. The campus is very tolerant to different ideas. Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, is the commencement speaker. Hardly the Ayatollah Khomeini.

Dear President Nikias,
Spring break is over and yet many of my fellow Trojans come back restless, not because of the fun they had traveling but because of the looming bills and payments that await them.
While students should be able to focus and hone in on getting good grades and enjoying their college experience, many face the pressing issue of college affordability.
Two weeks ago, students rallied against an $1,978 increase that would put tuition at $51,442, higher than Stanford, Yale and Harvard.  The demonstration drew national media representation, yet you refused to meet with any of the courageous students who shared their stories with the public. Your administration even turned a prospective student away from attending the University after he witnessed the rally and made a point to voice his concern to officials.
I urge you to reconsider and meet with the students who have expressed their financial hardships. We need to know where our money is going as any good ratepayer should. And most importantly, I want you to explain your side of the story as to why such obscure procedures continue at a leading academic institution.
I cannot help but continue to shed light on a serious problem that has affected thousands of students and me. The rising cost of education at USC forced me to consider transferring out of the University last year when I was a sophomore.
I spent hours writing college essays in addition to my actual college essays and found myself stressing over every grade. Without doubt, it was one of the worst points in my life. Knowing that the amount of time and effort I put getting into this school in the first place could be washed away was hard to even comprehend. It felt like it was senior year of high school all over again, except much more expensive.
The USC Financial Aid Office, instead of congratulating my parents for making smart financial decisions to better prepare them for a sustainable retirement, slapped them on the wrist. To maintain the grants I received my freshman year, my family would have to forgo the future guarantees of financial security that they had tirelessly worked for. Having parents who went through the worst in the real estate and health insurance industries during the recession, it made no sense for me to put them at any more of a risk. The investment they were already making in my education — and soon to be my sister’s — was more than I could ever ask for.
It was by the grace of the Town & Gown of USC that I was able to stay and finish my college career as a Trojan. Because of the stress this situation put on my family, my sister chose not to even apply to USC. I know other families that have made the same decision.
USC cannot continue to tout all of the positives it’s doing in relation to financial aid (Pell grants, endowment, etc.) by diverging from the truth. I commend Undergraduate Student Government and other students for working hard to get this very truth from you and the administration, and I will continue to back such efforts. I will always step up to the plate and defend USC’s advancements, but your administration’s failure to communicate with students makes it harder for me to do so.
What am supposed to say when a family comes up to me during an admitted student reception and says, “How is financial aid at USC? Is it guaranteed?” or “Do you know where the money goes?” A family can make $150,000 a year and get nothing in financial aid; yet, that’s almost what it takes to pay for one year of schooling when taxes and other expenditures are put into play. It just does not make sense.
Even partial scholarships have less of an impact on students every year. A $15,000-a-year award will barely cover tuition hikes by the time a student graduates. And yet we are meant to make a big deal about it. Somehow now that student can afford college. Somehow, now that student can truly be a proud Trojan.
Thousands of students are in worse financial predicaments than mine. I’m writing this in terms of principle and that no one should have to convince their family to lessen their future financial security, especially after a recession, to attend the college of their dreams.
Let me say that I am not one to talk poorly about USC — I work for the Alumni Association and can tell you countless positives to being and becoming a part of the Trojan Family. I have had an incredibly wholesome experience thus far attending the University, in part because of several changes that USG and the administration made since President Sample’s tenure, such as an increase in academic rigor and global awareness. And I have had opportunities to make some of these changes in our community and beyond through leadership and philanthropy.
As a journalist, I am trained to see every side of an argument and eager to hear your response to all of us students concerned with the rising cost of tuition. You owe a meeting to everyone who rallied, allowing each student an opportunity to share their story in person.
I know in my heart that you care about us students, President Nikias. If you value transparency and leading the charge on reforming education economics, you must act now. Put your constituents first and meet with us and explain your side of the story. That’s all I ask.

Here are some fact-checks to understand some of the context of this national conversation:
– While the $50K price tag is shocking, this is actually an increase rate lower than in past years at USC.  It was previously 6-6.5% per year and has been curtailed to about 4% per year more recently.  A call for 10% budget cuts across all departments and schools was initiated in 2014.  Comparably, Harvard and Stanford tend to increase their tuition at a rate of 3.5% each year, and Yale is also at a 4% annual increase. This used to be in line with inflation rates, but not anymore.  Inflation has mostly been below 2% since 2009, when, uh, something happened in the world economy…
That said, having a percent increase in tuition is obviously unsustainable as 4% of $1000 is very different from 4% of $1700.  The media seems to be making a big deal about $50K, but lots of universities aren’t far behind (in the high 40s) and I would venture to say these other high tuition private universities will soon join the 50K Club.  Clearly no points for being “first” on this one.
– Entering the ranks of top national universities, USC is now thrown in the same conversation with top-10 schools such as Yale, Stanford, and Harvard.  However, USC has an undergraduate enrollment the size of Yale, Stanford, and Harvard COMBINED (19,000 undergrads vs. 5,000, 7,000, and 6,500 respectively).  The truth is that there are very few *private* universities as large as USC; only NYU and BYU are bigger.  
– Yale and Stanford have $20+ BILLION endowments, Harvard has $36 billion. These large endowments are how those universities can offer “free tuition” to lower-income students.   
 USC’s endowment? $4.7 billion; a mere fraction of these other schools. And yet, USC spends more than twice as much on putting money back into the Financial Aid budget than, say Stanford ($400 million vs. $168 million).  USC’s financial aid benefits 11,000 students.  Stanford’s financial aid? Benefits 3,400 students.  So, they can afford to give larger awards because a) they have more money in general; and b) they are giving it to far fewer students.
The comparison to smaller, wealthier institutions I’m sure is flattering (and even encouraged), but USC is not Harvard. Such comparisons are apples and… watermelons.  USC operates the large majority of their expenses from tuition and fees, and the endowment understandably plays a smaller role in their annual expenses than at schools like Harvard and Stanford.  USC is not-for-profit; every tuition dollar must go back to operate or invest in the institution in some form.  
 Could USC do better? Always.  
Is more transparency a good thing? Absolutely.  
 But I believe that context is everything, and I don’t think they get credit for the good things they are doing which impact the net price of 60% of their 19,000 students.
All of this information is available for anyone who bothers to look.  This is not just a USC problem, it is a national higher education problem. Although USC would be wise to figure out a solution for their unique position as a very large private institution to develop a more sustainable model of tuition pricing.  And soon.
Thank you for sharing, Gio. I truly hope Nikias reads this and takes it to heart.
Thank you for your heartfelt plea to President Nikias, Mr. Moujaes. It makes  no sense that an education at USC should cost more than one at Stanford Harvard or Yale.

Most people have only seen New Zealand in movies — specifically, the Lord of the Rings series. After spending the past weekend visiting two of the most famous Lord of the Rings shooting locations in New Zealand, I’m happy to report that the country looks exactly like it does in the movies.
Now, I’m not a diehard Lord of the Rings fan. I’ve never read the books and my butt might go numb if I had to watch all three movies in one day. But I am fascinated by the detail that was put into creating this world known as “Middle Earth” and how this imaginary place has become synonymous with New Zealand.
My first stop was Tongariro National Park, which was used to portray the evil wasteland known as Mordor in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. At the start of the hike, I was wondering whether I was even in the right place. The land was covered with delicate purple flowers and soft shrubs that looked like coral. It didn’t look even remotely creepy, and I wasn’t sure whether to be impressed or disappointed that it took a whole lot of movie magic to make this landscape into Mordor.
Meghan Coyle | Daily Trojan
But of course, New Zealand’s landscape changes drastically in just a few hundred meters. I walked a little further and came across a barren landscape with ancient volcanic rocks. Now, we’re talking. The hike was so high up on the mountain that the clouds hugged the ground like an eerie fog.
Meghan Coyle | Daily Trojan
The most recognizable feature of this location is Mount Ngauruhoe, which is known as Mount Doom in the Lord of the Rings movies. Some people even hike to the summit and throw a ring in to honor Frodo’s epic journey. Even though I didn’t venture there myself, I’m pretty sure that it’s not a bubbly lava pit.
Meghan Coyle | Daily Trojan
Even so, this mountain is impressive in that it stands out against the barrenness that surrounds it. There are no trees on Mount Doom. There are long stretches of flat land around it with nothing but rocks. There’s a huge crater nearby known as “Red Crater,” where you can actually see the steam being released from steam vents. It smells like sulfur. I’m sure if Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson could have put that smell into his movies, he would have.
Next, I visited Hobbiton, the movie set that was used for filming scenes of the Shire. The iconic little round doors are built into the sides of beautiful, green rolling hills of a working farm. The only way to visit Hobbiton is with a guided tour, and my tour guide seemed to think Peter Jackson was a little insane. For example, Jackson insisted on planting apple and pear trees, instead of the plum trees described in the books, because he felt that the plum tree’s’ trunk and branches did not match the rest of the set. He then had his crew attach plums and plum leaves to the apple and pear trees by hand. These “plum trees” never made it into the movies.
Meghan Coyle | Daily Trojan
Despite my tour guide’s attitude, I appreciated the attention to detail put into Hobbiton, from the clotheslines to the mailboxes. Those little things made this imaginary world come to life, and that’s what makes it worth visiting.
The Lord of the Rings locations in New Zealand still feel alive. I’ve been to movie set locations in plenty of places in the United States, and they’ve felt empty. I’ve seen the backlots of Paramount Studios and Universal Studios. I’ve seen the Godzilla footprint that’s still imprinted on a hillside in Hawaii. But the Lord of the Rings locations in New Zealand don’t need the epic soundtrack and tiny hobbits to make it special. This place already has the character it needs to take your imagination to a fantasy land.
