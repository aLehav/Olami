Officials are investigating the death of a student at a residence hall on the Health Sciences Campus, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed on Thursday. 
Jacob Kelley, a 24-year-old first-year master’s student, was found at Seaver Residence Hall on Wednesday afternoon. 
Detective David Alvarez, a detective with LAPD’s Hollenbeck Community Police Station said that the cleaning crew of the residence hall detected a foul scent and found the student dead in his apartment. He had been deceased for approximately seven days.
The Los Angeles Coroner’s office has taken over the investigation after a preliminary examination by LAPD. 
Alvarez also said that the body showed no sign of trauma and that the room displayed no sign of a struggle. LAPD is currently awaiting an autopsy to discover the cause of his death.
Rohit Varma, dean of the Keck School of Medicine, sent out a letter today notifying students, faculty and staff at Keck of Kelley’s death. Varma also wrote that the student’s family had been contacted.
“Please keep the Kelley family in your thoughts during this difficult time,” the letter read.
The Seaver Residence Hall declined to comment.

The USC football team returned to Howard Jones Field on Wednesday for their second practice since the start of the school year. Team roles began to become more defined as the team approaches its opening matchup against Western Michigan next Saturday — and the practice also featured a special guest.
Freshmen Take the Stage
The Trojan freshmen have been at the height of media interest this week, not only for their contributions to practice, but also because this is the first week they’ve been available for interviews.
Freshman defensive tackle Marlon Tuipulotu thanked the upperclassmen for helping ease his transition to college ball.
“They’re all helping out the young guys,” he said, naming in particular redshirt senior Kenny Bigelow Jr. and senior Josh Fatu. Along with his work as a mentor, Fatu is also standing out on the practice field as well, taking most of the first-team reps at nose tackle.
Freshman defensive lineman Jay Tufele praised Talamaivao, redshirt junior Toa Lobendahn and redshirt junior Chris Brown. 
“They’re amazing athletes, and going against them is like going against the best in the world,” Tufele said.
Though not technically a first-year player, redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns was raring to finally make his Trojan debut after spending 2016 confined to the practice field.
“I have a fire in me,” Vaughns said, before adding that he would “hopefully be starting” against Western Michigan.
Making Dreams Come True
Taylor Hammond, a 10-year-old who has been battling leukemia for four years, made an appearance at Wednesday’s practice as one of the wishes on his “life list.”
Taylor got to take part in a drill with the Trojans: Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold threw him a pass, which Taylor ran to the end zone with defenders chasing after him, falling to the ground one by one in his wake.
Taylor’s father, Brian Hammond, was also in attendance and was passing out bracelets to players, fans and reporters, encouraging everyone to keep children like Taylor in their thoughts when they wear the bracelets. Taylor, his father and his brother were able to pose for the media to complete his true celebrity experience.
“[Taylor] is the definition of ‘Fight On,’” head coach Clay Helton said.
Injury Update
This week USC football continues its rigorous practice schedule leading up to their home opener against Western Michigan next Saturday. Notable absences included freshman offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker and senior guard Viane Talamaivao, as they remained sidelined with hamstring and foot injuries, respectively.
Redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe remained limited in his involvement with a hip flexor injury that has had him playing tentatively for a couple of weeks. Helton has admitted he wants to proceed with caution to prevent the injury from getting any worse.

As anticipation builds for this year’s US Open, Trojan tennis fans will get to see at least two familiar faces competing in the tournament next week. Six former USC men’s tennis players are in New York City — five members of the 2012 NCAA champion team as well as 2008 national doubles champ Robert Farah — looking to make a splash in the Grand Slam, provided they qualify.
Farah and Steve Johnson are the only two Trojans already in the main draw. Farah, a 10-time ATP doubles titlist, is ranked No. 26 globally in doubles and will compete in the doubles bracket.
Johnson is likely the most recognizable name in the group. The 27-year-old garnered international attention in June when he made an emotional underdog run in the French Open. He is ranked No. 46 in the world in singles and No. 146 in doubles. He also owns three overall ATP titles (two for singles, one for doubles). Johnson also won a bronze medal in doubles at the 2016 Summer Olympics — beating Farah en route to glory in Rio de Janeiro — and he will enter both brackets in Flushing Meadows.
The remaining four Trojans hoped to play themselves into the main draw, but Daniel Nguyen’s journey came to an end in the first round of the qualifying rounds. Nguyen was making his first-ever US Open singles appearance, losing to Darian King 6-2, 6-1 on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Ray Sarmiento and Yannick Hanfmann kept the dream alive in their overall US Open debuts, each winning his first-round matchup. Sarmiento edged Benjamin Bonzi 6-2, 6-3 to advance, but he will face a stiff challenge next in Tim Smyczek, who has qualified for the main draw for the past four years and even advanced to the third round of the singles bracket in 2013.
Hanfmann bested Prajnesh Gunneswaran 6-1, 6-4, and he faces a less-imposing roadblock to the final round of qualifying. Hanfmann will take on fellow rookie Vaclav Safranek in the second round with his opponent coming off a grueling, three-set victory on Tuesday.
Roberto Quiroz was the last Trojan to play his first-round qualifying match, and he opened his US Open career with a thrilling three-set loss to Adrian Menendez-Maceiras on Wednesday. Quiroz stumbled out of the gate, dropping the opening set 6-2, but he battled to take the second 6-4.
But after holding serve throughout the decisive third set, Quiroz was broken in his final game of the night, which handed Menendez-Maceiras a 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 victory.
Two Trojans remain standing in the qualifying bracket as the US Open will officially kick off on Monday. Johnson will set his sights on a deeper Cinderella run in his home major, and Farah will hope to carry his ATP success over to the Grand Slam level. It remains to be seen how many former USC teammates will join the duo in the main draw, if any.

The Boston Celtics were clearly in “rebuild mode” after the days of Doc Rivers, and many questioned president Danny Ainge’s ability to erase that label. 
As of last year, the Celtics had come a long way, led by 5-foot-9 point guard Isaiah Thomas and appearing to be the second best team in the East. But there was something missing when the C’s fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Celtics, who were a playoff-caliber team built on stingy defense, had an undersized prolific playmaker in Thomas. He was an obvious hindrance on the defensive end at times, and there was little he could do about it.  When he was limited offensively versus better squads, the Celts would have their backs against the wall if no one filled his void. Against what looked like a very determined team in the Cavaliers, Thomas and the Celtics didn’t have much of a chance.
This offseason, Ainge isn’t going quiet into the night. He’s shaking up the roster big time after acquiring All-Star Gordon Hayward in July. And recently, the wildest occurrence is the arrival of Kyrie Irving via a trade that sent Thomas, Jae Crowder, 2017 first-rounder Ante Zizic and Brooklyn’s 2018 first-round pick to Cleveland.
Anyone who says Crowder and Thomas were integral to the Celtics in last season is right. But the C’s still have the services of Al Horford, an improved Marcus Morris and promising youngsters Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. With Hayward, Irving and head coach Brad Stevens, the Celtics squad could’ve lost Horford or never signed Morris and would remain a main contender in the East. I’m saying this because Hayward and Irving alone should change the game for Stevens, a one-of-a-kind coach with a knack for competing regardless of the talent at his disposal.
The question I ask myself is, how much simpler do Irving and Hayward make Stevens’ job? He can win with a rag tag group, but that isn’t to say he can contend for a crown without high-caliber ballers like Irving and Hayward. Stevens needs someone to shoulder the burden of scoring and playmaking, and Irving wants to be that guy. Stevens coached Hayward at Butler University, and is probably very familiar with the former Utah Jazz standout’s evolution from college to present day. 
The main drawbacks of this trade could be a) in the long term — Zizic turns out to be one of the best big men in the NBA, or b) in the short term — Thomas and Crowder perfectly supplement Kevin Love and an aging LeBron James to win the East. While the first possibility is somewhat of an unknown value given the unpredictability of NBA first rounders, the second option is not entirely out of the question.
But the bottom line is the highest expectations will have to trump the reality of the Golden State Warriors’ existence. Somehow, the Warriors will have to crash and burn for a title to be within the Celtics’ grasp. The primary way I can see that happening is through injuries. But the same thing can happen to the Celtics and Cavs as well, and it would probably hit them harder than the depth-heavy Warriors. 
The Warriors, though, are a bit weaker than you think. Teams can shut down Steph Curry and Klay Thompson on the perimeter. But with the long-armed, multi-skilled Durant, most defenders are at a significant disadvantage when matching up with him. So for me, Durant is that one player on the Warriors that matters the most to their championship desires.
Due to the defensive liability aspect, I would rather lose Thomas to injury than Irving. However, that means if the Celtics were to lose Irving to injury in playoff time, their ability to win would very noticeably diminish. After all, Irving was the man who delivered magnificent performances  game after game when the headlines read that James had brought the title home. The 2017-18 season is Irving’s extended moment to show the world how gifted he is without James.
I don’t think you can say the Cavaliers drop off the map with this trade, although they are most definitely not any closer to beating the Warriors. LeBron James’ opportunity to win another championship with the Cavaliers should be finished. But it’s not, really, because although he was mortal versus the Warriors in the 2017 finals, he’s one of the best of all time. So it’s tough to rule him and his team out, even though many would agree that he’s out of his prime as he approaches his mid-30’s.
It’s under these circumstances that lofty predictions exist for the C’s with Irving and Hayward taking over, and all signs point to a much awaited Cavs-Celtics rematch in the playoffs, where Irving can show LeBron James who’s boss.
