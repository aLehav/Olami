Though the majority of Americans plan to avoid using credit cards this holiday season, the use of credit cards has been increasing at USC as cash payments have become less prevalent.
Swipe · Though cash spending tends to increase during recessions, USC students are increasingly using credit cards to add money to their discretionary accounts. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
According to a survey from media company Triton Digital released Monday, 52 percent of Americans plan to use cash pay for gifts during the holidays in an effort to avoid credit card debt.
USCard, however, has noticed a decline in the amount of cash  deposited to discretionary accounts for the last three years at a rate of about 21 percent per year, according to Bernie Moreno, interim director for USCard services.
“Trending for deposit is going away from cash,” Moreno said. “This is even true for the value transfer station [in the basement of Leavey Library where students can transfer funds]. The trend has been pushing away from cash for sometime.”
Moreno said he feels the convenience factor of using a credit card rather than depositing cash is important for college students.
“Using cell phones, using computers, there really is no need to visit our customer service center unless you feel the need to give cash or write a check,” Moreno said. “Students are really embracing technology.”
Some students said they prefer credit cards because they are easier to carry.
“I always use credit cards because it’s more convenient and I get a lot of change, which usually accumulates in my room,” said Chaitanya Murthy, a senior majoring in chemical engineering.
Kadra Alvaro, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, said there are some benefits to using cash.
“Sometimes I feel like it’s easier to regulate spending if you have cash because you can see it leaving more than if you are swiping a card,” Alvaro said.
Still, many students said cash has become a hassle.
“It’s easier,” said Darren Chiu, a freshman majoring in biochemistry. “You don’t have to hold that much cash and there’s no change involved.”
Indeed… I know several people who use Mommy and Daddy’s credit cards on a regular basis, for everything. I even used to work with a guy at a work-study job who didn’t tell his parents he had a job. They just gave him their credit card with the impression he wasn’t working. He used it to pay for everything, and saved his cashed work-study paychecks for booze. There’s a growing divide between students at USC who work hard and take out huge loans to go to school here, and a group of students who ride along on their family’s riches. I don’t feel too bad though… Its those of us who know how to make a budget, spend wisely, and save money who will succeed (in the long term). Sure, these credit card wielding kids will probably be the ones who graduate and initially go on to fabulous law schools and cool Hollywood internships, but won’t eventually know how to live a life that won’t eventually resemble their hope of a Laguna Beach life.
The credit card in the photo is a Cal credit card… come on DT… come on…
Haha..umm let’s be real, the actual reason USC uses credit cards is because the majority of us have rich parents and the easiest way to use their money is via credit card.  Not hating on the rich students here, but if you’re going to post an article about credit card usage at usc, you’re pretty foolish for not including the most obvious reason.
^Amen.

The Undergraduate Student Government is starting the process of pushing for a fall break after successfully extending the Thanksgiving break to include Wednesday.
USG spent two years lobbying to get the administration to make Wednesday part of the holiday weekend.
Though many universities, including Stanford and Yale, get an entire week off for Thanksgiving, USG President Monish Tyagi said a fall break in October would be more beneficial.
“What we are exploring right now is a fall break to help students make their way through the semester,” Tyagi said.
Many students said a fall break would be helpful because it would provide much-needed time off to rest during one of the busiest parts of the semester.
“It gives people some time to go home, decompress and get away from the grind for a bit,” said Drew Gerardi, a senior majoring in psychology.
Tyagi said the next step for adding a fall break to the academic calendar is to determine the opinions of different groups on campus, such as faculty, administration and students.
In an effort to gauge student support for a fall break, USG is in the process of conducting an online poll, the preliminary results of which have been positive, Tyagi said.
“Of the students that we have surveyed so far, almost 90 percent were in favor of a fall break,” Tyagi said.
Some students, however, said they are opposed to incorporating a fall break into the schedule out of concerns that it will lead to a longer school year.
“I would rather not have a fall break because that would extend out the school year,” said Jefferson Trieu, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
To account for the instructional days that would be lost by adding a fall break, Tyagi said USG will examine several options, including the possibility of starting school earlier in the year.
“The next step is looking at all of those options, and seeing what would be best for the university,” Tyagi said.
The preliminary pollings have shown slightly less student support for creating a fall break than for the extension of the Thanksgiving break.
Nearly 95 percent of students interviewed in a USG survey conducted last school year said they were in favor of having an extra day off for Thanksgiving break.
“I think students are very excited about it,” Tyagi said. “It’s nice to have an extra day to travel and not worry about missing classes.”
Though the break was widely supported by the student body, many said it would be more beneficial to have the entire week off.
Skyler Okey, a junior majoring in communication, said she thinks it would be more beneficial to have the whole week off.
“In my high school we had the whole week off and it was absolutely amazing,” Okey said. “I would definitely take a few days extra at the end of school to have the whole week off.”
You kids are just plain lazy!

The USC women’s basketball team knows a lot is on the line.
The Women of Troy (1-2) went into this season ranked No. 23, but following a pair of road losses last weekend, received just nine votes in this week’s Associated Press top-25 poll.
After a loss against No. 12 Georgia last Sunday and an upset by unranked Nebraska 68-50 last Friday, the team will head to the Bahamas for the Junkanoo Jam this weekend.
With the tournament set to start Friday, the Women of Troy will battle No. 2 Notre Dame first, then face either No. 8 Duke or Gardner-Webb on Saturday.
“We’re getting ready for the pressure [defense] we’re gonna see in the next four games, including Notre Dame in the Bahamas,” senior guard Jacki Gemelos said. “It’s a different type of team. The East Coast teams are more pressure-oriented.”
Entering the competition with back-to-back losses might mean USC will be seen as weak, but freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama could not stress the team’s determination enough.
“It’s either go big or go home,” Vaioletama said. “We’re going big, we’re not backing down. It’s good for us to be an underdog, because [Notre Dame] may underestimate us and not know what our strengths and weaknesses are.”
The games against Nebraska and Georgia could have been easy road wins for the Women of Troy. The team’s progress was arguably set back by consecutive losses. The importance of road wins is not only crucial for the team’s record, but also for its ranking.
“We have to go out on the road and get big wins. That’s a big showing, when you’re on the road, for the committee,” senior guard Ashley Corral said. “We need to show that we’re just as good as those top-25 teams.”
Playing such highly ranked teams in the Bahamas will not only give the Women of Troy a shot at redemption, but also a chance to get a taste of what March Madness play would be like.
Notre Dame (3-1) would prove a challenge for any team at this point in its season, but it comes off a recent loss against No. 1 Baylor, while Gardner-Webb has started off its season with a 0-4 record, the first time since 2005 it has boasted such a record.
Duke (3-0) has recently seen a strong performance from reserve Tricia Liston, who scored a career-high 22 points in the Blue Devils’ last game, resulting in a 80-54 victory against Western Kentucky.
“Competing against teams such as Notre Dame and Georgia and Texas A&M on their turf or on a neutral site definitely gets you ready for when you get to play in the tournament,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.
[…] (1-2) have slipped out of a polls after back-to-back waste to Nebraska and No. 10 Georgia (4-0). The hits will many expected continue as USC faces No. 4 Notre Dame (3-1) in a Junkanoo Jam in a Bahamas on […]

The USC men’s basketball team opened the 2011-2012 season earlier this month against Cal State Northridge — a team that finished with a losing record a season ago and remains ineligible for postseason competition this season because of a low Academic Progress Rate score. The NCAA penalizes program with scores below its 925 benchmark.
Student engagement · The Galen Center opened in 2006 and holds men’s and women’s basketball games as well as volleyball matches. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Nonetheless, the opening night game, held at the Trojans’ five-year old Galen Center, drew 5,172 fans, including a packed, standing-room-only student section.
One of the attractions for USC students was a reusable Trojan Fever cup giveaway that is good for free soda refills all season long.
“The students change the atmosphere in the Galen Center, so it is important to fill every game,” said Associate Athletic Director and Director of Marketing Craig Kelley.
The USC athletics-marketing department announced other initiatives to improve attendance for men’s basketball games at Galen Center in an email addressed to students signed by Athletic Director Pat Haden in early November.
Last season, USC averaged just 4,691 fans per game at the 10,258-seat Galen Center, the lowest in the conference, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times two weeks ago.
In an attempt to improve fan attendance, James Slagle, a graduate marketing intern, developed the Trojan Fever Loyalty Program earlier this fall so students can earn points and win prizes each time they attend USC football, men’s and women’s basketball, women’s volleyball, women’s soccer and select men’s water polo home games.
Large sandwich boards have also been strategically placed around campus to increase awareness about basketball game times, in addition to text reminders from the Trojan Text Alerts program.
There will also be free pizza given away in the student section at all games, and more student giveaways are being planned, according to Kelley.
The email from Haden vowed to improve food variety and quality at Galen Center concessions, and indicated plans to implement in-seat ordering by the end of the season.
USC students already have free admission to basketball games, but there are now reduced ticket prices across the board for men’s and women’s basketball games.
In addition, the four entry tunnels at the Galen Center have been painted cardinal and gold and decorated with Trojan imagery to replace the less inviting gray concrete.
“[Athletic Director Pat Haden] has made it clear to fans, students and staff that filling the Galen Center is his priority,” Kelley said. “Our student-athletes deserve the support of their fellow students, and we are here to get them into the Galen Center.”
The players have noticed the large crowds through the first three men’s basketball games of the season.
“I like how the crowd was hyped,” sophomore center Dewayne Dedmon said after the game against Cal State Norhridge. “It was a lot of fun.”
Just to echo the above comment: as an alum, I lost interest in seeing the Trojans come to play out in my out-of-state locale this season after reading they only managed to score 30-something points. For shame.
Doesn’t matter how much they try to improve. While it is nice, the #1 thing that is holding back SC basketball is the coach. You aren’t going to draw crowds and convert people into fans with Kevin O’Neil’s “defense first, offense non-existent” style of coaching. No one wants to see a 42-36 basketball game. USC football scored more against Oregon than USC basketball did against Cal Poly. C’mon Man.

Win number two of the season has proved to be more elusive than the USC men’s basketball team would have liked.
The Trojans (1-3) have been competitive in their first three attempts to earn their second victory, but each time have come up short.
The Trojans come off a home loss to Cal Poly in which they blew an eight-point lead in the second half, which followed a double-overtime loss to Nebraska and a narrow two-point defeat at San Diego State.
“The unfortunate thing is that we are getting our lessons from losing, and we need to take some lessons from winning,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “Losing is a difficult thing to deal with, but it does grow you up.”
The Trojans have been relying heavily on inexperienced players. Three starters, freshman guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley and sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, did not have any Division-I experience before this season, and have experienced some ups and downs.
Moore scored 11 points against Nebraska, but has only combined for 11 points in his other three games.
Wesley is tied for the second-most assists on the team but has yet to connect on his five attempts from beyond the arc.
Dedmon scored 16 points in the season opener against Cal State Northridge, but then recorded a total of 15 points in his next three games.
“It is not time to get down on ourselves,” Moore said.
In close games, USC is missing the leadership and experience of senior guard Jio Fontan, the Trojans’ leading returner in points and assists, who suffered an ACL tear during an exhibition game this summer in Brazil that could sideline him for the entire season.
“The second Jio went down in Brazil, I knew there were going to be some nights like this,” O’Neill said after the game against Cal Poly. “That is not changing. He is not coming back anytime soon.”
The Trojans face Morgan State tonight at home at 7 p.m. The Bears (0-3), who compete in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, return four starters from a team that went 17-14 last season, led by junior forward Dewayne Jackson, who averaged 14.5 points per game.
Over the Thanksgiving holiday, the Trojans will travel to Las Vegas for two games as part of the Las Vegas Invitational.
USC will first compete against UNLV on Friday at 4:30 p.m. The Rebels (4-0) are averaging 85.25 points per game, whereas the Trojans are scoring 54.25 points per contest.
The winner of that game will advance to face the victor between top-ranked North Carolina and  South Carolina on Saturday at 7:30 p.m., and the two losing teams will play at 4:30 p.m.
The Trojans then have two more road games before returning home to face New Mexico on Dec. 10.
“There is a lot of basketball yet to be played,” O’Neill said. “We have to get tougher and better.”

In the impossible task of giving credit where it is due after a hard-fought football game, offensive and defensive lines have begun to attract a bit more attention than they have historically. As the sport continues to change, the need for solid linemen has become glaringly apparent — no matter what type of formation a team faces, consistency and relentlessness are things no squad can win without.
Tough front · Led by a defensive line, including junior Wes Horton, USC ranks 16th nationally in rush defense, allowing 110.7 yards per game. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
But the praise remains limited in scope. Though the sack count for a D-line might be hailed, the game ball will ultimately go to a playmaker more individually distinguishable. This is just a fact of football.
This is why, considering the success of USC football so far this season, there remains a major “pat on the back” left to be given out. For as good as junior quarterback Matt Barkley has been, or any number of running backs, wide receivers, linebackers or defensive backs for the Trojans, no other group has so clearly exceeded expectations like that of the USC linemen on both sides of the ball.
Defensively, the merits are apparent. Entering last Saturday’s game in Oregon with 23 sacks in 10 contests, the defensive line had given opponents — namely Andrew Luck and Stanford — more than a fair share of headaches. Using an explosive pass rush to set the tone, the Trojans have found myriad ways to disrupt some of the best offenses in the nation.
Considering the quality of play we have seen through 10 games, it was to be a bit expected that USC would not give Oregon any easy opportunities to put points on the board last Saturday. But, as has become the trend, the Trojan defensive line went far beyond simply playing a good game.
Led by senior captain Christian Tupou, the unit slowed down an Oregon offense that hadn’t lost in 21 straight games at home. USC’s front line effectively snuffed out much of the running threat that Heisman-hopeful running back LaMichael James presented, and moved on to maintain pressure on Ducks quarterback Darron Thomas.
Though Oregon’s dynamic offense was still able to put up decent statistics, USC’s front four accomplished what they set out to do — keep the furious pace the Ducks set, prevent the big play and ultimately force the Ducks to make mistakes. The fumble that freshman tackle George Uko forced out of James deep in USC territory near the end of the first half prevented a score, which ultimately impacted the direction of the game.
But for as much merit as the defensive line commands, it is its offensive counterpart that has shined brightest.
Supposedly decimated by injury, lacking depth and completely inexperienced, USC’s offensive line was targeted from the beginning of summer practice as the team’s weak link. If you had believed everything you read and watched in the news, it wouldn’t have been hard before the season started to picture the unit as a round-up of some of the heftier guys at USC that had nothing better to do than play football.
But with junior tackle Matt Kalil — who is playing the best football of his career — serving as anchor, the O-line has opened up incredible opportunities for the high-powered Trojan offense to get rolling. The unit ranks fifth in the nation in sacks allowed with four, which in turn has given Barkley the time he needs to execute plays.
Protecting the quarterback isn’t all the offensive line has succeeded at, either — consider the sudden emergence of a powerful rushing attack, led by senior Marc Tyler and junior Curtis McNeal. The two have combined for 1,418 yards and nine touchdowns, thanks in large part to the holes the O-line has created.
Though it might be hard to prove the worth of the offensive line on paper, one glance at the squad’s play is all you need to see how far it has progressed in just 11 games.
And if growth like that can be achieved in the course of a season, Trojan fans can get excited. Only senior Martin Coleman will graduate at the end of this year, leaving scholarship-depleted USC with a bevy of depth for the coming years.
It’s safe to say this has been somewhat of a coming-out season for the Trojans. On both sides of the ball, the team has executed and found ways to succeed, despite overwhelming criticism that pervades the public perception.
But in looking for those to praise for the impressive feats accomplished so far this season, remember the linemen who are so rarely put in the spotlight. Without their stellar play, it’s safe to say the Trojans wouldn’t be at the top looking down.

A top-10 finish is within sight. A double-digit win season is a realistic possibility. But standing in the way is crosstown rival UCLA.
On the rise · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley helped lead USC to a 38-35 upset victory last week at Oregon. A win on Saturday against UCLA would be the Trojans’ 10th victory of the season and mark the first time since 2008 they finished with double-digit wins. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
No. 10 USC, winners of six of its last seven contests, and UCLA (6-5, 5-3) will meet for the 81st time in one of college football’s most intense rivalries Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Bruins will travel across town as winners of their last three of four contests. With a win over the Trojans (9-2, 6-2) — or a Utah loss vs. Colorado — UCLA could clinch the Pac-12 South division title. Despite coming off a big win against then-No. 4 Oregon, the USC coaching staff believes the team will not overlook the Bruins.
“This team will be focused,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I don’t think it’ll be hard at all. Because our kids played with these kids growing up, this is the biggest rivalry game and it means a lot.”
Though UCLA’s offense ranks just 75th in the nation, averaging 25 points per game, it did score a season-high 45 points against Colorado last weekend. Quarterback Kevin Prince has thrown for just 1,202 yards and eight touchdowns all year, but four of those touchdown passes came last weekend against the Buffaloes. Prince has, however, amassed an average of 79.5 rushing yards per contest over the last four games. Tailback Jonathan Franklin leads the team with 857 rushing yards, while also recording five touchdowns and wide receiver Nelson Rosario has notched 890 receiving yards and two touchdowns this season.
On the other side of the ball, the Bruins’ defense ranks 81st in the country, giving up an average of 29 points and almost 400 yards per contest.
In his career, though, junior quarterback Matt Barkley has recorded just 404 passing yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions against UCLA. This season, Barkley has thrown for 3,105 yards and 33 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. After his performance against the Ducks — it was his fifth career game at USC with at least 300-plus passing yards and four or more touchdowns — the coaching staff believes the signal caller deserves an invitation to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony next month.
“I thought Matt did some really good things [against Oregon],” Kiffin said. “For the most part, he played really well and made a lot of big plays in the game. If you look at the way he’s played in big games, which is supposed to matter, I don’t see how he’s not in New York.”
Wide receivers freshman Marqise Lee and sophomore Robert Woods have combined for 22 of Barkley’s touchdowns and more than 2,000 receiving yards. The running game has also come on strong as of late. Junior tailback Curtis McNeal notched 94 rushing yards against Oregon — his sixth straight game with at least 85 yards on the ground. Part of that success can be attributed to the play of the offensive line, whose play has improved throughout the season, according to the players.
“They’re playing awesome,” Barkley said of the unit following the Oregon game. “Our offensive line is opening up running holes like none other. They’re kind of a mixed up group in the beginning of the season, but they’ve come together to play as a unit. I’m proud of these guys.”
The Trojans’ defense has also improved as the season has progressed, limiting the Oregon offense to just 35 points — 11 below its average — and 209 rushing yards, after coming in averaging more than 290 yards per contest. The play of its young linebackers — redshirt freshmen Hayes Pullard and Dion Bailey, and freshmen Tre Madden and Lamar Dawson — has been a key reason for the defensive unit’s strong play.
“We’ve come a long way just since last year, from the Arizona game and until now,” sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey said. “We have a lot of young guys and they believe what we’re preaching. To see a young defense come from the struggles in the early season and to see us improve shows we’re just getting better, and that’s what matters.”
Coming off an emotional win over a top-five team and the hype surrounding the USC-UCLA rivalry this weekend, the Trojans understand they cannot overlook the Bruins, no matter what records indicate.
“Going into UCLA, we definitely don’t overlook anybody, especially a rivalry game,” redshirt freshman Randall Telfer said. “They can easily beat us and they’re a good football program. We’ll continue to [work hard] this week and hopefully we can bring home a win on Saturday.”
Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. and the game will be televised on Fox Sports Network.

After the turkey is gobbled up and the food coma has passed, millions of Americans will wake up the day after Thanksgiving extra early to start shopping and save money.
For this year’s Black Friday, sales look better than ever with stores opening earlier than in years past. With a college budget, it’s the perfect day to save big and get great gifts for yourself and those you love.
Granted, parking can be a nightmare and long lines can scare you away. Plus, Cyber Monday brings plenty of temptations to shoppers including free shipping and reduced prices. You can even shop on television these days as QVC celebrates Black Friday during dinner time.
Nonetheless, the deals you can find in stores are absolutely worth the craziness. Here’s a sneak peek at some of the available deals this Black Friday that might leave you pulling an all-nighter.
Apartment/Dorm Room Essentials
Walmart, which opens at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving day, has a wide variety of items perfect for student housing. A Bissell 3-in-1 vacuum costs $8.50. For $3, you can choose between a waffle maker and a mini chopper for the kitchen. Bath towels are less than $1. Finally, a microfiber sheet set is priced at $7.
Macy’s department stores will open doors at midnight, providing a wide variety of gadgets and items for the college home. There will be hundreds of early bird specials to choose from including a brownie, donut, quesadilla or smiley face pancake maker for $9 each. Plus, you can get $10 off a purchase of $25 or more if you bring a coupon from the newspaper ad delivered on Thanksgiving day.
Electronics
Known for having customers line up days in advance, Best Buy opens at midnight with huge electronic deals. The sought-after item that will likely grab people’s attention is the Sharp 42-inch LCD 1080p HDTV priced at less than $200. If you want it, it might be smart to get to your local store days in advance; there’s a minimum of just 10 available per store.
For those who will be waiting in line for other items such as 99 cent DVDs including Bruno, Rocky Balboa and Casino Royale, select Best Buy stores will have an outdoor screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 hours before the store opens.
For gaming fans, Target has Xbox 360s advertised for $140 when the stores also open their doors at midnight. If game systems aren’t on your list, select iTunes gift cards valued at $25 will be sold for $20.
Finally, Walmart stores open their doors even earlier at 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving day. Their electronic deals, however, begin two hours later at midnight. For starting photographers, the Kodak 14 megapixels digital camera is less than $50. Plus, everyone’s favorite classic DVDs including Bride Wars, Bourne Ultimatum, 300, He’s Just Not That Into You and others are on sale for less than $2.
Clothes
Clothing stores are doing all they can to get consumers in their doors first with some of the greatest deals for shoppers.
Old Navy is opening doors at midnight with $15 jeans for adults and $5 graphic tees for everyone in the family. Plus, you’ll score a free Kodak Easy Share waterproof digital camera valued at more than $100 if you spend $40 or more. There is always a catch; the sale is only while supplies last and Old Navy shoppers love their promotions so they will go fast.
If you will be traveling to the local mall, H&M is giving a scratch-off card valued up to $300 to the first 100 customers in line for its 5 a.m. opening. It will also promote fashion finds including dresses and sweaters for as low as $5.
While you are browsing around, stop by Express, which has everything 40 percent off until noon on Black Friday as well as all of Thanksgiving day.
Finally, for the first time ever, Kohl’s will award card members $15 in “Kohl’s cash” for every $50 they spend. With handbags and wallets 50 to 60 percent off, Lauren Conrad and Elle collections 40 to 50 percent off and hundreds of other early-bird specials midnight to 1 p.m., shoppers will have no problem opening up their wallets.
For best results, make sure to have a game plan when starting your Black Friday adventure. Study your ads Thanksgiving day and come Friday morning, you will be amazed at how much you accomplished off your list and most importantly, how much you saved.

A guidance counselor at San Diego State University once told Harvey Kubernik he had no communication skills. On top of that, the SDSU student newspaper rejected his application to be a staff writer.
So when he started getting published in outlets like the Los Angeles Free Press, many journalism and English majors he knew who were struggling to get jobs wrote into the paper complaining that he had no right to have those kinds of opportunities.
Purple haze · Harvey Kubernkik’s latest book, A Perfect Haze: The Illustrated History of the Monterey International Pop Festival, takes an in-depth look at the iconic concert and its performers. - Photo courtesy of Santa Monica Press
“They didn’t have my rock’n’roll soul,” Kubernik said. “They were just robots taking college classes.”
Kubernik, a renowned rock journalist and the co-author (with his brother Kenneth) of the recently published A Perfect Haze: The Illustrated History of the Monterey International Pop Festival, could probably talk all night about the history of music, counterculture, literature and the icons and practitioners of these movements.
He’s the author of four books, each of which uniquely touches on the personalities behind the modern music that has shaped American culture. But his most recent publication probably ranks as his most personal work.
“All books reflect your life and who you are, but it’s only personal because this one is not exclusively about me — it’s kind of about a festival and how myself and my brother serve the festival,” Kubernik said. “The festival is always the star of this book.”
Though the Monterey International Pop Festival — which took place in 1967’s “Summer of Love” — carries its fame in the unforgettable image of Jimi Hendrix burning his guitar, the Kuberniks’ book serves as a testament to the festival’s greater importance as a world-changing moment of many characters and energy.
It’s a vivid portrait of a time when popular music served the cosmic consciousness rather than individual egos — a time when Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones wandered the festival grounds without an entourage or bodyguard; a time when Jimi Hendrix casually went shopping for flowers on his free afternoons. The book furthers the intensely human quality of the images provided by documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker’s 1968 film Monterey Pop.
“That really kind of shows you that everybody wasn’t star-struck and there weren’t the safety concerns that have kind of emerged in the last few decades at rock concerts and everything,” Kubernik said. “It adds to a different world we’re visiting.”
Kubernik has been compiling interviews, images and media surrounding the festival since 1997, and his attachment to the festival dates back to the first time he saw the 1968 film with a girl he asked out on a date in high school.
“A whole new world was exposed to me,” Kubernik said. “I had been aware of this world. I had some of the albums from these people already. I knew who they were. I had read about them. It was being touted on the radio.”
After marinating on the thought of doing a book on the subject, Kubernik decided to include his brother (also a music journalist) because of the extended knowledge and perspective he could bring to the project.
“Since so many siblings don’t get along with each other, we thought we’d show one time they can work together. You know those ‘I don’t talk to my brother’ or ‘I don’t talk to my sister’ people?” Kubernik said. “We’re determined not to have that.”
The Kuberniks grew up going to many shows together, and the brothers have steeped their consciousness in the memory of Monterey.

Not everyone can get to a gym, and with a busy schedule, I’m in the same boat. The hectic schedule on top of time constraits can make it hard to exercise, yet my interest led me to efforts in martial arts such as krav maga, practicing kettlebells and a number of other exercises. But there is a much more basic solution to the problem than I realized.
A simple way to build strength — and not necessarily muscle mass — is to do plyometrics. Plyometrics are fast body weight exercises focused on rapid muscle contraction and expansion that take advantage of muscle elasticity to build strength. Ideally, plyometrics also increase body speed, making them great for runners and cyclists.
Part of what makes plyometrics so effective is they play into the body’s myotatic reflex, which is when muscles contract automatically when stretched to a certain point. By actively forcing this motion, it creates a quicker contraction within each muscle group, while at the same time getting the benefits from stretching.
There is one problem. If your ankles or wrists are not strong enough you can cause injury because of the sudden stress on the body. It’s best to avoid plyometrics if you’re just starting out with strength training. They’re great for building on a base of strength, but without that base, plyometrics can be a bit dangerous. At the very least, be sure to warm up your body by rolling your wrists and ankles.
Most plyometric exercises are simple and isolated to certain body parts. For the lower body, try box jumps.
Box jumps and step-ups, even when done in a no-rest, rapid succession, might not seem like they are speed-oriented, but that boost of strength and the quick movements involved can actually increase a runner’s speed and endurance.
Find a solid box or a platform around three to four feet in height. Then, standing in front with no momentum, jump on top of the box, and then jump back down. Immediately jump back up, with no rest or pause between jumps. If you can’t do that, when you land on the ground, take a quick hop and then jump, to avoid losing momentum.
This might seem easy, but doing a set of 25 is a true test of one’s strength and endurance.
For the upper body, it’s best to do clap pushups, a variation on the standard exercise that works in the rapid contraction and expansion of plyometrics. Pushups are supposed to be measured, controlled descents and ascents, grounded by the hands on aspect of the workout. Clap pushups throw this concept out the window.
The benefits of plyometrics go beyond strength, although that is the base from which the other stem. The explosive moves involved in plyometrics boost agility; these fast shifts in muscle contraction make your reaction time quicker. These moves also serve to strengthen bone density.
Other exercises are more geared toward full body strength, which is excellent if you’re short on time. The first is a step-up. Taking the platform or box you would use in box jumps, raise one foot on top and then with that foot, push yourself up into a jump, all while keeping your arms raised over head. As with box jumps, a set of around 25 repetitions offers a great workout that’s challenging, no matter how strong you are.
Here the exercise mainly focuses on the lower body, but the arms and back get worked out as well. This is a common move common in parkour, as it helps with climbing over obstacles. Step up, jump, climb and then pull yourself up. It’s an easy and effective way to work the whole body.
But perhaps the best full body plyometric is a burpee. It’s an exercise favored by the military and athletes for its sheer simplicity as a body building move. Standing upright, lower into a squat position — back straight, legs bent at a right angle with the butt sticking back — and then quickly drop into the pushup position. Do a pushup, then immediately return to your feet, pushing up into a jump. Land and immediately repeat by moving to squat.
Exercises like burpees can stretch the core and help strengthen and define the abdominal muscles, without doing any crunches or something along the lines of that.
Plyometrics aren’t the perfect way to build strength, and they definitely won’t pack on muscle.
But, when time is short and options are limited, they are among the most efficient of exercises available.

Thanksgiving is fast approaching, which for many means a trip away from USC to feast and to revel in the comforts of home and family.
New traditions · Students stuck on campus this weekend don’t have to feel limited in their celebratory options. Restaurants like the Original Pantry Cafe and traditional Thanksgiving recipes serve as excellent alternatives. - Kristy Pyke | Daily Trojan
For others, though, the Thanksgiving holiday brings only a quiet couple of days on or around campus, deprived of the traditional festivities of Turkey Day.
Being stuck at USC for the weekend doesn’t have to equate to a lackluster Thursday night of ramen noodles and pro football on TV. If you own a car, the alternatives are obvious: The entire City of Angels will be yours to explore.
But for those of you who don’t have your own transportation and don’t want to rent a car — fear not. There are plenty of ways to fill your Thanksgiving weekend this year in Los Angeles.
The first matter of business regarding Thanksgiving should always be the food. The holiday is a great opportunity to pass up the usual microwave-friendly choices or takeout fare — this time, you can say no to more pasta deliveries.
Thanksgiving Restaurant Edition 
Though many restaurants close for Thanksgiving weekend, a short bus or cab ride up Figueroa Street will land you at the doorstep of the Original Pantry Cafe, which will offer a traditional turkey dinner with all the accoutrements for less than $20. There, you can chat over a pile of the Pantry’s classic sourdough bread — ask for it toasted — and soak in the history and energy of an 87-year-old eatery.
There are more modern takes on the holiday available, too. Conveniently, LA Live features some intriguing eats, including LA Market by Kerry Simon’s take on seasonal food (including a swank $52-per-person Thanksgiving dinner, if you’re willing to splurge).
At-Home Holiday Recipes
But let’s say you want to cook up a Thanksgiving dinner yourself. There’s no need to worry about the logistics of roasting a whole bird — instead, pick up some turkey breasts. You can adjust the seasonings based on what you have — just pat the breasts dry, and season them generously with coarse salt and black pepper, and go from there.
Sage is the classic Thanksgiving herb, but thyme and rosemary are go-to flavors as well. You can go even further with a sage-citrus butter. Get some orange and lemon zest (a vegetable peeler is ideal), mince very finely and mix with some softened unsalted butter. Add chopped sage, combine and then carefully insert spoonfuls of the mixture under the skin of the turkey breast, using your fingers to even it out across the meat.
Place the seasoned breast in a roasting pan. Roast in a 400-degree oven for about 40 minutes until a meat thermometer reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit or until the skin is browned and crisp and the meat’s juices run clear.
Stuffing is easy: Dice some bread (stale French bread works great) into small half-inch inch squares, and fine-dice (1/8 inches) some onion, celery and carrot. No need for measuring cups here — a serving will be roughly a handful of bread cubes and a handful of the chopped vegetables.
Heat a pan over medium-high heat and drop in a tablespoon or so of butter. Then add the bread cubes and toss, toasting the cubes evenly for a few minutes.
Lower the heat to about medium and add the vegetables along with a pinch of salt. Cook until the vegetables soften and the onions look translucent — make sure the mix isn’t browning.
All you need to do to complete the dish is crank the heat up to high, add in a splash of chicken stock/broth and mix. Enjoy.
Long Weekend Events — Raging to Relaxing 
There is more to the holiday weekend than just Thanksgiving dinner, of course. On Friday evening, The Shrine will host the Dayglow Tour, which bills itself as the “world’s largest paint party.” With a paint-splattering crew and the raving sounds of R3HAB and Sidney Samson pumping you up, this might be a good chance to work off some of that Thanksgiving dinner.
If you’d rather go for a little relaxation, take advantage of the long weekend — there are plenty of places just a short distance away that will cater to your needs. Emperory in Downtown Los Angeles, for instance, offers massages of various sorts in a casual and hassle-free setting where you don’t have to disrobe. Best of all, it’s affordable, especially during happy hour — 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. — when an hour-long massage is only $20.
Being stuck at school for Thanksgiving can be the perfect opportunity to try some new things around the city. Though consuming copious amounts of turkey and indulging your gratuitous craving for naps isn’t a bad way to spend the weekend, this year’s Thanksgiving might be the perfect time to get out a little.
Great article Ms. Pyke!  Thank you–You are welcome to come to my house for Thanksgiving!

Occupy strikes misunderstood
In recent weeks, sparks have flown within the USC community around the Occupy movement. As the temperature rises, it becomes vital to discuss the controversial issues that have surfaced. To ensure the productivity of this discussion, however, we must first address a few misconceptions regarding the movement.
Foremost, as delineated on the Occupy Wall Street website, the purpose of the movement is to fight “back against the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process…” and “to expose how the richest 1 percent of people are writing the rules of an unfair global economy.”
Though it would be easy to simply blame the federal government, the Occupy movement takes a more complex look at a system made up of both private enterprise lobbyists and Washington policy makers.
Members of the Occupy movement speak against this multifaceted system that allows the wealthiest to become wealthier, while their taxes sink and national public interests drown in the wake of personal incentives.
Additionally, the movement has renounced party affiliation, and it has seen opposition on both liberal and conservative stages. Much more could be said about Occupy’s fundamentals, but for the sake of brevity, those who wish to comment on the movement are encouraged to read through the website before making statements to praise or critique it.
It is important to keep in mind that every great movement in history has been ridden with factions and controversy. That said, movements are not defined by their most radical components; they are defined by their larger uniting messages.
The Civil Rights movement in the ’50s and ’60s included some individuals with extreme, regressive perspectives.
Today, we do not remember these movements as “racist” or “misandrist.” We remember them as having fought for racial and gender equality, and applaud their brave efforts.
The same perspective must be applied when discussing Occupy, as it stems from a hugely diverse group of people from every echelon of society, including the aforementioned 1 percent.
We acknowledge and condemn any anti-Semitic statements, including the few made among the crowds. The Wall Street protests as a whole are not anti-Semitic, and the bigotry of a few individuals does not define a movement.
Occupy continues to represent the modern fight for equal opportunity and better representation by government.
Finally, we must address the issue of political discourse in our community. Language is powerful and when speech is weighted more with slander than substance, it stifles effective dialogue. Voters are continually dissatisfied with the partisan bickering in our political system.
Furthermore, little is achieved, whether in Congress or on campus, through shame-oriented dialogue. As such, perhaps we should all remind ourselves of the importance of solidarity. Consider the example of the Trojan Family.
As one of the most diverse universities in the nation, our thriving, supportive and ever-expanding network is a cornerstone of our success. This extends to our wonderfully diverse set of political ideologies.
In the spirit of the Trojan Family, we must remember that every person who takes a stand for their views is doing so with the common incentive to improve themselves and their community. Let’s take care with our language and remain diligent in creating healthy forums for political dialogue.
In so doing, the USC community at large will no doubt contribute to the greater efforts to shape the American political system as a less hostile, more thoughtful and more productive democracy.
Keep calm and fight on!
Ximena Velázquez-Arenas
President, USC College Democrats
Tim, ARN, and whoever else is not getting the point (see: word MISUNDERSTOOD in subtitle):
One of the ideas behind Occupy is that there is no equality of opportunity, banks and the 1% rig the game so they will succeed no matter what.  Also by getting rid of Glass-Steagall, the bankers were able to gamble with other people’s money without them realizing it and then they bet against their original bets…they made it so they could not lose.  The whole point is equity not equality but there is not equity in the current system.
America is all about equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.  Get out there and start hustling if you want to improve your economic situation.
The trust-fund kids have spoken! Hahaha! These students are too conservative and need to pull their heads out of their rear ends!  Change is coming and it’s inevitable….just hope that others have pity on you when you’re obsolete thoughts are nothing more than the mumblings of those out of touch with reality!
Right on Ximena!
Consider this dose of reality as well, Miss Velazquez-Arenas:  http://dlombard.livejournal.com/529413.html
ITT: Proof that the Democrats own OWS. The OWS vision is the vision the Democrats have for America. If this was the writer’s personal opinion, it should not have been signed as the President of the USC chapter of College Democrats.
Miss  Velázquez-Arenas, the hypocrisy displayed by you and other democrats is incredible. While the Tea party was largely defined by your ilk by their isolated incidents of racism, the OWS is ” not defined by their most radical components; they are defined by their larger uniting messages.” How convenient. There have been murders, rapes, and defecating on police cars and in the parks, yet of course OWS is not to blame. The Tea Party on the other hand, how dare they protest higher taxes and big government in an organized and well behaved manner. 
I would like to point out that America IS a land of equal opportunity but nowhere is it guaranteed that there should be wealth distribution, the key focus of OWS. I came to the US with $100. Today I am financially independent. There is nothing in this adopted land of mine that stops people from achieving their dreams. Ah except of course we have to work hard for it. Likewise all the folks we admire, Steve Jobs, Larry Page, Larry Ellison, Sergey Brin all started with very little. Today they are the 1%. Do I begrudge them that? NO. I admire them. The OWS folks seem to want things handed to them. Thankfully and not surprisingly there is now very little support among  the American public for them. 
My dear in your defense of the OWS movement, methinks thou protest too much.
Perhaps your admiration of these figures shouldn’t be so blind-sided. Yes some of their accomplishments are great. Our system today makes it difficult/ nearly impossible for small businesses to grow to that extent. The qualms are not quite for wealth distribution as much as they are for an even playing field (and if you look at it carefully it’s not). The movement is about equal opportunity not equal outcome. Just because you were lucky enough to make it in America with just $100 doesn’t mean that it should be our standard. We’re better than that. We’re looking to restore the American Dream because if you look at our day to day lives something’s gone drastically wrong. I refuse to cop-out of a real debate and say it’s the peoples’ faults that they’re in this predicament.
Oh, please. This is the most condescending drivel I’ve read all week.
Criticism of the OWS movement is not rooted in a “misunderstanding” of what it represents. Everyone is well aware that their chief complaint is about wealth distribution. What makes the OWS protesters so roundly criticized and/or ridiculed centers on critical problems with the movement itself:
1) A widespread ignorance among the protesters of even the most rudimentary understanding of how America’s economic system actually works. When I see OWS protesters holding signs demanding things like “a guaranteed income for everyone regardless of employment”, “outlaw credit”, “eliminate all debts”, and “abolish money”, I just shake my head and wonder how these people could be so woefully lacking in not just education but common sense. Monetary exchange, lending, and investment are the foundation of human civilization. Without them we would still be subsistence farmers dying of dysentery before we turned 40.  
2) A complete lack of any coherent and actionable policy goals. “Corporations are greedy” is not a solution, it’s a tantrum. These people need to propose actual solutions that are specific and realistic.
3) A refusal to denounce the violent, criminal. and antisemetic elements that are deeply-rooted within it. The internet is rife with YouTube videos of protesters screaming epithets such as “down with Jew bankers” with no rebuttal from their colleagues. Additionally, many anarchist groups have used the OWS movement as a platform to commit violence against police and business owners, and the OWS “mainstream activists” have not only failed to speak out against them, they have actively endorsed them. For example: a motion by Occupy Berkeley to denounce the looting and vandalism committed by members of the anarchist Black Bloc was roundly defeated by the camp’s General Assembly. Instead, their GA passed (by overwhelming majority) a competing resolution to “respect a diversity of tactics” – this amounts to an explicit endorsement of unacceptable criminal behavior.
The problem with OWS is not that that people are misinterpreting their message, because OWS doesn’t have any coherent message for anyone to understand in the first place.
To Anon: Stop sensationalizing Occupy Wall St.! You’re doing a disservice to anyone who would like to have an actual intellectual debate regarding the merits of the movement. I’d like to respond to the points you raise in your comment:
Firstly, I think it’s safe to say your claims that the protestors are ignorant are largely unfounded. If you have taken any time to go out to our own local Occupy LA you would find that the movement is very organized and is promoting a thought out message. Anecdotal evidence aside, you don’t have any right to sensationalize this movement and downplay it’s core cause. While there may be some vocal minority that may try and promote some anti-semitic agenda (as you claim; I’ve yet to see this myself at any Occupy rally I’ve attended, and I’ve seen about 3 different cities’ rallies) you’re clearly missing the point of the movement. This use of anti semitism for political gain is not only wrong and selfish but highly immoral. 
While I can’t speak for Occupy Cal I think it’s safe to say that there may be a lot of disperse interests taking note of this movement and use it as a platform. A well-read, informed person should be able to discern the differences between the rhetorics of the group. You shouldn’t be discrediting the Occupy movement on the basis that it has attracted some anti-semites. While it is wrong, this has absolutely nothing to do with what the Occupy Wallst. Movement is about. The movement is about our economy. It is focused around “evening the playing field” that is so heavily skewed to favor the wealthy in our country today (look no farther than the access to education over the last two decades).
Next, don’t cop out of a debate by claiming Occupy Wall St. Hasn’t suggested any policy goals. They have set forth their agenda and have made their ideology clear. According to recent census data, ‎100 million Americans (1 in 3) is either under, at, or near the poverty line. Our economy is struggling and OWS is calling for accountability in dealing with the loopholes and financial interests that got us into this mess. Have you noticed how difficult it is to get a loan today? Perhaps you haven’t had to deal directly with this mess but as a result of the shortcomings of our financial system it has become incredibly difficult today to procure a loan to buy a home or start a business. If you are unfamiliar with some of these problems or some of the proposed policy agendas of Occupy Wall St. I would read this article for starters: http://goo.gl/VbKCR 
Finally don’t sell yourself short. It’s a protest. You’re not going to find their specific policies or plans of action on their signs (the regulations probably won’t fit ;) ) I’m glad you’ve gained some financial expertise because I still come across accounts from PhD economists that don’t show a consensus on how our monetary systems and markets work.  Imagine if we took all the Tea Parties signs seriously.
These movements deserve a fair chance to be heard. We shouldn’t begin by sensationalizing them to discredit their points and concerns. It’s just as wrong for the left to do this to the tea party as it is for you to try to do to Occupy Wall St. Try and judge the movement from what it is proposing.
-Concerned student reader.
I wish someone would read “The Ant and the Grasshopper” to these overgrown children.  Perhaps if they spent some time working or doing something productive, they wouldn’t have the need to walk around in circles wondering why life is so unfair to them.

The day after Thanksgiving doesn’t only mean leftover turkey or tofu turkey sandwiches. It is Black Friday, the day that kicks off the holiday shopping season. Companies turn large profits on Black Friday with early opening times and bargains.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Since the advent of the first commercial online services provided by CompuServe and The Source in 1979, people have increasingly been taking advantage of the Internet to purchase various products conveniently and to create a new way to earn profit: virtual goods.
Most transactions on the Internet deal with tangible items. In recent years, however, more and more people have begun to focus on purchasing and possessing virtual goods, intangible items that can only be used in specific online services such as online games or communities.
USC’s Marshall School of Business, one the most well-known business schools in the United States, must realize the emerging importance of virtual goods and become part of this rising business by providing classes on virtual goods.
Zynga, a major company working with this emerging new branch of business, sells virtual goods to more than 200 million active users. These active users use virtual currency earned to purchase virtual goods in most of Zynga’s games, which invert the traditional pay-first model of online video games and provide free gaming experiences to a vast amount of users through platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.
Many people who wish to get their hands on virtual goods without sacrificing valuable time can exchange real money for virtual currency and immediately become rich in games.
The reasons people pay real dollars for something that is neither tangible nor valuable beyond the context of games are complex: Some want to enjoy the feeling of being rich that they cannot achieve in real life; some want to surpass their friends or foes in online games to gain a sense of superiority; some even think the possession of virtual goods represents a second life free from the limited reality.
In 2010, Zynga raked in $1 billion through this new business and it intends to enlarge its investments this year. There is no indication this new branch of business will stop its continued success as more and more consumers become active customers of virtual goods, further enlarging online communities and their social influence.
Classes on virtual goods should be more than just technical or factual knowledge of how to make profits in this new branch of business.
The underlying reasons for the rise of virtual products and the social impact on what people are willing to buy and how much they want to spend in the future should be another main topic of study in the business school.
Certainly, further observations and investigations are necessary before USC starts to invest a large amount of resources into this new area because the business of virtual goods is still fairly new and needs to stand the test of time. It is unclear whether increasing markets and profits will continue in the following years.

The set up: Does it even need to be explained? The Ducks were ranked 4th in the BCS. They were fresh off a dominating 53-30 victory over Stanford in Palo Alto. A win would clinch them the Pac-12 North title. They were staring at an outside shot at a national championship berth. The Trojans hadn’t won in the state of Oregon since 2005. As the public address announcer informed everyone before the game, “it (was) 40 degrees. There (was) a seven mile-per-hour wind. It (was) overcast, with a chance of rain.” It was not a setting for the Trojans to pull off the upset.
The story: But they did. Oregon kicker Alejandro Maldonado missed a game-tying 37 yard field goal attempt wide left as time expired, and the Trojans escaped with a stunning 38-35 victory. The win is without a doubt the biggest in Lane Kiffin’s tenure as head coach, the so-called “signature victory” that he had yet to achieve, according to many.
“To break the longest home winning streak in the country says a lot about this team and how far they’ve come,” Kiffin said. “The way these guys have come together these last five or six weeks is great to see.”
USC jumped out in front early behind a beautiful 59 yard touchdown strike from Matt Barkley to Marqise Lee. Then Barkley led the Trojans on a 66 yard scoring drive, this time finding Robert Woods from 12 yards out to give USC a 14-0 lead.
Oregon cut the lead to 14-7 after they went 88 yards in just over two minutes, but the Trojans answered right back as Barkley again hit Woods on 3rd & goal for a 21-7 advantage.
The Ducks looked as though they would get one score back before halftime, having driven to the USC nine. But USC safety Jawanza Starling recovered a LaMichael James fumble with just 23 seconds remaining in the half to preserve the 14 point lead.
“That was a huge turnaround for us,” said cornerback Nickell Robey. “They were about to score and change the momentum of the game. Jawanza (Starling) came up with a huge recovery and it made a huge difference.”
On the Duck’s first possession of the second half the Trojans forced a three-and-out, and then blocked the ensuing punt, setting up a 26 yard field goal to give USC a 24-7 lead. The teams traded touchdowns, and then the Trojans again found the end zone on their next drive, as Randall Telfer found the endzone from five yards out to give USC a 38-14 lead.
But Oregon was not about to go quietly. DeAnthony Thomas, a former USC commit who spurned the Trojans for Oregon, took the ensuing kickoff 96 yards to the endzone. The legendary Autzen Stadium crowd, so quiet for most of the game, was back in it.
The Ducks scored on their first drive of the fourth quarter, moving 75 yards in two minutes to cut their deficit to 38-27.
Then a Barkley pass intended for Telfer was tipped and intercepted at the Oregon 40 yard line. The Ducks put the ball in the endzone from there in just under 90 seconds, and their two point conversion attempt was successful. Just like that, it was a three point game.
But the Trojan offense responded, methodically moving the ball downfield and eating more than four minutes of clock as they drove to the Oregon 11. And then the unthinkable happened. A botched handoff occurred between Tyler, a fifth year senior, and Barkley, a captain, dynamic team leader and three-year starter at quarterback. The Ducks pounced on the loose ball, and their dynamic offense was give two-and-a-half minutes to move 86 yards.
The Ducks eventually moved to the USC 20, setting up Maldonado’s attempt. But it was clearly wide as soon as it was kicked, sparking complete bedlam on the Trojan sideline.
The crowd: Autzen Stadium is legendary for its crowd noise, and Saturday was no exception. Despite forcing just one false start by the Trojan offensive line, the 60,000 Oregon faithful in attendance (minus a couple thousand USC fans) were yelling full bore most of the game, and were particularly rowdy as the Ducks mounted their comeback. But following Maldonado’s miss, it was dead silent. Many stayed for sat in their seats for several minutes after the game, perhaps unsure of how to react following Oregon’s first home loss since 2007.
“’SC is back!”: Those were the cries heard on the field by many of the players after the game. Most called it the most exciting win of their careers, including those (such as Barkley) who made the trip to Ohio State in 2009. Said safety T.J. McDonald, “We’ll go into any stadium, anywhere, and play anybody. People sometimes forget: This is SC.”
Up next: Another “need it be explained situation.” The Victory Bell is on the line as the now No. 10 Trojans host UCLA. It will be Kiffin’s first time as head coach against the Bruins in the Coliseum, and USC has a chance to win 10 games and secure their spot in the top-10 in the AP poll. USC has already clinched the Pac-12 south title, but because of their bowl ban cannot compete in the Conference Championship game. A UCLA upset victory would clinch second place in the south—and the right to represent the division in the Conference Championship game—to the Bruins.
