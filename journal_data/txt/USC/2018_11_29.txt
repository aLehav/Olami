A man was fatally struck by an LA Metro train at the Exposition/Vermont Station Thursday night, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The pedestrian was hit by a train that was heading toward downtown Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed. A University spokesperson said that the accident was not USC affiliated.
“The train was traveling eastbound on Exposition approaching Vermont when a pedestrian male, Hispanic, 40-year-old walked north-bound across Exposition Boulevard outside of the cross-walk toward the platform,” a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson said. “The pedestrian possibly slipped and was struck by the train and pronounced dead at the scene.”
Metro spokesperson Brian Haas said the man was hit while crossing the Expo Line at 5:38 p.m. The victim crossed at a point in the tracks where pedestrians are advised not to, Haas said.
Metro and LAPD have sectioned off the 1000 block of Vermont Avenue for the investigation. 
According to LAFD, the train operator was taken to a nearby hospital after the accident. No other injuries were reported.
The incident caused a near 20-minute delay on the Expo Line Thursday evening. Trains are sharing one track.

The NFL is never going to give a crap about domestic violence.
This is something I’ve been resigned to for a while, just another reason to resent this league and this sport as football continues to become less fun and more dirty. Of course, there’s countless institutions in the country that don’t really care about women — just look at the way victims of sexual assault and violence are pushed aside in national narratives on a weekly basis.
So it’s not surprising that the NFL — an organization which claimed that football didn’t cause concussions, that openly muzzles its own players to avoid stepping into the spotlight — would similarly ignore the plight of the women its players abuse. 
This week was yet another reminder of that stark truth, as linebacker Reuben Foster spent less than 48 hours unemployed after he was arrested for domestic violence and released by the San Francisco 49ers.
It wasn’t Foster’s first offense, or his second. It’s his second arrest for domestic violence, and his third total arrest in 2018 alone. Yet somehow, the Washington Redskins decided that despite all of these moral and legal faults, Foster’s ability to rush the passer and elude blockers is somehow worth employment. He was picked up off the waiver wire and given a new position on a new team, a weekly place in the national spotlight and a fat paycheck to boot.
The thing about this league is that it’s made rules that are, at the very least, a step in the right direction. According to the NFL player’s handbook, a first-time offense of domestic violence should be met with a minimum six-week suspension. That would seem like a reasonable punishment to fit a crime — perhaps a bit lenient, but at least a somewhat hefty amount of time to sit on the sidelines — if it was ever actually used.
But that’s simply not the case. This rule has only been enforced a handful of times in its history, most noticeably on Ezekiel Elliott in 2016. Despite the multitudes of allegations, settlements and cases won against NFL players each season, it’s rare to see a team choose to enforce preexisting rules and guidelines.
This, of course, is ironic at  best and damning at worst when considering the frequency with which the NFL and its teams enforce other rules about athlete conduct. The league doles out plenty of suspensions and fines for a multitude of infractions — insider trading, drug use, over-inflating balls. 
Chicago linebacker Jerrell Freeman, for instance, has been suspended for over 30 games for using performance enhancing drugs. That suspension is eight times as harsh as the one that Baltimore cornerback Jimmy Smith received after his former girlfriend alleged that he physically abused her during a custody dispute.
So what’s the difference? Why does the NFL waver between strict enforcement and lax ignorance?
In dealing with these issues, the NFL finds a route to cop out by increasing its strictness in incidents that directly involve the game of football. PEDs, taunting, spearing, targeting — these rules all have to do with the actual game between the lines. They are easy to enforce because they’re out in the open constantly, directly visible for fans to see every Sunday (and Thursday and Monday). 
But domestic violence is something that happens in the shadows. It’s not broadcasted on television and it doesn’t dominate headlines. When it comes to football, reporters and broadcast hosts are more likely to talk about statistics and spreads than the brutal off-the-field behavior of its stars. Domestic violence is easy to hide for the NFL because everyone outside of the league — fans and reporters alike — are willing to quickly forget it. 
The burden, then, now rests on us, the fans and the media. It shouldn’t be on us. It should be on the league, the teams, the coaches and, ultimately, the men who are committing these crimes. But the football community as a whole must choose to become enforcers when it comes to domestic violence. If the NFL won’t do it on its own, then so be it. But the fans and the media must come together to refuse to forget the violence inflicted on these women.
On Sunday, Reuben Foster might lace up his cleats and take the field and become a star. He could become another body in a helmet and a jersey who young fans look up to as a role model, an inspiration, despite the violence in his past. 
When it comes to football, this is a pattern we have expected too many times, for much too long. At some point, it has to stop. Why not now?

The men’s basketball team hung on for its third consecutive win with a 75-65 victory over Long Beach State at the Galen Center on Wednesday.
Redshirt junior Derryck Thornton made his return after missing the past two games, adding much needed depth to the Trojans’ backcourt while star freshman Kevin Porter Jr. remains sidelined. 
Long Beach State did not shoot the ball well, but its shifty guards pressured the USC defense and drew fouls, an issue that has plagued USC early on in the season. Even without senior guard Deishaun Booker, who averages a team-high 16 points, the 49ers’ impressive 12-deep rotation kept them competitive all night long. 
Thornton gave USC a spark early on with 7 points and four assists in the opening half, yet the Trojans continued their string of slow starts, trailing 9-6 after several minutes of play. 
Freshman point guard Elijah Weaver, who came off the bench after starting last game, continued his confident play, hitting two triples and sparking the team a quick 7-0 run that helped them take a 36-28 lead at the half. 
USC used LBSU’s greatest strength — crafty dribble penetration — against them, as Thornton and Weaver got to the lane with ease to create spot up shots for their teammates and allowing six Trojans to hit 3-pointers in the half. Weaver easily slid over to the two with his 6-foot-5 frame as Thornton ran point, something that Thornton hopes they will continue to do moving forward.
“He’s a great player, super good,” Thornton said of Weaver. “He just has a good feel for the game. It definitely makes it easier having two point guards on the floor on the same time.” 
USC continued its unselfish play and hot shooting into the second half, pushing the ball down the floor and showcasing its superior athleticism. However, Long Beach State would not go down easily. They slowed the pace of the game down, out-rebounding USC 47-45 and capitalizing on careless turnovers for easy buckets. 
Guard Jordan Roberts stepped up in Booker’s absence, outscoring USC’s bench on his own with a career-high 13 points. Head coach Andy Enfield made an aggressive in-game adjustment, switching to a full court press in hopes of rattling the 49ers, but the tactic was easily broken down. The Trojans were forced to switch back to a zone, something they have not done as much this year.
“Our man-to-man defense has been pretty good most of the season,” Enfield said. “We’re holding teams to about 37 percent from the field. We’re getting better defensively. Last year, our zone was terrific. This year, because we’ve had so many injuries, our zone is not as good as it has been.”
Junior forward Nick Rakocevic heated up down the stretch, showing confidence in calling for the ball when he got to his spot on the block. He showed off a smooth hook numerous times. He finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
“Nick’s done a good job of improving every year,” Enfield said. “He knows what it takes to win. He’s got very good touch around the basket. He certainly is our best rebounder and shot blocker and he intends to keep developing on both sides of the ball.”
Rakocevic credited his improved play to the time he put in this past offseason. 
“I was working hard all summer,” Rakocevic said. “Stayed here, didn’t go home, [working on] just every aspect of my game. Just being here, working with the coaches.”
The Trojans still shot 50 percent from 3-pointer, despite not getting many open looks.
“We have some very good shooters,” Enfield said. “When their feet are set and they’re open. That’s the big thing for us, we want to take open shots, and tonight we didn’t have a ton of open shots from 3.”
USC closed the game on a 7-0 run to pull away with the 10-point win. 
USC was quite fortunate that the 49ers struggled to put the ball in the hoop, as it only shot 36 percent, despite having numerous good looks. 
Enfield stressed the importance of increasing the defensive intensity moving forward, especially against No. 5 Nevada on Saturday. 
“The biggest thing is rebounding,” Enfield said. “We play small a lot. It’s one of those things where the guards have to come back in and help.” 
USC will take on Nevada on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Galen Center.

With 0.1 seconds left on the clock, Fresno State put up a shot to win at the buzzer, only for it to not count, sealing the game for the Trojans. Fresno State had control of the lead most of the game, leading nearly 27 minutes, but it was the women’s basketball team that prevailed when all said was done. The Trojans won 62-61 to extend their record to a perfect 7-0. 
“[Fresno State] did a great job, they practiced hard,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We were lucky to win, but a win’s a win so we’re happy.”
The Bulldogs had the advantage in almost every category in the first quarter, with 12 points in the paint, two steals and four assists. The Trojans got off to a fast start, but it did not last long, as the Bulldogs went on a 23-8 run to finish the first quarter up by 8. The biggest difference in the first quarter was turnovers, as the Bulldogs only had three compared to the Trojans seven. 
“We had problems with [Fresno State’s] dribble drive offense; they cut hard, and they did a good job… really compliment their play today,” Trakh said.
The Bulldogs had all the momentum, but the Trojans were slowly making their way back into the game. With just under four minutes in the second quarter, redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron hit a 3-pointer to give the Trojans their first lead of the game since early in the first quarter. The rest of the first half was a back-and-forth affair, as the Bulldogs took a late lead going into the half on two free throws from senior Candice White. 
Entering the second half the Trojans, needed to find a way to take back the lead. The Bulldogs kept up with the Trojans, however, responding with a lay-up or 3-pointer every time USC scored. The third quarter produced equal stats among both teams. USC had 21 points, while Fresno State had 20. Senior guard Mariya Moore had a strong third quarter with 8 points.
USC was down by 1 as the fourth quarter started. In the closest game of the season, the Trojans did what they do best: capitalize and finish. With under 10 seconds to go in the game, down by 1, Mariya Moore dribbled into the paint and pulled up and made the game-winning jumper.
“There were like three other times we were in that situation and I couldn’t finish,” Mariya Moore said, ‘so on that final play as soon as I came off that screen, I felt that guard behind me and I saw that there was enough space behind me and the post so I shot it.”
USC finished with 34 rebounds, 14 assists and netted six 3-pointers. Minyon Moore led all players in points and rebounds with 7 and seven, respectively. 
“We got some work to do, but overall these are games you could win or lose,” Trakh said. “I’m really proud of the kids, they didn’t stop attacking.”
The Women of Troy travel to Nevada this Saturday to take on UNLV.

Josh Dunst | Daily Trojan
The men’s water polo team managed to earn the No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament in Palo Alto this weekend in their 14th consecutive trip to the tournament. The seeding is a testament to their 28-3 season, despite two consecutive losses in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament two weeks ago. 
In the tournament, USC is looking to conquer its 10th national championship at Stanford’s Avery Aquatic Center. The Trojans earned a first round bye, and their first match will be in the semifinals against the winner of the UCLA-George Washington quarterfinal. 
Stanford will also play in the semifinal round of the tournament, facing the winner of the UC San Diego vs. Long Beach State quarterfinal match. 
Sophomore driver Marko Vavic said the team is anticipating a matchup against UCLA.
“We’ve just been studying [UCLA} a lot, preparing for their weaknesses in their games and how to take advantage so that we can make it to the finals,” Vavic said. 
The Trojans have scouted Bruins’ freshman attacker Ashworth Molthen and sophomore attacker Nicolas Saveljic, who Vavic said is a “great shooter.”  
After a disappointing 4-7 loss to the Bruins in the MPSF tournament, the Trojans are learning from their downfalls to prepare for Saturday. The team is working on being more organized and cleaning up their counter attacks. 
“We get a lot of advantages that we don’t capitalize on the way we should,” Vavic said.
Freshman goalie Nic Porter adds that the team was not happy with their offense in the MPSF tournament. 
“Particularly against UCLA, only scoring 4 goals, we were pretty unlucky on defense a few times but they’re situations where if we are on our game a bit more, watching the ball, anticipating what’s going to happen then we can stop them,” Porter said. 
Against both Cal and UCLA, the Trojans started the games well. In the Cal match, the team built a 9-6 lead in the first three quarters but the Bears came back and won, 10-9
The next day versus UCLA, the Trojans were able to keep the Bruins quiet for a whole quarter, posting a 1-0 lead at the end of the first period. The key for USC heading into the NCAA tournament is to see its solid opening performance through the full game. 
Both Vavic and Porter agree that team chemistry is the biggest thing the team has improved on over the course of the season. Especially since over half the team was replaced from last season.
“The coaching staff has been able to integrate us all together and we’re playing some good water polo,” Vavic said. “Everyone is great mates out of the water as well, which is important for success. Full credit to the coaching staff for bringing in a good group of players and getting [them] to play well together.” 
The Trojans enter the NCAA tournament confident, despite the nerves of the high pressure situation. 
“Personally, I don’t really get too nervous, I get energetic,” Vavic said. “But I think the hardest thing whether you get nervous or whether you get excited, is to stay focused on the moment because in big games like this, the game is so short that opportunities pass you by so quickly.
Porter echoed what Vavic said. 
“We’re so well prepared for these games that naturally there are going to be some nerves there but we’re so confident in the game plan that we have and the players that we have,” Porter said. “Once the game gets started, you’re in the zone and you need to do your job. For us that means getting this national championship.” 
The Trojans semifinal game will be played at 5 p.m. Saturday. The championship game is slated for 3 p.m. Sunday. Both matches will be hosted by Stanford at Avery Aquatic Center in Palo Alto and will be streamed on NCAA Live.

A team of workers pick trash under the seats after a double-header weekend of games at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Oct. 29. (Eric He | Daily Trojan)
It’s Saturday night, minutes before USC’s game against Colorado at the Coliseum, and the stadium is abuzz. Thousands of students and fans stream onto the concourse, talking, laughing and buying drinks — enjoying everything gameday has to offer.
Somewhere in the swarm is Joshua Sierra, who works as a program specialist in the USC Office of Sustainability. He helps oversee the Zero Waste program at the Coliseum, an initiative launched in 2015 to reduce waste at the historic stadium, which hosted nearly one million fans between USC and Los Angeles Rams football games in 2017.
Sierra is not here to party.
Holding a notepad with a pen tucked behind his ear, he slowly makes his way around the stadium, performing audits on vendors to ensure they adhere to zero-waste regulations — using compostable containers, wrappers and service ware. He examines napkins, cups and straws, making a note of anything that doesn’t look compostable. He’ll then talk to the vendor and confirm they’ll swap out the material next week.
“If they’ve been good the past couple of weeks, I’m not going to rip through everything,” Sierra said. “You can just watch for one second and see what that they’re serving. I’m not going to Sherlock Holmes them.”
With the program in its fourth season, vendors know the drill. They know to use compostable materials — and they are happy to participate in conservation efforts. 
 “A lot of them are proud, like, ‘Hey, check out what we did,’” Sierra said of the vendors. 
Vendors are just one facet of the large puzzle that is the Zero Waste program: It’s a program that has become necessary for the Coliseum, where this season, fans have generated more than 10 tons of waste per game, according to the Office of Sustainability. 
During the Colorado game on Nov. 13, attended by over 50,000 fans — the most recent game for which data is available — 16.3 of 17.8 tons of waste were diverted from landfill. Additionally, almost seven tons of recycling and over nine tons of compost were diverted.
Brian Grant, the Senior Associate Director of Facilities & Project Management of operations at the Coliseum, helped start the Zero Waste initiative along with Jeff Farrell, the Coliseum Facility Operations Manager. 
After heading operations at TCF Bank Stadium — home of the University of Minnesota football team — which also has a zero waste program, Grant and his team decided to try it in Los Angeles. But while TCF Bank Stadium opened in 2009, the Coliseum is 86 years older and holds about 28,000 more seats. 
Despite these obstacles, Grant knew he could make it happen. And numbers indicate that achieving zero waste is possible, even at the Coliseum. In 2017, it became the largest NFL stadium and second largest college stadium to achieve “zero waste,” by recycling, repurposing or composting 90 percent of its waste. 
“We knew we were taking a bigger leap,” Grant said. “We wanted to get to the end game. It was a point of pride to be able to do this kind of thing.”

A 200-person task 
This season, the Coliseum has achieved zero waste in two out of three USC games in which data was made available. It diverted 90 percent of waste in the season opener against UNLV and 91 percent against Colorado, which was the “Green Game” in the Pac-12’s annual Zero Waste Competition.
Last year USC won the competition after diverting 90.96 percent of gameday waste during an October game. It topped itself this year, recording a 91.38 percent diversion rate in the Colorado game.
“The Coliseum waste diversion is incredibly efficient because you’ve got organized vendors and organized maintenance people,” said Esther Margulies, an associate professor at the USC School of Architecture.
The clean-up process takes a team effort among 200 staff members. It happens in three waves, according to Grant, with a crew systematically working through each section of the stadium to first bag recyclable items, then compostable materials and finally any remaining waste.
Then, in the “post-trash” phase, a group of sorters in the compost — a small area near Gate 14 with two sorting tables and four compactors — work in shifts to separate out trash, recyclable and compostable items before they are sent to the facility. This is an important step in the sustainability process, one that Guillermo Parra, compost supervisor for Marsden West — the contractor that serves the Coliseum — takes pride in.
“To be working in trash, you’ve got to be a little crazy,” Parra said. “Detail-oriented: that’s one of my things. I like the process of separating and then helping the environment.”
Donning a full uniform and hard hat, Parra excitedly explains each part of the sorting process, introducing his employees and describing the function of all the materials in the compost.
Despite the unpleasant sound of bottles being squeezed and the smell of garbage filling the air, it’s a loose environment. Music blasts. Employees crack jokes.
“It’s very peaceful,” Jaime Escobar said as he sorted through a pile of trash, a big smile spreading across his face. “The people here are very friendly, helpful. The supervisors don’t push you, don’t stress you. We know that we have to get things out at a certain time, but I enjoy it.”
Ideally, the crew would have all week. But with USC and the Rams sharing a facility, there’s the unavoidable scenario of consecutive games in a weekend. On this particular Monday, the Coliseum just hosted what Ellen Dux, programs manager at the Office of Sustainability, called the “weekend of hell” — USC played Arizona State on a Saturday, and the Rams faced the Packers on Sunday.
With a short turnaround, Grant had a crew cleaning up immediately after the USC game ended. Trash bags line the area outside the tunnels leading to the seats. There’s a slide draped over the stairs so workers don’t have to carry heavy bags of trash down the steps. Efficiency rules the day.
“Our window is more like hours instead of days,” Grant said.
Grant remembers the weekend last season when USC beat Texas in a game that went to double overtime on a Saturday night, followed by the Rams hosting a game the following Sunday at 1:25 p.m. The crew stayed at the Coliseum for 39 straight hours, and it was then that Grant realized how insane the job is.
“As crazy as it sounds to say that we did two games in 24 hours, everybody takes an immense amount of pride afterwards, realizing that what we pulled off here is pretty cool,” Grant said. “It takes a lot of effort, and it’s really draining physically, emotionally.”
Outside the Coliseum
There’s a running joke in the athletic fields and irrigation supervisor’s family: He goes to bed before his 1-year-old granddaughter.
“Between 7:30 [p.m.] and 8 [p.m.], I’m usually out,” Steve Dugas said. “When you’re up at 3, you just don’t have that stamina at the end of the day.”
Dugas manages the University’s 10 outdoor sports facilities, which include Dedeaux Field, McAlister Field and Merle Norman Stadium. He and his crew of eight arrive early in the morning to avoid disturbing students.
“There’s a lot of cleaning that needs to take place in public areas,” Dugas said.
The team attempts to work on each facility daily, but its work is dependent on what attention and repairs are needed, whether it’s picking up trash, blowing an area or washing something down. The only “routine” is a 5 a.m. staff meeting to discuss the day’s events.
 There is a large whiteboard calendar in a meeting room adjacent to Dugas’ windowless office next to Dedeaux Field, filled to the brim with USC’s athletics schedule. In addition to making sure competition fields are ready prior to gameday and conducting post-event cleanup and maintenance, the crew is responsible for staffing all baseball games.
“There is no such thing as a typical day,” Dugas said. “The only thing typical is that we all meet in the morning. After that, we could be all over the place, depending on the sport that’s in season.”
The campus irrigation system uses weather-based programming, making adjustments based on daily evaporation statistics to save as much water as possible in a drought-prone state. 
According to Eric Johnson, director of operations at Facilities Management and Services at USC, about 70 percent of the sprayhead sprinklers used on the athletics facilities have been replaced by drip irrigation, which allows water to drip directly where needed, eliminating runoff. This reduces water usage significantly: from 2-4 gallons a minute with a sprayhead to 0.9 gallons an hour with drip irrigation, Johnson said.
That is, when squirrels aren’t chewing on the irrigation lines. Dugas said squirrels are one of the biggest problems his crew faces daily.
“Even if the system is not on, they’ll chew on the lines to get water out of it,” Dugas said. “It creates a lot of work for the guys.”
Johnson’s said workers try to avoid using chemicals such as pesticides or insecticides.  
“What they do is all about how you apply water, applying it correctly and efficiently, growing grass, growing plants, growing trees,” Johnson said. “It’s all about sustainability.”
Dugas is also aware of the pressures of maintaining facilities at a school with a prestigious athletics program, and balancing sustainability practices with ensuring a sleek appearance.
“When they have a prospective recruit coming to campus on a campus visit, they want to be able to show off their facilities,” Dugas said. “We get how important that is.”
Educating fans
As kickoff for the Nov. 10 homecoming game creeps closer, tailgating on campus reaches its peak at dusk. It is a night game, and fans have had plenty of time to get tipsy. Multiple rowdy games of beer pong break out on the McCarthy Quad lawn. Next to one faceoff, a crowd forms around a man performing a keg stand.  
About 20 yards away sits a tent with a green sign that reads “Trojans Recycle Right.” 
Two cornholes sets sit next to the sign, listing the differences between landfill and recyclable items. This is the temporary headquarters of Team Trash Talkers, a group of around 20 students hired by the Office of Sustainability to assist in limiting tailgate waste.
This is the first year of the initiative, which Dux described as the “least of the low-hanging fruit.” 
Last year, there were no recycling bins provided at tailgates. That’s changed this year, and during the tailgate before the Arizona State game on Oct. 27, five tons of waste were recycled.
 The program is a still a work in progress. Without a lot of data, the team is testing out various strategies toward engaging with tailgaters. The night before home games, the group places recycling decals on bins. The decals serve as a segue for the group to talk to people about engagement, according to Temoc Chavero, the student leader of Team Trash Talkers.
 “Half of our part is decaling, the other half is engagement,” said Chavero, a junior majoring in business administration. “So we walk around, talk to people. We hand out cards, surveys … Anything to get people to have a conversation about waste diversion.”
For this tailgate, the team is employing a strategy called “waste goalies,” in which team members pair up, stand next to several bins and remind tailgaters which products are recyclable and which are compostable.  
“It’s near-perfect waste diversion,” Chavero said. 
Yet the group can only do so much. Much like waste diversion at the Coliseum, the impetus is on fans to understand the importance of sustainability and toss their waste items into the correct bins. That can be difficult with fans just trying to have a good time at a tailgate or a game.
 “Our big goal needs to be bringing general public tailgating up to the level of responsibility of what happens inside,” said Margulies, who is also a member of the USC Academic Senate Sustainability Committee.
“Education is part of sustainability,” Marguiles said. “It might change behavior in a positive way.” 
Positive education is what Team Trash Talkers strives to put forward. But the group still has to face the reality that many people don’t understand the impact recycling can have. 
“It’s hard,” Chavero said, “because you get all these drunk people and they don’t want to talk.” 
It’s why this week, the group backed off of McCarthy Quad, sending people to locations such as the areas around Tommy Trojan, Fertitta Hall, Pardee Tower and Trousdale Parkway. 
The quad is too crowded, too noisy, too rowdy to control the waste stream for the tailgate. The goal is not to simply show face as the sustainability group, but to fill up the recycling bins to divert more waste.
“That’s the bottom line,” Dux said. “Everyone likes a good show and a good party, but if that doesn’t get at what we’re doing, then why are we really doing it?”

USC’s student-run arts magazine Palaver published its fourth issue this month, marking its second full year of publication after a seven year hiatus.
Amy Cannon, the Palaver faculty advisor and a Thematic Option lecturer, helped to reboot the magazine in Spring of 2017 with TO Executive Director Richard Edinger . It previously ran from 1998 to Fall 2010, and ceased publication because of its editor turnover rate, which made Palaver difficult to maintain, according to Cannon.
“When I was hired on at Thematic Option, they … wanted to draw on the fact that I had an MFA in creative writing,” Cannon said. “Along with teaching responsibilities, [faculty gives] service to the University … not explicitly tied to teaching, but are still enriching student experience in some way.”
The weekly TO newsletter sent out a call for editors, and Cannon brought together a team of eight students of different majors both within and outside of TO to restart the publication. These students formed the Palaver editing team, and began accepting submissions for online publication. Their first issue was titled “Ways To Break A Heart,” and featured a variety of poems, videos and other artworks.
Palaver’s emphasis is on the variety of voices, stories and forms that can interact together to form a complete publication.
“I want there to be a multiplicity of voices and perspectives and opportunities for students to share, even if they’re not an English major, or even if they’re not an art major, but [if] this is something that they feel drawn toward,” Cannon said.
Many students who aren’t academically focused on art forms they are passionate about have turned to Palaver as a place to explore the arts. The newest editor to the team, Poetry co-Editor Elizabeth Dassow, joined the team in Spring 2018. Since her academic interests were different, the sophomore majoring in law, history and culture and art history, found it difficult to integrate poetry into her life. 
“Since my majors don’t really foster my love for creative writing and everything like that, [Palaver] gave me an outlet to be in the creative world, in the creative process, doing what I really love, and it’s given me an outlet when school just isn’t enough,” Dassow said.
Palaver encourages cross-artistic discussion and features four genres of art — poetry, prose, media and art.
“The reason that we do this, the reason why it is online and we have so many genres is because we’re really dedicated to starting a conversation between all the arts,” said Jordan Kessler, a media co-editor and a junior majoring in theatre. “That’s why each semester, our launch event is our most exciting piece, we get to get all of our artists in a room talking about all their works — you have poets asking graphic designers questions and relating.”
Palaver is different from other previous student art magazines, like USC Keck School of Medicine’s publication Synesthesia or the student-run literary magazine Adsum, in the variety of work it accepts and its very recent resurrection. Kessler said that this past issue had seen submissions as unique as a three-dimensional printed model and a comic book.
“The cool thing about being online, and also being so new, is that each issue can be unique — we’re not tied to any specific structure,” Kessler said.
Matthew Fresolone, a media co-editor and senior majoring in film and television production, is glad Palaver gives voice to students who want to share their talent and ideas, especially if they aren’t very outgoing or looking to pursue their art form professionally.
“I’m usually pretty shy about putting myself out there, especially with university clubs, and I really like that about Palaver,” Fresolone said. “Not just me being involved, but other people who all show up, who love to make things, but they’re all really shy themselves, so we love getting them to events, making them feel comfortable about talking about stuff that they probably don’t outside.”

USC Chief Information Security Officer Gus Anagnos sent an email to the USC community Wednesday informing students that they will need to create a new passphrase the when they change their USC NetID passwords starting Nov. 30. 
The NetID password is the credential used to access several online tools including MyUSC, Blackboard, Google Apps at USC and the secure wireless network. The change affects anyone with access to the USC NetID system, particularly students, faculty and staff. 
The security change has been discussed, developed and pilot tested over the past 18 months, according to Anagnos. 
“This change is part of the University’s ongoing efforts to protect your USC accounts and university systems from hacking attempts,” the email read.
Anagnos said passphrases enhance user experience by making login credentials easier to remember and fostering a standardized password policy across multiple systems. 
Passphrases typically comprise a phrase, sentence or series of words and are less restrictive in character requirements, Anagnos said. Students will no longer have to include a combination of capital and lowercase letters or letters and numbers. Passphrases are required to be 16 to 64 characters long.
“There’s research out there saying that passphrases are more secure than the passwords of the past,” Anagnos said. “Passphrases are the modern way to do it.”
However, there are two new restrictions on the passphrase: It may not include the user’s USC NetID username and may not reuse their USC NetID password or phrase. 
So far, the change has garnered mixed reactions. Anagnos said he has received emails from people who are enthusiastic about the change as well as people asking why it was necessary. He believes that those who oppose it may lack an understanding and awareness of its benefits. 
“Overall, my expectation is that it’s going to be received well because for the user it’s actually going to put them in a better position than the old policy,” Anagnos said. 
IT Services encourages students to create a new, strong and unique passphrase as soon as possible.

Katherine Guevara, a Center for Excellence in Teaching Instructional Designer at USC, developed an app at the beginning of the semester with a team of students called Mobile Teacher to provide a platform for educators to share effective teaching methods in regions without internet connection.
The Android app, which has received a grant from the U.S. State Department, has been in development since the beginning of the semester when three Viterbi School of Engineering students selected Guevara’s idea as their Capstone Project. 
Guevara said that her time working with the U.S. Peace Corps and the time she spent as an English language fellow in Ecuador inspired her to create the app.
“When I was working in Ecuador, I did a TV English program that reached over a million people,” Guevara said. “That’s when I realized there’s a potential for technology to scale teacher training.”
The purpose of the app is to localize expertise, providing a platform for people in developing countries to share what teaching practices worked for them with other teachers. The app will have short videos submitted by teachers in different areas that will be accessible to users. Content will be searchable by country, subject and language.
“Wouldn’t it be nice to see someone that looks like you teaching in a context that looks like yours, and recognize that person as an expert?” Guevara asked. “That’s just not happening right now, but there’s no reason why it shouldn’t.” 
While people from developing countries have access to phones, internet connection can sometimes be unreliable, Guevara said. This app works offline with Youtube Go, another app that allows viewing and sharing of videos without WiFi.
Veronica Perry, who works as a social media volunteer to manage the app’s online presence, said the app can help combine passion for education and teaching programs and access. 
“This app serves as a point of connection in a community where people can come together and share ideas,” Perry said. “It brings together all of these individuals who don’t necessarily have the same access that we do, but they have the same passion for education and the same drive to inspire and to educate their community.” 
Along with the app, Guevara also designed a scoreboard of best practices for potential technology developers who are considering creating a similar program. The scoreboard acts as a checklist to ensure that the app is accessible to people who are in areas of low internet connectivity.
Timothy Malaney, a member of the computer science team, said that designing the app was both exciting and challenging, since he previously had designed mainly intuitively or aesthetically.
“Designing and developing for accessibility was interesting in lots of ways,” Malaney said. “We had to restrict our user interfaces to using few images and simple user flows.” 
The team recently received the first submission for the app from a teacher in Peru. 
“[The U.S. Peace corps has] contact with teachers where they are assigned at their sites,” Guevara said. “They are encouraging their local counterparts to submit videos.” 
From here, Guevara plans to pitch a second phase, which would feature language translation features and more texting capabilities as a project for computer science professor Jeffrey Miller’s class in Spring semester.
“We’re hoping that over the course of the next few months, the app builds a following of enthusiastic users who can help spread the word about Mobile Teacher to their local communities,” Malaney said.

The USC Thematic Option Honors Program and Joint Educational Project announced a new interdisciplinary, service learning course for Spring 2019 that encourages students to find solutions for social issues.
Juniors and seniors can apply to the Frameworks for Interdisciplinary Exchange program, which will offer courses focused on homelessness in Los Angeles.
Richard Edinger, executive director of Dornsife Honors programs, has worked on creating the FIX program for several years. He said he hopes the interdisciplinary program will bring together students of all different majors to discuss and find real solutions to issues like homelessness.
“There’s no one field that’s going to solve homelessness in the world or in the U.S. or in L.A.,” Edinger said. “It’s really going to be a combination of someone understanding the politics, the legal issues, someone thinking it through from a design fashion, maybe something from an architectural perspective … All these things have to come together to really understand an issue like homelessness.”
Edinger said students in the FIX program next semester can choose between one of three single unit Focused Fixes courses in Social Entrepreneurship, Religious Communities or Philanthropy and Nonprofits to explore how these institutions and communities address homelessness. All students also take Collaborative Fixes, a three-unit interdisciplinary course where students will learn about and discuss possible solutions for homelessness in L.A., according to him.
In the future, Edinger said this course framework could be used to examine other topics like sustainability, public education and incarceration.
Adlai Wertman, professor of social entrepreneurship, will be teaching the single unit course focused on social entrepreneurship. He said he plans to teach students about how for profit and nonprofit enterprises are addressing homelessness and have students meet representatives from these organizations.
“The idea is to talk about the theory, how social enterprise addresses it, talk about specific examples and then either visit or be visited by people who run those agencies so that we can ask them questions and hear from them themselves,” Wertman said.
Sable Manson, assistant director for student leadership and development at JEP, said students will also complete a service project with some of JEP’s community partner organizations that address homelessness such as Midnight Mission, Chrysalis and School on Wheels. She said the FIX program will benefit students by teaching them about issues like homelessness both inside and outside of the classroom.
“We are in a very diverse city, and we actually benefit our students to go beyond book learning,” Manson said. “We really value experiential learning because we think, not that it’s better than others, but it really deepens what you’ve experienced in a book or you’ve experienced in a classroom.”
By the end of the semester, Edinger said students will use their coursework, discussions and volunteer experiences to create proposals on how to address homelessness, like creating programs or fundraising opportunities. He hopes that students will be able to present these proposals to stakeholders from USC, the city government and local organizations who could work with students to make their ideas a reality.
“We don’t want it to be just conversations that stay within the classroom and then never actually affect change,” Edinger said. “We want to help students see how the knowledge they gain at USC connects to things outside of the University.”

Most faculty and students don’t get to see a beautiful ocean sunrise or a pod of dolphins on their commute to class. But for researchers at USC’s environmental research center on Catalina Island, it’s all part of an average day. 
A 5 a.m. wake-up call to beat traffic on the 110 Freeway and 90 minutes on turbulent waters separate staff and students from the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina. USC’s personal shuttle on the sea, the Miss Christi, takes visitors through the roughly 25 nautical miles from the port of San Pedro to the research center at least five days a week.
The Wrigley Marine Science Center was founded by Philip Wrigley, son of chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. and a dedicated environmentalist who donated his family’s land on Catalina Island for conservation. The USC Wrigley Institute opened as an extension of the Marine Science Center in 1995, as a dedicated space for research in sustainable initiatives. Since then, the island has been a model for implementation of sustainable practices and a hotbed for environmental research.
Some notable projects hosted on Catalina include a large-scale measurement of metal contamination in Southern California’s coastal waters, monitoring the effects of light pollution on coastal marine animals, exploring the evolution of the endangered island fox and ongoing research in food sustainability — from aquaponics gardening to revolutionary methods of composting with the help of black soldier flies. 
Diane Kim, associate director of the Wrigley Institute, is working on a project to convert kelp into a biofuel that could someday replace gasoline.
“It’s pretty straightforward … and I think there’s a lot of power in that, that a lot of really innovative solutions are also simple ones,” Kim said. 
Kelp, a species of macroalgae,  is turned into a biofuel through  a process called hydrothermal liquefaction. This involves drying the kelp, then processing the biomass in an extremely hot, pressurized and wet environment for long periods of time to allow the breakdown of the solid chemical structure. Typically, the product of this process is a biocrude, which can be further distilled or processed into a fuel that can be used just like any petroleum-based fuel. 
Kim and her colleagues, a team of faculty, undergraduate and graduate researchers from USC, as well as partners at eco-tech company Marine BioEnergy, have been working on the kelp project for about two years now. The key to their work is cooperation, involving specialists such as chemical engineers from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and business analysts from Marine BioEnergy who are looking into the future commercialization of kelp as a biofuel.
First-year graduate students Rilee Sanders and Tristan Jordan-Huffman have been working on the project as field research assistants. The pair spent the past summer out on the island doing two to three dives per day to monitor juvenile kelp plants and determine the optimal timing for stationing the kelp in the ocean.
In other countries, researchers have already been looking into kelp as a biofuel source for the last few years. However, the researchers at Wrigley and Marine BioEnergy have come up with an innovative way to farm the massive amounts of kelp necessary for a commercialized fuel source: a so-called “kelp elevator.” The current prototype models use PVC pipes in the ocean to grow the kelp. The pipes also cycle them from the surface where the light is to the deep water where the nutrients are.
“We’re talking about areas almost the size of the United States in total, so you need a lot of space to do that,” Kim said.
The solution is to go out into the open ocean, away from the coast, which humans already heavily rely on for resources and recreation. 
“Instead of taking the nutrients to the kelp, we’re taking the kelp to the nutrients,” Kim said, adding that the toughest part is working against the currents. 
Eventually, the team hopes the growing model will be much more technologically advanced.

“We don’t want to battle the ocean, we want to go with the flow literally, so we want this free-floating autonomous farm that’s pulled by drones that are powered by solar,” Kim said.
It sounds like a Jetsons-esque utopia, but this could be the reality of a future without fossil fuels. Kelp is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet, according to Sanders. And unlike traditionally farmed plants, it requires no fresh water, fertilizer, pesticides or fertile land. These attributes make kelp a viable potential substitute for traditional fuels, as it can be sustainably farmed, harvested and converted into biofuel.
The USC Wrigley Institute’s research is part of a larger effort to get the United States’ biofuel production caught up to the rest of the world. Other countries like Sweden and Japan have been farming kelp in large quantities for decades taking advantage of the crop’s nutritional benefits in their regular diet. Thus, they already have a working kelp-farming infrastructure to use and develop.
But the faculty and students working on the project are optimistic that they can overcome these early hurdles and revolutionize the fuel industry.
“If we can not only prove that it can be done, but that it can be done efficiently and in a competitive way with other biofuels then it really has the potential to be a leading factor in the industry,” Jordan-Huffman said. 
Kim stressed that the team is not focused on profit, but rather commercial viability in a competitive fuel market.
“The Wrigley Institute supports any project that is looking for sustainable solutions to some of our biggest environmental challenges, and energy is certainly one of those,” Kim said. 
Sanders has faith in his colleagues. He noted the importance of having dedicated researchers in specific areas — including ocean conservation, chemical engineering and economics — so that they can become experts on these relatively new scientific developments. 
“What we’re attempting to do … is really transformative for the future in terms of biofuel usage and just the possibilities that exist when you put smart people together and figure some things out,” Sanders said.

Community organizers rally on 23rd Street to prevent AllenCo from reopening at a public protest on Sept. 8. (Diana Kruzman | Daily Trojan)
It started with a smell.
Most nights around 1 a.m., Carolina would sense the odor of gasoline in the air, drifting through the windows of her home in University Park, just north of USC. She started to feel a dryness in her throat, a tightness in her chest and her daughter developed a persistent cough.
Carolina, who asked that her real name be withheld out of privacy concerns, has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, and she’s not sure exactly when these problems began. 
But five years ago, other residents and neighborhood activists traced the odors back to an oil drilling site on 23rd Street, hidden behind vine-covered walls and a manicured lawn.
“It came with the breeze,” the 77-year-old said in Spanish. “I’m afraid to live here because of how it affects me.”

The site, operated by AllenCo Energy, shut down in 2013 after community organizers connected health problems in the neighborhood to the company’s oil drilling activities. In the years that followed, the City of Los Angeles sued AllenCo, and residents put pressure on the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which owns the land the oil well sits on, to shut down the site permanently.
Despite these efforts, the oil company is trying to restart operations. 
Over the past several months, the company has conducted pressure and safety tests at its 23rd Street site in an attempt to meet the city’s standards for reopening.
The idea worries community organizers like Nancy Ibrahim, the executive director and board president of local nonprofit Esperanza Community Housing. 
“If this company is ever allowed to open again, they are going to have another opportunity to poison the same families,” Ibrahim said. “This is an issue of grave concern.”
A fraught history
University Park was, quite literally, built on oil. 
The entire neighborhood sits just south of a four-mile-long oil field stretching from Dodger Stadium to Vermont Avenue, one that Edward Doheny — who funded USC’s Doheny Memorial Library — opened up to drilling in 1892. The Doheny family donated the land that now houses the AllenCo site to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which leased the site for drilling to Standard Oil of California in 1964.
Oil production slowed to a crawl in the 1990s, and the site remained mostly unused until AllenCo took over the lease in 2009. The company promptly ramped up drilling activities, producing over four times as much oil in 2010 as the year before, according to figures from the state’s Division of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources.
That’s when Ibrahim and others in the University Park community began to notice strange odors and experience sudden health problems. 
As reports of adult-onset asthma and nosebleeds trickled in, Ibrahim’s organization took a public health approach to the issue, conducting community surveys to document symptoms and encouraging residents to call the South Coast Air Quality Management District to report complaints.
The AQMD assured them the air around the site was safe after samples found low levels of noxious gases. But as residents’ symptoms persisted, Ibrahim kept calling different agencies — the Fire Department, Public Health Department, DOGGR — and said she received little information in return.
“We didn’t know what we were being exposed to,” Ibrahim said. “That really indicated a very deeply broken and entirely inadequate and non-protective regulatory environment, where the community’s needs were either obfuscated or ignored, disrespected by the entire process.”
Over three years, University Park residents made more than 250 calls to air quality officials about health problems in the vicinity of the AllenCo site, Ibrahim said. But Esperanza Community Housing’s public awareness campaigns and the Los Angeles Times’ reporting on the issue caught the attention of former Sen. Barbara Boxer, who asked the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. Several EPA officials fell ill after visiting the site, and AllenCo voluntarily suspended operations later that year.
In 2014, City Attorney Mike Feuer filed a lawsuit against AllenCo, accusing the company of ignoring warnings issued by regulatory agencies, which cited the company for failing to properly deal with hazardous materials, among other violations.
Two years later, a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge granted a permanent injunction that required AllenCo to pay $1.25 million in civil penalties and meet new requirements before it could reopen. These included installing a health and safety monitoring system with an independent expert who could shut down operations at the site if emissions of methane, hydrogen sulfide and other gases exceeded safe levels.
AllenCo did not respond to multiple email requests for comment.

The problem with oil
Jill Johnston, an assistant professor in the department of preventative medicine at USC, has been conducting air quality studies in the area immediately adjacent to the AllenCo site since 2016. So far, she has only been able to collect data while the wells have been closed, but she plans to repeat the study if they reopen — and, Johnston added, closed oil sites can still emit potentially noxious gases.
She said that many chemicals commonly used to operate and maintain oil wells have potentially harmful side effects. Hydrogen sulfide — a colorless, flammable gas found naturally in petroleum — causes inflammation of the mucous membranes, leading to nosebleeds and headaches. And some petroleum products, known generally as volatile organic compounds, can contribute to a higher risk of childhood leukemia, as well as cause headaches and dizziness.
These chemicals can leak into the air, Johnston said, traveling up to three miles from their source in ideal conditions.
“We don’t understand enough about how these chemicals are traveling,” Johnston said.
For local activists like Hugo Garcia, shutting down oil drilling operations at AllenCo is an issue of social justice. Garcia runs the “People Not Pozos” — referring to the Spanish word for oil wells – campaign for Esperanza Community Housing. 
The area where he works near the drill site is home to a mainly low-income, immigrant community with large numbers of undocumented and monolingual Spanish-speaking residents. These populations, Garcia said, are particularly vulnerable to health issues because they may not know how to fight back.
“It’s not a coincidence that you have these facilities operating in communities of color,” Garcia said. “There’s a lot of ground we need to make up. We think it’s about time.”
No tests have concretely proven that fumes from AllenCo sickened residents, but officials have found some evidence that volatile chemicals have seeped into the air surrounding the drill site.
In January 2011, 13 people fell ill at the Doheny Campus of Mount St. Mary’s College, next door to the AllenCo site, after hydrochloric acid fumes escaped the oil wells, according to the city’s 2014 complaint against the company. And in August of that year, air samples from a wastewater tank discharge line found hydrocarbons — which can be toxic — at 10,000 times the concentration of the surrounding air, the AQMD reported.
For Ibrahim, however, it’s not a question of whether AllenCo can reduce its emissions down to “safe” levels. She believes oil production is fundamentally incompatible with the needs of a residential community.
“We wanted the City Attorney’s office to protect our community by shutting them down,” Ibrahim said. “What we were talking about was not only a nuisance, but a burden of illness that in many cases has created permanent injury for folks.”
Push and pull
Because AllenCo leases the 23rd Street site, activists have focused on pressuring the Archdiocese to sever its relationship with the oil company, particularly because of the neighborhood’s strong Catholic ties.
“There is an incredulity that the Archdiocese will not be more protective of its parishioners – a sense of dismay and disappointment and betrayal,” Ibrahim said.
Garcia hopes that the Archdiocese can find an alternative use for the site, such as a park or an affordable housing complex.
“It would be a win-win scenario — one that’s in the community’s best interest,” Garcia said.
But the Archdiocese maintains that it doesn’t legally have the right to shut down the site. According to Archdiocese attorney Ed Renwick, the lease allows oil drilling operations to continue as long as AllenCo has equipment present.
“We have no objection to see if this property can be repurposed for something else,” Renwick said. “We are not tied to it as a drill site. But we have no power over it because the lease is to continue so long as AllenCo is making use of the property.”
Various city officials have also tried to shut down the site. City Councilman Gil Cedillo suggested in 2017 that the city could cancel oil drilling districts that were no longer considered active. In September, he directed the city attorney to report on all legal options that could prevent AllenCo from reopening. 
While Petroleum Administrator Uduak-Joe Ntuk said that AllenCo’s oil drilling district could not be considered “inactive,” the City Council could just repeal the drilling district altogether.

AllenCo doesn’t appear to be deterred by these efforts. The company has spent $700,000 upgrading the site to meet regulations, Renwick said, and in September it submitted a written plan to DOGGR describing its plans to restart operations at the facility. The proposal detailed plans for around-the-clock supervision and an emissions monitoring system, but federal, state and city officials will have to sign off on the changes before production operations can begin, according to an email from DOGGR media relations manager Don Drysdale.
Drysdale could not provide an estimated reopening date, but said that AllenCo has been conducting pipeline and tank integrity testing under the supervision of state regulators.
For Ibrahim, the return of full operations at AllenCo would signal disaster. In alignment with environmental justice organizations, she wants to enact a 2,500-foot safety buffer between oil production facilities and residential communities in Los Angeles.
And in University Park, she hopes to assure residents that they can live without fear of sudden health problems — as they have since AllenCo suspended operations in 2013.
“For five years, our community members have been able to open up their windows and have a cross-breeze in their apartments,” Ibrahim said. “The severe symptoms that occurred during the heyday of oil extraction have largely abated.”
