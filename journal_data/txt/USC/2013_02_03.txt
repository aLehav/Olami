The Zeta Beta Tau fraternity has currently raised the most money to donate a car through Chrysler’s crowdsourcing website for its philanthropic beneficiary, Meals on Wheels.
Chrysler’s Dodge Dart Registry is an online server that allows people to raise money to buy a new car via crowdfunding or online sponsorships. ZBT hopes to use the online registry to raise $18,000 to donate a car to Meals on Wheels, an organization that delivers healthy meals to people in the greater Los Angeles  area who are unable because of health, disability or old age.
ZBT Vice President of External Affairs Jake Kelfer said their philanthropy event represents the fraternity’s purpose.
“We wanted to be able to give back to our community,” Kelfer said. “A fraternity is more than just partying.”
According to Forbes, ZBT’s account has raised the most money of the nearly 1,000 accounts created in the first week. As of Sunday, the fraternity’s account has garnered the support of 33 sponsors, collecting a total of $2,390 in donations.
Kelfer said his fraternity is trying to spread the word about the campaign using social media, such as Facebook and Twitter.
The fraternity has 75 days to raise the remaining $15,610.

Students might have the world’s best fitness goals in mind, but plans can go south when confronted by the logistical nightmare that is an overcrowded gym. For many, this inconvenience is a determining factor in deciding whether or not to hop off the couch and work out.
Now, two USC students are launching a new mobile application called GymFlow, which provides users of the Lyon Recreation Center with real-time, up-to-the-minute gym traffic information. In addition, the application uses historical data to predict the future gym traffic and also provides a schedule of classes offered at the Lyon Center.
The free iPhone app has been in the Apple App Store since early January, but the two creators, Jiangyang Zhang, a student in the electrical engineering doctorate program, and Jimmy Liu, a senior majoring in business administration, are officially launching the app at the Lyon Center today.
This app was created for a final project for the students’ class. Zhang and Liu believed in the practicality of the product, since there has not been any app similar to GymFlow on the market before, and thought it would be useful to see how packed the gym is at a specific given time.
Zhang developed the app using Objective-C, the main programming language for the Apple OS X and iOS operating systems. In order to get accurate data, he incorporated an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze the data obtained from the card swiping system at the Lyon Center, which was made available to Zhang and Liu by the USC Recreational Sport Center and USCard Services. In addition to the base features, Zhang is currently working on social features for the app to help students connect.
Meanwhile, Zhang and Liu have been marketing the app in the Lyon Center with flyers and advocating the app on their main website, social media and through specified outreach: the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity has already been promoting this app to its members.
Justine Gilman, senior director of Recreational Sports, said many students have requested an app similar to this in past years.
“Many students have requested an app similar to GymFlow over the years,” Gilman said. “This is the perfect response to that. This is indeed an innovative, creative and a valuable tool to the USC community.”
Liu said the app will encourage people to come to the Lyon Center and further promote health fitness.
“One of the main reasons people don’t go to the gym is not because they’re lazy,” Liu said. “A lot of people don’t like working out because it’s an intimidating environment when the gym is crowded.”
Some students believe the app will better facilitate the traffic flow at the Lyon Center.
“I actually really like [GymFlow]. I was really surprised [it works well] because it goes off of our swipe card system and they assume everybody is here for an hour, but it’s still pretty accurate,” said Michael Campana, a senior majoring in business administration.
As of noon on Sunday there have been 321 downloads and the user retention rate is much higher than the two creators expected.
“The Lyon Center is sort of our test bucket; eventually we want to launch the app for gyms in the L.A. region,” Zhang said.
Zhang and Liu are working on launching it on the Android market later this semester.

In its last match before the ITA National Team Indoor championships next week, the USC women’s tennis team defeated Fresno State at Marks Stadium for a fifth consecutive victory.
The Women of Troy have won five straight matches to open up the season, all of which have been sweeps. USC coach Richard Gallien’s group has made the statement that it is a team to be reckoned with early on in the season.
USC easily wrapped up the doubles matches with a slightly different set of pairings this time around. Instead of having two seniors play together, senior Danielle Lao and sophomore Giuliana Olmos were locked into the No. 2 spot, and they took down a Bulldogs’ duo of Melissa McQueen and Anne Susdorf. In the three hole, senior Valeria Pulido was paired with freshman Ellie Yates, and the difference in age did nothing to hinder their play on the court, as the two easily defeated the Fresno State team of Anneka and Sophie Watts.
In the singles portion of the match, No. 17 sophomore Sabrina Santamaria once again shined playing in the top spot. She left Aishwarya Agrawal on zero in both of the sets, winning 6-0, 6-0. Next in line was Olmos, who has garnered much attention early this year. The sophomore made quick work of Bianca Modoc in the third slot with a 6-3, 6-0 win.
Yates clinched the victory with a throttling of FSU’s Anne Susdorf on court five. The freshman was just one game shy of a shutout, but her 6-0, 6-1 win was good enough to seal the match for USC.
With the game in hand, Lao and junior Kaitlyn Christian finished off their opponents in the second and fourth slots, respectively. Pulido and Anneka Watts played the most exciting match of the day on court six, with the third set playing out into a game-deciding tiebreaker. Despite losing the first set, Pulido would pull out the second and then finish off Watts in the tiebreaker 10-4.
Riding a hot streak, the Women of Troy are poised to make a run in the ITA National Team Indoor championships on Feb. 8.

The USC women’s swimming and diving team swam upstream to the Bay Area with showdowns against the No. 7 Cal Golden Bears on Friday and the No. 2 Stanford Cardinal on Saturday. The No. 1 Women of Troy (9-1, 5-1) entered the final month of regular-season action showing why they are on top of the collegiate rankings, pulling out a 155-145 victory over the Golden Bears. But on Saturday, USC suffered its first defeat of the season, losing 158-137 to Stanford.
The Women of Troy pulled out victories in eight of 16 events against Cal, with junior Stina Gardell sealing the win with a strong swim in the 200-yard individual medley. The two-time defending national champion Bears fell to 5-2 overall (2-2 in the Pac-12).
“I am very proud of the women,” USC head coach Dave Salo said. “The keys to the win were some strong performances from [junior] Kasey Carlson and [freshman] Kendyl Stewart. We sealed the win with an outstanding swim from Stina Gardell, winning the 200 IM to seal the win before the relay. The divers, led by [freshman] Sam Adams, were critical to keep us in the meet and have a chance to win.”
The Golden Bears had a lead early in the meet, winning five of the first eight events to put the Women of Troy down 78-72 at the break, but USC quickly recovered.
USC secured its first win of the day in the 1000-yard freestyle as senior Haley Anderson took first (9:52.98) and junior Lynette Lim (9:53.20) took second.
Carlson also clocked in a big win, swimming the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 23.03. She came through once again as she earned her second win of the day in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 49.50.
Stewart had strong swims in the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke events, taking second in both, while freshman Joanna Stenkvist finished third in the 200-yard backstroke (1:58.70) to earn valuable points for the Women of Troy. Stewart finished first in the 100-yard butterfly (52.88), her first top finish of the day and a key swim for USC.
The Women of Troy divers helped sustain the womens’ dominance throughout the day, as Adams and sophomore Haley Ishimatsu finished first and second, respectively, in 3-meter diving. In the 1-meter competition, Ishimatsu took first and Adams finished third.
The meet’s penultimate swim was the 200-yard IM, featuring the 2012 NCAA champions in Cal’s senior Caitlin Leverenz and freshman Elizabet Pelton, along with USC’s Gardell. Gardell came through to edge out both Pelton and Leverenz to finish first with a qualifying time of 1:58.30. Gardell’s swim clinched the meet for USC.
After the impressive win against Cal, the Women of Troy were unable to keep the momentum going against the Cardinal. However, the powerhouse matchup between these two schools didn’t disappoint. The Women of Troy ultimately fell to the Cardinal, 158-137. Anderson, a co-captain and 2012 Olympic silver medalist, won two events for USC.
The loss was the first of the season for the top-ranked Women of Troy. The Cardinal, on senior night, won their fifth-consecutive dual meet to improve to 7-1.
Anderson won the 1000 free (9:53.52) and 500 free (4:46.71). Redshirt sophomore Andrea Kropp earned nine points by finishing first in the 200 breast (2:11.73). Ishimatsu won the 1-meter dive with a score of 301.88.
Looking to bounce back, the Women of Troy have a break before hosting rival UCLA in the final regular-season showdown on Feb. 16 at noon.

This Wednesday marks the most scrutinized date during college football’s offseason: national signing day. Forty-year-old men will log onto Twitter, troll, then “unfollow” high school recruits who elect to sign with their alma mater’s rivals. Coaches will hole up in their offices all day, waiting for the signed letters of intent to filter through their fax machines. Current players will witness the fruits of their labor after hosting several recruits on official visits.
As overhyped and nauseating as national signing day has become, there’s still ample evidence that recruiting stars matter, especially when programs’ so-called “can’t-miss” recruits perform as expected and justify their hype. For example, Matt Barkley and Robert Woods, USC’s 2009 and 2010 consensus top recruits, respectively, both appear ticketed for the 2013 NFL draft’s first round.
Of course, high school recruiting remains an inexact science. Not every five-star recruit pans out, and countless less-heralded prospects flourish.
Oftentimes, highly touted recruits fall flat because that’s the nature of the business. It’s dicey predicting how a 17-year-old kid will respond to a marked uptick in competition and the various time demands of performing as a Division I student-athlete. Indeed, many recent USC recruits, to this point of their careers, have failed to meet expectations. Out of the 2011 recruiting class’ top-10 signees according to ESPN, only one — sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee — started in more than two games for USC this past season.
That said, national signing day still wields a magnetic quality, if only because we’re all just starved for more college football news and eagerly counting down the days until spring practice. In that vein, I’ll break down who I consider to be USC’s three most important recruiting targets in the 2013 class, excluding the seven players who already enrolled early at USC this spring semester.
Cornerback Jalen Ramsey
It’s no secret that USC’s secondary is in shambles. A team that has consistently allowed opponents about seven yards per passing attempt in the past three seasons just lost its top three safeties and junior Nickell Robey — USC’s only shutdown cornerback option.
Ramsey, a 6-foot speedster from Tennessee’s Brentwood Academy, would help restock USC’s bare cornerback cupboard. Rated ESPN’s No. 14 overall prospect in the nation, the USC verbal commit has left some observers thinking that he might renege on his promise and choose the University of Florida or Florida State come Wednesday. Those sentiments intensified when USC recently fired defensive backs coach Marvin Sanders. But if USC reels in the star prospect, the Trojans can pair him with fellow 2013 recruit Chris Hawkins to form an enviable cornerback tandem for the next few years.
Defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes
Originally a USC commit, Vanderdoes decommitted from the Trojans on Dec. 27, citing no particular reason other than the fact that he enjoyed in-home visits from Notre Dame, Washington and UCLA. Since that time, USC has clearly prioritized landing the consensus five-star talent. Vanderdoes would fit new defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s 3-4 defensive scheme perfectly as a nose tackle who can occupy multiple blockers.
Rumors persist, however, that the 310-pound brick wall currently leans toward signing with UCLA — a not-so-enticing prospect given USC’s porous offensive line. Regrettably, former four-star defensive end commit Kylie Fitts, who starred in the football program’s latest controversy when USC head coach Lane Kiffin disallowed him from enrolling early days before the spring semester began, appears poised to join Vanderdoes along that Bruin defensive line. Ace recruiter Ed Orgeron needs to live up to his reputation here.
Running back Ty Isaac
In one of his many postseason retrospectives, Kiffin vowed that USC will return to a more physical style of play on offense. Isaac, a 6-foot-3, 217-pound tailback from Joliet, Ill., factors heavily into that plan. The verbal commit, who amassed 45 touchdowns as a junior, features a nice blend of power and elusiveness.
For the first time since 2009-— when the Trojans fielded Joe McKnight, Stafon Johnson and Allen Bradford -— USC appears to have an abundance of viable tailback options. Senior running back Silas Redd will likely start, but competition for his immediate backup will be stiff. Promising sophomore Tre Madden will return from a torn ACL and freshman Justin Davis — a fellow four-star talent — has already enrolled early this spring.
Though the 15 hours of coverage on ESPNU is laughably obnoxious, like it or not, Wednesday matters. After a ghastly 2012, national signing day begins USC’s long ascent back to national — heck, even Pac-12 — preeminence.
 
“Leveling the Playing Field” runs Mondays. To comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Sean McCormick at swmccorm@usc.edu. 
Already lost Ramsey and Hatcher… Clearly this class’s quality/player is still incredible, but being able to hold live practices – which is especially crucial given the lack of physicality on D last year – is becoming a concern. I hope Kiffin has a few surprises up his sleeve. It’s looking like we’ll need them. FIGHT ON

The No. 2 USC men’s tennis team faced its first top-20 ranked opponent of the season Friday when it played host to No. 17 University of Texas at Marks Stadium. The match was billed as the first true test for USC, but the Trojans had all the answers, not dropping a single set en route to a 7-0 sweep of the Longhorns.
Easy victories · Junior Ray Sarmiento picked up wins in both singles play (6-3, 6-2) and doubles play (8-6) against the University of Texas. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The proceedings kicked off with a hotly contested doubles point that saw junior Emilio Gomez and sophomore Eric Johnson fall 8-1 to the Longhorns’ tandem of senior Daniel Whitehead and junior David Holiner. The Trojans would recover by winning the two following doubles matches, both with a score of 8-6.
In singles play, Friday saw the return of junior Ray Sarmiento, who missed the first four matches because of an abdominal injury. Sarmiento, ranked No. 10 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, initially showed no signs of rust in his return to action against Texas junior Sudanwa Sitaram. Sarmiento’s calves, however, began to cramp at 5-0 in the first set, inhibiting his movement. Sarmiento would eventually recover and cruise to a 6-3, 6-2 victory.
“It felt good to be back out there with my teammates,” Sarmiento said. “I’m feeling fine. My [abdominal injury] is feeling better; I thank my PT [USC trainer Andrew Marcos] for that.”
Things did not go as smoothly for freshman Max de Vroome, who fought back from being down 5-2 in his first set against Holiner. De Vroome would recover and secure the first set in a tiebreak, 7-6(3). The second set turned out to be an encore of the first: Armed with a steely resolve and an overpowering first serve, de Vroome again fought back from being down a break 6-5 to clinch the sweep in tiebreaks for a final score of 7-6(3), 7-6. After the match, de Vroome admitted he had trouble “finding his game,” but gave credit to his opponent Holiner.
“I came back from being down 5-2. Normally you would be deflated,” de Vroome said. “But he just kept fighting.”
When de Vroome was asked what he could do to improve, he assumed full responsibility for Friday’s nail-biter.
“I have to be more consistent and disciplined in what I do,” de Vroome said.
For a team that has won four consecutive NCAA Division I titles, consistency can entail otherworldly standards. Despite a strong showing against the No. 17 team in the country, USC head coach Peter Smith insists that the Trojans are just looking forward with one goal in mind:
“Keep building,” Smith said. “All of [these matches] are glorified practice. We’re building towards something greater.”
Smith, architect of the current Trojan men’s tennis dynasty, will continue the building process as USC hosts highly touted Cal and Stanford on Friday and Saturday, respectively,

After splitting the first two games in their four-game homestand, the USC women’s basketball team had an opportunity to move up in the Pac-12 standings with matchups against the Utah Utes and No. 22 Colorado Buffaloes. But once again, the Trojan’s play in the second half was the story of the weekend, as they were defeated in both matchups after leading at halftime.
Shooting struggles · Sophomore guard Ariya Crook finished 4-15 from the field against the No. 22 Colorado Buffaloes on Sunday. The Women of Troy were just 14-51 (27.5 percent) for the game overall. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Utes stumbled into the Galen Center, having lost eight of their last nine contests. They did not, however, show it against the Trojans; right off the bat, some clutch 3-point shooting had the Utes keeping pace. USC was still able to maintain a solid lead in the first half, leading 30-27. But the Women of Troy were unable to hold off Utah in the second half. The Utes shot 57 percent from the field and tacked on 13 points from the foul line to sink USC. Despite 19 points from forward Cassie Harberts, USC fell 63-60.
Colorado, too, was suffering from recent struggles before facing USC, with only a 4-5 conference record despite a top-25 ranking. Off the bat, Colorado made the Women of Troy work by dominating the boards and shooting well from the field. However, the Women of Troy were able to keep pace, taking advantage of some clutch 3-point shooting from junior forward Desiree Bradley. As a result, the Trojans entered the locker room at the half with a 31-26 lead.
For the second time this weekend, though, USC came out flat for the second half and Colorado was able to capitalize. Though USC’s defense held off the Buffalo attack at first, the ineffectiveness of the offense at the other end of the court spelled doom. Colorado opened the half on a 15-2 run and did not look back from there.
Buffalo guards Chucky Jeffery and Arielle Roberson led the attack with their sound shooting. They combined for 31 points in the game as well as 16 rebounds.  Even with Harberts’ 14 points and six rebounds, USC could not overcome the deficit and lost by a decisive score of 65-49.
“They got into the paint a lot more than we did,” Harberts said. “We knew coming into this game that Chucky Jeffery and Brittany Wilson are big rebounders for guards and we didn’t execute well.”
In addition to rebounding, the large number of turnovers hurt the Trojans. Colorado jumped all over the poor passing of the Trojans, scoring 19 points off turnovers.
“It’s very frustrating,” Bradley said. “We want to win at home and we want to show our fans that we’re playing for them as well as for ourselves. It’s just something that we have to do better.”
The Women of Troy head north for their next two games, with important matchups against Washington State and Washington.
The team and coaches are just plain lousy. Need a new staff and some high quality recruits. Something is
wrong when too many players are injured before and during the season. Attendance is a joke while Haden sits
by analyzing the situation which is obvious to the few fans who give a darn.

It’s not uncommon for a college student to spend a lazy Sunday sitting around, watching Netflix and catching up on episode after episode of his or her favorite show.
Whether it’s Friends, Pretty Little Liars, or whatever the obsession is that  week, quality time spend lying in bed enjoying the same show back-to-back can prove to be an relaxing, albeit lethargic, way to spend the day.
This habit of watching television for long periods of time is so typical these days that it has even earned its own term: binge watching.  In fact, blogger Jim Pagels has even spoken out about this form of TV watching on the blog “browbeat” in an article titled “Stop Binge-Watching TV.”
In the article, he lists different points explaining why binge watching is not recommended. However, while Pagels clearly believes that this way of watching television is not healthy, one thing is clear: binge watching is happening — a lot.
There are many possible reasons binge watching has taken off. For one, it works as a glorious way to procrastinate. After all, watching seven hours straight of  Breaking Bad is far better and more enjoyable than cleaning up or writing a tedious research paper.
And anyway, after postponing the work for one episode, what’s the harm in watching another episode, and another episode after that one? Soon it turns into an unnecessary circle of enthused laughs, mystery, fear and character obsession.
Another reason people could be continuously binge watching is because shows these days are addicting.
For example, the show Fringe, which is quite possibly one of the most underrated shows of all time, is extremely addicting — watch one episode and there is no going back.
Take a dive into an unpredictable world where shapeshifters are sent from another time, bald men witness important historical events, and another alternate universe exists.
It sounds insane and geared towards sci-fi fans, but Fringe is a show that appeals to television junkies of all tastes. In the show, a group of FBI agents explore “fringe” events — unexpected, scientifically unexplainable phenomenons —while ultimately trying to save two universes (but it’s less cheesy than it sounds, of course).
Each episode has a cliffhanger that leaves the audience in agony, wanting to know what happens next. This is how binge watching gets started: After one episode, it’s hard not to continue watching to find out what the crazy, hilarious, old man fighting crime is going to do next.
Moreover, in a show like Fringe, where science fiction is combined with dramatic love stories, hilarious one-liners and character-identity formation, it is easy to become entranced by all of these elements to the point that it becomes impossible to stop watching. Hence, it’s the ideal “binge show.”
Yet despite the reasons behind binge watching, Pagels clearly is against it for a series of reasons. First of all, he says that “episodes have their own integrity, which is blurred by watching several in a row.”
Pagels says that two story lines exist: the one in the whole season that continues through episodes, and the one in each specific episode. This argument, hence, means that watching multiple episodes in a row can hinder the contemplation of a single episode’s meaning and importance.
This continuing story arc, however, is the reason why people feel the need to watch the next episode right away.
In the show Smash, the episode’s story arc is instantly addicting (for example, both Katharine McPhee and Megan Hilty’s characters audition for the same role), so most viewers want to know more right away and continue to watch.
And contrary to what Pagels says, this doesn’t ruin the storyline; instead, it can help seamlessly progress ideas and characters from one episode through the bigger story arc, making the big picture more satisfying.
The second reason Pagels criticizes this rapid form of TV watching is because cliffhangers and suspense need time to breathe. Tying in with the above, however, it’s just the opposite. After watching one episode of Smash or Fringe, the viewer might be so busy with their daily activities and other shows they might not remember important details a week later.
Especially in shows where there are so many little details and actions going on, it can be confusing to watch the next episode later on (it’s almost necessary to have a recap right before the new one).
Pagels’ third point is that “episode recaps and online communities provide key analysis and insight.” Unlike some of his other criticisms, this is a great point. In fact, with smartphones and the Internet, feedback about episodes and important conversations can be viewed by anyone immediately, allowing ample research into the characters’ motives, giving greater insight into the show.
These are just a couple of reasons why Pagels argues against binge TV watching. Despite his reasons, the concept of binge TV watching is a new and ubiquitous concept that comes with students’ hours of Netflix obsessions and an increase in television availability.
And if a show like Smash or Fringe is so good that it makes viewers want to watch multiple episodes at a time, the folks behind the camera are doing something right. So if someone is stuck in a binging frenzy — all the power to them (after all, it’s definitely healthier than binging on cupcakes or chocolate).

Set in a fantasy world divided by an imaginary line between the morbid and the magical, LoveSick is a play that follows the lives of two young people from different walks of life as they go through a journey of self-discovery, only to discover that they have more in common than either would ever believe. With its warped sense of humor, the play, which runs at the Loft Ensemble Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles for a limited engagement until Feb. 24, provides a unique insight into the darker side of love.
The play begins in a graveyard where tombstones protrude from the floor. In this spooky setting, lead character Benjamin (Adam Chambers) and his two friends (Noah Benjamin and Matt McCroskey) discuss their fascination with all things dark and creepy. The dedication put forth by the cast into fleshing out their respective roles is evident throughout the entire production: The complex scenes are handled with such expertise that the audience easily can relate to the characters despite their surreal surroundings.
Switching from the morose to the magical, the play then introduces the very different life of Sophia, played by writer and director Larissa Wise. Sophia comes from a very different background than Benjamin. The audience’s first glimpse of Sophia is in an imaginary toy box, filled with colorful toys and gigantic teddy bears.  The contrast between Benjamin’s situation and Sophia’s gives the audience a visual interpretation of how vastly different the worlds of these soon-to-be lovers are. Opposites do attract, after all.
Benjamin and Sophia cross paths when she ventures to the graveyard. As soon as Benjamin steals a look at Sophia, he is immediately captivated by her glow and sweet, charming innocence, decidedly different than the ghoulish existence he’s familiar with. Despite opposition from his friends and Sally (Christina Joy Howard), a woman who is romantically pursuing Benjamin herself, he sets out to see Sophia again. Fortunately for Benjamin, Sophia is equally as enchanted with him as he is with her.
Actors Wise and Chambers definitely steal the show. In particular Wise proves to be a talented actor, writer and director, whose vision of the play works to capture the hearts and minds of audience members.
Chambers excels as a performer; his natural ability to entertain the audience with wit and quirky gestures adds a sense of authenticity to the show.
LoveSick elevates the sometimes overdone starcrossed-lovers storyline through its well-orchestrated dance scenes, colorful costumes and the poetic brilliance of the cast. With unique special effects, this play satisfies visually as well as thematically. Each member of the cast feels essential, with every performance adding its own substance to the show. Benjamin, McCroskey, Marissa Galloway and Jessica Botello all do an exceptional job as supporting characters, allowing Chambers and Wise’s characters to shine. And Howard and Jason Ryan Lovett (Frank) infuse their villainous characters with unique style and comic undertones, making them alarmingly real.
Despite the superb acting and the unconventional use of poetry, there are sexual undertones and physical movements that some audience members might find a bit raunchy and disturbing. Nevertheless, LoveSick successfully accomplishes what it set out to do — to entertain.

Facebook has more than one billion users; Newsweek magazine has shut down its printing presses; meanwhile, the Huffington Post flaunts 8 million unique users. It is fair to say that the health of print media is noticeably decaying every month. But the L.A. Art Book Fair at the Museum of Contemporary Art, held Friday through Sunday, proved that print media is by no means ready to roll over and die just yet.
Power of print · The L.A. Art Book Fair at the Museum of Contemporary Art celebrates print and art through its showcase of books, poetry, academic journals, vintage magazines and hand-printed comics. – Courtesy of The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA
The venue was bursting with artsy people, all quirkily dressed to the extreme ends of hipster fashion. Poetry, academic journals, photography collections, vintage magazines, hand-printed comics, posters, philosophical pamphlets and everything in between decorated the tables, manned by artists and publishers promoting their ideas and selling their wares.
“We do lots of collaborations with artists,” said Martin Masetto, who is a representative of the New York-based Arts and Sciences Project, as he sat behind a table covered with books of photographs by artists from all over the world. “They look similar and yet they’re all very different.”
The importance of cooperation between artists and publishers was evident in every room of the Geffen Contemporary, where the lines blurred between genres as well as between business people and artists. Though Masetto was not involved at the fair as an artist himself, he seemed to possess the passion for creativity that any committed artist would as he excitedly described the debut of a new book of photography.
Both an artist and an entrepreneur, Eunice Luk set up at the fair on behalf of her business Fantasy Camp.
“We do mostly hand-bound books and screen-printed posters and newspaper,” she said proudly.
When asked what goes into the making of her printed comics, she replied with a laugh, “Time! We handprint the whole edition, so it’s a lot of work, but it’s satisfying because we really want a rich black, not like a conventional newspaper.”
Without a business-savvy leader, art producers like Fantasy Camp would suffer in the competitiveness of modern art, and, of course, businessmen  would be slow to earn a profit if they were lacking talented artists. But thanks to well-received conventions such as the L.A. Art Book Fair, artists and publishers have had great success in networking their abilities and their resources to forge lasting partnerships.
“I like coming to these fairs and meeting people,” said Paul Windle, an illustrator. He met Luk at a past New York Art Book Fair, and the two ended up sharing a table at the Los Angeles event. “I mostly do editorial illustrations for newspapers and magazines, but I’ve always made zines and screen-prints, so I keep doing it.” And nowhere would Windle’s extraordinary artwork have had a more comfortable home than his table at the festival surrounded by the equally creative and ambitious artist-entrepreneurs that populated the rest of the gallery.
Another like-minded organizer named Kelly Jones advocated a more forward-thinking way to enjoy art books. “At Little Paper Planes, we do printing and publishing of different print collections,” she said, “but it’s all based online.”
Though the 9-year-old business hopes to open a store in San Francisco soon, the arts organization has found a way to remain unique and relevant via the Internet. Folks like Jones believe that as entertainment and news are moving to a partial or complete digital state, so, too, is the world of modern art.
“We do online exhibitions where we work with artists that work in interesting media like sound or video,” Jones continued, “and then they culminate in publications at the end of the process.”
Because no one can deny the possibility that art could one day become a standard form of digital media, some innovators are already beginning to look to the future of online art in hopes of ensuring that this would be a future in hopes that artists could still express their full creativity.
Greg Albers, the publisher of Hol Art Books, is one of the leading figures in the digital publication of artist books. Aside from selling printed jacket sleeves of his company’s books with attached codes that unlock e-book versions on Apple’s iBookstore, Albers used his booth at the fair to promote his Kickstarter initiative for the funding and production of an Apple app called The People’s E-Book.
“Our idea is that e-books are not very interesting right now compared to artist books and creative things we see coming out of the print world,” Albers explains. “The problem is that artists and authors don’t really know what an e-book is.”
According to Albers, most of the especially creative art books that include more than simple text and photos cannot be translated well onto an e-reader or a computer screen, and the creation of a satisfying e-book is an undertaking that requires too much time, effort and money to complete properly. “There’s no easy way to make an e-book, so we want something that will let you put one out in a matter of minutes instead of hours.”
After being active for only two days, The People’s E-Book Kickstarter page had raised over $2,300, but the group still needs about $7,700 before March 2 to become fully funded. So as art and literature slowly move online, Albers aims to “jumpstart creative e-book publishing” by making the process easy, free and available to anyone through his newly designed app.
Despite the decline of print, the afternoon was a glorious testament to the talented masters of print media. The apparent success of Los Angeles’ maiden hosting of New York’s Art Book Fair suggests that the event will return next year. And though the art scene may be shifted a little further away from print by then, two things can be certain: the fair will still be the site of some of the most fascinating print art in the world, and innovators like Albers will be closer to making print artists fall in love with the inevitable online revolution.

All are now well aware of the fact that, over winter break, the university implemented several new security measures. The most visible is the construction of multiple new fences on the north side of campus, as well as a barrier on the south side of campus, across Trousdale Parkway.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
Nevertheless, during the three weeks in which school has been in session, many have grown  more and more worried over the effects this fence might have upon USC’s relationship with the surrounding community. Some students also worry that the fence serves as a symbol to those living around campus that the university believes them to be more foe than friend.
USC’s code of ethics explains how the university intends to “serve as a bright beacon for all peoples … by respecting the rights and dignity of others and by striving for fairness and honesty in our dealings with others.”
One can’t help to notice how, recently, that beacon burns less brightly.
On paper, these fences serve as a means to prevent agents not affiliated with the university from entering the campus and committing detrimental acts. The creation of these fences is an understandable move on the university’s part. In light of the Halloween shooting, many are pleased that the university has enacted more stringent security measures. The decisions to limit the entrances to campus and increase security presence after hours are both commendable on the university’s part.
But students and faculty alike question the construction of the fence across Trousdale and along the north side of campus. People understand that the fence is in place for campus security. But there is still a question of what the external cost of having such a visible barrier between USC and the surrounding community is. One must wonder what those in the surrounding community think and feel when they see the university intent upon keeping them out, especially considering that USC’s code of ethics also explains how “we nurture an environment of mutual respect and tolerance.”
The construction of the fence on the north side of campus — a side which, unlike the south, is directly connected with the surrounding residential areas — is an action which does not conform to the university’s policy of mutual respect and tolerance, in this case to our neighbors in the surrounding community.
Instead of showing that USC is a tolerant, accepting community, the fence shows just the opposite: that the university and its students are neither respectful nor tolerant of the surrounding neighborhood and view it as a threat that must be kept away.
The broad assumption that the surrounding neighborhood is filled with people who wish nothing but malice upon USC and its students could not be further from the truth.
Though it’s no secret that the communities surrounding the university are of a radically different socioeconomic makeup than the university itself, something many connected with the university fail to realize is that those who live in the surrounding neighborhood are people, like you and me, who are simply living their lives in peaceful coexistence with those affiliated for the university.
Crime certainly exists in the neighborhood, something those who live in it know too well. But crimes that occur on campus rarely come from sources completely independent of the university: Indeed, the most recent DPS incident resolution received on Jan. 27 regarding student property stolen from EVK and New North says “the suspect was not a USC student but was an invited guest of a USC student.”
The fence around campus represents a fundamental misgiving many have about people who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds than their own. Those who come from different (read: less affluent) backgrounds than our own are not to be viewed with the animosity that they so often receive. Difference, after all, does not equate to danger.
The effect of the new fence around campus, as well as other university developments into the near future, has on the university’s already tarnished reputation in the surrounding community needs to be recognized on a wider scale. Until it does, there will continue to be a certain irony in the university calling itself respectful and tolerant of difference — when clearly our neighbors are given neither.

The Grad student shooting I was referring to happened last April/May where two students were sitting in their car late at night off campus and someone attempted to carjack them. I’m not sure if they resisted, but two students ended up dead. The carjacker also didn’t shoot and leave. He made sure they were dead. One student was crawling away from the seen and his bloody handprints were found on the doorknob of a nearby house as he tried to get help. As far as not pooping where you eat, this crime I just described was obviously not a planned event; It was a crime of opportunity. This lends support to the idea that the carjacker was a resident of the neighborhood. Yes this crime happened off of campus and the incident at Halloween waas *only* near fatal. So by your reasoning we should have to wait for a fatal incident to happen on campus before we tighten down security? My main argument is that considering the recent uptick in violent crime on and around the campus, there had to be some security measures taken and as a starting point, what we have done is good. There is a lot of room for improvement which I am sure the university knows and will change as needed. I wouldn’t go as far as to say that the community members have no say because they don’t pay to go to USC. That kind of pretentious attitude towards the community is not productive to either party. We have a duty to engage the community and help the community, but the community also has a duty to engage us and their peers to help stem violence and create less of a divide between them and the students/faculty/staff. This is an incredibly complex issue and the solutions will be equally complex. There will never be a solution that is the end-all-be-all that solves every issue. The university reacted to a tragic situation with what they felt was best and I support them in that.
I agree completely the fence is a waste of resources and sends a hostile message to the surrounding community. It is a lame and all too transparent reaction to placate those like I who believe that Michael Jackson should be fired for inviting and/or allowing gangbangers onto our beloved campus.  Jackson ultimately is responsible for the shootings that occurred.  His lack of leadership should not be rewarded by constructing such an albatross around USC.  USC has survived for well over 100 years without a fence, including the Rodney King riots of 1992, and there is no good reason to construct one today.  I think all USC students should demand that the administration remove the fence, or band together and tear it down.
USC has “a Tarnished Reputation with the Communtiy”? 
Who are you speaking with? The thousands of area students that get free tutoring, mentoring, summer camps, arts, etc provided by USC? Or is it the community leaders who just commanded $20m as their price for allowing USC to better the community by providing services and jobs through the construction of the new Village? Maybe its all the workers who live in the community that are employed by USC? Is it the families that benefit from the increased sense of safety that comes with the huge amounts of resources USC puts into neighborhood security?
Honestly, who are you speaking with that gives you this impression or is this you just making this up?
Get with the program. USC is a huge part of the growing community that is south/central LA. We are respected and loved by the vast majority that live here. Most of the local kids would die to attend USC. Naturally differences occur, as they do with all neighbors.But, the fact that we have put locks on our doors, like everyone else in the community,  does not change our relationshiop or commitment to those that surround us.
I think you are way off base here, Mr. Tinoko.
There has been a lot of points made about how the community members are not that different from ours. With regard to that, we are forgetting that the several instances of fatal and near fatal violence has been created by members of that community. Those few that are committing crimes ruin the reputation for the rest of the community. It is impossible to determine which community members are the ones who are going to commit crimes and the ones that have no intention of doing so. Therefore there is no way to selectively let certain non-USC students on campus late at night and prevent others from doing the same. There seems to so much pressure on USC to “fix” the neighborhood around it. I think USC has a certain amount of responsibility to do so, but I’ve never heard one person call on the non-violent community members to help fix their own community. They have a certain amount of responsibility to do so and I do no believe that they are. Ultimately there needs to be a balance between outreach to the community and isolation from the community. I would venture to guess that the community members who want to be on campus late at night when campus is closed are the ones that are up to know good. During the day when the rest of the community is doing business they are perfectly welcome. There is nothing stopping them from coming on to campus. If the community is really that upset about the new barriers, ask them to help weed out the people who make the barriers needed.
Two points. 
1. Only one fatal / near fatal event occurred on campus. Perp was on-campus because of reckless use of party promoter. Use of such promoters is now banned.
2. Locals generally don’t commit the fatal / near fatal crimes. Only one I’m awaree of involved the fatal stabbing of a grad student stemming from a verbal altercation with a neighborhood resident. 
Criminals from outside the neighborhood come here to target students. Same thing happens at UCLA. The campus’s actual neighbors are smart enough to know that, as the saying goes, you shouldn’t poop where you eat.
Where is the data to support your final claim? How do we know where these people are from? As far as I’m concerned, leave any measures in place until data says otherwise. Even then, the entitled attitude of the community of “we are as much a part of USC as anyone else is” is, frankly, irritating. Do they as a whole pay money to go here or get paid to work here? No. Students do. Therefore, they get little to no say.

In October 2009,students sued Lesley University for failing to offer adequate dining accommodations for those affected by celiac disease and other food allergies. Thanks to the Department of Justice, on Dec. 20, 2012, Lesley signed an agreement to “ensure that students with celiac disease and other food allergies can fully and equally enjoy the university’s meal plan and food services in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.”
According to the Justice Department, “food allergies may constitute a disability under the ADA” because they can cause severe reactions such as anaphylaxis and permanent, potentially life-threatening internal damage. So, though USC’s dining halls do offer several options for gluten-free students, it is imperative that the university ensure its labelling practices and menu offerings are up to par.
USC might assume that most students choose to eat gluten-free for the apparent health benefits: gluten-free diets reportedly contribute to weight loss, increased alertness, decreased bloating and more. Consequently, because some gluten-free foods are considerably more expensive than standard dining hall grub, the university would be sustaining a supply of extremely costly meals mostly so students could join in on another diet fad.
Though gluten-free diets might be on the rise, to use this as a basis for the few gluten-free dining options would be to ignore the harsher reality: those with celiac disease really don’t have a choice. In fact, for them, even the smallest contact with gluten can have dangerous consequences.
While dining halls offer gluten-free offerings, they are not always labelled, requiring celiac students to ask workers to ensure that foods labelled as gluten-free are, in fact, free of the allergen. USC should make it a priority to mark each dish served in the dining halls accurately every single day. It should also label other potential allergy-triggering foods, such as dairy, instead of limiting it to gluten.
And to ensure that only those who truly need it have access to allergen-free foods, USC could borrow from its crosstown rival: UCLA requires students to provide medical documentation in order to gain keycard access to a pantry containing a toaster, microwave, refrigerator and gluten-free foods. The university currently offers all meal-plan students access to gluten-free foods, but requiring students to remain so vigilant to maintain their dietary needs, when students who live in certain USC dorms or apartments are required to pay for meal plans, isn’t right.
Several more colleges have successfully implemented changes to meet the needs of students with allergies. The greatest drawback of introducing these gluten-free dining options is undoubtedly the cost. Boston University’s pantry cost $6,500 to equip, while its kitchen, open to all 10,000 students on the meal plan, cost $47,000. UCLA’s pantry cost more than $16,000 and services about 30 of the 10,000 students on the meal plan. But from public school to private school, the expenses are a small price to pay in order to ensure the health and safety of all.
If USC were to follow suit and install gluten-free stations on its campus, rather than merely offering some gluten-free options, it should charge all students, regardless of allergy, the standard meal plan prices and cover the extra cost, as did the University of New Hampshire, Durham.
USC’s responsibility is to nurture, but when it comes to students with food allergies, there is much room to grow. Intellectual and physical well-being is at stake whenever getting a balanced meal is made difficult, and it’s even more important in the face of specific dietary needs.

True, diagnosed Celiac is not very common and many jump of the gluten free band wagon thinking that they have this disease, when what has truly helped them is getting all the processed garbage out of their diet.  In a perfect world, we would teach human nutrition based on science, not based on who funded the education.  Much of the nutrition information is underwritten by the diary and meat industries.  The China Study should be required reading.  It would make for a healthy population and a healthier planet.
Thank you for recognizing the difference between someone with Celiac and those who choose a gluten-free diet.
