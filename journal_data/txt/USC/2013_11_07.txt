Leading Holocaust scholars from China and Israel discussed their unique perspectives on the Holocaust in an event sponsored by the USC Shoah Foundation on Thursday.
Global scope · Xin Xu, director of the Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies at Nanjing University, explained his teaching experience on Thursday. – Juliette Pisani | Daily Trojan
 
USC Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen Smith moderated the discussion between Xin Xu, director of the Glazer Insitute of Jewish Studies at Nanjing University, and Yehuda Bauer, professor emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The scholars explained their experiences teaching about the Holocaust in different corners of the globe.
The two scholars spoke about how different cultures across the globe can learn from each other through the perspective of the Holocaust, as well as other genocides.
“You can’t measure suffering,” Bauer said. “There is no difference between the suffering of Jews, Armenians, Chinese or Cambodians and this creates a global perspective.”
Xu said the presence of the Holocaust in Chinese academia has been increasing since the late 1990s. Since then, the link between these two cultures has become more important.
“There is a universality of this discussion tonight,” said Josh Grossberg, USC Shoah Foundation public communication manager. “They are very different cultures, but they can learn from each other even though they historically may not have mingled.”
“It was a fortuitous circumstance that we had the opportunity to have two of the foremost Holocaust scholars to convene to discuss the challenges of teaching Holocaust education in different political, social and linguistic cultures,” said Dan Leshem, associate director of the USC Shoah Foundation.
Xu was visiting USC to help the Shoah Foundation collect testimonies of the Nanjing Massacre, and Bauer stopped in Los Angeles on his way back to Israel after giving a lecture at the University of Honolulu.
“We were grateful for these circumstances as this would have been very difficult to arrange from scratch,” Leshem said.
Students such as Grace Braun, a freshman majoring in business administration, found that the discussion gave her a new perspective on her Jewish studies class.
“It was very interesting to hear the Chinese perspective on the Holocaust from Xu and hearing how they learn about genocide in general,” Braun said
Students enrolled in the course “The Holocaust” are using one of Brauer’s books as their textbook. Jordan Lieberman, a freshman majoring in economics, enjoyed the opportunity to gain personal insight from the author.
“In the textbook, Brauer writes in a very clinical tone so it was cool to hear more of his personal opinion and how he analyzes different topics,” Lieberman said. “It really made the textbook come to life a little.”
Saul Ortiz, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he was grateful for the opportunity attend the event.
“I gained a lot of knowledge about the topic tonight,” Ortiz said. “I felt it benefited me not just from a history standpoint but also individually because I gained a new perspective.”
Good article—- but you probably should spell Yehuda Bauer’s name correctly……

According to the USC Marshall School of Business’ “How Much Media? 2013 Report on American Consumers,” it is estimated that the average American will consume 15.5 hours of media per day in 2015, and the total amount of U.S. consumption adds up to more than 1.7 trillion hours throughout the entire year.
The report, produced by the Institute for Communication Technology Management at the Marshall School and CTM visiting researcher James E. Short, said that the amount of data delivered to the United States annually will surpass 8.75 zettabytes, or approximately 74 gigabytes of data per person per day.
In other words, the average consumer will receive approximately nine DVDs worth of data daily in and out of the home, excluding media consumed in the workplace.
“As a society, media just dominates how we get our news, how we communicate, everything,” said Vanessa Wilkins, a junior majoring in print and digital journalism who is also a staff reporter for the Daily Trojan.
In the study, Short analyzed publicly released data in more than 30 different categories, including traditional media such as television and radio as well as new digital media such as tablet computers, mobile gaming devices and smartphones.
The report explored the use of these media categories from 2008 to 2015, calculating exposure to the media measured in time, and data flow measured in bytes.
But the time and amount of media that consumers pay attention to and comprehend is more difficult to measure, Short said. The number of hours is also much smaller.
“If you added up the amount of time people are requesting media service, like turning on the TV, plus the time for delivery of that service, like turning on my computer, not whether people are actually using them, you get the 15.5 hours,” Short said.
From 2008 to 2012, the study reported that hours of requested media service grew 5 percent each year as a result of both an increase in population and an increase in the average individual’s daily media intake from 11 hours to 14 hours.
“The takeaway from these numbers is the fact that these devices are just becoming much more capable,” Short said. “So the amount of media flow that people are going to be presented with for the amount of time will be much greater.”
Mobile computers are the most rapidly growing segment in media bytes, accounting for approximately 3 percent of all bytes in 2008 and almost 10 percent in 2013.
Catherine von Handorff, a senior majoring in English, said she is guilty of contributing to this increase.
“The media I consume the most would be articles on my computer. I always end up opening too many tabs,” von Handorff said. “The other night I had over 80 tabs open.”
But there are many concerns regarding the deeper impact of high consumption rates. Some believe reliance on media can hinder a person’s social skills.
“In some aspects [media is problematic] chiefly because it limits our face-to-face interactions.,” von Handorff said. “You can also say that the media that we consume does shape us, but I think it limits us.”
Others were concerned about how these high rates of media usage affect Americans’ physical health.
“We’re spending more time in solitary or a confined spot, instead of going out and experiencing nature, I guess,” said Veronica Cavazos, a senior majoring in psychology. “[Media consumption] should be decreased.”
Short said he sees the transformation of technology as an opportunity.
“We’re leading our communications revolution with technologies,” Short said. “The social institutions that come about follow the technology. We’re at an important transition point where we can begin to use these technologies in a way that will be new.”

USC Student Affairs released a letter Monday to the student body outlining the conclusions reached in a forum on alcohol consumption.
On Oct. 29, more than 200 students attended a town hall forum to discuss the campus culture around alcohol. On Nov. 2, 15 student leaders from student government, Greek life, resident life and student health assessed possible solutions for longer than six hours in conjunction with administrators.
“None of those ideas we drilled down deep enough into an evaluative process,” Vice Provost of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry said. “Our focus was to identity the issue. At this time, we do not have specifics.”
Student leaders and administrators presented some of these strategies for changing the drinking culture on campus in the letter. Alcohol education and social policy need to be changed, the letter said.
“We left [the letter] vague on purpose to make sure we weren’t making promises but we also wanted to let people know exactly what’s going on,” Interfraternity Council President Ofek Lavian said.
Lavian said a group of leaders and administrators will meet again within the next week to revisit the issue and come up with more pragmatic solutions.
Short-term and long-term strategies to reduce binge drinking were also discussed. Possible short-term changes included sending letters to parents before freshman year to discuss how best to approach the issue with their childhood. Solutions discussed included instituting a two-unit freshman course that focused on responsible drinking to build a new structure where students can socialize after 10 p.m.
Lavian and Panhellenic Council President Roxie Friberg agreed that the existing university social events policy, which has not been altered since 1992, needs to be revisited. Currently, weekday events on campus are prohibited after 10 p.m.
“We want to make sure that we’re consistent in allowing those non-alcoholic events to happen and removing barriers from that happening,” Carry said.
Lavian said he personally believes that by banning university-sanctioned social events during the week and  limiting social events off campus, students will act out on Thursdays.
“Students bottle up all of this and [let it] out one night on Thursday,” Lavian said. “That’s an aggressive drinking environment.”
Friberg agreed that Thursday night partying is the crux of the issue.
“The drinking culture is established on Thursday night,” Friberg said. “I think the best way would be to re-examine the Thursday night policy rule. We want to make a policy where everything you’re doing is in line with university policy. We really want to see registration on Thursdays for any club on campus.”
Changing policy, however, could take weeks, if not months.
“I don’t think this is just going to go away. The language of the school addressing this issue as a whole needs to change,” Friberg said. “We need a non-abstinence approach to alcohol policy. A lot of administrators understand that, too. We need to find a way to say it’s illegal to drink under 21, but it’s going to happen and this is how to be safe.”
Carry agreed that the university needs to re-evaluate its stance while still following California law.
“We want to be consistent with the law but we know that students are drinking,” he said. “We will never be in a place that we will condone underage drinking.”
The binge drinking culture at the university also extends beyond the Greek system, Lavian pointed out.
“In general, USC has a pervasive drinking culture,” Lavian said. “It resulted in the death of a non-Greek student.”
The group of leaders plans to institute some policies immediately, but others will not be addressed for some time.
“Some of the strategies are easily achievable and have received consensus support by administrators and students, while others require more consideration, as well as time and effort to develop, before implementation in appropriate cases,” said the letter, signed by Carry.
Part of the problem is the type of students that USC attracts, namely heavily tutored wealthy  students who (after massive coaching) score well on standardized tests but didn’t apply themselves in high school consistently enough to be in the top 10 percent if they attended  a very competitive  high school.  These students love to party!  Many of them develop a cocaine habit while attending USC.  To prevent enrolling high numbers of students like this in the future, USC needs to require scores on two SAT subject tests as a condition of entry for all students other than those classified as economically disadvantaged.  SAT subject tests require the kind of knowledge that can only be acquired through months of diligent study.  Students cannot do well on these tests by using Daddy’s money to hire  the finest tutors at the last minute and cram. SAT subject test scores will expose these high-partying students for what they are–vastly overprivileged kids who lack discipline and do not perform well on a sustained basis because they put partying first.  Obviously there will be situations in which USC should admit students who did not score well on SAT subject tests, but those admissions should be limited to students who have excelled consistently for years in an area that shows they are serious about achievement. I’m not suggesting that SAT subject tests are a complete solution but it will definitely help.
Sorry for partying!

Two suspects, Bryan Barnes and Javier Bolden, were charged with the murder of two USC students, as well as various other charges. They pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on Thursday.
Ming Qu and Ying Wu, two 23-year-old international students at USC who were one month away from graduating, were shot on April 11, 2012 while sitting in a BMW on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue south of Adams Boulevard during a botched robbery attempt.
Qu was found dead on the porch of a house, when he tried to get help after being shot, and Wu was found dead in the passenger seat of the car. The incident occurred around 1 a.m.
Barnes, 20, and Bolden, 19, were charged with the murders of the two graduate students. According to reports, the suspects were part of a crime spree that culminated in the shooting. They are also accused of the premeditated murder of Tim Hall and allegedly tried to kill two other people, Zanae Flowers and Deionce Davance, previously. In total, the two are charged with nine felonies.
Last month, a judge ruled that there was enough evidence in the case to proceed and ordered the defendants to stand trial. Prosecutors will decide later whether or not to seek the death penalty.
Barnes and Bolden are due back at court on Jan. 23 for a pretrial hearing.

On Thursday, USC’s Neighborhood Academic Initiative hosted Gene Simmons at the University Club as a guest speaker for 60 students currently in the program.
Path to success · Former KISS star Gene Simmons speaks to Neighborhood Academic Initiative participants at the University Club on Thursday evening about his own experiences facing adversity as an immigrant. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Others in attendance included Pavel Krapivin, vice president of Warner Bros. and former student of the USC Math, Science and Technology High School, and Kim Thomas-Barrio, executive director of NAI.
NAI is a college access and success program with neighborhood students in grades six through 12 in conjunction with the university.
“[This program] allows the academic rigor students need and the support families need for first generation college-goers from underrepresented minority groups,” Thomas-Barrios said.
Since its first graduating class in 1997, NAI has  graduated more than 700 students. Forty percent of those graduates attended USC with a full four-and-a-half year scholarship package, not including loans.
“All of this is in a neighborhood where about 50 percent of the students who attend neighborhood high schools drop out before graduating from high school,” Thomas-Barrios said.
Thomas-Barrios said the decision to have Gene Simmons speak to a group of NAI students was an easy one for her and colleagues, who knew that students could relate well to Simmons, who immigrated to the United States from Israel with his mother when he was only 9 years old.
“I am you; you are me,” Simmons said. “I wasn’t born here … when I first came to the United States of America, I heard the words, ‘What are you, stupid? Can’t you speak English?’”
Simmons, like many of the students at the USC magnet schools, did not speak English as a first language. Simmons encouraged every student to do what he did: work as hard as possible each and every day, rather than giving up in the face of adversity.
“When you take a look at the most powerful people in the world, they’re not the prettiest, they’re not the tallest … they may not be the smartest. They worked the hardest,” Simmons said.
Pavel Krapivin, a colleague of Simmons’ and a former student of Thomas-Barrios’, was also able to relate to the current students of NAI as an immigrant who did not speak English as his first language, but taught it to himself by reading science textbooks.
Krapivin, who attended USC after high school, has stayed close to NAI and his former professor and principal. His success story is one of the many inspirations current NAI students have.
“When the school opened, I wanted to come here to learn, and I am very happy to come back here because all of you are going to do great things and once you do, you’ll want to give back,” Krapivin told the students. “It feels good to come back and to do things for other people.”
Simmons, known for his role in the rock band KISS, encouraged students to ignore unsupportive people and to always believe that they are extraordinary.
“Anybody that makes you feel bad, get rid of them — get them out of your life,” Simmons said. “You don’t have time for them, because they’re just vampires — they’re going to suck the life out of you.”
One of the things Simmons emphasized to the students was that nobody was stopping them from succeeding except themselves.
“All the information in the world, finally, for the first time in history, is available to you and to the richest and the most powerful, for free. … There’s nothing preventing you from scaling the heights — nothing — except you. All the opportunity you’ve got here, you’ve got to take advantage of it.”
As a kid I Rocked and Rolled All Nite and partied every day. As an adult I worked for many companies always leaving unfulfilled. I did what no one told me I could do, I started a business with the help of my wonderful supportive wife. Together we have grown our business to a wonderful success. we did it by surrounding ourselves with people that were more successful than ourselves, people that supported us, people that believed in us. The same principals that Mr. Simmons speaks. Just because you don’t have a degree in something, doesn’t mean that you can’t be successful. You just have to be hungry. We have often heard that if you go to school you will get a good job. Nonsense! Go to school to start a business and then hire the folks that want a job. Do something that you love and you will never have to work another day in your life.
Wonderful article very inspiring.thank you

The USC men’s water polo team will be joining the rest of the Trojan community this weekend as they head to Berkeley, Calif. for a premier matchup against the No. 5-ranked Golden Bears on Saturday.
Spotlight · Senior goalie James Clark is allowing just 5.78 goals per game this season, but has allowed 10 goals in USC’s last two matches. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The clash will be a battle of top-five teams, even as the Trojans (20-2, 2-1) enter the game having dropped down to a tie for second in the nation with UCLA following their 10-6 loss against Pacific last week.
Meanwhile, the Golden Bears (14-5, 3-2) have had an impressive season thus far but have struggled against the top competition they have faced, with losses to No. 2 UCLA, No. 1 Pacific and No. 4 Stanford.
Still, Cal will serve as one of the Trojans’ biggest challenges to date, especially coming off of an emotional loss against the Tigers in which USC struggled throughout the game to find some rhythm.
“We just have to prepare for the rest of the teams,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said after the loss. “There is only one other team we’ve lost to, and all the losses were at the top.”
The matchup with Pacific might have been the Trojans’ rowdiest game all year, as the Stockton-based school brought in more than 1,300 fans.
Vavic’s squad should be expecting another boisterous environment in Berkeley, conditions that the Hall of Fame coach is certainly looking forward to.
“Some of the younger players do get nervous,” Vavic said of the idea of playing in front of raucous crowds. “Hopefully, they learn from it.”
The five-time defending champions are currently half a game behind Pacific, UCLA and Stanford for the top spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. All three foes boast a 3-1 conference record while USC has one less MPSF victory. As the season progresses, that should be a race that will come down to the wire, and the Trojans could do themselves a big favor with a win over the Bears.
In recent memory, the Trojans have dominated their counterparts from the Bay, having won their last four matchups with Cal. Historically, however, USC-Cal has been one of the most even series in the country, with USC leading the all-time series by the slimmest of margins (53-52-2).
Still, Vavic’s team has been setting a variety of records lately — though not all of them have been positive.
The loss to Pacific was the first defeat against the Tigers since 2002. Earlier in the season, the Trojans fell to UCLA to snap a 41-game win streak. Incidentally, the loss to the Bruins happened in Berkeley’s home pool, as it occurred during the championship match of the NorCal Tournament.
On a positive note, this season the Trojans have been collectively playing fairly good defense, giving up just a shade more than five goals per game.
Still, Vavic expects more of his club defensively since the Trojans have allowed 10 goals in consecutive matches for the first time this season. The need to improve defensively, and going that extra mile, has been a constant theme of the past few weeks.
“Water polo is such a game of inches that if you are a little late, you’re going to give up a goal,” Vavic said. “A couple of rebounds, a couple of feet, that’s the difference.”
Cal’s offense boasts junior Aleksa Saponjic and senior Collin Smith, both of whom average more than a goal and a half per game. USC will have to bank on the defensive effort they’ve put forth in practice since losing to Pacific if they want to walk out of their 10 a.m. showdown at Spieker Aquatics Complex (and over to the football game) victorious.
The game will also offer both programs a rare shot at television exposure, as it will be televised on the Pac-12 Networks.

The Women of Troy opened the season last weekend with a triumphant 73-38 exhibition win against Westmont — and even though the blowout win won’t count toward the standings, it might have been exactly what the Women of Troy needed coming off a disappointing 2012-13 season.
Sparkplug · Junior guard Ariya Crook earned Pac-12 All Honorable Mention last season after emerging as USC’s second leading scorer with 13.4 points per game. Crook was also was second in assists (2.9 apg) and steals (1.2 spg). – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (11-20) finished seventh overall in the Pac-12 and missed the NCAA Tournament for the seventh consecutive year, leading to the resignation of former coach Michael Cooper. The program’s future looked uncertain before a former Trojan emerged to provide a glimmer of hope.
New coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke’s career has come full circle after winning two NCAA championships at USC as a player in the 1980s before going on to win an Olympic gold medal and four WNBA titles. With last season behind them, USC’s veteran-studded roster now seems ready to bounce back under Cooper-Dyke, who has injected a sense of energy into her team much like her male counterpart has for the Trojans.
“I’m excited to be back, excited for the challenge,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I think we have a great group of young women and I think they’re motivated. And as a coaching staff, we’re equally motivated, if not more.”
But it’ll take more than enthusiasm to win games in the stacked Pac-12, and the one player poised to lead the Women of Troy on the stat sheet and in the huddle is senior forward Cassie Harberts.
Harberts’ stats are undeniable. Last season she made the All Pac-12 team after leading the Women of Troy in points per game (18.0), rebounds per game (8.2) and blocks (34). Her outstanding play has earned her a long list of preseason accolades. This offseason, Harberts was named to the John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 30 list along with being selected as a finalist for the 2014 Senior CLASS Award.
Harberts is currently the No. 16 all-time scorer at USC with 1,293 career points, and has started every game for the Women of Troy while she’s played at Troy. She will likely go down in USC history among the great women’s basketball players to come out of the program including her new head coach Cooper-Dyke, WNBA stars Tina Thompson and Lisa Leslie.
Harberts is also in good company among her talented teammates, with the Women of Troy returning all but one player to their roster with the lone graduation of forward Christina Marinacci.
Sophomore guard Jordan Adams, a former McDonald’s All-American, is set to return after playing only eight games last year before being sidelined by an injury.
Along with Adams, the backcourt should have great depth with dynamic sophomore guard Brianna Barrett and junior guard Ariya Crook also earning plenty of minutes. Last season, Crook earned All Pac-12 Honorable Mention while Barrett received Pac-12 All-Defensive Honorable Mention and Pac-12 All-Freshman Honorable Mention.
Between the leadership of seniors Desireé Bradley, Kate Oliver, Rachel Totten and Harberts and the addition of transfers forward Kaneisha Horn and guard Alexis Lloyd, the Women of Troy should have little trouble replacing the leadership and defensive tenacity of Marinacci.
Lloyd is a transfer from Virginia Tech who will have to sit out this season. Horn, on the other hand, is a junior transfer from Alabama who hopes to make an impact immediately.
Horn will play this season as a versatile forward and has two seasons of eligibility remaining.
The Women of Troy will face a challenging set of foes on their redemption campaign under Cooper-Dyke. The squad will play eight teams that made it to the NCAA Tournament last year and 12 teams that were either ranked or received votes in the final national polls last season.
USC’s season kicks off this weekend up north against two teams that the Women of Troy have some unfinished business with — UC Davis and Fresno State.
The Aggies trumped the Women of Troy at the Galen Center last season 78-69. After beating USC last season, however, the Aggies stumbled to a similarly tumultuous 12-18 season.
Both teams have something to prove in the opener, and the Aggies have a weapon that could present some real problems for USC. Junior forward Sydnee Fipps was named All-Big West first team after finishing second in the conference in scoring (17.1 points per game) last season. The Women of Troy will have to contain her spot-up shot if they want to redeem last season’s home-court loss.
USC will round out its first road trip at Fresno State, who defeated the Women of Troy 65-60 in Fresno last season to even the all-time series between the two programs at 5-5. The Bulldogs figure to be one of the toughest opponents the Women of Troy will face all season.
Last season, the Bulldogs (24-9) won the 2013 Mountain West tournament championship title, earning a berth to the NCAA Tournament as a No. 15 seed before losing to California. Fresno State has been picked to win its second consecutive conference title in the preseason poll.
As Cooper-Dyke sets to begin her first season as coach at her alma mater, her expectations are tempered yet optimistic.
“We just want to take it one game, one practice at a time and really be the best women’s basketball team that we can possibly be,” Cooper-Dyke said. “That’s the goal: Be our best. We don’t want to allow ourselves to underachieve.”
If the Women of Troy are determined to avoid underachieving and earn a berth to the NCAA Tournament, it’s hard to imagine a better start than defeating two teams that contributed to last season’s disappointing campaign.

USC doesn’t throw out some cartoon, costumed mascot on the football field like many other colleges. Instead, Tommy Trojan rides his noble steed Traveler around the field to pump up the crowd. And the pair often succeeds in rousing the Coliseum after each USC touchdown.
The basketball team, however, appears to be going in a different direction — and not just because there’s no room for Traveler to gallop around the Galen Center.
On Wednesday, USC unveiled the new Tommy Trojan and Traveler, a more kid-friendly version of the mascot with full-on cartoon costumes. The new mascots will be cheering from the Galen Center every home game for both the men’s and women’s basketball team.
The mascot change in itself is not a major development in USC athletics, but sparks a greater discussion that the basketball team has clearly answered and the football team will be asked at the end of this current season: What’s next?
USC men’s basketball comes into its season opener today at Utah State with a drastically different-looking program from last season. The biggest change of course is new head coach Andy Enfield, the high-flying bundle of energy taken from Florida Gulf Coast to lead this year’s team.
Enfield led Florida Gulf Coast University to the Sweet Sixteen of last year’s NCAA Division I National Championship tournament. Florida Gulf Coast had easily the maddest run of March Madness — well, save for maybe Kevin Ware’s right fibula. The Eagles came into the tournament as a No. 15 seed and shocked the No. 2-seeded Georgetown Hoyas, then upset the 7-seeded San Diego State Aztecs before ultimately falling to          No. 3-seeded Florida.
The Eagles used a fast-paced style, pushing transition whenever possible and avoiding set 5-on-5 half-court possessions, and had arguably the best dunkers in the tournament.
USC basketball, on the other hand, spent all of March Madness on the couch. For the second year in a row, the men’s team didn’t qualify for the 68-team tournament. The team finished 14-18 overall with a slightly more respectable 9-9 finish in Pac-12 play. Former head coach Kevin O’Neill was fired midway through the year after going 6-26 the year before with only one win and 17 losses in conference play. Former interim head coach Bob Cantu did well to prevent the season from becoming another complete failure like the year before, but the team still missed the tournament.
Athletic Director Pat Haden obviously wanted to make a splash in the coaching market to see if that would turn things around in the Galen Center. So the Trojans made Enfield a contract offer he could not refuse — no surprise that USC has a little more financial support behind its storied athletic program than Florida Gulf Coast — and fans have been anxiously waiting to see the new look of the team ever since.
Enfield isn’t the only change to this year’s basketball team. Since Enfield was announced as the new head coach, several noteworthy players have transferred to USC, including former Maryland point guard Pe’Shon Howard, former UNLV shooting guard Katin Reinhardt and former Charlotte forward Darion Clark. Though the new players might not be enough for USC to legitimately compete for the Pac-12 title just yet, the surge of player interest since the new hire shows how much a coach can influence the recruiting process.
The question Enfield will have to answer is if an exciting new recruiting pitch is enough to change the program’s dynamics. Will March Madness become a rite of passage for USC basketball players every year like it is for schools such as Duke, UNC, Louisville or even UCLA? Is transitioning to a fun style of play all that it will take to build some tradition around USC basketball?
It’s the same question USC football will have to address at the end of the season. Unlike Enfield’s squad, the Trojans who compete in the Coliseum already have a lot of tradition to build on. But recent struggles beg the question of whether or not a team needs something more in today’s game.
Should USC bring in a football coach that can run a spread offense? Is the traditional pro-style offense that won USC two Heismans and two national titles (insert NCAA sanction joke here) from 2004 to 2005 too old-school? Can USC rely on its tradition, or does it need to change the face of the football program with a new coach, new offense and even a new costumed mascot?
The pro-style offense is the same style that legendary head coach John McKay relied on to mold USC into a national power long before Pete Carroll came and built upon the tradition. But today, so many teams are replacing traditional offenses with no-huddle, hurry-up, pass-heavy, dual-threat quarterback offenses because the system is both much more fun to watch and much more fun to play, regardless of any real strategic benefit that such a system could bring.
Interim head football coach Ed Orgeron has shown on the football field that the right coach can certainly make a huge difference just by bringing a bunch of new energy, even if most of the style of play stays the same. Maybe the basketball team didn’t need to totally change the team’s style of play, and just needed to bring in more enthusiasm at the head coaching position.
USC has some time before it has to answer all of the football team’s big questions. For now, Trojan fans can finally start enjoying one of the greatest times in all of USC sports, when the tail end of football season overlaps with the beginning of basketball season and fans have twice as many games to watch.
And since the basketball team tips off tonight at Utah State, the Trojan faithful won’t have to wait long to see if a new coach — or mascot — on the court is all the program needs to kick-start a streak of success to rival that of their counterparts on the football field.

In signing new head coach Andy Enfield away from Florida Gulf Coast University on April 1, Athletic Director Pat Haden hoped that the splashy hire would turn around a men’s basketball program in dire need of an injection of excitement. After being overshadowed by crosstown rival UCLA for years, Haden’s hire of Enfield was at least more successful in building buzz than the Bruins’ tabbing of Steve Alford.

Friday will be the first chance to see if the new-look Trojans can carry over that success to the court. USC heads to Logan, Utah to take on Utah State in their first regular-season game under Enfield on Friday at 6:05 p.m.
Enfield will look to become the second coach in USC’s history to win his first game as head coach, with Kevin O’Neill in the 2009-2010 season being the only one to accomplish that feat. Enfield hopes to continue his past coaching success, which begins and ends with being the first coach in NCAA history to lead a No. 15 seed to the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament, in one of the strongest top-to-bottom conferences in college basketball.
“I want our players to be confident and think about what they’re doing now, not what happened in the past,” Enfield said. “As far as the old coaching staff, I give them a lot of credit because we have very good players on our team. I understand the nature of this business. Sometimes there is change, and I walked into a situation where there was change. So I’m very sensitive to that, but also I want our players to focus on the future and what we’re trying to do right now.”
USC finished last year with a 14-18 record, including 9-9 in Pac-12 play, an improvement after finishing 6-26 and setting a school record for losses the season before. The team had big conference wins over UCLA and Arizona on the road, as well as a 7-8 record after O’Neill’s firing on Jan. 15, giving a glimpse of a team ready to turn things around.
Despite the big coaching change, the Trojans are projected to finish 11th in an extremely deep Pac-12, ahead of only Washington State. The Pac-12 features three teams ranked in the AP Top 25 in No. 6 Arizona, No. 19 Oregon and No. 22 UCLA, while Colorado, Arizona State, Washington and Stanford all received votes.
“Most of our team is new anyways, so no one knows anything about our players, and no one knows how we’re going to play,” senior center Omar Oraby said about the projections. “We have a whole new coaching staff and a whole new style, so that doesn’t really mean anything to us because no one knows anything about us yet.”
USC’s nonconference schedule is a little more manageable after their game against the Aggies, but still features games against Villanova and Boston College, which both received votes in the AP poll. The most interesting date on the nonconference schedule will be Nov. 29, when the Trojans could potentially square off against No. 5 Kansas in the Bahamas in the Battle 4 Atlantis Tournament. The Jayhawks also made a big splash in the offseason by signing No. 1 recruit and projected No. 1 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, Andrew Wiggins.
“We have a challenging schedule right now,” Enfield said. “Our first game is probably one of the toughest games on our schedule.”
The Aggies finished last season with a 21-10 record, finishing fourth in the Western Athletic Conference with an 11-7 record. They lost 83-78 in the WAC Quarterfinals to UT Arlington in their final season in the WAC, and are now playing in the Mountain West Conference for the first time. The Aggies are slated to finish fourth in the Mountain West this year in the preseason media poll, which projects well for Utah State since the conference sent five teams to the NCAA tournament last season.
“They’re a great team,” senior guard Pe’shon Howard said about the Aggies. “They’re picked second in the Mountain West, so people know about them. They’re a very experienced team and they can shoot the lights out.”
Utah State returns its top three scorers from last season, led by guard Preston Medlin’s 16.3 points per game. Center Jarred Shaw averaged 14.2 points per game and led the team with 8.4 rebounds per game, while swingman Spencer Butterfield averaged 12.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.
“It’s a tough way to start the season, but as a basketball player, this is why you come to ’SC, for big games,” Howard said. “That’s a great way to start our season off and just take advantage of the opportunity.”
USC is 6-4 all-time against the Aggies, with a 52-50 loss in the Maui Invitational in 1999 being their last contest.
“Utah State’s an experienced team with a lot of seniors and juniors,” Enfield said. “They’re one of the best teams on our schedule, regardless of what conference they’re in. We have our hands full. They win about 90 percent of their home games, and they have one of the best coaches in the country.”
Their coach, Stew Morrill, has a record of 324-103 (.759) in 15 seasons with the Aggies, including a 193-13 (.937) record at home.
After their match against the Aggies, the Trojans will return to the Galen Center for a four-game homestand. They’ll play their home opener on Tuesday at 8 p.m. against Cal State Northridge, followed by matchups against Northern Arizona on Nov. 15 at 8 p.m., Cal State Fullerton on Nov. 19 at 8 p.m. and West Alabama on Nov. 21 at 7 p.m.

There are plenty of successful film franchises, and plenty of superhero movies. Thor: The Dark World, coming out this weekend, certainly fits both of these categories. This film fits into a superhero franchise of a scope and ambition unlike anything we have seen before in the film industry.
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an undertaking that, since the release of the first film, Iron Man, in 2008, has produced seven films with a combined budget of over $1.2 billion, with Thor: The Dark World being the eighth. That is massive, even in this sequel-happy age. Massive not only in the scope of the movies but in the ambition and vision required for this project to be made. This approach has been so successful, in fact, that we can already see other groups attempting to mimic it. It would be dangerous to think, however, that this formula would work for every fictional universe, as even Marvel is evolving the formula before audiences’ eyes.
In 2005, Marvel set up its own production studio to produce films based on its material and distribute them through Paramount. They had licensed out some of their properties, such as X-Men, Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk, to other studios in the past and had received little from those investments in terms of profits. So, to improve their position in the film industry, they took matters into their own hands. Their approach to the material was much different from anything else that had been previously attempted. Marvel sought to first establish film franchises based on individual characters (such as Iron Man, Spiderman and Thor), and then eventually combine them into one super-production.
Before this effort, film franchises were developed one at a time, most of them without the promise of a sequel to follow the first installment. It just wasn’t feasible to plan such large endeavors without knowing for sure if they would be successful. Marvel planned five movies off the bat, based on characters that were well-known, but by no means as famous as Batman or Superman.
Iron Man came first, and though Marvel had much larger ambitions in store, if the endeavor proved a failure, all the other ideas would have likely been scrapped. Fortunately for Marvel Studios (and millions of moviegoers), Iron Man was a smashing success. Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 2, even the not-so-successful Incredible Hulk (whose licensing they managed to get back), all led up to the culmination that was 2012’s The Avengers. That film confirmed that Marvel’s plan was genius. Directed by sci-fi god Joss Whedon, it was a resounding success and became the third-highest grossing film of all time.
Marvel’s strategy worked wonderfully, and it continues now into “phase two” of their strategy. Iron Man 3, another roaring financial success, was the first installment in this next step and Thor: The Dark World follows it. All told, the plan going forward is to continue the individual established franchises, the Captain America sequel, The Winter Soldier, is coming next year, while building up to another Avengers extravaganza in 2015.
This phase also marks the expansion of Marvel’s scope. While in the process of building up to another combination picture, Marvel is also expanding horizontally by creating films for more franchises. Guardians of the Galaxy is set to be released next year, and is based on source material much more obscure than any of the Avengers. An Ant-Man film has been confirmed for 2015 and projects for Black Panther, Dr. Strange and The Inhumans have all been discussed, if not outright confirmed to be in development. Only die-hard comic book fans are familiar with these characters and the viability of movies based on such obscure stories would have seemed heretical even a few years ago.
It still sounds a bit crazy now. Disney’s John Carter, a film based on more obscure source material, bombed in the box office last year. But Marvel is playing a different game than everyone else. They have established a powerful film empire and they are able to see the possibilities that come with it. All these films will tie into the Avengers universe and fans who are hooked on the main story will flock to see the continuation of the universe.
By successfully creating this universe, Marvel is now able to explore the depths of its creative material in ways that few entities ever have. DC Comics, the eternal counterpart to Marvel, is woefully behind in this respect. Despite the advantage of having all their properties under one roof at Warner Bros., they have been completely unable to replicate Marvel’s success — with the massive exception of Christopher Nolan’s now-concluded Dark Knight trilogy. DC also has a comparable superhero team in the Justice League that, in theory, would compete with the Avengers. DC also has recognition on its side: the members of the Justice League (Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, to name a few) are far more iconic than those of The Avengers.
But the strategy Marvel executed is a very difficult one, and a very ambitious one to follow. Warner Bros. has failed in its attempts to match it so far, and the Superman-Batman movie due to come out in 2015 (directly competing with the Avengers) will mark their most ambitious foray into the “connected superhero franchises film” arena. The only other “universe” that has promised to use a similar formula is the only other one with both the immense scope and the backing of Disney dollars to pull it off: Star Wars. Their proposed strategy of alternating individual stories with larger combined pictures is distinctly Marvel-esque. Given the success that Marvel universe has had, it’s probably a brilliant move for the galaxy far, far away — provided they have the vision and the resources to actually pull it off.

Looking at the big picture people need to realize overall- DC has more than marvel. The Dark knight trilogy was amazing, the arkham games are the best comic book games ever, their animated movies such as dark knight returns, under the red hood, mask of phantom are critically acclaimed. And comics are still going strong with court of owls and death of the family amoung past masterpieces of watchmen etc
Meanwhile marvel has an overly milked film universe mared by bad films like iron man 2&3 and the first thor and incredible hulk and a terrible tv show
This article has several inaccuracies, although the central argument is sound.
1) Just because Marvel is first to the game does not mean that these other films which they are planning will be successful. I predict that this Guardians of the Galaxy nonsense will be the first flop. I look forward to your article about that.
2) The Avengers are a superhero team comparable to the Justice League, not the other way around. Not only was the Justice League created first, but also it features stronger and more identifiable characters.
3) John Carter is a non-relevant argument.
4) The licensing of the other characters, such as Spider-man, has nothing to do with the creation of Marvel Studios. Instead, they were sold off to other distributors long ago as a result of Marvel’s long-standing historical desire to make movies out of their characters. In fact, the profitability of those other characters is one of the reasons Marvel has not been able to get the rights to those characters back (unlike the Hulk, who was in two crappy movies before Marvel ended up getting them back).
5) Star Wars is also not analogous. It is already the quintessential successful movie franchise (if not in actual quality, then in precedence). Unlike the Avengers, there is already a base of several films and characters for which Disney does not need to seriously make a new film franchise and spin off endless amounts of toys for five year olds who think Jar Jar Binks is the coolest thing ever. Star Wars is much less of a gamble than the Marvel movies.

Six years ago Rebecca Marie Gomez, also known as Becky G, went through a midlife crisis. Midlife crisis, the musician said, of course, the term is relative to her current age — 16 years old.
Spanglish · Singer Becky G spoke with professor Josh Kun’s communication class, COMM 307: “Sound Class: Popular Music and American Culture” about growing up in Inglewood, Calif. and the importance of her roots and connecting with Latin American culture in her music. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
After her parents lost their home, she and her five other family members moved into her grandparents’ converted garage — making Becky G “one of six in a garage the size of a bedroom,” she said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
She started to think about what she could do to get out of there.
“My way of doing that was music,” she said.
And despite her family struggles and young age, the 5-foot tall peppy singer and rapper has made her way into the music industry, recently releasing her debut single and music video, “Becky from the Block.”
On Thursday, Becky G, the Mexican-American hip-hop singer, songwriter, rapper and dancer from Inglewood, Calif., came to speak to professor Josh Kun’s communication class, COMM 307: “Sound Clash: Popular Music and American Culture.”
Kun, who had been a fan of Becky G’s ever since he saw her “Becky from the Block” music video, thought her presence would be especially inspiring in a class centered around issues of identity, race and ethnicity within pop music.
“I was very impressed by the fact that somebody so young seems so clear about how she is representing herself as a young Mexican-American woman,” Kun said.
During the lecture, Becky G spoke to students about breaking into the industry, growing up, the importance of family and what goes into making music videos. Despite describing crazy situations as “bananas” and sparingly using other colloquial language, the young musician appeared composed and profound, as she discussed important topics such as heritage, belonging and identity in music.
Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano in the Division of Student Affairs since 2005, described Becky G as “extremely articulate yet dope and down all at the same time.”
“At 16, I loved how she presented herself, her love for her hood ‘Inglewood,’ her family, and her Mexican roots, which is visible in all her videos. I and many others can truly relate,” Vela said in an email.
Becky G credits her maturity to her experiences growing up.
“A part of the reason why I am so mature, I feel, is because of the way I was brought up and [because of] the hardships of my family,” Becky G said. As the oldest sibling of four, she often had to step up and take on a leadership role in her family. “Mentally, I had to get my stuff together,” she said.
After her family lost their home, 9-year-old Becky G began to think about what she wanted to do with her life — and her mind went in one direction: She wanted to be an entertainer.
For six months, with her parents’ permission, Becky G began to act in commercials and short films. She picked up work wherever she could, handing over money to her family to help pay the bills.
Meanwhile, she did covers and remixes of songs, posting them onto YouTube. In 2011, she posted a cover of Kanye West and Jay Z’s song, “Otis,” in which she rapped 30 bars in a row. Despite the video having what she called a “bro budget,” she nevertheless caught the attention of Dr. Luke, who signed Becky G to his Sony Music Entertainment label, Kemosabe Records.
“I feel lucky. YouTube has become such an amazing platform for people to share their talents. There are still so many underdiscovered talents waiting to be found,” she said in yesterday’s lecture.
Now, Becky G does all she can to represent her culture and her city in the most honest, way possible.
In fact, “Becky from the Block” tells Becky G’s story, including her time at Inglewood Elementary School, her trips to the local Kelso market and her 30 uncles who will chase any boy who tries to date her.
“No matter where I go / I know where I came from,” she repeats over and over in the song.
In her music and videos, she constantly references her family’s past and the struggles she has endured to get where she is.
“It’s okay to be proud of where you come from — it was very natural for me to do that,” she said during the lecture.
“I am Mexican-American. It is part of me and it is in my blood. I even speak Spanglish.”
At the end of the day, her career’s goal is to relate to the Mexican-American community. Vela reiterated that he is very impressed with how Becky G represents her Mexican roots.
“She is well grounded and representing our community extremely well,” Vela said in an email.
Moreover, she works hard to represent Latin America in a positive and authentic way.
“All of Latin America is now adapting to the American culture — and we speak Spanglish. We speak English, Spanish and Spanglish,” she said in the lecture. And that reflects in how she chose to represent herself asone of the faces of Covergirl.
“It’s like making a potion,” she said in class. “I always make sure in everything I do, there is always that little flick of Becky G.”
Not only does she constantly refer to her heritage and past, but Becky G also makes many references to her family.
“There is nothing bigger in life than to have a good relationship with your parents,” she said during the lecture. She went on to compare her parents to bumper lanes in bowling — constantly keeping her within the lines.
Her grandparents moved to the United States so her family could have a better life; thus, she works hard to prove to them that they were successful.
“[My family] came here for a better life. Me doing things in my career is showing them that they really did it,” Becky G told the class.
And when she’s not singing, dancing, rapping or writing, she is doling out mature advice such as, “Learn to not take every opportunity that comes your way,” or, “Have respect for yourself and don’t exploit yourself.”
Respecting oneself can be difficult in an industry that encourages artists to fit into a marketable mold.
“There is a lot of pressure to be perfect … There is a box that [the music industry wants] you to stay in. And I’m kind of, like, I’m going to stretch out of the box a little bit,” she said in the lecture.
Kun, who was already expecting Becky G to be charming and smart, had no idea what he was in for when he invited her to come speak to the class.
“I don’t think I was ready for just how thoughtful and profoundly intelligent she is. She possesses the maturity and smarts of someone far older than she is,” Kun told the Daily Trojan. “I have interviewed lots and lots of artists, and it’s rare that I am this impressed with somebody who is this young. [She is] authentic and honest, but also smart — really smart. I could listen to her talk for a long time.”
And despite being praised for her outstanding maturity, Becky G still strongly believes in a college education. She wants to study business, possibly at USC.
“School is what gets you everywhere,” she said. “My closet is filled with Trojan stuff. It is really special for me to come here today.”

A salute to the undervalued efforts of casting directors, Tom Donahue’s new HBO documentary Casting By celebrates the gutsy, eagle-eyed iconoclasts whose intuition defied old Hollywood typecasting and gave rise to the age of the unconventional movie star.
Skirting the seedier side of the audition process, the film instead throws the spotlight on Marion Dougherty, a trailblazing New York casting director who carved out her own niche in the industry while jumpstarting the careers of acting legends such as Clint Eastwood, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Jon Voight and Robert Redford, all of whom appear in the film to reminisce about the woman who gave them some of their earliest breaks. Dougherty, who died in 2011, remains feisty and insightful in Donahue’s interviews, pouring over mountains of faded headshots with an expression usually reserved for proud mothers.
A would-be actress who fell into her profession nearly by accident, Dougherty began her career on NBC’s Kraft productions, where she used her theater-honed instincts to spot the seeds of greatness in everyone from James Dean to Warren Beatty. One of the movie’s funniest moments comes from a Kraft Television Theatre outtake showing Beatty shamelessly imitating Marlon Brando’s mush-mouthed delivery before Dougherty convinces the future Bonnie and Clyde star to try enunciating instead.
Before long, renowned filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen were knocking on her door, depending on the matronly maven to supply their new projects with the city’s most talented up-and-comers. Allen, who detests auditioning actors, jokingly insists that Dougherty and her all-female casting company saved him a fortune in hand sanitizer. Scorsese is even more generous, at one point saying that casting constitutes 90 percent of the work when it comes to filmmaking.
Casting By also harkens back to a brief, glorious period when talent trumped good looks in Hollywood, at least for male performers. As Dougherty herself says, she and her cohorts were looking for actors, not movie stars. Dustin Hoffman’s groundbreaking turn in 1967’s classic The Graduate ushered in a whole new era of non-traditional leading men, from the rumpled ire of Gene Hackman in The French Connection to Gene Wilder’s sardonic, bug-eyed candy magnate in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Under the old studio system, the majority of these actors would have been typecast as thugs or one-note comic sidekicks. Dougherty and other influential casting directors allowed performers the chance to display their range, even while certain executives longed for the days of safe, bankable uniformity.
Dougherty’s West Coast counterpart Lynn Stalmaster, one of the first casting directors to ever receive credit during a film’s opening titles, also features prominently here. Stalmaster, whose Nebraska-born modesty prevents him from admitting that he ever “discovered” anyone, was instrumental in launching the careers of John Travolta — helping him to secure a part on the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter — and Bette Midler, who was so desperate to escape Hawaii’s musical theater scene that she begged Stalmaster to cast her in a non-speaking role as a Christian missionary in the 1966 Julie Andrews vehicle Hawaii, the paycheck from which allowed her to book a flight to New York City and start her career.
In addition to the interviews and fascinating archival footage, Casting By makes a rather compelling case for establishing a new Oscar category for casting directors (it’s the only main title credit not currently recognized by the Academy). In doing so, Donahue also reveals a bizarre, apparently ancient rivalry that exists between casting directors and the Directors Guild of America. Taylor Hackford, current Guild President and the director of Ray and The Devil’s Advocate, serves as the film’s de facto villain, belittling the casting process and scoffing at the idea of a separate Oscar — including an honorary one for Dougherty. He even takes issue with their use of the word “director,” saying the title should only apply to filmmakers.
Entertaining, breezily paced and endlessly informative, Casting By should be considered essential viewing for any aspiring actor or curious cinephile. Even if you don’t care about the history of the profession itself, the celebrity anecdotes are definitely worth a watch, especially young Voight’s paranoid conviction that his over-the-top performance in an episode of Naked City would be enough to sour Dougherty on the acting skills of his entire generation. He needn’t have worried. Marion Dougherty always saw the best in people, often in ways that made cinematic history.

With Call of Duty: Ghosts out this week, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag released just a week ago and Grand Theft Auto V still breaking records, it’s a great moment for the video game industry. And with the holiday season fast approaching, video game companies will see a surge in profits.
But as people plan their holiday shopping, some individuals will try to convince people to be careful of what they purchase because these violence-based video games will have a negative effect on the consumer. Some anti-gaming advocates will go as far as to say video game content should be completely censored.
Politicians, news media and overly concerned citizens tend to point at video games as the bane of Western civilization, even though these titles are available in most of the world and don’t receive the venomous rhetoric abroad that they receives here. The GTA franchise alone has been blamed for everything from Columbine to Virginia Tech and future tragedies will likely be connected back to it. To this day, there has been no definite correlation between the violence in media and the violent tendencies of an individual. In fact, a study done just recently at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Charite University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus in Berlin seems to indicate that video games may lead to increasing memory formation, spatial orientation, strategic planning and fine motor skills. Thus, it might have more positive effects than negative ones. A game such as Minecraft or Super Mario can both stimulate and encourage exploration for a young mind.
The gaming community, however, has to understand that there are games which are unintended for certain audiences. The vague and generalized Entertainment Software Rating Board rating system doesn’t help matters; a game such as Halo, with hardly any swearing or blood, is given the same M-rating as God of War: Ascension, in which you can rip off the limbs of your opponent in graphic detail.The unclear guidelines don’t help parents or buyers looking to get the latest Call of Duty for their 11-year-old child. Many gamers feel as though suggesting that consumers be responsible with purchases supports censorship.
But there are some exceptions to the rule: A game such as Call of Duty is not appropriate for a young kid to play. There’s something inherently uncomfortable about a 10-year-old playing a game that has featured quicktime events in which you choke a soldier to death or readily open fire on civilians in a Russian airport.
Though those scenes were used to show the brutality of war, playing it without any prior context just doesn’t seem right. It’s the same case with GTA V; as an adult playing it, you understand that Rockstar Games, the studio behind the franchise, is making a mature, twisted mockery of American culture. A kid isn’t going to get the satire or subliminal drama, however, just the mindless violence and profane language.
For consumers and the gaming community, it’s important to be more responsible with our purchases and what kind of content that we’re passing off to others.

On Oct. 17, the Mexican Senate approved an additional 5 percent tax on junk food and a 1 peso per liter tax on soft drinks. According to Slate, Mexicans consume about 16 ounces of soft drinks per day. In addition, 70 percent of Mexican adults are considered overweight, while the country’s obesity rate recently surpassed the United States’ at 32 percent, and continues to climb. Clearly, this alarming statistic indicates a need for change, but a tax on junk food is not the most effective way to combat national obesity.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
 
Mexico’s junk food tax is poorly implemented and risks causing more harm than good by only evaluating foods on their caloric density. This junk food tax raises the price on packaged foods with 275 calories or more per 100 grams, which includes products such as Hostess Cupcakes and Doritos as well as beef jerky and almonds. But calories do not provide the whole picture when making intelligent food choices. When eaten in moderation, calorically dense foods make up part of a healthy diet. Even fatty foods, such as nuts, olive oil and avocados ,should not be eschewed completely; they provide key nutrients and contribute to a balanced diet.
Undoubtedly, calories play an integral role in weight gain, but they are not the only factor in healthy eating. Serving size and nutrition also play an important role in weight gain. If a consumer chooses to eat 12 servings of a less dense food, such as lemon sorbet, or one serving of a calorically dense food, such as a cinnamon bun, the caloric total is the same. In order to promote overall health, society should focus on nutrition. According to Medical Daily, many obese children also suffer from malnutrition. This paradox stems from a reliance on fast food and items with low nutritional value.
In addition, The New York Times points out that obesity is strongly related to poverty. The poor generally rely on cheap, readily available, nutritionally poor foods. Instead of taxing these items as a means to deter people from buying them, the government should address the unequal access to healthy options. Initiatives to educate and promote healthier food options in areas with high rates of obesity would better address the problem than creating a blanket tax on junk food. For example, reforming the school lunch programs to include healthier food not only helps children focus on learning but helps foster better eating habits.  Clearly, a better approach is needed in order to create the most benefit.
The soda tax has loopholes and proves to be an incomplete solution to the country’s rising obesity levels. Taxing sugar and calories invites an increase in artificial sweeteners and poses additional health risks. Coca-Cola’s Mexican branch proposed switching to corn syrup instead of cane sugar to evade the tax, according to an article in Slate. Yet, this switch to zero-calorie sweeteners does not solve the problem. According to a study published by the Duke University Medical Center, Splenda decreases friendly intestinal bacteria. Even though artificial sweeteners are touted for their lack of calories, in reality, they do not let consumers “have their cake and eat it too.” Artificial sweeteners give consumers a false sense that the sugar-free desserts they are eating are somehow healthy and do not foster healthy long-term eating habits.
Instead of levying a tax on government-defined “junk food,” Mexico should offer incentives for healthy eating and lifestyle choices. Not only do positive rewards foster a healthier attitude toward food, they can also help build lasting habits. According to the Telegraph, a National Health Service study demonstrated that people who received cash incentives for making healthy food choices continued to make good choices even after cash payments stopped. Creating fiscal rewards or tax incentives for healthy choices will help consumers equate healthy choices with positive rewards instead of junk food with punishment. In addition, Bloomberg reported that the national health service estimates that the soda tax will only reduce consumption between 10 and 13 percent.
Though it seems logical to blame the obesity epidemic on soda consumption, there are more factors contributing to this health problem. Using soda as a scapegoat for the national obesity epidemic is tempting but also shows a lack of critical thinking. Obesity is a complicated issue with many contributing factors. It cannot be simplified into soda consumption nor fixed through a junk food tax.
No one would argue that consuming excess amounts of soda is healthy, but a soda tax alone cannot solve the obesity epidemic. Junk food consumption is the most visible cause of obesity, not the most persistent and a tax on junk food will only provide a surface solution to this growing problem. Instead, Mexico should adopt an integrated approach, which focuses on proper nutrition and exercise, not just criminalizing soda and junk food.

“Using soda as a scapegoat for the national obesity epidemic is tempting but also shows a lack of critical thinking. Obesity is a complicated issue with many contributing factors. It cannot be simplified into soda consumption nor fixed through a junk food tax.” Exactly right that obesity derives from many, diverse risk factors (i.e., genetics, age, stress, etc.) – and is not uniquely influenced by beverage consumption. We agree that this tax is unproductive and misguided. Studies and real-world examples confirm soda taxes won’t reduce obesity, and could even have the opposite effect. Lastly, we concur with this conclusion: “Instead of levying a tax on government-defined ‘junk food,’ Mexico should offer incentives for healthy eating and lifestyle choices. Not only do positive rewards foster a healthier attitude toward food, they can also help build lasting habits.” This holistic approach is a far more effective way to change health for the better.
