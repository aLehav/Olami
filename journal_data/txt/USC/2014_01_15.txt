With special programs each day and contests for area photographers, the exposition will delight art critics and amateur photographers alike.
LA art show
The L.A. Art Show, known as the West Coast’s most comprehensive art experience, will be at the L.A. Convention Center from Thursday to Sunday. The exhibit features four distinct sections: Modern and Contemporary, Historic and Traditional Contemporary, the Vintage Poster Section and the IFPDA L.A. Fine Print Fair. Some of the highest-ranked galleries from around the world will be showcased at the longest running showcase for contemporary, modern, historic and traditional art in the United States.
Tyga
Michael Ray Ngyuen-Stevenson, better known as Tyga (an acronym for Thank You God Always), is a chart-topping rapper originally from Compton, Calif. Tickets are selling quickly for his tour, which will hit the Belasco Nightclub on Friday at 9 p.m. Tyga, who didn’t receive much attention until his hit single “Rack City,” is now a major draw, so make sure to “Switch Lanes” on the way downtown to catch his show.
Joan Rivers
As a public hater of, well, everyone, The Queen of Comedy never fails to entertain audiences with slur after slur about public figures, the elderly, fashion wrongdoers and anyone else who happens to draw her ire. Rivers is set to bring humor, insults and plenty of entertainment to Beverly Hills this Friday. In the same tone as her bestselling book “I Hate Everyone, Starting with Me,” Rivers’ performances feature off-color jokes and make a mockery of as many people as possible — often herself included.

It’s no secret that January is considered Hollywood’s dumping ground: a mass grave for misfits and miscreants whose releases have been strategically timed to go relatively unnoticed amid the plush pageantry of awards season. Every year brings the same ragged procession of interchangeable demonic possession movies (Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, this weekend’s Devil’s Due), ham-fisted action epics (Renny Harlin’s mythological mega-flop The Legend of Hercules, the extremely dire-looking I, Frankenstein) and aggressively unappealing comedies (Ride Along, That Awkward Moment). Only the titles seem to change.

There are exceptions, of course. The Oscar-nominated Brazilian import City of God was released in January, as was Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s genre-bending horror western From Dusk Till Dawn and Troy Duffy’s love-it-or-loathe-it cult classic The Boondock Saints. Liam Neeson has a very particular set of skills for scoring mid-winter hits, starting with the original Taken in 2009 and the underrated survivalist drama The Grey four years later. Now director Kenneth Branagh (Hamlet, Thor) is hoping to join their ranks with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, a sleek, ambitious modernization of the late Tom Clancy’s seminal spy series
The film, which follows a younger Ryan (Chris Pine) on his journey from rookie analyst to hardened field agent during an especially perilous mission to Moscow, was slated for a Christmas Day opening until Paramount decided to give the slot to Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street instead. The decision made sense from a practical standpoint, even after Clancy’s death renewed interest in the film series and the books that had spawned it. After all, Scorsese’s film — a ferocious satire of corporate greed that was already in the news for having just narrowly escaped the dreaded NC-17 rating — was a surefire awards contender with a legendary director, a top-tier cast and a trailer that had been dissected and raved over for months.
Jack Ryan, by contrast, is a far riskier venture: an old-school espionage thriller built around a young star who has never carried a movie on his own before — although Kevin Costner is on hand as Ryan’s crotchety CIA mentor — and a hero who hasn’t been seen onscreen for over a decade. Pine, an affable presence in J.J. Abrams’ rebooted Star Trek series and Tony Scott’s runaway train thriller Unstoppable, is probably the least famous face to ever play the part of Ryan. The courageous spook was first introduced to moviegoers in director John McTiernan’s 1990 adaptation of Clancy’s most celebrated novel: The Hunt for Red October, where he was played by Alec Baldwin.
In 1992, action stalwart Harrison Ford stepped into the role for two further adventures: Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, more conventional political thrillers that saw Ryan and his family squaring off against I.R.A. assassins, Colombian drug cartels and several would-be kidnappers. Eight years after Ford’s last bow, Ben Affleck starred as Ryan in The Sum of All Fears, a film notable mainly for its disquieting depiction of a nuclear bomb being triggered at a football stadium in Baltimore.
Branagh, a filmmaker primarily known for his lavish, sometimes exhaustive Shakespeare adaptations, has refashioned himself into a competent hit-maker since helming the first Thor movie for Marvel back in 2011. It’s been fascinating to watch him revel in the inherent theatricality of these stories, whether it’s Clancy’s international intrigue or familial spats among the Asgardians. Judging from the Jack Ryan trailers and featurettes, he also looks lethally effective in his role as the film’s main villain: a corrupt Russian businessman with the deliciously diabolical moniker Viktor Cherevin.
Despite the ignominy associated with January openings, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is on track to become a bona fide box office success. The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has become increasingly lucrative in recent years, and the film’s relatively modest $60 million budget should not be difficult to recoup, especially given the franchise’s historical popularity overseas. Also, even though Branagh’s movie is opening against three other wide releases — Ride Along, The Nut Job and Devil’s Due — its holiday competition would have been far stiffer, even without The Wolf of Wall Street in the mix. Maybe January has a silver lining after all: any halfway decent movie has a shot at being king of the dumping ground.

Nestled among the sound system at West Hollywood’s House of Blues Tuesday night was a famous band who took the stage among whoops and hollers from the crowd of a few hundred. With dim lighting and a few concertgoers even sitting on couches just a few feet away from the performers, singing along, one would never guess that this was a rock concert. There are no flashing lights, no smashing guitars.
“Kryptonite” · Chris Henderson, lead guitarist of the Mississippi-based rock band 3 Doors Down, gave an excellent performance last night at the House of Blues. Their tour continues with one more show in Anaheim. – Photo courtesy of 3 Doors Down
But that, of course, has never been 3 Doors Down’s style. Instead, after playing sold-out shows to thousands of fans, charting their first single on the top three of the Billboard Hot 100 and having their debut album certified 6x platinum in the United States, 3 Doors Down announced their “Songs From the Basement” tour, which kicked off Jan. 10 and feels exactly how it sounds — like watching an act that has yet to be discovered.
The band played a 75-minute set, running a little late and ranging from some of their bigger hits such as “Let Me Go” to lesser-known tracks such as “Away From the Sun,” and closing with — no surprise here — “Kryptonite,” the song that propelled them to stardom in early 2000.
Because several of the songs on the set list had never been played live before, it was unlike any performance the band had put on to date. Before playing one particular tune, lead singer Brad Arnold asked that the audience to forgive him if he made a mistake, as he hadn’t performed it in years — of course, he made no mistakes, but just saying that made it feel as if he was opening a curtain, allowing the audience to peek at something that no one had ever seen before.
A fan looking for a replay of the group’s greatest hits might have left disappointed — bored, even. But it’s the fan seeking to grow closer to the music they already love in a new way who Arnold speaks to when he says, “God Bless you, my friends,” over and over again after every track.
Another big takeaway was the influence of the band’s Southern origins on the evolution of their sound. Having seemingly straddled the line between rock and mainstream for the past decade and a half, who knew they were from Escatawpa, Miss.?
But more than the confession that he used to drive a tractor, it was Arnold’s deep, drawn-out twang — surfacing when he hit the higher notes more so than in the band’s earlier days — that gave away his country roots. The vocals were rich and resonant — probably the highlight of the show — filling up the venue and bouncing off the walls like smoke in a Prohibition-era cigar lounge.
Though the performance was advertised as “unplugged,” and the band replaced their electric guitars with acoustic ones, it still felt very rock ‘n’ roll, and power and volume were not sacrificed for the clarity of the lyrics or intricacy of the notes. The only noticable adaptations appeared in songs such as “Kryptonite,” where the chorus asked for yelling, but instead, Arnold delivered a toned-down version, rattling the pitch of his voice in and out to demonstrate more of a range than the song originally provides for.
It might have been Southern hospitality coming out, but Arnold spoke comfortably and casually with the crowd before each song, not so much bantering with his fellow musicians, who barely spoke, but sharing his secret recipe of melted gummy bears in hot water that soothes his throat, or the story of a 16-year-old boy who started crying at a festival they played in Europe because he was so moved by a song.
It was these anecdotes, however tangential, that allowed attendees to view the band as more than just a late ’90s/early millennium one-hit wonder searching for a comeback. Though the audience might have suggested otherwise — composed of middle-aged couples overzealously lip-synching like it was their patriotic duty — it’s clear that this band isn’t concerned with reliving the past. All they want is to play music and share that love of music with the rest of the world — and prove that they’re grateful for every second of it.
 
3 Doors Down is set to perform in Anaheim on Jan. 20.

In his first inaugural address, President Ronald Reagan cemented his place in the cliché hall of fame with his remark that, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.”
Sure, the conventional conservative wisdom holds that the government that does least does best. By that metric, the 113th Congress is on fire.
This year will be no different. Beyond a resolution to the fiscal crisis flavor of the month, no major policies will be passed. But voters, particularly those concerned about the future of their political parties should pay as much — if not more — attention to this second session of the 113th Congress than they did the last one. The refiguring of the respective party identities ahead of the midterm election will serve as a barometer for the 2016 presidential election and will set the tone for the last two years of the Obama presidency.
The first two weeks of the New Year surely disappointed political optimists who thought 2014 would bring landmark legislation like comprehensive immigration reform and a raise in the minimum wage. In addition, the nation’s congressmen voted to block extending unemployment benefits for over one million Americans. The negotiations were derailed by the ghost of the Affordable Care Act when Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) asserted that dismantling it would be a more effective economic stimulus than unemployment benefits (because if government assistance to poor people isn’t economic stimulus, what is it good for after all?).
The majority of Congress might be millionaires, but the majority of Americans are not.
Not to be outdone, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) asserted that Democrats were using the debate over jobless benefits as a campaign issue. “In other words, instead of working on reforms that would actually help people overcome the challenges so many of them face in this economy, Democrats plan to exploit these folks for political gain,” McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Sadly, the unemployment debate will soon give way to the most recent impending fiscal calamity, an issue that voters have become so desensitized to that a government shutting down or hitting the borrowing ceiling is not alarming. Though a budget agreement came as an early Christmas present, lawmakers were set to vote on the actual spending bill Wednesday and agree to raise the federal borrowing limit by mid-March.
Ultimately, both parties have an identity crisis to resolve, and the post-fiscal and pre-midterm legislative session will be the stage upon which that resolution unfolds, instead of the stage upon which meaningful policies are passed.
For the Democrats, convincing the nation to forget the Affordable Care Act tops the list. The GOP already intends to make the 2014 midterm elections a referendum on the signature law, the success of which will depend on both the continued progress of the rollout and the ability of the Democrats to refocus the election on something else.
The party as a whole has settled on income inequality as the means to achieve that end, justifying it with the recently-celebrated 50th anniversary of then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty” speech that marked the beginning of the great society and one of the largest expansions of government aid in our nation’s history. The Democrats’ pick is a good one: Policies like raising the minimum wage not only have huge appeal with voters, but are difficult to counter in the wake of the 2008 recession and the Occupy Wall Street movement.
The Republican leadership, in its opposition to the new great society project being undertaken by Democrats, must make a decisive choice between the Sen. Ted Cruz’s and Gov. Chris Christie’s if Christie could stop creating traffic jams for his political rivals.
The statements and actions of the Republicans in Washington towards Christie will determine whether or not this is true. Today’s GOP has pushed itself to the brink of irrelevancy; while they would still come down on Reagan’s side in their agreement that a small government is a good one, that’s about all that can be said for their resemblance to the favorite conservative of the day. If Reagan could fight with Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neil and still manage to be three times as productive as the 113th, then the GOP can surely put some distance between itself and folks like Rand Paul. If Reagan saw them filibustering and reading children’s books on the floor of Congress, he would roll over in his grave.

“Productivity” in Congress is the opposite of good. The more Congress works, the higher the burden on everyone else. Witness the ACA – its passage meant that millions had to deal with its consequences. All the ACA’s “successes” are questionable since the bills come from the IRS in April. Government does not “make” and sell stuff that people want to buy. Government sends out orders and promises fines, jail, and death for those that do not comply. 
Name a single bill that passed into law recently that relieves a burden without transferring the burden on another.
hi
Nate tells us “Congress must break unproductive streak.” Not going to happen, Nate. We are going to see more of the same, worse and worse. Why? Because we have reached a point where personal re-election and then party support are more important than running the country effectively. Yes, our Congressmen do want to run the country effectively and they try to do so. When? When they judge it will be consistent with re-election and with agreements with party colleagues who are helpful in sustaining their personal power and influence.
I hope to God I am wrong, but I think we are seeing a political system where over time, the flaws have appeared that are rendering the system ineffective. Much has changed in politics and in the complexities of competing for power, influence and re-election. Perhaps Congress will find a way to begin cooperating unselfishly for the good of the county. Hard to believe it will happen, though. May I be utterly and completely incorrect in my analysis and my gloomy prediction.

On New Year’s Eve, anonymous hacker group SnapchatDB released a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
The unidentified hackers posted the information with the last two digits of the phone numbers removed on a site called SnapchatDB.info, claiming that their motivation to leak the information was to raise public awareness about the need for enhanced security measures. Regardless of the hackers’ supposed good intent, the hack reveals a serious need for the photo messaging application to address its security issues to ensure that this type of leak never happens again.
This security crisis arose in late August when an Australia-based group of security researchers known as Gibson Security published a “Snapchat Security Advisory.” In doing so, Gibson Security, which is unaffiliated with SnapchatDB, exposed a way to manipulate Snapchat’s servers to find its secret application-programming interface (A.P.I), a specification that describes how one piece of software communicates with another, thus making it easier for anyone who could obtain the data to decrypt, view and even replace messages. The ability for people to easily obtain this information proved to be detrimental not only to Snapchat’s mantra of privacy, but also to its millions of users’ security.
Gibson Security also discovered another security issue, which they dubbed the “find_friends exploit.” Snapchat encourages its users to register their phone numbers and allow the app to scan their contacts lists to locate friends who have also joined, a feature Snapchat calls “Find Friends.” Using the A.P.I., Gibson Security realized that they could transmit phone numbers to Snapchat’s servers and match them with their corresponding usernames. One of the main problems behind this was that Snapchat did not curtail the number of phone numbers that could be checked at once. In one test, Gibson Security was able to get 75,000 numbers at once.
This security breach, however, goes beyond simple usernames and phone numbers. By combining this data with databases of commonly used passwords or other information, experts say that hackers can sometimes steal consumer identities and access their financial accounts. With the use of social media and other Internet sites rapidly increasing, and this type of private information becoming more and more accessible, such threats are bound to increase, making Snapchat’s security vulnerabilities all the more dangerous to its application’s fifty million users.
Despite this serious breach of security, Snapchat’s initial responses to the leak were minimal and downplayed. It took nine days before Snapchat formally apologized for the problem in a blog post, which noted two security improvements: First, that the app will more explicitly allow users to decline attaching their phone number to their username and, second, that the app will require new users to verify their phone number before using Find Friends, making it more difficult to utilize the exploit.
But Snapchat’s 50 million users deserve more than simple statements of apology. They deserve more than weak security measures. Rather, they need a platform that guarantees their privacy and anonymity — one of the very reasons behind the application in the first place.
With new communication applications and rising competition everyday, Snapchat users need not feel loyal to the app when there’s no incentive of security. There’s nothing stopping users from using Instagram’s new messaging feature instead. This hack was made under the alleged motivation of exposing the security threats in order to raise public awareness.
Next time, Snapchat might not be so lucky.

USC shook off the rust after a long holiday break to emerge victorious in several swimming and diving events last weekend.
Both the men’s and women’s swimming teams defeated Wisconsin on Saturday at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center to stay undefeated in dual meets. The men defeated the Badgers to improve to 3-0, while the women won 154-103 to move to 5-0 after beating Utah 119-91 on Friday.
“All teams had been off training for two weeks, so we had our most intense training when we got back to campus,” USC head coach Dave Salo said. “We did a nice job of coming off of a strong training session against a good team in Wisconsin.”
The No. 5-ranked Women of Troy started off strong with a victory in the 200-yard medley relay, starting a series of triumphs in the 200-yard freestyle, 500-yard freestyle, 1000-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, 100-yard freestyle, 100-yard breaststroke, 200-yard backstroke, 200-yard breaststroke and 200-yard butterfly.
“The women did a really solid job,” Salo said. “They’ve had the best relays in the country so far.”
Redshirt junior Haley Ishimatsu finished first in the 1-meter diving event and sophomore Natalie Kalibat took second.
The No. 6-ranked men’s team was equally dominant, as their top two 200-yard medley relay teams both finished before the Badgers’ first-string relay.
“All of our relays have qualified for the NCAA Championship,” Salo said. “And relays score so many points in meets, they’re so important.”
USC also had male individual swimmers take first place in the 50-yard freestyle, 200-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, 100-yard breaststroke, 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard butterfly.
The men’s sophomore duo of Collin Pollard and Adam Payne took the top two podium spots in the 3-meter diving event to help clinch the victory.
“We don’t have a weak event,” Salo said. “To have a very competitive swimming/diving team, you have to have a great balance on both sides. We have very strong swimmers, and our divers have been performing at the top of the conference.”
The squad’s most accomplished divers were just as successful in their separate weekend competition, the Bruin Diving Invitational.
Pollard and Ishimatsu both swept the meet’s men’s and women’s platform events, respectively, with scores far better than their closest competitors.
