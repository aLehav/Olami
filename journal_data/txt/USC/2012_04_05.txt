Students and staff members discussed on Thursday at the Von KleinSmid Center USC’s Master Plan and its potential community impact.
The potential for job creation as part of the Master Plan’s initiatives for development struck interest with David Galaviz, executive director of local government relations for USC.

“[USC] will make sure that there is a local hiring component, so that the residents have access to these jobs,” Galaviz said.
Community impact was a theme of the night, as the potential for affordable retail stores as well as easing housing concerns in the areas surrounding USC were discussed.
“We are creating 5,200 beds, meaning we could ease some of the housing pressure in the community,” Galaviz said.
Galaviz also noted that the increase in housing as outlined by the Master Plan could put some downward pressure on rents, thus making neighborhood housing more affordable.
Karina Casillas, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning and American studies, said USC is only showing the “sunny side” of the development.
“Students want more affordable housing options, not necessarily new ones,” Casillas said.
Max Hoiland, a senior majoring in critical studies, is also concerned about a possible rise in housing prices as a result of the Master Plan.
“I live about a mile off campus with a bunch of students,” Hoiland said. “This plan would probably increase rent in the area since USC hasn’t made any specific commitment to affordable housing, and private landlords would have the ability to raise their prices too.”
The possibility that a higher-end retailer would replace Superior Grocers also worried Casillas.
“Everything found in those [higher-end] stores is at a higher price, which means the community won’t be able to afford it, and they will have to shop in a different neighborhood,” Casillas said.
Galaviz tried to dispel commonly held fears by stressing that over the last four to five years, the university has sponsored at least 200 community meetings through either an advisory council or door-to-door outreach in order to give community members a chance to voice their opinions.
Community members were also able to have their voices heard during the two open houses organized by the City Planning Department, which more than 350 people attended, 300 of whom supported the plan.
Casillas, however, feels that the student body has not been afforded the opportunity to fully understand and discuss what the Master Plan entails. She plans to work with the United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement, and will conduct an open forum regarding the development plans.
“This event is not about being ‘for’ or ‘against’ the Master Plan but merely a call for equal consideration,” Casillas said.
Joshua Sena, a junior majoring in sociology, said including everyone in the discussion about the Master Plan encourages its success.
“The best course of action would be a collaboration between students, the community and USC,” Sena said. “Everyone affected should have an input as to what should be done.”

I’ve got to disagree. I was at the meeting because I wanted to learn more, and I definitely did – I am not at all opposed to the Master Plan or the redevelopment of University Village, and I’ve not spoken to anyone that is (no one at the meeting was opposed to the whole idea either). The prospect of jobs, safety, amenities, cleanliness etc. is great! I just want the Plan and the UV upgrade to be done in a way that benefits members of the surrounding community and is responsive to community concerns, and particularly that helps create and maintain affordable housing. Students displacing long-time residents has been occurring pretty significantly already, so I wouldn’t call it bogus when students assert that displacement will likely increase. I really do think this can be a win-win for all involved – as long as key concerns are addressed.
This site captures some of what I’m talking about – http://www.usc2030.com/
I thought our students were smarter than this.
They are all speaking from the gut without any facts backing them up. In truth,  they are ignoring the facts.
They are just dead wrong–hard to believe they could be so outside of the circle of knowlege about urban planning and this plan in particular.
This is a godsend to the neighborhood and the people from the neighborhood know it.
RE: “I live about a mile off campus with a bunch of students,” Hoiland said. “This plan would probably increase rent in the area since USC hasn’t made any specific commitment to affordable housing, and private landlords would have the ability to raise their prices too.”
These students obviously have no idea how housing/rents work (i.e. supply and demand)…If private landlords have to compete with more housing options available for students, landlords will most likely have to lower their rents to attract students away from the additonal housing options available in the market.
On the other hand, if USC does not address the “pressure” on the housing market (by “pressure” I assume they mean the increasing need for off-campus housing), then landlords have no reason to lower their rents, and as demand continues to increase for off-campus housing, that would even give landlords the ability to raise rents further.
Exactly. All this talk about community displacement is bogus. This new development will do wonders for everyone in the surrounding community, yes, including local residents. There is no need to fear progress people! Not all development is bad! This is another crucial step towards making the neighborhood around USC (and USC itself) a safer and more attractive place to live. I am behind this development 100%

Elgin Stafford, known for his kind-hearted and “contagious personality,” was found dead March 31. He was 23.
Stafford graduated from UC Berkeley as an interdisciplinary studies major, a program that allows students to develop an individualized course of study, before coming to USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Vanessa Aldrich, who met Stafford in 2006 while they were both perspective students at Berkeley, said that Stafford was always outgoing and treated others respectfully.
Smiles · Shannon Troutman (right) and others described Elgin Stafford (left) as being the “life of the party” and a devoted community member. - Photo courtesy of Shannon Troutman
“Elgin was the life-of-the-party kind of guy,” Aldrich said. “There wasn’t a soul on Earth who hated him. He was always devoted to the community.”
At UC Berkeley, Stafford was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, an African-American fraternity.
“He was very in tune with his background and heritage,” said Joshua Lomelli, a close friend of Stafford’s at Berkeley.
During his freshman year, Stafford, whose parents emigrated to the U.S. from Sierra Leone, lived on a special interest floor for black students.
“It was more about pride in himself and who he was,” Lomelli said.
Shannon Troutman, who met Stafford 10 years ago, the summer before they entered Carson High School, said her fondest memory of Stafford was at Berkeley after the 2008 presidential elections. Troutman said she went with Stafford to Sproul Hall, where students were discussing the election of President Barack Obama and the passage of Proposition 8. Stafford could not resist chiming in, Troutman said.
“He ended up getting people into a chant, singing ‘We Shall Overcome,’” she said. “They had an American flag and an LGBT flag and he was running around with it. He just got people so amped and excited. It was just something about him that made people want to do something. That’s when Elgin really started to come out of his shell. He just always made sure people knew what he was about.”
After graduating from UC Berkeley, Stafford began working toward a graduate degree in public diplomacy at Annenberg. He withdrew from the program at the end of last semester.
Stafford, who loved to travel, was particularly interested in Japan, where he traveled when he was 14 through an exchange program. He often shared his knowledge of Japanese culture with his friends.
“He was sort of a pseudo-expert of Japanese popular culture,” Aldrich said. “He taught himself the language and knew everything about Japanese pop music.”
Last summer, Stafford interned for U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). On Monday, Bass posted a condolence message on her Facebook page noting Stafford’s drive.
“Elgin was extremely dedicated to his work and brought energy and enthusiasm to every task he was assigned. … It was extremely difficult to learn of his disappearance and later of his untimely death. My heart goes out to his family and I will continue to keep them in my prayers,” Bass said.
One of Aldrich’s strongest memories of Stafford is his smile.
“He had a remarkable smile,” she said.
Troutman said Elgin’s personality and comportment always lifted the spirits of others.
“He was really outgoing and always put a smile on someone’s face, always made them feel welcome,” Troutman said. “Whenever someone would see Elgin, their face would just light up.”
The Los Angeles County Coroner’s office has not released a cause of death in the case. Stafford’s body was found March 29 in the Dominguez Channel, nine days after he had been last sighted leaving his Carson, Calif., home.
A public funeral and memorial service is planned for April 14 at 11:30 a.m. at Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. In lieu of flowers, his family has asked that donations be made in his name to College Bound.

Though the USC Shoah Foundation Institute is already renowned for its collection of testimonies from Holocaust survivors, it now hopes to broaden its archives to include the Armenian genocide.
More than 400 testimonies from survivors of the Armenian genocide recorded on 16mm film by Armenian-American filmmaker Dr. J. Michael Hagopian will soon be added to the foundation’s nearly 52,000 testimonies from around the globe.
An estimated 1.5 million people died between 1915 and 1923 in the Armenian genocide.
Hagopian met survivors of the massacre while traveling internationally to film documentaries and interviewed them to preserve their stories.
The Shoah Foundation Institute hopes adding the Armenian genocide to its archives will be the first step in expanding its collection to include all genocides. Researchers are also working to track down testimonies from genocides in Rwanda and Cambodia.
Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute, said discovering similarities across genocide records allows scholars to find their origin.
“Having testimonies from different genocides is not about comparing human suffering, because that’s not possible, but about comparing the causes and the consequences [of the genocide],” Smith said. “It’s in understanding the causes and consequences that we understand how we might prevent genocide in the future and also how it affects the individuals who have been through it.”
The diversity in the survivors Hagopian interviewed only makes the collection more interesting, Smith said. The tapes include interviews from survivors not only in Armenia, but also from locations as far flung as North America, the Mediterranean basin and India.
“We are getting both a very personal and a very broadly based geographical understanding of what those individuals went through,” Smith said.
Smith said the personal nature of these interviews also makes Hagopian’s collection stand out.
“Most of what we have on the Armenian genocide so far is documentary information, but these testimonies will lend a tremendously valuable insight into understanding personally what these individuals went through,” Smith said.
Members of the Armenian community also see the addition of these testimonies as a key step in the preservation of the history of this genocide.
Jerry Papazian, a board member of the USC Institute of Armenian Studies’ Leadership Council and chairman of the Armenian Film Foundation, has even loftier goals for the institute.
“The goal is to start collecting other collections of Armenian genocide victim’s accounts to add to the collection and make this the largest collection of Armenian genocide testimonies side by side with those of the Holocaust survivors,” Papazian said.
Making the stories of these survivors available to the public is also a key motivator behind the project, Papazian said.
“Right now, when the interviews are sitting in a vault someplace, they are not available,” Papazian said. “We were originally able to salvage their testimonies on film, but now with better technology available, why not share them with more people?”
Combining records of the two genocides could also make the archive a much better learning tool, supporters said.
“We hope by learning about genocide through the archive at USC, our students will be better off as citizens of the world to understand genocide and address it,” Smith said. “Genocide is not something we want or anticipate, but it is a fact of human existence and something that we want to understand better.”
The USC Institute of Armenian Studies’ Leadership Council will hold a fundraising gala April 15 to raise money to digitize the testimonies. The Shoah Foundation Institute expects to complete the project by the end of 2012.
Sir;  can you provide the name and publication date of literature from any international rescue agency or aid society not affiliated or allegiant to the Turkish government that backs up your claim?  For any reader who might be fooled by your lies all they need to do is google search “Armenian genocide” versus “Armenian role or cause in genocide”.  Try it and acknowledge the truth.  It won’t kill you…unlike what your forefathers did to mine
Google and wikipedia is littered with Armenian propaganda.  Let’s refer to more reliable sources, shall we?
I am suggesting that you look at page 185 of the book ” Houshamatyan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Centennial, Album-Atlas, Volume I, EPIC BATTLES, 1890-1914″, printed by Next Day Color Printin, Inc. in Glendale, in 2006.  This book, is not written by Turks; it is written by Armenians (ARF). 
Armenians love keeping two sets of books:  
one for public consumption, “Poor starving, helpless, unarmed” Armenians exterminated by vicious Turks one day (April 24) out of the blue, after a millennium of cohabitation (The kind USC Shoah is duped into disseminating)
And the other, like this book I just described, for use by the Armenian youth, where the Armenian revolutonaries talk about “epic battles” with Turks and how they slaughtered Turks with those brave Armenian soldiers and gangs.
Armenians cannot seem to decide:  are they victims of a genocide or victors of epic battles?
These two consepts are mutually excusive, by nature, logic, and truth.
There is a saying in Turkish:  “Liar’s candle goes at by twilight.”  Armenian candles are at their twilight now…

What about it now, dear USC Shoah Foundation?
Do you still wish to be used by deceivers who promote personal stories of suffering, which may be factual, as proof of a genocide that is definitely not?
Jews were killed by the Nazis because of who they were; Armenians were temporarily resettled TERESET) because of what they have done. 
Jews never established Jewish armies behind German lines to create a Jewish state on German soil or killed half a million German noncombatant women and children.  Armenians, on the other hand, did all that and more in the Ottoman Empire between 1890 and 1922.
How can anyone, let alone USC Shoah Foundation, hold the long discredited Armenian claims of genocide equal to the silent memory of 6 million innocent Jews killed during WWII?
Take a look at this photo

Take a look at this incredible photo at http://www.ethocide.com, which refutes the Armenian narrative. Taken in 1906, it depicts cadets in uniform at an Armenian Military Academy in Bulgaria. The Armenian cadets are proudly posing while brandishing their Russian-made MOSIN rifles.  The Armenian Revolutioanry Federation used these weapons since 1893. This photo is the tiny needle that bursts the “genocide balloon” …
Do these people in the photo look like “poor, starving, unarmed, helpless Armenians” ?
If you can say yes, then I will withdraw my objection to the discriminatory approach taken by USC Shoah Foundation. Then again, if you say yes, you are a bigger deceiver than the Armenian book writer Aram Andonian of “fake Talat Telegrams” fame ( http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/andonian.htm ).
This simple, unassuming photo is a “smoking gun” of sorts, pun intended, although none of the guns in the photo are smoking, that destroys the house of cards the Armenians built in their genocide claims,
… that Armenians were always loyal, hardworking citizens;
… that they never did anything to betray their country;
… that they never had armies;
… that they had no guns;
… that they were poor, starving, helpless souls;
… that everything happened one day on April 24, 1915 one day;
… that there was no provocation;
…and that the Armenians never posed a threat.
The Armenian myth is blown with a single photo…
Not All Suffering is Genocide
1/3
What USC Shoah Foundation seems to be doing is agreeing to archive Armenian stories of suffering during WWI, supplied by the Armenian lobby. This is okey as long as such individual stories are not promoted as proof of an alleged genocide, as that would be a dishonest and racist behavior on the part of a respectable institution.  Dishonest because that would ignore Armenian revolts, terrorism, treason, territorial demands, and other Armenian complicity in this tragedy.  And racist because the Turkish victims of Armenian revolutionaries would be disregarded or dismissed.  
If the same institution, however, agreed to archive the personal stories of suffering of Turkish survivors at the hands of Armenians, and there are many more of those, all belonging to the same period, same area, and subjected to the same wartime conditions, then that would be a fair, decent, balanced, and righteous act. Right now, it has all the trappings of a partisan approach to a controversial historical issue.

Armenian military academy?   Uniforms?  Guns?  1906?   Bulgaria?   
Yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes. 
Welcome to the real Armenian-Turkish conflict !
This simple, unassuming photo–an Armenian document first exposed in 1990 in an Armenian language book which I do not have and then again in an English language book in 2006 which I own—is a “smoking gun” of sorts, although none of the guns in the photo are smoking, that destroys the house of cards the Armenians built in their bogus genocide claims,

USC officials acknowledged Thursday that they anticipate the under-construction John McKay Center to be completed by the end of July, in time for the 2012-2013 academic year.
Running room · An indoor turf field located in the basement of the new McKay Athletic Center will provide additional practice space. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The $70-million, 110,000 square-foot facility, which broke ground in January 2011, will house academic support services, a weight room and offices, among other facilities, for USC’s 21 varsity sports.
The McKay Center sits across the street from Howard Jones Field and west of Heritage Hall, which currently serves as the school’s primary athletic facility.
“This [involves] being efficient and utilizing our resources well, so we can keep up on the academic support angle, the sports performance angle, the sports medicine angle,” said Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson, who traveled across the country to visit other facilities and venues. “This isn’t driven through by recruiting. This is driven by maximizing what we can provide for our student-athletes and really giving them what they need to succeed.”
The project will be followed by renovations to Heritage Hall, McDonald’s Swim Stadium and Katherine B. Loker Stadium, which is primarily used by the Trojan track and field teams. No exact timetable has been
released yet.
The McKay Center is composed of three levels. The basement level holds various training facilities, including a 40-yard AstroTurf area, while the first and second levels consist of various academic-support programs and team meeting rooms, as well as a players’ lounge.
Many of those services will be used by football players, along with a number of Olympic athletes.
According to Jackson, academic support for student-athletes played a key role in the decision to build the center.
“From President [Steven B.] Sample to President [C. L. Max] Nikias, those guys have been our biggest supporters,” Jackson said. “This building would not have been [possible] without them. They understand the importance of athletics here at the university, but they also understand the importance of the academic mission of the athletic department.”
Players, roughly two per class, have been consulted throughout the project.
“I was involved, specifically, from the very beginning,” senior quarterback Matt Barkley said. “It was pretty cool to be a part of that — to get the inside look of everything.”
The goal is for construction to be completed in time for training camp for the football team, which typically begins in early August.
“That place is going to be unbelievable,” senior safety T.J. McDonald said. “We’re all excited about it. It’ll give us a place where all the players can go in and chill between classes. We’ll have a spot where we can play video games and just relax.”
The project is also expected to help with recruitment. According to USC coach Lane Kiffin, an effect on the recruitment of future Trojans has already been felt.
“I like that it’s there for our current guys,” Kiffin said following practice on Thursday. “It’s about recruiting. It already impacted the last class we signed. It’ll be a great impact for us.”

Shedding light on gender identity issues among student-athletes, USC’s LGBT Resource Center sponsored an ally discussion Thursday about the new policies the NCAA has made for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender college athletes.
Support · Vincent Vigil, director of USC’s LGBT Resource Center, has worked with USC Athletics staff members on LGBT ally training. - Lisa Parker | Daily Trojan
The new NCAA policy defines regulations for transgender athletes, stating that a transgender man can play on a men’s team but is not eligible to compete on a women’s team without changing the team status to a mixed team. A transgender woman also can compete on a men’s team but not on a women’s team without changing its status to a mixed team.
The change aims to allow student-athletes to maintain their gender identities while still upholding the competitive quality among sports teams, according to Lani Lawrence, a doctoral student at the University of Denver.
“The NCAA was proactive in developing guidelines to support [LGBT] individuals,” Lawrence said. “One thing they wanted to focus on was how to maintain equity between the sports. It’s a tricky subject, and it’s not very clear-cut. [The] NCAA is trying to find a balance, and this [policy] is one of the first times it is really trying to question the guidelines.”
The NCAA also created an Inclusion Initiative Framework that states how the organization will “provide or enable programming and education which sustains foundations of a diverse and inclusive culture,” honoring athletes’ differences in gender expression or sexual orientation.
Though the initiative is a step in the right direction, many still believe the framework will not bring about direct change, Lawrence said.
“The general framework is pretty broad,” Lawrence said. “The policy is not very specific in generating certain types of programming, and it doesn’t name how these initiatives can be created.”
The changes in NCAA policy were created proactively by the organization without being incited by court cases of discrimination, Lawrence said.
“It was something that the NCAA wanted to go ahead and put up front as a way to be inclusive,” Lawrence said. “They do want [LGBT] athletes to compete and realized the issue is something that they should take up and discuss. It’s not perfect, but it’s a step in a good direction to figure out what the guidelines should be regarding LGBT athletes.”
Mirroring the strides made by the NCAA, USC is also working to provide more adequate support for student-athletes, said Vincent Vigil.
“Something as simple as adding the LGBT center as part of USC student resources is a step for us in making sure that our student-athletes know that our center exists,” Vigil said. “We’re also doing an ally training with our student affairs staff members at athletics. We’re making certain that our athletics personnel is aware of the services we provide and that our students know that there are resources available.”
Drawing on her own experiences as a college athlete, Lawrence said the NCAA has made progress but the issue still requires more communication and action.
“This new policy wasn’t around when I was an athlete,” Lawrence said. “So the NCAA is right in putting out statements that they want to be inclusive and want there to be more programming. If people want to create [LGBT programs], they won’t be put down but will be encouraged to become more known to our student-athletes. It’s becoming better now, but there is still a struggle.”

When it comes to country music, icons such as Toby Keith, Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood come to mind.
These performers engage audiences with their sweet, crooning voices backed by that unmistakable Western twang packaged nicely to make lighters wave in the air while fans sing along.
And those icons have always been the most recognized figures in the industry, signing endorsement deals — like Keith did with Ford Motor Company — and winning the majority of country music awards.
But something not-so-expected happened at the Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday: A band won the award for song of the year.
That band is the Eli Young Band, and the song is called “Crazy Girl.” It’s certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and declared Billboard’s most popular country song of 2011.
That’s a pretty impressive feat for a country band considering that out of the top 20 songs on the same chart, 16 of them were from solo artists.
Up until now, country singers have dominated the genre, differing greatly from the perception of the rock genre in which people think about “rock bands.”
There is collectivism in rock music and a tendency toward singularity in country music. But now bands like Rascal Flatts, Lady Antebellum, the Zac Brown Band and the Eli Young Band have burst onto the scene and changed the name of the game.
These groups have made quite a mark and indicated that perhaps the genre is not reserved only for superstar solo performers anymore.
But the Eli Young Band in particular provides an intriguing insight into the recent trend.
Formed in 2000, the band consists of Mike Eli (vocals/guitar), James Young (guitar), Jon Jones (bass) and Chris Thompson (drums). The band spent more than 10 years making music before it finally caught its big break with “Crazy Girl.”
Before that hit, Eli and Young were college roommates looking to turn a passion into a career. Their most recent release, Life at Best, which came out Aug. 16, 2011, is their fourth full-length album.
It took several years, however, for the band to start establishing a presence in the industry. After releasing their second studio album, Level, in 2005, the Eli Young Band got an opening slot on tour with Miranda Lambert.
At this point, the band’s following was just starting to take hold, which meant that there was a fair amount of anticipation for its third studio release, Jet Black and Jealous in 2008.
This moderate success story led to its nomination for the ACM for Top New Vocal Group or Duo in 2010. They ended up losing to the Zac Brown Band, though, and then went on to experience perhaps their most embarrassing moment.
Granted the opportunity to perform the national anthem at a Kansas City Chiefs’ home football game in December of that year, Mike Eli flubbed the words to the song twice and was promptly booed by the crowd.
But the band would bounce back from that moment as they re-asserted their prominence with Life at Best.
The Eli Young Band’s story shows that the members worked hard and together as one cohesive unit through the ups and downs of trying to break into the industry. Eli never abandoned his bandmates for the allure of becoming a solo artist and the band kept writing until they created their best material.
It is a very rock‘n’roll story — a band pays its dues and finally enjoys time in the limelight. And people are taking notice as more bands are starting to become just as beloved as the well-established icons.
Fans are noticing that there is an undeniable chemistry between these band members, and a palpable friendship that goes beyond the music. It is special to see them create and play music together, especially since each one plays an integral part in the writing process.
For solo artists, however, those elements are missing. There is no picking your favorite member or wondering who to watch onstage while the band performs. Sure, these solo artists have backup bands, but the focus is centered on the star.
In a band, everyone gets to be the star, and this trend is firmly taking hold in the country sphere. Newer acts like Tumbledown are starting to stampede onto the scene, and the longtime relevance of established bands such as Rascal Flatts and The Band Perry are proving that many of the future contenders for country music notoriety will be groups as opposed to solo artists.
Ever since the ACM for song of the year was first established in 1967, there have only been seven bands that have won the title. And four of those seven titles have been within the past six years.
The time for country bands to rise to superstar status is just beginning.

American Reunion is nothing without its roots — crumbly, crusty and sex-starved as they might be.
Before the age of Facebook and YouTube, an interconnected generation of unstoppably horny teens was given a realistic, hilarious depiction of the way most Gen Y high-schoolers worried about sex in 1999’s now-classic American Pie.
“This one time, at band camp,” apple pies, Stifler and MILFs all got their dues in the raunchy but well-received first installment of what became a successful trilogy of teen sex comedies that ended with American Wedding in 2003.
But forget pie. What’s more American than reboots and sequels that rob the source material of any originality or wit it had to begin with?
Luckily, American Reunion is spared from these pitfalls and keeps the charm of the original film intact. In the process, the film gives viewers a reunion no one asked for but is pretty darn easy to enjoy.
Though the gags and physical humor gave the first three movies broad appeal, it was the characters that made the story relatable — everyone could find a member of the virginity-busting gang or one of the supporting characters who seemed too real to merely be fictional. So when the entire gang — literally, the entire crew is here, despite the premise involving an oddly timed 13th reunion — shows back up in East Great Falls, it’s hard not to feel the same way that you did about the first few films, love ‘em or hate ‘em.
Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (of the Harold and Kumar series) deftly revive American Pie writer Adam Herz’s original major characters, including the pact-holding quartet of Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas).
The group’s problems, however, aren’t those of the classic teen comedy anymore. Instead, Jim’s got marital problems stemming from the bedroom, Oz is a sportscaster going through a midlife crisis, Finch seems to be a world traveler grounded for far too long and Kev is a kept man.
Faced with the possibility of reliving their glorious high school and college days, each is willing to immediately uproot for the weekend and return to the life of small-town Michigan. Unsurprisingly, obnoxious alpha-male Stifler (Sean William Scott) is there to meet them and is as ready as ever to throw a rager. Hijinks ensue, and though nothing quite approaches the pandemonium of Superbad or The Hangover that we’ve grown accustomed to in more contemporary R-rated comedies, it’s all good fun.
Surprisingly, the women who the five lusted after all through high school might as well be long-forgotten bit players. Apparently Hurwitz and Schlossberg watched a bit too much How I Met Your Mother when writing Allison Hannigan’s return as Jim’s former love interest — and now wife — Michelle, who has all but forgotten her band-geek chic and instead strikes almost identically to the Lily character she plays on the CBS comedy. Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) also return as shadows of their former selves, and though it is nice to see Reid back in action and looking healthy, she does not put up much of a fight in her few scenes.
More notably, Jim’s dad (Eugene Levy) is back once again to awkwardly dole out sage advice and help push plot points about moving on. In need of his own dating advice, he serves just as much a part of the overall message of the film as the rest of the gang.
With three Harold and Kumar films under their belts, Hurwitz and Schlossberg, who also co-directed the film, certainly know how to walk the audience through a complex narrative while keeping mayhem to a minimum, and to great comedic effect. Where Hurwitz and Schlossberg especially succeed is in supplanting the often-crude humor with a surprisingly compelling look into the trouble of moving on from high school and college once real life sets in.
There are times, however, — though give the film credit for trying — where the ploy to make the story more effecting than a simple teen comedy starts to unravel. Minutes go by as American Reunion tries to tie up each loose end with a sign that the characters have grown up a bit, and things get a bit boring in the process.
Thankfully, these lulls are picked up by perfectly timed references to the original film, including cameos from Natasha Lyonne as the ever-cynical Jessica and Jennifer Coolidge as Stifler’s mom of classic MILF fame.
American Pie came at a time when teen comedies needed a face-lift, and the shock Herz’s script provided the genre has been felt ever since. Now, more than a decade later, American Reunion is here to tell a different story — one that caters to the same generation, still makes penis jokes and still delivers a hilarious and raunchy ride with a side of genuine emotion and drama.

American Idiot, playing through April 22 at Ahmanson Theatre, has the chance to be this generation’s RENT.
Contemporary theater · Scott J. Campbell (left), Van Hughes (center) and Jake Epstein (right) star in the Ahmanson’s production of American Idiot as troubled young men struggling to keep it together. - Photo courtesy of Doug Hamilton
Based on Green Day’s 2004 album of the same name, American Idiot tells a story of complete disillusionment in the face of war, media influence and the unknown from the perspective of three friends as they drift apart in self-exploration.
Johnny (Van Hughes, reprising the role from Broadway) runs away from home and succumbs to drugs; Will (Jake Epstein) stays home with his pregnant girlfriend; and Tunny (Scott J. Campbell) heads to the military and gets shipped off to war.
American Idiot’s dynamic set allows the three stories to be told simultaneously within the same space. Will remains on the couch, presumably in his parent’s basement, at the left of the stage for almost the entire production. His constant presence highlights the sense of helplessness in his own life and the inability to motivate himself to move forward. Tunny’s wartime narrative takes place to the right of the stage, with battle and hospital scenes depicted through simple, aggressive choreography. Johnny and his girlfriend Whatsername (Gabrielle McClinton) take center stage in a raunchy lust-turned-love relationship.
The versatile execution of the lyrics, with single lines of songs broken up into conversations between characters, is also especially helpful in the show; the repetition of certain lyrics from different perspectives allows the audience to more fully understand the context of the play.
It’s a brilliant move: The line “Nobody likes you / Everyone left you / They’re all out without you / Having fun” means something entirely different coming from a shopaholic that can barely stand under the weight of her shopping bags than from Will sitting on a couch, alone, wondering how his life turned out so hopelessly.
Similarly, “There’s nothing wrong with me / This is how I’m supposed to be” in “Jesus of Suburbia” is first an in-your-face rally against the status quo; later, as Johnny is contemplating his heroin addiction and Will is drunk in despair from his shattered love life, the lyrics read as a poignant coping mechanism.
If there is a weak link of the show, it’s Joshua Kobak as St. Jimmy — Johnny’s Fight Club-esque drug-bending, alcoholic alter-ego — but filling the shoes of Green Day’s lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong is no easy task. He plays the persona well but takes too many numbers to fully harness his vocal performance.
It’s always risky to alter the arrangement of a favorite song, but American Idiot proves that taking a chance can exceed any and all expectations, as with “Boulevard of Broken Dreams.” The number incorporates string instruments instead of a traditional background chorus and provides an entirely new, completely unexpected vibe to the song. It’s a wonderful portrayal of internal struggle in an open, honest format, and you can’t help but want to sing along.
One of the lesser-known songs, “Give Me Novacaine,” is also one of the show’s highlights. With Epstein’s falsetto mixing beautifully with his acoustic guitar, the song is hauntingly beautiful as Tunny and his fellow soldiers experience the hardships of war; sharp choreography and the presence of Will as he falls deeper into depression  across the stage both work well with the song.
And in a captivating moment near the end of the show, the three main characters assess their lives through the song “Wake Me Up When September Ends.” Hughes’ melodic talent shines through as the three cast members guide the song along with their acoustic guitars. It’s a moment that truly lets the audience appreciate the interwoven contexts of the characters and the raw emotion of a generation that the original source material captured.
American Idiot is no ordinary musical. To someone who isn’t familiar with the original Green Day album, the show can be difficult to feel connected to, but that’s only temporary. By the third song, “Holiday,” viewers will be brought into the world and devil-may-care attitude of the characters, complete with profanity, graphic portrayals of sexuality, pervasive drug use and choreography that emphasizes aggression and flipping people off right in their face.
For fans of the original album, the show only improves upon the original source material. From arrangement changes to three different storylines entangled within the same song book, American Idiot takes the listening experience of 2004 and transplants it into a multi-sensual experience that brilliantly flaunts increased contemporary relevance and a newfound energy.

With the preseason now long gone, the USC track and field team competes this weekend at three different meets across the country. Coming into the second week of the official NCAA outdoor season, the men’s and women’s teams are ranked among the top 10 nationwide alongside traditional track powers such as Arkansas and LSU.

The Trojans leaped five spots upward and are now ranked eighth nationally. The Women of Troy fell from third and are currently ranked fourth nationally, trading positions with Clemson in the process. Despite being ranked among the best teams in the nation, the future remains uncertain for the USC outdoor team as the competition picks up.
Additionally, injuries — both old and new — are another hurdle for the team as they push through a long and difficult weekend at the beginning of the season. Select athletes will first compete at the Stanford Invitational, and then the majority of the team travels to Provo, Utah, to compete at the BYU-USC-Boise State Triple Meet. The majority of the USC track and field team will then finish the weekend at the Tiny Lister Classic, held at Cal State Los Angeles.
Last weekend at the Texas Relays, sophomore Josh Mance suffered injuries while running the men’s 4×400 meter, compounding the issues facing the nationally recognized relay squad.
The men’s 4×400-meter team — alternately consisting of senior Bryshon Nellum, seniors Joey Hughes and Duane Walker, junior Reggie Wyatt and Mance — previously achieved the nation’s leading time in the men’s        4×400-meter relay at USC’s own Trojan Invitational with a time of 3:02.24. A sore hip-flexor muscle sidelined Wyatt at the Texas Relays, although Nellum fought through the pain of a past gunshot wound to complete the first portion of the relay. Following Mance’s injury, the team was disqualified from the 4×400-meter competition at the Texas Relays.
With three of their five athletes injured to some degree, the men’s 4×400-meter team enters this weekend’s events at partial-strength.
This is not to suggest that the entire department’s achievements are contingent on the performance of a single group. The USC track and field team has exhibited depth, going so far as to employ the skills of USC football players this season to gain the advantage. Sophomore Marqise Lee, a wide-out for the Trojan football team, has the nation’s leading mark in long jump among collegiate football players that also participate in track. Senior Tony Burnett, usually seen playing defensive back for USC, also carries this distinction in triple jump.
Additional football players that compete in track include junior Nickell Robey — also competing in long jump — and redshirt sophomore D.J. Morgan, competing in sprints.

The Women of Troy end the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference portion of their schedule this weekend as they travel to the Bay Area for two crucial road matches against No. 8 San Jose State (14-9, 2-4) and No. 2 Stanford (18-1, 4-0).
Road trippin’ · USC is ranked No. 3 in the country and will take its six-game winning streak up north to San Jose State and Stanford. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
A sweep on the team’s trip north could put No. 3 USC (17-3, 4-1) in position for a first-place finish in the MPSF as USC tries to extend its six-game winning streak.
The weekend starts Friday at 1 p.m. with a clash against San Jose State, which has won seven of its last nine matches.
In their season opener, the Women of Troy claimed a 14-6 victory over the Spartans at the Stanford Invitational to extend their all-time record against them to 24-0.
The Spartans are led by attacker Dani Curran and utility player Anna Natalizio, who have combined for 88 goals as San Jose’s top scorers.
The marquee matchup of the weekend goes down Saturday at 1 p.m., when the Women of Troy travel to Palo Alto to play the No. 2 Cardinal.
The two squads matched up earlier this season at the Stanford Invitational on Feb. 4, when the Cardinal eked out an 8-7 win over USC.
Stanford’s only loss of the season came in a 5-4 nail-biter to No. 1 UCLA at the UCI Invitational in late February. Since then, Stanford has reeled off seven wins in a row by an average of 9.7 goals.
Goalkeeper Kate Baldoni is a force in the cage for Stanford, averaging 9.7 saves per game while allowing only 4.5 goals per game.
The Cardinal has a pair of freshman for leading scorers in driver Kiley Neushul with 42 goals and two-meter Ashley Grossman with 37 goals.
USC is 24-24 all-time against Stanford and has lost the last five matches in the rivalry, including an 8-4 defeat in the NCAA semifinals last year.
Both matches tip off at 1 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and after this weekend, the Women of Troy get a two-week break before wrapping up the regular season against CSU Bakersfield on April 20.

Amidst its 41-match win streak, the USC men’s tennis team will continue Pac-12 play this weekend with its final two road matches of the regular season.
Winners · Freshman Yannick Hoffman and the Trojans have won 41 straight matches. They finish up the season with three home matches. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 Trojans (21-0, 2-0) will first take on Utah (11-7, 0-2) Friday at 1:30 p.m. before paying a visit to Arizona (5-12, 0-2) Saturday at noon in USC’s third and fourth consecutive road matches, respectively.
After kicking off conference play with two sweeps at Washington and Oregon last weekend, the undefeated Trojans continued their longstanding streak dating back to last February.
USC senior Steve Johnson, ranked No. 2 in the nation, has amassed 53 consecutive single wins since last January, while the more recent streaks of No. 13 senior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Roberto Quiroz stand at 12 and 10, respectively.
No. 23 sophomore Ray Sarmiento, who was named the Pac-12 Player of the Week for the second time this season, is 29-8 overall in singles.
The Trojans have two more ranked players in No. 38 freshman Yannick Hanfmann and No. 53 Emilio Gomez, who have a combined 31-5 record in dual match singles.
USC also features two ranked doubles pairs. No. 15 Johnson and Quiroz have seven straight doubles victories together, while No. 18 Nguyen and Sarmiento have five consecutive wins together.
Neither the Utes nor the Wildcats have any players nationally ranked in singles or doubles, and both squads have yet to win a conference match.
USC coach Peter Smith, who collected his 200th win in the 7-0 victory over Oregon on Saturday, says that a couple of seventh men, like freshmen Eric Johnson and Jordi Vives, could see some court action in the next two matches.
“I’m always looking to get the whole team involved,” Smith said. “It’s all about keeping this fresh for everyone and keeping everyone feeling a part of it and challenged.”
The Trojans have not relinquished more than two points in a match since Feb. 20, when they defeated No. 3 Ohio State 4-3 in the finals of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships.
Against the unranked Utes and Wildcats, the Trojans look to continue their sweeping victories before concluding Pac-12 play against No. 12 California, No. 11 Stanford and No. 5 UCLA.
“You always want to win top to bottom and win in a big fashion and win quick,” Johnson said. “It’s definitely going to be motivation for the guys, and we’ll all hopefully improve on what we did [last] weekend.”
With only five regular season matches left before postseason play begins, the Trojans have a simple agenda.
“Just get better every day,” Johnson said. “That’s what the guys have done so far and that’s what we plan on doing now. Just get better every single day and work harder, and get ready for Athens.”
Athens, Ga., will be the site of the NCAA championships, where USC hopes to capture its fourth consecutive NCAA title in May.
Before embarking on the postseason, the Trojans look to conclude conference play on a strong note as they continue to build their momentum for a historic championship run.

The quarterback situation at USC just got a little bit more interesting.
On Wednesday night, quarterback Max Browne of Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wash., verbally committed to USC, after a three-day unofficial visit to campus. According to Rivals.com, Browne is the No. 1 overall prospect at his position in the 2013 class.
The 6-foot-5, 210-pound prep star threw for 4,045 yards and 45 touchdowns during his junior season. In two years starting at Skyline, the quarterback has thrown for 8,216 passing yards and 95 touchdowns.
Browne’s verbal commitment gives the USC coaching staff multiple options for senior Matt Barkley’s successor.
According to Mason Kelley of The Seattle Times, Browne is working on graduating high school early, too, so he can enroll at USC during the next spring semester — a similar route Barkley, Cody Kessler and Max Wittek decided to take.
This spring, redshirt freshmen quarterbacks Kessler and Wittek have seen extended snaps behind center. The two have been competing for the backup role on the depth chart behind Barkley. Both are also auditioning for an eventual starting role next year. Now it’s likely a three-man race.
And in case anybody forgot: Redshirt sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins is still at USC. Remember just a couple years ago, Scroggins was supposed to be the next great player? According to Rivals.com, Scroggins was the No. 5 prospect at his position — a dual-threat quarterback with a laser arm and a nice set of wheels.
Does Browne’s commitment  mean the end of Scroggins’ time at USC? With sanctions limiting the Trojans to 75 scholarship players until 2015, can they afford to carry four quarterbacks on their roster?
Probably not.
It’s really unfortunate, too. Call it bad luck or misfortune, but he’s dealt with numerous injuries that have slowed his progress as a player. Now he’s trying to work his way back in the classroom as well. He’s been excused from spring practice so he can focus his efforts in the classroom to gain eligibility for the fall.
“I will be eligible in the fall, there is no question about that,” Scroggins told ESPNLosAngeles.com in February. “I will be practicing in the spring and I will still be here in the fall, no doubt about it.”
But his inability to stay healthy, coupled with his academic issues, isn’t a positive sign. There’s been more hype than show for the four-star prospect out of Lakewood High. And to the coaching staff, it’s not exactly encouraging to see a promising guy like Scroggins miss practice to bring up his grades just so he can step foot on the field. No longer does Scroggins have that so-called extra experience.
Even last fall while Scroggins was recovering from surgery on his throwing hand, it seemed as if Kessler and Wittek leapfrogged the Lakewood native on the depth chart. With both of them enrolling early last spring, it certainly has helped familiarize them with the system and coaching staff.
Again, with Browne verbally committing, the Trojans will have the No. 1 prospect at his position in the class of 2013 and have two other capable players in Kessler and Wittek, who are ranked No. 2 and No. 3 at their positions in the class of 2011, according to                  Rivals.com.
Yes, the starting job isn’t guaranteed to any of those three, either. But with Kessler and Wittek gaining more experience this spring and Browne with the potential to be a star, Scroggins is likely the odd man out.
With the limited amount of scholarship players USC can carry on its roster over the next couple years, it just doesn’t make sense to carry four quarterbacks.
Come next year, not only does the coaching staff have to figure out who will be the heir apparent to Barkley, but they’ll also have to figure out what they want to do with Scroggins.
 
“In the Zone” runs every other Friday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Trevor at trevor.wong@usc.edu
Good story.
Until Browne has attended one class or submitted his LOI, the game is still on for his recruitment and he can pull a Gunner Kiel om USC.  If you don’t remember, Gunmer verbally commited to Indiana, then a few months later commited to LSU, but then enrolled at Notre Dame before decommitting from LSU.  Let’s hope Browne is a more stable decision maker than Kiel.
Fight On brothers and sisters.
Beat everybody!

USC coach Lane Kiffin issued a challenge to his defense prior to the scrimmage portion of Thursday’s practice: force two turnovers and the offensive counterparts would be subjected to conditioning drills at the conclusion of the day.
Kneejerk reaction · Sophomore running back Tre Madden injured his knee in Thursday’s practice. The severity of the injury for the former linebacker is not known at this point, though he was taken off on a cart. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Two interceptions later, offensive players lined up for sprints, with one noticeable exception: Sophomore running back Tre Madden, who had exited the field on a cart after sustaining a potentially serious knee injury.
Madden, who recently made the transition from linebacker to running back, appeared to have injured his left knee while making a cut. He was not hit on the play, and the severity of his injury is unknown.
“There’s that concern any time a guy can’t really walk afterwards, so we’ll find out [the details],” Kiffin said.
Most recently, Madden had been heavily utilized in a Wildcat formation. His possible absence is another blow to an already banged-up offensive unit, still slowly bringing a trio of tight ends back into the fold.
“[Freshman] Junior Pomee was out but is expected to practice Saturday,” Kiffin said. “[Sophomore] Randall [Telfer] hurt his hamstring, but [sophomore] Xavier [Grimble] did the most that he’s done since week one, so that was good.”
Although Kiffin took a somber tone regarding a mounting list of injured players, he did have a reason to be optimistic following a strong showing by his defense.
“The defense did a good job today going after the ball,” Kiffin said. “It was good to see them go after it, hopefully they can do that every day.”
One of the defenders who came up with an interception was newly converted linebacker Tony Burnett. Burnett, a senior, entered spring practice as a defensive back and was in just his second day at the new position.
“It’s basically just an extra safety with a little more flexibility to cover slots, so I’ve just got to remain physical like I am,” Burnett said. “[I need to] be a good tackler, and being able to drop into zone coverage is something new for me, but I can do that.”
Burnett’s pick off redshirt freshman quarterback Cody Kessler was Kessler’s first of the spring.
“I was in my zone,” Burnett said. “Basically, I was settled down, reading the eyes of the quarterback, and when he turned his shoulders I broke on the ball and went and got the ball.”
Kiffin said trying Burnett out at linebacker was inspired by redshirt sophomore Dion Bailey’s success at the position along with the departure of Tre Madden as a source of depth after his switch to running back.
“It was really after seeing the success of what Dion has done there — the move from safety to [linebacker] — and moving Tre [Madden], who was the backup there to the offense,” Kiffin said. “We’ll see how it looks for the rest of spring, it looks good so far. He’s fast; he’s actually bigger and stronger than Dion I’d say. Hopefully it can work.”
Whether or not Burnett stays at linebacker long term, he has high hopes for the defensive unit as a whole going into next season.
“We have an offense that can put up 30-40 points a game on any given day, and all we have to do is shut people down and that’ll make the game that much easier because it forces the other team to get in desperate situations,” Burnett said.

Arrest procedures are designed to facilitate the safe and orderly admission of a person to a detention facility, not to waste precious time and resources undermining that person’s dignity.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The Supreme Court failed to take this concept into account Monday, when it ruled that officials may strip-search people arrested for any offense, even if the officials have no reason to suspect possession of contraband.
The court claims that under these circumstances — that is, potential release into the general prison population — strip searches are not forbidden by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches. The court, however, seems unable to prove what the justifiable reason for these searches might be.
According to the annual FBI Uniform Crime Report, more than 13 million Americans were arrested in 2010. Of these, only about 1.6 million were for drug abuse violations, and 552,000 were for violent crimes. The other 11 million were for offenses ranging from motor vehicle theft to refusal to pay a traffic ticket.
It makes sense that a police officer would strip-search a person arrested for drugs or violent crime. The nature of these offenses suggests that he or she would have good reason to conceal an illegal substance or weapon in intimate locations on his or her body. But should someone who fails to use a turn signal during a harried trip to work or who neglects a child support payment be forced to undergo the same humiliating procedure?
The only reason an officer can provide for strip-searching a person not actually suspected of carrying contraband is “just in case.”
By that logic, police officers should be able to walk up to any person in a public area and demand that the person turn out his or her pockets, on the off chance the officers will find a concealed substance or weapon.
The scenario seems absurd because it is. Our justice system is supposed to be based on probable cause. Everything from the process for obtaining search warrants to the way a lawyer presents a defendant’s case is based on the idea that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Travel too far outside of that realm, and it soon becomes acceptable for a person arrested for a crime such as not paying a fine to be treated like someone who held up a liquor store. Consider what would happen if a prosecutor or a judge adopted the same attitude; he or she might even view a petty offender as a murderer.
Even more troubling is the idea that corrupt officers who might want to use strip searches as a means of sexual harassment have now been granted license to demand strip searches whenever they want, without consequence and without reason.
Unnecessary strip-searching also damages the efficiency of the American justice system. Strip searches take time — time that could often be much better spent actively working to keep the community safe.
While one surrenders many personal freedoms upon being arrested, dignity and privacy are not among them. People should not have their Fourth Amendment right violated in the interest of paranoia.

You article is flawed in it’s misuse of logic.  Your argument that “Our justice system is supposed to be based on probable cause.” is correct however, you failed to take the next logical step.  The person seized by the state has been seized after the application of the 4th amendment protections. They have been seized based on probable cause and it’s the reason why they are in the position to be searched. Your biased examples: “But should someone who fails to use  … be forced to undergo the same humiliating procedure?” are simplistic and one sided.  What about the example: “But should someone who fails to use a turn signal because they had just robbed someone at knife point and was trying to shove their weapon in their underware or someone who just took their child support payment and purchased some cocaine and hid it in their underware be forced to undergo the same humiliating procedure?”.   People in this country were outraged when $1.00 box cutters were used to bring down the twin towers in New York City.  As a result, all of us have been willing to suspend our constitutionally protected rights and allow the TSA to use full body scanners, pat down searches, and force us to remove our shoes to board a plane.  Why should we object when someone who based on probable cause, been legally seized, be required to go through nearly the same procedure we have to go through to catch a plane?  The only difference is that the taxpayers are unwilling to pay for full body scanners and drug sniffing canines for every jail and prison in the country.  The only realistic solution is to use the basic non-intrusive body search. Would you like to consider your position as a tax payer in the following example: “A person fails to use a turn signal because they had just robbed someone at knife point and was trying to shove their weapon in their underware. They are arrested for failure to pay a past due traffic fine and go to jail without being strip searched.  This person then attacks another detainee in jail and kills them using the undetected weapon. The deceased detainee’s family now sues the state (you and I are the state and we pay for the litigation and damages) for millions of dollars for negligence.”  This example illustrates the class of acts the state is trying to prevent.  As a result, the tax payers aren’t footing the bill for something preventable.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Monday in favor of preserving correctional officers’ right to strip search any suspect they take into custody, regardless of the severity of the offense.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
 
The decision has prompted public outcry over what is seen as a humiliating show of power by police officers and a violation of human rights.
But there is a clear reason as to why strip searches cannot be banned in these situations: safety.
Strip searches, if demanded by authorities, require a suspect to stand naked in front of officers and undergo a close visual inspection. No bodily contact, however, is allowed.
There is no doubt that this must be an incredibly unpleasant experience for suspects who are unfortunate enough to undergo a strip search. But such emotional turmoil is minor compared to the physical harm that a suspect hiding weapons could inflict on the general prison population.
The ruling will allow correctional officials to ensure the safety of both officers and inmates. Any other ruling would have been a dangerous removal of professional sovereignty for officers working with some of the most dangerous people in the country.
The main constitutional clause at issue was the unreasonable search and seizure stipulation of the Fourth Amendment, which states that no citizen shall be subject to a search by government authorities or to detainment without established probable cause.
But the court’s decision does not require all suspects to undergo strip searches; rather, it does not prohibit officers from ordering and performing them. Justice Anthony Kennedy stressed that only officers subjected to the dangers of correctional facilities can make the judgment of whether a strip search is warranted.
Some justices who voted in favor of the searches suggested that there might be room for exemption, an example being suspects that are not being held in the general prison population and do not pose a significant threat to others. Still, arrestees being released into the general population in correctional facilities all have the potential to hide weapons or contraband on their persons.
It is relatively rare for strip searches to detect weapons. Justice Stephen Breyer cited an example from an Orange County, N.Y., correctional facility in which there was at most one instance in which a strip search detected contraband among the 23,000 inmates studied.
Nevertheless, the fact that even one person could or would smuggle forbidden and potentially dangerous objects into such facilities is enough to justify the practice.
If a person is arrested, they cannot expect his or her every whim to be satisfied. Of course detainees’ constitutional rights must be upheld and respected, but being strip-searched does not violate these rights.
It might be embarrassing, but safety must trump pride if prisons are to be as safe as possible.

Well, it may come at no surprise, but Grooveshark has come under fire yet again. The international music streaming website is struggling with EMI, which was until recently the only major record label to license its music to Grooveshark. Now EMI has shredded their contract, citing Grooveshark’s failure to pay the last of four major installments.
Grooveshark was created by Sam Tarantino and Josh Greenberg in 2007, and since its creation, the website has experienced a frenzy of popularity among its users, which total more than 35 million. It also boasts the most extensive catalog of any online streaming website, seeing as how those 35 million users are free to upload and share any songs of their choice. Expectedly, it has not been quite as popular with record labels.
Grooveshark swam under the radar for quite some time, but non-paying users have probably noticed by now that instead of being able to automatically search for and play songs once getting to the website, they are prompted by a pop-up to donate any small amount of money they can in order to “keep the music going.” Declining to do so results in having to watch a short sponsored video. This may remind some of Pandora, which was once hip and groovy until it gained popularity, was sniffed out by major record labels, and became saturated with advertisements.
Grooveshark is just another player in the music copyright infringement battle and it is at odds with companies that fear the increasing lateralization of music distribution and access. Think of SOPA and PIPA, websites like 4shared, defeated players like Napster and LimeWire and “termination rights” which allow artists to regain control of their work from labels after 35 years. It’s a muddy battlefield. And as nice as it is to stream music for free, supporting websites such as Grooveshark with a couple bucks to help keep them afloat and ensure that they are not taken away from us along with their unique, ear-opening musical universes may be necessary.
Questions of legality aside, it’s sad to see a company that allows people to explore music so greatly in terms of breadth and depth struggle. Abandoned by EMI, Grooveshark’s future seems uncertain, but hopefully the little streamer manages to keep swimming.
