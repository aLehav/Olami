Juniors Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath were two of the 15 players selected for the All-Pac-10 Team, while redshirt senior Jacki Gemelos was selected as an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention in a vote of the conference’s 10 head coaches.
Cassie Harberts earned a spot on the All-Freshman Team, as well.
Gilbreath was also named to the All-Defensive Team for the third consecutive year, as well as the All-Pac-10 Team for the second straight year.
The versatile guard from Katy, Texas has made her mark in the USC history books, currently standing at No. 16 in career scoring with 1,173 points and No. 7 in career blocks with 119.
Gilbreath leads USC in scoring, rebounding, steals and blocks.
She also ranks second in the conference in steals with 2.6 per game and third in blocks with 1.5 per game.
Corral ranks in some of the top statistical categories for USC, as well.
She is currently No. 19 in career scoring at USC with 1,084 points, and currently holds the record for most three-pointers made at USC with 200.
Corral leads the team in assists this season, and is second in scoring on the team.
She ranks No. 9 all-time at USC in career assists.
Formerly the No. 1 recruit in the nation coming out of high school from Stockton, Calif., Gemelos struggled to get on the court before this season while suffering four ACL tears.
Now, in her first full season on the court for USC, Gemelos was named an All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention.
In her first season, Harberts has become a consistent low-post threat for the Women of Troy, and is the only player to start every game for USC.
The forward from San Clemente, Calif. is fourth on the team in scoring with 9.3 points per game and third in rebounding with 5.7 per game.

Garret Houts had the chance to be the hero.
The Trojans’ junior outfielder stood at the plate with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning. USC trailed UC Santa Barbara 3-2.
Solid work · Junior pitcher Ben Mount threw three scoreless innings in relief against the Gauchos, but nonetheless, USC still fell to host UC Santa Barbara by a score of 3-2. - Daily Trojan file photo 
After entering the game as a defensive replacement, Houts already had the best defensive play of the day when he hosed a runner at home plate to end a Gauchos’ rally.
As has been the case so far this season, however, the Trojans couldn’t find a hero. Instead, USC (3-9) left the bases loaded as Houts struck out and junior Kevin Roundtree grounded out to end the game, giving the Gauchos (7-5) the 3-2 win.
“I felt like I let [the team] down a little bit,” said USC interim coach Frank Cruz. “A big key when you play these one-run games is helping these guys. I’ve got to help them get over the hump.”
The loss is the Trojans’ eighth consecutive defeat, including five one-run games.
“It’s so difficult to swallow and so hard to watch the guys go through,” a somber Cruz said. “They deserve better.”
Situational hitting continues to plague USC.
Despite getting a runner on base in all but one inning and getting the leadoff hitter on base six times, the Trojans managed only one hit with runners in scoring position.
UC Santa Barbara pitcher Nick Loredo picked up the win with seven and one-third innings of solid work, even though he was only expected to throw a couple of innings.
Junior starting pitcher Brandon Garcia was solid through the first four innings for USC, allowing only a single run in the fourth inning.
But he picked up the loss after running into trouble in the fifth inning.
After allowing a pair of singles to lead off for the second consecutive inning, Garcia was pulled from the game.
When junior reliever Ben Mount entered, he was met by Sean Williams’ double that scored both runners and gave UC Santa Barbara a 3-0 lead.
The Gauchos threatened again in the bottom of the seventh inning after Steven Moon hit a line drive over the head of junior left fielder Ricky Oropesa for a standup triple.
But Houts erased Moon when he tried to tag up on a fly out.
“That was a big, big time throw. He put it on the money and Roundtree did a nice job blocking the plate,” Cruz said. “That gave us momentum.”
USC carried that momentum into its at- bat. Houts walked and Roundtree singled. Following a sacrifice, Oropesa drove in a pair of runs with a single to right field that cut the lead to 3-2.
But the Trojans couldn’t get the big hit the next inning.
“Our pitching staff has done what we’ve asked them to do. We walked just one batter and that was [an] intentional [walk],” Cruz said. “We just didn’t have hits when it was time.”
Cruz described the losing streak as a “slow, slow torture” with all the one-run losses and late-inning opportunities USC has had. But he thinks if the guys stick together and keep working, the team can get on a roll.
“Look out when we get one. I think it will really loosen up the guys,” Cruz said. “We just have to stay positive and keep on battling.”
The Trojans will be back in action Friday when they host Saint Mary’s at 6 p.m. in the opening game of the Dodgertown Classic.

It’s that time of year again: Small yet noticeable billboards adorn the L.A. Live plaza, promoting the Pac-10’s annual postseason basketball celebration, which kicks off this afternoon.
The difference in this year’s tournament billboard, however, is that images of UCLA’s Tyler Honeycutt and Washington’s Isaiah Thomas are paired with a few unfamiliar characters.
Along with these two players, Stanford’s All-American senior forward Kayla Pedersen and California’s highly-touted freshman guard, Afure Jemurigbe, are pictured prominently as well.
It seems — and I don’t use these words often nor treat them lightly — Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott and the rest of the conference powers that be have finally gotten something right.
For the first time, both postseason tournaments will conclude the same day under the Staples Center’s roof.
Maybe that isn’t a huge deal, since of the five other major conferences in college basketball, the ACC, Big Ten and Big 12 are also hosting their men’s and women’s tournaments in the same city.
But in those cases, Greensboro, Indianapolis and Kansas City have to serve double duty, as their host conferences chose to either showcase their student athletes in separate venues or, sadly, during separate weeks.
If you are still wondering what this weekend’s events at the Staples Center mean for the Pac-10 conference, it’s quite simple.
An optimistic person would likely say that, at best, the Pac-10 gets a combined nine teams into the two March dances.
It’s conceivable the Big East gets at least that many teams in on the men’s side alone.
Combine the lack of national championship firepower with a terrible time difference, an unavoidable East Coast bias and no substantive plan for a future conference-wide television network, and the Pac-10 has become as irrelevant to the college basketball landscape as Emilio Estevez (insert Mighty Ducks joke here) is to his train wreck of an acting family.
By the numbers, moving the final two rounds of the women’s tournament only adds three extra contests to the weekend’s festivities.
This cuts down the unnecessary 10-minute trips on the Dash or Metro between Galen Center and Staples Center for those diehard Pac-10 fans.
But allowing the Women of Troy to play under the same and more recognizable spotlight of the Staples Center, as their male counterparts have done each of the last nine seasons, means so much more.
Even if most of America pays no attention to this baby step, all signs point to progress for the conference.
Ticket package prices start at $40 a day to take in the semifinals and finals of both tournaments, but the bang for the buck is worth it regardless of the games’ final outcomes.
The Pac-10’s progressive thinking will allow those who enter through the turnstiles of Staples Center something the other conferences have ignorantly neglected: freedom of choice.
Regardless of whether you prefer men’s or women’s basketball, the day-long packages give you the flexibility to see whichever floats your boat: the men’s games, the women’s games or all of it.
In addition to the six total games that will be played Friday and Saturday, the Pac-10 is holding a tournament-long fan fest complete with cheerleaders, mascots, live bands, food vendors and an atmosphere that will undoubtedly be second to none in collegiate sports this weekend.
The pessimist in me has to ask, though, is this all a superfluous attempt to try and rally support for a conference that has seen better days?
At first glance, I’d have to say no.
Showcasing a high-revenue sport across all platforms in one venue is not an act of desperation, but actually pretty logical.
Scott recognizes his product is largely neglected by TV outlets and mainstream America.
But the best way to garner collective interest is to take an annual sporting event and make it into a spectacle that can be enjoyed by fans of all ages and levels of appreciation.
And with the 2011 Pac-10 men’s and women’s tournaments, the forgotten step-child, at least for one weekend in March, will win in more ways than one.

Junior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath first met at the USA Junior National team trials in 2007.
At the time, the two high school juniors from very different backgrounds were both considering a number of schools, including USC.
Hitting the mark · Junior guard Ashley Corral is an outside shooting threat for USC, holding the record for career three-pointers made. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
“We both knew we were thinking about USC at the time,” Corral said. “By the time we got to the McDonald’s [High School All-American] game we were really good friends.”
There are striking differences between Corral and Gilbreath.
Corral, a point guard who is equal parts scorer and distributor, holds the school record for career three-pointers.
Gilbreath is a quick, athletic slasher who earned Pac-10 Co-Defensive Player of the Year last season.
Yet the two have forged a rare connection on and off the court and, in the process, played their way into the history books.
“We have a special bond that nobody else does,” Gilbreath said. “There were only three of us in our freshmen class.”
The third member of that freshman class, redshirt sophomore forward Michelle Jenkins, has been plagued by injuries during her time at USC, leaving Corral and Gilbreath to develop an on-court relationship that borders on telepathic.
“There’s something about Bri where I always know where she’s going to be,” Corral said. “If I’m driving to the basket or in trouble, I know Bri will be there. Over the past three years our chemistry is so strong we know where each other is going to be all the time.”
A versatile guard who can lead the team in rebounding one game and assists the next, Gilbreath’s career at USC has been marked by consistency.
She started all 32 games her freshman year, earning conference Freshman of the Year and establishing herself as a fixture on the team.
“Growing up, my dad kept [my sister Stephanie and I] in the gym,” Gilbreath said. “He always told us, ‘If you’re not in the gym, somebody else is. Everybody is getting better every day and you have to be right there with them.’”
Corral’s experience was different. Stuck behind eventual WNBA draftee Camille LeNoir, she spent a good part of her freshman season watching from the bench.
Corral started three games that season, averaging just under nine points and three assists per outing.
“I had to watch from the sidelines,” Corral said. “[Camille] was a great leader and example. She taught me a lot of things.”
Despite their different backgrounds, the pair’s uncanny connection has helped both members of USC’s starting backcourt reach a rare milestone: 1,000 career points.
Earlier this season, Gilbreath became the 22nd player in school history to pass the mark. Two weeks later, Corral reached the plateau by draining a baseline three-pointer against Oregon State.
The milestone puts Corral and Gilbreath among select company. Some of the biggest names in the history of college basketball, from Cheryl Miller and Lisa Leslie to Tina Thompson and Cynthia Cooper, all scored more than 1,000 points in their time at USC.
In a sports culture that too often emphasizes individual accomplishments, Corral and Gilbreath seem to represent a basic ethos of basketball: get recognition by scoring points.
But few people who have watched the pair play would accuse them of being selfish.
Along with redshirt senior guard Jacki Gemelos, Corral and Gilbreath refer to themselves as the “three-headed monster.”
Each is capable of and willing to help the team by any means necessary.
Some nights that means scoring the ball; other nights it means making plays for others.
“You try not to think about it,” Corral said. “You set your own personal goals at the beginning of the season but it’s all about the team. We wouldn’t have the point totals we do without our teammates setting us up.”
Corral and Gilbreath refuse to let individual accomplishments distract them from their ultimate goal: making the NCAA tournament for the first time since the 2005-2006 season.
“It’s nice when you have individual accomplishments but I’d be happier about this if we make it to the tournament,” Gilbreath said. “It’s kinda 50-50 on how we feel about it as individuals.”

Despite losing three of its last six regular-season games, the USC women’s basketball team enters the Pac-10 tournament with a strong chance of earning a postseason bid.
All-around player · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath is a consistent offensive and defensive force for USC. This week, she was named to the All-Pac-10 team for the second straight season and Pac-10 All-Defensive Team for the third straight time. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
First up for the Women of Troy (18-11, 10-8) is a game against Washington State, a team they beat twice during the regular season.
Last week, USC overcame a second-half deficit to take down the Cougars (8-22, 6-12) at the Galen Center.
“Washington State is a hot team,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “They have some guards who can shoot the ball. One thing we have on our side is that the game is being played at the Galen Center.”
Cooper says his team is peaking at the right time. In their final regular season game, the Women of Troy blew a double-digit halftime lead against Washington, but rallied to win in overtime.
“Two weeks ago we might have lost that game,” Cooper said. “We’re excited because we ended [the season] on a positive note. We hold our destiny in our hands and have a chance to get into the tournament.”
All season long, the Women of Troy have pointed to 20 wins as the benchmark for earning a postseason berth.
Last season, USC won 19 games and was denied a tournament bid.
Reaching that number will be made more difficult by the absence of junior guard and all-conference performer Ashley Corral, who will serve the second game of her suspension tonight against the Cougars. Corral was suspended before the Washington game for violating team rules.
In her place, USC will rely on redshirt senior guard Jacki Gemelos and freshman guard Len’Nique Brown. Gemelos, who started handling the ball more as the season progressed, gives the Women of Troy a versatile threat at point guard.
“[Gemelos has] done a great job handling the point position,” Cooper said. “We’re going to need her leadership and perimeter shooting.”
Brown, who has played well in limited duty, will be called on to relieve Gemelos at the point.
“Len’Nique just has to play good, steady basketball,” he said. “[We] don’t need her to score 20 points, we just need her to play good defense and get us into our plays.”
If the Women of Troy beat Washington State, they will play the winner of the Arizona-Oregon game. USC split the season series with the Wildcats and swept the Ducks.
Tip-off is scheduled for 5:15 p.m. on Thursday.
Looming after that game is a semifinal clash with  No. 2 Stanford. USC hung tough with the Cardinal last month at the Galen Center and is looking for a repeat performance.
“We know what we need to do,” Gemelos said. “We need two wins in the Pac-10 tournament, and then against Stanford we need to compete and beat them as well.”
Tip-off is at 5 p.m. tonight at the Galen Center.

It seems like the live music industry gets a little worse every year.
At least, that’s the way prominent music publications make it seem.
During its end-of-the-year report, Business Wire reported “2010 was a volatile year for the music industry, which saw many tours canceled and a decline in overall concert ticket sales.”
Popular artists like Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga did well, but many others did not.
Some blame Ticketmaster and Live Nation for dominating the market and charging exorbitant service fees. Others condemn scalpers for scooping up massive amounts of tickets and inflating prices. There’s also the recession.
Yet, despite all these negative factors working against concert ticket sales, festivals seem to be doing just fine. For instance, Coachella announced its lineup online a month or so ago, released tickets less than a week later and had completely sold out less than a week after that.
Some dismissed this quick sale as a mere marketing ploy, believing promoters will release more tickets as the festival date approaches. That smart plan isn’t out of the question, but it’s unlikely.
Much to the dismay of those who failed to acquire tickets quickly enough, the festival’s verified Twitter account cockily announced, “no we don’t have any passes left to release, kthxbye.”
The more likely reason for the quick festival ticket sales is, simply, people are buying tickets.
Fans unwilling to shell out $60 for one night of Christina Aguilera’s bland singing are more than eager to pay hundreds of dollars to see dozens of popular bands during the course of a weekend.
Almost every festival is a great deal, and even tickets nearing the $300 range, like those for Coachella and Bonnaroo, are steals, since single tickets to shows by most of the headliners are relatively expensive. Lady Gaga tickets, for instance, can be up to $181.
Festivals are also a fitting testament to the iPod shuffle mode and overall ADD music generation, since at festivals, music fans get a lot of variety.
Still, it is surprising just how much the festival business has exploded in popularity during the last few years.
Last week, for instance, Pitchfork announced a small portion of the lineup for its Pitchfork Music Festival, held annually in Chicago. It released three-day passes for the festival a couple of days later, and sold out completely in less than 24 hours. Single day passes are still available, but that’s an incredibly quick sell-out for a festival that has yet to announce its full lineup.
In 2006, tickets were still available for the festival a week before it happened. In that inaugural year, the terrifyingly horrific Yoko Ono was the headliner, so that’s not too much of a surprise. But the point is that in just a few short years, the festival has exponentially increased in popularity.
In fact, most festivals have experienced significantly greater success in the last few years.
In 2004, Perry Ferrel’s Lollapalooza tour was canceled after being started in 1991 because of poor ticket sales. After re-establishing itself as a stagnant festival held annually in Chicago the following year, Lollapalooza has grown to become one of the country’s three major festivals.
Other festivals have enjoyed similar popularity, and there now seems to be a prominent and well attended music festival in almost every major U.S. city at some point throughout the year.
Yet, from year to year, festivals seem to feature incredibly similar headliners. All of Coachella’s headliners have played the festival at least once before, and many of the acts cross over among the prominent fests.
Only time will tell whether or not these recurring acts will cause the festival business to grow stale and decline in the same way the single ticket concert industry appears to be doing.
For the most part, though, there’s enough variety from year to year that things stay interesting, and, at least for a while, festivals will continue to sell tickets.
This year we’ve already seen Bonnaroo, Sasquatch, Coachella, Ultra and Pitchfork three-day passes sell out extremely quickly. Right now, festivals seem to be a saving grace in an otherwise dying industry.
Will Hagle is a sophomore majoring in narrative studies. His column, “Feedback,” runs Wednesdays. 
Unfortunately, many of those mid-size and smaller festivals do not pay talent. If their overall festival budgets are cut, entertainment is the first thing to go. Or they blow their budget on one national act and any other acts they secure play for free. Many festivals no longer exist due to the state of the economy. There are some larger festivals with side stages that actually charge the bands/musicians to perform on them. It really is tough out there right now, even with festivals if you are not a national act.
Interesting article that touches upon a lot of truths (and some wild rumours) in the music business today. 
Another trend is that instead of paying huge prices for tickets people are turning to alternative venues and styles of music where tickets are reasonable and they can still enjoy a good evening of live music.
Although the larger festivals in my genre of music tend to top-load with national acts, many successful mid-size and small festivals are doing just fine by bringing in regional talent and keeping their costs (and tickets prices) at a reasonable level.  I have seen more than one poll lately where people attend festivals more for the overall experience than to see specific bands.  
Live music is not dying, it’s simply changing to match the economy and the times.

The Los Angeles Opera’s production of Rossini’s classic Il Turco in Italia, or The Turk in Italy, performed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, has everything an audience can possibly hope for: love, lust, scandal, marriage and divorce.
What a character · The Turk of Italy brings together an amalgam of characters that create a complex story that reels the viewer in. The plot pits one woman against her husband, a suitor and a new love interest. - Photo courtesy of LA Opera  
The story, originally written by Rossini back in the 1800s, was initially disliked and seen as a jab at Italians because the main character cheats on her husband with a Turkish man.
The audience first sees Fiorilla, the opera’s primadonna, played by the vivacious soprano Nino Machaidze, in a romantic rendezvous with the aptly named Narciso (Maxim Mironov), the narcissistic character, who wears a costume reminiscent of Danny Zuko from Grease.
The opera has barely begun when fickle Fiorilla casts off poor Narciso for bigger and better men.
Narciso is too full of himself and Mironov does a great job of portraying this cocky, overconfident character.
The audience first sees Selim Damelec, the Turkish prince, he floats in on a Turkish magic carpet. Selim is portrayed by the bass-baritone Simone Alberghini, a powerful, strong-voiced singer.
With Selim’s entrance, the story turns to Fiorilla’s attempt to escape her dreary marriage and get rid of Narciso to pursue the affection of Selim.
Sparks fly between Fiorilla and Selim, whose relationship was mirrored by definite chemistry of the lovely Machaidze and handsome Alberghini.
Don Geronio (Paolo Gavanelli), is Fiorilla’s betrayed husband, the man to be pitied. A short, portly, elderly man, Gavanell’s acting manages to put the audience in a dilemma as to whether to root for the Italian or the outsider Turk.
The show is tied together by a poet named Prosdocimo who begins the story by trying to find his muse. Prosdocimo (Thomas Allen), a de facto narrator, is a meddlesome character, but one listeners cannot help but adore. Allen’s realization of Prosdocimo is wonderful, enough of an everyman that audience members can place themselves within the opera’s main plot-line.
The costume department does a good job throughout the work of bringing the characters to life. Selim makes the audience swoon with his over-the-top, pseudo-Armani suit and Ray-Ban-esque shades.
During a later masquerade scene, Selim, Narciso and Geronio don red Turkish caps and white cotton tunics, all looking quite hilarious. Zaida and Fiorilla, meanwhile, wear bright gold outfits with headpieces that look like dragonflies.
The actors share strong chemistry and create believable characters.
The opera spices things up by including a couple of convincing yet hilarious fight scenes. Geronio, donning silky green boxer shorts and boxing gloves, challenges Selim, wearing similar red shorts and his own gloves, to a fight for his revenge in one of the funniest scenes.
Both were hyped as if in a boxing ring, and it was as funny and as ridiculous as Celebrity Boxing.
Soon enough, Zaida and Fiorilla are at it like their male counterparts, nearly clawing each other’s eyes out and kicking each other’s heads in. The choreography was laugh-out-loud funny yet masterfully done, and the scene retains the fun mood throughout.
Rossini’s music, led by James Conlon and wonderfully performed by the cast  and orchestra, was exceptional. It had the flourish and lyricism needed to showcase the magnificent voices that graced the stage of the opera house.
Each singer became his character and there was great chemistry between the performers.
Machaidze stole the show with her sensational voice, her dance moves and her flirtation, winning the audience over from the very first note. Alberghini later commented that they “had a lot of fun” and the actors made it seem so, creating a fun experience for the audience as well.
“Il Turco in Italia” will have its final performances this Thursday and Sunday. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is located on 135 N. Grand Ave.

Spring break can be a cruel mistress. As many of our friends book round-trip flights to Cancun and St. Barts, those of us living on a slimmer budget are faced with a foreboding dilemma: how to spend our time at home.
For those 21 or older, consider the escapist benefits of imported beers. Packed with amorous medleys of spices and hops, sporting chic bottle designs and sometimes bearing dust from their native lands. Non-domestic drinks can offer the same joie de vivre as a trip to Moscow or Machu Picchu, for a fraction of the cost.
Trois Pistoles – Chambly, Quebec, Canada.
Cusquena Peruvian Lager – Lima, Peru
 
  
 
 

Pizarro might have conquered the Incas, but some grains of Incan innovation remain in Cusquena, one of Peru’s top exported lagers.
   
 
Like many Latin American cervezas, Cusquena errs on the lighter side, with only the mildest hint of bitter hops. Its malt content, however, is surprisingly seductive, lending the golden beer an inherent taste of freshly baked scones that similar lagers, like Mexico’s Pacifico and Costa Rica’s Imperial, lack. The beer is also the only Latin American beverage brewed under the German Purity Law of 1516, which dictated that water, barley and hops were the only suitable ingredients for beer.
Cusquena is regularly available at BevMo locations and can make a subtly salacious accompaniment to a picnic or any South American cuisine, particularly ceviche.
Spaten Optimator – Munich, Germany
 
 
   
 

 
   
 
 
    
 
As Vince “Shamwow” Offer once taught us, the Germans are generally known to “make good stuff.” Indeed, Munich’s Spaten Optimator doppelbock, one of the most commonly available imported beers in Los Angeles, might be the cheapest alternative to a trip to Deutschland.
      
  
 
 
 
  
Bearing a whopping 7.2 percent alcohol content and packed with enough molasses and malt extract for two loaves of bread, the Optimator is breakfast in a bottle. Guaranteed to make the clouds or club lights appear fuzzy, this exemplary doppelbock still drinks with the same sweetness and simplicity as a mug of hot chocolate.
One can generally find Optimator at Trader Joe’s and BevMo, but purists are strongly advised to get the beer on tap at Downtown’s Wurstküche, with some juicy bockwurst and truffle oil fries on the side.
 
Old Rasputin – Fort Bragg, Calif.
 
 
   
 

 
   
 
 
 
   
 
  
  
   
 
Still don’t believe any Russian can drink you under the table? Try tossing back an Old Rasputin and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
        
  
  
  
 
  
   
  
 
It’s not actually brewed in the monk’s homeland, but this Russian-style imperial stout is a well-endowed beast of a beer. Dark as midnight and spiked with coffee, chocolate and hints of smoke, Old Rasputin’s initial docility hides a surprisingly potent aftertaste. In its final moments, the beer’s nine percent alcohol content reveals itself, actually resembling the sting of a vodka shot.
Thankfully, you won’t have to travel far to get your hands on one of these bad boys. The Lab Gastropub serves Old Rasputin by the bottle and cold as the ice of Yakutsk.
Pilsner Urquell –  Pilsen, Czech RepublicReaders of Sports Illustrated will argue that the Czech Republic’s finest export is not a beverage, but even those who remember Petra Nemcova’s first spread will experience a crisis of faith when presented with Pilsner Urquell.
Boasting the same golden tan as any lager but wielding a complex, non-bitter harvest of hops, this wildly popular beer is a sensorial rush that goes down smooth as velvet. We should expect no less from a nation whose soil has been scientifically proven to be the best in the world for hop growing, and whose businessmen will often wash down their morning muesli with a glass of beer.
Pilsner Urquell can be bought at Ralphs, BevMo and Trader Joe’s, and is also served at The Lab Gastropub.

My parents, who emigrated from India, raised me to respect the myriad of cultures that make up the distinct flavor of this country. They raised me to value American opportunities.
For 21 years I never doubted whether I belong. I never doubted my right to call America my home — until recently — when Andrew Breitbart’s calculated assault on multiculturalism at the USC College Republicans meeting [Feb. 16] left me in tears, feeling like my family and anyone like us is unwanted. He called multiculturalism a conspiracy, a fake American value.
He is wrong. Breitbart’s problem stems from the debate between pluralism and multiculturalism when in reality, multiculturalism is pluralism.
Pluralism represents that American assumption that immigrants would eventually disappear into “the melting pot” of American ideas. Multiculturalism, on the other hand, is often misrepresented as the notion that immigrant groups refuse to be part of the wider community.  Breitbart’s hostility stems from this misconception. His resentment dates back to the wartime refugees who were fleeing death during World War II.
What Breitbart does not understand is that the immigrants back then, as well as the others that followed throughout the last century, wholeheartedly embraced their new land, working hard to be accepted and to achieve their American dreams, even at great costs. Yet, they also retained important parts of their culture that they then shared. Thus, the American people naturally adapted and expanded their horizons. I am proud of the rich perspectives and understanding that multiculturalism provides.
It took some time to fully recover from the shock of Breitbart’s words and repulsion in his face as he looked at me. But I am comforted by the Americans before me who were willing to accept and foster diversity as a quintessential American value.
We are America. Tell Mr. Breitbart I won’t be packing my bags anytime soon.

A friend of mine posted this on facebook in response to the article.  “Perhaps its time for all you individuals who love to name-call and fling around the words “racist, (insert)phobic, (insert)ist” to open up your minds and not be so quick to denounce those who hold opinions differing from your own.”
He brings up a fascinating point, which is why I would implore everyone to tell Breitbart and co. to stop flinging around words like (social)ist, (marx)ist, and (commun)ist in efforts to denounce those who have different philosophical opinions by linking them to movements which evoke emotions of fear and hatred because of the events surrounding WWII. It was Breitbarts hypocrisy and his blatant assault on “the others,” whether that was other cultures, or people with other philsophical beliefs, that got under my skin. It was one stereotype after another followed by a long-line of conspiracies that did nothing but polarize our nation. There were no tangible solutions offered up to any problems, just finger pointing and what felt like hate speech. Let me share a few of his bulletpoints that I recalled from the lecture.
Multiculturalism wasn’t inherently good.
All humanities departments are part of the liberal attempt to take over the education system.
Academics fleeing Europe because of Nazi persecution came to American and wrote scathing critiques of the culture and tried to take over America.
The two pillars of the country are capitalism and Judeo-christianity.
He repeatedly called himself petty, and chose his major by asking three attractive young ladies outside his house what they thought he should study, and that’s how he ended up an American Studies major. He said it should have been called ‘Anti-American’ studies.
He said that after 9/11 that liberals were trying to destroy the unity of America by protesting against War.
Liberals true strength lies in their ability to control popular culture (Hollywood, music, the media, etc). He said that he just wanted to make sure that conservatives in Hollywood weren’t being persecuted for their beliefs.
Rush Limbaugh was one of his primary inspirations.
He repeatedly made references to liberals as communists, socialists, marxists, etc., and then got mad when people called him “an -it – racist, sexist…”
His life was like Glenn Beck’s Chalkboard.
Liberal teachers brainwash their students… there was no opportunity for middleground or discussion.
When I mentioned fear mongering and the ‘us-them’ dynamic he was creating, I said that he spoke with such anger in his voice, he corrected me and said it was passion and that he was just speaking the truth.
He said that when Keith Olbermann was suspended from MSNBC, that he defended Keith and his freedom of expression (making it seem like he was open to both sides).
He said that he was immune to criticism from the acorn video controversy because he posted the transcripts on his website (where? why does that create protection?…)
He’s an intentionally confrontational figure because that’s what sells, and that’s what gets him paid. its hard to have a conversation with someone who tries to link me with Nazis with no real agenda other than it pays the bills.
This is one of those times when hours could be spent on an issue, and i’ve validated him too much already by giving up so much time and pain because of him.  I would have never instigated a conversation about “the truth” in the Acorn scam if it wasn’t for him saying that linking liberals to ‘socialists, communists, marxists,etc’ was the truth. All he does is light fires, get paid to fan those flames, and then receive funds to cleanup and build on the land that he burnt down.  Yes I was emotionally compromised after seeing the women I love in tears through his speech, and I played right into his game.  He is a master of instigating emotion and used his experience to put us in a corner in a compromising position to force us into a public conversation, and maybe it sounded like I was repeating the same question, but that was cause I wanted to know whether he felt any guilt in his role in the deception of Americans through these fraudulantly misleading tapes (Acorn, Shirley Sherod, etc…).  When you’ve been insulted the entire night and your girlfriend feels as though she is being blatantly discriminated against, its hard to keep your cool and he has mcuh more experience competiting in yelling matches on a public forum since its what he does for a living.  He said it himself that he’s a-political, so that must mean that he is just a bully for the money.  And oh, how he’s good at that.
Proud of you Tiffany for defending what you stand for!
LISTEN ALL YOU ignorant privileged white males, 
If you have NEVER known what it’s like to be apart of  anything that is oppressed, maybe you should open your minds  to the fact that you cannot avoid the responsibility that your past has given to you, Instead of getting defensive, how about you stay open and break that assumption? THIS opinion is valid, no matter what you say or think.  Please try thinking from someone else’s point of view, which I can only imagine how little you of that concept. 
Also, know that getting through life with this blatant disrespect and ability to actually CHOOSE ignorance over understanding and listening,
This person’s article is so articulate and exposing that is deserves respect. It doesn’t seem like many people noticed that.  Do you think it’s easy to claim that opinion, because it certainly seems easy for you to put it down. 
Try going to another country and feel what it’s like to feel out of place, and ignore the values that America is REALLY supposed to be based on and maybe try learning something rather than already shutting up everyone else, 
Keep pushing it away and it will come back, this is a WORLD issue, if you choose to stay in your bubble than get the hell off of this website.
Multiculturalism is a sham. How different in culture are your German Jewish refugee-descended friend whose ancestors came over during WWII and your Russian refugee-descended friend whose ancestors came over slightly before WWII? Not very different.
The idea of America being a patchwork of different ethnicity dominated neighborhoods is the segregationist’s dream, so although you may be trying to sound like a liberal sweetheart, the implications of your ideas are horrendous. You are receiving a bunch of support from a bunch of FOB people who are afraid to adopt an American identity and let America change them, preferring to just have their ethnic group change mainstream American culture in a one-way exchange. I call BS! I don’t think so!
You are just indignant because you don’t understand what the melting pot implies. A salad bowl just sounds nicer to be in. Sorry (just a saying, I’m not really sorry) you will be BOILED IN THE STEW ALRIGHT! American culture is a product of a melting pot! Those who seem particularist are just NOT FULLY COOKED.
good on you for standing up to small-minded twits
Personally, I was not at this meeting so I can’t comment as to the specifics of what happened there. I identify myself as a conservative at USC, however being rational always supersedes my politics. In my attempt at an objective assessment of Breitbart, I arrive at the following conclusions: I applaud his efforts in furthering gay rights–earlier this year he joined the advisory committee of GOProud (A Republican gay rights group). That being said, there are issues I have with his methods in the past as well– specifically some inflammatory comments made by him after Senator Ted Kennedy’s death. Regardless of how one feels about the Senator, I think all would agree it’s in poor taste to call someone “a special pile of human excrement” immediately following their passing. That is not to say that he is unaccomplished–He will likely go down as one of the individuals credited with helping transition media from a purely print-driven medium to one that is more accessible.
What I do find to be the case though, is that perfectly reasonable journalists (of any political stripe) tend to turn into inflammatory zealots when placed on TV because that’s what drives ratings. The problem is exacerbated because there is no doubt that Breitbart is a competent journalist who uses the spotlight as a bully pulpit. And although there is no concrete evidence that I can find on the matter, the allegations that Breitbart slings out racial slurs seem to come up too frequently to be dismissed as random or unfounded.
Although the ACORN scandal was highly embarrassing everyone involved, Giles and O’Keefe appear to be the only ones with an “agenda” as Diane (see below) put it. I try to give FoxNews and Breitbart the benefit of the doubt when bringing us the news because frankly, I don’t want to believe that conservative journalists would be complicit in something that petty.
This whole issue speaks to a bigger problem–I don’t care to call out Breitbart myself, Tiffany has already done so and Breitbart’s track record will allow individuals to reach their own conclusions.
Who I do want to call out is the USC College Republicans. As I said before, I myself am a conservative, but am not a member of this group for a very specific reason. I am highly disappointed in the lack of quality speakers that are invited to our campus. Instead, we get inflammatory, closed-minded individuals like Ann Coulter. There is no room for positive discourse when the people we invite to speak represent not only the most extreme polarized version of a general class of political beliefs, but also happen to be, more often than not, talking heads trying to get airtime on daytime news programs. At a university like USC, and with conservatives trying to bolster support for the upcoming election, there should be no problem with getting articulate, reasonable speakers to come voice their opinions to USC students. I notice that there was not an intense level of controversy when the College Republicans invited Mitt Romney to speak here in 2008. This is because Mr. Romney is a legitimate participator in the governmental process–a former governor and graduate of Harvard Law School. More often however, the College Republicans invite a sideline observers to the process who pontificate and create inflammatory remarks to drive eyeballs to the TV. Of course Breitbart was going to create controversy–he has built his career on it.

Tiffany there are cranks everywhere – we have a fair share of these in India. The bad thing is that the cranks make a lot of sound just to be heard and they ARE heard by many; the good thing is that their ideas and the noise they make are soon forgotten, until another crank steps up. The best way to deal with cranks is to laugh at their ideas. They are so full of their own importance that laughter pricks their bubble and they collapse like a hot air balloon. I am proud of you and they well reasoned article you wrote..
Personally, I was not at this meeting so I can’t comment as to the specifics of what happened there. I identify myself as a conservative at USC, however being rational always supersedes my politics. In my attempt at an objective assessment of Breitbart, I arrive at the following conclusions: I applaud his efforts in furthering gay rights–earlier this year he joined the advisory committee of GOProud (A Republican gay rights group). That being said, there are issues I have with his methods in the past as well– specifically some inflammatory comments made by him after Senator Ted Kennedy’s death. Regardless of how one feels about the Senator, I think all would agree it’s in poor taste to call someone “a special pile of human excrement” immediately following their passing. That is not to say that he is unaccomplished–He will likely go down as one of the individuals credited with helping transition media from a purely print-driven medium to one that is more accessible.
What I do find to be the case though, is that perfectly reasonable journalists (of any political stripe) tend to turn into inflammatory zealots when placed on TV because that’s what drives ratings. The problem is exacerbated because there is no doubt that Breitbart is a competent journalist who uses the spotlight as a bully pulpit. And although there is no concrete evidence that I can find on the matter, the allegations that Breitbart slings out racial slurs seem to come up too frequently to be dismissed as random or unfounded.
Although the ACORN scandal was highly embarrassing everyone involved, Giles and O’Keefe, appear to be the only ones with an “agenda” as Diane (see below) put it. I try to give FoxNews and Breitbart the benefit of the doubt when bringing us the news because frankly, I don’t want to believe that conservative journalists would be complicit in something that petty.
This whole issue speaks to a bigger issue–I don’t care to call out Breitbart myself, Tiffany has already done so and Breitbart’s track record will allow individuals to reach their own conclusions.
Who I do want to call out is the USC College Republicans. As I said before, I myself am a conservative, but am not a member of this group for a very specific reason. I am highly disappointed in the lack of quality speakers that are invited to our campus. Instead, we get inflammatory, closed-minded individuals like Ann Coulter. There is no room for positive discourse when the people we invite to speak represent not only the most extreme polarized version of a general class of political beliefs, but also happen to be, more often than not, talking heads trying to get airtime on daytime news programs. At a university like USC, and with conservatives trying to bolster support for the upcoming election, there should be no problem with getting articulate, reasonable speakers to come voice their opinions to USC students. I notice that there was not an intense level of controversy when the College Republicans invited Mitt Romney to speak here in 2008. This is because Mr. Romney is a legitimate participator in the governmental process–a former governor and graduate of Harvard Law School. More often however, the College Republicans invite a sideline observers to the process who pontificate and create inflammatory remarks to drive eyeballs to the TV. Of course Breitbart was going to create controversy–he has built his career on it.

Tiffany, your comments make clear that you attended this meeting with an agenda already firmly implanted in your head, and you “heard” what you wanted to hear. Breitbart is not interested in making you leave the country, so your implication that that’s the case is just ludicrous. What’s more, you indicate that you are either unable or unwilling to understand his point. Since he’s a pretty clear communicator, I lay that on you, not him. You can twist and distort his point all you want, but that doesn’t make it so. You are guilty of gross mis-characterization.
“SC BRO”….thank you for your comment.  However, my article was in response to what I heard and took direct notes on right after and to the way the Daily Trojan article you stated.  
And if you remember correctly “I” did not ask ANY questions about the ACORN video or say anything about  that at all.  That was my friend.  After that Breitbart started referring to the both of us as the same person as he got angry.  I had no intent on asking any questions at all actually but got increasingly disturbed throughout the talk and felt we had to say something after he addressed us directly…which why would he put us on the spot as the “other”.  
This is what happens…why are you so quick to label me as part of a larger group as part of another.  I said nothing of how anyone else in the room reacted or that they have a part in this at all.  I specifically am reacting to how Breitbart made me feel taking into account the things that he said…his opening remarks about multiculturalism and the way he started labeling “us.”  Also did it cross your mind that perhaps I did not agree with his labeling of those refugees which he aptly labeled as “eggheads.”  
About this not being “journalism”….funny…because it’s an opinion piece…also funny because there are a lot of people who don’t consider Breibart (or his idol Beck or any highly sensational talking head on any “side” for that matter) as journalists.  Yet here we are….
Thank You Daily Trojan for letting me speak my mind.
I was there. Breitbart did nothing wrong. You acted like a pathetic, ignorant little kid.
Grow up.
As someone who was in that room, I refuse to accept this smear of Mr Breitbart who said nothing liking to your portrayal of immigrants as unwanted. As a grandkid of immigrants I would have taken very harshly to words of that sort. And I will use a quote from Breitbart (unlike you) “immigrants are the hardest working among us.” The nice thing about America–you don’t have to agree with his philosophy of the media and liberal agenda. But to akin your understanding of the evening to this is disgraceful.
To relate his resentment of specific individuals who fled Germany to infiltrate the American University system with radical opinions  to a resentment of immigrants is blatantly false. Breitbart was speaking of specific individuals who fled Germany to America and infiltrated the American University system with unfound doctrinal beliefs that are still taught today in some circles.
DailyTrojan, I implore you to redact this editorial as false unless she can provide concrete evidence. I also ask you to reflect upon the non-editorial article written the day afterwards.
You cried in that room–the rest of us could not figure out why. He was not hostile toward you; you asked him questions, or I should say one question: “why were the videos of Acorn doctored?” You (and the guy you were with) refused to accept his answer and asked the same question at least three times. His full answer was “go on to my website to view the full audio and video transcripts.” After you began crying, and threw the room for a loop of a surprise, Breitbart asked the room rhetorically and half-heartedly joking to ease the sudden tension “Do any of you not want this girl in here?” The question was received with an audible no and a visual shaking of the heads in the room. No one would have ever asked you to leave the room because we felt at odds. You did, however, choose to leave the room shortly after you gave up trying to get a different answer out of Breitbart.
I respect your opinion, but if you are going to smear Breitbart with false, and unfounded allegations that is not journalism at all, and I don’t have to be a Journalism major to figure that out.
I’m glad you find yourself here in America and won’t be leaving anytime soon, my grandparents did the same and I appreciate their choice every day of my life!
Tiffany, this is America. The great thing about it is extremist morons like Breitbart are in the minority, or at least we hope. Thank you for your piece. Always know: there is another side in this land of a lot of different people that doesn’t support cement heads like this :-)

It’s been popular to hate the Miami Heat this year.
The championship parade before they even played a game and their early season struggles made them easy targets for critics from the beginning.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
So when Heat players cried in the locker room after a regular season loss to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday, fans and other players were quick to jump on the bandwagon.
But rather than trying to emasculate these players, fans should appreciate the Heat’s competitive spirit in a world where sports is dominated by apathy and money.
Fans value players who pride themselves on winning — it’s why Kobe Bryant is the most popular player on the Lakers.
In the NBA, you rarely see a group become emotional about a win or loss.
But the Heat have not proven themselves against most of the top teams in the league, and after suffering another close defeat, they were understandably emotional.
Maybe coach Erik Spoelstra shouldn’t have revealed that players were crying, but fans shouldn’t be quick to criticize Heat players for that emotion. It at least shows they were giving maximum effort — something many players can’t say about themselves.
Miami is a team unlike most others in the NBA. Most of the players were not just lumped together as draft picks or random free agent signings.
These players chose to play together in Miami, and therefore have a collective interest in winning together. They need to win because the stakes they created for themselves are much higher.
They weren’t crying Sunday because they lost. They were crying because they have been collectively failing to achieve the goals they had for the regular season.
LeBron James and Dwayne Wade haven’t played off of each other’s energy to the degree they hoped they would, and that discord has hurt the team, especially in the closing minutes of games, when one player usually takes over.
Both superstars have been afraid to assert themselves, and the harsh reality of their apparently ideal situation is kicking in.
They might not have been the ones crying, but their failures are part of the reason players cried in the first place.
The players’ emotion was caused by frustration and competitive fire; that emotion is a great byproduct of sports on the rare occasion it is displayed.
Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan and Tim Tebow have become famous for crying after huge wins, and they are celebrated for it.
Yet, when the Heat cry, they are deemed immature and mentally weak.
The media sensationalized a story that really had no place in the national news.
There is no reason for crying to be unacceptable. Yes, the NBA (as deemed by retired player and notorious enforcer Charles Oakley) is a “grown man’s game.”
But crying because you lost doesn’t make you any less of a man. Emotion does not equate to weakness — this is a concept the media has failed to understand.
Hopefully, fans around the nation will not succumb to the same judgement the media makes of our athletes.
The Heat’s early celebration before the season may have been overdone. But when it comes to the game  itself, athletes are out there — on the court, field or arena — to do their job. And we can only hope that our athletes, whom gain our attention on a daily basis, are passionate about their jobs. Otherwise, there
It’s not that there should necessarily be more crying in sports — it’s more that there is a place for it. Those who say otherwise are taking a near-sighted and generally shallow view of the place of emotion in sports.

What would you do if someone offered you $100,000 to drop out of college?
Of course, such a gift would come with some strings attached. In this case, you’d need a really good idea and the ability to measure risk.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Peter Thiel, a 43-year-old entrepreneur and venture capitalist, is offering $100,000 fellowships to 20 entrepreneurs under the age of 20, on the condition that they drop out of college for two years to create start-ups.
Thiel himself graduated from Stanford with a degree in philosophy, and later earned a J.D. from Stanford Law School. He co-founded PayPal and has made his fortune investing in risky and slightly out-of-the-box ventures (Thiel was the first outside investor in Facebook).
Now he’s looking for the next wave of young entrepreneurial superstars — people whose ideas will revolutionize industries and push technological boundaries.
“Our world needs more breakthrough technologies,” Thiel wrote on the fellowship’s website. “From Facebook to SpaceX to Halcyon Molecular, some of the world’s most transformational technologies were created by people who dropped out of school because they had ideas that couldn’t wait until graduation.”
Thiel’s experiment is an interesting idea, but for most students it is not the best choice.
There are certainly a number of success stories about college dropouts who made it big.
Steve Jobs left Reed College after only one semester to launch Apple. Not only did Paul Allen drop out of Washington State University, but he was able to convince his buddy Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard so they could start Microsoft. Facebook, Dreamworks and Twitter all were founded by guys who dropped out of college.
The moral of the story seems to be that if you have a genius idea, don’t let college get in the way. But the key assumption here is that you have a genius idea and the skills to back it up.
Bill Gates didn’t just drop out of college looking to wing it.
In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell explains how Gates had the incredible opportunity to attend a private school in Seattle that owned its own ASR-33 Teletype computer, a state-of-the-art machine that transformed computer programming from a laborious punch-code process into the efficient real-time process.
As Gladwell points out, this was 1968 and most colleges didn’t even have computer clubs.
“By the time Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to try his hand at running his own software company, he’d been programming practically nonstop for seven consecutive years,” Gladwell wrote.
Bill Gates would have been wasting his time by staying in college. He already had a vision and the skills to make that vision work.
For a young entrepreneur itching to start a venture, it comes down to evaluating the opportunity cost.
There is something to be said about not letting your idea sit for too long and risking missing the market or losing your motivation. But there is probably more to be said for acquiring the skills and networks that only come by way of a full college education.
“If anybody’s got an idea, they should do it as quickly as they can,” said William Crookston, a professor of clinical entrepreneurship at USC.
But he points out that this doesn’t require dropping out of school. Successful companies have been launched from the dorm room before.
Most young entrepreneurs would be better off finishing school. They can receive feedback and criticism from experienced professors and can learn beneficial skills like management and analysis. In the end, they will still have their ideas, and they’ll be able to develop stronger products and launch more stable companies.
“Age 28 to 35 is the sweet spot for entrepreneurs,” Crookston said.
At this point in their lives, entrepreneurs will likely have one or two failures under their belts, which is a type of “depth that only comes with years,” he explained.
For the average young entrepreneur, the best bet is to launch a venture while still in school. If it takes off and you are making millions of dollars, drop school and go for it. If it flops, at least you will still have your degree — and your dignity.

Two alleged gang members, Travon Reed and Horasio Kimbrough, are headed to trial tomorrow to face charges in the 2008 non-fatal shooting of USC track star Bryshon Nellum.
Nellum, who was 19 at the time of the shooting, was shot in both thighs and one hamstring, while he was leaving a Halloween Party at Leonardo’s Club and Restaurant on Vermont and 28th Street.
Reed and Kimbrough are suspected gang members, but Nellum’s family insists that Nellum was not involved in any gang related activities and had no known enemies at the time.
At the time of the shooting Nellum was the fastest 19-and-under 400 meter sprinter in the world, according to Ron Allice, USC’s director of track and field.
Nellum, who graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in 2007, held the nationwide high school record for the 200 and 400 sprints. Nellum was also named Gatorade National Boys Track and Field Athlete of the Year for the 2006-2007 season.
After the shooting Nellum underwent surgery at California Hospital Medical Center.
Nellum was able to successfully complete physical therapy and remains a sprinter on the Track and Field Team.
The trial will be held at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center on 210 West Temple St.

After being admitted to USC University Hospital March 3 for an undisclosed illness, senior defensive end Armond Armstead was released from the hospital on Tuesday, according to a release issued by the school.
“I’m very happy to report that Armond was released from the hospital today,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “He is back with us, but he will not resume conditioning workouts until the results of all his medical tests are completed. The doctors and staff at USC University Hospital and our team doctors and athletic trainers have been exceptional and I want to thank them for that.”
He will not, however, participate in the team’s offseason conditioning workouts until the results from his tests are made known.
“My family and I want to thank everybody for their thoughts and prayers,” Armstead said.  “I heard from so many people and I really appreciate their support.  I also want to thank the USC doctors for their great medical care.  These past few days, I really experienced the power of the Trojan Family.”
Armstead, who finished with 43 tackles and three sacks last season, will begin attending class this week.
“I feel good, my spirits are up,” Armstead said, “I’m ready to go back to class.
USC begins spring practice March 22.

After spending the latter half of 2010 recording new material in Los Angeles, alternative rock band Taking Back Sunday excited fans with the prospect of a new album featuring their original line-up.
In April, the band was reduced from a five-piece to a three-piece outfit until they made the announcement that the two original members, John Nolan (guitar/vocals) and Shaun Cooper (bass) would be rejoining the band.
Fans immediately became excited because it implied that the band would be returning to its older sound from their debut release in 2000, Tell All Your Friends, especially after 2009’s New Again proved to be a disappointment.
Constantly updating fans about their studio happenings, the band announced that some possible song titles include “Sad Saviour,” “You Were Right,” “Don’t Lose Faith in Me,” “The Best Places to be a Mom” and “Money.” Additionally, Adam Lazzara (lead vocals) teased fans by saying that a song called “El Paso” was the heaviest rock track the band has ever written.
Instead of announcing news regarding the album, the band has instead announced a small string of shows on the East Coast and a tour of the United Kingdom throughout April and May. While it may not be what the rabid fans have been yearning to know, it still is a promising announcement because it signals the end of the recording cycle and the beginning of promotion for the release.
Until any official word comes out, all fans can do is wait and try to predict when they will be able to get their hands on the new material.

Woody Allen is known for romanticizing beautiful cities from across the world and has officially chosen Rome for the setting of his next film.
The capital of Italy finds itself alongside a list of cities that have been immortalized in his films, including New York, London, Barcelona and France. Though the plot and casting have yet to be revealed, the film will begin production this summer.
“I love these sophisticated cities. It’s fantastic to have the possibility to work there, like when I shot Manhattan in New York, Match Point in London and Vicky Cristina Barcelona in Barcelona” Allen told La Republicca.
Woody Allen seems to have no plans to return to New York, his beloved home, and has instead decided to uncover the beauty in another European city.
“Each time, it’s like a declaration of love for certain places. I project onto the big screen my feelings for places which count a lot in my life. I hope to do the same thing with Rome” Allen said.
Woody Allen’s latest film, Midnight in Paris, was filmed entirely in France and is scheduled to open the Festival de Cannes on May 11.

The Graduate and Profesional Student Senate elected its 11-member executive board for next year in front of about 50 graduate students Monday night.
Applause · Jenny Novak, the current president of GPSS (left), and president-elect Ryan Estes smile at the audience. Estes served as the social programming director of GPSS and hopes to increase the reach of GPSS. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The new GPSS executive board: Ryan Estes as president, Andrei Pavelescu as vice president, Dushyant Singh as finance director, Jennifer Reynolds as elections/recruitment director, Kara Lemma as social programming director, D’Andre Holland as community and special events director, Arash Saifhashemi as communications director, Alice Bardan as public relations director, Jaclyn Selby as academic affairs director, Yohey Tokumitsu as campus affairs director and Damon De La Cruz as the Health Sciences Campus director.
“I feel very optimistic about what the new executive board will accomplish in the next school year,” said John Shen, a graduate student studying neuroscience.
For each of the 11 positions, there were either one or two candidates. Each candidate had two minutes to give a speech, followed by questioning from current GPSS senators.  The senators could volunteer pros or cons for the particular candidate.
The senate then electronically voted for a candidate (or abstained from the vote). For those positions where there was only one candidate, the candidate still had to receive a majority of the vote.
“I was very impressed with the diversity of the candidates this year,” said Amanda Foran, a PhD candidate in occupational science.
Although all the candidates focused on different issues, there seemed to be a few widespread concerns.
One such issue was the integration of the Health Sciences Campus and the University Park Campus. Candidates for public relations director, communications director and the social programming director all shared concerns that there is a gap between the students and events on both campuses. All candidates promised to bridge that gap by reaching out more to HSC students through social programs and the GPSS website and newsletter.
Another prominent issue was GPSS’s transparency in its financial system and financial committees. Singh, who was elected finance director Monday said he wants to create a Facebook page where all graduate students, and especially GPSS senators, can voice their opinions and questions about the financial situation of GPSS.
“It seems that GPSS is very finance oriented and there are very complicated finance issues that have surfaced in general and specifically at this elections meeting that need to be addressed,” Shen said.
Involvement of online students also proved a hot button issue.
Many candidates, including Estes, said they wanted to see online students be more involved in GPSS and in other graduate student events. Reynolds said she wanted to reach out to more graduate students, including international and online students because they are a part of the graduate community as well.
Although these were not the only issues the candidates addressed, there was a sense of energy about these issues that all the candidates and the senators recognized.
“The candidates represented the student body very well,” Shen said. “There was a lot of enthusiasm and diligence in all of them.”
Nice article Bridget, look forward to learning more about the finance issues and when the travel grant debacle will be sorted!

Christina Ellis, a freshman majoring in fine arts, commutes to her internship in the Fashion District upwards of three times a week. To make that trip, she must pay $53 to fill up her gas tank.
“I fill up my tank less often and really push it,” she said.
Up 14 cents from last week and 50 cents from last month, gas prices in Southern California now rival those found in Alaska and Hawaii, the two states with the highest gas prices in the country.
Southern California gas prices are the highest they have been since 2008, when the state average was $4.61.
Gas prices average $3.91 per gallon for regular gas in the Los Angeles Long Beach area, according to the Automobile Club of Southern California. The price increase has led many students to change their habits.
“Now I pay attention and know which gas stations are less [expensive] than others,” said Kirsten Resha, an undeclared sophomore. “I’m more aware now than ever.”
Resha, who used to commute to her home in Orange County for the weekend, said she is now less likely to make the drive home because of the increased expense.
Students most impacted by the rising prices are those who commute to school every day such as Genevieve Nguyen, a junior majoring in public policy, management and planning.
“I’ve changed my buying patterns,” said Nguyen, who commutes 30 minutes everyday from her home in Little Ethiopia.
Gas stations near USC are no cheaper than those in surrounding areas.
The Chevron on Figueroa  Street charges $3.89 per gallon for regular gas and the United on Pico Boulevard charges $3.87 per gallon for regular gas.
Changing gas stations has helped Nguyen keep costs down.
“I used to buy my gas at Shell, but now I purchase gas at Costco because it saves me three or four dollars,” Nguyen said.
Some students say they are less inclined to leave campus, and instead look for activities in the immediate area.
“I don’t take unnecessary trips and I try to watch my speed more closely because I know it will waste gas in the long run,” said Jeff Stanley, an undeclared freshman. “Before I didn’t think twice about driving, now I ask myself, ‘Do I really want to drive that far?’”
With no sign of a decrease in the near future, many students have begun to rebudget their expenses.
“I don’t offer to drive my friends around because I know I’ll end up paying for gas more when I could put the money toward things I need for school or food expenses,” Ellis said.
Stanley said the rising cost of gas has a huge impact on student life.
“Everyone is feeling it,” Stanley said. “It doesn’t matter if you commute to school, have a job off campus or do activities away from school, you know that everyone is worried about spending extra money.”
Get a bicycle and ride there.  At 2 miles, it should take you about 15 minutes, comparable with taking a bus.  If your employer in the fashion district is nice, they’ll let you bring the bike inside and you won’t have to pay one cent for parking.   And of course, you won’t have to pay one cent for gasoline either.
Save the car for when you have to transport something heavy.
GO METRO! As a Native NYC’er who attended USC 2010 Parent’s Weekend, I found the LA Public Transit System to be pretty good. Not too extensive but they are working on it. At least the buses are not slowed by Snow as in NYC’s Wintertime. I even took the bus to Disneyland w/ my Trojan Daughter. I might even come out again to LA when they open the Expo Line. There is also the DASH Bus. Go GREEN. GO METRO.
USC to the fashion district is less than 2 miles…on the other hand others have internships in say burbank or santa monica.
Sorry, but I have no sympathy if you are driving from USC to the fashion district. There’s like a million bus lines that go through the downtown area. And for the VAST majority of students with cars (I don’t have one) driving anywhere is a luxury. Boo-hoo if you’re spending $5 extra a week on gas. Most of you are already getting a free car and unlimited use of your parents’ Amex… I will literally scream if I see a student complaining about gas while driving to their unpaid internship in a $30,000 SUV.

Los Angeles voters will head to the polls today to vote for seven City Council seats and a range of ballot measures including whether a tax should be imposed on the sale of medical marijuana and whether an oil extraction fee should be instituted.
Although there has been minimal campaigning by advocacy groups for the ballot measures, the race for the City Council’s 8th District seat, which represents USC and its surrounding area, has intensified in the days leading up to today’s election.
Forescee Hogan-Rowles is hoping to oust incumbent City Councilman and former LAPD Police Chief Bernard Parks from the 8th District seat.
Hogan-Rowles is the current President and CEO of the Community Financial Resource Center, a leading provider of financial services for low-income families in Los Angeles.
The two candidates have sparred over various issues including whether raves should be hosted at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The issue became particularly contentious after a teenage girl died of a drug overdose at the 2010 Electric Daisy Carnival.
Parks, who serves on the board of the Coliseum Commission, maintains raves should be held at the Coliseum because they stimulate the economy of the 8th District and reflect the music preference of music listeners worldwide.
Hogan-Rowles, however, argues the dangers of raves far outweigh any economic benefits and are not conducive to the environment the 8th District should be trying to promote.
Both candidates have vowed to increase cooperation with USC and beautify the area surrounding Exposition Park.
According to Parks, his main focus, if re-elected, would be to work on balancing the city’s budget.
Hogan-Rowles, if elected, will focus on bringing more businesses to the 8th District and ensuring the 8th District receives the same benefits as wealthier districts.
One of 10 propositions and charter amendments being voted on today is Proposition M, which, if passed, would establish a $50 tax on sales of marijuana exceeding $1,000. The extra tax revenue would go to the city’s general service fund.
If passed, Measure O would attach a $1.44 tax to every barrel of oil extracted from property within Los Angeles.
Students who are registered voters in Los Angeles, including Eduardo Vargas, an undeclared freshman, were largely uninformed about today’s elections.
“I was unaware there was an election [today],” Vargas said. “I hadn’t heard or seen anything about the ballot measures being voted on.”
Aaron Mick, a sophomore majoring in architecture, said he was aware of today’s election, but has decided not to vote because the ballot measures are not relevant to him.
“I was aware there was an election [today], but I am not voting,” Mick said. “I went through the election booklet and realized there was no issue that I felt strongly about or I felt I could make an informed decision about.”

A racy e-mail that has spread virally through the Greek community and beyond is currently under investigation by the Kappa Sigma Fraternity nationals.
The e-mail, whose author claims to be a member of Kappa Sigma, asks the members of the fraternity to relate all of their sexual encounters in “Tucker Max format.” Tucker Max writes and blogs about his drunken activities and sexual exploits.
The author of the e-mail refers to women as “targets” for the entirety of the message.
“I will refer to females as ‘targets.’ They aren’t actual people like us men,” the e-mail reads. “Consequently, giving them a certain name or distinction is pointless.”
The e-mail contains a glossary of explicit terms to define males, females and descriptions of body parts. The author of the e-mail also details a way for the members of the fraternity to rate the physical attractiveness of their partners. Women are then categorized by their nationality and ethnicity in the e-mail.
“The content [of the e-mail] is contrary to everything [Kappa Sigma stands] for and we are not going to allow individuals to attempt to tarnish our name in any form or fashion,” said Mitchell Wilson, executive director of Kappa Sigma Fraternity. “We will pursue this as far as we can.”
The full text of the e-mail has been circulated to many students both Greek and non-Greek, and it has been posted on online college gossip sites.
Wilson said he received a phone call Monday from Zach Timm, president of Kappa Sigma at USC, about the e-mail.
“Obviously we are appalled that [the e-mail is] associated in any way with our name because the e-mail is disgusting and offensive,” Wilson said. “We are going to do our best to identify who the author is and hold the person accountable.”
Pat Lauer, president of USC’s Interfraternity council, and Ayushi Gummadi, president of USC’s Panhellenic council, said they were first made aware of the e-mail Thursday.
Though the e-mail purports to have been sent from a member of USC’s chapter of Kappa Sigma to the other members of the house, Lauer said IFC has yet to confirm who sent the e-mail, if the e-mail really was sent from a member of USC’s chapter of Kappa Sigma or how the e-mail was disseminated to the public.
“We have been told and understand that this e-mail was forwarded from another source outside this community, but there have been so many contradicting facts being uncovered,” Lauer said. “At this point we are going to wait for Kappa Sigma’s nationals to conduct their investigation before making any conclusive statements.”
Until Kappa Sigma nationals has finished its investigation, the university and IFC will not decide on a course of action.
Wilson said Kappa Sigma nationals has been in touch with its legal commission, which will investigate if there are ways to go through internet service providers to track the source of the original e-mail.
“Certainly the content is not reflective of our fraternity and we don’t want someone associated with our fraternity who would say such a thing. If there is such a member, he will go through our disciplinary process which could be suspension or expulsion,” Wilson said. “But what we see in some situations are individuals of other organizations or students who were trying to pull pranks put together such types of communication like this to get chapters or members of our organization in trouble.”
Ray Carlos, assistant director of USC’s Office for Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development, said he does not currently know if there will be repercussions on the university level.
“Until all of the facts are revealed, I cannot speculate on the outcome,” Carlos said.
Lauer said he is disappointed an e-mail like this would be connected to the Greek community at USC.
“The e-mail is repulsive, it’s ridiculous, it’s insulting,” Lauer said. “It’s just really sad that this e-mail doesn’t reflect the standard of any fraternity or chapter in our community. What’s more shocking is that such a respected fraternity’s name is on that e-mail.”
Gummadi said members of Greek houses should remember they are reflections not only of their chapters but of the Greek community as a whole.
“There’s obviously a freedom of speech allowance, but we also have to remind ourselves that when we pledge a fraternity or sorority we commit ourselves to holding ourselves to the highest possible standards of the community,” Gummadi said.
Gummadi said PHC hosted an event in February called “Something of Value” that focused on women fostering positive images. She said PHC will continue to host bi-weekly roundtable discussions to reinforce positive healthy behavior.
“Sexual behavior is based on individual decisions,” Gummadi said. “That said, I think one of the strongest things we can do is be good role models and lead by example. We want to set positive examples in terms of knowing that [women] should have standards, be safe and not engage in risky sexual behavior.”
Lauer said successful fraternities at USC follow a similar model of leadership.
“Younger guys in the house look up to older members who succeed socially, networking with women in positive ways, and create models that people can look up to,” Lauer said. “By creating those self-sustaining models of leadership, we can rid ourselves of [sentiments] like this.”
Lauer and Gummadi believe this incident will serve as a reminder to students about the positive and negative powers of social media.
“It just kind of serves as a lesson that we need to be diligent about what we say on private or public listservs,” Lauer said. “This is a clear reminder that we are always wearing our letters. We as Greeks are a part of something much bigger than our individual selves.”
HAHAHA!! I almost peed myself laughing.  You frat boys actually think that anyone still likes you or cares about you at all?  Newsflash: the entire female population has moved on from fratboys to indie rockers.  It happened like…um…5 years ago… Or maybe longer.  I was watching some old saved by the bell reruns and I think that they were in a frat… SO LAME!!!  I cant believe anyone actually takes this seriously.  This is just sad so I will help you out:  If you want to try to pick up more girls try ditching the khaki cargo shorts and polo with the little moose on it… Pathetic…
Speak for yourself Melissa.  Kappa Sigs are Hawt!
After reading most of this little argument, we can only conclude that George is a worthless GDI and most likely a virgin. All of the feminists of USC are overreacting with a silent protest in front of Kappa Sig. You better believe that if it was my house I would be pouring water on them from the balcony of my frat castle. This was just an email only to be seen by Kappa Sigs, but yet it managed its way out to the public. So what? Go cry about it some more. Sure I don’t support some of the things he said, but they were pretty damn funny. As for the Pikes of USC, I’m in a southern fraternity, and at my university the Pikes have a bad reputation as rapists. Good day to you all.
Bronamith = worthless
I still haven’t heard if George has a Obama “HOPE”  or Che poster over his bed in the dorms?  Maybe the answer is both?
The south is for inbreeding.
man people are going over board wit this i mean don’t blame us as a whole it’s the person who started it y don’t we get this irate with the raciest emails or the ethnicity jokes on the internet or women getting naked on the internet people need to chill and let nationals and IFC take care of this there is no need for candlelight vigil those are for the loss of people and are sacred !!!!
The political correctness in the United States is disgusting.
It is freedom of speech. If these Kappa Sig’s want to think women are objects, then let them think that and just do not talk to them.
What do you tell a women with 2 black eyes….?
WINNING!!!!
USC USC USC!!!!!!!
Fight On Trojans!! stay classy!
For a different side of the story go to jezebel dot com and search “Student Explains Frat Email’s Origins, Alleges Cover-Up.”
Ten Questions Kappa Sigma, IFC and the DT Can’t or Won’t Answer:
1)	Why was Elliot one of the Social Chairs for a house he was not a member of?
2)	How was Elliot able to mass email all members of Kappa Sig when he was not a member?
3)	How much dues did Elliot pay to Kappa Sig since he transferred to SC?
4)	Why did Elliot get kicked out of a house he was not a member of?
5)	How many “unregistered” members does Kappa Sig have?
6)	Why didn’t IFC or Kappa Sig release any proof the email came from Harvard?
7)	Why does the email mention “distinguished gentlemen of Kappa Sigma” when there is no Kappa Sigma at Harvard?  Also the email ends with “AEKDB…” same as the bottom of the Kappa Sigma Crest – AEKD(Delta)B
8)	Who is the mystery girl at SC that proofed the email for Elliot back in January?
9)	Why did Kappa Sig and Elliot ask the mystery girl not to talk with the media?
10)	How many minutes did IFC investigate the email and Elliot’s membership status at Kappa Sig before issuing their statement?
Well done.
1) no idea
2) I’m assuming that even though he wasn’t initiated into the USC chapter of kappa sigma, he was included on the list serve to receive chapter notes/relative information.
3) No idea, you’d have to see how many semester he was active.
4) PR move. Even if he wasn’t officially initiated into the fraternity, people would still complain he wasn’t kicked out because they don’t know any better. Unwinnable situation.
5) Does this really matter?
6) Considering you already seemed disinclined to believe USC’s released statements, would a picture of the originator’s email (that could easily be phonied up for the press) message satisfy you? Likely not.
7) I’m assuming it’s because Elliot was writing this message to Kappa sigma, and simply copy pasted it underneath it.
AEKDB is the public motto. I can go to their wikipedia page and see it. I can also find other fraternity’s public mottos, (hint: they are underneath the crest).
8) Caitlin Contag
9) Are you being serious with this question? Have you met with a reporter? They are trained to elicit negative responses from you with probing, biased, and leading questions. They then take these responses and make them into soundbites or quotes, which can spin a story to hell and back.
This is wrong in so many ways!   I hope they don’t cancel any parties as a result.
I read the mail, and found it hilarious.
I also think it’s stupid to attack Kappa Sigma for this email when no one knows if it was even a Kappa Sigma who wrote it.
My friends who attend USC tell me that most of their friends found the email very entertaining as well. And I think it’s pretty obvious that it’s satirical, and meant as a commentary on what the author thinks of USC frat culture.
i love how none of the “frat bros” can’t actually respond to some of the very legitimate questions posed in the comments
I believe “brolls” is the term. ;-)
There are still few substantial answers available, but one enraged USC student has gone to Jezebel with her version of events. According to the anonymous student, the email was originally written in January. Its author supposedly meant for it to be taken quite seriously and actually did receive gullet reports from his frat brothers. The student expressed her anger at the author, the Daily Trojan, and university officials for the handling of the events in three main points.
1. the email is real, NOT SATIRE/A JOKE, and 100% originated from USC’s Kappa Sig. I even heard the author actually received “gullet reports.”
2. The author has been expelled from the frat – but only now that this has come to light. The original email was sent in January.
3. IFC, Kappa Sig, and the Daily Trojan are obfuscating the facts to try and put the blame outside USC and save the image of the Greek system/the university.
It’s really sad how you people try to post with my name especially when its the exact opposite of what I say. The even more moronic thing is YOU JUST POSTED THIS ON THE OTHER ARTICLE. And no, frat boy, I don’t need to apologize for blaming the flawed and dehumanizing Greek system. Especially when people like you give credence to it.
The letter’s author is clearly not right in the head. The author is likely high on pornography.
This email was written by someone at Harvard. This was the irrefutable evidence that exonerated that guy from KSig. USC would not dare to falsify information. You honestly believe they would lie to the entire student body? Why would they? They have a lot more to lose, than a single individual. I think everyone owes Kappa Sigma and the alleged author an apology.
Bro, you posted this on the other site. If you want to try to look like me, you’re going to have to do better than that. And if it’s Harvard, provide us a link. Where is this “irrefutable evidence” you keep bringing up?
And it’s not USC, it’s the IFC generating this “report.” So, as by your name on the other board, “know the facts” first.
Are we even sure it was someone from Kappa Sig? I could’ve been someone who hates frats and wants to defame them as much as a brother.
Some of the comments being posted here would be amusing if they weren’t so offensively infantile.  The sexist remarks on the one hand, and the anti-fraternity hysteria on the other leave most of you looking like prejudiced morons. An embarassing day to be a Trojan alum indeed…
So, since you’re a big alum now, why don’t you be mature and stop attacking *everyone*? Maybe generate an original thought.
“‘Younger guys in the house look up to older members who succeed socially, networking with women in positive ways, and create models that people can look up to,’ Lauer said.”
Networking with women in positive ways? Networking? HAHAHAHA, wow. I’m totally and utterly ashamed! For all these years I assumed that frat parties were events at which frat guys cultivate an environment which makes it easy for them to stick their dicks in girls. I can’t believe they were actually networking with women in positive ways the whole time! Imagine my embarrassment!
Thanks, Pat. Thanks for dispelling all of my false notions of what fraternity men do with women. Your powerfully persuasive denial of reality is a testament to the type of quality education we all, frat stars and the un-fratty alike, receive at our prestigious university. Go Trojans!
please people, i think the public has taken this far enough.  Whatever you say or do will not change the sentiments of college males all over the country, so just let their nationals and the university do what they will and MIND YOU OWN BUSINESS!
Thanks you.
I have heard that the student was a Kappa Sig who transfered from San Diego State.  He was likely trying to impress the USC Kappa Sigs with this e-mail… good work.   The fraternity or the USC Greek system as a whole should not be dragged down by one guy no matter what he says.
I see from some of these comments that some people learned nothing from the Duke Lacrosse Case five years ago, where after the investigation it was proved no rape actually occurred. I’ll wait for the investigation to conclude to make a judgment on this, and leave the knee jerk reactions and “candlelight vigils” to others and their not-so-hidden agendas.
I was a member of a sorority when I was in college, and the Greek system can be incredibly beneficial when it is used as intended; a place to form bonds, have a sister/brotherhood, support philanthropic organizations, and improve your campus community.  However, through the years and through bad individuals, so many Greek Organizations have veered off those original goals and this is incredibly sad.  I do think the fraternity as a whole should be punished, they didn’t take any action against the individual when the email was circulating just around their house; in fact I bet there was a lot of back-slapping and a even contributions to the reference “gullet report”.  That is complicity, plain and simple.  It is only when their brother’s email became public that their president is willing to discuss reprimanding the individual.  
The idea that this may be a joke or satire is completely irrelevant as it addresses an issue that the Greek community deals with on a regular basis; the subjugation of women as conquest.  I am sure this is not the first or last fraternity house to issue such a missive, but it is public which opens the door for public discourse on the matter.  
I have known wonderful Greek organizations whose sisters & brothers do strive to uphold themselves to a higher standard of behavior and community service, and I have known Greek Organizations that do just the opposite.  It’s time for the University system in tandem with the Greek system to look at how they truly act, and weed out the bad ones.
Now that USC and IFC have finished their investigation and nothing wrong happened, it is time for George and all the other Greek Haters to apologize!  Same for the DT who perpetuated the lie.  You should all be ashamed!
I’m Waiting George!
I find this very amusing. I call for a Candle light bullsh*t on all the jokes/humor sites with blond jokes, yo mama jokes, little suzie jokes.
Yes, we should not judge the character of an entire fraternity based on the actions of one brother. Yet it seems to me that fraternities are brotherhoods of like-minded men, who are chosen (bids are given out selectively) based on similarities. And let’s face it, social fraternities are based on social interactions — which include partying, having sex, and forming friendships with people who you see commonalities with. So for me, I see this e-mail as something that reflects on the entire house, whether they want to dismiss it as an isolated incident stemming from a single individual that they would rather not associate themselves with publicly (though they probably encourage this sort of dialogue privately)… had this particular brother truly believed that this e-mail would not be well-received by his fraternity brothers, he most likely would not have sent it. But I really do believe that for this brother to have sent out such an e-mail, there had to be a certain level of confidence that it would have been not only well-received but thought to be hilarious (as this is typical of Greek life humor — just take a look at CollegeACB). Let’s not kid ourselves here.
Frat on my fellow Greek brothers. Ignore the geeds in their attempt to bring you down!
The USC cover-up is already in the works.  IFC has released a complete lie saying the email came from some phantom outside of USC.  We women need to let the white male establishment know this is won’t stand!
Hey everyone, guess what! MEN WANT TO HAVE SEX!! ZOMG! I know, it’s crazy. Deal with it. It’s pretty damn easy to spot these guys when you’re out. The fact is, women LOVE bros like this, especially when they’re drunk. If you want this culture to stop being so pervasive, stop having sex with them ladies. It’s that simple. Don’t give “bros” sex and they will change their attitude. Someone said earlier something along the lines of “MEN are the problem…stop blaming women.” Men ARE the problem… but men haven’t changed for thousands of years (at least on a hormonal level) so expecting a candle-light vigil or a class-action tort lawsuit (which will go nowhere, I assure you) to change the way men have ALWAYS sought multiple partners is insanity (as defined by Einstein: repeating the same action and expecting a different result). This guy is absolutely degrading women, but not every “frat bro” sees women this way. Spend enough time in a locker room or fraternity though, and you’re going to hear many stories that are no more respectful than this. Testosterone is a helluva drug. You say this offended you so what to sue them or dismantle their organization?? To reiterate: this is private e-mail for the members of a glorified boys’ club. You don’t like it? Then don’t read it and don’t go to the row. Live your own life, be your own person, and stop spending so much time dwelling on THEM (hypocritical, I know, since I just spent 10mins writing this). 
Happiness is a state of mind brought on by a series of thoughts, control your thoughts, don’t let others control them for you.
This is heartbreaking, but I just want to encourage you lady USC’ers to not be afraid.  Outside the walls of universities, as we all know, this sort of thing also exists.  You can find it anywhere.  But it’s often a matter of finding it.  I’m not saying that you can possibly stay completely safe from harm, but please take care of yourselves – there are precautions you can take to help protect yourselves.  We need to have healthy boundaries and be intuitive about who we spend our time with and what we do.  We need to be role models for younger generations.  We need to even be mindful of what we wear, because believe me, although we all want to be beautiful, we can do that in a tasteful way that is not leading or suggestive.  When I was a college student, I allowed myself to be way too vulnerable and was subjected to two instances of assault.  Although the actions are not something I take blame for, I could have probably avoided them by watching my alcohol intake, not modeling suggestive behavior (which I would have denied doing back then), and spending my time with people who truly respect others and themselves.  I have learned so much since then and I am happily married to an incredible man who loves me.
Now speaking of men…let’s not forget that men can be wonderful beings.  I have the pleasure of knowing literally hundreds of amazing men who have humbly served their families, their friends, and even people around the world simply out of a heart of love and a desire to give.  Statistics or individual acts or statements against women don’t mean that men are the world’s problem.  Men and women continue to be at odds, even in joking terms, like how differently they think.  But what is so often missed is that men and women are meant to complement each other.  Men have very distinct characteristics, as do women.  Just to name a few, men have an extraordinary ability to protect and lead, and women have an extraordinary ability to influence and nurture.  We need each other.  Unfortunately, many men AND women use their abilities to self-edify or manipulate rather than to love – not all, but many.  We as both genders have the freedom to act responsibly out of respect for those around us and for ourselves.  The love and understanding we show toward our counterparts (even those we may disagree with) is what can truly shed light on the simple beauty of our distinctions (and of course just to cover bases, each individual personality and skill is something to be celebrated as well).
This is more about comments I’ve read rather than the article.  Words do carry weight, and I can understand how they can cause a woman at USC to feel fear and anger.  And I can also understand the frustration it would cause for an entire fraternity to be seen by fellow students as subject to overall punishment based on one anonymous (and needless to say extremely immature) letter.  I pray that this gets resolved justly and that these conflicts between genders get put to rest.  (= \
you seem like a beautiful person
The only problem here is that the email is full of lies, no one in Kappa Sig ever gets laid
The response by Mitchell is classic CYA. They know that Elliott Peter Hamilton wrote the email. They’re just doing damage control so that their frat’s good name (HAH) isn’t tarnished. The only reason they kicked him out is because other people found out. Way to go, Mitchell Wilson!
I find it interesting that you are all so focused on being politically correct.  It’s an unverified E-mail that doesn’t involve you!  Your freedom of speech has given you the option to distribute and read such E-mails, so laugh and go on to the next fun thing in life.  Here in China, we face imprisonment for mentioning things that “disrupt social harmony.”  E-mail, phone calls, and even SMS messages are monitored closely.  I’ve had friends of friends locked up because their phone conversations indicated a hint of anti-government sentiment.
Sheesh, I thought getting on USC’s news website would provide more insightful, meaningful content and discussion.
Just because someone says something doesn’t make it right. If someone yelled a racist comment at you, would you applaud their free speech or condemn them? Not that hard to figure it out. Your problem is you can’t seem to empathize.
The lesbian population of USC thanks Kappa Sig for sending a few more converts our way.
I’m not worried.  They will be back with new skills that might come in handy.
I hope their next chapter meeting has guest speakers: Their moms, sisters, and grandmas. I’d love to see this “pie-getter” stand and read this letter to his dear mother…and have the other bros boldly defend the letter to the faces of the women they likely love and respect. There’s no need for sanctions against the house, though I hope their national organization sees how desperately this chapter needs a culture change and addresses it internally. That said, not all fraternities are this misogynistic [If the author felt this letter would be well-received, it’s likely he’s not the only person in the chapter to find this line of thinking entertaining, though I’m sure there are bros who experienced a conscience-twinge or four.] 
I hope I’m raising my son well enough to not grow up to spend his college years representing himself – or our family — this way, and I hope I’m raising my daughter with enough self-respect that she’ll choose not to spend her time with people who view her as little more than a “gullet” and “pie.” During my years as a little sis to a fraternity (and also what the author refers to as a “sorostitute”), the bros were truly like brothers. I’m always sad when things like this happen, because it feeds the stereotype of fraternity members as narcissistic, woman-hating troglodytes. Life is not always so black-and-white, and condemning all Greeks isn’t helpful. 
I’m a mom now, and if the author were my son, he’d be pulled out of school and living at home to volunteer with women’s organizations for the next year — though not allowed to troll for dates there — or five…long enough to understand the humanity of women. He may be a legal adult, but he is clearly far from being a “man.” Also, since he specifically testified to need a penicillin shot or two (thanks to some unsafe sex practices with “over 50 pieces of pie”), that poor child needs a little remedial sex ed. That future “7” of a wife he hopes to not eff things up with isn’t likely seeking a fiance with herpes and love letters like this in his past. [Also, FYI, “non-consent” and rape ARE the same thing. He’s got a few years worth of workshops to attend, if National can figure out how to deal with this matter internally.]
P.S. How is it that digital natives have yet to master the concept that you don’t e-mail people things and assume that *telling* them not to forward them means they won’t?
Can we call you a MILF?
Do you date younger men?
Yo doe, y’allready know what it izzzzzzz. Is da pussy dere? if it be, lay in dat doe. You don’t know. Y’all don’t know. Ride till we die. 143. flirtatious and shit. Up out da club doe. Late night. Regrettable situation. peace.

If this really shocks anyone then you have never been to a frat party/ met a fraternity member. I was always confused why the university allows them to exist, since they offer absolutely nothing positive, and are gross PR nightmare for the school.
The email crosses the line.  The email mentions non-concent and rape are not the same thing. This is legally and morally incorrect.   It also promotes the notion that sexual diseases can be treated by penicillin.  Irresponsible as HIV is neither treated nor cured by antibiotics.  Women in a state of drunkenness encouraged by the email cannot consent either.  The racism is indefensible by any standard of humour.  Most disturbing and perhaps telling is the reference to women as “its’.  This level of misogyny displays a deep seated contempt for women and a massive self esteem issue.  It is the language used by sociopaths.  At best the author is a sexually unappealing narcissist with a poor sense of judgement and a nasty cruel side at worst someone the school should identify and require a professional assessment of before returning the student to the university environment.   The desire would not be to shame the person (they are full of shame always) but to perhaps use the experience to lessen the impulse to create and think such unhealthy thoughts, and to make amends so that the writer might perhaps one day enjoy a healthy relationship with another person.
Satire has context.  You could defend it as a parody in the Tucker Max vein.  But it’s still not a defence.   In a New York Times review of an Orson Wells production with an African American lead the headline read “Citizen Coon”. This was broadly acceptable in its day and now is not.   This type of “wit’ at the expense of others is now horrifying. This shows an improvement over a much more brutal time.  (domestic violence and drunk driving were great gags and shrugged off behaviour as of course was many forms of rape). The email can’t be defended as an attempt at humour because the subjects it treats are longer funny.  They were never funny to women and now men have joined women and shared their revulsion.
You know what’s appalling to me?  How few people recognize that this is satire.  It was published in the Daily Trojan as an unspeakable act of misogyny, which in turn caused the story to be picked up by various internet rags, Jezebel chief among them.  There is an investigation going on, the school and the fraternity have received tons of negative publicity, all because of an e-mail that is ITSELF AN INTENTIONAL COMMENTARY ON MISOGYNY ON THE ROW.  Are you guys seriously this thick?  You are lending credence and media attention to a non-story.  I don’t care if it’s not funny satire.  I don’t care if it goes too far.  It’s satire.  Which means that it is absolutely pointless to get up in arms about it.
And since I know I will be labeled as a bro mindlessly defending my bros, I should point out that I hate the row and haven’t set foot on it in a year and a half.
If I understand you correctly, you’re saying that the bro who wrote the email so detests the culture of misogyny rampant on the Row that he spent what was likely several hours writing that “manifesto” solely in an attempt to help dismantle the patriarchy?
Thanks for giving me my first big laugh of the day! Oh man, I seriously just guffawed.
It indeed *is* so truly appalling how few people recognize satire, which is clearly far more appalling than the hateful, degrading, misogynist content of the email. Oh, the oppression you rich, white, straight, cisgendered, able-bodied, privileged frat bros must endure! Here, I bought this teeny tiny violin just for you.
Ugh, you fall under the category of high school students who are trying to use big literary words. You know, those people who don’t know what satire is or always say “I’m speaking ironically.”
As a USC alumnus (from both the College and Gould) I’m very embarrassed about this whole situation. Now most of you may assume that I am referring to the email, but I’m more disgusted with the way that people have reacted to it. Yes it’s absolutely horrible; yes whoever wrote it is a misogynistic pig; and yes it is racist and degrading to women. The truth however, is that we are publicly crucifying an entire organization based on what someone forwarded on a frat listserve. Those things are basically the equivalent of a bathroom stall wall at a Route 66 truckstop. 
I doubt any frat guy has the attention span to write something that elaborate. As someone who was in a fraternity at a time when email was beginning to become prevalent, I saw worse things being forwarded around. It’s the Internet for the love of god. It doesn’t help that behavior like this is glorified by websites like Ask Men and individuals like Tucker Max. It’s horrible, yes, but are people seriously having a candle light vigil in front of the fraternity house because some bro decided to send an email? There are women being stoned to death in the Middle East. Let’s have a candle light vigil at the nearest Mosque. While we are at it let’s protest the German department for teaching a language that was used to disseminate hatred that led to the slaughter of an entire people. We don’t even know how the fraternity reacted to it. For all we know, there probably aren’t any Gullet Reports out there. So much of this public harassment is being based on extremely dubious grounds. Give the guys a break, you’re only promoting stereotypes and making yourselves look like hotheaded radicals by taking such an absurd stance. Unless you act with proof you’re no better than they are.
Here’s some proof, genius: this comment board. So before you get all up in arms about us condemning not only the content, but also the support, read a little more and stop extrapolating.
If I were a student, parent or alumn I wouldn’t be happy with an impotent symposium on women’s rights. I’d ask USC to hold an assembly for the student body and make the author stand up and read his email out loud  and FACE HIS PUBLIC LIKE A MAN.
I honestly found the whole e-mail hilarious, whether it’s a serious e-mail or a total troll. Yes, it’s sort of…disgusting, but that doesn’t mean every frat (and every MAN) is like that. Although, the guy who wrote this is gonna have a real hard time getting any “pie” after being caught.
as offending as the email is I hate to say it but women do this to themselves
i hope the author of the email gets sued though that would be pretty funny
> “as offending as the email is I hate to say it but women do this to themselves”
You’ve got to be kidding me.  This victim-blaming attitude is precisely what forms and strengthens the rape culture we live in.  No one EVER asks to be raped, just as no one EVER asks to be so antagonistically degraded in the way the author of this email has so degraded women.  If you think women have brought this upon themselves, you are in desperate need of a cultural education.  How are women to blame for this immature, misogynist email?  How do you possibly reason that one?
We will be silently protesting in front of Kappa Sig tonight at 8pm.  We are meeting at 28th and University at 7:45pm.  Please try to bring your own candle.  Serious like minded men including fraternity members are welcome to join us.
I’ll be there to throw stuff at you from my balcony. See you there.
That will just speed your ultimate demise as a University recognized organization
It just guys talking about what kinda of pie they like relax!!!!!!!!
Great news!  We will have media coverage from several local television stations and the LA Times.  If you can’t make it tonight, be sure and watch the late night news broadcasts to see our efforts against these misogynist pigs!
is there an official FB event for this?
I just searched the LA Times website this morning. No mention of any kind for this vigil.
Wait just a minute. Hold the comment presses. A candle light vigil? Does anyone out here think this is completely over the top? If anything, you are giving more credence to the content of the “inflammatory email.” If there ever was a prototypical example of the age old saying about not dignifying something with a response, this is it. What exactly are you accomplishing with a vigil? 
By trying to exploit media coverage using a vigil- something that should be reserved for remembrances- I say you are worse than the bros. If a bunch of bros get together and want to entertain each other through electronic mail, who are you to pass judgement on the content.  
I say we hold a vigil for the loss of the dignity and value of vigils brought on by this inane and futile exercise of supposed moral outrage… the true tragedy here.
One last point to all the people who are so eager to jump on any train aimed at bringing down the bro-establishment. To bros, the bromail is like keeping a journal. A such, it is critical for the bro as an outlet. A place where he can vent, laugh and perfect their skills of email forwarding. People forward me stupid racist emails about Obama. But guess what, I love Obama and voted him in office. 
An email forwarded to Kappa Sig members speaks NOTHING about the character of the men in that house. You vigil-antes are trying to ruin a safe outlet for the bros. Shame on you. In fact, I have never been more ashamed to be an alum in all the 9 months or so of being on.
I agree with you completely, Ben. A candlelight vigil is so ridiculously over the top and I feel embarrassed for the people that actually participated. Candlelight vigils are held for the purpose of remembering a person/people who have died or to support people who are in critical condition (e.g. the vigil held by Sig Nu for Jackson Roddy). While I agree that the email was disturbing, we don’t know the context of it… whether it was just a joke among the brothers or if someone in Kappa Sig even wrote it. Regardless, even if a brother did write it in complete seriousness, the bigoted views of one brother does not reflect on the others, and Kappa Sig shouldn’t be derided like this for something that one person wrote. As for the whole media coverage thing, I think the people that see/hear about this will be more entertained by over-the-top, unnecessary activism than be inspired by a vigil over a freaking email.
Your clueless, entitled opinions make me sick. How does receiving racist emails contribute to making you a better person, exactly? I’m sure it helps your black brothers to feel right at home too. Guess what, spreading emails that dehumanize women and promote sexual assault is NOT harmless. It contributes to create an environment where females don’t feel safe, and rape goes unreported. I’m sure the poor mother who paid to send this hateful male slut through college is ashamed to have delivered her through her *pie*. Gosh.
Also, “a place where HE can vent […] and perfect THEIR skills”??? Someone needs to work on his “forwarding” skills, to same nothing of his critical thinking and human decency skills. Grow up already.
“…ashamed to have delivered HER through her *pie*.”
(This should say HIM — then again, gender inequality is the problem, isn’t it?)
“…to SAME nothing of his critical thinking…”
(I would tell you that this is a common mistake, but it’s not.)
By the way, after reading through this comment thread, I feel compelled to point out the fact that George is quick to denounce people for commenting anonymously, while remaining anonymous himself. Way to get out there and take a stand, person-with-one-of-the-most-common-first-names-in-the-country.
You obviously don’t get my point, so I’ll spell it out for you: would you say any of this garbage in front of a woman, especially one that you care about? Would you be so quick to defend it then?
Nope. I want everyone I know to hear absolutely everything I’ve ever said, ever, ever.
As if you had anything constructive or relevant to say.
As if that’s not a sentence fragment.
Well, I’m just glad you can be “compelled” to point out the irrelevant. Must be a fun way to spend your time. Or, you know, you could actually say something about the disgusting issue.
you should never feel safe anywhere at any time anyway sister. all men are looking to rape all woman at all times. Give me money for my political campaign and I will make the scary things go away!
I think a candlelight vigil is completely justified. It’s a show of solidarity against an institution that has been shown repeatedly to be racist, sexist and homophobic. Hopefully we can get the current administration to pull their already limited political support of the row in the future.
bet you’re a fat virgin who didn’t get accepted into Kappa Sig
Another “broll,” but then again who is surprised? When it comes to defending stupid things, you guys sure take the cake!
Tommy’s twizzler is so tight after enjoying this.  My alma mater always makes me proud.
As a female USC alum, all I can say is that this email appalls and disgusts me on so many levels. I am planning on writing a letter to the university today stating that, if no action against Kappa Sig is taken, I will never give money to the school again.
It’s a shame this disgusting incident is painting the Greek system at USC in a poor light. I was not a member of a sorority out of personal choice and preference, but many of my friends were in sororities themselves — and my own boyfriend was a member of a fraternity all throughout his time at USC and many of my male friends came from the same house. These individuals were never sexist or promoted such heinous acts against women; actually, I was accepted amongst my boyfriend’s frat brothers and was treated as a social and intellectual equal when I visited the house.
It upsets me to know that many of USC’s frat members are promoting misogyny like this and it’s even more of a shame the school does little to prevent this. Having a “seminar” on how to treat women doesn’t change inherent social standards many houses preach. Not all houses are terrible — but there are a few known bad eggs around and USC seems to turn a blind eye to the “problem” houses. 
Kappa Sig was always a known problem house, and I recall several other houses being under investigation for date rape during my tenure as a student. The “punishments” USC gave these houses were laughable, and many cases of rape and drugging were dropped by the school. What kind of message does this send to female USC students? I’ll tell you — USC doesn’t care about the safety of female students from predators on the Row. Period.
Today is a really, really sad day to be a Trojan.
Oh and PS, frat trolls: I’m neither fat nor ugly nor beat. I think I got laid in college more than half of the pledge idiots who are posting offensive comments here combined.
Thanks for the clarification that it was your “own boyfriend,” not some other boyfriend, who was a member of a fraternity.
Wow such perspective after graduating a year ago.   I’m not surprised you banged lots of guys
Liz,
To ask for sanctions against an entire fraternity is unfair and entirely ridiculous. The author of the email was stupid, but likely thought he was being funny. Offensive or not, (as locker room talk tends to be) this doesn’t rise to anything close to applying sanctions to entirely innocent members of any frat. 
Your lumping this frat in with frats that have actually been under investigation for rape is what is truly disgusting!  How dare you pile on, inferring this house is a problem house.  As for punishments for this house, are you kidding, for an offensive email that may or may not have even come from a member of the frat?  Only the author should be reprimanded and banished from any affiliation with this fraternity, IF he in fact is even a member.
I would like to see your outrage when the liberal left brought in Finkelstein, the “holocaust-denier”, yet this man was paid to speak at SC. 
This email issue and blaming an entire frat for one boys stupidity is absolutely ridiculous.
Totally disagree. The email is indicative of a large element of frat culture at SC. 
Also, if you call Finkelstein a “holocaust denier” you have little knowledge of his work, and your insinuation of holocaust-denial as a solely leftist cause or talking point is…bizarre, really.
To USC alum10
You have lost any ability to apply logic to this silly situation.  Your comment, that it is a “sad day to be a Trojan”, lacks critical thinking.  I mean, are you kidding? One dumb kid writes an offensive email and the entire trojan student body is put in a bad light? You are crazy! And you do more of a disservice to women by bragging about how often you got laid. Wow, like that doesn’t speak volumes about you.  So you are proud to be a tramp, but you don’t want guys to think of women in that way, hmmmm, ….crazy is as crazy does. 
 Your comment that USC doesn’t care about the safety of female students from “predators”on the Row. What say you? What proof,… oh yeah, cuz you said so. Maybe you are the predator, since you appear to be so proud of getting laid more than half of the pledges.  Crazy is as crazy does!
 Again, you are CRAZY!  I would be very concerned if people (after reading your comment) assume that all SC students rush to judgment and have no critical thinking skills.  But, alas, most intelligent people will understand that your opinion is only that of a loon and this shouldn’t reflect poorly on the student body any more than the the boy who wrote the distasteful email.

Nice double standard, dude. A male student claims to be some sort of pick up artist and it’s sort of ok (“locker room talk”), but a female reports on having a sex life and she’s a tramp? Wow. Don’t you have any respect for your sexual partners? Do you really believe sexual intercourse is about tricking a woman into degrading herself, something she should be ashamed of? 
Here’s the difference: being proud of an active, fulfilling sex life is fine. Bragging about tricking people you have no respect for (*pies*, *targets*) into sleeping with you is gross and sad. 
Sleeping with you must be really fulfilling, no seriously. Are you a virgin, cause you sound like one. Decent men respect women, that’s why women actually want to sleep with them instead of needing to be tricked / forced into it.
@Sc’er
So if and when it’s revealed that there’s been widespread complicity in perpetrating a cover-up among the Kappa Sigma fraternity members, would it THEN be appropriate to sanction the entire frat?
>>(And just a sidenote: you can stop acting like the frat members are just some blameless victims caught in this mess. Let us not forget who found the email so funny they felt the need to share it with outsiders. “Loose lips sink ships.”)
Also, for your own good, please stop leveling ad hominem attacks on others’ intelligence and “ability to apply logic.” It’s getting awkward for those of us who can see the not-so-subtle irony in these statements, given that they stem from an individual who willfully deludes themselves. (The fact that you somehow managed to use every logical fallacy known to mankind in a single post adds a whole ‘nutha layer of humor.)
You, my friend, are in no place to accuse the Alum–or anyone else for that matter–of being “crazy” or “lacking critical thinking,” if you truly believe that the widespread outrage over this incident is without merit. 
Stop with the “may or may not have even come from a member of the frat” shit. If you, Kappa Sig, or the IFC want people to believe that some ~*mysterious Harvard bandito*~ is responsible for the email, that’s fine. PROVE IT. We’re all waiting with baited breath for the email to be traced back to an IP address in Cambridge, Mass. 
**Since you seem to be particularly interested in seeing to it that justice is served in this case, I’ve actually taken the liberty of compiling a more extensive tl;dr list of insights & suggestions that might help get to the bottom of the matter. The addendum is provided via a reply to this post.

USC Alum ’10, you graduated no more than 9 months ago. When did you have the time to accumulate this massive amount of wealth to be able to legitimately donate to your alma mater? i doubt it was because you got a good job, probably because “getting laid in college more than half of the .. idiots … combined” lowered your grades.
wait, i get why this is a terrible, offensive letter and why frat boy and george’s lovers quarrel is straight out of the notebook, but how in the hell can’t anyone ANYONE look at this letter and see it as just a funny, stupid, entertaining message not requiring or even really deserving someone a) battling it or b) defending it?
And therein lies the problem.
By the way, “lover’s quarrel”? Is that all you got out of my points? You are lacking some serious depth on this issue.
Georgie just isn’t my type.  He must have got cut hard in the fall.  
For all your bluster Georgie, Kappa Sig would still take you as they will take anyone.
Let’s build a public pool out of your and Liz’s combined depth of thought. I’m guessing the water would always be warm.
Georgie:  I imagine you alone, fat and pimple faced hiding in your dorm room.  Do you have an Obama poster or Che flag over your bed?
haha, guess i am the only one that finds the letter, combined with your never-ending thoughts on the matter entertaining. i will gladly continue being entertained as you and your fellow intellectuals continue to comment. please don’t disappoint.
Liz:  You dating anyone?  I like your style.
liz = nimfo
Congratulations, Liz. Your denseness is down to bro level. So you’re a tombro, no?
took all night for you to come up with that, didn’t it? i’m pleased you took me up on the entertainment offer – i beg of you to continue. puns are funny, limericks would be nice too. maybe a haiku? definitely throw in a good alliteration.
Liz:
Lots of us guys want to meet you!
Georgie:
Don’t CB us here
I just laugh at how you find a “terrible, offensive” letter to be “funny and entertaining.” Daddy’s money isn’t being that well spent, I see.
Frat Boy: what’s to CB? You like “pie,” and Liz probably doesn’t respect herself enough to reject any dude that has to do with pi or any other Greek letter. A perfect match. ^ See sterilization comment first.
Liz: It’s good to know that you know how to take a side, especially with something that concerns you.
oh george. i’m sending you on a quest. one: get laid. two: get a sense of humor. 
actually no, keep being uptight and PLEASE keep talking. i’m so not ready to search for more self-righteous, unnecessarily overdramatic comments on feminism, the collegiate system, fraternity life and how you personally are so much better than everyone else. always stick with what works. also, you should get paid for this. i’ll talk to daddy, see if i can work something out.
also, where’s the alliteration george? you’re lettin’ me down.
Done and done. Do you actually have something clever to say?
The way I see it, you’re one of those who has followed your first “suggestion” like this: done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and done and … need I continue?
I pity you: I’m betting your lack of self-worth has impelled you to get involved with guys from every letter of the Greek alphabet.
It’s your life. I just present my positions to defend women from this crap – hopefully they don’t end up like you. Calling me “uptight” really is the mature way to disagree with me, of course. Since when is it considered “uptight” to have a little self-respect? Then again, you are in the minority.
since when did i say anything worth arguing? walk away george. just walk. because you are going to keep saying things, and i’m going to keep laughing for the sheer fact that i don’t care. which is what this all comes down to. i don’t care, it’s not worth caring about. get over it and move on.
you were one of those kids that had to start over if they colored outside the lines, weren’t you?
honestly, the only response you’re going to solicit from this point on is “HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA”. so if i don’t respond to anything, just assume that’s applicable and inherently my response.
The funny part of all this is you keep coming back to a page of an issue that you deem irrelevant to you. Truly sad way to spend one’s time.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Good to know you need the attention.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. okay, i’m bored. peace out george, it’s been real.
I’m in love with Liz!
Amen Liz!  Thanks for your common sense!
Yet another example of why the entire Greek system should be mandatorily sterilized. You are all stupid, hateful sociopaths.
Bitter much…
We live our live by a higher standard.  I mean I’m resourceful, creative, young, unscrupulous, highly motivated, highly skilled.  In essence what I’m saying is that society cannot afford to lose me.  I am an asset.  
I am fond of the sterilization idea though.  In fact, a test that people must pass to procreate would be beneficial to society but something tells me you would not be accepted for this either.
Something tells me your jump to judgment makes you have just as small a chance, “Sir” Bateman.
lawsuits are over the top, men being the entire problem = over the top, shutting down Greek life is over the top, all Greeks are evil = over the top. the fact is, that email is hard to defend. i don’t think the author was raised that way, I think if his mother saw that, he’d be embarrassed, And I’m sure he’s embarrassed that it’s out. sadly, there isn’t much to be done. if you feel strongly, don’t visit kappa sig or complain to the university. hope this guy grows out of those sentiments, they really are toxic. not the kind of behavior you’d want the world to see or for you to be associated with. I know
lots of Greeks who are really nice, intelligent, good people, and the person who wrote this email did more than make horrible comments about women, he’s bringing down a lot of people with him. I hope the men of this university are brave enough, man enough, to say that this type of behavior isn’t okay. no more please! makes
me sad. makes mothers sad. hopefully, it makes
some of you USC guys sad too.
We have found an attorney who represents women clients who have wronged in similar ways.  We are scheduling a meeting to discuss tonight.  We will post the location and time later today.  Obviously we don’t want to conflict with candle light vigil starting at 8pm
Unfortunately, I fear there will be no consequences, as these people lie and cover for each other, and USC lies and covers for them too. While at USC, my friends and I attended a midnight screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey which I guess an …SC frat decided to use as a hazing. The boys were rowdy, rude, and causing a scene running naked down the aisles. I complained to the theater staff (The Nuart on Santa Monica Blvd at the 405 – boycott it), and they refused to do anything about it, suggesting that I address the boys myself (Leading me to believe that Nuart was in support of this). So I did, and they told me it was a frat hazing. So I raised hell, calling an anti-hazing hotline and the school administration and emailing everyone I know. Later, their frat reps called to have a meeting with me and put on their best “We are so sowwy” faces and claimed that the frat in question (I forget which one it was) was accounted for that night. I should have raised more hell, but I took the apology, and later the idiot Daily Trojan wanted an interview with me…I ignored their emails. I should have spoken up. In another incident, a professor (The cinematography professor in the film school…can’t remember his name either) inappropriately touched me on the knee in class. He used to have a weird habit of rubbing people’s shoulders and it would freak people out but no one did anything. I called student services and they spoke with me and suggested that I talk to the professor about it privately or else “it could become a big thing” and they would have to take “serious action” if the school intervened. Again, I bought it and spoke with the professor. In retrospect it makes me so goddamn angry. Especially considering that I am still paying back my student loans for my shitty film school “education.”
you sound upset
And “truth,” you are the one embodying facetious sentiments that this university doesn’t need with regards to this issue. What are you getting out of this? Got nothing better to do?
I had a bad dinner at a good restaurant last week.  Should I write a letter and boycott?
Um…
You do not sound convincing.
you keep going “I don’t know who it was” “I SHOULD have taken action … but alas, I did not”
So HOOOOW is it USC’s fault?!
Plus, you do not present an actual argument!
IF those things actually happened to you, I’m sorry! But that in itself does not reflect badly on the school as a whole.
I mean, yes, one has to be careful as a woman. and yes, I do that and if there is a problem, I report it. But saying “I had a few bad experiences – this school sucks!” is not constructive or believable. it’s bitter.
yes, that email was disgusting.
but nobody knows who ACTUALLY wrote it and don’t take one asshole’s idiotic email as an expression of the feelings of every single frat boy.
While I don’t think the email is evidence that every man in the Greek system is an asshole who adheres to the kind of attitudes/beliefs shown in the email, I do think it is evidence that the entire Greek system has some very important flaws. Having been in a sorority and lived on the row, I can confidently say that the system is highly misogynistic.
I don’t think the answer is to find the individual responsible and punish them, although I’m not opposed to that happening too. I think that if Wilson and Kappa Sig representatives/members were really concerned about what happened (instead of being concerned about how their image is affected), they would sponsor a number of activities and teach-ins to better educate men about women’s rights. They would look for ways to change the system, to make it more women-friendly, etc.
But it’s pretty clear to me that the Greek system is rooted in ‘tradition’, which translates to ‘old values’, which translates to misogyny. People recognize it, but they don’t want to take the time and effort to change it.
Thank you Ella, wholeheartedly agree…this should start a conversation among the Greeks and the greater USC community
This is a great comment. Well said.
Yes! Thank you. Not just Wilson/Kapp Sig, but USC’s administration needs to step up and provide better resources for the organizations and academic disciplines that are doing what they can (with what they have) to address these issues.
I also want to add that all the “good” fraternity members who do not share these attitudes have a responsibility to become the rule, NOT the exception. See something, say something. Talk to your brothers.
Dana — did you actually read the email before writing this article?  “Racy?” Are you kidding me?  You write about this email like it’s a bunch of third graders giggling about boobies.  Daily Trojan needs to get a real journalism to write about this who will treat it like the serious matter it is.
It’s time to close down the entire Greek system.   This email and the posts to this article proves they are nearly all bad people and don’t deserve to exist at SC.   I would like to propose we hold a candle light vigil every night starting tonight in front of Kappa Sig where we will stand silently until they close down their racist, bigoted and misogynist organizations.  I am going to suggest we meet at 28th and University at 8pm and walk down together.   I’ll bring enough candles for 10 people.   Please try to bring your own candle and snacks.
All I can say is that I hope this is not serious. While you may disagree with the views expressed in the email, calling for the shut down of a system that 20% of usc’s undergraduates are involved in is a bit ridiculous. From that premise, it is not a significant stretch to call for the closing of USC because of this email but you don’t. 
Fraternities may not be all about “brotherhood” as they purport to be, but the bad apples of the Greek system would surely find another framework to do their bad. 
That being said, I find it interesting that nobody has called for the protection of the author’s free speech. If he had written an email for better treatment of women, and had called men non-humans, and said that all men are evil, then it is likely that this would not have been news.
I don’t know about a shutdown, but there are some deeply rooted problems in the culture that continually have gone unfixed. I don’t think Kappa Sig, or other fraternities, would have this type of problem if they would prove this isn’t their mindset. They haven’t disassociated from this letter at all except for this one guy. Action needs to be taken – word’s aren’t enough. Lauer can say what he wants, but how do we know he represents all Greeks? After seeing the facetious and pathetic comments on this website from some seriously involved bros, he obviously doesn’t. When’s the last time Greeks held a seminar or some other form of the respectful treatment of women? One would think this wouldn’t be a problem at an elite university like USC, but for some reason it has, and it is embarrassing to us all, especially if this story creeps into national news.
You say they would find other outlets, which is true. But this outlet doesn’t exactly oppose these putrid sentiments either. It’s not hard to find this out. I think the “brotherhood” mentality is exactly the problem – you do what’s in the “brotherhood’s” interests and appeal to them, which can involve this type of behavior.
With regards to your last point, duh! You seem to like free speech a lot, but just because you say something doesn’t mean it is always without consequence. Racial slurs are free speech, but they land people in hot water. Why? Because they, like this letter, won’t be tolerated. And why should anybody put up with this? Free speech is always going to be there, but so are accountability and responsibility.
Calling men evil isn’t news, you’re right. But answer me this: how many times have men been objectified and dehumanized like this in such graphic detail, especially when compared to women?
“You seem to like free speech a lot, but just because you say something doesn’t mean it is always without consequence.”
THIS. Feel free to say what you want, but seriously, cry moar if people start to rage at you because of it.
ok, so I’ve recently read the whole email, and I’ve got to say it is a LOT worse than this article makes it out to be. I encourage people who are interested to know what this is really about to read the actual email, which is easy enough to find. Also, I hope whoever wrote this gets outed asap. I think this person deserves a bit of internet retribution.
Fraternities are walking a very fine line. They confer a huge benefit to the people in them and none at all to the community at large. 
This e-mail is both a manifesto of intent and a blueprint for inflicting real and permanent damage on the women of this university and should serve as another piece of evidence that fraternities do nothing but foster and climate of privilege and contempt that makes the world worse for the rest of us. The last thing we need is to let loose another bunch racist bigoted misogynist rapists. Where are we going to put them all? There’s no room The country clubs are all full
^^
What he said.
My only question is why these issues are being raised about this content when it is in an email, as opposed to Tucker Max posting the same shit and it being called entertainment. 
Everyone who is talking about a lawsuit doesn’t understand the concept of legal standing. If he had named you explicitly, then you could Possibly file something but since that didn’t happen, this falls under Free Speech. 
Obviously this guy did a huge disservice to guys at USC who have to fight against stereotypes as it is, but I just wish that instead of giving him the attention he so clearly craves that we could all just move on and forget about it. Behind the shield of a computer screen, people say more offensive things than they would usually. (whether about misogynistic frat guys or sorority girls)
You may or may not be correct about free speech. But private institutions are a whole different animal. USC (through SJACS) has set its own conduct standards. No one’s out in the clear here.
And your last point is right on, which is why the Daily Trojan should either validate emails before posts or require they be USC ones. I’m sure the intelligence level would go up.
they say women are the problem, they say blacks are the problem, they say poor people are the problem.
MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.
who’s filling up our jails? MEN.
who’s raping our sisters? MEN.
who’s trying to control us? MEN.
we should all recognize this email as yet ANOTHER example of the rampant misogyny that is pervading our culture. to promote sexual assault is an incredibly serious offense. it ruins people’s lives forever. there is a problem.
Can’t you see that by making such wide, sweeping statements that you are being just as offensive and ill-informed as the author of the e-mail?
Men are not the problem as mush as a culture that considers this kind of thing to be entertaining 
I am not sure if you have read the email, and while it is assuredly disgusting, nowhere in it does he promote sexual assault. It would need to say much more specific and damning things than it did
He DOES promote sexual assault, explicitly when he says “Non-consent and rape are two different things. There is a fine line, so make sure not to cross it.”  If a woman does not consent to sex, YOU ARE RAPING HER.  Implicitly, he promotes sexual assault in his disgusting dehumanization of women.
Yes he Does say that, and while it is horrible and disgusting, he didn’t say anything to the tune of now go out there and have sex with non-consenting women. 
You are right that it is an awful thing to read, but I was talking more in line with a lawsuit, where this statement wouldn’t meet the threshold for the promotion of a crime. If anyone is going to sue him, it will be Kappa Sig, because they are the ones who are enduring this press and negative attention because of his actions.
All I see here is a bunch of GDIs complaining.  Sorry all of you guys got dinged back in the day.  Maybe if you weren’t a bunch of goober nerds it wouldn’t have happened.  I know living in a fraternity isn’t as nice as maybe living in Parkside, but we manage.
Sorry for partying
It’s not partying. And you’re not listening. GDI or not, there are some out there who can actually respect a woman.
I’m starting to think all these remarks are because you bros AREN’T getting any – all the posts reflect immature thoughts that wouldn’t be here if you had and fully understood a woman. You’re probably upset about not getting any. Maybe you guys hang out with each other too much, tossing around these belittling ideas, putting on the biggest act. It’s truly pathetic that these little gossip emails are your outlet. Yeah, I said it: man gossip is all this is.
And the more you and others keep injecting this attitude, the more people are going to associate your little male Greek world with the email and not with the “high standards” of Kappa Sig and the like. Do you care? Maybe not, but USC has its own system of dealing with crap like this. Free speech? Maybe, but it doesn’t mean lack of accountability. Which makes it all the more laughable that you are posting all this anonymously. You wouldn’t be bold enough to say this in public or to a woman’s face, would you? My guess is no.
So it’s not like we’re off base. People like you just provide all the more evidence. It’s not even womanizing anymore – it’s just plain creepy. That letter transcended beyond cliché sexism: it was complete dehumanization and it even became racial. Whether all these “bro” posts are from the same person or not, it sure doesn’t make a woman feel any better/safer knowing attitudes like this exist at an elite school. USC is better than that – the rest of us don’t need your ilk dragging us down. You’re not a man, and even a boy is pushing it.
If your attention span was too short to read that, here’s a summary: get a life!
Easy there Georgie.  After taking a look at this article, I think it is fair to say it is created with little factual evidence.  At best you are passing judgment onto one fraternity, and with that, the entire greek community.  Now while this email certainly isn’t the greatest, you are basing your perception off of information from gossip websites and poor journalism.  According to Pat Lauer, there appears to be no actual credible source for the email.  It could have been crafted from a club, sports team, or simply one lone individual, and then disseminated.  The only clear issue you have is how it was spread.  It was leaked fraternity email, but how many times has it been crafted to fit one form or the other.  So the best action would be to place blame on an entire community for it.  Sounds about right to me.  How would you respond if this was something that was spread and leaked by the football team?  Would you criticize them for being misogynistic?  Would you uphold them to those statements, or think it might have possibly been an email that was passed through them from someone else?
If you did read this, here’s a summary: go play in traffic!
Do me a favor and read next time. The fact that you bros post thoughts parallel to those of the letter on here, not to mention anonymously so you can have your little outlet, makes you no better. You’re not exactly disassociating yourself from its intentions – worse: you’re trolling on those who oppose them.
And now you’re blaming the journalist? When this issue has spread beyond USC? Do a little more browsing. 
The group who did it wouldn’t be as relevant if people like you weren’t going along with it and condemning everyone else (outside of your little bro world) for being disgusted. The fact you label everyone reacting against this as GDI’s sure doesn’t help now, does it? Maybe try to pull some of your buds on here back out of the hole that the frat community has gotten itself into because of this. Their facetiousness on here with regards to the situation is exactly what’s hurting your image. But, no, it must be all our fault for noticing.
Here’s an experiment for you. Think of a woman you care about, if one exists. Maybe your mom. Plug her into this little letter and see if you get anything out of it.
And one more thing: be a bit more creative.
please stop saying this email is not credible.  for all i care, it was made up.  the reason we are so outraged is because we KNOW this to be true of frat culture, but fraternities have always denied it despite the evidence being right in our own experiences at the row and on campus.  we know that frat culture forces you to treat women like absolute shit, like “targets,” like “-5’s” because they do in real life…
and we would most certainly hold the football team or anyone else for that matter to the same standard.  
what is more important–upholding your fraternities’ reputation or making sure the women you most care about do not get harmed in the ways they do…
Wow. I bet ATO is proud of your trolling. 
Just because someone isn’t a member of a Greek organization doesn’t mean they are “goober nerds.” A lot of people disagree with the inherent misogyny of the Greek system, and this email proves the women-exploiting culture of USC’s frats is alive and well.
The Daily Trojan website should verify email addresses. Situations without anonymity are kryptonite to trollin’ bros.
Georgie:  I would like to see you hook up with fellow chubster MC.  She is a man hater and you aren’t much of man.  Should work out great!
Someday, someone will invent a crayon font for people like you, I just know it.
Georgie:  Frat Boy had to run as he had a date with a Hottie.  I’ll be taking things over from here.   What is this about you being heavy and lonely?  Spill!
I am a woman and I support every sentiment you have made on this site. After reading that e-mail, it is comforting to know that there are rational and intelligent men making poignant arguments for equality of treatment.
All of these posts are from members of Pike just trying to get kappa sig kicked off the row so they can take their house.
Not going to happen, Pike. Sorry. You will remain house-less forever.
Can someone please explain how this is lawsuit worthy? Does Kappa Sigma National even have legal standing to go thru the ISPs to find the original source of this email?
As with the other girls, I am offended and I have suffered emotionally as a result of the content of the email.  I no longer feel safe at SC.   They need to pay for this!
You are so dumb. Like really dumb. Fo real. Can you please stop trying to make this a bigger deal than it is?
I hope you die. Honestly.
I am offended by your post and I am going to file a complaint against you as well
While you’re at it, go ahead and file suit against anyone whoever hurt your feelings.
It’s not. Nope.
My friends and I are contacting lawyers looking for someone to take on a class action lawsuit against the author and fraternity for this offensive email.  Does anyone know any good lawyers who would take this case on a contingency?   Maybe Gloria Allred would represent us?
I am totally offended by this email and I want to join the lawsuit.  How can we get in contact?
gloria allred would CERTAINLY represent you
I wish you the best of luck, but you have no legal standing to file anything. He didn’t name you specifically, or talk about something that he did to you, so you can’t file a lawsuit
I think so!  She would probably win too!
I think the most interesting information would come from an investigation of the Frat culture.  E.g. finding out exactly what goes on in these organizations.  I think that e-mails like this are only the tip of the iceberg.
men have to realize that women now dominate college, and we have a right and an expectation of basic human/civil liberties.  A rape culture systematically promoted by frats threatens those civil liberties.
Also, this is more evidence that women should be carrying weapons of some sort to protect themselves.  It would deter attacks, and we should not count on other people to protect us.
That email is disgusting, and just shows how much these frats aim to dehumanize women under the guise of “brotherhood” so they can score homoerotic points with each other. Get a life.
“homoerotic points”  Are you calling us fraternity guys closeted gays?  I am openly gay and I am a proud member of a fraternity and have no idea what your point is.
FYI This story has just been picked up by Jezebel, a popular feminist blog, and the actual email (which they posted) is MUCH worse than this article makes it sound!!! It will be national news in no time. This is a HUGE embarrassment for the university. I for one will not feel safe on campus unless the person who wrote this email is kicked out of school and the whole fraternity suspended. Even then, I expect those who do the work on reducing violence against women on campus to step up their game. There is a MUCH bigger problem here beyond what may look like one person’s idiocy to some.
I completely agree about not feeling safe and that the only answer is that the entire fraternity needs to be kicked off campus.  Pike needs a house on the row and I can assure you that you will feel much safer with a strong Pike than a Kappa Sig!
Jezebel, isn’t that one of the dating sites for heavy girls?  I like my meat on my plate, not on my date!
Hey I went and checked out Jezebel and it is not a dating site for heavy girls.  Sorry about that and I meant no offense.  I support the whole lesbian lifestyle and consider myself a fan of lesbians who ride Harleys.
Yes, because Pike’s reputation is MUCH less misogynistic. I’m sure most women here, too classy for Pike, of course, like when meat is NOT in a dude’s brain, like yours. Oh, and posting anonymously – I think I heard something shrivel up.
How did you get into this university? My guess is money.
You may not believe it, but I do not need the company a strong [fraternity member] to feel safe. I need fewer fraternity brothers to refer to “heavy girls” as undesirable, to make fewer assumptions about lesbian lifestyles, and to educate themselves on women’s position in society before embodying the same attitudes of a rival fraternity that they try to criticize. Maybe then I’ll feel a little safer.
The front page of the website is lesbian bikers.  Are you trying to say Jezebel is not a lesbian web page?
Hey I’m sorry about the heavy girl comment.  I hope that did not hit too close to home.
Thank you for proving my point. And it doesn’t matter how much I weigh: you insult a heavy woman, you insult all women. It’s that simple. 
To university officials, I hope you’re reading this exchange. This demonstrates that the problem is WAY deeper than one fraternity. Even those who have chosen to represent themselves publicly do not have the decency to express an ounce of respect for women. USC as an institution fosters this kind of environment when it does not act, confronted with such blatant misogyny in its name. You have a responsibility to the women on campus (that’s more than half of the undergraduate population!) to follow through with punitive measures against the fraternity responsible for this email AND to increase funding for campus programs and academic disciplines that address women’s inequality!
MC:  I’m sorry if you can’t keep control of your weight.  I workout nearly everyday and I don’t eat fast food or drink soda.  I take care of my body because I respect myself and my body is a gift from God.   Maybe you should come down to the Lyon center for a few hours and see if a little exercise makes you feel better about yourself.
1) thanks for writing your honest thoughts, Pike.  it really does reaffirm that the misogyny and hatred we see in the email is not simply the one asshole who happens to be in kappa sig, but rather a deep (and deeply disturbing) part of frat culture.  
2) has every person you have ever cared about and felt any ounce of respect and empathy for always been a man?  do you not have either a mother, a grandmother, a sister, a female lover, a female close friend, or any woman upon whom you wouldn’t want to cause harm?  have you ever, ever tried to imagine the pain she feels from not feeling skinny enough, from not feeling sexy enough, from feeling too sexy, from being sexually harrassed daily, from being abused and/or raped, from constantly fearing abuse and/or rape, from not being respected in all aspects of life relative to men… 
what do you gain from having these attitudes? and at whose expense…?
Where’s the like button?
This makes me smile because a pike clearly wrote it.
To everyone else who feels that these comments reinforce the email– get a life. If you can’t take a joke, you deserve to be upset.
Because fat girls don’t deserve respect, they are gross and unf*ckable and therefore their opinion is worthless. Is that the joke? Haha?… I am not fat, and I am offended.
You know, “anonymous,” I thought people actually laughed at jokes. What kind of sick chuckle do you get out of this one?
I wanted to say all your comments have been reaffirming to read. I hope this article will spark the necessary conversation around greek culture’s stranglehold over USC student life and how it perpetuates patriarchal oppression.
You are stupid.
This article is such BS, I don’t even know where to begin.  EVERYONE knows who wrote the email and disseminated it to the rest of Kappa Sig.  The only question that remains is why the Daily Trojan has decided to cover that fact up with half truths and BS statements by Mitchell Wilson and these other douchebags who clearly care more about their image than the real issue here – the rampant misogyny that permeates the Greek culture.
Happy International Women’s Day.
Seriously. This article hardly touches on the seriousness of this issue or the depth of the how disturbing the whole thing is.
Written by a man. Not surprised.
Can someone please post the email or direct me to it on the internet?  I have yet to be offended today and this may be my best opportunity.
Has anyone yet considered a civil suit against those responsible?
A civil suit? Against whom?
The only people with half a case are the members of the Greek community, who are mostly fine people but are perennially spat on by outsiders who see stuff like this and can only see the “rampant misogyny” that mischaracterizes the whole community.
You know, with a case like this, I’d say the “outsiders” aren’t too far off. Why don’t you try to fix this image instead of just complain and blame the people whose assumptions are getting further built by cases like this?
Georgie:  Must be lonely up there all alone in the dorm room.
Yet here you are posting. What’s the matter little frat bro, did I offend your little brain?
Tried to post the link and it was taken down. It’s on Jezebel. Just check it out there.

There is nothing else to say. All you “targets” should just stfu.
And to those who say that USC is not the government and is therefore not bound to respect free speech: keep in mind the controversy from earlier in the year regarding “free speech zones,” which the university eliminated several years ago.
Well, aren’t you just a big man! Posting anonymously? Coward. USC isn’t the party here. It’s Kappa Sig. Get educated. Their standards have been broken by a coward like you who lives like it’s 1000 B.C. Please stop trying to sound intelligent. It’s an insult to the rest of us.
Maybe someday you will have a daughter, and then you’ll understand why it’s distressing to think of her being addressed as a “target”.
Let’s hope a guy like this never actually breeds.
Georgie:  Funny, I have no concern about you breeding.  Some how I doubt it will work out for you.
You know, the more you talk, the more you prove the points raised. It’s funny how childish you sound. Do you have a name, Frat Boy, or is anonymity the one time you actually want to use protection?
Still haven’t answered my question. But I didn’t think otherwise
Anyone who actually believes the sad rhetoric used in that pathetic email is in need of psychological help before they end up in prison for misjudging the “fine line” between rape and non-consent. You should seek help, if not for yourself, then on behalf of the other half of the population, who have names and are more than just ‘pies’.
You assume all people commenting against the sickening email are women. 
This isn’t about free speech, it isn’t about a law suit — it’s about this mentality about the objectification of women (in this case to the extreme). It’s clearly something many men believe is appropriate to think and feel about women. That making a decision that “non-consensual” sex isn’t rape. That a woman’s vagina should be judged as a certain kind of fruit by her racial makeup. Clearly you stand in their camp. 
This email got passed around because many men thought it was FUNNY. This isn’t about censorship, or a call for censorship — it is a call for USC administrators to take a serious look at this as something that points to a deeply troubling issue in dynamics between men when they have interactions about women. What they feel is appropriate discourse and language surrounding women, and the level to which they have taken the misogyny and objectification.
Whoever posted this email in a public format is the problem not the original author.  This email is an example of creative writing and despite the content which you may object to, it was never intended for you to read.   If girls didn’t give it up so easy here at SC, maybe this email would have never been written.   Maybe the problem here is you?
Spoken like a true Charlie Sheen follower. Delusional.
GEORGE IS MY HERO. Well done.
George is my hero too! <3  Nothing makes me hotter than a man who respects women and calls out the frat bros for being misogynist, bigoted, privileged douchebags.
oh my god you cannot be serious??!!  The problem is the women?  If someone is murdered should we conclude that they should have “put up a better fight”?  Maybe they should have carried a gun to protect themselves from potentially being murdered.  Yes, the victim is clearly the one to blame.  Great job.
Victim?  Who is the Victim here Honey?  Really!
“Frat Boy”? Nice name. I like how earlier some “bro” mentioned how frats are mislabeled as “misogynistic,” yet here these bros are multiplying and defending sexism like an ideology.
Yeah, I’m sure women are to blame for all the sexism in the world. Good point.
Sweeping generalizations time:
Maybe if the men weren’t so obsessed with getting their dicks wet, this email wouldn;t have gotten written.
Go jack off to Tucker Max, frat boy.
Frat Boy, are you for real? Men seeking sex and writing about it in the most degrading way is “creative writing”, but women having sex is denigrating to them? Why is sex fine for men, but an embarrassment for women? Why? Have you ever had sex with a woman? Did you judge your partner for it? Did you think she “gave it up” and lost her dignity, while yours remained intact? How and why? Not only is this a double standard, it makes no sense.
I’m willing to bet these bros spend more time with each other than with women. And it isn’t too hard to see they are acting like a virgin would, bitter and denouncing the rest of us just because they can’t get any. With that attitude, why should they?
And the award for Classiest Comment Of The Day goes to…
¬¬
You sound like a rapist.
Thanks Sigma Nu for making the email public!  You have done everyone a great service.
@RE anonymous
Well said. I actually don’t think the original author or any of the posters should be punished. I think this should be put into the large, growing pile of evidence that frat row is an extremely destructive institution at USC. I’m convinced that the only reason it still exists is the substantial amount of old money that would dry up if USC pulled its tacit political support of the row. Eventually, though, it will just be too much of a bad mark on a proud USC community.
This is obviously a very important matter and I hope the investigation finds exactly who was responsible and they are dealt with in a appropriate manner for daring to push the envelope of free speech and sarcasm.  Heads must roll for this sort of politically incorrect speech!   Don’t bother with those who made this private email public as they are doing us all a favor by letting us know what the Greek community is up to.
Can Pike have your house?
There is A LOT of gay sexual behavior that goes on at Kappa Sigma, from what I heard.  I knew a girl whose brother almost pledged, and he said to beware of the showers.  Seriously.  A lot of closet gays will cover up their true feelings/behavior with misogyny and machismo.
What difference does it make if Kappa Sig has a few gays?
