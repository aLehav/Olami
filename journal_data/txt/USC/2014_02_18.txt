The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Feb. 14, and Monday, Feb. 17. 
Crimes against a person
at 1:54 A.m on Feb. 16, DPS officers responded to a report of two students at 1352 29th St. involved in an altercation. After detaining the students for investigation, the officers determined the altercation was only verbal and cleared the scene when the students agreed to go to bed.
Crimes against property
at 1:21 p.m. on Feb. 15, a suspect entered the Radio Shack in University Village and stated that he would like to purchase a tablet computer. The suspect then removed the computer without paying for it when the clerk was speaking with another customer.
at 1:59 a.m. on Feb. 16, a female student reported that she had lost her cell phone and the built-in tracking device indicated it was at Alpha Tao Omega fraternity. The student saw the security guard holding the phone case but the guard denied that he had the phone. The student persisted and later the guard admitted to having the phone and returned it to her. The student did not wish to press charges.
at 3:54 p.m. on Feb. 17, a suspect entered the Radio Shack in University Village and removed a pair of headphones without paying for them.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 3:19 P.m. on Feb. 14, DPS officers reported to the Sigma Chi fraternity house where the officers cited the fraternity to Judicial Affairs for violating University policies regarding parties.
at 5:36 A.m. on Feb. 17,  a student reported that he loaned currency to a suspect who tried to sell him designer suits out of the back of a vehicle while claiming to be in a difficult financial situation.

On Tuesday night, the Southern California Business Film Festival organized the Creative Development Panel at USC, where creative individuals from the entertainment industry discussed the nature of their jobs and the creative development process.
The two guests were creative executives Christopher Ceccotti, Gidden Media and Shary Shirazi from Lucas Films.
Daniel Sussman, a lecturer at USC, moderated the panel. Sussman is also the chairman of all missions to Israel for the Los Angeles Jewish Foundation and the Valley Alliance. He teaches at the Tel Aviv University Film School each June.
The event started off with Ceccotti speaking about his life and beginning into the film industry. He graduated in 2009 with plans to attend law school, but realized the only reason he wanted to practice law was to defer reality.
“I got stuck [in Los Angeles] in a good way,” Ceccotti said. “I happened to fall in within people who were supporting me. One or two relationships would begin other relationships. I had always been interested in movies and storytelling. I didn’t really want to learn the studio part of things.”
Shirazi, however, realized her passion earlier. She went to the University of California, Los Angeles for her undergraduate degree and by her sophomore year realized she wanted to do something with film. Shirazi’s first internship was with Paramount Pictures.
“Most people go with an agency or a production company,” Shirazi said. “I was really good with development and how to develop stories. Understanding the business was something new. I reached out to my different coordinators for interviews.”
Sussman asked the panelists what they were most proud of from their work, as well as the pros and cons of the industry.
“I’m proud to be at a company that is forward thinking,” Ceccotti said of Gidden Media. “It’s a herd mentality in the industry. Whenever a writer or director is hot, everything tends to follow what the latest trend is. To be at a place where they encourage to think outside of the box is very empowering.”
Shirazi stated that Lucas Films concentrates on keeping the integrity of storytelling, rather than creating profit.
“I was proud that the company I worked for wasn’t profit-driven,” she said.
Sussman also asked about the worst aspects of their job.
“You’re going to be working with people who have been in the industry for so long, they are tired,” Shirazi said. “You’re going to be dealing with people who are having a bad day.”
Cecotti noted working in the film industry requires always being in the know.
“You have to be aware of everything that is going on in town. You need to know about all of those projects, about the jobs you might need to fill,” Ceccotti said.
Sussman also asked the panelists their specific philosophies toward succeeding in the industry.
“Don’t get out of context,” Ceccotti said. “You can be taken advantage of and be perceived of as naive. If someone asks me to do something and I don’t want to, I will tell them upfront.”
Shirazi stressed that importance of being passionate in one’s field.
“You need to believe in projects and the people you’re working with,” Shirazi said.
Sussman continued to speak about the importance of forming relationships for this business.
“In this business, this university has the advantage of connections, but you have to start the relationships,” he said.
The event was followed by a question and answer session by those in the audience.
When asked about internships, Ceccotti and Shirazi stressed that preparation is important for exploring what you like as well as for forming relationships and connections.
“There isn’t one right way to work in this industry,” Ceccotti said. “One is putting yourself out there. It’s easy to do the minimal amount because it’s mind-numbing, but doing whatever extra you can do to stand out, to interact with clients, executives, they will remember that.”
A student from the audience asked what the panelists wanted to achieve in the future.
“I want to be able to look back and see movies that made people think and feel,” Ceccotti said. “In terms of the broader corporate scheme, I don’t really care.”
“I think the most exciting aspect is working in an industry you’re passionate about,” Shirazi said. “As long as that continues to be, I’ll enjoy my job.”
Students had differing ideas about the panel, with some wishing there were more panelists.
“I liked the event,” said Yidegar Santiago Zuniga, a junior majoring in public relations. “I wish there would be more attendees, which would bring more concepts.”
Patrick Ivison, a sophomore majoring in film production, enjoyed hearing people speak from the film industry.
“I always think it’s cool hearing from the people in the industry I’m trying to get into,” said Ivison. “I like hearing about the whole spectrum and hearing their stories of getting to where they are.”
Nicole Morrison, a senior majoring in business and cinematic arts, was part of organizing this event and found the panelists’ discussion compelling.
“Daniel Sussman teaches a class for BCA,” Morrison said. “He has a ton of experience in the industry so we thought he would be a great moderator. The fact that the panelists could talk about working at a big-name company and a small company was very interesting.”

Yusef Robb, the communications director for  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, spoke on Tuesday night to students in Marks Hall about his experience in politics and how to succeed after graduation.
Communicating success · Communications Director for Mayor Garcetti, Yusef Robb, spoke to students Tuesday night about his experiences in political campaigning and how students can succeed after graduation. – Paul Jung | Daily Trojan
The lecture, entitled “From College to Career: Life as a Political Operative,” was hosted by South Area faculty master Tim Biblarz and is part of an ongoing “From College to Career” speakers series that aims to help students develop skills that will help them find employment after graduation.
Robb, who came to campus straight from the mayor’s office, opened with a humorous anecdote, mentioning that the number one question he gets asked as a spokesperson is “does he lie?”
He explained that, in tough cases such as when a seven-year-old asked what they do with dogs at the local pound, “sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to get through.”
Robb went on to clarify he has an open and honest relationship with the press.
Robb’s first piece of career advice, however, was no lie.
“Lesson number one: you don’t need to win,” Robb said.
Robb explained that the various campaigns that he has worked on and lost only made him want to be more diligent in the future.
The communications director, who has worked in both Los Angeles and New York, also stressed the importance of strategic career location, especially in politics.
“The only way I was able to have pretty good jobs in politics … is because I positioned myself in the right spots,” Robb said.
Robb also offered some undergraduate and post-graduate wisdom.
“In terms of the college experience, knowing how to write is critical … and it’s not about poetry, it’s about clarity,” said Robb, who was a journalism major at New York University.
“The career advice I’m here to give you is if you want to be in the big time, go for the big time,” said Robb, who encouraged students to pursue their dream jobs.
“Have no pride, sleep on your mother’s couch — hold out for the job you want,” Robb said.
Students gathered for many reasons, but most were interested in Robb’s extensive political experience, which includes communications work on multiple political campaigns, such as the repeal of Proposition 8.
“I came because I’m an IR major and when I saw he was in policy I thought it was something I could be interested in,” said Erika Ingram, a freshman majoring in international relations. “I try to go to the speakers that sound interesting and might be relevant to my career.”
Ben Graham, an international relations professor in the Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences, helped  coordinate the event and considered the evening a success.
“This was exceptional, we had a great turnout,” Graham said. “I love the turnout that we get at these; I think the quality has been consistently high. I love this speaker’s series.”

Esmy Jimenez is just like any other USC student. The junior environmental studies and international relations major works at Ground Zero, is a Dornsife ambassador, and is a member of the Women’s Student Assembly. No hint of a foreign accent is audible when she speaks. But there is one thing that sets her apart: Technically speaking, Jimenez is not supposed to be here.
The American Dream · Senior Alma Lemus transferred to USC from community college. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
Jimenez is one of an estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, at least three of whom currently attend USC. Though she lived in Washington state from the time she was one until she came to USC, Jimenez was born in Mexico.
“Unfortunately, my biological father was abusive and just not a good individual and so [my mother] was stuck in a really bad place,” Jimenez said. “She recognized that she wouldn’t be able to build a life for herself … so she decided to go up north [and] follow the American Dream.”
Every year, thousands of people immigrate to the United States illegally, many following this elusive American Dream. Though most come from Latin America, some, like Amy Lee, come from other regions of the world. Lee emigrated from South Korea with her grandparents when she was in the third grade. Lee’s parents, who remained in South Korea, and grandparents had a similar idea to that of Jimenez’s mother.
“They talk about that you have a better education when you come here, it’s all part of the ‘American Dream’ that they talk about,” Lee said.
That dream hasn’t always been easy for students like Jimenez, Lee and Alma Lemus, a senior majoring in political science, to live. In fact, the three Trojans had difficulty getting to USC.
Though several laws that allow students to apply for financial aid have been passed since Jimenez, Lee and Lemus entered college, when they applied they were not eligible for financial aid.
Lee, who received the half-tuition Presidential Scholarship, was only able to come to USC because of some help from her community.
“I was a really fortunate case,” Lee said. “I got to meet some great people in high school who set up a private scholarship fund for me, so they pay part of it. Without that, I would have gone to community college.”
Lemus took the community college route for both financial and personal reasons before transferring to USC.
“I did get a couple of scholarships, but it was still not enough and I wasn’t prepared to go challenge the world with my status,” Lemus said. “I felt like I was still too lost to be able to recognize and fully be able to succeed.”
Jimenez was starting to think she wouldn’t go to college at all after she didn’t receive a scholarship to New York University. But in a happy accident, Jimenez checked a box on the scholarship app that allowed other schools to see her application. Later that spring, she received a packet originally thought to be junk mail, welcoming her to the Trojan family and inviting her to interview for a full-tuition scholarship.
“My school was so, so good,” Jimenez said. “It was a small school, and they didn’t have many resources but they were really good with community. So they pulled together and paid for my ticket down here and then I was able to interview.”
Jimenez received the Trustee Scholarship and quickly decided to attend USC.
PAYING THEIR WAY
Aside from not being able to apply for financial aid, getting employment could sometimes be a struggle for these students as well. Lemus, who grew up just outside of Fresno, in the rural town of Farmersville, Calif., often worked backdoor jobs because of her undocumented status.
“I was a farm worker since the age of 14,” Lemus said. “I was working in the fields, harvesting fruit. I would have to carry a huge ladder, a huge sack. It was hard labor, especially because Central Valley gets really, really hot. It will get up to 110 degrees, and it will get really cold in winter as well, it will go to 20 degrees.”
Lemus said she often had burns on her skin from the pesticides, as well as bee stings. Despite the difficulty of the conditions, she did not always get a regular wage.
“I remember once I only made $8 working from seven in the morning to 3 p.m.,” she said. “They could pay you whatever they would like to pay you.”
Opportunities for Lemus have gotten better since June 2012 when President Barack Obama’s administration issued the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals memorandum, which allows those who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and who had not yet turned 31 by June 15, 2012, to have the chance to receive employment authorization. Though the memorandum means young, undocumented immigrants are not in danger of being deported, it does not provide a path to citizenship.
For Jimenez, the memorandum meant she could go back to work at Ground Zero Performance Café. She had worked there for six months before the fake social security number she had used for her paperwork was exposed.
“I really grew to love this place and I hated the idea that the business was going to get in trouble for any reason because of me so I pulled from it … I remember being really shaken up, they were being so helpful, and that’s when I told them about [my status],” Jimenez said. “And luckily, within the next six months the Obama administration passed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.”
“COMING OUT”
Jimenez’s managers weren’t the first to find out about her status. Since high school, she had written about the topic for sites such as the Daily Kos to bring light to how the issue was affecting individuals and share her own personal story.
“After I received such positive feedback from people, I was like I should probably keep writing about this because so often immigrants don’t have the resources to talk about it, they’re not comfortable talking about it, it’s not something that we’re told to do,” Jimenez said. “So I decided if I could have a voice with it, especially in such a privileged place like this, then I probably should.”
Jimenez also said she was inspired by Lemus, whom she heard speak about her struggles with her status at a WSA conference. Lemus said she also learned she needed to talk about the issue if she wanted to see change.
“Having to explain myself constantly made me realize that if I don’t constantly share that part [of me], how are people going to understand my situation, how are they going to be able to help me?” she said. “So that’s why I’ve learned to be vocal about it and not be afraid to ask for help when I need to ask for help.”
Hearing Lemus served as an opportunity for Jimenez to connect with other undocumented students at USC. She had been searching for a support network, and one had actually been created just a few years prior.
In the spring of 2011, Billy Vela, the director of El Centro Chicano, was in his office when he was approached by a student who was struggling with his immigration status.
“I was … having a conversation with a newly admitted undocumented student and he was talking about his frustrations about not having a place he felt he could go,” Vela said. “There didn’t seem to be a lot of different resources here on campus that seemed visible about dealing with his particular personal issue, so I spoke to him about creating a club and organization.”
From that meeting, Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success — better known as the IDEAS Movement — was born. Jimenez, Lee and Lemus have all been part of the organization at one time or another, but Lemus said the group has more allies than undocumented students.
These allies are still a minority at the school, however, since no one knows exactly how many undocumented students attend USC, and many don’t know there are actually any at all.
“This population doesn’t come out and say ‘Hey I’m here, I’m undocumented.’ It’s much more reserved,” Vela said. “Some of them are not sure quite if they can be upfront and honest in the sense of just saying ‘this is who I am’ and it won’t have any repercussions.”
Aside from the community not making itself known to other students at USC, sometimes undocumented students don’t realize that they have resources like the IDEAS movement. Vela said he believes many of these students have difficulty feeling comfortable in their own skin.
“Feeling like they can be themselves and feeling like they can say [they’re undocumented], they can talk about it, they can be who they are without fear of any sort and just feeling completely like they can be themselves here at USC,” Vela said. “I think that’s a challenge I’ve seen and heard when I’ve talked to many of these students.”
Those who have reached out to a wider community at USC have mostly done so with positive results.
“More than anything I’ve been shocked and very, very happy that people choose to become part of the network … It’s good to know people now know the honest part about you, and they still respect it, and they’re not rejecting it,” Jimenez said. “They’re embracing it instead.”
As for those who don’t react as well, Lemus said it’s all a matter of brushing it off.
“You do encounter those kind of people who try to tell you that what you’re doing is wrong, who kind of try to tell you that you’re in the wrong place and you don’t belong here,” she said. “But, for me, you just always have to move forward from it.”
CLIPPED WINGS
Despite the fact that all three girls plan on staying in the United States after graduation, all three also mentioned a desire to travel outside the country — a luxury they don’t currently have.
“One thing I’ve always wanted is actually to meet my grandparents,” Lemus said. “They live in Mexico. Because when I’m here in the United States, I don’t feel like I have a huge family … But in Mexico we have so many cousins, so many uncles and aunts.”
Lee also wishes she could go back to South Korea to see her parents and extended family. She said she last saw her dad when he came to the United States about five years ago and her mom comes to visit every other year.
“I haven’t visited South Korea since I came here,” Lee said. “I’d love to go back.”
Another college activity unavailable to undocumented students is studying abroad.
“Everybody talks about study abroad and people always ask: ‘Why don’t you apply?’” Lee said. “I’m like ‘yeah I will,’ but you just kind of say that because in the back of your mind you’re saying, ‘I’m not even going to think about it because that’s not possible.’”
DREAMING ON
Jimenez, Lee, and Lemus each had different ideas about just how “American” they were. Lemus said she is caught somewhere in the middle, a hybrid of Mexican and American that the community has come up with a term for: chicana/o.
“If I were to go to Mexico, they would call me a gringa, they would call me an American, but for me I don’t feel like I’m that American because when I’m here they tell me ‘Oh no, you’re not American, you’re from Mexico, you’re not even born here,’” Lemus said.
Jimenez, however, saw the issue in a less ambiguous light.
“I am American by default, whether or not they give that to me,” she said. “I don’t need their letter of approval in order for me to identify as American.”
Some in Congress, however, are working to let students like Jimenez take the first steps toward becoming officially “American.” The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (or, DREAM, in perhaps some wishful thinking) Act is a measure that would provide permanent residency to some immigrants. Introduced in 2001, it still has yet to be passed, and many question if it, or any other immigration reform, ever will be.
“I joke about it like ‘Oh I’ll just marry somebody,’ but I really think that’s the only way I could [become a citizen] with the current situation,” Lee said. “I guess I’m not naive about the DREAM Act being passed, and I’d rather stay realistic and not get my hopes up.”
But politics is not about to stop these three students from living their lives.
Lemus has clear plans about her future. Though she wants to take a year off after she graduates in December to participate in fellowships and internships, Lemus eventually plans on either going to graduate school to help work against human trafficking or toward immigration reform.
“I grew up in a very poor low-income family, so seeing the system, you know how it doesn’t really help everyone else,” Lemus said. “It’s really difficult for some people to get out of that cycle, that circle, so it kind of pushes me to go for social justice. I’ve been … reading a lot about human trafficking and about how the majority of the trafficked individuals are immigrants.”
Until then, though, Lemus, along with Jimenez and Lee, is just another Trojan. Lee said that despite her status, she still feels that she’s living the American Dream.
“Look at me, I’m going to USC, I’m majoring in computer engineering,” Lee said. “I have so much opportunity even as an undocumented student.”

In response to Thekatman, supporting unauthorized students is certainly not breaking any law and in my opinion is consistent with the higher principles of compassion upon which all world religions are based. Also, to correct your inaccurate statement about the president, this administration has been responsible for more deportations than his predecessor, GW Bush. So, please, get your facts right and remember, this is a country of immigrants.
No one is illegal, in fact unless we are native americans, we all technically came illegally since it was their land first. These individuals all came here courageously and were accepted based on their merits academically, personally, and obviously brings an experience to this school like none other. We as Trojans are all about family, togetherness, and innovation. whether you like it or not, they are part of our trojan family and should be treated as such. If there was a way toward legalization, don’t you think they would have done it by now? they are brave, strong and inspiring; yet they didn’t choose that path and people need to understand that in their predicament, how else are you suppose to come out? they are not going to quit., and roll over. They continue to work hard, push forward, and continue to contribute to society. They got accepted to one of the best university in the world which means they are capable of having a positive impact to our society. People need to realize and wake up and see our  surrounding community. we can’t be ignorant and stay only within our USC bubble.
She is not just like any other student!  She is VERY brave and VERY courageous but she is also here illegally and taking the place of an equally deserving student who has not broken the law.  Calling these illegal immigrants undocumented citizens is like call drug dealers unlicensed pharmacists-it is just stupid.  It spits on my ancestors who fought to get here and the ones who died waiting-it also spits on my ancestors who were here before “America” was discovered.  We have laws that must be followed and enforced or is USC suggesting that only some laws are valid.  How does USC feel about it’s laws being followed-can the students pick and choose among those as well?
I’ve known Alma for three years and so proud of her unrelenting commitment to her education despite numerous obstacles. Thanks to the Jack Kent Cooke a Foundation she got part of her tuition covered. Now with the CA Dream Act, she has more. But her life is not like other USC students. They don’t worry about where they will live or take three jobs. They don’t have to constantly explain themselves or have to explain why they have had to take time off to save up for college. Alma is my inspiration. Thanks to a The Trojan for writing this article. I hope it’s not a single article.
These students are brave, admirable, and fully American. Even if their birth certificates, say otherwise, they were raised as Americans and obtained that American education, that they themselves obtained through hard work, determination and ambition.
Aside feom the fact she was brought here illegally, why is USC giving away money to an illegal aliens tudent? Shouldn’t that scholarship be awarded to a citizen or an immigrant with legal status. Why isnt she pursuing her legal status and citizenship the correct and lawful way, like any other immigrant who wants to become a citizen or foreigner who wants to get educated or work in this country.
There’s a process in place, folks, and if you allow this type of behavior to continue then you too are committing a crime, just as Lemus has. Why have laws if you aren’t going to enforce them? Oh wait, our president is breaking the law too, by not enforcing the law of the land he swore to uphold.

At Tuesday night’s senate meeting, USG announced candidates Andrew Menard and Rini Sampath as the winners of the 2014 student elections for student body president and vice president.

Students crowded into the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to show support for their candidates and hear the results. After the announcement, many took to the floor to congratulate the newly elected candidates.
“I’m ecstatic,” Sampath said. “This is the greatest feeling.”
Over 6,000 students voted in the election, a record high for USG. Menard and Sampath received 44 percent of the total vote, followed by Logan Heley and A.J. Pinto with 29 percent.
Menard has been involved with USG for most of his time at USC, recently serving as director of university affairs. He describes the win as a culmination of years of participation in student government.
“I loved student government in high school, and I knew when I came to ’SC that it was something I wanted to get involved in,” Menard said. “It wasn’t necessarily something I always wanted, but I’m happy I’m here. It’s been a lot of hours, days, and pretty much years, leading up to this.”
The candidates walked around the room, hugging supporters, friends and competitors. After the room had emptied out, Menard and Sampath shared their thoughts about the future and life after the hectic two-week race.
“I’m looking forward to celebrating and sleeping just a little bit,” Menard said. “But really, I’m most excited about starting our platform.”
The platform, as conceived by Menard and Sampath’s campaign team, is a means of finding balance within student government and student life at the university.
“We wanted our platform to represent as many viewpoints as possible,” Sampath said. “We picked individuals who we thought were diverse, talented and qualified to chime in on what they thought the university needed.”
Despite the importance of their platform, the candidates stress that their most pertinent obligation is connecting with students at USC.
“We’re here because of the tremendous amount of friendships we’ve made, both those we made before the campaign and those we made along the way,” Menard said. “It really is a team victory, and we’re so thankful for the people we have in our lives that helped us get here.”

USC unveiled a new statue honoring legendary baseball coach Rod Dedeaux on Sunday, a day before the 11-time national champion would have turned 100 years old.
Winning tradition · Rod Dedeaux amassed 1,342 wins and a record 11 national titles as the head coach of the USC baseball team from 1942 to 1986. USC unveiled a statue honoring Dedeaux before Sunday’s game. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
Dedeaux, a USC alumnus, collected 1,342 victories in over four decades at the helm of the program, turning it into arguably the most successful in collegiate baseball history. The former Major League baseball player and successful trucking magnate retired from coaching in 1986 and passed away at the age of 91 in 2006.
A diverse set of speakers that included former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, USC great and five-time Cy Young Award  winner Randy Johnson, USC president C.L. Max Nikias, current USC baseball coach Dan Hubbs and athletic director Pat Haden shared their thoughts about Dedeaux’s legacy.
Hubbs began the ceremony by explaining the impact Dedeaux still has on the USC baseball program.
“I am so proud and humbled to be the head coach here because of the great men who’ve been associated with this program before me,” Hubbs said. “[This includes] the greatest Trojan of all time, Rod Dedeaux.”
The second-year coach then directed his comments to Dedeaux’s children: Justin, Terry, Denise and Michele.
“I can’t imagine what this place would be, or what college baseball would be, without your father,” Hubbs said. “I think it’s only fitting that from now on the first thing the fans will see when they walk through those gates is Coach Dedeaux welcoming them to Dedeaux Field.”
Nikias was appreciative of Dedeaux’s impact on not just the USC baseball program, but also the university as a whole.
“In the 134-year history of our university, very few people have had such a long and lasting impact on the University of Southern California community,” Nikias said. “Rod Dedeaux inspired our baseball players and enriched our campus spirit for more than half of the university’s history.”
Johnson, who played for Dedeaux between 1983 and 1985 before embarking on a 22-year Major League career, reflected on the coach’s relationship with his players and other USC students.
“Rod meant a lot of different things to a lot of different people,” Johnson said. “Not even just baseball players … the lives he touched [included] the student-athletes who went on to become successful businesspeople, successful baseball players.”
Johnson was adamant in his belief that Dedeaux touched lives outside of the USC baseball program.
“I truly believe this day should’ve happened a long time ago, but I’m very thankful it’s happening now,” Johnson said. “Without honoring someone who had such [an] impact on so many people, you don’t want those types of people to be forgotten. For that I’m very proud to be a Trojan.”
Lasorda, who managed the Los Angeles Dodgers to World Series titles in 1981 and 1988, was a close personal friend of Dedeaux’s. Lasorda recalled touching personal anecdotes about the former coach.
“It’s tough for me to come up here and talk about a man that I loved very dearly,” Lasorda said. “I held his hand the day before he passed on. For 40-some years I walked through the doors of the [Los Angeles Memorial] Coliseum with him, and I haven’t been back since. I said I’ll never go in there again without him.”
Though the two were only separated in age by 13 years, Lasorda spoke of Dedeaux as a father figure.
“I cannot talk about what he’s meant to me, what he’s meant to baseball, what he’s meant to the University of Southern California,” Lasorda said. “He will always be the greatest in my mind. I’ll never meet another like him, and I know God will never create another like him.”
Even after all of these speeches, perhaps it was Haden who was the most succinct in his praise of Dedeaux.
“The very first name, the unanimous pick, the greatest coach in USC history was Rod Dedeaux,” Haden said.

There’s a video clip on YouTube of former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis miked up during a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The whistle blows on the play, and Lewis trots towards 49ers fullback Moran Norris. Lewis nods his head before saying the words that would forever become associated with his persona:
“It’s a man’s game! It’s a man’s game!” The second time he says it he’s stifling a sinister chuckle, words suffused with a kind of maniacal glee that makes you think he just might have committed that double homicide back in 2000.
You see, according to legends of the sport like Raymond Anthony Lewis, Jr., football is a “man’s” game. It’s a game of physical and mental “toughness.” And the kind of raw machismo that arises from the testosterone-jacked violence on the gridiron lends itself to an equally savage lexicon.
So it should come as no surprise, then, that earlier this week a video clip of a USC coach proclaiming Tennessee signee Jalen Hurd as “soft and terrible” surfaced on YouTube. On Monday, USC Athletics apologized via Twitter for the comment and immediately deleted the offending video off its Instagram account.
There is no room in college football for that type of language — plain and simple. For all the sport prides itself on molding boys into men, what type of impression would a coach be leaving if he were to say about another player that he was “soft” and “terrible?” If coaches seek to lead by example, the coach in the video has already made a fatal mistake: he teaches his players, through his attitude, to disrespect others. This is part of a culture that engenders cases like the Jonathan Martin scandal — the kind of moral ambiguity where the gray area of “building toughness” can become black letter bullying.
The perception of an athlete as “soft” is as good as a death sentence in the eyes of the football community. The words “soft” and “terrible” serve as a type of moral judgment. What the coach in the video is effectively saying by rendering these types of judgments is that Hurd has no room to improve. And probably the most troubling aspect of those words is that they were said about an 18-year-old who’s about to begin his first semester of college.
“You’re getting paid millions of dollars or a scholarship, so just shut up and man up,” goes the counter-argument. Well here’s the thing: Jalen Hurd is not getting paid millions of dollars to cope with professional stress — he’s a college student-athlete who’s looking to improve himself and earn a degree. But this is the type of speech football players have come to expect, and it’s troubling that in the midst of this macho culture the NFL is expected to be accepting of its first openly gay player in Michael Sam.
“Modern American discourse is suffering from political correctness,” says another dissenter. But the label of “politically correct” is too often applied in situations where communicative precision is sorely needed. The sentiment of political correctness is rooted in strategic communication, the type of speech or writing that aims to elicit a particular response through manipulation.
But whatever happened to conveying our emotions and thoughts accurately? Isn’t every coach charged with the responsibility to communicate precisely? Why, then, would a coach imply through judgments like “soft” and “terrible” that a player has no room for improvement? If the coach had said, “Hurd really needs to improve his toughness and his field vision,” I wouldn’t even be writing this right now. Then again, I’d be writing about two weeks early about the NFL Combine, so thank you, unnamed USC coach, for bringing an important issue into the discussion.
The language of judgment is far too easily accepted in sports, and in this age where anyone can be recording anything at any time and the dissemination of information is near instantaneous, it’s become imperative for people to begin doing away with things they wouldn’t say in public.
Instances like these force us as a society to come to terms with our emotional shortcomings and scrutinize the way we might be affecting people with our words. It’s no longer sufficient to “spin” statements from the podium during a press conference or from a post-game interview in the locker room.
Which isn’t to say that athletes and coaches should stifle their emotions altogether — genuine emotion is an important thread which runs underneath the thread of sports. There’s nothing wrong about Herm Edwards reminding us that football teams “play to win the game,” or Jim Mora Sr. screaming “playoffs?” incredulously for an infamous rant. But for a coach of young men to make such judgmental statements about an 18-year-old high schooler is a different matter altogether.
College football coaches especially need to be more accountable for the way they communicate their thoughts and emotions. Taking accountability for one’s actions and, to a further extent, the underlying emotions that motivate action, is the measure of a man. And in case we forgot: Football is a man’s game.

The USC men’s tennis team was handed its first loss of the 2014 season on Monday, falling to Ohio State in the final round of the ITA National Team Indoor Championship in Houston.
Doing his part · USC junior Roberto Quiroz earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for his undefeated play at the ITA National Team Indoors. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The draw became progressively tougher for the No. 3 Trojans (7-1), who started the weekend’s tournament strong on Friday in the Round of 16, taking out No. 14 Tennessee to advance to the quarterfinals.
In that match, USC came out on top by a score of 4-1. The Trojans won the doubles point with impressive play on courts two and three, but the Volunteers tied it up in singles when No. 17 Hunter Reese handed No. 16  junior Yannick Hanfmann his first loss of the season. The Trojans surged back, though, with three impressive wins. Senior Michael Grant, who had been sidelined for almost a month with injury, returned to court six and took home a victory to push USC ahead 2-1.
Senior captain Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 7 in the nation, defeated Tennessee’s No. 45 Mikelis Libietis, 6-1, 6-5, to leave it up to freshman Connor Farren to clinch the match for the Trojans with a 6-4, 6-2 win on court four.
With the win, USC earned a spot against No. 6 Baylor in the quarterfinals. Once again, USC’s doubles teams got it done on courts two and three to give the Trojans an early 1-0 lead. In singles, Hanfmann got back in the winning groove with a decisive 6-2, 6-1 win over Baylor’s No. 18 Diego Galeano. Farren and junior Eric Johnson fell on courts four and five, but victories from junior Roberto Quiroz and the resurgent Grant gave USC a 4-2 win and slotted them against No. 2 UCLA in the semifinals for the second year in a row.
Against the Bruins, Hanfmann and Sarmiento were able to come out with their first win of the tournament in doubles. With another win from Johnson and sophomore Max de Vroome on court three, the Trojans won the doubles point. USC jumped to a 3-0 lead behind victories from de Vroome and Quiroz, but UCLA made it dramatic by tying it up with three straight singles wins. With the score tied at 3-3, the fate of the match was in the hands of Hanfmann, who was locked in battle with UCLA’s Marcos Giron, the No. 5 singles player in the country. Hanfmann clinched the match with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory, earning the Trojans a spot in the finals against Ohio State.
Upon reaching the finals, the Trojans had high hopes after upsetting the Bruins. But the No. 5 Buckeyes had gathered some momentum of their own after their upset of top-ranked Virginia in their semifinal match.
In the finals, USC dropped the doubles point for the first time this season. In singles play, junior Jonny Wang saw his first action of the tournament, but fell 6-3, 6-4 on court six. Hanfmann was able to stay the course and pull off a win, but the rest of the day would not go the Trojans’ way, as Sarmiento and Farren fell to hand the title to the Buckeyes by a 4-1 score.
“I think every match we played in the tournament was a challenge for us,” Sarmiento said. “These matches pushed us and we responded. As a team I thought we competed well.”
Though Ohio State might not seem like a natural rival for USC’s tennis team, the Buckeyes were a thorn in the Trojans’ side last year as well, ending the team’s quest for a fifth consecutive national championship in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.
“We want to kill them, seriously,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “After [this weekend], you just want to get back on the court and beat somebody else. Getting reps and getting answers, [just] getting comfortable out there.”
The average person might see a trip to the finals as a success, but the Trojans were frustrated over coming up short in the championship match of the ITA National Team Indoor Championships for the second year in a row.
“Obviously we didn’t like where we ended but at the end of the day we learn from it and move forward,” Sarmiento said. “There are a lot more matches to be played and we must continue to improve and play as a team.”
The weekend’s results may not have been what the Trojans hoped to see at Houston, but as far as Smith sees it, the tournament was nonetheless a learning experience.
“Speaking for myself, I’m very excited to get back out in the court,” Smith said. “The loss doesn’t sit well, but the team we lost to played their best game, and was strong.”
As far as the future is concerned, the Trojans are always working hard to be the better team the next time around.
The Trojans will head back to Marks Stadium on Feb. 21 for a doubleheader against UC Santa Barbara and UC Davis.

It was an unorthodox opening four games for USC baseball, but all things considered, the Trojans probably wouldn’t have it any other way.
Hot hitter · USC junior infielder Dante Flores has gotten off to a torrid start in 2014, collecting 6 hits and 2 RBIs over the season’s first four games. Flores hit at a .256 clip with four doubles in 24 starts last season. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The team soundly upset No. 2 Cal State Fullerton last night, putting a cap on a dramatic set of four straight wins to begin 2014.
Getting things started for USC was sophomore center fielder Timmy Robinson, who singled in the bottom of the first and later scored on a wild pitch. The Titans answered in the top of the third, when outfielder Tyler Stieb pushed across what would be Fullerton’s only run with an RBI groundout. The Trojans struck again in the bottom half of the third, jumping out to a 4-1 advantage. Junior catcher Garrett Stubbs delivered the inning’s key hit, a well-placed two run single. USC added another run in the next frame, but it was not until the fifth inning that the Trojans delivered the dagger. This time it was in the form of a towering solo home run from sophomore right fielder Vahn Bozoian.
From that point on the USC bullpen stifled any chance of a Fullerton comeback, recording six innings of shutout baseball in relief of sophomore starter Brent Wheatley. Wheatley allowed one earned run in three innings of work before being relieved by lefty Sean Adler in the fourth. Adler would go on to earn the win for USC, allowing no runs in four innings. Senior James Guillen came on in the eighth for the two-inning save to put the Titans away. The Trojans’ bullpen has only allowed two runs over 21 and 1/3 innings this season.
Bozoian was ecstatic following the upset win. “We’re on cloud nine,” Bozoian said. “It was exciting to see everything we’ve worked for come together so smoothly.”
Wheatley, who also pitched in relief  during the Trojans’ win over Northwestern on Friday, said the team was motivated by previous losses to Fullerton. “Basically, last year they beat us pretty bad, so that was in the back of our minds the whole time we were preparing,” Wheatley said. “We knew we had to come out with a lot of intensity and get the win, and we did. Tonight was the best I’ve seen our offense in a while.”
If the Trojans’ upset of the perennially-contending Titans was surprising, last weekend’s opening series against Northwestern should have served as a clue to expect the unexpected. In the course of the series Guillen collected two wins on just 1 and 1/3 innings of work. Seven true freshmen made their debuts. The Trojans played nearly the equivalent of four games, tacking on 8 extra innings, with two and six additional frames on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
They started the season with two-walk off victories and walked off the field Sunday with a sweep of the Wildcats.
“As long as we win, I’m not tired. I’ll have plenty of time to be tired tonight,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I’ll play as long as we have to as long as we come away with the win, but I’ll take a nine inning win over a 15 inning win any time.”
Southpaw Kyle Twomey started Sunday for the Trojans and though he wriggled out of early jams, it was evident that the sophomore didn’t have great command of his pitches. He would depart after surrendering three runs in the fourth inning, ending his outing with four earned runs off nine hits.
After a slow offensive day on Saturday, the Trojans, with no apparent lack of energy due to Saturday’s marathon, quickly scored runs in back-to-back-to-back innings. The loudest of those runs came from sophomore right fielder Vahn Bozoian, who pummeled a long drive to left field and elicited elated cheers from the crowd with the first Trojan home run of the season.
Then, the big inning that USC never quite managed last season arrived. The team batted around, driving in seven runs on seven hits.
“When you get on a roll, everybody wants to be a part of it,” Hubbs said. “We did a good job of staying lower, harder with our contact instead of getting the ball high in the air.”
Hubbs also attributed some of his players’ success to the long inning games. USC was able to see more of the Northwestern staff, which was not as sharp Sunday due to the extra work.
Sunday’s contest was a relatively easy victory compared to Friday and Saturday’s games, in which the Trojans eked out victories in a pair of hard-fought battles.
In a grueling 15-inning duel that tested the endurance of both teams, the Trojans finally triumphed in a 2-1 victory Saturday afternoon.
The Wildcats plated the first run of the game in the bottom of the fourth, but the Trojans quickly responded in their half of the inning as Bozoian supplied an RBI groundout to bring home Flores from third.
Despite offensive struggles, USC boasted four impressive pitching performances. Senior starter Bob Wheatley allowed only one run in six innings of work and was supported by freshman Jeff Paschke, who in his collegiate debut pitched three innings of one-hit ball. Junior Nigel Nootbaar carried the bullpen with a dominant five innings in which he struck out eight Wildcats. Guillen rounded out the afternoon with a one-inning save.
USC’s winning run was manufactured in an unglamorous but effective manner — a sacrifice fly from freshman Joe Corrigan in his collegiate debut.
“I thought the pitchers did fantastic this weekend for the most part,” Hubbs said. “I thought our defense was spectacular all weekend with the exception of one inning and then we got some clutch hits. And we got a lot of contribution form a lot of different people.”
On Friday, junior Wyatt Strahan, hurling in the range of 90 to 96 miles per hour, pitched a solid six innings, allowing two earned runs and fanning five for a no-decision. USC, however, would top the Wildcats in a 4-3 victory in 11 innings.
The game was decided in a bases-loaded situation in the eleventh with the winning run coming off the bat of Robinson. Robinson reached first on wild fielder’s choice, while the Northwestern third baseman attempted to pin the third base runner in his at home. The ball whizzed past the catcher, allowing the Trojans to secure a walk-off victory.
“I think the guys were really excited to get things going,” said freshman designated hitter Jeremy Martinez, who had a hit in each game his debut weekend and picked up a pair of RBIs. “Coming into fall, this is all we talked about: playing good baseball and bringing back the legacy that USC is known for.”
Whether it was the promise of a new season of opportunity, baseball fever or the allure of the recent addition of brews at concession stands, the Trojans’ opening weekend amassed an impressive crowd. A small sea of cardinal and gold filled the stands; fans cheered and scrambled over the plentiful foul balls that landed among the seats.
USC will stay at Dedeaux Field this weekend for a three-game series with North Dakota State.

After Valentine’s Day, life either gets better or goes back to normal — many people, like a particular Daily Trojan columnist, also outgrow their favorite pair of jeans after eating an impossible amount of chocolate. Yes, chocolate is said to be “good for you,” if it is dark chocolate — cures cancer and what not — but for the most part, I look at chocolate as a way to bury my sorrows and indulge in something sweet — because after all, food really is better than boys.
In reality, being in love with the edible is actually quite challenging because as much as I would love to practice what I preach 24/7, eating chocolate all of the time is not one of my many favorite things to do. Which brings me to my next point — what do you do with leftover chocolate? Gifting chocolate to your friends is always great, but then you’re the friend who makes people fat — nothing is wrong with some extra love, but Cabo will say otherwise. Using chocolate to prank people is always a clever idea, but that is so middle school. You could throw chocolate away, but why waste money and good quality dessert?
One solution: bake it and give it to charity or random hungry USC students.
As USC students living in downtown Los Angeles, I feel it is our responsibility to give back to the community that we use as our stomping ground. Even though Valentine’s Day has already passed, there is never a better time than now to show the love and appreciation that we feel towards our neighborhood. I know what you’re thinking and yes, I agree that this does sound pretty bold — just think about all of the people whose days you would be making, better yet, know any freshmen, leaving sweets in a dorm, office, or bringing them to class is a sure fire way to get rid of them.
Apart from doing something nice for someone else, this is a great opportunity to bond and bake with friends — on my end, not a day goes by without someone baking white chocolate chip blondies made out of leftover white chocolate Hershey kisses, or garnishing cupcakes with sweetheart candies. Though baking may be considered a very female activity to do, baking is totally acceptable for guys, too.
Buddy Valastro of TLC’s Cake Boss is one dude who really enjoys his sweets — he created wild and fabulous cake creations at his grandfather’s Carlo’s Bakery in Hoboken, N.J., which made him a television sensation. It’s a shame too bad he is no longer on TV, I enjoyed the loud Italian quarrels over which fondant was better for vanilla and chocolate cakes.
Post-Valentine’s Day is almost like New Years. After eating all of the chocolate there is another opportunity to start that diet all over again to see if Cabo is truly in your future. Willpower and a sweet tooth will challenge your path to success but as long as you have your eyes on the ultimate prize, no, not sweets, you will be good to go.
I would advocate going sugar free, but what is the point of cheating if you could just as easily purchase the real thing? Sugar-free sweets are a lie because sometimes they have even more calories to make up for the lack of “sugar” in the mix and can also be more expensive — your college wallet is begging you not to.
Valentine’s Day only comes once a year, but that does not mean that you should dwell on the bad and ugly parts about it. For me, the holiday happened and it was swell. I spent time with my friends and ate really good food — the highlight being homemade rice crispy treats which you cannot back out on, as well as some super sassy chocolate cake that had this sweet chocolate and cream cheese frosting that gave off the essence of raspberries — truly a mind-blowing experience.
For more chocolate-gifting ideas check out some of my favorite chocolate blogs  -— “Chocolate Covered Katie” and also “Your Cup of Cake” — written by two ladies that are super fit and seem to only consume sweets and chocolate. Their blogs have tons of great, simple and fun ideas that can be done with chocolate, without chocolate, instead of chocolate as well as other sweet ideas that you can enjoy.

The woman and the White Sea are one and the same. Morgan Kibby, the woman, revels in the fluidity of her stage name; it gives her both anonymity as well as an identity.
Rather than performing under her given name, Kibby chose the moniker White Sea, which comes from the etymology of her first name. On a simple level, Kibby said she’s obsessed with the ocean, so when she looked up the meaning of her name, it clicked. As she continued to write music and work on the album, the name came to embody her style.
“I tend to make music that’s very orchestral and that’s very aesthetically pleasing to the ear,” Kibby said. “I don’t really make full-on rock jams, so I think that the feeling that White Sea evokes is very accurate to the kind of music that I’m making.”
Kibby’s vocals soar and swell and the resounding instrumentation undulates like the sea she channels. The beauty is melancholy; she sings with a poignant pain.
The 30-year-old singer/songwriter is best known for her work with French rock band M83 and the helping hand she had in producing 2012’s biggest indie anthem “Midnight City.” Kibby collaborated with M83’s Anthony Gonzalez on his Saturdays = Youth as well as the hit album Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming.
While on tour with the band, Kibby realized that she wanted to create something that was her own. After teaching herself how to produce and write during her experience with Gonzalez, Kibby felt confident enough to take the next step.
“I trusted myself in a way that I felt authentic to who I was and I had kind of been in that process for the last couple of years,” Kibby said. “I think it’s natural for anybody to want to see what they can do when it’s just them in front of an instrument and that’s how it happened for me.”
Kibby started programming and composing while on tour with the band, and without any pressure of having to complete the album, she was able to develop songs that she felt were genuine.
Kibby calls her debut solo album In Cold Blood a break-up record. To be clear, she said, the title bears no relation to the creative nonfiction book by Truman Capote. It was the phrase itself that resonated with her.
“It kind of fascinates me this idea that we can sometimes in moments of crises forget how to be compassionate and empathetic,” Kibby said. “Sometimes we lose sight of being in touch with the better parts of our emotional being.”
Kibby was particularly attached to the idea that people can be completely devoid of emotion, and the phrase triggered feelings of doubt and contemplation for her that all trace back to the record’s theme.
“We all act in ways that really surprise me and made me wonder if I knew myself,” Kibby said. “To do something in cold blood is really acting without being in touch with who you are. It’s a very cold, cut-off way of behaving in the universe and even the best of us can act like that.”
In order to isolate and identify her own feelings, Kibby used mood boards to help her visualize her emotional experiences. The project enabled her to develop metaphors and phrases to explain the break-up and the feelings that stemmed from it.
“It’s hard sometimes to encapsulate these feelings in words and the mood boards were very useful for me to build a verbal palette to be able to talk about what I was feeling,” she said.
Completing the album created moments of self-reflection and questioning, Kibby said. During the post-mixing of the record, she realized that In Cold Blood is segmented into stages of grief: bargaining, depression, denial and acceptance; it’s an album that captures the feelings of letting go.
“It’s really about looking at myself in the mirror and trying to reevaluate who I was and who I wanted to be moving forward after the most significant relationship I’ve had to date,” Kibby said.
White Sea opens for the resurging electronic-rock duo Phantogram at the Palladium in Hollywood on Feb. 22. And even though she’s been located in Los Angeles for nearly 15 years, Kibby has never performed at the Palladium, let alone visited the venue. The performance marks her first show in Los Angeles as White Sea in over two years.
“What a dream,” Kibby said. “It’s a wonderful thing but also a very scary thing to try and have your first show be in front of that many people, especially opening for a band I have so much respect for.”
Performing as a solo act makes Kibby nervous. When she toured with M83, Kibby said she could throw herself into the music without feeling the burden of carrying the show. With the added pressure, Kibby has been rehearsing extensively and tuning her sound in time for her first show.
“I’m nervous, but I’m the best kind of nervous. I’m just excited more than anything,” Kibby said. “The songs are so emotional and so big that I feel like once I get on stage, it’s going to make sense, but who knows. I could have egg on my face.”

On Sunday night, the Shrine Auditorium played host to “Finger Lickin’” with Chuckie and Showtek — the first concert resulting from the partnership of music promotion giant Goldenvoice and electronic dance promoters LED (my Life Every Day). The high-energy performances, featuring five different acts with a variety of electronic dance roots, gave USC students the opportunity to experience an expertly-produced EDM show within walking distance to end the long weekend on a high note.
Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Back in November, Billboard broke news of the collaboration between San Diego-based LED and Goldenvoice, which puts on the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and operates several famed Los Angeles venues like the Fonda Theatre, Club Nokia and the Nokia Theatre under the branches of entertainment giant AEG. Ever since, EDM fans in SoCal have been figuratively drooling over the possibilities opened up by letting LED, which has successfully sold the sounds of acts such as Dada Life and Boys Noize to the California market, produce shows in some of the state’s most celebrated settings.
As a large part of the audience filled with 20-somethings was still filing in, Turkish tech-trance pioneer Ummet Ozcan kicked off the show with a wide-ranging setlist that surprisingly featured remixes of a couple mid-2000s nu metal throwbacks in Evanescence’s “Bring Me to Life” and Linkin Park’s “Numb.”
As the floor of the warehouse-like setting began to fill up, Ozcan dropped his biggest club hit to date, “Revolution,” a collaboration with Australian duo NERVO and previous USC Welcome Back Concert performer R3hab. The synth-fueled track, urging listeners to “start a revolution,” cranked up the set’s tempo as hundreds of flashing multi-colored light sticks held by dancing fans bounced along to the beat.
Scandinavian duo Pegboard Nerds (Alexander Odden and Michael Parsberg) kept the energy going, smoothly transitioning Ozcan’s final song into “Razor Sharp,” their smash house single. Other highlights included an extended mix of Krewella’s “Alive” that segued into “Get Low” by Dillon Francis and the emerging DJ Snake, a bass-heavy trap track with an Arabian-moomba drop released just last week.
The set marked the first U.S. tour date of the DJs’ three-month North American tour, and both were clearly motivated to start their rendezvous through the States with a high-energy performance. Odden, especially, was clearly feeding off the liveliness of the crowd. After a foam glowstick was lobbed at the pair from the pit, the shaggy-haired Norwegian grinned and pointed at the guilty party before dancing around with it for the team’s last few minutes on stage.
By the time Los Angeles resident TJR (TJ Rozdilsky) took over at 10:45, the soon-to-be sticky dance floor had filled up — and he turned the volume up accordingly, creating a deafening reverberation of sound that had yet to be achieved to that point. TJR teased Benny Benassi’s classic “Satisfaction” before scratching back the record and weaving into Steve Aoki’s frantic electro house track “Sooo Freakin.”
The San Diego native, who rose to prominence with his 2012 chant-along hit “Ode to Oi,” mixed several crowd-pleasers into his playlist. After turning off the massive lightboard displaying psychedelic graphics behind him in favor of thin green lasers that formed a translucent layer between the two floors, he dropped MIA’s “Paper Planes” to a loud “ooh” from an appreciative crowd. TJR then treated spectators to an infusion of DJ Snake and Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What,” which will probably be obligatorily played at every major EDM show in 2014, into Deorro’s Melbourne bounce single “Yee” before closing out with a syrupy-slow trap remix of Ginuwine’s “Pony.”
By this time, the Shrine’s setup offered two options — stay on the sweltering ground floor surrounded by flying hands and heaving chests, or retreat to the top floor for a cooler, but less intimate, experience. When Showtek took the stage at 11:30 p.m., the vast majority of the concert-goers revealed their preference for the former, with scores of females clambering onto their friends’ shoulders for a better look at the Dutch brothers (Sjoerd and Wouter Janssen).
Six bursting clouds of smoke at the forefront of the stage announced the arrival of Showtek, who immediately blasted into its electro house single “We Like to Party.” The pair went on to premiere a new song midway through the set after encouraging everyone in attendance to take out their phones and record the track.
Though it was difficult to make out the announced title of the song, it was impossible to miss its booming bass that created a grimier feel than most of the brothers’ work. When the anticipated drop came, dozens of white beach ball-sized balloons dropped from the ceiling, which beautifully illuminated different colors upon passing through the sheet of lasers skimming over the crowd.
As Showtek finished up, a robotic voice foretold the arrival of Chuckie (Clyde Narain): “Welcome to a world of dirty dance.” A countdown from 10 then preceded the headliner’s entrance, when the voice made its final statement: “Dirty f****** beats” — followed by the night’s main headliner treating the crowd to just that.
A sampling of Fatboy Slim’s “Eat Sleep Rave Repeat” gained a roar of approval as the jumping mass belted out the refrain in unison, reflecting the rise of a lifestyle and music genre that would have had difficulty filling the Shrine Auditorium 10 years ago. But on this night, Chuckie showcased the prevalence of EDM in the mainstream and its ability to synthesize other genres into club bangers, transitioning Coldplay’s “Paradise” into Zedd’s crossover hit “Stay the Night” before going directly into a trap remix of Ace Hood’s hip-hop anthem “Bugatti.”
Oftentimes, EDM concerts save  the closing set for a DJ who favors a slower tempo and utilizes less of the buildups and drops that have come to characterize the genre in order to wind the crowd down. Chuckie, however, showed no interest in easing his fans out the exits, unloading vicious drop after drop on a more than welcoming audience.
The only instance Chuckie came close to coaxing the crowd into relaxation was at the conclusion of his performance, when he asked everyone to sit down on the floor — only to bring them back up with “What Happens in Vegas,” the magnum opus of the “Dirty Dutch” genre he’s credited with developing. Apparently intent on going out with a bang, Chuckie’s signature high-pitched lead synth in “Vegas” did nothing to soothe the crowd as he departed the DJ platform.
The crowd meandered around for several minutes after the lights came up, hoping Chuckie would relent to the chants for “One more song!” and delay the recovery process from four-plus hours of non-stop energy coursing through the venue.
But there was nothing more to experience at the Shrine on this night. In its wake was countless empty water bottles, dead glowsticks and a few abandoned articles of clothing — the signs of a successful EDM partnership between Goldenvoice and LED.

Single women at USC probably hear it all the time from their parents and single older friends and family members: Find the man you want to marry in college, because if you don’t, it gets much harder to find “the one.” Now, Susan Patton is saying it as well in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. In her second controversial piece on the subject published last Friday entitled “A Little Valentine’s Day Straight Talk,” Patton boldly states to college-aged ladies everywhere: “for most of you the cornerstone of your future happiness will be the man you marry.”
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
Patton points out the tendency of the modern woman to dedicate “too much” of her time to hard aspects of professional development during her college years, but imprecisely comes to the conclusion that a husband is the key to a woman’s happiness. And though Patton’s conclusion is murky, her assertions do have some merit.
The fact that so many young professionals are turning to online matchmaking services is evidence that people aren’t finding “the one” in college. After all, what guy wants to date a girl who puts her professional happiness above her relationship? The reality is that many men do. They want caring, deep and rewarding relationships just as much as any woman would. An independent woman is a woman who makes love a choice, instead of a socially reinforced obligation.
But for many college-aged students, the reason behind not being in a relationship is simply time — time that could be used for classes, internships and networking, and time for leading or participating in on-campus groups to round out their resumé. That all-important signifier of accomplishments and experiences, in turn, gets sent to recruiters in a job market that is seeing unprecedented competitiveness.
Even a guarded feminist would agree that professional development and financial independence is more conducive to happiness than the prospect of a traditional domestic relationship. Contrary to Patton’s belief, “husband hunting” in college is not the key to a woman’s happiness. Experiencing a relationship in college, on the other hand, can act as a key to professional development — and nurturing a deep relationship with anyone of common interests and similar intellectual capability is always a key factor in long-term happiness.
A major problem facing college relationships is that its rewards are not always tangible — or marketable. Committed college relationships are often time-consuming and can be fraught with difficulty, especially when it comes to post-grad concerns such as finding a job in the same city or dealing with a long-distance relationship. But the professional importance of a deep relationship in honing interpersonal skills cannot be overstated. In a survey of finance and accounting-sector CFOs published by Accountemps, a temporary finance and accounting center employment agency, the importance of “people skills” in hiring decisions jumped from the least important factor at 1 percent in 2004, to the most important factor at 31 percent in 2009. Similarly, another Accountemps survey in July of 2013 stated that the most common reason for an employee’s failure to advance within a company was “poor interpersonal skills,” at 30 percent.
So how does a committed college relationship help develop these highly desired “people skills” within the workplace? The first, most important aspect is precise and effective interpersonal communication. By a combination of body language, eye contact and speech, people in a committed relationship can become knowledgeable of the effectual responses their words and actions can have on their partner.
Secondly, a caring relationship also deepens a person’s capacity for empathy, or “putting oneself in another’s shoes.” A strong grasp of empathy is a key indicator of emotional intelligence and is instrumental in developing interpersonal confidence. Another aspect which often goes hand in hand with empathy is the ability to compromise and overcome conflict for the sake of a common goal — being understanding and accepting of a boyfriend or girlfriend’s flaws and getting to the root of the issue is an important step to understanding how to deal with conflict at large. These concepts are transferable to the workplace, where it becomes one of the most effective tools in fostering deeper, more rewarding relationships with one’s co-workers — and avoiding conflict altogether.
To suggest that a young woman in college ought to be “husband hunting” because a man is “the cornerstone of [a woman’s] future happiness,” as Patton does, is patently absurd.
College is a time to grow and deepen one’s understanding of interpersonal dynamics. Women should not be wary of entering into a committed relationship for fear of losing their chance at future independence. If anything, the right partner can provide a deep, one-of-a-kind support for a woman’s professional goals. But it’s in understanding an appropriate balance — or compromise — that can make the two areas more rewarding in their own way.

A well-written piece. Talking about ex-girlfriends as an example of interpersonal dynamics  in an interview would certainly make those “Tell me about a time…” questions more entertaining.

As the nation continues to mark the achievements and contributions of African Americans in the celebration of Black History Month, the historically black colleges and universities that educated and fostered many legendary African Americans, such as civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, are struggling to maintain their financial stability. Since 2009, nine HBCUs have lost their accreditation or been put on probation for not meeting educational standards, according to a Ford Foundation study. Despite the economic difficulties, HBCUs should not lose relevance within the nation.
In the past 20 years, five HBCUs, which are institutions of higher learning founded with the mission to educate black Americans during times of legalized school segregation, have closed. The financial failings came after years of government funding being scaled back and administrative faults in budgeting, according to The New York Times.
The 2008 recession also took a particularly hard toll on the HBCU system because those institutions usually have smaller endowments and receive fewer private donations than other schools to begin with. The repercussions of the recession are still impacting the schools; last week, Howard University, one of the top-performing HBCUs, announced that it would be eliminating 200 staff positions by the end of the year.
As an unintended consequence of desegregation in the mid-20th century with rulings such as Brown vs. Board of Education in 1950, many top-performing black students opted to attend highly ranked universities outside of the HBCU system. Since then, the enrollment at most of the 105 HBCUs in the nation has seen a severe decline. At Fisk University in Nashville, TN for example, enrollment in the 1970s was at 1,500. This year, 645 students attend the university, according to The New York Times. In addition, only 3 percent of graduating high school seniors enrolled in HBCUs in 2013, resulting in fewer black students receiving degrees from HBCUs.
The struggle these colleges and universities are currently experiencing technically only affects 3 percent of all the country’s universities, but the impact of their closures will resonate nationwide. In the 21st century, HBCUs are reaping a greater diversity of students. Though black students make up 81 percent of HBCUs, the student body is also made of 11 percent white students, 3 percent Latino students and 1 percent Asian students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Therefore, if HBCUs failed to exist any longer in the United States, it could have a cross-cultural impact.
In addition, these colleges, which are largely concentrated in the South, are models of educational aspirations for communities that often have extremely limited access to education. Proximity of quality schools can help students succeed. Furthermore, the makeup of HBCUs will soon reflect the shifts in demographics of the U.S. to a majority of citizens coming from minority groups. With their rich history in cultural studies, these schools will be amply prepared to serve the needs of future generations.
Though HBCUs would benefit if they were funded through federal government funding and private donations from alums, this transition period for HBCUs could be a Renaissance moment. Previously regarded as a place for middle-class students to attend school, these southern colleges and universities can modernize their curriculum and make it applicable to the students around them. Currently, approximately 34 percent of the student body at HBCUs are low-income students. If HBCUs focus on educating lower-income students and providing them with skills that will serve their communities, then they will continue to serve their function by aiding underserved communities.
Despite HBCU’s lower enrollment numbers, their relevance — especially to the black community — remains high. USC, for example, maintains a yearly HBCU Exchange Program through which undergraduates can study at Howard or Spelman College for a semester. Directors at the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs said the exchange program offers students an opportunity to experience a school culture and climate that is different from one they are used to at USC.
HBCUs filled a void in educational opportunities when there were no other options for disenfranchised students of color. In the same way today, these colleges and universities that, once given the financial assistance to lift themselves, can continue to uplift communities lacking access to higher education. Because with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other greats as listed alums, HBCUs have a pretty good track record going for them.

Don, 
I don’t know who told you that HBCUs are segregated institutions. HBCUs have white, Latino, and Asian students, there are just more black students; much like we here at USC have a majority of white students.  And I don’t understand your “vehement” displeasure  with their existence. Both of my parents went to an HBCU and thoroughly enjoyed the culture and experience they had. There is something about the experience that you will never understand because you didn’t attend one.  As for your statement about “Historically White Colleges,” well that’s the same reason there’s no such thing as White History Month. It’s because every college in the United States is pretty much considered Historically White when you consider their past. 
HBCUs already receive pitiful funding and to make a statement that they need to disappear as if they are hurting somebody just seems a little overboard and unaccepting. They do not turn away applicants because of race and are not “segregated” institutions. If you take the time to research their recruiting process that you seem to believe is biased toward blacks, you’ll discover that they recruit in southern high school just like any other college would. And lastly, I wish you wouldn’t try to make HBCUs out to be villains and white people the victims when you know for a fact that blacks struggle to get accepted into the other 97% of colleges nationwide. If white people truly wanted to attend an HBCU, they would, there is nothing holding them back from getting accepted into one.
Not that it matters, but USC does not have a majority of white students.  Here are the most recent demographics I could find on an official USC site, from Fall 2012:
Asians 23%
Black/African-American 5%
Hispanic 14%
White/Caucasian 39%
International 12%
Other 7%
The demographics you just provided confirm that Whites are indeed the majority, comprising the largest percentage of the student body out of any other race in at the school.
I think after looking up the definition of majority, you’ll realize your mistake.
If you want to split hairs, enrollment by race is greater among whites. Good job completely missing the point of what I was saying.
Also, I’m sure you’re familiar with the fact that some words have multiple definitions. If you look up “majority” in the dictionary you’ll discover that one of three definitions is “the greater number.”
Jordyn Holman writes well, but I disagree with her vehemently. The historically black colleges belong in the unhappy past, with other institutions and symbols of racial discrimination. How would we feel about “historically white colleges” that take pride in being only for the white race? Correct. Few would regard that as desirable, regardless of what was “historical.” To uphold a racially separate college makes no sense today and is contrary to what blacks and whites have fought to achieve. So what should happen? All colleges and universities should recruit in such a way as to promote diversity among qualified applicants.
As for “relevant,” relevant to what? To a continued sense of alienation and separateness from other races? How can that be good? If these colleges provide a good and helpful education to their students and graduates, they should be advanced and marketed as that for all races, not as “special” for “this selected race” because that was the only way they could operate in the past.
No, Jordyn. Black colleges, white colleges or any other racially segregated institutions should disappear as quickly as possible in favor of equal opportunities for qualified entrants of any race. Continued racial discrimination for “historical,” “traditional,” “sentimental” or any other reason is a repugnant idea to be discarded as quickly as possible. .
