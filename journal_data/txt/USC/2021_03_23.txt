Los Angeles County entered the red tier Mar. 15, accelerating USC’s efforts for increased in-person campus activities, Provost Charles Zukoski said in a Universitywide email Tuesday. 
Given the new guidelines, research activity will be increased to full capacity, libraries will allow for increased density, on-campus museums will begin to open at limited capacity and outdoor intramural and club sports will be available for students living on or around campus, the email read.
“The physical distancing, the washing of the hands, the wearing of masks — these remain very important for the next many months because this is a serious disease, and it kills people and so we have to take it seriously,” Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Within those guidelines and as the tiers open up I encourage students to come to campus and participate as is appropriate.”
Current undergraduate students are now allowed to take up to 32 units pass / no pass toward their degree — an increase from the previous 24 — and the grading option will be offered for Summer 2021 courses. Additionally, students who were enrolled in fewer than a combined 30 units during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 may be eligible to apply for the summer Academic Progress Scholarship. 
Zukoski also said the University is aware of the benefits of remote work and will consider offering such opportunities in coming semesters. 
“There is a general sense that a lot of the administrative functions of the University have functioned pretty well under [the coronavirus], so we’re trying to understand what we’ve learned and how we can continue to provide the best service for faculty, students and staff and optimize where people are work to have a happy and engaged workforce,” Zukoski told the Daily Trojan. 
Some professors are also looking to implement innovative teaching methods they’ve learned due to virtual learning in the in-person classroom, Zukoski said. 
“We have some faculty who believe that teaching online actually is more effective than teaching in person [for] certain aspects,” Zukoski said. “That’s the sort of thing that we’re learning about and trying to capture and work with people on … how do you use the online capabilities that we’ve developed and learned how to use in order to actually enhance education.” 
In addition to the coronavirus updates, Zukoski’s email announced a 2% tuition increase for the 2021-22 school year was approved by the Board of Trustees. Student activities fees will also revert to pre-pandemic prices at $499 each semester for undergraduate students.

On paper, USC alumnus James Martinez’s journey to his current and recently attained position as a trustee on the Fresno County Board of Education seems almost inevitable, but his decision to run for office was partly born out of a desire to see more representation in local politics. He had no idea how big a role his identity would actually play as the first openly LGBTQ+ man elected to public office in Fresno.
“I felt that this was something that I just needed to do, that this was the next step that I could take to continue impacting my community and making change,” said Martinez, a USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism alumnus who has been involved in politics since the age of 18. 
His first job was as an assistant to a local city council member in Fresno’s city hall, where he was trusted enough to be asked to mentor the incoming councilman. He continued to work his way up, working for former Calif. Sen. Barbara Boxer in her Fresno office and eventually becoming a field representative for former United States senator Kamala Harris in the Central Valley. 
“It’s pretty surreal to know that your former boss is the Vice President of the United States,” Martinez said.
However, the road hasn’t been easy. Growing up, Martinez and his mother experienced food, housing and transportation insecurity, having to take public transport or walk to run errands and get groceries, an even more grueling task in the hot Fresno summers. Martinez’s late mother was also his biggest supporter and the reason he decided to run for office. 
“She was the type of woman that never stopped and never let anything prevent her from doing what needed to be done,” Martinez said. “She always encouraged me to dare to dream and to never give up and don’t back down.” 
He relied on various programs and support services at the community college level to help him through his high school and undergraduate education. In high school, he was a part of the Upward Bound program and was accepted to the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program in a cohort of fewer than 30 students for the duration of high school, where he got to know Jimi Rodgers, the counselor assigned to the program.
Rodgers continued to be a friend and mentor to Martinez, watching as he progressed from the ambitious student who once spent afternoons, at times unsupervised, hanging out in her office to building a career in politics.
“I don’t think he would have won this election if people did not believe that he was a very trustworthy individual and very ethical,” said Rodgers, now a retired head counselor for the Fresno Unified School District. “For a kid to hang around my office all the time and I could walk in and out and I knew that I could trust him. Yeah, he has my trust.”
Martinez recently joined Rodgers on the board of the Economic Opportunities Commission and their relationship has come full circle from student and counselor to colleagues, which Rodgers said has been an honor.
As he navigated jobs, higher education and a budding career in politics, Martinez was also coming to terms with his identity as an LGBTQ+ man. During his time in college, through his house and pet sitting business, he met Thad Mummert and Will Siegried, a couple who would come to be lifelong friends and mentors to Martinez and whose relationship inspired him to come out. Mummert and Siegfried have also been keen supporters of Martinez’s achievements.
“His ability to juggle a lot of things and work as hard as he does is very impressive,” said Mummert, a retired founder of a wholesale food company. “And he’s a really bright, promising, fascinating young man.” 
“It’s unbelievable what he’s been able to do,” said Siegfried, a retired psychiatrist. “The word for me is gobsmacked!”
Martinez continues to break barriers in Fresno County, succeeding his colleague and friend Nelson Esparza, who was the second Latinx person to sit on the Fresno County Board of Education. 
“It really spells out for folks that we live in a different time than we used to, and that you can be yourself, express yourself and that’s widely accepted,” said Esparza, a Fresno city council member and professor of economics at Fresno City College. 
The pair are both members of the Fresno County Young Democrats, where Martinez also succeeded Esparza as the president. Having worked with him in multiple positions, Esparza saw in Martinez a fellow dedicated public servant.
“James never made it about himself, he always made it about the larger cause and the community,” Esparza said. “So we certainly have that in common.” 
Martinez’s journey embracing his truth has also made him more determined to provide LGBTQ+ youth with resources to support them. This includes the establishment of LGBTQ+ and transgender youth mental health services and designated safe spaces as well as informing instructors of how they can best approach and support students coming to terms with their identity to foster a safe environment for them in their schools and classrooms. 
With a campaign team made up of primarily LGBTQ+ youth, Martinez has seen firsthand how important his position as an openly LGBTQ+ individual in public office has been for empowering and advocating for LGBTQ+ youth in Fresno County. Nevertheless, Martinez is determined to do right by all the students in his Area 3 district, addressing issues that pertain to any and all of them. 
“I’m very conscientious that I represent a much bigger constituency than just LGBTQ+ [people],” he said. “I have to represent all of my district and all of my students.” 
His plans for his term prove that he aspires to do just that.
Martinez intends to implement more green infrastructure initiatives in his district, including the installation of solar panels on all educational buildings as well as ensuring students have access to green spaces, especially during the coronavirus pandemic when many of them are stuck at home.
The pandemic has also highlighted other issues that need to be tackled. As schools switched to virtual learning, the assumption has been that students would have access to the internet and the technology required to attend classes and complete assignments online. However, the arrangement has no doubt caused significant stress to families already experiencing financial difficulties, and Martinez intends to address these pressing challenges for his constituents in Fresno County. 
Providing hotspots and broadband access for students is paramount for Martinez, as well as finding ways to bring down the price of internet connectivity even by a small amount, which can substantially alleviate the financial burden for many families. 
Before the USC student body was forced to reckon with the difficulties accompanying virtual learning, Martinez already had the experience of completing his graduate degree virtually, graduating from Annenberg’s online master’s of communication management program in 2018. 
For Martinez, Annenberg’s online program allowed him to pursue a master’s in communication while also staying home with his late mother, who was battling several ailments. 
“It requires an incredible amount of focus and discipline,” Martinez said. His ability to balance the rigorous course load while also working full time is a testament to his dedication and ambition that those around him are constantly in awe of. 
“He works terribly hard, and he always has ever since we’ve known him,” Mummert said. 
Martinez’s loved ones look forward to watching him continue to grow. 
“I expect to see him just keep growing and growing and growing and do increasingly wonderful things,” Mummert said. “And I hope that the two of us are around for another 20 or 30 years to see it happen.”
For now, Martinez is steadfastly focused on his current position and those that he represents.
“I’m happy where I am,” he said. “I want to see what I can do with this position and how I can leverage it to implement effective change here.”

Indie singer-songwriter and 2020 graduate Nat Lee, also known as Manley, has been hard at work; just a few weeks ago, they released their second EP, “I Picked My Scab and Now There’s a Scar.”
“This is an EP that I’m really proud of,” Manley said. “I feel like you can really hear my evolution in it.”
Manley, a music industry major, started writing and playing music their freshman year of college after taking a songwriting class. But their musical journey started much earlier; when they were younger, Manley says their passion was for drumming.
“My parents wanted me to learn piano and violin … I just wanted to rock out and hit stuff, just bang out on the drum kit, so that’s where I started,” they said.
Manley didn’t get fully into songwriting until their first year at USC when they had to write and perform songs in front of other students. 
“I did not know how to play guitar very well. I had never written a full song or anything. That class really pushed me out of my comfort zone,”Manley said. “That’s when I decided I can keep writing songs, like beyond the class … it really just comes down to how you feel where the song should go.”
Since then, they started giving themself more room to write and create music outside of academic settings. They said their process is slower now since they like to sit with music and give themself time to revisit it rather than setting hard deadlines. Manley says it’s a more productive way of expressing themself, and they’re now able to set time aside to look back at what they’ve written.
“I have to be in a very particular mood to write music, and a lot of my songs are really emo and sad, so typically … playing guitar and singing what’s on my mind is my coping mechanism. It’s my way of life, my creative outlet when I’m sad,” they said.
Manley describes their music as “indie, gay, kind of rock,” and that took inspiration from many indie artists, such as Soccer Mommy and Phoebe Bridgers, as well as from their own platonic and romantic relationships. 
Over the last year, Manley wrote and produced “I Picked My Scab and Now there’s a Scar” with the help of Andrew Perrea, a fellow music industry alumnus.
“I just thought the songs were so charming. The guitars and the melodies and the soft-spoken lyricism was really cool and shown through the very extreme low-fi-ness of the demos,” Perrea said. “I love their music but it is very … it’s dark, it’s emotional. So personally, I found as I was working on the EP, I personally was kind of really going through all the emotions that Nat went through.”
Manley mentioned that their ability to produce the EP was limited because they originally recorded and mixed it in their garage while living in Los Angeles. Their equipment was limited, and when they started, Manley said they had to “hunker down in [their] garage and lay down a lot of tracks.” They also had to take some creative liberties to get the sounds they wanted such as transposing a guitar down enough to sound like a bass and working with only one audio interface. 
“I would spend hours in there super late at night re-recording the same thing over and over again until I was happy,” they said. “And then my getting really frustrated because I don’t know how the fancy software works, and it’s a lot of Googling, a lot of self-teaching, a lot of trial and error. And I’ve been able to find the way to do things the way I like it.”
Perrea said the limited equipment made it a challenge to mix, especially because he wanted to make everything shine.
“They sent me demos for the four songs, sort of one-by-one. Not all together at once, which is kind of how I got started with it. It was just a song-by-song basis,” Perrea said. “They sent me over their Ableton sessions, and I just started kind of imagining what it could be. I definitely got a lot of like Snail Mail, Soccer Mommy vibes off of it and really wanted to try to take it in that direction sonically, kind of taking the covers off the music [and] letting it get brighter and shine.”
Fellow USC alumnus and indie artist, flora, says Manley’s style was one of the reasons they were attracted to their music in the first place. Manley says the two of them traded songs back and forth after they first met through Manley’s organization of shows for queer artists and artists of color.
“I feel like sometimes it’s hard to find smaller artists that have music released that sounds really clean and really polished, so when they send me demos I was like, ‘what do you mean [you’re] an organizer … this stuff is really good,’” flora said. 
They mentioned Manley’s song “Mooncakes” holds a special place in their heart because the music video was sent to them for Do Over Fest, and it especially stands out because of the sweet, emotional, familial vibe the song has.
Both flora and Manley said their favorite song on the EP was “How To Love Again.” They said the song is about being in a traumatic relationship and “being unsure how to navigate future relationships.” They said they’re able to look back and see the things they still have to learn, which they say makes the song special to them, especially in their current relationship.
“When I look at it I see a lot of growth,” Manley said. “Now I get to be really much more vulnerable and raw and honest with my music.”
Manley’s music, including “I Picked My Scab and Now There’s a Scar,” is available to listen to on all streaming platforms.

I will not say this perfectly.
I will not say this perfectly. 
I will not say this perfectly, but if I do not say it at all, it will sit inside me. It will slowly pull me apart. And it will be passed on to my children the same way my mother’s story and her mother’s before her live — and sometimes tremble — within me now. 
My name is Julia Lin, and I am the social media director for the Daily Trojan.
A lot of you might not even know this position exists, or you might think it’s not real journalism, or that all I do is post on Instagram. 
But it’s a job I take seriously. It’s one that I think is important — connecting our generation, which barely reads the news, to the stories that shape our futures. 
Last week, it felt like a heavy position to hold. I felt no desire to post stories on our Instagram. I felt exhausted every time I opened the app to see headlines or blanket posts that didn’t address the truth of our diasporic experiences shared on social media without thought or self-reflection. I felt guilty when the Daily Trojan had no articles to share that acknowledged the trauma many in our own newsroom were experiencing. I felt trapped by the knowledge that I have access to a platform, but wasn’t using it to share resources. 
There are a million things to say. A million things on my mind. I’m thinking about what it feels like to be an Asian American woman. I’m thinking about learning to check behind me no matter where I am, and the way such targeted acts of violence on my own community only serve to substantiate those fears. I’m thinking about the deceptively dangerous rise of the Instagram infographic and the power of social media. And I’m thinking about the privilege I have to be an aspiring journalist and to be able to access things like USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Daily Trojan, but also the ways these things have continued to fail me. 
Last week, I watched the journalism industry that I aspire to be in do, frankly, a terrible job reporting on what had happened. I thought about writing to process or to call for action but let myself cry instead. I let myself be tired, frustrated. I let myself not have the words. But I also felt the relentless pressure I know many journalists feel when the speed of the news cycle means that allowing myself to process means that, by the time the pain subsides enough for coherent sentences to form, it’s already too late. 
The news lets these stories come in waves, but the reality of these experiences is a constant feeling of trying to stay afloat. 
I feel a deep responsibility every time these big moments of increased “awareness” happen. I feel as if I’m supposed to magically be able to solve all of these issues by figuring out just what to say or post for the paper. I find myself wondering if everyone will hate me if I don’t find something meaningful to share from the few stories we have about these issues. What does it mean to be an audience engagement editor? How can I engage you all in conversations that I am still learning how to have? I put a lot of pressure on myself to handle these things perfectly. The past few days, that pressure has left me completely unsure of what to do next. 
Sometimes this job is fun Twitter threads and Instagram polls. Sometimes it feels empty, performative, hopeless. 
Last week was, among many things, a reminder for me that these issues — of white supremacy, the myth of the model minority, of misogyny, hypersexualization and dehumanization — won’t be solved on social media. 
This is not to excuse myself from actively reflecting on the stories we share, and it is certainly not to excuse our paper from the holes our coverage has had again and again. But it is to allow me to think deeper on where I fall within it all. 
Social media is a unique and powerful platform, but it has allowed us to become dangerously complacent. It has made sharing an Instagram story a one-and-done box on some imaginary “activist checklist.” 
Your Asian friends know what happened. We heard it from our mothers crying on the phone. We had it thrown at us in palatable Instagram stories. Spit in our face, and whispered towards our backs. 
What we don’t know is what you’re doing to tangibly change the circumstances that leave us living in a constant state of fear that has become so second nature we sugarcoat and say we’re just anxious.  
I’ll be honest. I’m hating on social media hard for someone who wants to be an audience journalist. For someone who shares these posts too. For someone who recognizes that sharing is a huge part of spreading news, especially these days when more and more people get their information from digital platforms. And sharing is great. Awareness is too. 
But when sharing an Instagram post becomes an excuse not to do anything else, problems arise. And with USC students especially, I watch this happen again and again. I’ve watched hundreds of people sharing solidarity posts for communities of color on Instagram only to turn around and go to massive parties in the heart of South Central L.A. during the middle of a pandemic. I’ve had friends tweet and post and comment but not know how to have a real conversation about why last week’s news was so heavy for me. Social media allows us to pretend we are something we’re not. It allows us to make others believe, and in the process, it allows us to trick and excuse ourselves from doing the real work. 
I want to bring myself back to the reasons I felt called to write today — the broader institution of journalism and audience engagement itself, and the ways the shortcomings of these fields are constantly reflected online and at USC. 
This looks like the “fault lines” presentation students in Annenberg get every semester, which gives surface level information on diversity and inclusion in journalism, and it looks like the exhaustion students of color feel when we watch our white classmates walk away still not understanding how the language they use can harm.
It looks like all of the ways we are taught to write and interview and pitch that perpetuate the systems of implicit and explicit racism that are directly in line with the power dynamics that not only allowed but empowered last week’s act of violence and the following miscoverage to occur. 
This looks like AP style being the supposed exemplary model of journalism, but the Associated Press reporting that maybe it wasn’t a hate crime just because the perpetrator himself said it wasn’t one. 
This looks like being told not to use the word “spaces” when that is the only word I can find to describe the abstract place I desire simply to be seen when every other institution has failed me. 
Maybe, for some, social media is that space. Maybe this intersection between the news and the internet is one that will always feel challenging to navigate. Maybe I will always feel like I am floating in the space between awareness and performing. Maybe as an Asian American, I am used to floating.  
Maybe audience engagement means just being willing to ask you all what space you need. And how I can best create it. 
Maybe to do well in this position I need to get over this fear of not getting it perfect. This fear of never being heard. Maybe this looks like forgiving myself, continuing to learn and unlearn, providing support when I can, and asking for support when I need.  
Maybe you’ll stumble across this piece on social media. Maybe — hopefully — it will make you feel the tiniest bit seen.

When Sachin Narayan noticed how under-resourced populations have very little access to healthcare products and services others may get at the store or doctor’s office, he decided to begin Cathartic.  
“I’ve been really blessed and fortunate to be in a position where I think everything that I had to care about my preventative health, whether it was a Band-Aid … or it was a lotion bottle, if it was soap, it was sunscreen, it was multivitamins — whatever it may be, I sort of had that at my arms reach,” said Narayan, a junior majoring in global health. “I think that for a lot of us who do have that access, it causes us to turn a blind eye to the fact that most people … don’t have easy access to what we’ve not even considered as preventive health measures.”
After a year and a half working on ideas to improve nonprofit healthcare with Dr. Terry Church, an assistant professor of regulatory and quality sciences, Narayan asked Joseph Naseib and Anna Greer to start Cathartic with him. The three met through Los Angeles Community Impact, a student organization that provides pro-bono consulting services to socially-minded organizations in L.A., to create a preventative medicine nonprofit. The nonprofit, Cathartic, would work to connect donors of health necessities with suppliers that can help those in need within the community. 
“We were hoping to sort of tackle a lot of the preventative health inequities that we see in our urban communities specifically by trying to get the most important stakeholders to the table to engage in the collective public health of our communities,” said Narayan, who now serves as Cathartic’s CEO. 
According to Greer, a sophomore majoring in political economy and Cathartic’s chief marketing officer, there’s a “massive percentage” of Americans who can’t afford the services provided by the U.S. healthcare system. 
“It’s just really sad that it affects people’s fundamental well-being to not have money,” Greer said. “Anything I can do to sort of make our health system in the U.S. just a little bit more equitable … makes me just feel better to know that there are people out there pushing to make this change because I don’t think that anybody deserves to face dire health consequences.” 
Cathartic is currently in the process of launching their pilot program, the Skin Protection Program, where they have been accepting a variety of sunscreen donations from different corporate sponsors, such as USC and Keck Street Medicine, to distribute to local organizations. They are also working to have health education resources given out with the sunscreen distribution in order for people to know exactly how to use the products they receive. 
The inspiration to launch the Skin Protection Program was the fact that individuals facing homelessness have abnormally high rates of skin cancer and other skin diseases, as well as general uncomfortability and danger for infections. 
“Something that you and I can get very easily, like sunscreen and lotion to keep our skin moisturized and protect it from UVA and UVB rays, those are very simple things that we can just pick up at CVS that obviously unhoused people do not have access to and can’t afford,” Greer said. 
Beyond the Skin Protection Project, Cathartic hopes to address the lack of responsive healthcare as a whole for underprivileged communities. This creates a focus on “preventative healthcare,” specifically focusing on products that help to prevent more serious illnesses, such as skin cancer, as well as adapting to the current infrastructure of health in the community.
“[Preventative healthcare] means providing health education on when you should be visiting your doctor, how to take care of your body in general and … alleviating fears from visiting the doctor,” said Nasieb, a sophomore majoring in human biology and Cathartic’s chief operating officer. 
The organization requires a lot of outreach, particularly when it comes to finding donors to supply distributors with, Greer said. Narayan, Naseib and Greer did a lot of cold outreach to locate products and were able to receive approximately $25,000 worth of sunscreen.
Cathartic’s ultimate goal is to have a matching site where suppliers can share products and distributors can place requests in order to be matched together, serving as many nonprofits, in L.A. and beyond, as possible, Naseib said.
“We definitely want this to continue to grow and become the real leader in the industry for this sort of product,” Greer said. “In the future, we really see this being a leading platform in the CSR and the giving industry.”

To preface, this column has certainly been a joy to write and research, learning not only about the hoops and hurdles but also the joys and feel-good moments that older adults go through as they progress across the lifespan. As a gerontology student, it’s been a bit of an academic journey having the opportunity to hear back from other, much more prestigious writers in the gerontology community and receive their feedback. However, even after hearing from colleagues and scouring the Internet for what to tackle next, I found myself skimming through the same topics time and time again. 
I often read through the prominent news sources for older adults; we’re talking about the Next Avenue, AARP, the Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and Milken Institute on the Future of Aging’s of the world. Paula Span’s “The New Old Age” column in The New York Times also sheds some very helpful light on the conversation in the aging world. 
However, all of these sources, myself included, essentially give off the same impression: We must improve our attitudes on aging and change our rhetoric on the world of aging and figure out the future of aging after the pandemic. 
If we look at Span’s column, if it’s not about kidney disease, it’s about cancer; it’s about dementia; it’s about prediabetes — you catch my drift. Many of the news and media hits that professors in the Leonard Davis School are involved with include the same topics, from healthy eating to risk factors that could lead to neurodegenerative diseases later in life. 
It honestly felt a bit degrading to just skim through those article titles, imagining that at some point, I may have to figure out all of those things for myself too. So, it’s no wonder that people really don’t want to age and have negative stereotypes about the aging process.
Consequently, I came to the conclusion that the gerontology conversation was done, that the conversation had essentially become a broken record stuck on fixing the medical narrative. I realized that I am guilty of this too. In reviewing the titles of my past columns, I realized that they gave off the same impressions as the news sources previously mentioned. To be fair, I don’t think that I’m in a position to radically change the conversation either. But, before my feet get stuck to this soapbox, let’s take a look at what we can do and what’s really going on. 
Let’s put it this way. The conversation on aging and older adults as a whole still is not over, but it seems to have come to a standstill. Aging is inherently in everything that we do. Change in our values, interests and ideals across the lifespan is part of that. We can have conversations about older adults and aging in the context of technology, business, medicine and the arts. In an academic institution, it makes sense that all of the work we cover in gerontology relates to the science of aging, particularly what makes it tick and how we can improve it. 
However, what about aging in the movie or theater industry? What about older adults in the agriculture sector and how technology is playing a role in transforming their way of life? Or what about that one random older guy in Greece who’s competing against large corporations in creating delicious pastries from phyllo?
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader asks. “All of these questions are suitable for the conversation on aging and, frankly, are a bit niche in nature. I get that aging is this overarching, timeless theme of humanity, but what’s your point?”
Did I just act passive-aggressively against myself? Yeah, I did. But have faith that it’s for good reason. Time and time again, members and academics in the aging community ask, ponder and research the tough questions. But in doing so, they often direct the narrative of aging into one that relies heavily on statistics and science. 
Movements to recognize older adults on the big screen or in the workplace may fall short given the push in the direction of STEM. That’s not to say it’s particularly a bad thing, but there’s a whole world of conversation that we’re missing out on. The issues go both ways, with younger individuals believing that the wires, pills and hospital bills are synonymous with age and with older adults not being able to see that there’s an opportunity to adjust with digital natives. 
But at the same time, we must face the facts. Age is part of physical development, and many of those developments include the degeneration of certain parts of the body after decades of use. Varying healthy practices can help reduce chances of a neurodegenerative or chronic disease, but science shows that it is the older generation that most often encounters these issues. 
Where can we improve? Well, like many questions similar in nature, it’s a loaded answer. There needs to be a push in diversifying the research and work done on behalf of older adults. Plenty of the research that currently circulates academic classrooms has an emphasis on certain races and socioeconomic groups. 
For instance, there’s a clear and alarming lack of data on older Black women aging within their local community regardless of age and independent of any external assistance, otherwise known as “aging in place.” Marginalized groups are left out of the picture, meaning that interventions and solutions passed on their behalf may end up just being completely lackluster. We need to diversify the conversation on aging into other areas, looking at older adults outside of the traditional medical narrative. Age Inclusion in Media is one of very few outlets looking at older adults’ representation on the big screen (along with other handful recommendations).
The conversation needs to continue moving forward, and we’re far from reaching full circle on this narrative. However, as we continue to explore new avenues of discussion, it is important that we recognize the diversity and individuality of each and every niche that is impacted by aging. 
Hopefully in the future, we can reflect on the foundation that we’re building today when it comes to improving the aging process, thinking, “Back in my day…”

Since the coronavirus first brought the world to a halt in March 2020, Europe’s “top-five” soccer leagues have made changes to their rulebooks to accommodate clubs, players and managers. The decision to allow managers to make five substitutions per game as opposed to three has given clubs the flexibility to cope with a heavily condensed schedule. So why did England’s Premier League vote against the “five-sub” rule multiple times this season?
In their return to play last summer, the English Football League and Premier League both voted to allow the “five-sub” rule in England’s top two divisions. Prior to and throughout this season, however, England’s top-flight has axed the idea of allowing five substitutions per game to continue. 
The English Premier League usually kicks its season off in early August, but after last season ended in July instead of May due to the pandemic, the league was forced to delay the start of its current season. Instead of sliding the start date back the full two months to mirror last season’s overage and allow players to rest, the league voted to push the season’s start back just one month. On top of deciding to start the season in September, the league voted to retain its usual final matchday in May. While this decision was likely made in effort to minimize any further disruption to the European soccer calendar caused by the pandemic, it severely neglects the best interests of the league’s most important asset: its players.
While the Premier League wasn’t the only sanctioning body to heavily cut into its players’ offseason, it was the only one to force clubs into making just three substitutions per game despite such an unprecedented spike in injuries to players caused by the lack of rest dating back to last season.
Of Europe’s “top-five” leagues, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga, France’s Ligue 1 and Spain’s La Liga voted to allow the five-subsitute policy to continue this season — with the Premier League as the only exception. 
What’s even more infuriating is the fact that the previously mentioned EFL, which basically sanctions England’s “minor league” professional soccer, voted to allow the “five-sub” rule this season as well. So, to recap, essentially every top European league and even England’s lower divisions voted to allow clubs to continue substituting five players per game as a way to prevent injuries and excessive fatigue. Given the lack of an offseason, the condensed club schedule and the spike in player injuries it seems like the right thing to do.
For an example of the congestion in this season’s schedule, look at the Premier League’s Tottenham Hotspur. From Sep. 13 to Mar. 14 last season, Tottenham played 39 matches. This season, that number is up to 46. Tottenham played once every four days on average during this 186-day span, losing almost a full day of rest in between games compared to last season. There was a 57-day span from late November to early January this season where Tottenham played 16 games, averaging just over three days of rest in between games. The increase in physical and mental demand from players has undoubtedly been reflected on the injury sheet as players have gone down with injuries, particularly muscle injuries, at a higher rate than ever before. While it’s impossible for a soccer league to prevent its players from picking up injuries, there are certain situations where I’m sure fans, managers and players would appreciate a little support. This is one of them. Whatever tradition the league is trying to preserve needs to go out of the window, otherwise the league will start to lose quality in its product.  
So if the Premier League and its managers are worried about scaring off investors by manipulating the rule book to allow teams to protect their players from overload, they should think about the bigger picture. The players, specifically stars, are the product. When they don’t play, the league pays, metaphorically.
In the first nine days of the season, injuries were already up 23% from the same period last season, according to Premier Injuries. In the months since, things haven’t really gotten any better, with star after star being lost due to injury. Faces of the league such as Liverpool’s Virgil Van Dijk, Tottenham’s Son Heung-min and Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero are just some of the countless Premier League players who have missed time this season with muscle injuries. 
Yet here we are, with less than 10 games left in the season, and it looks like the Premier League will get away with unnecessarily risking player fitness. 
But guess what? 
Seasons are wrapping up in Europe’s other top four leagues too. And in England’s lower professional leagues. So while the Premier League was obsessing over maintaining some sort of image or reputation, their competitors were showing them how it’s done, getting through their season on time and without a massive spike in injuries.
