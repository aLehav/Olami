Former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush will visit USC on Nov. 19 as part of the President’s Distinguished Lecture Series.
L.A. Weekly released an email sent from Lisa Ebiner Gavit, secretary of the USC College Republicans, to the club’s membership on Monday. In the email, Gavit asked members to keep the meeting confidential. Students in the club could email their USC ID numbers and the former president’s staff would email them a formal invitation to the event on Nov. 18.
Some USC donors also received invitations to an event on Nov. 19 at 6:45 p.m. in Bovard Auditorium with the former president and first lady Laura Bush as part of the President’s Distinguished Lecture Series. USC Media Relations has confirmed that Bush will be speaking on Nov. 19 as part of the Lecture Series.
The President’s Distinguished Lecture Series is a program that began under former USC President Steven Sample with the intention of  bringing international leaders to speak on campus. Last October, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates spoke as part of the series.
USC College Republican President Jennifer Massey told L.A. Weekly that the secrecy surrounding the event was to ensure that USC students attended the event.
“I think because the last time he was here, there weren’t students,” she told L.A. Weekly. “They wanted to make sure students were there.”
Massey also said that the former first lady will likely also be in attendance, something the invitation to the Nov. 19 event corroborates.
“From what I’ve heard, everyone’s really excited,” Massey told L.A. Weekly. “Personally, I’m very excited. I’ve never met a president before.”
This report has been updated to reflect that USC Media Relations confirmed that the event is part of the USC President’s Distinguished Lecture Series and will occur on Nov. 19.
Is there another way for a USC student to get an invitation to this event other than being a member of USC College Republicans?  I would very much like to go.
Hey Matt.  What’s in a poll, right?  They’re just numbers…
Well a new #Gallup poll shows Americans view our current president very much the same as they did President GW Bush.  At the same point in their presidencies, the two are neck and neck with public opinion.  According to Gallup, Bush even comes out a point  ahead.  Gotta love it!  
Now I didn’t agree with everything the polls may have shown about GW back then.  I’m guessing you may or may not agree with people’s view of our current president as well.  Hey, but polls are polls…so it must be true that the current president is on track to be, as you put it…. “one of the most disgraced presidents of all time”
It’s much easier to sit in our arm chairs and judge than to be responsible for decisions affecting the future of a nation.  Time has a way of providing clarity and understanding….
Too bad Matt.  Suck it up.  I’m thrilled G.W. Is coming!  I’m mortified Sol Proce hired Mayor Villaragosa as a professor…
Why is one of the most disgraced presidents of all time speaking at a USC lecture series?  That’s honestly embarrassing for me as an alumnus.

A memorial service was held Monday evening in Bovard Auditorium in honor of the Thu Yain “Roy” Kyaw, a USC Marshall School of Business student who passed away Oct. 27. He was 22.
Beloved · Students gather outside Bovard Auditorium Monday evening in preparation for Thu “Roy” Yain Kyaw’s memorial service. – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
The USC Sirens commenced the service with a beautiful rendition of “Come Home” followed by Roy’s father Kyaw Kyaw’s tribute to his fallen son.
“Since he was young, I knew he was a good boy. I tried my best, whatever he needed — we supplied. Life is not only for ourselves — we have to help each other,” Kyaw said. “Everything of his lifetime … he gave us so much gifts.”
The Kyaw family is comprised of USC alumna Khant Khant, his sister; current USC student Arkar, his brother; his mother, Kyu Ayu Maw and his father. His parents traveled 20 hours from Yangon, Myanmar, Singapore to honor Roy’s life with the USC community.
Before attending USC, Roy served Singapore, his home country, with two years of service in the army as a 3rd sergeant, according to Khant Khant.
The Dean of the Marshall School, James G. Ellis, shared a few words at the service.
“Thoughtful, mature, wise, kind, deep thinker, warm-hearted — a leader. Roy was an embellishment of what a Marshall student is about,” Ellis said. “He was a Trojan.”
His close friends shared how focused he was on his studies, as they mentioned his diligence with his work in the libraries. Roy balanced his time, however, allowing him to remain active in his business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi.
Abigail Chao, Roy’s Big Sister within DSP, reminisced about her time with Roy and shared a saying Roy once told her that kept her humble.
“Roy told me once, almost in passing, ‘We are not only lucky to have people love us, but to have people to love,’” Chao said.
When Chao first met Roy, he told her that one of his lifelong dreams was to hang glide because he mentioned he often had vivid dreams of actual flying.
Together they flew through the trees in Big Bear, harnessed to a line in the mountains, that allowed them to zip through the air. Chao also mentioned how they “flew” down a path in Malibu on mountain bikes as well as other forms of “flying.”
Chris Sanchez, Roy’s pledge brother in DSP, said Roy was his best friend at USC. Sanchez mentioned that he felt he barely saw Roy be physically a part of his pledge class duties, though he later learned that Roy worked in silence.
“He did not need to be recognized, [though] he was known to be the backbone of our pledge class,” Sanchez said.
Hanna Hurr, the pledge mom of DSP, spoke about Roy’s kindness. On Valentine’s Day, she did not want to go out due to an overwhelming amount of work. Roy motivated another brother in DSP to surprise Hurr with classic Valentine gifts.
As Roy reasoned to Hurr, “Every girl should get something nice on Valentines day.”
The USC community came together to honor Roy’s life. The orchestra section of Bovard was filled, and many people, including professors and family members, shared stories about Roy.
“Roy’s life was an inspiration … and now all of us have a responsibility to carry on his legacy — to be strong,” said Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs in the Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

When Cynthia Cooper-Dyke was named the head coach for the USC women’s basketball team in April, she brought with her a promise to bring back a winning tradition to the program, similar to the one present when she played for the Women of Troy.
“For us, we are trying to develop a culture of winning and it starts with having that great level of work ethic,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We are starting to put in those pieces of the puzzle right now and we believe that it will translate into developing a winning mentality and putting some Ws up on the board.”
And Cooper-Dyke is not the only one. Athletic Director Pat Haden has said that the women’s basketball program has a long history of national championships. Yet Haden acknowledged that in recent years it has failed to live up to its history under the direction of former Lakers player Michael Cooper.
During Cooper’s four years as head coach, the Women of Troy had a 72-57 record, or an average winning percentage of .558, and he never led his team to the NCAA Tournament. Though Cooper led the team to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament title game in 2011, it failed to secure a title after losing to Toledo. Furthermore, after high early season expectations in the 2010-2013 seasons, the Women of Troy did not qualify for postseason play.
In fact, the last time Women of Troy reached the NCAA Tournament was in 2006, when the team went 18-11 before being knocked out in the second round of the tournament.
Cooper resigned after the team finished with a dismal 11-20 record, and 7-11 in the Pac-12, in the 2013 season. Cooper’s resignation led Haden to search for his new coach, who could return the program to its promised land — the NCAA Tournament.
By selecting former USC great Cooper-Dyke in April, he brought home an integral player who helped lead the Women of Troy to consecutive national championships during the 1983 and 1984 seasons. Cooper-Dyke, 49, looks to restore the program to its winning tradition and lay the foundation for a nationally renowned women’s basketball powerhouse.
“It’s going to be about changing the mentality into a winning one,” Cooper-Dyke said about transforming the program. “What I mean about turning it into a winning mentality is really changing the way we focus, the way we practice, adding more intensity and investing a great amount of energy in becoming the best, not only as a better team but as better individuals and players.”
Cooper-Dyke has acquired several accolades since playing as a Trojan. As a two-time WNBA MVP, four-time WNBA champion and the first WNBA player to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, Cooper-Dyke’s extensive professional experience helps her to relate with and establish a connection with her players.
“Players react differently to me as a coach because I was a player in the sport and the league that they want to be in,” Cooper-Dyke said. “In other words, I didn’t play in the NBA — I played in the WNBA. I feel that this makes a difference because the players can now relate a little bit more to me.”
Cooper has already demonstrated her influential coaching style during team practice and workouts.
“She’s really easy to talk to and is very open,” sophomore guard Brianna Barrett said. “She’s also a teaching coach, so if we had any questions, she stopped and helped us get through what we wanted to get through.”
Senior forward Cassie Harberts said Cooper’s and her similar paths have created a positive connection with her coach.
“She has a great sense of humor, has tons of energy and also is an alumna … so it is really easy to relate with her,” Harberts said. “She is so passionate and literally bleeds cardinal and gold.”
As Cooper-Dyke takes the lead in redirecting the women’s basketball program this coming season, she has already expressed her high expectations, goals that previously have seemed unattainable in past seasons.
“The team goal is always to win, but ultimately we want to win the Pac-12 conference and return to the NCAA Tournament,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We just have to be willing to put in the hard work that it takes to make that jump.”
While men’s head coach Andy Enfield, who is also in his first season at USC, looks to bring “Dunk City” to the Galen Center, Cooper-Dyke believes her team will be entertaining to watch.
“I would like us to play a style of basketball that is fun to watch and fun to play,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I don’t want us to get bogged down in the half-court set, and want us to get out in transition and go up and down the court.”
Ultimately, though, the only way Cooper-Dyke will be able to turn the program around is by landing big-time recruits. She believes that along with her assistant coaches, she can recruit more top-ranking players by emphasizing USC’s positive attributes.
“We have a wonderful arena to play in,” Cooper-Dyke said when referring to the Galen Center, “and we have top-notch academic services and training facilities, and now we just need the top-notch athletes who know that the greatest way to become a star in the NCAA and to leave a legacy is to really be the name and face that turned a program around.”
Cooper-Dyke has already picked up two transfers this season — junior forward Kaneisha Horn from Alabama and sophomore guard Alexis Lloyd from Virginia Tech.
At the end of the day, Cooper-Dyke was hired to redevelop the foundation of the USC women’s basketball program. Though she is already attracting top-notch recruits and gaining popularity with her players, she seeks to continue these positive strides by winning basketball games and returning the women’s basketball team to the promised land.

After a successful trip to the Bay Area that netted victories at Stanford and Cal, sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio and senior libero Natalie Hagglund were named Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week, respectively.
Lead the way · Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio leads the Women of Troy with 266 kills and 61 service aces this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Bricio, a sophomore from Guadalajara, Mexico, earns the offensive honor for the first time this season, after picking up five selections for Freshman of the Week last season. Bricio scored 18 points on Wednesday against Stanford to go with a career-high 23 digs. She also recorded two service aces in the match to help the Women of Troy to a thrilling five-set victory.
On Friday against Cal, Bricio played perhaps her best match of the season, recording five service aces to put her season total up to 61 -— good enough to break USC’s single-season record for service aces. In addition to her team-high 25 points in the match, Bricio took part in the Women of Troy’s stout defensive effort as well. Her four solo blocks led the team, and she contributed for four assisted blocks to lead the team with eight total blocks.
Hagglund, a senior looking to lead her team to the national championship in her final season, added to an already-stellar career during the week. In the first match at Stanford, she recorded 36 digs in five sets and tacked on a service ace to help the team on the offensive end. Hagglund outdid herself in the next match against Cal, recording the same amount of digs in just four sets. With 2,131 career digs, Hagglund has now moved into fifth all-time on the Pac-12 digs leaderboard and will continue to climb as the season nears its end.
Bricio’s most recent selection is the second of her career, and Hagglund’s defensive selection is the fifth of her career. With one more selection for a weekly award, Hagglund would become the most decorated Trojan ever in this category. USC has now received 57 weekly honors since the award’s inception in 1986.
The Women of Troy have two home matches this weekend, as they take on the Oregon Ducks on Friday and the Oregon State Beavers on Sunday at the Galen Center.

When the clock finally struck zero on the Reser Stadium scoreboard, making official USC’s dominant 31-14 victory over Oregon State, the Trojans’ sideline responded in a manner that it hadn’t in nearly a year and a half — jubilation.
Up until Saturday’s win in Corvallis, each of USC’s previous five wins brought about tame responses from the Trojan faithful. USC’s most one-sided victory — a 35-7 win against middling Boston College on Sept. 14 — was unimpressive and to be expected. The team’s most meaningful wins of the season — a 38-31 defeat of Arizona and a 19-3 victory over Utah — were decent, yet demonstrated two of the team’s most problematic perceived flaws — its secondary and its offensive line.
But against Oregon State on Friday, USC put together a complete performance, and came away with a rare road win in a game that the Trojans entered as five-point underdogs. More importantly, the team snapped its three-game losing streak at Reser Stadium, a poor stretch that clearly had an effect on the Trojans’ reaction to the win.
“It’s been a long time since USC’s won in Corvallis, so we’re glad to be able to stop that trend and get a win in a hostile environment,” senior outside linebacker Devon Kennard said. “We always said it’s been rough for USC to play here, and we put a stop to that tonight.”
Aside from a 14-second stretch in which Oregon State scored its only two touchdowns of the night, USC did a superb job of making everything look easy against the Beavers. The Trojans outgained OSU by 120 yards and forced quarterback Sean Mannion to throw three interceptions. For the first time all season, USC excelled in every facet of the game against a quality opponent, and judging by the players’ responses after the game, the win could spark the team to a strong finish.
“It was a huge win for us,” redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey said. “The year we went 10-2, it took a win going up and beating Oregon to get us going. Hopefully this win against Oregon State can do the same for us and we can just keep it rolling the rest of the way.”
Bailey’s reference to the Trojans’ 2011 upset over then-No. 4 Oregon at Autzen Stadium is both revealing of the program’s recent struggles and reassuring about the team’s remaining four games of the season.
After beating the Ducks, USC capped off its 2011 season with a memorable 50-0 dismantling of rival UCLA at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which helped the Trojans earn a preseason No. 1 ranking heading into the 2012 season. That year, USC’s most impressive victory was a road win against Washington, a Huskies team that finished the season 7-6.
The rest of the team’s wins were hardly anything to celebrate. Four of the seven teams USC defeated in 2012 — Hawai’i, Cal, Utah and Colorado — finished with a combined 12 wins. The other three wins — against Washington, Syracuse and Arizona State — did not necessarily garner much excitement from players or fans.
But Friday’s win felt different. For the first time since beating UCLA in 2011, fans, players and coaches alike could all agree — this was a big-time win. Sure, maybe the Beavers weren’t as good as people expected them to be, but Reser Stadium had owned USC for the better part of the past decade. Even though the Trojans only played three games there, the “Corvallis Curse” loomed over the program in the weeks leading up to each fateful trip, including this year. The team had heard all about its past struggles on the road against OSU, and instead of ignoring them, quietly embraced them.
“The best part about [the win] was how loud they were when we first started playing,” redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “And then dead silence — all you could hear were our fans cheering.”
Though it was only one win, you get a sense that it was the type of win that could cause a change in the trajectory of the season. What was once viewed as a hopeless season after several low points, including a home loss to Washington State, the firing of Lane Kiffin and a woeful loss at Notre Dame that pushed USC’s record to 4-3, has now turned into a potential resounding success — even by USC standards.
“We’re taking it one game at a time,” Kessler said after the win in standard cliche player-speak. “It’s obviously a big win on the road, and it helps us out in the Pac-12, but we’ve got to stay focused. This is when it gets really tight towards the end of the season.”
Given the overnight shift in attitude and the players’ extreme devotion to Orgeron, the Trojans suddenly have the look of a contender, and with another road game on the horizon against a 1-8 Cal team, it’s easy to envision USC having a 7-3 record when it returns to the Coliseum on Nov. 16 to face Stanford. With a packed Coliseum and a team full of confidence, its well within the realm of possibility for the Trojans to beat the Cardinal for the first time since 2008.
It all comes back to Orgeron, though. Under his no excuses, “One team, one heartbeat” mantra, USC players seem more locked in and dedicated than they have been in a long time.
“Coach O just brings that type of attitude to the team,” Bailey said. “Whatever he tells us to do, we’ll do it. Nobody questions anything he says, because he knows. If anybody knows the way to turn this program around, it’s Coach O, and right now I say he’s got it headed in the right direction.”
That direction appears, at least at the moment, to be trending upward.

Best coach, not best coach…it’s a moot issue.  Given Coach Orgeron’s skills in leading/delegating, not to mention his obvious ability to prep a game, not to mention that voce, try to imagine any other coach out there?  Poor guy!

On the heels of a dominant defensive performance against what was considered to be one of the elite offenses in the Pac-12 at Oregon State, USC redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw has been named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week.
Stepping up · Redshirt junior defensive back Josh Shaw has three interceptions this season while playing both safety and cornerback. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Shaw led the Trojans in the 31-14 dismantling of the Beavers with eight tackles and an interception, continuing his stellar play this season.
He was tasked with shutting down one of the most dynamic receivers in the nation, junior Brandin Cooks, and was extremely effective in that role. Cooks and quarterback Sean Mannion were considered the most feared quarterback-receiver tandem in the nation before Friday’s game, but were not able to muster much against Shaw and the rest of the Trojan defense. The Beavers scored only one offensive touchdown and were unable to find any sort of rhythm.
The Palmdale, Calif. native has been vital in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s revamped system, as his versatility has been utilized since the beginning of the season.
Through the first nine games of this season, Shaw has started at every position in the secondary, being asked to switch from safety to cornerback on a near-weekly basis as injuries have made their way through the Trojan’s depth chart. He has made each transition seamlessly, and has been a crucial player for a much-improved USC defense.
Shaw becomes the second Trojan this season to take home conference player of the week honors. On the season, Shaw has 49 total tackles and three interceptions, which is tied for the team lead.
Redshirt Sophomore punter Kris Albarado was named Pac-12 Special Teams Player of the Week in the fourth week of the season for his performance in the 17-14 win against Utah State.
Junior defensive end George Uko was also nominated for special teams player of the week this week, and redshirt sophomore tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen was nominated for offense. Uko recorded one tackle and blocked an OSU field goal attempt, while Allen rushed for 133 yards and three touchdowns.
The Trojans’ next game is on Saturday against California in Berkeley, Calif. at noon.

After earning perhaps its biggest win of the season last weekend at Oregon State, USC will hit the road again, traveling to Berkeley, Calif. this weekend to face off against the California Golden Bears.
Break away · USC junior wide receiver Marqise Lee’s return on Saturday provided a huge boost to the Trojans’ offense. Lee led the USC attack with five receptions for 105 yards and one receiving touchdown. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The Bears (1-8, 0-6 Pac-12) are coming off a 33-28 loss to Arizona. In that game, Cal quarterback Jared Goff set a single-season record for completions for Cal. Goff is averaging 317.9 passing yards per game, good for 11th in the nation, with 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions.
After a slow start to the season, USC redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler has now thrown for more than 200 yards in the past five games and seems to have finally settled in as the Trojans’ signal caller.
USC (6-3, 3-2 Pac-12) holds a 65-30-5 all-time record against Cal, and has faced off against the Bears more than any other team in the school’s history. The Trojans have defeated the Bears for the past nine seasons.
Cal connections
This weekend will mark the first time USC defensive coordinator and secondary coach Clancy Pendergast will return to Cal since serving as the Bears’ defensive coordinator from 2010 to 2012.
In Pendergast’s first season at Cal, the Bears led the Pac-12 in sacks, and in his second year, they were ranked in the top three in sacks, total tackles and rushing defense.
Since Pendergast left Cal’s coaching staff, the Bears have struggled on the defensive side, sitting last in the Pac-12 in scoring and passing defense, and second-to-last in the nation in total defense, allowing an average of 529.8 yards per game.
USC, on the other hand, has flourished under its new defensive coordinator and his 5-2 system, topping the conference in total defense and ranking 12th in the nation, allowing only 323.0 yards per game.
In last week’s game against Oregon State, Pendergast’s defense held the Beavers to just 369 yards of offense, more than 100 yards lower than the Beavers’ average on the season.
Cal head coach Sonny Dykes is in his first year with the Bears, and though the team has struggled, USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron still respects his style of play.
“He’s had a tremendous career, put a lot of points on the board,” Orgeron said. “Spread offense, hurry up offense — kind of the offenses that have given us problems.”
Orgeron and Dykes have never faced off as head coaches before, but Dykes served as the head coach of Louisiana Tech, located in Orgeron’s home state, from 2010 to 2012.
Back at it
Against the Beavers, junior wide receiver Marqise Lee had his best game of the season so far, hauling in five passes for 105 yards and one touchdown. The 2012 Biletnikoff Award winner had missed two of the previous three games with a knee injury, but returned with style against the Beavers.
“He’s an explosive player, and as a defensive coach, I know you always have to account for him and you have to figure out if you’re gonna single-cover or double-cover him,” Orgeron said of Lee. “Obviously if you double-cover it opens up the run game. If you single-cover him, you better be really good.”
In Lee’s absence, sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor stepped up, hauling in 161 and 97 yards, respectively, in the two games Lee missed.
Though Cal’s defense will be busy defending the pass, USC also hopes to maintain its strong running game.
Senior tailback Silas Redd seems to have found his groove after missing the first five games of the season, pacing USC’s offense with 140 rushing yards last week. His success complements that of redshirt sophomore tailbacks Javorius “Buck” Allen and Tre Madden, who have had breakout seasons. Allen had a career-high three rushing touchdowns in Friday’s win over Oregon State.
Though Madden is questionable for the game at Cal, Orgeron expects Allen to keep contributing.
“He’s the guy that’s getting better every day in our program,” Orgeron said. “He’s gotten bigger, stronger and faster. Give [running backs coach] Tommie Robinson all the credit, who has done a tremendous job of coaching him, and Buck for staying in there for so long and waiting his turn.”
Injury updates
Orgeron said that Madden, redshirt senior offensive tackle Kevin Graf and redshirt junior tight end Xavier Grimble are all questionable to play in Saturday’s game, though he noted their statuses might change given the extra day of rest USC has between games.

For many students at USC, November marks the time to begin applying for that perfect summer internship.
For programmers, a position at Google or Facebook means incredible benefits, stellar connections and rightfully earned bragging rights. Landing a job at one of the Big Four — Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG — as an accounting student is a sign that you’re doing something right. And once you’ve made it to Ogilvy & Mather or Edelman as a public relations professional, the sky’s the limit.
These generalizations, of course, don’t hold for everyone. Startups, for example, are becoming increasingly popular places to intern or work at, appealing to those who enjoy casual clothes and office dogs.
But regardless of whether or not you choose to pursue internships at high-profile companies, getting an internship anywhere requires knowledge of certain guidelines and unspoken rules. Daniel Kyu Lee, founder and CEO of CareerDean, is trying to make the frustrating internship process better understood and easier to navigate with his startup. Emphasizing the importance of having a network when finding internships, CareerDean is a platform that helps match students with companies and provides students with a personalized professional network. In an interview, Lee shared some of his wisdom on how people should be approaching the art of scoring an internship.
Don’t sell yourself short
Though it certainly can be competitive for students to find internships, just remember — the competition is not one-sided. “College recruiting is a very big space, and companies try to find the best talent,” Lee said. “Finding the best interns is also a very lengthy and aggressive process for recruiters as well.” Even if you might not think you can get an interview, apply anyway — you’ll never know if you don’t try.
Do your research
Undoubtedly, career fairs are helpful events for networking and internships, but chances are that not all of the companies you’re interested in will be there. This is because having a booth at an event like this can be very expensive. “Companies that aren’t as big sometimes can’t afford to be represented at these fairs or can’t afford to fly out to Southern California.” If you’re looking to discover more companies that you otherwise might not know about, make the most of LinkedIn by looking up companies you already know and then seeing related companies that other people have viewed. Sites such as AfterCollege and Internships.com have lists of companies that can help get you started with your search.
Dig deep
Sometimes, not all available positions are shown on a company’s job page because either the position isn’t urgently needed or the right people have not caught the attention of recruiters yet. If you’re eagerly waiting to apply to a company, try emailing a recruiter. For direct email addresses, try going to the campus career center and seeing if there is a contact for that company. If not, try adding him or her through LinkedIn or get introduced through a mutual friend or connection.
Start early
Though every industry and company is different, there are definitely patterns when it comes to the internship recruitment period.
“For larger tech companies such as Yahoo! and Google, technical recruiting begins very early — most internship decisions are made by November or December,” Lee said.
Other companies, such as Sony PlayStation, start opening their applications later in the year. On the other hand, startups vary the most in terms of recruitment. Though there are startups that follow the conventional fall application period, some take interns between January and March or even on a rolling basis. But in all cases, it never hurts to be prepared early on.
Luck be a recruiter
Being smart definitely plays a big role in getting internships, but as the playing field continues to change, you also have to be skilled at making connections. Being able to strike up a good conversation, whether in-person or through email, is an art that takes practice to refine. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll be able to tell when you and a recruiter hit it off, and from there, you can follow up respectfully. It doesn’t happen each and every time, but if you make a great connection with someone, you could at least land yourself an interview.
Network, network, network
Because recruiters must go through so many applications and cover letters, it becomes very difficult to stand out, even if you are fantastic applicant.
“Networking is one of the most efficient ways to get a job,” Lee said. “It might seem daunting, but students don’t understand that having a large network plays a big advantage.”
People won’t be able to tell who you are on paper. But by networking with others, they get a better feel of who you are and might approach you with an internship if the opportunity arises. Need some help networking? Lee recommends that you start on LinkedIn and start messaging people.
“Reach out to people and say that you’re seeking mentorship and are interested in learning more about the company culture over some coffee,” Lee said. “You’ll probably get no for an answer 90 percent of the time, but if you message 10 people, you’ll get at least one mentor.”
Use all of your resources
If you feel like you’ve done all that you can to find an internship and are still left empty-handed, all is not lost. Surf through the Tech L.A. Internships website if you’re interested in working at an L.A-based startup or show off your creative side to companies on Intern Sushi. Check the ConnectSC portal frequently, since new positions are always being added. Ask professors and advisers and see if they can help connect you to people in their networks for internship opportunities.
Room for improvement
In the end, if you cannot find an internship, try following up with the rejections and ask how you could make your resume stand out the next time around.  Though rejection is difficult, learning from it will make you a better applicant.

Over the past 15 years, very few artists have attained the level of success that rapper Marshall Mathers, aka Eminem, has reached.

Since bursting onto the hip-hop scene with his Grammy-winning album and alter ego phenomenon The Slim Shady LP in 1999, his career has skyrocketed into superstardom. With more than 80 million albums sold worldwide and headlining music festivals and tours around the world, it is clear that Eminem is one of the most popular artists of this generation.
One of Eminem’s best-selling albums was The Marshall Mathers LP released in 2000, selling 1.76 million copies in the first week and becoming the fastest-selling album ever by a solo artist. More personal than his previous work, MMLP had Eminem discussing the hardships of his life from childhood to his newly found celebrity status while maintaining the comical style of rap that made him popular.
This formula worked extremely well for his early music, and it appears that he is bringing it back for a sequel.
The Marshall Mathers LP 2, his first album since 2010’s Recovery, sees Eminem reaching into the hip-hop archives to create an old-school hip-hop sound that can take listeners back almost 20 years. Much of this can be attributed to legendary hip-hop producer and album collaborator Rick Rubin, who has worked with hip-hop icons such as the Beastie Boys, Run D.M.C. and Jay Z.
Rubin’s influence was immediately evident on the album’s lead single, “Berzerk.” Produced by Rubin, the beat features retro-sounding drums and old-school disc jockey scratches supplemented by rough electric guitar, not to mention samples from the Beastie Boys’ classic hit “Fight For Your Right.” Eminem’s aggressive rapping style complements the hard-hitting beat perfectly, and though the song might not be every listener’s favorite, it sets an interesting tone for much of the album.
Eminem creates one of the more hilarious songs on the album over Rubin’s classic production with the song “Love Game” featuring Compton’s own Kendrick Lamar, the only rapper to make a guest appearance on the album. The beat primarily consists of samples from Wayne Fontana and the Mindbender’s 1965 hit “Game Of Love,” giving it just enough of a hip-hop makeover to bring it to 2013 without losing the essence of the song.
Even with a strong focus on an old-school sound, MMLP2 has its fair share of pop-influenced songs that are very radio-friendly.
“The Monster” brings back Rihanna for another hook that attempts to recreate the success of their smash hit, “Love The Way You Lie.” The song addresses the media and the expectations that are put on them, referred to as the “monster” that they have befriended and tried to get used to. Eminem’s first line explains his frustration very clearly, stating, “I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek / Oh well, guess beggars can’t be choosey.” The song transitions from speaking about his own problems to hoping that his music can positively affect at least one other person’s life, saying, “It’s payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft / Turning nothing into something, still can make that.”
Another song that fits this mold is “Headlights,” which enlists the help of fun. frontman Nate Ruess to sing about the emotional troubles of a single-parent household. Eminem uses this song as somewhat of a reconciliation with his own mother, whom he has represented very negatively — to say the least — in his music for many years. Despite the many horrible things he has said about his mother in the past, he admits that she is still beautiful to him for the sole reason that she is his mom. He even mentions the fact that he does not play the song “Cleaning Out My Closet” at his concerts anymore and he cringes “every time it’s on the radio” because it is so harsh. The song is portrayed as Eminem writing this message to her as the plane he is on is about to crash, bringing his true feelings and emotions to the forefront.
With the album focusing on a wide range of sounds and emotions, a track as simple as Eminem dropping punch line after punch line for six minutes can showcase his lyricism better than anything else. “Rap God” gives us exactly that, with a strong yet simple beat that Eminem proceeds to take over. The highlight of the track, however, is Eminem’s super-fast delivery during the middle of the third verse, with lyrics coming so quickly, that it is hard to keep up, but extremely entertaining to listen to.
Overall, The Marshall Mathers LP 2  is more than simply a sequel to its predecessor. MMLP2 touches on many of the same themes from the previous album, but Eminem expands on them with a much more mature and understanding point of view. He is not the same person he was when he created MMLP, so it is unfair to expect the exact same material. The growth between the two albums is evident, and it really is a delightful journey. Though his anger might be less prevalent in his rapping style throughout the album, the overall range of emotions is very present. Comparing the two albums is difficult, but it is fair to say that Mathers has created a very worthy piece of work to add to his already successful resume.

“Can there be misery loftier than mine?” If the mindset of the average college student during midterm season were to be translated into a play, it would probably end up looking much like the production of Samuel Beckett’s Endgame currently showing at A Noise Within. Set in a dank, drippy basement with two filthy windows and no furniture or cheeriness to speak of, this play is a 90-minute slug through post-apocalyptic depression.
Nonsensical · Endgame explores life in a post-apocalyptic earth. The theater adaptation is hard to follow for those unfamiliar with the script. – Courtesy of A Noise Within
Those unfamiliar with the work of Irish playwright Samuel Beckett might find the dialogue, tone and execution of Endgame to be jarring and borderline incomprehensible. Those brave theatergoers who have experienced his other bleak works, such as the seminal Waiting for Godot, however, will know what they’re in for: long stretches of silence, much repetition, whip-fast exchanges of dialogue and general existential dreariness.
Written in 1957, Endgame focuses on the blind, physically handicapped Hamm and his caretaker (or servant? or slave?) Clov as they try to survive after an unnamed disaster has befallen Earth. Though the state of the world is never explicitly stated, multiple references to the Earth being “dead” and desolate have apocalyptic implications. While post-apocalyptic films today lament the loss of the Internet and weapons of mass destruction, Clov’s chief concern about the world’s end is that there are no bicycles left. In fact, much of Clov’s dialogue reads as though it could easily be uttered by a trendy eco-friendly vegan hippie living in Los Angeles in 2013, marking Beckett as a granddaddy to the save-the-earth trends that would pop up after his death.
No one illuminates the classics with as much vigor and grace as the artists at A Noise Within in Pasadena. As they have demonstrated before, even the dustiest, most lifeless pieces can become beautiful and interesting again. Never has this been more evident than in their production of Endgame. This play is perhaps the most Beckett-y of them all, but this particular production is the most accessible version of Beckett audiences will be lucky enough to see.
To be honest, the success of this production can be mainly attributed to the theater’s setup and thus the proximity of the audience to the actors. Trying to grasp the concept behind Beckett’s work can often be like riding a high-speed train; fall off, and it’s next to impossible to catch up with it. In fact, maybe the train even left the station three minutes before the audience could even board. This is why being able to sit so close to the actors is vital to enjoying Beckett; once the audience is separated by more than about 10 rows or, God forbid, multiple balconies, it becomes much too easy to let the droning dialogue serve as a lullaby.
It follows, then, that the actors deserve special commendation for staying hyper-engaged themselves throughout the piece. The somehow energetically charged boredom performed by Geoff Elliott as Hamm and Jeremy Rabb as Clov saved the play from the brink of tedium many times over. Elliott’s beautiful, resonant speaking voice, moreover, is sure to send tingles up the spine.
The shuffling gait and quasi-hunchback posture adopted by Rabb’s Clov is a major source of comic relief for much of the production until a tonal shift highlights the fact that these are products of his beaten-down spirit. Similarly, the whiny timbre of his voice at first appears to be an attempt at buoying the audience’s depression with a glimmer of silliness, but it’s slowly revealed that all that remains of Clov’s personality is his negativity.
Another source of partial comic relief is Hamm’s set of parents, named Nagg and Nell (portrayed by Mitchell Edmonds and Jill Hill, respectively), who only ever appear from the waist-up because they live in barrels. (Yes, barrels. They don’t call it Theater of the Absurd for nothing.) Occasionally piping up when summoned by their son, Nagg and Nell provide brief glimpses of Beckett’s sense of humor: “At least our hearing hasn’t failed,” Nagg says. “Our what?” Nell says. But, like Clov, Nagg and Nell turn out to be more dark than comedy.
Apart from having a thought-provoking script and compelling performances from all four actors, the only other aspect of the production worth noting is the clever lighting design. Lighting designer Karyn D. Lawrence employed subtle shifts in white lighting to draw the audience’s attention to different parts of the stage, impressively creating the illusion that the set was more than just a one-room basement. Lawrence also made excellent use of the abundance of dust on the stage and in the costumes, casting lights that caught the shimmering clouds of dust in action.
Though Endgame presents a challenge to most people with 21st-century attention spans, the impressive production at A Noise Within offers a cathartic experience to those students experiencing schoolwork-induced existential crises.

On Oct. 17, CNN reported that nearly 30 million people around the world are currently living as slaves. The Global Slavery Index, published by the Australia-based Walk Free Foundation, ranked 162 countries based on three factors that include estimated prevalence of modern slavery, a measure of child marriage and a measure of human trafficking in and out of a country. Though it would be comforting to think that slavery is a relic of history, it remains a scar on humanity on every continent to this day. Recognizing its prevalence is imperative for the advancement of global society.
The survey’s index defines slavery as “the possession and control of a person in such a way as to significantly deprive that person of his or her individual liberty, with the intent of exploiting that person through their use, management, profit, transfer or disposal. Usually this exercise will be achieved through means such as violence or threats of violence, deception and/or coercion.”
Many are trapped in debt bondage to a  local  landowner or born into slavery because of caste, customary, social and hereditary obligations. Bonded labor, whether through debt or other forms of bondage of workers, is rife in stone quarries, brick kilns, construction sites and the mining industry. Sexual exploitation of Indian women, men, transgender people and children, is widespread. Thousands of Indian women are forced into different forms of slavery ranging from domestic service to prostitution. Women, largely from Nepal and Bangladesh, have been identified in situations of commercial sexual exploitation. Non-labor forms of modern slavery, including forced marriage, fraudulent adoption and organ trafficking have also been identified in such countries. More saddening is the fact that child and forced marriage are still prevalent and child protection practices remain weak.
According to the Walk Free Foundation index, there are 29.6 million people in modern slavery globally. India leads the world, followed by China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, Thailand, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Bangladesh. These 10 countries account for 76 percent of the world’s modern slaves. These numbers reflect the chauvinistic nature of the countries.
The solution to this problem lies in awareness and enforcement. Nick Grono, CEO of Walk Free Foundation, believes publicizing this slavery index could help change the prevalence of modern slavery in the world. Widely published numbers carry a lot of weight and can influence public opinion.
The enforcement of laws criminalizing modern slavery is inconsistent, and corruption within law enforcement and government officials contributes to this problem. As a result, national and state-level responses are not benefitting those in slavery as much as they should, due to involvement of local officials and their avoidance of conflict with locally powerful slaveholders and traffickers. Moreover, the justice system can be slow in the countries most affected by slavery. Remedying these problems will create the much-needed change.
Many countries still function on antiquated belief systems that say it is acceptable to enslave others. Though the issue is deep and complicated, the coercion, manipulation, emotional and physical abuse exercised by fellow human beings is a threat to global peace and more must be done in terms of awareness and enforcement to abolish this hateful practice.

In the words of the beloved Bard, “All the world’s a stage.” This statement applies even in the hospital room.
At a glance, theater and medicine seem like wholly different worlds, too contrasting to string into the same sentence. And yet, that same combination is making magic happen at the University of Missouri. And it shouldn’t stop there.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
 
In a series of short plays called Breast Cancer Dialogues, MU is using theater to help doctors and nurses become more responsive to patients’ needs. Not only does the project open up discussion of breast cancer, but it also sheds light on the significance of the humanities in understanding the cultural, social and emotional aspects in medicine.
The series was developed by Heather Carver, an associate professor of playwriting and performance studies at the MU. After battling breast cancer in 2005, she came up with the idea of creating short plays that could, according to the Medical Daily, “somehow make the complexities behind doctor-patient rapport more real to medical students, in order to help train them for real-life situations.” The project incorporates interactive theater to allow the audience to intervene mid-scene, challenging and readjusting the script in a way that makes the doctor more caring toward the patient. The dialogue stems from real-life experiences.
Though the realm of science conjures up images of Frankenstein and test tubes, in the day-to-day duties of a healthcare professional, medicine is not just a science, but an art. The personal bond between patient and physician remains the essence of the profession.
In a paper published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Dr. Alan Dow, conducted a pilot study exploring the effects of using theater to teach clinical empathy. The researchers concluded that collaborative efforts of the departments of theater and medicine are indeed effective, further suggesting the promise of this interdisciplinary approach.
The connection between the stage and the hospital is very real. As the paper pointed out, “During patient encounters, expert clinicians perceive empathy cues from patient and compose verbal and nonverbal responses that are tailor-made to what they observe and hear. Similarly, actors on stage must identify the different vocal tones, body language and degree of emotion expressed by other actors. They then respond, in the moment, with a carefully measured reaction.”
Yet, by no means am I trying to make a blanket statement to say that the humanities and science are actually one area of study. In truth, they harbor many differences — science studies the natural world with a logical, critical eye whereas the humanities focus on the inner world of the self, perception and expression. However those differences are not meant to divide.
Let’s do away with this so-called split between the two titular cultures of science and humanities. Rather, theater and medicine are unified by the common goal of understanding the human condition — just in different ways. They need each other.
As Samuel H. Golter, founder of City of Hope National Medical Center, once said, “There is no profit in curing the body, if in the process, we destroy the soul.” In other words, a cure is nothing without compassion, a central lesson in the Breast Cancer Dialogues. MU isn’t the first to merge medicine with theater, and it shouldn’t be the last.
