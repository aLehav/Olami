Action blockbusters have habitually ruled the box office summer in and summer out, but The Avengers, The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises weren’t the only films on moviegoers’ minds these past few months.

In fact, many of this summer’s independent films did surprisingly well at the box office and were welcomed with warm, critical praise.
Mike Birbiglia’s Sleepwalk with Me — with its positive reviews and an impressive opening weekend accented by a take of $65, 000 on a single screen at IFC Center in New York City — is just another example of independent films challenging the indie stereotype.  Typically confined to critical praise but little popular recognition, as with 2008’s The Hurt Locker, today’s indies ask  the question as to whether these films are becoming a bigger part of mainstream cinematic culture.
The answer isn’t clear-cut, but independent films have increasingly drawn more and more attention from filmgoers, suggesting they are now taking a more prominent role in popular cinema.
The shift in viewing patterns comes in large part from the industry itself.  Whether it’s from a passion project or simply a change of pace, popular actors are making the jump from bigger, box-office hungry productions to smaller, independent films. These big names, in turn, lay the foundation for a larger box-office draw or at the very least generate a greater awareness surrounding the films.
Many of this summer’s indie smashes fall into that big fish, small pond scenario.  Famed comedian Chris Rock starred in 2 Days in New York. Notable television actress Rashida Jones and Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg spearheaded Celeste & Jesse Forever and some of Great Britain’s finest actors — cue Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith — lined up to star in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
True, the success of a film cannot be measured based on the merit of its actors alone.  But, by incorporating well-known stars in independent films, the mainstream appeal increases tenfold, creating the framework for a financially successful film overall.
Still, it’s not really the big-name actors that challenge the notion that independent films are restricted to small budgets, unknown actors and little popular recognition on their own.  Instead, domestic box-office grosses speak for the newfound mainstream appeal of indie films themselves.
For this summer’s standout independent films, Hotel and Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom stand out as popular and financially successful frontrunners.  Both took a slow but steady approach, and it paid off.  The former received positive reviews and raked in a whopping $45.8 million domestically — middle- age moviegoers needed some alternative to The Avengers, after all — while the latter was hailed as one of Anderson’s best works and collected $43.5 million in the United States.
Then there’s Woody Allen, the prodigal indie director, actor and screenwriter.  At $15.9 million in the box office, this summer’s To Rome With Love failed to rival the success of last summer’s Midnight in Paris — arguably his most popular and by far his most lucrative film, raking in $56.8 million domestically.  And yet, by proving to be a hit maker, Allen’s overall commercially and critically successful body of work defies the archetypal expectation of independent filmmaking.
Of course not all indie films did so well in terms of profits. Critics nearly unanimously reviewed Beasts of the Southern Wild as one of the best films of the year, and though it grossed $8.9 million — good by the standards of a film this small — it wasn’t nearly on the same financial success level as Hotel or Kingdom.  Ruby Sparks and Safety Not Guaranteed, in contrast, had higher revenue expectations, but failed to impress, as neither managed to breach $4 million.
It should be noted, however, that as with any genre, there will be hits and misses.  Beasts will likely be a formidable Oscar contender, even though its box office was good but  not great. Alternately, The Amazing Spider-Man’s box office performance was, well, amazing at $258.4 million, but it will likely receive little critical recognition beyond effects come award season.
Hits and misses aside, there has been an overall growth spurt in the popularity of independent films.  Go to Landmark or Arclight and see for yourself — The Dark Knight Rises played alongside Ruby Sparks, and The Avengers shared a theater with Hotel.
Independent films are becoming a more prominent part of our cinematic culture, and though they will not push blockbusters to the sidelines anytime soon, they are certainly making a name for themselves financially and popularly.
And if the transition of well-known actors to smaller films, or the unexpected box-office successes of many of this summer’s indie darlings is any indication, then there just might be a larger, integral role for independent cinema within mainstream culture.

When it’s time to go back to school — to leave behind summer jobs and endless weekends — a student’s first thought isn’t “What books do I need for class?” It’s “What do I wear?”
Student wants to look their best on campus. You never know if you’ll run into someone you want to impress or whether you’ll have a last-minute interview. Here’s a guide to dressing in style no matter the occasion.
Every autumn brings back the East Coast vibe of trim-cut coats and thick scarves, but here in sun-soaked Los Angeles, these styles must be adapted for beach weather. This fall’s trends are an amalgam of various decades: retro rockabilly, grunge that’s flashy-yet-classy and, of course, prep school minus the geek factor.
If there’s one material that’s on every student’s radar, it’s denim. No longer deemed an ironic throwback to the ’90s, it’s now used as a legitimate base for shirts, jackets and other outerwear.
Bold, eye-catching patterns are another trend. Does it make your head spin and your eyes strain? Go for it! Don’t be afraid to mix and match either, because it is très chic to throw together contrasting designs and colors — within reason, of course.
Best of all, our warmer climate allows for more laid-back, less- stuffy styles than other states, which makes for a playful transition into the harsh winter months of Los Angeles.
“L.A. fall fashion is very different than the average fall fashion,” junior Kate Lindemann, a psychology major and style guru from CollegeFashionista.com, said. “Many summer styles can be used in fall since it is hard to wear large coats and lots of knitwear at sunny USC.”
Similarly, pants no longer adhere to the standard black or denim mold. It’s all about bright colors, floral prints and paint splatters. Color trends for women point toward turquoise, burnt orange, pastels and also the use of peach as a neutral. Neon is also gaining popularity in shades that are softer and more understated than their rave-happy counterparts.
Dresses with cutout waists and short skirts with trains are also appearing on the streets; ladies can show off some skin while still staying classy. Lace dresses, which have gained popularity, will be conservatively cut but daring in color and print. When the occasion calls for something professional, tux pants look sophisticated — pair these with some printed pumps and you’re ready for the office.
For men, camel and burgundy seem to be on many designers’ radars, as well as navy-noir, an alternative to traditional black. Summer 2012 was the season of the vintage Hawaiian print, but this fall will herald the arrival of varsity jackets and ’70s-esque florals. On a more formal level, deconstructed jackets are a great way for men to look like they mean business while staying comfortable.
Speaking of outerwear, dressing warmly is a tricky topic in Los Angeles. The temperature definitely doesn’t drop it like it’s hot, but there are those rare days of rain and overcast skies that justify heavier clothes. Colder days this fall will call for graphic print and tie-dye sweaters, tweed coats and, of course, leather jackets.
For the fashion impaired, knowing what to buy, where to buy it, and how to assemble a look might seem overwhelming. Fortunately, there are plenty of style savvy Trojans here to help.
New onto the scene is Sophie Elkus [at right], a junior public relations major whose Angel Food Style blog keeps readers up-to-date on the latest trends in couture.
Perfect for USC students who have a passion for fashion, Elkus’ style catalogue reports on the latest in luxury brands and seasonal fads. Her blog incorporates elements from higher-end stores like LF with what Elkus describes as the casual “beach culture influence that creates a vibe not many other schools have.”
A website called VCuffs.com — founded and operated by recent USC alumnus Jay Roth — caters to the style-savvy man. Suits and other business attire are often best left simple and classic for the most office-appropriate look, but it’s never a bad idea to let accents show a bit of your personality.
At VCuffs, men can purchase custom-designed accessories that are, as Roth explains, “a statement and staple for any man, whether in the board room or out on the town.” Roth’s line of VCuffs, VTieClips and VSuspenders are available online and also at the USC bookstore; the V stands for Victory — fitting given his successful debut.
Once the sunny glow of summer fades, this fall promises more colors and patterns than the leaves on the trees. Don’t be afraid to make daring clothing choices because autumn is, after all, the season of change.

With more focused diet trends and Top Chef captivating viewers’ interests and palate, students are more informed about food than ever. USC Hospitality Chef Eric Ernest is aware of this fact and, with freshness and quality in mind, has spent the summer implementing changes to menus campus-wide.
Heating up · Chef Eric Ernest spearheaded the welcome changes to the USC dining scene. Students can now enjoy high-quality meals at Café 84, a fully functioning Starbucks at the old Trojan Grounds and a brand new Mongolian grill at EVK Restaurant and Grill. – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
 
Q: As head chef, what is the biggest change students really need to be prepared for?
A: The overall programming is different. Café 84 used to be a food court and is now residential. You’ll no longer be able to go in and just buy a candy bar, now it’s kind of all-or-nothing. [At] EVK, 95 percent of all the fried food is gone. Where we used to have fried chicken, now it will be oven-fried chicken. We’ll quickly fry it to give it that effect, but we’ll let it finish in the oven.
 
Q: In focusing on trying to make the menus more healthy, are more local ingredients being incorporated, and are the seasons of certain foods going to affect them more?
A: Yes, we’ve added a lot of fresh, local, seasonal vegetables as well as seafood dishes.
 
Q: Are there any new seafood dishes that you’re especially excited about?
A: I would say the miso salmon with crispy ginger, I’m pretty excited about that.
 
Q: It sounds like you’re trying to cater not only to different diet trends, but also to the different ethnicities and tastes of the student body.
A: Ten years ago if you had “regional Asian dishes” they may not have even tried them or enjoyed them, but now it’s almost the expectation. We also have added a lot of Asian dishes and different regional dishes — Filipino, Hawaiian, Chinese, Thai, Indian — all the different ethnicities that make up “Asian food.” In the past it was almost like this blanket statement that we have “Asian food,” but it was de facto Chinese food.
 
Q: So of all these changes that we’ve talked about, which are you most excited to implement?
A: Probably the EVK Mongolian Grill. You take your fresh vegetables and homemade sauce, whether it be Chinese vegetables with a kung pow sauce, or rice or noodles or high-quality meats, and you stir fry them very quickly on this Mongolian grill. It’s so fresh and it’s done so fast, right in front of you, so you can see the integrity of the food is really there and is upheld.
 
Q: Is there anything else, campus-wide, that’s also changing?
A: Our big things this semester are the residential remodel, getting rid of the fried food, opening up Trojan Grounds as a Starbucks, opening up Traditions for lunch, and the Grub Line. Overall we’ve tried to balance all of that together.
 
Q: What kind of items are going to be featured in the Grub Line?
A: [The Grub Line] is a grab-and-go line in all our retail units. It’s all handmade, high quality but value-priced. It’s going to be everything from a vegan BBQ tofu sandwich, to a chicken pesto sandwich, chef salads, caesar salads. All really high quality, fresh-made, but value-priced. If you don’t have time, you’re on deadline or in the lab, you can go in and pick up the Grub Line and it’s all made with eco-friendly containers.
 
Q: It seems like you guys have considered every perspective of diet, taste, and expense, which is so important when dealing with so many people.
A: Especially adding Starbucks and the Grub Line, even the residential facilities, things are within price points and there’s a really good value. We’ve had to really focus on value. You go to EVK, pay $10 for lunch and have fresh grilled salmon.
 
Q: You definitely wouldn’t get that kind of meal off-campus for that price.
A: I know! I mean, fresh grilled salmon, fresh salad bars, waffle and crepe bars, you just wouldn’t get that. There’s nowhere on the planet that you’d get that price.
[…] In the past it was almost like this blanket statement that we have “Asian … Read more on Daily Trojan Online     chef, dining, fall, gives, Head, Inside, […]

Though electronically tinged pop has been gaining in popularity in the past few years, only a select few artists have been pushed into the limelight.
Headliners like Avicii and Skrillex have turned heads and dominated at festivals like Hard, which has exploded in size over the years. Electronic dance music has never been bigger, and it doesn’t seem to be going away.
Thankfully, the new contemporary-electronic umbrella hasn’t killed one of the genre’s older talents, as Matthew Dear continues to make some of the most fun albums around.  His latest, Beams, is a funky dancer of an album that features a few bright stars carrying a few more dim ones.
The lead single and first track “Her Fantasy” sparkles from start to finish.  If there were ever a song to set high expectations for a release, this would be it.  Every beat sizzles with pleasure as his voice speak-sings an infectious melody on a beat so good you just have to boogie.  The track is pure fun, and though it runs more than six minutes long, it could easily keep going.
From start to finish, “Her Fantasy” bounces with a joyous energy and has had people dancing along for weeks leading up to the release of the full-length.
“Earthforms” displays another new mode for Dear.  An addictive bassline pulsates the first half of what seems to be a normal disco track before entering Dear’s Brooklyn sound circa 2002.  It’s another change from his usual style, and both tracks feel strangely out of place on the album.  To hear him explore new grounds is always fun — and more so when the bassline is this hypnotizing — but sadly the rest of the album doesn’t live up to the high standards set in these first two tracks: They descend more into his usual fare. (Not that this is a bad thing: Dear’s standout previous release Black City, where he forged this formula was one of the unappreciated gems of 2010).
With “Headcage,” the album shifts back into usual Dear gear.  The strangely danceable song thuds along and vocals in Dear’s sing-song voice lulls you into a trance.
No matter how repetitive Dear’s musical trademark becomes, “Fighting is Futile” and “Up & Out” prove this mood worthwhile, forming a streak of five hot hits to open the album.  “Futile” features steel drums clinking on top of a rippling madness, before a serenely ringing riff carries the song through the fadeout. “Up” has a dirty funk bassline to follow Dear’s hypnotizing drone.
This is where Dear gets a bit too comfortable; the middle section is a triple-play in the middle of a rally.  It manages to not only kill, but brutally destroy the considerable momentum heading into it.  “Overtime,” wub-wubbing enough to make you cringe, is an awful track.  It could easily be mistaken for a bad dubstep remix until picking up the pace two-thirds of the way through before Dear chants “fade out” through the song’s fade-out.
“Get the Rhyme Right” doesn’t pick up the pace much, sounding like Spoon on synthesizers, and “Ahead of Myself” sounds like Dear doing his best Joe Goddard impression.
Even with the clear creative influences, these songs feel a bit too familiar — that is to say, not particularly good or interesting.  “Get the Rhyme Right” still works off of the same sort of bass riff as the earlier tracks, and though “Ahead of Myself” has the bells and whistles of newer Hot Chip singles, it follows the same musical undercurrents as the rest of the album.
Though it might just be fatigue from hearing him go back to the same well so many times at this point in the album, neither track is particularly enthralling.  This middle third of the album drags; you can’t help but think that this might be a place Dear treads a bit too often.  Further variations on the same theme would be appreciated over expounding upon the same style endlessly.
Though Dear doesn’t deviate from this echoing, he does do it in a more interesting manner.  “Do the Right Thing” doesn’t represent a shift in the style as much as it does it better than the rest. You have to bounce as Dear half-whines, half-groans his way over funk and buzz.  His voice provides the beat through a variety of dum’s and bum-chika-bum’s looping through the background, juxtaposing beautifully with the drone of the song.
“Shake Me” proves a rainy distraction on the way to another standout at the back-end, “Temptation.”  Strangely enough, it echoes “Her Fantasy,” and maybe because he never reached that same level of greatness during the album, “Temptation” seems like a challenger for the crown as best track on the record.
The breakdown and Dear’s slurred chants about his “insides fall[ing] to pieces” provide a fitting coda to what’s ultimately a broken record.

Students reacted to news that a Los Angeles city committee decided to delay a vote on approving a plan to renovate the University Village until November and schedule a hearing on Sept. 18. Dozens of public comments raised concerns over the effect that the development would have on the community and current shop owners and certain budget allocations.
Master Plan · The large-scale project will include a housing complex, retail shops and a grocery store at the University Village. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The city’s Planning, Land Use and Management Committee postponed the vote on Aug. 21 to give more time for city planners to investigate concerns raised at the meeting, which ranged from a possible budget underestimate for the construction of bike lanes to inadequate measures to ensure jobs in the new center are filled by local residents.
Austin Coleman, a senior majoring in psychology and political science, said it is very important that the community is involved with the project.
“I’m glad they’re taking the community into consideration,” Coleman said. “We all agree the University Village needs to look better, but we need to work with the community to decide what should be a part of it.”
The renovations will replace the University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century Apartments with a housing complex and shopping center, which would include a grocery store.
“When you think about it, it sounds awesome,” Coleman said. “But I think we’re forgetting about the people we share the neighborhood with. We’re in their neighborhood. We’re taking it away from them.”
Junior critical studies major Kiki Hallebo said the Village would benefit students but is unsure whether the renovations will benefit the community.
“It will bring in more jobs, but who are you actually giving jobs to?” she said.
About 70 people, fairly equally divided between supporting and opposing the plan, spoke over the course of 2 1/2 hours at the PLUM hearing. Those commenting included other councilmembers, local business owners, USC employees, nearby residents, employees, community priests, public interest groups, students and professors.
“USC wants the right to service the city,” said Councilmember José Huizar, PLUM vice chair. “This issue is that a project of a magnitude this size, people will expect more certainty in this process … we need more certainty.”
The additional time is partially the result of having fewer people to analyze the documents submitted by USC, several presenters said, after the department was downsized due to budget cuts. The Sept. 18 presentation could result in a vote, but Councilmember and PLUM Chair Ed Reyes said a November vote seems likely, and the presentation would give the project “more urgency.”
Craig Bunn, a senior majoring in English, said he hopes the committee continues to consider community input as they move forward with the vote.
“There’s no question that it’ll change the existing community, for the better of the students but not necessarily the better of the people living there,” he said. “It’s kind of unfortunate that they don’t have as much of a say.”
Wait a minute! The University Village will not be built with public funds!
This is a  private  development – that will provide- something that the local
community needs  jobs, jobs and more jobs!
anonymous… oh how wrong you are.  
Shame on you for jumping to conclusions as I am neither typical or snotty.  Privileged?  Yes, I’ve worked since I was 16 to earn every penny I have.  I am not a USC student, I am a 51-year-old female commercial designer, northern California business owner who yes, has traveled extensively through work and pleasure.  Our son is a student-athlete at USC and our daughter is being recruited.   I have spent much of my life improving interiors so that people can live more comfortably and with beauty.  And I can tell you that updating this center will rise all boats… it will create jobs, look more beautiful, ease traffic with better flow, be safer with improved lighting and become a jewel instead of an eye-sore.  What could be wrong, in any way, with that.
This is not about community input, this is ONLY ABOUT MONEY. The community is simply blackmailing USC in order to get more free housing. Low income housing is the Governments responsibility, not USCs.
The article says we are taking away from the community–what are we taking away? The scholorships, the thousands of hours of voluteering, the millions of dollars in donations every year, the free summer camps, the free schooling, the security, the commerce we bring, etc…. Take USC out of the community and what do you have–not pretty.
It is ludicrous to think that this developmetn hurts anyone and I have yet to hear one real sustainable argument to the contrary.  This really is just a smoke screen to stick us up.
Shame on these leaders for doing this. This development is everything they have been asking for: Jobs, jobs, and more jobs–that’s what USC can give to the communtiy–although we all ready are the largest private employer in LA. Use your brains not your bleeding hearts.
USC, time to get the checkbook out.
Locals have had 60+ years to develop this community, if you look around are there are any instances where they have succeeded? Long term there is no doubt that this new University Village plan will both provide thousands more temporary and permanent jobs for locals and also provide housing and retail for students that are sorely lacking in the area. And will also replace that dumb we call the UV. This is a no-brainer to me.
“…that dumb we call the UV” LOL Trojans at their finest.
You’re not even going to be at USC once this project is completed.
People seem to forget USC has been in the neighborhood long before it was a neighborhood. Homes were developed and people moved in because of the university. Having the current residents complain about the university is analogous to people moving next to an airport and complaining about the noise and demanding change. Nevertheless, USC had continued to embrace the folks that decided to move to the neighborhood through jobs, access to education, and a catalyst for improvements to a crumbling neighborhood. Yet, these relative newcomers continue to demand more and more. The real issue here is not USC, but the developers that bought houses and converted them to housing for students (squeezing out local residents), along with the City Council that did nothing to stop it.
Let’s get this project moving forward.  The University shopping center is an embarrassment of poor construction, difficult pedestrian and vehicle access and weak retail.  Common sense would tell us that improving this area automatically adds jobs to the community… both in construction and retail.   And I don’t understand the concerns that the jobs may not be “local.”  If the local residents are qualified, there is no reason they won’t fill most if not all of the positions as they do now.   I am so tired of people in our country thinking stagnation is somehow a better choice than progession.  Have any of you been out of our country lately?  Canada, Germany, England, France, Sweden, Singapore, and others are whizzing by our country in the development of downtown areas creating vibrant, safe, pedestrian-friendly, beautiful shopping and open space areas… while our country continues to fall into further disrepair.  They would laugh at our ridiculous view that some residents don’t want money brought into their communities for the improvement of all…
“If the local residents are qualified, there is no reason they won’t fill most if not all of the positions as they do now.”
“Have any of you been out of our country lately?”
Typical, snotty, privileged USC kid remarks.  No wonder the community hates us.
There is nothing snotty about Thinker’s remarks.  Locals are employed at the current shops at the UV.  Why does anyone think that labor will be imported from somewhere else to fill the same retail jobs in a nicer looking store?
I can see the perspective that visiting the countries listed could be considered “privileged.”  It could also be a result of military deployment.  Or just a trip with Google Street View.
If the community hates us, it is because we don’t provide for all of their needs.  We are not obligated to do so.
Let’s be real–Trader Joe’s doesn’t hire the same people as El Superior, The Magic Printshop doesn’t hire the same people as Urban Outfitters, etc etc
“I can see the perspective that visiting the countries listed could be considered “privileged.” It could also be a result of military deployment. Or just a trip with Google Street View.”  -___- Yeah, people who live in the area and work their butts off to make ends meet are surely browsing Google Street View to check out the sights of downtown areas in Singapore and Canada. Please.

Barr Benyamin began discussing politics with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with his father at a young age. His interest in the election process was cemented with the Bush-Gore race of 2000. Now, a senior majoring in political science and business administration, Benyamin has spent his summer interning with the Republican National Committee.

“I’ve been very passionate about politics for a long time. I’ve considered it as a career for a while,” Benyamin said. “I feel like this summer really affirmed it in my mind. I find it fascinating. Work is never boring. I feel like I have a purpose. I’m working toward something productive rather than just working.”
This summer, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics paired at least 30 USC students, including Benyamin, with internships to give them hands-on experience with politics, according to Arthur Auerbach, internship coordinator for “Directed Governmental and Political Leadership Internship” (POSC 395). The course is designed to mix practical experience students receive from their internships with professional skills, such as how to interview and craft resumes.
“The one thing I push with students is that they really need to distinguish themselves from other students in terms of taking the next step post-graduation,” Auerbach said. “The main thing is to gain some real-life work experience so they have a better sense of what they want to do after they graduate.”
Aaron Taxy, a junior majoring in international relations, began interning with Congressman Howard Berman’s (D) re-election campaign in January. He said his time with the campaign so far has already given him valuable experience, including working on senior outreach before the June primaries, doing research and staffing events.
“Since I’ve been on the campaign since January, they’ve definitely given me a really good amount of responsibility,” Taxy said. “They generally like to give interns greater responsibilities because they’re there more frequently than volunteers.”
Benyamin worked primarily on web advertisements, doing everything from research to video editing, he said.
“I’ve really learned a lot. Anyone that tells you that they haven’t is lying,” Benyamin said. “I’ve learned running a political campaign is a lot more intricate and difficult than it looks. You have hundreds of people behind the scenes doing things that you never even think about.”
Both Taxy and Benyamin said their internship experiences have given them an understanding of politics that cannot be achieved simply by taking political science courses.
“You can read the news, you can watch the pundit analyze and analyze,” Taxy said. “Only when you’re there, in the moment, can you understand how the internal operation works and just how every piece matters and the success of the election comes down to every single person doing their jobs.”
Alex Yebri, a senior majoring in political science, had planned to spend his summer studying for the LSAT when he was offered a position with Mitt Romney’s campaign in Boston. He decided to push back his LSAT plans and to take an internship with the communications team, where he organized press briefings and was a main contact on the press line.
“I was going to put politics on the back burner and focus on studying for the LSATs, but when you get an opportunity like this, you can’t pass it up,” Yebri said. “After a couple days of deliberating, I had to say yes.”
Taxy plans to continue interning part-time with Congressman Berman through the election to see the campaign all the way to the end.
Though he said he does not know what he plans to do after graduating, this internship has provided him with skills and experience to help him in the future.
“I don’t know what kind of political job would best suit me, but I’m loving it. I love reaching out to the community. I love the intellectual aspect of policy-making,” Taxy said. “Even if I don’t go into politics after school, this experience will be unbelievably valuable to my future.”
Yebri said he still plans to pursue a career in law but has not entirely ruled out continuing to work in politics after his experience with Romney’s campaign.
“Working on a campaign is one of the must fulfilling things because, in the end, you feel like you really made a difference and helped a cause greater than yourself,” he said. “Whether it’s a career or something in your free time, I think you’ll get something out of it greater than any other profession.”
An Excellent well written article.
We Trojans definitely have an advantage.

Following the success of last semester’s trial, Undergraduate Student Government and The New York Times will work together once again to provide free copies of the newspaper to students.
The university will receive 3,000 copies a day for 40 delivery days starting Monday. The papers will be delivered Monday through Friday and distributed at various sites around campus.
Unique to this trial, the readership program will also include a digital “Group Pass” for students, allowing 300 users to obtain 24-hour unlimited access to nytimes.com, the NYTimes smartphone application and the NYTimes Election 2012 application.
After assessing the popularity of the program last semester, The New York Times and USG have decided to fund the second trial together, USG Academic Director Andres Guarnizo said.
“Evaluating the performance last semester, it did really well,” Guarnizo said. “There wasn’t a day where the papers weren’t flying off of the stands, so [USG] met again with The New York Times, and they offered us a deal where they would pay for half of the trial.”
The trial will help USG assess the costs and benefits of the program, USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad said.
“Having The New York Times paper on campus is an overall USC improvement we want to make in terms of making the world media accessible to students on a daily basis,” Prasad said. “It’s just a question of how much does it cost, what’s the benefit, and does the value of the program make sense based on its cost.”
The goal of the program is to have administrators see the value of having the newspapers on campus and ultimately to fund the program, Guarnizo said.
“This semester, the goal is more specific as far as talking to administrators about this program and getting funding for that,” Guarnizo said. “Keeping [the program] one more semester would open up the possibility to talk to deans of schools and administration within USC to see if it’s something they can fund going forward.”
Diana Chung, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said The New York Times is worth the cost in order to encourage students to become more aware.
“The New York Times is one of the best sources for world and national news,” Chung said. “Sometimes at USC or any college, students live in a bubble and are unaware, but being at an higher education institution, USC should provide the means for us to have access to what’s going on outside of campus.”
If the university is able to provide more newspapers on campus, it might enable students to become more involved in world events, said Karthik Vasan, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences and popular music studies.
“People don’t give our age group enough credit for being involved and interested in what’s going on,” Vasan said. “We want to be, but we aren’t given the opportunity to do it. If there are more The New York Times on campus, even if it’s in print and a bit old school, I’m sure people would read it. It would make us more informed, and it would definitely be useful.”
 
Who is paying for all of these print publications? They should work on making the DT readable before adding more waste people ignore.

A  roundtable of reporters and experts discussed Tuesday the ways in which local journalism can increase civic engagement, the subject of a new initiative from the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism.
Roundtable · Panelists discussed the multilingual Alhambra Source news site, part of an Annenberg initiative to increase community engagement through hyper-local journalism at an event Tuesday. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
 
The panel included School of Journalism Director Geneva Overholser, Alhambra Source Editor Daniela Gerson and representatives from Annenberg’s local online news projects Alhambra Source, Intersections South L.A and Metamorphosis Project. The three projects aim to improve community engagement through journalism.
Overholser said the new Civic Engagement and Journalism Initiative works to merge scholarship from Annenberg with the skills introduced in the journalism major together to investigate how to create local news that promotes civic engagement in diverse communities.
“Journalism is right now figuring out how best to help people engage in the life of the community, and that’s what this initiative focuses on,” Overholser said. “It’s particularly exciting — and unique, really — that we can bring the talents of scholarly researchers and journalism professional together.”
Gerson said Annenberg’s scholarly research into increasing community involvement through journalism is unique.
“There’s a proliferation of hyper local news sites across the country, most of which would like to increase civic engagement,” Gerson said. “But few, if any, are engaged in research about how to make that happen.”
Launched in 2010, Alhambra Source is a multilingual local news source that is part of a joint research project at USC Annenberg’s Communication School’s Metamorphosis Project and the School of Journalism. The online publication is entirely composed of writing from more than 30 community contributors who submit first-person stories and serve as “natural translators” to their predominately Asian and Latino suburban community.
The Alhambra Source is published in English, Chinese and Spanish, making the site accessible to the vast majority of the community.
Esmee Xavier, an Alhambra Source contributor, said providing information to the community is an invaluable service.
“If it weren’t for the Source, there would be no easily accessible source of news in Alhambra,” Xavier said. “Most people didn’t even know there were City Council member elections.”
Prior to launching Alhambra Source, the Western San Gabriel Valley, which includes Alhambra, ranked as having the lowest sense of belonging out of six neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area, according to the Metamorphosis project, which studies urban communities. Civic participation was at an all-time low with the 2010 municipal elections being canceled when no candidate challenged any of the five incumbents up for re-election.
Joanna Wu, a 2007 Annenberg graduate and a member of the Alhambra community, said the news outlet helped reverse the lack of civic engagement.
“Just knowing that Alhambra Source is there makes you more interested in the city, it makes you more proud of it,” Wu said. “With other news sources like Patch, sometimes they just grab news from wherever. But with Alhambra Source, there’s an editor who is researching the news, editing it, checking for accuracy — it is journalism at work.”
Xavier also said the Alhambra Source is important for local communities since it provides unbiased analysis rather than advocacy.
“The local paper is by the Chamber of Commerce, and they don’t really cover the stories that open people’s eyes to issue that are actually happening,” Xavier said.

In an example of his patented wry sense of humor, USC coach Lane Kiffin told redshirt freshman Max Wittek on Tuesday that senior walk-on John Manoogian had topped him for the backup quarterback role.
Next in line · Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek will be senior Matt Barkley’s backup in 2012. He has yet to throw a collegiate pass. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
But Kiffin soon relented and told Wittek he was officially naming him senior Matt Barkley’s backup for the season, beating out fellow redshirt freshman Cody Kessler.
“I’m excited about the opportunity,” Wittek said. “I have to stay ready every game, stay ready every play. I have to take advantage of my opportunities when they come.”
He and Kessler have competed for the designation since enrolling in the spring of 2011. Last season, Kiffin redshirted both players, not wanting to burn a year of their eligibility.
Though Kessler was named Barkley’s official backup on the depth chart in 2011, he would have only played had Barkley suffered a serious injury.
Since losing the battle to Kessler, Wittek has improved his understanding of the offense and is reacting much quicker to developments on the field.
Though the new quarterback depth chart adds more clarity to who will take more offensive snaps during practice and enter first in the event of an injury or blowout, Kiffin insists the competition to succeed Barkley will reset once the season ends.
“We feel really confident about both guys,” Kiffin said. “Really, there isn’t much difference between them. This will have nothing to do with who is the starter next season.”
Kiffin hopes that some games this season will allow USC to play both Wittek and Kessler but recognizes such a hope might be unrealistic.
Kiffin also clarified questions related to scholarship numbers Tuesday, noting that USC has renewed scholarships for former walk-ons and redshirt seniors, center Abe Markowitz and linebacker Tony Burnett. Currently, redshirt junior Will Andrew, a former walk-on who earned a scholarship before last season, has yet to have his renewed.
But the situation is fluid, as USC awaits word from the NCAA as to whether incoming freshman receiver Darreus Rogers qualifies academically to play. If he is cleared, he will bring USC to the 75 scholarship limit. If not, Andrew might reclaim his scholarship.
In another competitive position battle, Kiffin has yet to identify a third wide receiver to play behind junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee.
“We have different personnel, different guys playing,” Kiffin said. “Hopefully, we get them all to play, and maybe somebody outperforms the other ones. I would anticipate them all playing [against Hawai’i].”
Based on the depth charts released Monday, the three primary candidates for the third spot are junior De’Von Fluornoy, sophomore George Farmer and freshman Nelson Agholor.

Hawai’i knows that when it enters the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, the steady stream of boos from the sold-out crowd will be the least of the team’s worries.
USC is favored by close to 40 points with a potent offense capable of decimating an inexperienced Warriors squad. This isn’t the same Hawai’i of years past — there are no Heisman Trophy candidates like Timmy Chang  or Colt Brennan  capable of matching up against a BCS behemoth like USC.
Perhaps the Warriors’ lone hope for pulling off a colossal upset comes from their new head coach, a man who intimately knows the ins and outs of USC.
Norm Chow has been in college football for a very long time — 39 years to be exact. From 1973 to 1999 he served in various capacities at BYU, and eventually took over as the lead play-caller in the early 1980s, where he won a national title in 1984.
By the time Chow was named offensive coordinator at USC in 2001, his reputation as an offensive architect was well established. After capturing two AP national championships, Chow had forever cemented his place in Trojan history and everyone thought he had finally earned a head coaching job elsewhere.
Instead, he was snubbed by Stanford after interviewing for its coaching vacancy in 2005, which led him to accept an offensive coordinator position for the Tennessee Titans, where he was fired after the 2007 season.
He later went to Westwood to assume the offensive coordinator position with UCLA but faltered under the Rick Neuheisel regime. Though he built his reputation on developing quarterbacks, Chow was dealt a bad hand at UCLA, with the Bruins’ most talented quarterbacks regularly being sidelined with injuries during his tenure. Eventually, the Bruins negotiated a buyout of the final two years of his contract, paying him $1 million to coach somewhere else.
Chow then went to Utah in 2011 where an early-season injury to veteran quarterback Jordan Wynn severely hampered his offense’s capabilities. He then took the Hawai’i job for 2012.
His coaching career has been underwhelming since his glorious days at USC, and truthfully, that shouldn’t come as a surprise.
Norm Chow’s arrival at USC in 2001 couldn’t have come at a better time. Rising junior quarterback Carson Palmer had struggled for the last two seasons, and Chow’s new pro-style system helped Palmer reach his stride. The Trojans finished their 2002 season with an 11-2 record, and Chow certainly deserves recognition for his contributions.
But while Chow helped Palmer grow into a polished pro prospect, the future Bengal’s undeniable talent was bound to show on the field at one point or another.
Following Palmer’s graduation, Matt Leinart, another future first round pick and Heisman Trophy winner, took over. USC’s 2003 squad featured seven offensive players who would end up being selected in the first two rounds of the NFL draft, a reflection of the unusually high talent Chow had at his disposal.
By the time he had left the college ranks for a coaching stint in the NFL, Chow had worked with six quarterbacks who ended up being first-round selections. Depending on your perspective, that can point to Chow’s ability to maximize the talent around him or reinforce the idea that he was in the right place at the right time.
In truth, it’s probably a little bit of both, but his unsuccessful gigs after USC seem to suggest more of the latter. Case in point: The Tennessee Titans had a grand total of nine passing touchdowns in 2007, the year he was fired from the team despite a 10-6 record overall.
This isn’t about kicking Chow when he’s down. His accolades are no doubt impressive, and the hiring at Hawai’i makes sense when considering his hometown of Honolulu and the program’s desire to move away from the run ‘n’ shoot offense to something more traditional.
Chow won’t turn Hawai’i into a recruiting powerhouse, but he will attract attention from high school prospects because of the quarterbacks he helped blossom  into NFL players. And he has started an important legacy, serving as the first Asian American head coach of a Division I program.
Altogether though, Chow’s shortcomings are still evident. BYU launched him into coaching stardom, further propelled by his success at USC.  Since then, without the same level of talent that the Cougars and Trojans could muster, Chow has struggled to stay afloat.
The Warriors’ starting quarterback Sean Schroeder recently told the Hawai’i school newspaper, Ka Leo, that Chow is “an offensive genius.” His career path since 2005, though, might refute that bold proclamation.
 
“The Fifth Quarter” runs every other Wednesday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Alex at ajshultz@usc.edu.
How come the teams that had more talent failed to win national championships after Chow left if he is a product of having good players? To try to rewrite Chow’s importance to the revival of the program by pointing to his success after leaving the program is ludicrous. I guess we should expect a similar story on Pete Carroll since his record outside USC is terrible as well.

For Olympic swimmer Rebecca Soni, the last month of summer seemed nothing out of the ordinary for a Trojan alumna. She met up with old friends, relaxed as much as possible and took a trip to London.
Back for more · Former USC swimmer Rebecca Soni won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She won two more at the 2012 London games, but has yet to commit to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. – Photo courtesy of Sports Information
 
The primary difference was Soni returned from that trip across the pond with two gold medals.
After taking home a gold medal in the 200-meter breaststroke at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing after her junior season at USC, Soni successfully defended her title in  London. She also took home gold as a member of the U.S. women’s 4×100-meter medley relay team and nabbed silver in the 100-meter breaststroke.
Among Soni’s surplus of accomplishments in London, the U.S. swim team captain singled out her gold-medal-winning swim in the 200-meter backstroke as her crowning achievement.
“I was so happy to break the 2:19 mark,” Soni said.
Before becoming the first woman in history to swim the 200-meter breaststroke in under two minutes and 19 seconds, the signs for Soni’s record-breaking performance were present.
“In her warm-up preceding her 200-meter final, there was a breakthrough moment,” said USC swimming coach and Team USA assistant women’s coach Dave Salo, who has been Soni’s coach for almost six years.
In pre-competition workouts, Soni always warms up the same way: three 50-meter laps. Salo noticed something about her on that night.
“She hit those paces dead-on — [the] right number of stroke counts — and it kind of came easy,” Salo explained. “It was a quiet moment between her and me where we kind of looked at each other and had that acknowledgement that ‘you’re going to be really special tonight.’”
Sure enough, less than 2 1/2 minutes later, the pair’s forecast proved correct. Before her journey to the Olympics, though, Soni arrived at USC in the fall of 2005 out of West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North in Plainsboro, N.J.
“It was a pretty big decision to come all the way from New Jersey,” Soni said. “Everything all kind of came together. It was a fit between the swimming program and the academic challenge.”
Despite the adjustment, her success as a Trojan was immediate and resounding. She won the national title in the 200-yard breaststroke as a freshman in 2006, and proceeded to be the first woman in NCAA history to win the 200-yard breaststroke event four years in a row. She also won two national titles, one in the 100-yard breaststroke and another in the 200-yard breaststroke in 2008.
More impressively, she won gold in Beijing the summer after being a full-time student. Though some Olympic athletes might take a semester or a year off to train for the Games, Soni took a full course load in addition to training during her junior year.
Along the way, she continually received advice from Salo about swimming and life.
“‘Swim in your own lane — in and out of the pool,’” Soni recalled as the piece of advice she remembers most from Salo. “He said to follow your own path and do what makes sense to you.”
This attitude partially inspired Soni’s switch from majoring in business administration to communication.
“Being a [communication] major was not my original interest, but it made me learn how to do something outside of my comfort level,” Soni said. “It taught me how to get my point across.”
Though Soni has found success on an international level, her achievements have not overshadowed the pride she feels toward her alma mater.
“It’s great being from such an amazing school with over 40 athletes in the Olympics, and a school that cherishes its Olympians,” Soni said. “My medals are not just for Team USA, but I’m also bringing them home for USC.”
After earning three of USC’s 25 medals from London, Soni’s six total medals now ties her with track athlete Allyson Felix and former Australian swimmer Murray Rose for the most medals won by a Trojan alumna.
In addition to her personal accomplishments, Soni is also active in helping the current generation of Trojan athletes find success.
Soni has been a volunteer swim coach for the Trojans the last two years and will do so again this upcoming season. By swimming with the current squad and giving advice on technique, Soni feels her role is mutually beneficial.
“I’m not a certified instructor,” Soni said. “I just go out there and teach. Even though I’m a professional athlete now, it’s helped me to stay a part of the team.”
Salo has reaped the benefits of having the star around. “She’s a great resource,” Salo explained. “She’s still swimming and not too far removed from our program that she can’t enlighten the kids to what it’s like to be a Trojan swimmer.”
Soni maintains other connections to USC swimming, as well. Though no longer a student, she and her boyfriend, fellow gold medalist Ricky Berens, and many of the world’s top swimmers are a part of the Trojan Swim Club.
Coached by Salo, the team is exclusively for post-graduates and is another source of pride for Soni.
“She really has changed the profile of the athlete coming to USC and the how post-grads and international swimmers view our program,” Salo said.

After a perfect start to the season that saw the team win with relative ease, the Women of Troy failed to maintain the momentum in their home opener, falling 3-1 (20-25, 25-23, 21-25, 19-25) in an exhibition match to the Jiangsu Women’s Volleyball Team.
“We have some serious things that we need to work on, but it was good for all the young kids to play at home for the first time,” head coach Mick Haley said. “We had a chance to get it to a five game match, but unfortunately we weren’t able to do it.”
The team returned to the friendly confines of the Galen Center after jumping out of the gate to a 3-0 start in the Texas A&M Invitational over the weekend. However, the match was not an ordinary one for the Women of Troy. The exhibition game featured a matchup against a Jiangsu squad that has produced many world-renowned players in China but is still relatively unknown in NCAA circles.
“I thought we did pretty well considering we didn’t have a scouting report,” Haley said, laughing.
The first set saw the Women of Troy struggle early on, as Jiangsu jumped out to a 13-7 lead, powered by outside hitter Chen Yayun’s five kills. The team’s comeback efforts were met with strong resistance from Jiangsu, which extended its lead to 18-11 as Chen recorded two kills and setter Li Hui had an impressive nine assists. Back-to-back kills by freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio brought the Women of Troy within striking range, but Jiangsu responded with outside hitter Zhai Tingli’s kill bringing up set point. Senior middle blocker Natasa Slijkovic set up junior outside hitter Sara Shaw for a kill, but Jiangsu retaliated with a termination by Zhai to take the first set.
“I think the quickness of their offense really surprised us,” senior opposite Katie Fuller said. “Our blockers had to focus on certain things that we haven’t been exposed to yet, but it was a good experience.”
The second set opened with better results for the Women of Troy. After falling behind early 5-4, the team rallied for a 7-5 lead as junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard followed consecutive Jiangsu service errors with a kill set up by sophomore setter Hayley Crone. The set remained tight, as a service ace by outside hitter Wang Wei tied it at 17. The Women of Troy took care of business after that point, as Crone twice set up Fuller for kills to terminate the rally and tie the match at one set apiece. The set win came in spite of a .187 attack percentage for the Women of Troy, as Jiangsu registered a .261 attack percentage after two sets.
The Women of Troy came out strong after the break, posting an 11-5 lead in the third set on the strength of kills by Olgard and Bricio. A Shaw service error and subsequent ace by middle blocker Jiang Qianwen bookended a four point rally that saw Jiangsu close to within two, and another kill by Jiang tied the set at 16 all. The Women of Troy faltered down the stretch, as a Fuller kill was sandwiched between a Jiangsu service ace and a kill to give the visitors the second set.
The fourth set started slowly for the Women of Troy, who fell behind 10-5 before three straight kills brought them to within one at 11-10 and prompted a Jiangsu timeout. However, the visitors tallied four straight points, including back-to-back kills from Chen, to increase the lead to 15-10. Olgard took advantage of an empty left side for a kill that brought the Women of Troy to within 16-13. However, Jiangsu slowly pulled away, as attack errors proved costly for the Women of Troy. A kill by opposite Lu Qian set up match point, after which Lu struck again to end the match.
Despite the loss, Haley was satisfied with his team’s performance, regardless of the result.
“I’m pleased with the effort,” Haley said. “In two or three weeks I think we’ll look like a different team. They [Jiangsu] are a fun team to watch, they play and hit hard, and I think they’re a good team to make adjustments to.”

To most people, the number 1,836 might be just that -— a number.
But 1,836 should stand out as the official count of people who died as a result of Hurricane Katrina seven years ago, along with the billions of dollars lost in socio-economic damage.
The number 1,836 represents federal ignorance through the actions of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state-funded negligence through Gov. Kathleen Blanco’s lack of immediacy, the incompetence of the local government in not providing nearly enough for its residents and today, on the seventh anniversary of Katrina, a tendency to forget such a catastrophic event.
These kinds of actions and attitudes must not be repeated, nor should the lives and homes lost in Katrina be forgotten.
As students and citizens of the United States, we should learn from past mistakes in order to prevent them from occurring in the future.
The true tragedy of Hurricane Katrina was not only the lack of government response during and after the storm struck, but also the national response. A politicized and critical atmosphere emerged rather than a charitable one.  Certain religious leaders, such as Christian broadcaster Rev. Pat Robertson,  even claimed that Katrina was a form of divine punishment, brought on by New Orleans and the region.
Yet New Orleans and the Gulf Coast recovered — in spite of its fellow countrymen, not because of them.
It was an integral part of the human spirit — enduring persistence — that allowed the area and its people to rebuild. This very same persistence has helped in other misfortunes that have affected the region, such as the British Petroleum oil spill in April 2010.
Steps in the right direction have occurred this week, though: both the state and federal government have already established a line of aid should Hurricane Isaac be anything more than a tropical storm.
Evacuations have already taken place, the levees have been repaired adequately and Tulane University implemented mandatory residence hall lockdowns for students who live on campus. And since it’s an election year, all eyes are on how President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney might respond should things take a turn for the worst.
As students of USC, we attend a school that takes pride in providing guidance and new ideas for dealing with political, sociological and economic developments.  Katrina, however, even at its enormous scale, is no longer on the student body’s radar.
Politicians have moved on, the media has moved on, but our institution should assume a leading role in actively learning from the mistakes made during Katrina to better understand how to prevent a similar event from happening in the future.
If the worst happens, citizens and students shouldn’t just sit and argue about why something disastrous happened or whose fault it was.  They should ask questions and demand answers, take action and extend a helping hand to all in need.
For many, New Orleans represents the soul of America. There — much like the rest of the country — the future might seem cloudy and dark. But learning from the past to build a better future will only make the triumph that much greater.
America shouldn’t forget the 1,836. If they seek to criticize and do nothing, remember that half the victims or more could have been saved if more people simply stopped talking and did something above and beyond what was expected of them.

Thank you for noting the importance of learning from Katrina.  But in learning from an ACCURATE history, we have to put to rest the many urban myths that persist.  Blanco did demonstrate a sense of immediacy, declaring a state of emergency and activating the state’s response the moment Louisiana entered the forecast cone.  Just like Isaac, on a Friday Katrina was headed to Florida, by Saturday the track shifted – but unlike Isaac, Katrina was faster and hit on Monday morning.  She was on TV, radio, local and national, using every available form of communication to get people out.  The common misunderstanding on the timing of the evacuation is Louisiana’s PHASED plan, which prioritiezes citizens in coastal areas BEFORE those in New Orleans (you could see that in the state’s response to Isaac).  If all enter the interstate at once, you get gridlock and residents in the most vulnerable areas don’t get out.  So people assume the mandadory evacuation for New Orleans was late, when in fact, it was done in a certain order.  93% of the metro region evacuated before the storm.  The delay in rescuing the 60,000 who remained was due to the federal government waiting until the following Saturday to send troops – as President Bush outlined in his own book.  It’s because of these misconceptions that the Times-Picayune keeps its Katrina archives active – including what was submitted to the congressional record by state and local officials.  http://www.nola.com

New cardinal and gold flower beds, lampposts and a beautiful fountain are evidence of another season of successful summer construction at USC. One of the university’s upcoming projects, however, has come to a screeching halt.
This project is the redevelopment of the University Village shopping center — the biggest phase of the University’s 30-year Master Plan.
Since its beginnings in 2006, the Master Plan has advanced in leaps and bounds, with a rallying cry of eager USC students at its back. But when the Planning and Land Use Management Committee of the Los Angeles City Council put the project on hold last Tuesday, a voice less heard at USC— the surrounding community — was recognized at last.
The Village at USC, as the project is officially known, has always presented itself first to residents of the surrounding area and second to the student body. Students are easy to please; they have little reason to protest expanded dining and retail options. The community, however, is trickier.
The home page of the project’s website is entirely geared toward community members, promising neighborhood beautification, 12,000 jobs (4,000 construction-related and 8,000 permanent), a shiny new shopping experience and the substantial freeing up of low-income housing for community residents. The website even supplies project information in Spanish.
But aesthetic improvements won’t matter if the overwhelming student presence in the Village leaves the community feeling marginalized. And the majority of the 8,000 jobs that USC says are actually permanent won’t necessarily be for local residents. Though the website cheerily suggests, “You or a family member may even work on the construction of the Village,” it says nothing about potential employment with the Village’s future tenants.
This betrays our developers’ sneaky approach to the local community: Appease them about the project, but don’t actually include them in it. Tell them they can help build it, but conveniently forget to promise them a place in the permanent Village. Putting the project on hold opens up a crucial opportunity for the university to move past superficial promises to genuine inclusion of the community.
This approach finally hit a wall with the issue of low-income housing. While USC has consistently pitched the Village at USC as a creative solution to keep students from overtaking neighborhood housing and has offered an additional $2 million dollar contribution to support low-income housing in the area, community groups protested that this was a far too liberal assessment of the plan’s potential for success.
Representatives from United Neighbors In Defense Against Displacement (UNIDAD), a coalition of community, labor and faith groups, told the City Council’s panel last Tuesday that they believed USC students would continue to live in the neighborhood’s low-income units and that a more reasonable contribution for housing development would be $20 million.
UNIDAD’s concerns are well founded and need to be heard. According to U.S. News and World Report, 59 percent of USC students live in off-campus housing that is unaffiliated with the university. It is doubtful the Village would cause such an immediate shift in student housing preferences as to fill all 5,200 promised beds in the first year of operation.
One must also consider the type of student the Village housing will attract. It’s likely that the students who move into the Village will be those who already live in expensive and cloistered apartment complexes, like University Gateway or the new Icon Plaza — not the students who live in low-income units, who are comfortable among local residents and want to save on rent.
That USC hasn’t addressed these particular problems in its development planning shows the university has not thought the Village through from a community perspective. Perhaps the stonewalling of a $1.1 billion project is just what we need to ensure the local voice on the UV is finally heard.

This is absurd. Why should we care about supporting the community at the expense of USC students? The needs of USC and its students should always come first.
USC owes the “community” nothing.  UNIDAD is a very small group of people that want to blame USC for all their problems.  They are not entitled to USC subsidized housing.  USC has contributed to the education, beautification, and safety of this area.  The University wants to develop its own property and is entitled to do so regardless of the whiners who contribute nothing but complaints.
These are USC owned housing. They will fill-up immediately. What are you thinking?

USC’s much-scrutinized Master Plan is nothing short of ambitious.
The proposal, set to take place over 30 years, hopes to transform Jefferson Boulevard into a safe, pedestrian-friendly walkway and provide a proposed 5,200 new beds for student housing.
Maithili Mokashi | Daily Trojan
 
The plan was launched in 2006 with the expressed goals of “[creating] a safe, attractive, sustainable, residential campus and neighboring urban community,” and “[acting] as a catalyst for public and private non-university investment in the surrounding communities,” according to the plan’s website.
However ambitious and impractical it might sound, the implementation of the Master Plan is absolutely crucial to improving safety for the Trojan Family and continuing a positive legacy for the university.
It’s not news to USC students that the surrounding urban area is dangerous, even deadly.
The tragic deaths less than a mile from campus this April of USC graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu serve as painful reminders of the inherent dangers of the neighboring community. The tragedy received extensive local and international media attention, as the need for safe student housing became agonizingly clear.
The university even faces a lawsuit from the victims’ parents who claim USC officials had misled them about the severity of the dangers near campus. Students were left to explain to their parents, prospective students, alumni and themselves why USC had allowed such an inconceivable horror to occur.
USC’s Master Plan aims to alleviate some of these safety concerns by substantially increasing student housing and pouring millions of dollars into renovating the surrounding community.
The plan has certainly met its share of criticism. Many point to USC’s admittedly rocky relations with residents of the surrounding area. The proposal has been described as insensitive to the needs of local inhabitants, many of whom might be forced to relocate as a result of the changes.
Plans to incorporate major brand names into the retail space of the University Village, known around campus as the UV, have been derided as a callous method of eliminating jobs for lower income individuals, ensuring rent inflation for the neighborhood. Any changes might also threaten the urban culture of the UV, which is currently dominated by small businesses.
These criticisms are valid, at least to a degree. It’s naive to assume that members of the surrounding community will be unaffected by transformations to major residential and retail areas.
Cohabitation is a difficult and complex problem, especially when it involves the accommodation of two vastly different communities in a single space.
Yet the Master Plan sets out to reach an effective compromise. In an effort to appeal to both communities, local staples such as Superior Grocers will reportedly stand alongside retail brands such as Trader Joe’s in the renovated UV.
A shopping center will generate an increase in tax revenue for the area and although rent will likely rise, the increased economic activity should act as compensation. The shopping center will add more opportunities for long-term employment, as new retailers are much  more able to hire new employees than long-standing small businesses.
Protection of the surrounding area should be a major aspect of the Master Plan and should go hand in hand with USC’s primary concern: its students. Unprecedented growth in student enrollment in the past few years necessitates the need for safer student housing near campus, and the growth will only continue.
The university needs to expand to accommodate this growth. Change will happen, and as evidenced by recent events, perhaps it needs to happen. In its quest for successful change, USC should look to similar cases at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University as examples of positive urban redevelopment.
The Master Plan is ambitious, but so is USC. The university has seen massive changes recently and has “fought on” against hardship, attaining excellence in many different fields.
USC’s maxim, “Building on Excellence,” enables students, faculty and alumni to feel pride in being part of the Trojan Family.
It’s time USC uses that same indomitable spirit to transform its  surrounding area.

Who cares about the thugs who live in the community and rob USC students? We SHOULD be pushing them out by raising rent and eliminating jobs…that will drive them away and make the community safer for USC students.
I also hope the school plans to emulate the model of UPenn and Columbia. The neighborhood can’t accomodate a project like the Stanford Shopping Center.
USC’s primary concern is its students, but that’s not the communities concern and we are talking about a project that takes over the community…
Sounds interesting. What’s the plan?

The changes USC Transportation has implemented for the new school year could be a
positive transition back into the fall semester for faculty and students alike.
The USC community can get excited about the return of the Extended Boundaries
Shuttle, which is run by DPS. This shuttle, which runs from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., will take
riders to their homes outside of the allowed areas for all Campus Cruisers, according
to USC Transportation. To order a ride for a trip home, call DPS directly at 213-740-
6000 and a dispatcher will inform you where to meet your shuttle. A map outlining the
boundaries of this new shuttle can be found on the USC Transit website.
Students said these shuttles will reduce the hassle of getting to locations just beyond the
reach of the Campus Cruiser scope. “Student safety, especially in this area, should be a
priority for the USC community. It’s nice to see that DPS is making positive strides in
that area,” Michael Eidman, a junior majoring in communications, said.
The Campus Cruiser fan base will have something to celebrate as well. The student-
driven cars already started service for the semester on Aug. 24. These cruisers are
open from 6 p.m. to 2:45 a.m., while the Leavey Lift will begin operating starting
August 28th, at 3am. Information on Campus Cruiser can be found on via Twitter at
@CampusCruiserSC or by texting “Follow CampusCruiser SC” to 40404. Information
about scheduling a lift can be found on the USC Transit website as well.
Late nights at Leavey Library, The Row or on campus just got safer for some students.
“I am excited to see USC investing in its students and their safety. Particularly in their
regard to extra-curricular and off-campus activities,” Kevin McKormick, a junior
majoring in business administration, said.
Many common and popular USC bus routes have also altered their routine for the
upcoming semester. Various changes to route schedules, stops, and bus times became
effective Monday. The new USCBus schedules and routes can all also be found on the
USC Transit website. Timely information on delays or cancellations are available on
Twitter under the handle @USCBuses.
Definitely great news! I just hope they will have that implemented as soon as possible. This shouldn’t be just for now but for good. And the parents will be able to have peace of mind because their kids got a transportation to and from school.
That is great news! Nothing is more important for USC than the safety of their students. They are doing the right decision on bringing back the Extended Bounderies shuttle. Students and faculty will have the convenience they deserve with the increased shuttle and bus options.

The No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team started its season with a bang, riding the strong play of its freshmen to a 3-0 start at the Texas A&M Invitational this past weekend.
Setting the tone · Senior opposite Katie Fuller, who earned 2011 American Volleyball Coaches Association Pac-12 Region Honorable Mention, recorded 29 kills in three matches at the Texas A&M Invitational. – Daily Trojan file photo
The Women of Troy, coming off back-to-back Final Four appearances, wasted no time in their quest for another deep season, sweeping North Dakota in the season opener 3-0 (25-20, 25-23, 25-21). The win marked the 10th time the team has won its season-opening match in 12 years under head coach Mick Haley.
“Coming in to this tournament, we were all very excited, and our freshmen have come ready to play,” senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller said. “Going 3-0 is a good feeling, and it’s definitely a strong start to the season.”
The first game was close early on as North Dakota closed to within a 16-15 margin after an early 11-6 deficit, but the Women of Troy pulled away to win 25-20, led by Fuller’s eight kills. The Women of Troy registered 19 kills in the first set while holding the Sioux to 10.
The second set saw more of the same, as the Sioux nullified an early 14-8 USC lead to tie the game 17-all. After a back-and-forth battle that saw the Women of Troy take a 24-23 lead, a final kill by junior outside hitter Sara Shaw ended the rally and put the team one win away from a victory. Sure enough, the Sioux put the Women of Troy to the test in the third set, taking an early 12-8 lead, but a 9-3 run gave USC a 17-15 lead, and Shaw delivered her second straight game-winning kill to give the Women of Troy a four-point win and a sweep to start the season.
The Women of Troy saw more competition from Texas A&M, but rebounded from a first-set loss to take the match 3-1 (26-28, 25-14, 25-18, 25-20). USC received significant contributions from its younger core, as sophomore setter Hayley Crone registered a double-double with 42 assists and 12 digs, while highly touted freshman Samantha Bricio registered a match-high 14 kills.
After a close early set, the Women of Troy came back with a dominant second frame, channeling an early 7-0 lead into a 25-14 win. Crone found Fuller for a kill to give USC set point, after which a tandem block by Crone and junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard sealed the win. The third set saw much of the same, as the Women of Troy staked themselves to a 10-5 lead. A kill by Bricio put the team up 20-15, after which a pair of Fuller kills and a Texas A&M service error gave the Women of Troy a win.
The Aggies put up more of a fight after two blowout sets, but couldn’t push through for a win. A service ace from Crone put USC ahead 24-19 after back-and-forth play, and her set to Shaw sealed the match.
The third and final match saw the Women of Troy rout Texas State in straight sets (25-18, 25-19, 25-22) for their second sweep in three games. In the first set, Bricio and fellow freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms recorded four kills each, and sophomore middle blocker Hannah Schraer notched kills on the final two plays to give the Women of Troy a win.
After a relatively light second set in which USC built leads of 10-3 and 16-7, the team was tested in the third set, as the Bobcats claimed the first three points. However, senior defensive specialist Erin Yoder’s second ace, one of six total for USC in the match, tied things at 10. The Women of Troy later overcame a four point-deficit to take a 19-18 lead and Ogoms recorded the final point to give the Women of Troy the victory.
Strong play by Fuller and junior libero Natalie Hagglund earned the two all-tournament honors, but even more significant for the team was Bricio being named MVP in her first tournament. The Guadalajara, Mexico native registered 37 kills and 26 digs.
“She’s been amazing for us,” Fuller said. “Coming in from Mexico is such a difficult transition, but she has been playing phenomenally well, and I think everyone’s pleased with her performance so far.”
The Women of Troy will play a quick exhibition match against Jiangsu, China on Aug. 28, after which they’ll host the Luxe City Center Trojan Invitational starting Friday, August 31. For now, coach Mick Haley is pleased with the team’s start.
“We have a lot of talent,” Haley said. “We’re very physical this year, and by the middle of October we can be pretty darn good.”

At first, I couldn’t help but smirk.
Earlier this month, USC released a handful of promotional videos for the upcoming season, highlighted by the slogan: “We play for the 90,000 faithful. ”
Coming in droves · USC has already sold out home games against Hawai’i, Oregon and Notre Dame a week before the season begins. – Daily Trojan file photo
The implication, of course, is that the Trojans will be suiting up in front of sellout crowds at the 93,607-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this season, which begins Saturday against Hawai’i.
The only problem, though, is they don’t typically do so. As much as USC carries around the title of the West Coast’s premier college football program, its attendance numbers have never completely reflected its success.
In spite of 109 victories and two national championships, the Coliseum only averaged slightly more than 90,000 fans per game in two seasons in the past decade — 91,480 in 2006 and 90,812 in 2005.
And consider this: The Coliseum never averaged a sellout during a season in the last two years sold out a total of just two games, matchups against Stanford and UCLA last fall.
But on the eve of the 2012 season, it looks like my initial skepticism might be slightly off the mark, and of course, if it is, I can eat crow. By the look of things, USC’s going to play in front of 90,000 in just about every game.
Last week, USC announced the opener against Hawai’i is sold out, coming on the heels of news that the Nov. 3 contest against Oregon and the Nov. 24 meeting with Notre Dame are sold out as well. Not to mention only about 1,000-2,000 tickets, according to a school spokesman, are left for the three remaining games — California, Colorado and Arizona State.
So it’s certainly conceivable every game will be filled to maximum capacity. In fact, it’s more likely than not.
“It’s exciting,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It goes with all the off-season hype that’s great for our university, that’s great for our fans. Our players will be excited to see that and that’s what should be happening at ‘SC.”
Of course they’re excited, but Kiffin and his staff have also made the conscious decision to downplay the hype this offseason.
They’ve muttered the now-clichéd phrase “it’s about the prep, not about the hype” almost ad nauseam for the last eight months. That’s part of the job description. Coaches want to coach and largely ignore the extra attention. Their foremost concern is game preparation and they want that mindset to reach their players.
But really, if we’re being realistic after all, the hype for this fall is unprecedented even by 2005 standards, when Matt Leinart and Co. were hobnobbing it in Hollywood with Nick Lachey and a host of other celebrities and A-listers.
Ticket prices weren’t adjusted for this season’s slate of games. Packages, by and large, remained the same.
But the interest has perked. Demand is up. USC’s atop a handful of preseason polls, most notably the one compiled by the Associated Press. It’s L.A. after all, and the Coliseum should be full.
“It’s our job to stay up there [in the rankings],” Kiffin reiterated last week. “It’s not the fans’ job to come. It’s our job to put the product on the field so they do come.”
He’s right.
In this market, in Southern California, you have to win, and a year after doing so 10 times, USC’s expected attendance figures finally appear to mirror the expectations.
The product, on the surface, appears healthy at last.
It wasn’t so long ago USC was in the top-five, but after about three seasons puttering around in relative mediocrity, it’s back so to speak, inching toward the top.
Three years is a long time by major college football standards and most are eager to witness the Trojans’ rise. So of course an attendance spike was to be expected.
But this is quite the jump, unlike anything in recent memory: at least three sellouts by August.
The fan base is hungry. And whether fair or unfair, there’s a lot for the Trojans to live up to come kickoff in four days.

The first two home matches of the USC women’s soccer season yielded two drastically different results, as the Women of Troy split a pair of nonconference matchups over the weekend by defeating Saint Mary’s 4-1 Friday before falling to Minnesota 4-1 Sunday.
Showing the ropes · On a team that featured eight new starters against Saint Mary’s on Friday, senior midfielder Samantha Johnson is one prominent holdover. In three games, she has registered one goal and four shots. – Daily Trojan file photo
The Women of Troy (2-1) took their first loss of the season on Sunday despite outshooting the Gophers 16-15.
Freshman forward Katie Johnson scored her first career goal for USC on a close-range shot in the 25th minute to draw first blood for the Women of Troy.
Freshman defender Marlee Carrillo chucked a throw-in all the way into the center of the box, where sophomore midfielder Alex Quincey headed the ball toward the back post to let Johnson tap it in for a 1-0 lead.
“We knew that in the first five minutes after [a goal] and in the beginning of the game we needed to be focused,” Johnson said. “Those are the most crucial times in a game.”
The Women of Troy applied consistent pressure at the beginning of the contest, with Johnson even drilling the crossbar on a powerful shot.
Similar squandered scoring chances shifted momentum in Minnesota’s favor.
Less than three minutes after Johnson’s goal, USC found itself down 2-1 thanks to two quick responses from the Gophers.
Minnesota forward Taylor Uhl, who played with USC sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley on a regional team in high school, gathered a cross in the box and sent a strike past her old teammate for the equalizer in the 26th minute.
Less than two minutes later, the Gophers struck again when a save from Stanley rebounded to Minnesota midfielder Taylor Wodnick, who knocked in the close-range shot.
“We scored a pretty good goal, and then it just got really flat,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “Anytime you play a well-organized, disciplined group, and you make the kind of mistakes we made, they’re going to punish you for it.”
Before the end of the first half,  freshman forward Megan Borman was denied on a breakway by Minnesota goalkeeper Cat Parkhill, who turned in an exceptional performance for the Gophers.
After escaping the first half with the lead intact, Minnesota put the game out of reach by capitalizing on a USC defensive miscue in the 69th minute.
Minnesota midfielder Allie Phillips intercepted an errant pass deep in USC’s territory before giving the ball to Uhl, who capitalized on a one-on-one with Stanley for her second goal of the game.
The fourth and final score came courtesy of Phillips in the 73rd minute. Her arching lob from the left side of the box sailed over Stanley’s head into the net.
In response to the four unanswered goals, Khosroshahin insisted that his team cannot let small mistakes snowball into a greater deficit.
“We’ve got to be a little bit more alert; we’ve got to pay attention to the details,” Khosroshahin said. “I think we took too many mental breaks, and we got punished for it.”
The Women of Troy’s goalie agreed.
“There were some defensive breakdowns that I felt heavily responsible for,” Stanley said. “I hold myself to a higher standard than how I played today.”
Sunday’s letdown was a stark contrast from Friday’s 4-1 victory, which yielded the highest scoring home opener for USC since their 2007 national championship season.
It also marked the first time USC had started the season 2-0 and won both its home and season openers since 2008.
Eight newcomers to the program started on Friday, reflecting the roster makeover the team underwent after finishing 7-13 last year.
Twenty of the squad’s 34 players, including 16 freshmen, are donning the Cardinal and Gold for the first time this season.
Those fresh faces shone brightly against the Gaels, as three freshman accounted for USC’s four goals.
Forward Megan Borman netted two scores for the Women of Troy, and defender Erin Owen and forward Whitney Pitalo added a goal apiece as USC outshot Saint Mary’s 26-8.
In contrast to the game against Minnesota, the Women of Troy responded promptly when the Gaels got to within one goal in the 53rd minute of play on a tally by Celina Minnisian.
In less than 10 minutes, Borman took advantage of a loose ball in the box to net her second goal.
Of course, inexperience might bring inconsistency at first.
Stanley says she expects USC’s inexperience to cause a wide range of results on the field.
“We have so many new players, and it’s expected that you’re going to have your ups and downs,” Stanley said. “We just need to keep our heads up and take this [weekend] as a learning experience.”
The Women of Troy won’t have to wait long to see if they learned anything valuable from their first two home games — they host No. 2 Duke on Friday at 4 p.m. as part of the USC Futbol Classic.

If you ever get the chance to shake senior center Khaled Holmes’ hand, don’t be surprised if your hands completely disappear in his grip. Holmes’ hands are massive for a reason.
It’s a snap · Holmes leads an offensive line that returns four starters and only yielded eight sacks in 2011, the fewest in the nation. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Though the offensive firepower of USC is epitomized by the precise arm of senior quarterback Matt Barkley and the agile legs of sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee and junior wide receiver Robert Woods, the play always starts in the hands of the center.
Ever since he switched over to center from right guard last season, Holmes has grasped this crucial and often unappreciated responsibility and has never let go.
In Holmes’ first year at the position, Holmes and left tackle Matt Kalil, who now plays for the Minnesota Vikings, bolstered an offensive line that gave up just eight sacks, the fewest in the country.
The line also helped the run game average 4.98 yards on the ground, good for third in the Pac-12.
Now, Holmes and the line will attempt to match those feats without Kalil, who was drafted by the Vikings with the fourth pick.
“I was nothing but happy for [Kalil],” Holmes said. “He was the best lineman in the draft, and he’s going to be a great player in the NFL.”
The praise comes from the heart, but it also represents the void that Kalil will leave behind.
“He left some big shoes to fill,” Holmes said.
Barkley, who has played quarterback with Holmes protecting him at the line since their days together at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, has no doubts that his longtime friend will embrace the challenge.
“[Holmes] is the guy. He’s the guy to center that line and anchor it,” Barkley said. “He’s really established himself, I think, as one of the premier centers, if not linemen, in the country.”
Along with Holmes, three other starters on the offensive line will return in junior right tackle Kevin Graf, junior guard John Martinez and sophomore guard Marcus Martin, but gone are the days of Kalil reliably protecting Barkley’s blindside.
Now more than ever, Holmes will step up as the leader of the line as the Trojans gear up for a national championship run. Having a year of center experience to build on will definitely help.
“It’s like anything -— the more you do it, the more comfortable you are, the better you get at it,” Holmes said. “I was a little apprehensive with some things last year, but, day by day, it got more and more comfortable.”
Holmes started his USC career as a backup right guard during his redshirt freshman season in 2009.
As a sophomore, Holmes started every game at right guard and earned All-Pac-10 honorable mention honors.
After center Kristofer O’Dowd graduated, Holmes took his place and was named to the 2011 All-Pac-12 second team.
He is now a leading candidate for the Rimington Award, given to the best center in the nation, and he certainly has the credentials to lead the Trojan linemen into the trenches and be what he calls “a coach on the field.”
As the center, Holmes must have the body to withstand and neutralize a defense’s nose tackle. His 6-foot-4, 305-pound build takes care of that.
He must also have the brains to recognize defensive schemes and adjust blocking assignments before the play.
His pursuit of a master’s degree in communication management might speak to that.
And lastly, he must have the chemistry with the quarterback for pinpoint timing and successful snaps. His friendship with Barkley since the sixth grade exemplifies that.
It’s no coincidence that Barkley and Holmes are now the two offensive captains.
“I’ve known him forever, so we actually have a really good relationship,” Holmes said. “I think that extra trust and understanding has been nothing but helpful.”
Because nearly every play USC runs this season will begin with Barkley and Holmes, it is vital that the two are in sync.
It seems that it would be difficult for the two of them not to be.
“He’s played every position on the line for me — left tackle in high school, and guard and now center,” Barkley said. “I’d say we’re best friends on the team.”
Their relationship continues to grow every day with every snap on the field and every minute together off the field.
“We live right next to each other. We spend a ton of time together, and I think that just helps with knowing each other, making jokes and letting some things slide,” Barkley said. “We don’t get angry at each other. We understand each other on the field.”
Once the season is over, Holmes will find himself alongside Barkley yet again — this time at the 2013 NFL draft — but, until then, his hands are holding on tight for what could be a memorable last season at USC.
“I’ll approach this year like every other,” Holmes said. “But I’ll look up every minute and realize that everything I do is going to be last time I do it here. It’s pretty crazy how fast it’s gone by.”

A number of freshmen and a smattering of sophomores and upperclassmen flocked to McCarthy Quad on Saturday for the annual Welcome Back Concert, presented by the USC Program Board Concerts Committee. The line-up consisted of R&B artist and USC alumna Raquel Rodriguez, indie-electro band Electric Guest and the headliner mashup duo The White Panda.
After winning the 2012 National College Battle of the Bands, Rodriguez has received much attention as a powerful singer who draws influence from artists like Ella Fitzgerald and Amy Winehouse.
Synthesizers and falsettos · The genre-defying band Electric Guest dazzled USC audiences on Saturday at the Welcome Back Concert. Other acts such as White Panda and Raquel Rodriguez also entertained the masses. – Grace Ko | Daily Trojan
Her set was tame: a couple of original, not too over-the-top songs and a cover of the Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie,” which showcased her seemingly effortless soulful crooning.
But Electric Guest, which followed Rodriguez, took the concert from funk and soul to synthesizers and spot-on falsettos.
Based in Los Angeles, Electric Guest is made up of lead singer Asa Taccone, drummer Matthew Compton and brothers Tory and Todd Dahlhoff. Though Electric Guest is known primarily as an indie band, there really is no one genre that accurately describes the band’s music.
The songs were mostly upbeat, with catchy, techno rifts that Taccone sang over in his extremely versatile voice. Taccone’s stage presence was like that of a lava lamp: unpredictable but with a degree of continual ebb and flow. His limbs flew about in the heat of a song. He bounced. He appeared to be some sort of mystical superhuman dancing in the purple lights and stage fog.
Electric Guest’s “Amber” was a song along the lines of reggae electro pop. Singing “Amber” in his soft but controlled-to-a-tee falsetto throughout the whole song, Taccone could have made any girl with the name faint. It was unique, yet catchy and alluring.
Another one of Electric Guest’s more popular songs, “This Head I Hold,” sent the crowd whooping and cheering as soon as the distinct piano intro started playing.
After such an outstanding performance by Electric Guest, it seemed that no other act could outdo the band.
Except for The White Panda.
The two behind The White Panda, Tom Evans and USC alumnus Dan Griffith, are taking the mashup world by storm. Through their remixing ingenuity, it is no wonder The White Panda came in as one of SoundCloud’s top-five most-played artists in the last year.
As the stage was being set, students snapped on their panda masks and eagerly, almost aggressively, chanted for The White Panda. When crowd anticipation reached its peak, Evans and Griffith popped up from behind their DJ stand wearing furry, bejeweled panda masks that, unsurprisingly, also lit up.
The duo did not hold back at any time during their set. They started with a bang and also ended with one. As the lights whizzed and rotated from the stage, the screams and rhythmic throbbing of light-up foam sticks from the crowd mirrored the energy of the panda-masked men moving and jumping from behind their stand.
The White Panda’s mashups incorporated songs from the popular British boy band One Direction to La Roux’s Bulletproof, among other top-40 hits (and some more obscure ones). But no matter what songs they were tinkering with, the two were able to create addicting and hypnotic sounds from just about anything.
Depending on a student’s personal preference, any of the sets could have been his or her personal favorite. Rodriguez’s untouchable vocals and jazzy band made for easy, mellow listening. The charisma radiating from Electric Guest as well as Taccone’s soft and sentimental voice was fresh and memorable. Then there was The White Panda and the band members’ ability to pump up a crowd with quick, trance-like music.
This year’s Welcome Back Concert had something to offer to everyone, from low-key bluesy sounds to alternative music and wild, fist-pumping beats.

“I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Can’t stop. Don’t want to, either.”
So says actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the first five minutes of his new film Premium Rush, an end-of-summer thriller that takes audiences on a wild goose chase through New York City.
Filled with fast-paced editing, quirky one-liners and charming performances from Gordon-Levitt and co-star Michael Shannon, the film provides a mindless but amusing addition to the torrent of action movies usually released during late summer. But with heavily-advertised films such as The Expendables 2 and The Bourne Legacy raking in box office revenue, Premium Rush’s youthful style is easily lost among more blockbuster action flicks.
Similar to Kevin Bacon’s 1986 film Quicksilver, Premium Rush follows protagonist “Wilee” — named after the infamous Wile E. Coyote — who works as an adrenaline-seeking bike messenger in New York City. Wilee and his fellow bikemates Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) and Manny (Wolé Parks) whiz through downtown Manhattan traffic on tricked-out bikes, picking up packages, performing tricks and dodging the mundanity of post-collegiate life as they pride themselves on handling deliveries too time-sensitive for the likes of FedEx and UPS. But when Wilee accepts a job from the secretive Nyma (Jamie Chung), a simple delivery puts him smack dab in the middle of a sinister plot between corrupt police officer Robert Monday (Shannon) and a Chinese gambling organization.
Premium Rush, though problematic, works because of its raw, rebellious attitude. Childhood fans of shows like Nickelodeon’s 1999 Rocket Power will appreciate the way spry bikers flaunt their stunts with athletic ease and take painful crashes with quick grimaces before hopping right back up again. The bikers often engage in playful if poorly-written banter through their wired headphones as they bob and weave through New York traffic. The gang demonstrates a unified front against authority as they tease one another and tear up the streets with bike races. These tough characters get hurt, throw insults in one another’s faces and consistently deliver a series of corny one-liners like “This is the most fun I’ve had with my clothes on.” All in all, their bohemian lifestyle seems an amusing alternative to a career in corporate America — a non-conformist theme that resonates throughout the film.
Premium Rush also makes use of superb editing. In addition to splicing together a series of well-choreographed stunts, dollied shots and unusual camera angles, the film relies on modern technology to put audiences directly in Wilee’s daredevil mind. Because Wilee prides himself on riding without brakes, he relies on his uncanny knack for planning escape routes to get him out of even the most hopeless traffic jams.
Instead of simply dangling jaw-dropping stunts in front of the audience, the filmmakers use heavy graphics to demonstrate Wilee’s thought process. A slow zoom into Gordon-Levitt’s blue-gray eyes brings audiences into Wilee’s imagination where, through a series of computerized arrows and digitized figures, the hero figures out a way to get to his drop-off spot without harming himself and others. This technique also adds a bit of comedy into the film as Wilee imagines himself slamming into the window of a taxi, running into squealing women with children and knocking a pedestrian under an oncoming UPS truck.
At the center of these cinematic techniques is the film’s fascination with youthful rebellion. One scene between Gordon-Levitt and Shannon particularly reveals Premium Rush’s emphasis on dismissing authority. While an injured Wilee rides in an ambulance under the watchful gaze of the villainous Monday, he listens to the corrupt police officer complain about the younger generation’s filthy habit of casually using the phrases “douchebag” and “suck it.”
Of course, when Wilee triumphs over Monday, his winning line is “Suck it, douchebag.”
The rest of the film carries on this same attitude. A bus full of school children gleefully points one of Wilee’s uniformed pursuers in the wrong direction. None of the bikers seem to care for the police’s protests to halt or slow down. Most of the cops pursuing Wilee seem particularly inept, struggling to keep up with the clever and physically fit hero.
At its core, Premium Rush advocates sticking it to the man.
There are, however, a few holes in the film’s logic.
As the film uses an achronological narrative structure to explain the motivations of different characters, time becomes a bit unbelievable. Technically, Premium Rush takes place over the course of three hours, but as the film jumps rewinds the clock to give backstory, time becomes almost illogical. The bikers seem to be everywhere at once, sometimes managing to jump dozens of New York blocks in a matter of minutes.
The film’s resolution, which takes place over several action sequences, also ignores time. In the final 45 minutes of the film, Wilee is hit by a car, blacks out, rides through downtown on an ambulance, regains his bike, defeats Monday and delivers his package in what is supposed to be 27 minutes — an element of the plot that is unbelievable, particularly considering the heavy involvement of New York rush hour traffic in the film.
Premium Rush also blunders through Wilee’s most vulnerable scenes. At one point when Wilee needs medical assistance for an injury, the audience overhears a medic telling Monday that he has a couple of bruised ribs that require proper care. Yet, in the next scene, Wilee is on his bike and doing tricks again, jumping over cars and riding on elevated platforms to get out of a warehouse surrounded by policemen. Then, just a short while later, Wilee is groaning and clutching his ribcage as he glides down the street, hindered by injuries that seemed nonexistent just a few moments before.
Though it’s not the best thriller of the year, Premium Rush is a grade above the typical action film and provides a fun ending to the summer.

The first solo show.
It’s what most artists look forward to as their chance to break into the art world and gain notoriety.
Artistic ambiguity · Lichtenstein’s “The Man with Folded Arms” mimics Paul Cézanne’s original work of a similar title. – Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Yet for pop painter Roy Lichtenstein, the first solo show in Los Angeles would go down in art history not as a simple display of talent but a showcase of humor. The painter’s “Portrait of Madame Cézanne” was recorded as one of the most controversial works of the show. The simple outline with lines, arrows and letters looks innocent on first glance, but the painting’s background drove art critics up the wall.
The original “Portrait of Madame Cézanne” was painted in the 19th century by the legendary Paul Cézanne. Then, in 1942, artist and author Erle Loran created a diagram of the outline of the woman’s body in Cézanne’s piece to analyze in a formal manner.
Lichtenstein decided to have a little fun with Loran’s diagram. He took the outline and gave it the title of Cézanne’s original painting. Cézanne’s masterpiece, stripped of its splendor, became a painter outline by a pop artist just forming his identity as an L.A. trickster.
Today, the work doesn’t startle the art history world as much as it did during its first unveiling. In fact, Lichtenstein’s work resides in many established art museums. At the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown Los Angeles, a similar work hangs for new and old art lovers to admire. Lichtenstein’s 1962 piece, “Man with Folded Arms,” also takes the outline of a Cézanne painting, “Man with Crossed Arms,” although this time the outline has a face.
“Man with Folded Arms” serves as a reminder that it’s never quite certain what will be taken as art and what will be deemed not worth seeing. In each era, artists feel they need to do something new, but they can never say for certain whether their generation will appreciate that work. Though this piece showed at Lichtenstein’s first solo show, it’s unlikely anyone predicted its eventual inclusion in one of Los Angeles’ most important museum art collections.
Today, Lichtenstein’s name brings up ideas of Pop Art and an aesthetic that references comic strips and other scenes from pop culture. He reincarnated images like dramatic love scenes in a way that exposed their ridiculous nature. Using Ben-Day dots, Lichtenstein recreated the aesthetic look of the images in a style that brought him fame. One such work, “Drowning Girl,” now hangs at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, also a huge signaler of the art world’s best.
Except for its lack of color and the Ben-Day dots, “Man with Folded Arms” looks exactly the same as Cézanne’s original “Man with Crossed Arms.” That brings up another nagging question in the art world and pop culture: If a work copies or resembles something else, does that make it worthy of our attention?
The lines of “Man with Folded Arms” make the piece look sparse. The piece could almost be a page in a coloring book — it’s almost as if the man is waiting for someone to give his outfit a style and  his hair some color. These factors make it even more obvious that the work is a copy. It doesn’t attempt to create any unique characteristics of its own. Instead, it takes the core of Cézanne’s original piece and reveals it to the world.
If anything is original, it’s Lichtenstein’s idea of stripping away all of Cézanne’s presence from the art piece. Even if Lichtenstein saw most of his own “Man with Folded Arms” as humorous, he still gained enough courage to present this piece to the art world as something worthy of hanging in a gallery. He made the original work something worth analyzing and challenged one of art history’s masters.
Today, the question of originality and worth continues. If a song borrows a beat from one that came out decades ago, is it actually new and exciting? If a street artist uses the same stenciling style as another one from the ’80s, is he worthy of being a subculture king? Ultimately, the question won’t be answered until several generations from now. Today’s art museums decided who to show us from the art world of decades ago;  the next generation will see our artists as the ones to remember.
With the advent of technology, perhaps we have more say in who is remembered and who gets forgotten. If anything, Lichtenstein’s “Man with Folded Arms” comes as proof that originality doesn’t always come first. Maybe the ultimate way of making art — and being remembered — lies in creating something that gets people talking.
 
Eva Recinos is a senior majoring in English. Her column “Two Cents a Piece” runs Tuesdays.
May be we stop over analyzing after the fact, guessing the true reasons behind why he decided to put this piece into his first exhibit. We will never truly know. Maybe he was simply trying to fill-up the gallery, as so many artists do so.
