Ida Abhari | Daily Trojan
The road to studying abroad for me probably involved a bit more twists and turns than for those who opted for more traditional destinations — and of course, I probably brought some of it upon myself for selecting Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, Turkey early Fall 2015.
First came the email from Overseas Studies that the program was subject to being canceled by USC for safety reasons. They gave us the option to apply for a few other universities, and I hesitantly chose the University of Edinburgh as my backup. No offense to Edinburgh of course — I’ve heard great things about it as an institution and city — but I, perhaps irrationally, wanted to go to Istanbul. Ultimately, after the Turkish elections, USC made the decision to continue with the program. The three other USC students who had also selected Istanbul, however, dropped out.
Next came lectures from my mom. “It’s not a good time for Turkey,” she said. And she had a point. Istanbul, and Turkey as a whole, are beautiful places with plenty of cultural heritage and awe-inspiring natural sites, home to ancient and great civilizations ranging from the Hittites, Byzantines and Ottomans. Turkish people are welcoming hosts, eager to show you a country and culture of which they are very proud. Though officially over 90 percent Muslim, Turkey is a strictly secular democracy and has been in the process of negotiating to join the European Union.
In the last few years, however, Turkey has been undergoing plenty of political change. Domestically, potential changes to the country’s constitution could significantly alter the country’s democratic system. Internationally, Turkey’s 511-mile long border with Syria has seen much movement across it, from Syrian refugees looking for a path to Europe to Turkish troops and extremist members of Syrian rebel groups, including ISIS. Furthermore, an internal 30-year long violent conflict with Kurdish groups, who have been labeled terrorists by both the American and Turkish governments and have targeted civilians in attacks inside Turkey, has restarted this year after a ceasefire that lasted a few short years.
So, I went in with eyes wide open. I think it would be hard to go in otherwise. After the Paris attacks in November of 2015 that killed 130 people – the city’s second instance of terror after the January Charlie Hebdo attacks — I was mournful, but also mindful that violence could happen anywhere, as it had in Beirut, Garissa, and San Bernardino, as well as countless other places. And unfortunately, a few short weeks later, it did — in Istanbul, on Jan. 12, a suicide bomber detonated his weapons in the middle of a group of German tourists visiting the Hagia Sofia, a former Byzantine church and Ottoman mosque that is now a museum.
“I know why you want to go,” my mom said. “You like history, you want to go somewhere that feels more authentic. But it’s not worth it right now.” Her words definitely had truth to them. But I had to make my own decision. And after talking to several people in Istanbul, friends who were there last year and obsessively consulting the news and other sources, I made the decision to go. It wasn’t easy, on me, or my family. But so far, I am supremely happy I am here.
Boğaziçi’s campus is on the European side of Istanbul, away from the hustle and bustle of the city center, but close enough that a short metro ride reminds you that the city, is, in fact, Europe’s largest with over 15 million people. The university, older than USC, started in the 19th century as Robert College, founded by Americans, and overlooks the Bosphorus strait that divides Europe and Asia. The campus, and Istanbul and the country as a whole, is filled with cats and dogs that call it home and have a veterinarian and a student club dedicated to looking after them. I’m one of “those” people who is peculiarly obsessed with cats, so the campus is basically a dream come true. You can’t really sit down anywhere to enjoy the breathtaking sea views without a dog or group of cats coming over to be pet.
The other students I’ve met here are, like me, aware of the additional risks present in Istanbul and Turkey. But we’re also aware of how infinitesimal they are — and also how, unfortunately, nowadays, they are almost impossible to escape from in any corner of the world. C’est la vie.

The road woes continued for the No. 23 USC Trojans as they dropped their third consecutive road game, 74-67, to the Arizona State Sun Devils Friday night. 
The Trojans (18-6, 7-4) also dropped their eight straight game as a ranked team. 
Sophomore guard Tra Holder led the Sun Devils (14-11, 4-8) with 20 points, including a dagger 3-pointer that put Arizona State up nine with less than two minutes left in the game. 
Junior forward Nikola Jovanovic led all scorers with 25 points to go along with 15 rebounds. As a team, the Trojans shot over 51 percent from the field but could not overcome 17 turnovers. 
Arizona State finished with 17 offensive rebounds and were able to withstand a late second half push from the Trojans. The Sun Devils out-hustled the Trojans on both sides of the ball from start to finish. 
“We let them loose and they cut the lead to two,” Sun Devil forward Savon Goodman said. “Coach was on us about that. We got defensive stops and were able to play with the lead and finish strong.”
The Men of Troy got off to a slow start, turning the ball over on three of their first four possessions. Arizona State jumped out to an early 8-4 lead before the Trojans settled into their offense. 
The Trojans finished the half shooting 57 percent from the field and held the Sun Devils to just 33 percent. However, 11 turnovers from USC to go along with eight offensive rebounds allowed Arizona State to stay within reach at the half. The Trojans took a 30-27 lead into the locker room. 
The Men of Troy couldn’t shake the rust to start the second half as they saw their lead vanish before their eyes. Behind five straight points Holder, the Sun Devils jumped out to a 37-32 lead over the Trojans early in the second half. 
The Trojan offense went cold in the second half as the Sun Devils extended their lead to nine points with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Junior guard Julian Jacobs and sophomore guard Jordan McLaughlin led a spirited comeback that brought the Trojans within three points.
The Sun Devils ended the game on an 11-5 run and had an answer for everything USC threw at them. Goodman finished with 17 points and six rebounds off the bench and guard Gerry Blakes chipped in 14 points, eight rebounds, and five assists. 
“The amount of confidence coach had in me when was unbelievable,” Goodman said. “That is why I love him.”
USC entered the game averaging over 22 3-point attempts per game, but managed just one attempt in the first half. The Trojans finished just 2-11 from 3-point range, both makes from junior guard Katin Reinhardt. 
McLaughlin finished with 13 points, six assists, and two rebounds and Jacobs chipped in 12 points, four rebounds, and three assists. The backcourt duo showed great chemistry, linking up for an alley-oop dunk late in the second half. 
The Men of Troy continue to play dominant basketball at home, but once they leave the Galen Center, they look like a different team. The 67 points were a season low for the Trojans, who entered the game averaging an impressive 84 points per game. 
In their last three road games, which were all losses, the Trojans have been outscored by an average of 10 points per game.
Next up for the Trojans is a tough matchup against the Arizona Wildcats in Tucson. Tip-off is set for 5 P.M. this Sunday, and the game can be seen on Fox Sports 1.

My job is defined by more than the hours I work, but by the response of the USC community to the content I curate and the layout I create.
Every time I see another student reading the Daily Trojan I feel a sense of pride knowing that my work makes a difference. Providing USC students with news that matters to them is what makes the long, weekly slog worthwhile. 
I have been deputy news editor now for a month, and I can easily say this is one of the most demanding and rewarding roles I have had in my 19 years. It has forced me to lead others and, most importantly, it has forced me to learn more about myself. Whether it is organizing writers or learning the inner workings of InDesign and journalistic style, I gain experience that I can apply in my future endeavors and my own life.
If you need to see me the best place to look is in the Daily Trojan newsroom: it has become my second home. Every week I devote 30 hours to produce the daily newspaper.
My time in the newsroom has become a rhythm. By the end of my stint as deputy news editor, my mouse will become an extension of my body and the computer screen will become an extension of my eyes. Each day, I go straight to my computer in the back corner of the Daily Trojan newsroom and connect to the server — “Midnight” (quite a fitting name). I then determine the word count and photo dimensions of each story, layout the text, headlines, captions, second decks and photos, and place and write the content. My progression is dependent on everything going according to plan. That never happens so I have had to adapt to the newsroom environment.
As a deputy news editor, I must think on my feet in the face of adversity. Occasionally stories will come in late, reporters will be unresponsive or there will be a deadline event that starts during production. The variability of news forces my efficiency. I am constantly working against the clock so I must manage my time. If an event goes on during production, I work on captions and headlines; if a writer does not turn in their story, I find an alternative to help fill white space.
After being deputy news editor for one month, my fingers already subconsciously search for the backspace, shift and letter keys. I use my keyboard to shave away the stone and uncover a statue. After shaping the story on Google Drive, I add it to Trello, our task managing software, fix the managing editors’ comments and drop it in InCopy. Now the copy editors must begin the painstaking process of fact-checking every statistic and making sure each and every word fits cohesively. Finally the smoothened story is placed on the page.
My work is far from over now. The story may already be placed, but it is far from perfect. The other news editors and I then print the final version of the layout. We wait for the managing editors to read each page multiple times and use their multi-colored pens to perfect everything. This process is repeated twice. We’re still not done yet. 
We read the headlines, captions, ledes and decks aloud, we spell check everything that can be spelled and make sure every story finishes and jumps to the right page. 
The Daily Trojan has now transformed from a blank page in InDesign into a newspaper that I can feel proud of when I see students reading it.
Problem solving is a prerequisite if you want to be an successful deputy news editor. Be prepared to write less and design more. Be prepared to proactively mitigate issues before they become a problem. Most importantly, be prepared to take responsibility.
