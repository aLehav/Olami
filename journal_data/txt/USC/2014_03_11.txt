Monday night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting tackled budgetary issues within USG and determined which organizations on USG’s Program Board will receive additional funding this spring.
Treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom proposed an amendment to USG’s bylaws that would restructure the organization’s discretionary fund. The discretionary fund allocates USG funding to undergraduate student organizations on campus that do not fall under the umbrella of USG’s Program Board.
VanWoerkom said the fund has lost some of its discretion over the years, due to a flood of applications overwhelming board members.
“The discretionary fund comprises one-third of our Program Board funding,” VanWoerkom said. “They’ve been receiving four to six applications per week, and their meetings are taking longer than the one hour they are planned for.”
The discretionary fund received 121 expense requests this year, and more than 70 applications for funding. Under current USG bylaws, members of the discretionary board are unpaid. VanWoerkom believes the amount of work for these individuals is far too strenuous relative to their compensation.
“There can be lots of stress, particularly for the director and assistant director,” VanWoerkom said.
The proposed amendment will divide the discretionary fund in half. Instead of a single committee, the organization will split into two committees headed by two co-directors. Applications and proposals will be shared equally between the two committees, along with the same source of  USG funding.
The goal of this reorganization is to have each board process two to three applications per week, and for discussion to be more thoughtful and conversations with student organizations to be more productive.
“Conservations with student [organizations] can be time consuming [for the Discretionary Committee], but also very rewarding, as they help determine which organizations deserve funding,” VanWoerkom said.
The Senate will vote on the proposed amendment after spring break.
USG also voted on several funding requests. Notably, the Senate struck down a funding request from the Concerts Committee.
“The amount we’re able to give them is [too] small relative to the amount they need,” said Greek senator Nicole Schrad.
A Latino Student Assembly funding request was also denied and performing arts was partially funded. The Speakers Committee received funding on the condition they finalize their contract with high-profile speakers for the spring.

On Tuesday night, in the Town and Gown Ballroom, author Alexandra Fuller discussed her best-selling 2003 book, Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood, in a  Visions and Voices event.
Best-seller · Fuller shared with audience members her opinions on the value of free speech, applauding the United States’ for protecting that right. – Alison Brett | Daily Trojan
The work documents Fuller’s childhood in Rhodesia, current-day Zimbabwe, during the country’s struggle for independence. Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight explores the themes of war, love and death. Aside from Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, Fuller’s other nonfiction books include Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier, which won the Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage; The Legend of Colton H. Bryant and Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness.
Fuller has also written numerous articles in publications including  Harper’s, National Geographic Magazine, The New Yorker Magazine and Vogue.
Fuller’s Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight won the Royal Society of Literature’s Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for best regional novel of the year and became a finalist for Guardian’s First Book Award and a New York Times notable book.
At the event, Fuller described her childhood and compared it to her adulthood living and writing in the United States. She discussed the process of publishing Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight as well as her other three nonfiction books, which are also  memoirs.
Fuller argued that the meaning of freedom of speech in the United States by saying that though the Constitution grants the right to speak freely, the right can sometimes not be used. For this reason, Fuller said that people from Zimbabwe seem very outspoken.
“What I love is that my right not to lose my voice is protected,” Fuller said. “The U.S. gave me freedom of speech.”
Fuller said that people in the United States can be labeled — she gave the example of how knowing she is vegetarian or African-American can change the way people view her.
“Just because we are given freedom of speech doesn’t mean that we have an equal right to use it,” Fuller said.
On the subject of apartheid, Fuller said that people longs for a sense of power. Power in her childhood came from English speakers and though the movement seemed to be about gaining power, apartheid leaders did not achieve the goal in the end.
Fuller also spoke about the difficulty of being a female writer.
“Thank you for having me to speak,” Fuller said. “The statistics have shown how many women are being published and how many women are being reviewed … and the statistics are appalling.”
Students in attendance found the event moving.
“I thought it was great that she could talk about something so serious and intertwine bits of humor throughout. I’m really excited to read her book,”  said Taylor Andes, a junior majoring in biology.
Nikita Johri, a freshman majoring in cognitive science, thought that the author had interesting views on war.
“It was incredibly interesting to hear her opinions and her viewpoints on war, on humanity and on just her life experience after reading the book,” Johri said.
The night opened up to a question and answer session, which ranged from questions about Fuller’s opinions on war and the death penalty to appreciation for Fuller’s book from someone who grew up in Rhodesia in the audience.
A reception and book signing followed Fuller’s talk and the event, which was free to students. The planners gave the first 100 students a free copy of Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight.

Residential Student Government is one of the core organizations at USC. A branch under ResEd, RSG governs and supervises RAs, planning events and enhancing the on-campus residential  community — but none of this would be possible without the dedication of current RSG President Sera Choi.

Just last month, Choi was awarded President of the Year at a National Residence Hall conference for RSG, beating out schools all over the West coast. The conference, held at the University of La Verne, was rigorous, with hours of delegation and presentations on which school should win each of the several awards, including community of the year, school of the year and a collection of others.
Over the course of the semester, Choi has spearheaded sweeping changes in the structure of USC’s residential governing body, and it was her commitment to the program that made her stand out as a top candidate for the award.
“We really stepped it up this year in regards to representing students better,” Choi said.
To Choi, “stepping up” is nothing new. In addition to being the president of RSG, she also has a heavy extracurricular workload.
“I try to make time for other extracurricular activities like [the pre-med honor society] Alpha Epsilon Delta, clinical care externship and JEP,” Choi said. “I am also a research assistant in a neurogenetic lab at the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.”
Choi’s high school career was similarly busy, which led her right into RSG upon arrival at USC.
“I devoted most of my time to extracurricular activities that were either pre-med or service related,” Choi said. “Student government is something I have wanted to do since my sophomore year of high school, so I gave it my all once I got a chance in college.”
This is Choi’s third year in RSG, and she has been heavily involved in student government since first stepping on campus. Her freshman year, Choi ran and was successfully elected as the funding chair of Trojan Hall.
“I walked on campus and two weeks later I had a leadership position,” Choi said.
From there, she worked her way up through the ranks until she was elected president her junior year.
“She rebuilt the organization of the student government and made events like the highlighter dance a huge success,” said fellow RSG member Cooper Surrett of Choi.
If re-elected her senior year, Choi has already planned further beneficial changes, one of them being to unite the campus’ residence halls.
“I want to engage more of the residence hall governments to unify the school,” Choi said. “I want to take USC’s Residential Student Government to the national conference and bring back another School of the Year.”
Choi, along with three other USC RSG representatives, attended the conference unsure of the outcome. The RSG president noted that though USC seemed to be a favorite in the contest, there was tough competition and an intense voting process that put stress on the three representatives.
“During boardroom, we would meet three times a day for around six hours each time,” Choi said.
For individual awards, a member of the student’s governing body had to submit a proposal detailing why the candidate was the best choice. Michael Tong, the National Residence Hall Honorary president, took up the task.
Tong stressed Choi’s merits, and how she delved into her position as president from the beginning.
“Sera Choi moved to L.A. in the summer and met with ResEd weekly to set up the organization before school started,” Tong said. “I knew right away she was going to kill it.”
At the end of the conference, an awards banquet was thrown to announce the winners, and though the entire team was excited to win School of the Year, Choi was even more excited as she was able to see her work truly pay off.
“We used to win awards years ago, but we hadn’t been recognized in a while. It feels good to put USC back on the radar,” Choi said.

The Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities and the California Students First Alliance have created a petition to stop cuts in the Cal Grant funding system. 
The petition, which went live on Feb. 28, aims to garner at least 10,000 supporters. Currently, the petition has received more than 2,000 signatures.
The effort was triggered by a proposed 11 percent cut in the maximum aid for income-based students in the 2014-15 school year, or from $9,084 to $8,056. This would be the third consecutive cut in aid in as many years for private college students.
Though the majority of the aid goes to public school students in the University of California system, the program currently provides assistance to 33,000 private college students per year.
Costs for the Cal Grant program have been on the rise, however, with 2014’s projected cost at $1.8 billion,  Diana Fuentes-Michel said, executive director of the California Student Aid Commission, the organization that administers Cal Grant aid.
The potential cuts would have a direct impact on USC students who are current recipients of the funds, such as Karen Arcos, a junior majoring in psychology.
“Lowering the Cal Grant would increase my expected family contribution for my senior year,” Arcos said. “The costs of an undergraduate education are already increasing, so the last thing students receiving financial aid need is a decrease in available state aid.”
Sarah Schwartz, a sophomore majoring in public relations and visual and performing arts studies, signed the petition last week and discussed how grants have helped her educational and professional pursuits thus far.
“[Grants have] allowed me to attend a university where I am able to pursue my career interests,” Schwartz said. “Without grants, I don’t think I would have been able to complete, or even begin, my studies at USC. Having been raised by a single mother in a low-income household, grants that I have received are a huge part of the reason why I have been able to be a student at USC.”
Schwartz elaborated that reducing Cal Grant funding would pose an unnecessary challenge in education.
“Lowering Cal Grant funding would hurt current and future students by putting an obstacle in their path of education and hindering their plans to graduate on time,” Schwartz said.
The Cal Grant funding program began in 1955 as a means to provide scholarships to those attending private colleges only. Once the University of California started to charge fees in the early 1990s as a result of economic recession and fiscal deficits, however, the program was expanded to public college students as well.
Today, demand for the award is at record levels with the California Student Aid Commission reporting 383,948 participants in this past year alone. With a recent budget surplus in California, along with a  voter-approved tax increase from this past election season, many on the outside are left to question the idea of cutting educational spending during a time of increased tax revenue.
Veronica Villalobos Cruz, vice president of external relations at AICCU, discussed a previous year’s petition that the group also co-sponsored.
“In 2012, Gov. Jerry Brown proposed a 44 percent reduction to the Cal Grant award,” Cruz wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “AICCU utilized [a petition from Change.org] and it was effective in getting students to participate in large numbers and policymakers were very aware that the proposed 44 percent would have dismantled the intent of the Cal Grant program. During this time, AICCU had over 10,000 petitions electronically delivered to the state house by March of 2012.”
Will Shuck, spokesman for Democrat Assembly Speaker and California State Controller John Perez, said that the assemblyman was working toward improving the Cal Grant.
“We are working to improve Cal Grants and access to higher education,” Shuck said. “We will continuing looking at specific proposals and options as the budget process progresses.”
The petition can be found on the website Change.org and is addressed to Perez.

For the fifth year in a row, USC has been ranked the number one school for game design at the graduate level by the Princeton Review. Additionally, the ranking marks the fourth year that the undergraduate program has been distinguished with the honor.
The ranking was released Tuesday morning. USC’s program is a joint effort between the Interactive Media and Games Division of the School of Cinematic Arts and the computer science department with a games emphasis in the Viterbi School of Engineering. Students can earn either a Bachelor of Arts or Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Cinematic Arts, or either a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science degree from Viterbi through the program.
Michael Zyda, a professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering’s computer science department and director of the GamePipe Laboratory at USC Games, credits much of the success of the organization to the collaboration between the two departments.
“Cinema and engineering programs mashed together — that’s what’s excellent,” Zyda said. “The game industry right now is three times larger than the film industry, and in five years it’s going to be five times larger than the film industry. Hopefully by then, USC will have a school of games.”
Another unique aspect of the program is that students have the opportunity to work on large-scale projects throughout the course of the year. Some of these groups consist of almost 40 students, said Graham Hawes, a senior majoring in computer science with an emphasis in games.
“As the projects get bigger, they become more ambitious, and with bigger teams of people they can accomplish many things and students can participate in these big projects at least once if not two or three times,” he said.
Hawes said he switched from the pre-med track to games after his sophomore year and has not looked back since. He contributed to the engineering aspect of the The Maestros game for one of his major projects.
Another aspect of the program that Hawes enjoys is the professionalism of the staff and faculty.
“A lot of the staff and faculty are professionals in the field which is better than if they had been in academia for the last 10 years because they have more experience,” Hawes said.
Ebonka Agboje, a freshman majoring in computer science with an emphasis in gaming, shared similar sentiments to Hawes’. He said he has been nothing but impressed with the program since coming to USC this year.
“USC pools the biggest names that I can imagine for its staff and faculty and I realize why they are the number one program in America — because they offer things that no other school is doing,” Agboje said.
Ida Abhari contributed to this report.

USC students are often plagued by a dire craving for a burrito that obviously only Chipotle can satisfy. Sure, the location is just barely southeast of campus, but who has time to walk that far? 
Thanks to a new website by freshmen Chad Massura and Anthony Zhang, Envoy, which launched last Friday, hungry students no longer have to settle for the typical LA Café order. For just a $3 delivery fee, Envoy customers can enjoy Chick-fil-a, Chipotle and Panda Express at just the click of a button.
Upon joining the USC community, Zhang, a business administration major, and Massura, a business cinematic arts major, were determined to create a startup that would serve campus.
“When Anthony and I started rooming together last semester, we decided, ‘Okay, if we don’t come up with a really cool idea for a business, this year is a failure,’” Massura said. “We literally would chill in our room in New/North for countless nights just bouncing off ideas.”
Around November, the duo’s brainstorming finally paid off.
“We were just hanging out, sick of EVK food and nearby delivery and dying for some Chipotle,” Zhang said. “Wishing that they delivered, it hit us. We could do that, and the concept of Envoy was born.”
This project engrossed the two over winter break and by the time they returned for the spring semester, Envoy was well on its way. The two hosted an information session in January, publicized only through social media and word of mouth.
“It was great to see so many people on campus were interested in our idea,” Zhang said. “We only posted in Facebook groups like the ‘Class of 2017,’ and we left the info session with a ton of students interested in delivering for us.”
Envoy’s business model emulates that of the car service Uber to accommodate the hours of the students who would likely deliver food for the company. Deliverers create their own hours and only pick up jobs when they want to earn some money. The $3 delivery charge (plus tips) goes straight to those who deliver the food, while the founders earn a profit to maintain the company through commission earned in partnership with the restaurants. Massura and Zhang chose this kind of setup to offer students a flexible job that can work with any schedule.
“Though I joked earlier that this year is a failure if we didn’t come up with an idea, it’s slightly true,” Massura said. “Anthony and my main purpose in creating a business is to make a company that can help the USC community. Envoy offers both delicious food right at your door, and a convenient job for anyone to have, and we think that’s pretty profound.”
As of its launch on Friday, Envoy has had more than 35 deliverers sign up to work for the startup. Envoy decided to start small, delivering only to Marks Hall, Marks Tower, New/ North Residential College, Pardee Tower and Trojan Hall, and the two founders are using the first few days to test out demand and work out any kinks in its structure.
The response from customers was double what they had expected. Saturday night, Envoy posted a promising comment on its Facebook page: “Demand has been so off the charts during dinner, we’re pretty sure the kind folk at Chipotle, Chick-Fil-A and Panda Express know our names already.”
If this success continues, the duo have big plans for the future. Envoy plans on expanding its delivery services to more of the USC community to cover the entire University Park Campus,  including locations such as Lorenzo Student Apartments, The Row, University Gateway and West 27th University Place in the months to come. In addition, the company is reaching out to their current customers to see what other restaurants they want to see on the Envoy website.
Currently, Envoy only takes orders from its website, but the company is hoping to create an app that can improve service. Ideas on how to expand its business, such as delivery tracking similar to that of tracking Ubers, are also in the works. As for the future of Envoy, the founders hope to expand the app’s capabilities to “where a student can order exactly what they want from any restaurant on campus with a few simple taps, be able to track their food being prepared and delivered to them and not have to ever deal with cash or even credit cards during the entire process.”
For now, however, Massura and Zhang are taking in the initial success and planning the future of Envoy one-step at a time.
“The fact that an idea we’ve been talking about on our bunk in New North for months is now realized is so awesome,” Zhang said. “We have big hopes for Envoy, and the overwhelming support makes us hopeful for its future.”

Spring break is less than a week away, so students are starting to get a small taste of what freedom is like along with the pressure of having to cram for midterms. I don’t know about everyone else, but I am also cramming to clean out my fridge so that nothing goes to waste — thus, I have been making a slew of random concoctions to feed myself. I call this week “Leftovers Week.”
Hey, ho, pesto! · Blogs are a great place to look for recipe inspiration when dealing with leftovers. Take, for example, a mozzarella pesto-stuffed chicken breast from the blog “Two Peas and Their Pod” (pictured). – Photo courtesy of Two Peas and Their Pod
A few days ago, I made stuffing on a whim — old bread baked with chicken broth, celery, raisins, some pine nuts and a few homey spices. My hasty decision and Thanksgiving-sized recipe left me with way more than I could finish. I did not know what to do with it and I certainly did not want it to go to waste, so I searched all over the web in hopes of finding some way to use the stuffing. But instead, my friend Elena found something and shared it with me — Leftover Stuffing and Chorizo Egg Cups by the food blog “Uni Homemaker.” Upon finding this, I got really excited because I looked in my fridge and realized that I had every ingredient — being half Mexican, I purchase beef chorizo by the pounds. I eagerly pulled the ingredients together, took out my canola oil spray and remembered that I did not own a cupcake pan. As unfortunate as this was, I am sharing this find with Daily Trojan readers in hopes that this Thanksgiving-esque snack will suit their fancy anytime.
I love experimenting with food — it’s a thing that I do a little too much. Sometimes, I also make more than there needs to be (which is always great for my friends — free food). My experimental parsley pesto is one of these things. Granted, I am not the largest fan of parsley, preferring cilantro and basil, but before, I do not like wasting food, so I had to figure out with to do with it. The food blog “Two Peas and Their Pod” came to the rescue with an inspiring recipe for Mozzarella Pesto-Stuffed Chicken Breasts that I morphed into Parmesan Parsley Pesto Stuffed Chicken Breasts. This was a real treat to make and it made me feel like a real gourmet chef, plus my Instagram was blowing up with likes so I guess it looked good too.
Leftovers are always really tricky to deal with. I know that whenever my refrigerator gets down to almost empty, all I have left is condiments. Here’s what I say: When life give you condiments, make more condiments. Soy sauce, for example, can be easily turned into savory Teriyaki sauce by just putting some over a flame and slowly stirring in sugar. If you want to try an “international condiment,” take the extra mayo from your fridge, add some fries and boom, that is how they eat their French fries in the Netherlands.
Leftovers are great if the food was originally fabulous, otherwise you can make them into something else, like my Parmesan Parsley Pesto-Stuffed Chicken Breasts or the Leftover Stuffing and Chorizo Egg Cups. The good leftovers are almost always better the next day. I encourage you to cook your way to victory, USC. Spring break is so close all you need to do is eat your way there.

Eating healthy should not be stressful and overly complicated. Urban Garden, a Lebanese kitchen located on Beverly Boulevard, strikes an ideal balance between food that is satisfying, flavorful and nutritious. The kitchen uses local and sustainable produce and meats to create modern iterations of traditional Middle Eastern cuisine.
Spice up your life · Urban Garden, a new Lebanese kitchen on Beverly Boulevard, offers Middle Eastern dishes with fresh, free range ingredients. The Middle Eastern kitchen offers a bright and friendly ambiance and the dishes are tasteful, delicious and healthy. – Photo courtesy of Urban Garden
These high-quality products transform seemingly simple recipes into standout dishes.
Take hummus, for example. Because this classic chickpea spread contains just a handful of ingredients, it is difficult to distinguish a superb version from a mediocre one. Urban Garden offers a hummus bar, with flavors such as sundried tomato and basil and eggplant, along with a variety of toppings including warm feta cheese and fried cauliflower.
The “old-fashioned way” hummus, simply drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with toasted cumin and paprika, possessed a silky smooth texture, so delicate that it nearly melted on my tongue. The aromatic spices and fruity olive oil are not decorative extras, but exceptional in and of themselves. Each hummus comes with a side of house-made lavash, a thin, paper-like bread, ideal for dipping.
Urban Garden offers other Middle Eastern staples, such as tabbouleh, a salad consisting of finely minced parsley, diced tomatoes, onions and bulgur. As with all the menu items, the tabbouleh was fresh and light, and slightly tart from the lemony dressing.
For its Chicken Shawarma wrap, the kitchen sources free-range chickens from a farm with high animal welfare standards. The chicken is marinated, sliced thin and cooked on a rotating spit for several hours. This method yields tender, juicy meat, which is then layered with lettuce, tomato and onions, doused with a creamy tahini sauce and wrapped in lavash.
The sandwich would have been sublime if not for the overpowering flavor of red onions and garlic. Luckily, the house-made rose water lemonade helps neutralize the palate. Subtly sweet, the smooth, floral rose water complemented the lemons’ acidity.
In addition to quick, light fare, Urban Garden offers a pleasant ambience and comfortable indoor and outdoor seating.
Natural light pours into the quaint space, which is extremely clean and well-organized. The open kitchen invites customers to watch their food being made, emphasizing Urban Garden’s pride in its products and the integrity with which the dishes are prepared.
A vibrantly colored mural enlivens one wall of the kitchen. The mural contains iconic images from Lebanese magazines, along with a spray-painted portrait of the mother of Urban Garden’s owner.
Friendly, efficient service further enhances the experience. The cashier patiently answered any questions about the menu and even shared additional information about the restaurant’s history and its ethos towards cooking. Handouts scattered on each table details where Urban Garden sources its products, satisfying the most serious locavores.
Urban Garden is located at 7563 Beverly Blvd. Open daily, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Easing its way back into the live gig scene after years off the road, British pop/rock group the Kooks played two back-to-back sets at the Troubadour Monday night. With new music set to be released this week, the shows offered fans an intimate look into what to expect from its upcoming record.

Tucked away among the bars, clubs and eclectic restaurants of West Hollywood, the Troubadour offered fans a great location and one of the most intimate venue experiences to be found in Los Angeles. For a sold-out show such as the Kooks, fans can expect to wait in a line that wraps around the block regardless of when they arrive. Truly hardcore fans were camped out hours in advance to be able to secure spots as close to the stage as possible.
The venue might have seemed too small to house a band of the Kooks’ caliber, but once inside, the Troubadour truly delivered. The size of the space is just cozy enough that there is a fantastic view of the stage regardless of where one stands. The floor is open for those who enjoy the close quarters that come with general admission territory, but there is also an elevated balcony to escape the crowd and enjoy a bird’s eye view of your favorite band.
The Kooks rocked two sold-out shows at 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. for two separate audiences. Tickets were scalped in the line outside for as much as $100 more than face value.
Teenage girls comprised the majority of the crowd, which was undoubtedly sprinkled with tag-along boyfriends and a surprising number of people who were able to get 21+ wristbands. Shrieking harpies aside, Monday was a night of enjoyable, funky rock music.
Local Los Angeles-based group the Futures League lackadaisically tuned and chilled onstage before opening the show with a surprisingly mature psychedelic rock set. A blend of Tame Impala vocal styling with groovy bass and keyboard action, Futures League put on a high-amplitude set running through a string of original tunes. It was clear that the majority of the young crowd had its sights set on the Kooks, but if the Futures League’s talent wasn’t enough to win over the crowd’s heart, the band’s unexpected and first-ever live performance of Outkast’s “Hey Ya!” enticed the reluctant audience to sing along.
Under dimmed lights and shattering screams, the Kooks took the stage around 9:15 p.m. The band’s set consisted of a solid mix of its three albums: 2006’s Inside In/Inside Out, 2008’s Konk and 2011’s Junk of the Heart. The audience was unabashed by its diehard fandom with every song being considered a fan favorite. Classic Kooks hits such as “Seaside” and “Ooh La” were hardly audible over the noise of the crowd. Fans took it upon themselves to sing along to almost every song. It was quite apparent that the crowd was there to be with the band and interact with its members more than to explore the Kooks’ personal expression.
The Kooks treated the packed Troubadour to a few new additions to their repertoire, including “Down,” which was premiered on BBC Radio 1 this Tuesday. It has been about three years since the Kooks’ last release, so their new music was especially exciting. In true Kooks style, the new tracks were surely recognizable with lead singer Luke Pritchard’s thick accent and emotive voice. The new releases, including the venue-thumping “Bad Habit,” however, showcased a much groovier, bass-heavy and syncopated structure indicative of a band that seems to be growing up — despite its fanbase consisting mostly of high schoolers.
Pritchard put on quite the performance for his teen fans. At age 29, he could still easily be mistaken for a late teens/early 20s college student, which played to his advantage. Neither Pritchard’s vocals nor his energy wavered. Not only was he engaged with his fellow band mates on stage, but he was in constant control of the crowd. Everyone ate up his stage presence and welcomed him to stand atop monitors along the lip of the stage, if for no other reason than to say they touched his pants or made eye contact with him. But fans weren’t the only ones showing intense affection. The crowd, surely louder than the band’s own monitors, were complimented by Pritchard. “Maybe you should all go on X Factor!” One muffled yell among the crowd replied, “How? It’s cancelled!”
The roughly hour long set was kept to a tight schedule because of the following 11 p.m. performance. The Kooks ended with one of their biggest hits, “Naïve,” leaving the audience feeling fulfilled. After hearing some favorites, some new songs and finally the last note of “Naïve” was presented in a beautiful harmony, the teenage shrieks might have been worth it in the end.
It was an intimate night at the Troubadour with the Kooks. Their tour continues throughout the summer when they will perform at both the Bråvalla Festival in Sweden and the Osheaga Festival in Montreal.

The USC men’s basketball team will try to channel some magic from the Pac-12 Champion Women of Troy as they head into their own conference tournament. 
USC (11-20, 2-16 Pac-12), by virtue of being the last place team in the conference, will square off against the 5th-seeded Colorado Buffaloes (21-10, 10-8). Colorado finished in a five-way tie for third place in the conference, but was bumped down to the seventh spot due to a series of tiebreakers. The top four teams (Arizona, UCLA, Arizona State and Cal) received a first round bye.
Colorado was led in scoring by guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who injured his ACL in a game against Washington earlier this year and has missed most of the season’s second half. 
Guard Askia Booker has picked up the slack for the Buffaloes, averaging 13.7 points per game in Dinwiddie’s absence. The L.A. native has been helped by frontcourt duo Josh Scott and Xavier Johnson, who are averaging 14.5 and 12.2 points per game, respectively. Scott also leads the team in rebounds with an average of 8.8 boards per game.
The Trojans and Buffaloes squared off twice this season, with USC coming up short in both contests. The most recent time the two teams matched up, played while the Trojans were in the midst of a 10-game losing streak, the Trojans came up just short at the end, falling 83-74.
In that game, like so many others this season, junior guard Byron Wesley was one of the sole bright spots for Andy Enfield’s squad, scoring 21 points to go along with his eight rebounds.
On Monday, the Pac-12 first, second and honorable mention teams were announced and Wesley was not among those who were honored.
This is an unfortunate trend in Wesley’s career, partly from playing on underachieving teams at USC. As a freshman in 2012, Wesley was left off the all-freshman team despite averaging more points than four of the seven freshman honored and more rebounds than all but one.
Still, Wesley and his squad will have a chance at revenge if they are able to shock the world and make a run at the conference tournament. A win over Colorado, no easy task, would pit them against a Cal team that the Trojans defeated at the Galen Center in their most impressive performance of the season. USC also played the Bears tough on the road, falling 77-64 only after Cal went on a 11-0 run in the second half.
The Trojans are coming off the momentum of a rare weekend split, as they beat the Washington State Cougars last Thursday in Pullman. Wesley tied his career high with 31 points in that contest.
USC followed that with a loss to the Washington Huskies on Saturday, to finally end what was a disappointing regular season in Troy.
Though the Trojans might be able to compete on Wednesday, a victory over a 21-win Colorado team seems unlikely. If USC loses, it would be the end of one of the worst campaigns in recent memory.
The teams play at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow in Las Vegas’ MGM Garden Arena.

Former USC outside linebacker and defensive end Morgan Breslin isn’t the type to do much talking. In my first time covering the USC Trojans spring camp last season, I was excited about the opportunity to meet and interview the players. I was tasked with doing a preview of the Trojans’ new defensive schemes under then-defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, so I kept an eye on the front seven, which had been a point of emphasis in Pendergast’s spread-stopping schemes at Cal.
A couple of the players stood out. One, of course, was 6-foot-5, 290-pound lineman Leonard Williams. The then-sophomore was swallowing up entire sections of the Trojans’ hapless offensive line, breaking through blocks and exhibiting the sound technique that would end with him earning First Team All-American honors at the end of last season.
The other player was a little bit quieter, but similarly lethal. He attacked from the outside and put immense pressure on the quarterback, oftentimes changing the direction of the offense and forcing a check down or a throwaway. So at the end of practice, when USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone came by with his pen and notepad to ask the media which players they’d like to interview, one number stuck out in my mind.
“Defense, 91,” I said. The request drew a couple funny looks from the group I was standing with, and I regretted it immediately after I said it. The reason?
“Breslin doesn’t do interviews,” Tessalone said, who gave me the look of someone explaining an ages-old office policy.
It was something I knew — but I forgot. But really, 13 sacks, 19.5 tackles for loss and 32.5 stuffs in his first year starting as a junior and no one gets to talk to him? Then the 2013 season came, and Breslin battled injuries all season. But Breslin, the consummate teammate, fought on — until he sustained a sports hernia, partially as a result of playing on the injury.
Breslin missed all but five games in the 2013 season, and was on pace for another season with double-digit sacks, despite playing with excruciating pain. Then came hip surgery for the sports hernia, which effectively ended his season — and with it, his USC career.
Last month was the NFL Combine, a chance for the nation to see that Breslin had fully recovered from surgery and was ready to become a pass-rushing asset at the professional level. Out of 20 outside linebackers who were invited to participate in Indianapolis, Breslin wasn’t one of them. He was considered one of the biggest snubs at the combine — and the infamously reticent Trojan finally spoke up, in a phone interview with FoxSports.
“I honestly think I should’ve got an invite to the combine,” Breslin said. “I was pretty pissed about that.”
If you ask any of Breslin’s teammates or his coaches, the former junior college transfer is the last person to feel a sense of entitlement about anything. His silence is, as advertised, a product of his humility. No single player embodied former head coach Lane Kiffin’s mantra of “Don’t talk about it, be about it” quite like Breslin. But after he had turned in one of the most statistically impressive defensive seasons for the Trojans in over a decade, Breslin’s injury-riddled 2013 campaign had pushed him out of the national spotlight. Here was the player who had terrorized Pac-12 offenses in his first year as a starter, and then one year later, no one was talking to him.
Eight Trojans will take Loker Field today at 10 a.m. for USC’s Pro Day. None stands to gain more than Breslin, who has been projected by some scouts as a fifth-round pick and a top-15 player at his position by NFLDraftScout and CBS Sports — all without a combine appearance.
What NFL scouts should expect to see is Breslin’s uncanny precision and skill in getting past linemen. Breslin isn’t the most athletic outside linebacker, but his defensive instincts and intangibles are exceptional. During the Trojans’ 2012 season, Breslin routinely drew double coverage from offensive linemen, and his reaction times and ball-awareness more than compensated for his lack of explosive athleticism. His unrelenting play and stand-up instincts have led to countless instances where Breslin will overcome an offensive lineman by misdirection.
Another asset which may go unnoticed is Breslin’s strong center of gravity: At a relatively compact 6-foot-2, 250 pounds, Breslin often presents a challenge to opposing linemen who rely on leverage and sheer strength to secure blocks.
Of course, scouts and members of the media will have to actually see Breslin in action and draw their own conclusions, and they will finally get that chance today. But those who want to hear how impressive Breslin is might have to hear it from someone else — something tells me Breslin’s going to let his play do all the talking.

The USC men’s golf team used a late surge at the Lamkin Grips San Diego Classic to overtake co-host San Diego State and take home its first team victory of the season. The No. 23 Trojans shot a scorching 8-under during yesterday’s final round, putting them at 12-under for the tournament. The Aztecs finished seven strokes behind USC, followed by Wake Forest and Michigan.

After Monday’s 36-hole marathon the Trojans were in striking distance, trailing San Diego State by only two strokes. USC duplicated its first round score of 2-under in the second round, while the Aztecs’ strong first round 5-under was enough to hold on to the lead at the par-72 San Diego CC in Chula Vista, Calif.
Freshman Rico Hoey and senior Jeffrey Kang posted strong scores during the first two rounds of play, keeping their team in the hunt. Hoey’s second-round 69 was especially helpful, as it was just one of two under-par scores the Trojans managed in that round. The other was a 2-under 70 from junior Anthony Paolucci.
USC’s spectacular third-round performance was a true team effort, as was the entire event. Each of the four Trojans that contributed their scores to the final standings finished the tournament in 11th place or higher. Leading the charge was Hoey, who added a second sub-70 effort with a 67 in the third round. The Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. native finished second on the individual leaderboard, best on his team.
San Diego State’s Xander Schauffele captured the individual title with an 11-under par on the tournament, two strokes ahead of Hoey. Fortunately for USC, Schauffele’s teammates failed to rally behind his inspiring performance. Aside from Nahum Mendoza III, no other Aztec managed under a 75 in the final round.
Junior Eric Sugimoto was USC’s second-best finisher at 2-under, good for a sixth place tie. Sugimoto bookended a 2-over 74 with 70s in the opening and closing rounds. The transfer from Pacific came into the event as the team’s fourth-seeded player. Kang finished tied for eighth place, a stroke behind Sugimoto at 1-under. The team captain was consistent throughout the tournament, stringing together scores of 71, 73 and 71. Paolucci, the Trojans’ No. 1 seed, struggled in Monday’s first round with a 2-over 74. The junior, who is coming off of his first career win at the Jones Sports Invitational, bounced back with scores of 70 and 72 in the final two rounds, finishing in a tie for 11th place.
After his team fell to San Diego State by just one stroke at the its last event, head coach Chris Zambri praised his team’s performance yesterday and acknowledged Hoey’s exceptional performance.
“We are all very excited and happy to get a win. It never gets old to win,” Zambri said. “Everyone played well in today’s final round, but Rico Hoey stood out with a fine 67. He played great.”
Wake Forest attempted to surpass both the Trojans and the Aztecs during yesterday’s final round, but the team ended up three strokes behind the Aztecs to capture third.
Freshman Danny Guise of the Demon Deacons posted a 5-under 67 for the low score of the final round, tying Hoey, Schauffele and Alex Franklin of Oregon State. The Pac-12 rival Beavers failed to rally behind Franklin’s strong final round, finishing in sixth place.
The promising finish by the Trojans will certainly help them as they travel to Stanford Golf Club in Palo Alto, Calif., where they will face off against No. 8 Stanford in two weeks. After finishing 24-strokes behind the Cardinal three weeks ago at The Prestige at PGA West, the team hopes to build on its most recent performances as it goes up against some of the toughest competitors in the nation.

It’s almost spring, but spring football is  officially up and running for new head coach Steve Sarkisian and the USC football team, as they held their first practice on Tuesday at Howard Jones Field.
And as expected, the practice went a lot faster than it did under the team’s previous regimes. Of course, Sarkisian brings from Washington a high-tempo, no-huddle offense that is new to USC players.

This style may have been foreign to the Trojans, but that was not reflected in the way they came out to play on Tuesday. The team brough out the intensity and focus that is desired by any coach.
“It didn’t really feel like a first practice,” Sarkisian said. “The guys came out with great energy today and our players were ready, in the right frame of mind to practice.”
Today marked the first time Sarkisian ran onto to Howard Jones Field as USC’s head coach.
“All in all, it was awesome coming through the gate and coaching these guys … I had a blast,” Sarkisian said.
Installing Speed and Tempo 
If you were to ask any USC player if there was anything different about practice on Tuesday, they would say that Sarkisian did not waste any time.
According to redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, the offense ran 125 plays in the hour and 45 minutes time allotment, a great deal more than in the Kiffin or Orgeron eras.  He described that this type of up tempo offense makes it easier for a quarterback in certain situations.
“Getting the plays now is easier, I’m not reading off my wristband and there is a lot more time on the play clock when I snap the ball,” Kessler said.
A big question coming into spring ball, for the second consecutive year, is who will win the USC starting quarterback job once the spring is over: Kessler or redshirt freshman Max Browne. Kessler is the incumbent, but Sarkisian, having recruited Browne from Skyline High School in Washington knows what he can do with his arm. Look to this position battle for Sark’s first real important decision.
“I’m just trying to get better every practice,” Kessler said.
For now, Sarkisian is just focused on making sure that his team plays up to the quick tempo that he has installed.
He shared a motto: “If you’re walking, then you’re doing it wrong.” He continuously praised veteran linebacker Hayes Pullard for leading by example and being the first guy to every drill.
Even Sark was all over the field, engaging with his players, clapping and giving them encouragement, and getting on the field to spot the ball to speed up the pace of play.
“It was a lot of plays,” offensive lineman Max Tuerk said.
Changes on the Line 
Returning junior Tuerk slid down from his left tackle to make the start at center in the spring’s first practice, a position that needed to be filled with the departure of last year’s starter, Marcus Martin.
Tuerk returns with the most starts of any offensive lineman with 20 career starts and is considered the Trojan’s most versatile lineman.
“It’s best for the team, I’m a big team player, and I’m willing to do whatever the team needs,” Tuerk said. “If the team needs me to play center, then I will play center.”
According to Tuerk, offensive line coach Tim Drevno notified him of the position change about a month ago.
Tuerk had previously given the center position a shot last spring before Martin assumed the position’s roles. Things have changed since then though, he asserted.
“I have a lot more confidence now and we are picking up the offense,” Tuerk said.
Questions still remain on the offensive line, however, as someone is still needed to replace Kevin Graf at right tackle.
“We had to move guys around … Max Tuerk is playing center and has taken a leadership role,” Kessler said about the offensive line in an interview with ESPN.
Quick Takes 
Five-star USC signee Adoree’ Jackson was at practice today, but it remains unknown where the coaching staff will utilize him in the fall. Top 2015 quarterback and verbal commit Ricky Town was also in attendance.
Sarkisian confirmed that defensive end Leonard Williams had his shoulder cleaned up following the bowl game and will be limited in practice. Josh Shaw has a stress fracture in his foot, was in a walking boot and will also be limited.
Justin Davis, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury during an impressive freshman campaign, only participated in walk-throughs, along with a few other injured players.
Wide receivers George Farmer, a redshirt junior and Steven Mitchell, a redshirt freshman, were back in action on Tuesday. Farmer was patient when discussing his injury.
“I am going to be participating in no-contact drills,” Farmer said. “So, we’ll see how that goes from here. For now, we don’t have any pads on, so I’m trying to get the routes down [and] the plays going. We’ll move forward as spring goes on, but right now I’m participating in no-contact drills.”
Farmer claimed his knee was currently at 85 percent.
With a new style of play, injuries, and the constant pressure to win surrounding the program, it appears that Sarkisian has a lot of questions left to answer this spring.

“Isn’t it dangerous there?” “Have you ever seen anyone get killed?” “Are you sure you want to go back?” “How do you survive?”
These are just some examples of the countless questions we receive when we tell someone that the Democratic Republic of Congo is a place we call home. Sometimes, it comes from ignorance; sometimes, it comes as a joke. Yet no one understands how hurtful it is to know that more than half of the world believes we live in a war zone. Especially considering the fact that we don’t.
There is no denying the mass violence that is indeed taking place in DRC and we are in no way trying to say that it should be condoned. We thoroughly understand the brutality more than anyone else because it hits so close to home. We know people who have been affected by the situation; moreover, we even know people who were around when the civil war occurred during the ’90s.
The only thing we ask is that everyone get his or her facts straight. The genocide that is taking place is focused in one region: eastern Congo. To an outsider, it might not seem like a big deal, but this key point matters more than you can imagine.
Today, USC STAND and the Political Student Assembly will be coming together to present “Come Out for Congo — The Rally.” Currently, there are already more than 100 students who have RSVP’d to the event on Facebook and more than 1000 students have been invited to join. The event plans to discuss how increasing the accountability of raw materials bought from the country (mostly to be used in technology) can “make a huge impact in reducing violence against Congolese citizens caught in the middle of the struggle.”
Now let us explain why this is not helping the cause. According to the BBC, three of the main exports of DRC are diamonds, copper and cobalt. The increase in the restrictions on buying raw materials from the country and the increased accountability requirements — which lead to an increase in cost or corruption — are not reducing the violence in eastern Congo. What it is doing, however, is greatly reducing foreign direct investment and employment while making it extremely difficult for those in the mining industry to continue to find foreign buyers.
Though trying to increase accountability of the raw materials is a justified idea, most don’t realize the negative repercussions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has declared DRC as a conflict zone and many countries refuse to purchase material from there. Increasing accountability costs have caused companies in north, south, west and central Congo to reduce production, let go of some of their workforce and not be able to contribute as much to society.
Also, it is not well-known that the genocide in districts such as Goma, which is in eastern Congo, are mainly caused by rebels from the bordering country of Rwanda. This is due to land dispute issues as well as tribal rivalries between the two countries. It is surprising to us that the event is not informing students on this important matter. There are several factors that have led up to the violence. We feel, however, that the workshops the event has to offer do not cover most factors apart from technology.
One of the reasons we decided to come to USC was because we loved that it had such a high population of international students. We thought it would provide us with a community that was more understanding. Seeing this event broke our hearts. Knowing that now even more people would not get the right message, that more people would believe that the entire country was in turmoil, is absolutely devastating.
DRC is our home. We are proud of the advancements it has made and the development we have seen. We want to stand together with others in fighting the genocide in eastern Congo, but we need everyone to understand increasing accountability and adding restrictions to trade is not going to solve the issue, it will only lead to a strain in the rest of the country.

Every person deserves a chance, and some even deserve to have a head start in the right direction. With recent cuts to the federal program Head Start that provides underprivileged children with instructional preschool, however, the chance to rise out of cyclical poverty through education might be taken away. In the current climate of the country — from income inequality to the nation’s comparatively low-ranking public education — we are in need of Head Start programs now more than ever.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 “War on Poverty” initiative led to the creation of Head Start, a program that promotes school readiness for children in low-income families until the age of 5, according to the Office of Head Start website. The program tackles many social issues that serve as barriers to a child’s education by providing health services, language and literacy courses and emphasizing the role of the parent in the learning process.
Fifty years later, rather than the “War on Poverty” effectively tackling the causes of poverty, it has instead been attacked through lack of funding. In August 2013, the Head Start program experienced the worst financial cuts to the program since its inception. As a result of the scaled-back budget, the program made the decision to cut services to 57,000 students, according to the Washington Post. The budget cuts also led to more than 18,000 employees being laid off and the amount of time students will spend in the school year was shortened.
These cuts will resonate across all states and reach all pockets of the nation. More than one million children are involved in Head Start programs, according to the Office of Head Start. The races of children involved are as diverse as the regions from which they live. According to the National Head Start Association, 40 percent of the children are Caucasian, 29 percent are African American and 36 percent are Latino. The cuts to Head Start are a cross-cultural issue.
The federal government’s decision to cut back Head Start programs is already beginning to have a major effect on operations — especially in California. Approximately 30 Head Start programs in Los Angeles, with many located in South Los Angeles around USC’s University Park Campus, are expected to close for good, according to the Los Angeles Times. This comes as a result of the termination of contracts between large community centers and the Los Angeles County Office of Education in January. In both California and Texas, approximately 10,000 children will have their early education services cut, according to the Washington Post.
Though most people do not remember their preschool years, we must keep in mind that early childhood education is essential to the country’s future. An educated workforce keeps the country moving forward. Many studies over the half-century have shown that early education can only help a child.
Yet the Head Start program has not thrived in its ideal concept. Since its beginning, the program has been plagued with fraud, and politics have sometimes gotten in the way of providing quality education to every child who goes through the program. In Congress, some argue that the government should not distribute such large sums of money to a preschool program. Though the program could use restructuring in order to address the needs of low-income students living in the 21st century, the proposed solution is taking away the option of education altogether. The root problems that existed when President Johnson declared the “War on Poverty” are not only still here but are, in fact, worse. In 2008, the poverty rate was 13.2 percent higher than it was in 1973, according to the Brookings Institution. Education is and has always been the method to begin closing this gap.
The education instilled in a child at preschool age is crucial. Being able to distinguish colors and shapes and beginning to read at an early age will plant a seed for learning — one that will hopefully carry into that child’s higher levels of education.
It’s too late to give a child special attention in second grade or twelfth grade. Preschool is where it should start. For this reason, Head Start programs, though in need of restructuring, must be preserved and financially supported.
Jordyn Holman is a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism. Her column, “Making the Grade,” runs Wednesdays.
HEADStart is a successful program if you only measure it the right way. 
It employs architects. It pays for development of buildings. It pays for teachers that would otherwise be out of work. The Federal Government commissioned a study to measure the effectiveness for the children. The results are that after program the positives last only 2-3 years for the children.  What it does not do is make a long term measurable positive effect on the “students”. It is no different than child care or in home care. It is FRAUD for government to promise that HEADSTART will help children when it has proven over time that it does not.
 We have trillions of dollars in debt, we cannot afford programs that don’t show positive results for the target participants.
The concepts behind Operation Head Start and the War on Poverty are wonderful and idealistic. But virtually everything I read seems to indicate that Head Start is of negligible value and the War on Poverty destroyed the black family and the need for the dads to stay home, support their offspring and raise them.
Google these word combinations and see what you think. And yes, I agree with you; I also do not consider far right fringe groups’ opinions or findings to be objective or accurate, either.

Iggy Azalea is not your typical rapper, but I really mean it this time. No, she’s not a media studies student at an American liberal arts college. She’s a 23-year-old Australian blonde bombshell, and she’s making a serious push to become a legitimate voice in the hip-hop world. In fact, she’s arguably the most successful white female rapper of all time.
Azalea moved to the states at age 16. She drifted from Miami to Houston to Atlanta before finally settling in Los Angeles. Along the way, she tried to gain a foothold as a rapper, but struggled to be taken seriously.
Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons
Her luck began to change in 2011, after she released her first official music video, “Pu$$y,” on YouTube. After releasing her first mixtape, “Ignorant Art,” she began working with Atlanta-based rapper T.I. T.I.’s early presence in her career has certainly influenced her musical style, which strongly resembles Southern rap, or “Dirty South” style.
From there, her career exploded. In 2012, following the release of her EP, “Glory,” she became the first female non-American rapper to be featured on XXL Magazine’s Top 10 Freshman Class of rappers of the year. Her debut studio album, “The New Classic,” is slated for release on April 14. The album is expected to feature production from Diplo, Steve Aoki and Flosstradamus, and guest work from Cee-Lo Green, Katy Perry, T.I. and Rita Ora. It seems the music industry has welcomed Azalea with open arms.
But where does Azalea stand in the history of rap music? She simultaneously represents a new level of inclusiveness in the genre, as well as an increasing acceptance of cultural appropriation and superficiality, particularly in light of rap’s collision with pop.
Azalea has yet to say anything particularly interesting in any of her raps. She talks a lot about her sex appeal (she happens to be dating Lakers star and USC alumnus Nick Young), and frequently channels other Dirty South rappers’ obsessions with liquor and money. She also consciously strives to sound as stereotypically “ebonic” as possible. In her latest single, “Fancy,” she spits, “Still stuntin’ how you love that? /  Got the whole world askin’ how I does that.”

But it’s so hard to stay frustrated with Azalea. In interviews, she comes off as a humble, well-spoken girl next door, albeit with an Australian accent. She also seems to have a lot of respect for hip-hop as an art form. She talks about being inspired by the likes of Tupac and Lil’ Kim, and seems to take her own artistic development seriously. And her music is a lot of fun, even though it’s lyrically mind-numbing. But then again, most pop-rap is.
Perhaps it’s healthy for someone like Azalea to be so remarkably unselfconscious. She provides a stark contrast to Macklemore, who is painfully aware of his role in the music industry’s legacy of cultural appropriation. But her humility and deference ensure that she’ll never be like Riff Raff, another white rapper, whose apparent ignorance makes him impossible to take seriously.
Azalea is indicative of the complexity of contemporary culture. Is she a courageous boundary breaker or an appropriating sex symbol? If the popularity of “Fancy” is any indicator of her future success, more voices will surely weigh in on Iggy in the coming months.

I respect Iggy, she’s great. Sure her raps could be considered “fluffy” but she does rap about her experience and it really shows in her live performances. You can tell she puts her heart and soul into her music. Interested to see how she evolves and matures. Miley should take notes from Iggy, this is how you do controversial sexuality tastefully.
I really thought this article would be ragging on Iggy, but its quite profound insight. But she actually does have serious raps, you have to be a true fan to actually know all the work she’s put in.
