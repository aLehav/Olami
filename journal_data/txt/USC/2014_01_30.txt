Public relations professor Fritz Friedman coordinated Singleton’s appearance, noting it was a supreme opportunity for students.
“[These appearances] give [students] the opportunity to talk to the top-tier directors and actors,” he said. “It’s all about critical thinking … I’m opening a window for students to see what the real entertainment world is like. Not one in theory, not one of academia, but people that actually make it happen. It is about giving them information and creating their own ideas from it.”
Singleton, a USC alumnus, was enrolled in the school’s Filmic Writing program. The class was designed to instruct each student how to express his or her own vision.
“After high school I thought I knew everything about movies,” he said. “The film school helped me because I found out that I knew nothing about movies. And it humbled me. It broke me down to my last compound. That no matter what I did that I had to study film.”
After graduating from USC in 1990, he directed his first film Boyz n the Hood. At age 24, Singleton was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay at the 1991 Academy Awards.
“[Boyz n the Hood] is created as an independent film,” Singleton said. “I wrote this film at the basement of VKC. I didn’t have money for a computer, so I used one down there.”
He went on to reveal his marketing tactic for Boyz n the Hood.
“The trailer is great because for some people it scares you, but for some people they say, ‘Aw it’s going to be the sh-t,’ Singleton said. “You would never know that this movie would have any meaning to it. You would think that it would be just violence. I had to sell the audience one way to get the audience in.”
Professor and director of public relations studies Jerry Swerling said that Singleton is an appropriate model for the students.
“I think his insight on how you can succeed at a very young age and the nature of his creativity and how you can be true to yourself — I think that he is a good role model,” he said. “John’s background is unique in his own way and that is what I think students should be exposed to.”
The audience had an opportunity to for a Q&A session with Singleton. One of the students asked what his advice would be for an aspiring director.
“Learn how to write. Learn how to tell your own stories. You have to write your own thing and have it,” Singleton said. “It has to be a valuable enough for somebody to say that I’ll invest in this.”
He also mentioned that one of the mistakes that young filmmakers will do is move the camera for no apparent reason.
“My favorite filmmakers move the camera to the service of the story — Citizen Kane — phenomenal camera movement, but it is all in the service of the story,” Singleton said.
A fan since Singleton’s start of the career, Nathan Goodly, a graduate student studying in education, said since applying to graduate school, there have been two people he wanted to meet at his time at USC — John Singleton and Ronnie Lott.
“I am a huge fan of his. Boyz n the Hood came out when I was in middle school and I appreciate the way he depicted the true story of L.A. life and also [launched the acting career of] Ice Cube,” Goodly said.
Singleton shared how USC’s film school helped him to where he is today.
“It really led me to know that this is a great legacy to go into,” he said. “To be open to artistic expression and different forms of story telling. Also to find my own voice as a filmmaker.”

USC’s Undergraduate Student Government hosted an open meeting between campus administrators and new spring admits and transfer students on Thursday night.
Held in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the meeting aimed to give new students the opportunity to voice their concerns about housing, academics and more.
At the meeting was a panel of representatives from organizations with an interest in improving the undergraduate experiences of spring admits and transfer students.
Both Lynette Merriman, the assistant provost for support and advocacy, and Nahid Razavi, assistant dean of student development programs, were on the panel. Orientation coordinators Elizabeth Mitchell and Irvin Jerez were in attendance as well. Rini Sampath and Christine Hennes,     co-directors of USG External Affairs, moderated the meeting.
The first topic addressed was the lack of communication between the university and spring admit students during the fall semester before they’re enrolled. Several students in the audience mentioned the fact that they didn’t feel that they were given enough information before officially enrolling as a student.
Students suggested mentorship programs with past spring admits and greater communication with department advisors as potential solutions.
Housing was another major issue brought up during the discussion.
Students expressed concern over the difficulty of applying for student housing as spring admits. They told the panel that the timeline of applying for housing was too short, and asked for more information about all their options before being forced to commit to one housing option.
Spring admits rarely have the option to live on campus, and many of the students in attendance believed they were missing out on the freshman experience. They felt that being forced to live far from campus, often in apartments with upperclassmen, made it difficult for them to integrate themselves into the rest of the freshman class.
One solution proposed was a greater effort to place spring admits and transfers in one location to foster a sense of community.
The panel also addressed the differences between orientation in the fall and in the spring. Fall orientations have many more events than orientations in the spring and are more focused on building school spirit. Due to the schedule, spring orientations are shorter and focus more on the things the students need to know, such as housing, student organizations and campus safety. The students asked for a greater effort to make spring orientations more fun.
Katherine Stock, a freshman majoring in business administration, thought that knowing other students had the same concerns as she did helped alleviate some of the stress of being a spring admit.
“I appreciate them listening. I appreciate the conversation and just knowing that you’re not alone,” she said. “Just knowing that with classes and with orientation everyone had the same experiences.”
Brad Streicher, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and English, felt that the discussion was a good chance to let his voice be heard and came to the event to try to improve the assimilation of spring admit students.
“The spring admit process as a whole is a good opportunity for students and it’s just something that a lot of us felt could be improved,” he said. “We wanted to take the opportunity and try to voice our opinion to help other students in the future. It’s obvious that there’s some work to be done and so to know that the university is behind making changes, I think that’s something that’s really reassuring.”

The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation launched a campaign, “End Deathtraps Vote,” this week to stop USC from contracting with sweatshops that make college apparel.

The campaign is working toward acquiring student signatures for a petition requesting that USC only work with companies whose factories in Bangladesh adhere to a recently written safety accord, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.
The agreement calls for “safety inspections, remediation, and fire safety training” in company factories.
The accord was created by a coalition of international trade unions, Bangladesh trade unions and international brands and retailers. Currently more than 100 apparel corporations from 19 countries have signed the accord.
The independent agreement was written after several factory fires and collapses. One of the largest collapses, the Rana Plaza factory fire, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 factory workers.
SCALE has previously worked to promote the inspection of Bangladeshi factories affiliated with USC.
“[SCALE’s] campaign last year was for the Workers’ Rights Consortium, which is essentially a watchdog that enables monitors to come into these factories and actually check if these working conditions are what they are reported to be,” said SCALE member Aidan Blant, a sophomore majoring in computer engineering and computer science.
In March of last year, USC agreed to sign onto the Worker Rights Consortium.
Blant explained that SCALE hopes to keep advancing its campaign with this week’s vote.
“What we’re doing in this campaign is the next step,” he said. “Now that we can go into these factories and know these injustices are happening, we can push the university to take these steps to actually improve that.”
Universities that have endorsed this measure with their licensing brands include Duke University and New York University.
Students from SCALE hope to address their concerns directly with school administration.
Julia Wang, a SCALE member and senior majoring in neuroscience, spoke of the organization’s past involvement with administration.
“We’ve been delivering letters and addressing President Nikias throughout our entire campaign so far,” she said. “We’ve had a pretty positive relationship with him over our last campaign. We were able to talk to him about having USC sign onto this independent monitor. About two weeks after the meeting, he agreed to sign USC onto the Worker Rights Consortium.”
The organization hopes to continue working closely with Nikias’ administration.
“We’re hoping to sit down to talk to President Nikias about moving this university forward and ending USC-affiliated deathtraps, like the factories that don’t follow safety standards,” Wang said.
Sarah Newell, a SCALE member and junior majoring in business administration, explained that she learned about factory safety issues after coming to USC.
“I knew nothing [about factory safety issues] when I came to USC, but I really got educated about the sorts of conditions and the sorts of troubles that extended members of the Trojan Family face as they’re trying to make our apparel,” she said. “The Rana Plaza collapse -— the pictures and stories — is something that I couldn’t in good conscience walk away from, especially knowing that USC has the power to make such a real, tangible impact.”
SCALE hopes to encourage students to learn about the issue through a campus-wide vote. Members have promoted the vote both online as well as in person around campus.
“We want to show our administration that the USC student body supports this cause and that there is a broad base of people behind it,” Newell said. “We’re trying to demonstrate to USC that this is the right thing for them to do. We just don’t think USC should be doing business with brands that have blood on their hands. It’s not the sort of thing that we want to see associated with the Trojan name.”
Lorelei Christie, a SCALE member and freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, added that the week-long campaign was part of what has been a year-long effort.
“We’ve been running this campaign for the majority of the year, and this week is the vote,” she said. “It’s a power week, and the goal is to show USC that within a couple of days, we have a huge body of people who are interested.”
Students on campus seemed to have mixed reactions toward SCALE’s efforts.
Sarah French, a freshman majoring in biophysics, said she believes that USC should address the issue.
“Considering how much money USC has, it’s silly that we aren’t willing to pay a little more for apparel that isn’t made in terrible working conditions,” she said.
Linda Xu, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, worried that the shutdown could cause the loss of jobs.
“It’s important to know that your products come from a good area. You want to know that the place it’s being made is being regulated and safe,” she said. “But on the other hand, you think of the workers in Bangladesh who might be out of a job if demand at the factories decreased.”
The administration could not be reached for comment.
I’m all for getting these people a/c

I thought that part of studying abroad in an English-speaking country such as England meant that I would be spared the confusion and hassle of living in a place where communicating with the locals is difficult and generally awkward.
I was wrong.
It’s not that I can’t understand the people here; I can, most of the time, although those accents can sometimes be surprisingly dense to my U.S.-born ears. Yet in my mind, I instantly wrote off communication as one of the few things I would not have to worry about during my time living in London. I was so sure of this, in fact, that when cases contrary to my assumption arose, I was utterly unprepared.
I think this all set in after a few people in my program and I went to eat dinner at a popular burger joint in London called Byron – Proper Hamburgers. There was a 15-minute wait, so we stood outside in front of the restaurant until our table was called. After about two minutes, a group of people came up to us and asked if we were “queuing.”
My friends and I stared at each other blankly. We knew they were asking us if we were in line to get in, but how should we respond? Should we say “queue” back to them? Will they know what we mean if we said “line” instead of “queue?” Can the word “queue” really be used as a verb like that? It was an awkward pause like no other, which led us all to simply shake our heads and reminded us that we aren’t quite locals here in the U.K.
It sounds like an insignificant moment to recount, but since that miscommunication, I’ve become much more conscious of the disconnection between English in England and the U.S. English I know and love. Repeats of this small incident have begun to emerge daily, such as the time my professor said the word “pensioners” when he was talking about senior citizens. Or the sign at the train station that read, “Anti-social behavior will not be tolerated at King’s Cross station. You may be refused travel, removed from the train or arrested.” That seemed like an awfully harsh punishment for shyness, until I looked it up and discovered that here, the word “anti-social” refers to disorderly conduct punishable by law. The study abroad director at our university even told us during orientation that the subway here, known as the Tube, should be pronounced “chube,” but I don’t even hear a difference between the two words. After all that, I’m starting to get the feeling that I don’t know English as well as I thought I did.
I can only imagine that American students living in countries where English is not predominantly spoken are facing far more severe communication barriers than I am. Those people deserve some credit because I don’t think I personally could handle living in a new country and not being able to understand anyone around me.
Yet communication difficulties aren’t one-sided. Something all study abroad students share, in English-speaking countries or not, is the fact that as soon as we open our mouths, locals instantly know that we’re American. We all know that the United States has somewhat of a precarious reputation abroad, and thus, it’s hard not to feel like you’re constantly representing the United States to the rest of the world or being judged for your American-ness. I’ve already introduced myself and had people tell me that Chelsea is “not an American name” or ask me if I know Miley Cyrus. I’ve gotten some stern looks on the bus for talking loudly with my friends. So not only are we attempting to adjust to a new culture and form of language, but we are also battling stereotypes of our own culture at the same time.
If I’ve learned anything in my short time in London thus far, it’s that studying abroad is not really about blending in. There’s no way I could convince anyone here that I’m a born-and-bred Londoner, and I doubt that I’ll ever really start to feel like one. I probably won’t start saying “queue” or using the word “quite” a lot. I might have to ask the waiter at a restaurant what aubergine is (I was recently informed that it’s eggplant). There’s no shame in taking time to adjust to new things, despite the discomfort misunderstandings cause in the meantime. I’ve decided it’s time to embrace the awkwardness abroad.
After all, it seems like it’s not going anywhere.

“I really miss Chinese food now, especially at this time of the year,” said Nancy Lin, a freshman majoring in accounting. “With Chinese New Year right around the corner, I could use some spicy xiangchang right now.”
It’s a sentiment that seems to be echoed by many Asian international students and Asian-American students, leaving them nostalgic for their native food and traditions as the holiday arrives today.
“There are a lot of misconceptions about Chinese New Year in Los Angeles,” said Ryan Chen, a freshman majoring in computer engineering. “For example, lots of non-Chinese think that Gong Hay Fat Choy is how Chinese people say, “Happy New Year,” but in reality, that’s just how Cantonese speakers pronounce it. Most Chinese people, who speak Mandarin, pronounce it more like Gong Xi Fa Cai.”
With the undergraduate and graduate Asian community at USC now at more than 9,000 members, the diversity within the population, particularly the East Asian cultures, is particularly overlooked.
While the holiday is called Chinese New Year, in reality, almost all of East Asia celebrates the holiday. The name in English comes from the fact that Chinese immigrants were the first large immigrant group to come from Asia to the United States, so the holiday has become attached to China in Americans’ minds.
Korea also celebrates the Lunar New Year, however, called seollal in Korean.
“In Korea, I would go home to see family, usually visiting my mom’s side for lunch and my father’s side for dinner,” said William Han, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering. “I would spend a lot of time playing traditional Korean games with my cousins while the adults sat around talking and drinking soju. Seollal is really a time to spend with family. However, since I’ve moved to the states, all my relatives are in Korea, and it isn’t really possible for my family to go back, so usually we just sit at home at play a few games amongst ourselves.”
Many other Korean and Korean-American students also expressed their disappointment that they would not be able to go back home to spend time with their family.
“For me, seollal is about eating dduk gook with family,” said Eliot Kim, a Korean-American freshman majoring in economics. Dduk gook is rice cake soup that is traditionally eaten on New Year’s Day. It is a thick broth composed of rice cake, egg, marinated meat and seaweed.
“I also remember going to do jesa and going to the cemetery as well,” Kim said. Traditionally, Koreans go to the cemetery during Lunar New Year to pay respect to the deceased, and the term jesa refers to this tradition.
Many of the Chinese students at USC also miss the cuisine native to the holiday. Northern Chinese people traditionally eat jiaozi, a type of dumpling on the day before New Year’s, whereas southern Chinese people eat fish and chunjian, a DIY-style roll with meat and fresh vegetables, as a sort of Asian fajita. Different areas of China always eat different foods that are special to that region.
“I always eat spicy meat and spicy sausage on New Year’s, as well as many different cuts of pig meat,” Lin said. Lin hails from the Sichuan province, an area of China well-known for its heavily spice-infused dishes.
Many Chinese students also miss the firecrackers and other forms of celebration. The act of setting off firecrackers is referred to as fangbianpao in Mandarin.
“I miss setting off long strings of firecrackers back home,” said Cheney Zhong, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering. “Back home in Beijing, on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, there are always firecrackers being set off in the streets. Sometimes it’s so loud that it’s pretty much impossible to sleep.”
In Chinese culture, it is also customary to stay up all night on New Year’s Eve until dawn, so that one sees the New Year arise.
“I remember staying up through the night with my family, talking and messing around with my cousins and eating jiaozi all the time,” said Patrick Zhu, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering.
More recently, it has become commonplace for Chinese people in America to call back home to pay their respects to their parents and relatives, and wish them a happy and prosperous new year.
“I need to call my parents soon to wish them a happy new year,” Zhu said. “Everybody’s on break right now, because we don’t get a Christmas break in China. Our winter break is around New Year’s, so my parents, relatives and friends are all pretty free right now.”
At the end of New Year’s celebration in Chinese culture is yuanxiaojie, or the Lantern Festival. It occurs on the 15th day of the lunar New Year and is a time when children go out with lanterns and play in the streets, while the adults walk around and take in the sights. It is traditional to eat tangyuan on this day, a glutinous rice ball with different fillings on the inside, such as black sesame paste, peanut paste, red bean paste or sugar.
“I could really use some tangyuan right now,” Zhong said. “That’s my favorite New Year’s snack.”
Many of USC’s Asian-American organizations are holding events for the Asian population at USC. For example, the Taiwanese American Organization is providing rides for a group outing to a local Taiwanese hotspot restaurant on Friday at 5:30 p.m.

It’s never been easier to bite into that roasted artichoke and spinach thin-crust pizza you’ve always wanted to try, or munch on some boneless buffalo bites — with the arrival of the Manhattan Beach Chamber of Commerce Dine MB Restaurant Week, which begins this Sunday and runs through next Friday. With 15 participating restaurants, ranging from corporate family chains such as California Pizza Kitchen to sports bars unique to the seaside town such as Sharks Cove, Restaurant Week will allow each venue to offer a pre-fixed menu to display its respective culinary style and vision.
Design by Danny Razzano
The first annual Dine MB event comes as a complement to the larger-scale, more widely known dineLA Restaurant Week, which took place Jan. 20-31 and included more than 250 restaurants. It also trails California Restaurant Month, which occurred in January and heralds an even larger following, with 30 destinations across the state, from the Central Valley to the snowy Sierra Mountains.
Brittany Keohi, director of communications and events for the Manhanttan Beach Chamber of Commerce, said that the eateries were chosen after they reached out to local businesses and asked if they wanted to get involved, in an effort to promote an area that has been slowly earning its stripes as one of the city’s rising food hubs.
“The main purpose is to get people down to Manhattan Beach and give them the opportunity to see what we have going on here,” Keohi said. “A bunch of local restaurants have been written up in food blogs such as Thrillist and LA Weekly, and they’ve gotten a lot of awards. Manhattan Beach is more up-and-coming in the foodie world … so we’re trying to capitalize on that.”
One participating restaurant, FISHBAR, a casual fish and seafood place serving dishes such as seared ahi tuna tacos and lobster macaroni and cheese, has earned accolades for the South Bay’s freshest seafood. Executive Chef Jessica Jordan said she reflects this view on the recent development of the shoreline spot, once only recognized for its surfing.
“The whole dining scene is evolving,” Jordan said. “I really think that it’s becoming a culture of the city.”
Though each menu varies in content depending on what the chef has designed, they all include an appetizer, entrée and dessert, and combine traditional, old-time favorites with newer, more exotic plates created just for the week.
Each menu will fit into one of the $25, $35 and $45 pricing categories in hopes of accommodating any diner’s budget.
“It’s a range,” Keohi said. “The Strand House is the $45 [restaurant], and that’s very high-end, right on the strand here in Manhattan Beach — very nice place. But then we have other ones, such as OB’s, which is kind of a bar and grill.”
While Keohi said the event seeks to attract new customers to the city, Jordan said that for her, it’s more about providing something special for the customers that already patronize these businesses.
“It would be great if we got new customers to come into our bubble, but I think it’s really something that’s great for the residents … on a smaller scale, and keeping it more local,” Jordan said.
As a burgeoning hodgepodge of food and fine dining, each restaurant is said to offer something different from the next. When it comes to FISHBAR, Jordan said it’s the restaurant’s plain, bang-for-your-buck mentality that keeps the crowds coming back.
“FISHBAR really delivers a value — it’s a consistent quality at a great price,” Jordan said. “You can go more than once a week and not feel bad about eating there.”
Keohi said the Chamber of Commerce is promoting the event through a number of different outlets.
“We have placed ads in the local newspaper, and we have also teamed up with South Bay Magazine … We have an ad right now on their site,” Keohi said. “And that’s not to mention the stuff we do internally, through our database. We also hand out fliers at all of our events.”
They are also partnering with Uber, the ridesharing mobile application, by offering $20 off a ride to any Dine MB reservation for first-time Uber users.
Ultimately, what Keohi thinks will draw visitors is the change of pace that Manhattan Beach offers — an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.
“It’s a lot more laidback of a place,” Keohi said. “We’re kind of go-with-the-flow, but it’s also very elegant. It’s definitely a different vibe than you would have going to an L.A. restaurant.”

Two summers ago, 17-year-old Missy Franklin introduced herself to the world as the United States’ biggest swimming phenom since Michael Phelps. After winning five medals (four gold) and setting two world records at the 2012 London Olympics, she sat down for a delightfully bubbly interview with NBC’s Bob Costas, which, according to my lengthy internet research, has unfortunately been removed from the Internet since.
But I still remember watching her mention to Costas that her top three college choices were USC, Cal and Georgia (in no particular order).
I immediately perked up — as I’m sure USC swimming and diving coach Dave Salo (who is also a U.S. Olympic women’s swim team assistant coach) did, too. With all the athletic excellence showcased at USC, it can be hard for the swimming and diving teams to capture the attention of the Trojan faithful — even though the men’s and women’s teams have claimed a combined 10 NCAA championships.
But if Franklin did end up attending USC, each home meet had the potential to draw fans from all over Los Angeles — and more importantly, build upon the women’s singular NCAA title won in 1997.
Alas, that wouldn’t come to fruition. A few months after the Olympics, during her senior year in high school, Franklin chose Cal — which made sense, despite the fact she was born down the road in Pasadena. The Golden Bears had won the 2011 and 2012 NCAA Women’s championships while the Women of Troy had placed third in both. The decision would also allow Franklin to follow in the footsteps of her favorite athlete and fellow backstroke master Natalie Coughlin, a Cal alumna.
This season, Franklin’s first collegiate campaign, things have played out about as expected. Though USC was ranked No. 1 to begin the season, Cal has surged behind Franklin to claim the top spot in the polls with an undefeated record. Meanwhile, the Women of Troy have fallen to No. 5 — but there’s plenty of reason to believe USC could hand the Bears their first loss of the 2013-14 season and prove that they don’t need Franklin to compete for their first women’s national title in 17 years.
First off, the Women of Troy are undefeated in dual-meets this season, too. They also handily won the SMU Classic over No. 7 North Carolina and No. 14 Louisville, among other schools. Their average margin of victory hasn’t been as impressive as Cal’s — hence the drop in the polls — but in dual meets, a victory is a victory.
And to counter Franklin, USC has eight reigning All-American swimmers. Though Franklin holds the nation’s top times this season in the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle, USC senior Kasey Carlson set the fastest time in the 100-yard free (ahead of Franklin), the second-fastest in the 100-yard breast and the third-fastest in the 50-yard free. All of USC’s freestyle relays are in the top four in the country, and the 200-yard and 400-yard free relays have set school records.
The Women of Troy could actually own a sizable home-pool advantage on Friday to help their cause, too. It’s the first home meet of the season at the new Uytengsu Aquatics Center since classes have been in session, and Franklin’s presence is sure to bring some extra spectators. And while every American probably wants to see the sport’s poster child succeed, it’d be extra sweet for USC fans if their squad could pull off an upset over their NorCal rivals.
Last year, No. 1 USC stormed into the Golden Bears’ home pool and left with a thrilling 155-145 victory. But the Women of Troy would end up finishing just seventh in the NCAA Championships with 291 points, well behind second-place Cal (393) and champion Georgia (477).
If the Women of Troy want to let this year’s contenders know that they can improve on that mark, they’ll have to make a statement by beating the Bears — or at least hanging close — on Friday.
And if USC does pull off the feat, Franklin and the Bears could enter the Pac-12 Tournament next month as slight underdogs – a position that the Women of Troy have gotten used to over the past few years. After their meets this weekend (against Cal on Friday at 3 p.m. and No. 4 Stanford on Saturday at noon), we’ll know if they’re ready to surpass Franklin and Cal onto the highest step of the podium.

At the midpoint of conference play, the USC women’s basketball team finds itself in second place in the Pac-12.
Drive for success · Senior forward Cassie Harberts and the Women of Troy sit in second place in the Pac-12 as they head into the second half . – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
The team has already eclipsed last year’s 11-win total with nine regular-season games still to play.
The Women of Troy (14-7, 7-2 Pac-12) were trounced by the No. 4 Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. earlier in the week, but the team is looking to get back on a winning streak this weekend when Washington State and Washington come to the Galen Center.
Washington State (11-9, 5-3) will get the first shot at beating the Women of Troy at home on Friday night, which has been a difficult feat for USC’s other opponents this season. USC has yet to lose a conference game at home and has not lost a game at the Galen Center since Dec. 19, when the Saint Mary’s Gaels took down the Women of Troy by a score of 71-55.
Washington (10-9, 3-5), on the other hand, will try to catch the Women of Troy sleeping as the two teams play in a pre-Super Bowl matinee Sunday at 11 a.m.
The Cougars fell to both Oregon and Oregon State on the road by double digits last week.
Guards Lia Galdeira and Tia Presley lead WSU in scoring with 18.6 and 18.4 points per game, respectively, and if the Women of Troy want to pull off a victory, they are going to have to stop WSU’s dynamic backcourt.
The Huskies, who followed their state rival by losing to the Oregon schools in a similar fashion, also feature two great scorers in their backcourt in Jazmine Davis and Kelsey Plum. Davis averages 20 points per game, while Plum adds 19.6.
There were many positive takeaways for USC from their Bay area road trip, arguably their toughest road trip of the year, as the team upset No. 16 Cal, 77-70, behind a career-high 34 points by junior guard Ariya Crook.
Senior forward Cassie Harberts also hit another career milestone on the trip against Stanford, becoming the No. 8 all-time leading scorer in Women of Troy history.
“I like the way things have been going,” Harberts said. “We need to continue it going forward.”
First-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke felt that they could use the tough game against the Cardinal as a learning experience for a team that is in a great position to make the NCAA tournament for the first time in eight years.
“We are going to use this as a measuring stick to become the elite team we want to be moving forward,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Now we know what we need to do and how we need to practice in order to become elite.”
Cooper-Dyke, however, stressed how the Women of Troy will take it game by game. This weekend’s pair of contests against two middle-of-the-road Washington teams should test the team’s maturity and serve as a learning experience.
“You learn from your mistakes,” Cooper-Dyke said. “Basketball is about growing. If you are staying the same, then someone is passing you by. We will learn from this and move on. We can’t hold on to it.”
After taking on Washington State and Washington, the Women of Troy will begin preparing to face UCLA on Feb. 8.

The Pac-12 and the SEC are considered two of the most powerful football conferences in the nation. And though it might not be a well-known fact, these two conferences dominate collegiate  tennis as well.
True talent · Senior Ray Sarmiento is ranked No. 10 in the nation and plays at the top singles slot for the Trojans. He and his partner, junior Yannick Hanfmann, are unranked in doubles but have been dominant so far this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
That was USC men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith’s reasoning behind the creation of this weekend’s Pac-12/SEC Showdown, in which the Trojans will host conference rivals UCLA as well as SEC powerhouses Georgia and Florida.
The tournament, which Smith called his and UCLA head coach Billy Martin’s “brainchild,” will feature fierce competition, as UCLA, Georgia and USC are all ranked in the top five teams in the nation, at No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4, respectively. Florida is the lowest-ranked team heading into the weekend, sitting just outside the top 10 at No. 11.
“To have three of the four teams be top five is special,” Smith said.
In addition to their high rankings, all four teams hosted and won their Intercollegiate Tennis Association Kick-Off Weekend tournaments, earning berths to next month’s ITA National Team Indoor Championships.
USC easily offed Santa Clara and Wichita State en route to its ITA Kick-Off Weekend title.
“We were so dominant,” Smith said. “Everything looked good, so I think we do need a little tougher test and that’s certainly going to happen this weekend.”
The Trojans didn’t drop a set throughout the tournament, and delivered some powerful individual performances, including senior captain Ray Sarmiento’s 6-0, 6-0 beatdown of his opponent from Wichita State in the championship match.
Sarmiento acknowledged that the level of competition in the Pac-12/SEC Showdown will be much higher than it was last weekend, as he will likely be matched up against the highest-ranked players from Georgia and Florida at the top singles slot. Sarmiento is ranked No. 10 in the nation in singles, while Georgia’s Austin Smith leads his team at No. 12 in the nation and  Florida’s Stephane Piro is ranked No. 28.
“Georgia and Florida are both talented teams, so we’ve got to come out ready and prepared,” Sarmiento said. “The best I can do is take care of the things I can control, and I believe that gives me the best chance of winning.”
Despite the steep increase in the level of competition and the fact that these tough matchups are coming early in the season, the Trojans aren’t worried about playing such highly ranked opponents.
“We just have to stay focused and play one point at a time and not get distracted by winning or losing,” junior Jonny Wang said. “We’re not really worrying too much about results this early. We want to be our best in May.”
Though in the past the Trojans have been unbeatable — putting together a 45-match winning streak from 2011-2012 — losing is a real possibility this weekend. USC will not play UCLA, which may come as a relief considering the Bruins beat the Trojans three times out of four last season, but the Trojans will have their work cut out for them with the Bulldogs and the Gators.
USC, Georgia and Florida each have five players ranked in the top 125 in singles, but Georgia also boasts the 12th-ranked doubles team in the nation, while one of Florida’s pairs ranks 13th. Meanwhile, none of USC’s doubles teams are ranked in the top 60.
In his past 11 years of coaching at USC, Smith has established himself as a fearless leader, and he lives up to his reputation heading into this weekend’s tough draw.
“I think this team needs this, I really do. Win, lose or draw, we need it,” Smith said. “We need to kind of find out how good we are and see how good everyone else is and we need to be pushed … I’m not afraid to lose and not afraid of challenges so I’m really looking forward to it.”
UCLA will take on Florida on  Saturday at 10 a.m. at Marks Stadium. USC will play Georgia next, at 1 p.m. On Sunday, UCLA will face Georgia at 10 a.m. before USC battles Florida at 1 p.m.

The National September 11 Memorial & Museum revealed last week that the museum would be asking for a $24 admission fee, according to CNN. But those who have resorted to blaming the museum for the high cost are holding the wrong people accountable.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The ticket price was set and approved by the memorial’s board of trustees to keep the museum running as a part of its $63 million operating budget and financial plan, according to the Wall Street Journal. That had not stopped the memorial, however, from attempting to secure federal funding. In 2011, the memorial pushed a bill asking Congress to allocate $20 million in annual federal funding to the museum. It also put forth efforts to secure funding from the city of New York. Both attempts were unsuccessful.
Critics of the price accuse the museum of making a tourist attraction out of an important national site. But the price tag isn’t about profiting over the nation’s loss. Rather, it’s about maintaining a space for people to learn about and commemorate the nation’s history without the luxury of relying on federal support.
Approximately 5.3 million people visited the neighboring 9/11 memorial in 2013, and it is projected that the museum will see an annual attendance of 2.5 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. If the museum were to attract that many paying visitors per year, it would amount to roughly $60 million — just shy of its $63 million operating budget. The museum simply cannot afford to reduce its prices.
The federal government won’t pay for it, and the museum certainly cannot pay for itself. Yet despite the lack of funding, the museum has gone out of its way to ensure that every American — regardless of socioeconomic background — has the right to visit this historic site. Relatives of September 11 victims as well as children under the age of 5 will always be granted free admission to the museum. In addition, the museum will be open to the public at no charge for three hours every Tuesday evening, thus providing a weekly opportunity for those who might not otherwise be able to afford it.
The museum isn’t the only one charging hefty prices. Comparatively, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which also doesn’t receive government funding, charges $25 per ticket. And the city’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum charges $22. Other museums that are able to offer reduced ticket prices or free admission, such as the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., benefit from sizable government support — $48 million and $26 million, respectively. The two scenarios simply aren’t equitable.
September 11 was a tragedy that shook the nation, and its museum should be one that is accessible to all Americans, regardless of wealth. But rather than blame the museum for attempting to make ends meet, Americans should demand that such an important place of learning and remembrance — like other federally funded institutions — receive the same support.

September 11, a day of loss and remembrance for Americans everywhere, should never be associated with a price tag. Yet the National September 11 Memorial & Museum has managed to do just that.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
Last Friday, to the ire of many critics, the organization set a $24 mandatory admission fee on the 9/11 Museum, according to CNN. The big question is not just why such an exorbitant price is necessary, but also why there is a price at all? The opportunity to commemorate the day and the many lives lost should come free to all. Yet the fee appears to be more geared toward profit than the greater purpose of educating future generations of the tragic moment in U.S. history.
Joe Daniels, president of the organization, said in a press conference last Friday that the ticket price had been based on the 2014 annual operating budget of $63 million for the completed memorial and museum. Though it is true that the organization does not get any federal funding, does it really need $24 per person to cover the $63 million for “daily costs, including salaries”?
The adjoining outdoor 9/11 memorial has attracted 11.5 million visitors since its opening on Sept. 12, 2011, according to CNN. If the museum attracts just as many, it will rack up $276 million in two years, or $138 million annually — an amount that nearly doubles its $63 million budget.
Besides the fact that the price tag puts the museum in league with the most expensive in the country, there’s the bigger issue of preventing many from visiting and learning about the tragedy. Not every family of four can afford $96 for a day at the museum.
And then there’s the even bigger issue beyond the high price itself: its very existence. Though supporters of the fee are quick to point out that the memorial is free of charge, it still doesn’t make it right to charge admission to a museum that has the purpose of not only educating visitors, but also a memorial that commemorates the lives lost. In that regard, it’s the same as requiring people to pay more than just their respects to a memorial.
Sally Regenhard and retired Deputy Fire Chief Jim Riches, both of whom lost sons who were firefighters on Sept. 11, told the Los Angeles Times that the museum “was created to tell the story of 9/11 to future generations about the worst day in American history … It was never intended to be a revenue–generating tourist attraction with a prohibitive budget and entrance fee.”
There are many possible alternatives to the mandatory fee, including a suggested donation. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has a suggested admission of $25, but not a required one. If a required fee really is necessary for the September 11 museum, it could definitely be lowered from $24 to make the price at least more affordable.
The museum aims to serve as an opportunity to remember an emotionally unifying, collectively felt experience of our time, and it’s wrong to put a price tag on it.

Only a USC student would even think it is a valid question to ask why anything comes with a price tag. So does the author feel the people who work at the museum should do so for free? Should the electricity and water that goes to this facility be done so for free? Should the janitorial staff that keeps the  place clean everyday work for free? 
Does this writer actually think money just comes and magically pays for things while we sleep and that only evil, middle-aged ESTABLISHMENT-Types who are evil make it not so? The reason there is a price tag is the same reason once this writer graduates and gets out in the real world – she will need to find a way to buy food and pay the rent. 
I guess when mommy and daddy pay for things – USC students think the world does not need money to actually run.
Maybe we could ask Saudi Arabia to help pay for it.
That’ll be the day.
