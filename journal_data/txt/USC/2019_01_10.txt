Rihanna is just one artist expected to release music in 2019. (Photo courtesy of Roc Nation)
From Childish Gambino, Tame Impala and Ariana Grande (all of whom are Coachella headliners this year) to celebrity icons Madonna, Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, many ears will be blessed in 2019. 
Pop music is coming back big time. One of the most anticipated pop releases of 2019 is Ariana Grande’s fifth studio album, “thank u, next.” Her pop omnipresence is likely to endure past last year’s triumphs in “God is a woman” and “thank u, next.” With teases like the titular song and “imagine,” “thank u, next” is looking to be the most authentically Ariana album yet.
Grande isn’t the only international pop star expected to release new music this year, however, with singers like Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga and Cardi B more rumored to be working on music. As avid Swift fans have discovered, we might see the singer shed her snake skin with new music as soon as April. 
In the post-“A Star Is Born” era, Lady Gaga is expected to release new music that will return to the more experimental and beat-heavy anthems of her earlier albums. And, because one album simply isn’t enough for Gaga, she is expected to release a “Cheek to Cheek” follow-up with Tony Bennett. 
Sia is another artist taking on a double album year. The “Chandelier” singer has tweeted about “releasing an album and a feature length musical [she] wrote and directed.” Aside from a new solo album, Sia also has plans to release an album with Diplo and Labrinth as part of their group, LSD.
Rihanna’s long awaited return to music could become a reality in 2019. Going back to her Caribbean roots, Rihanna is expected to incorporate dancehall sounds in her new album. According to Rolling Stone, “Jamaican producers and songwriters have submitted 500 records for a new album that’s been more than a year in the making,” with aims to get the final tracklist down to ten records. 
Also following the Sia and Gaga two-album path, Rihanna has hinted at both a dancehall album and a separate pop-oriented album.
As if all these popular names weren’t enough. Madonna has been working with Mike Dean and Mirwais, who helped produce “Music,” and is now in the final mixing stages of the album. And Bruce Springsteen told the U.K.’s Sunday Times he has a new “singer-songwriter album — more of a solo record,” on the way.
It’s hard to believe that, even after all these names, there are plenty of other major musicians outside of the pop genre set to release new music this year. But, it’s true. From breakthroughs acts Billie Eilish and Lizzo to established musicians Jennifer Lopez and Janet Jackson, 2019 will not disappoint for music fans of any genre.

USC Village’s new Italian locale, Il Giardino, features a build-your-own pasta menu, complementing every dish with bread and an extensive selection of special sauces. (Photo courtesy of Il Giardino)
Like the mythological Hydra,   USC Village regenerates its losses at an alarming speed, recently replacing the short-lived Italian spot Cafe Barilla with another: Il Giardino. Unlike the Greek myth, in which each new Hydra head is more aggressive than the last, Il Giardino is pleasant and affordable, ironing out the kinks of its predecessor with a more refined menu, better quality pasta and more generous portions. 
Like other USC Village spaces, Il Giardino has a minimal and trendy interior, with plant decals and an open kitchen that’s more or less unchanged from Cafe Barilla’s setup. Music thumps at a pleasant volume inside, loud enough to alleviate any tension and quiet enough to be ignored while working. There’s a variety of seating options, including a long, communal table in the middle of the dining section as well as outdoor tables. A cook buzzes from station to station behind the glass partition separating the front from the back, building each pasta order one by one.
The majority of the menu is devoted to pasta, with both a build-your-own pasta option and preset pasta specials. Of the two, the build-your-own pasta is significantly emphasized, with about six different types of pasta and seven variations of sauces to try. The rest of the menu is occupied by sandwiches, two salads and two entrees. Each menu item is below or around $15, with the sandwiches and pasta specials at $10.95 and the build-your-own pasta at $9.95. 
Il Giardino uses the same type of fast-casual concept as most other USC Village restaurants. But the budding restaurant has yet to settle, serving food in to-go bowls with plastic forks and relying on a numbered receipt to connect you with your order. 
Nonetheless, the service was alert and attentive, lingering by my table to make sure I enjoyed my pasta and to offer a lid and bag as my order gradually grew bigger.
Some standouts from the 42 possible pasta/sauce combinations are the gnocchi, pesto and mushroom cream sauce. The pesto is bright and creamy, not too oily but full of flavor, garnished with a small pile of pine nuts on top. The gnocchi tastes fresh, pillowy but not overdone, and sturdy enough to compliment the sauces. Each pasta bowl is served with a slice of focaccia-esque bread, bright yellow and soft enough to sop up an impressive amount of sauce.
Il Giardino serves two bolognese sauces: one vegan with mushroom, and one traditional with beef. Most surprising is the porcini mushroom sauce, as the sweetness from the cream and savoriness from the mushroom combine to form a sauce that manages to enhance the pasta with only a light coating. 
While they offer chicken on top of cream-based sauces, there are no other possible toppings for the pastas besides garnish, limiting the options for customization to only pasta and sauce. 
The sandwiches are served on the same bread, warmed slightly and cut diagonally. The caprese sandwich was satisfying for its price, with a tangy pesto dressing complimenting the sliced tomato and mozzarella, but paled in comparison to the pasta.  
Il Giardino offers other items on its menu, but the pasta is the most accomplished option, served in large and filling portions for a reasonable price — a bit of a unicorn at USC Village. 
While the restaurant’s interior may be thoroughly modern, its menu channels traditional and authentic Italian food. The sauces exude time and care, a product of well-crafted recipes and well-instructed execution. 
Following its first loss at the village, Cafe Barilla, USC has conjured up a stronger and more resilient pasta place to take its stead. And while Il Giardino may seem like an uncanny replacement for Cafe Barilla, a bite of its pasta will prove otherwise.

The USC hockey team during its 6-5 victory over UCLA in Game 2 of the Crosstown Cup. (Photo courtesy of USC Hockey Twitter page)
The buzzer sounds, and the players raise their arms in celebration, streaming off the bench. The final score reads: USC 6, UCLA 5. “We Are the Champions” blares as players pass around the Crosstown Cup and exchange hugs.
Outside, a fan in USC colors tells assistant coach Jerry Toy, “As long as you’re still standing, UCLA will never get that cup again.” Sharon Vazquez, the mother of team captain Aidan Vazquez, excitedly shows off a text she received from Aidan’s brother — watching the live stream on YouTube from Arizona — after Aidan scored a goal. 
This isn’t a football game or even a basketball game. It’s a men’s hockey game late on a Friday night in the middle of November, all the way at the Anaheim Ducks’ practice facility in Orange County. 
Most USC students wouldn’t know the first thing about the ice hockey club team at USC. But if students were to make the hour-and-a-half drive through rush hour traffic to experience a game, they would find a dedicated group of nearly 40 players and a volunteer group of coaches and staff. They would find the stands full of mostly parents and close friends of the players. And they would see a team that is one of USC’s oldest —  it first started in 1924.
A historic club
An article from 1925 published in USC’s yearbook, El Rodeo, describes the origins of the team. It sprouted as the first ice skating rink in Los Angeles, the Palais de Glace, was built. 
“By unceasing effort and enthusiasm of purpose on the part of the vitally interested and the students of the University,” the story stated, “the school authorities were shown that hockey was deserving of support as a University sport.”
The story notes a large turnout from the start for practices and is optimistic about the future of the sport. In the following year’s issue of the yearbook, the team was described as one that “brought honor to the school” and, by 1927, the program was “forging rapidly to the front as one of the most popular” —  it lost just one game all season. 
A Sports Illustrated article published in 1987 recounts a fierce rivalry in the 1930s between USC and Loyola Marymount University, with fans packing the 5,000-seat Polar Palace — which burned down in a fire in 1963 — at the corner of Melrose and Van Ness avenues near Hollywood. The games even drew celebrities, including actor Bing Crosby. According to the Daily Trojan archives, the team received regular beat coverage in the ‘30s and game updates appeared often in the student paper until the mid-2000s. 
“This is one of the older, more robust club sports teams,” said Jeff Dralla, the team’s general manager. 
Dralla graduated from USC in 2006 and spent five years playing for the team before serving as head coach and currently as general manager. According to Dralla, the program has survived this long because it hasn’t undergone much change. Over the last 25 years, there have only been four different head coaches. 
“More important than skill on the team, more important than quality of coach is the overall stability in program,” Dralla said. “One false move, one really bad financial year, one misstep in budget or an issue with USC from a policy perspective and the program is out the door.”
Funding and distance
Unlike in the 1930s, the club hockey team is no longer a well-known commodity around campus. It undergoes the typical struggles that any club team goes through with funding, travel and recruitment. Dralla, who also serves as the associate director for the Pac-8 conference, which USC is part of, said the administration doesn’t give the hockey team the sort of special privilege when it comes to recruiting that the football or basketball teams may receive in terms of academics.
Though the team receives the maximum funding of $8,000 from the Recreational Club Council, that amount is barely enough to finance one road trip, according to Andrew Philps, the team president. 
“We are the largest budget far and away for any club sport,” said Philps, a junior majoring in real estate development. 
Dralla said the budget runs in excess of $100,000. Hockey is an expensive sport, requiring gear, jerseys and ice. The majority of the team’s funding comes from donations and member dues, which are close to $4,000 a year. 
Around half the program’s budget is spent on ice time alone. Because there is no rink near campus, the team plays its games at the Ducks’ practice facility in Anaheim and practices in Lakewood —  20 miles away from USC — once a week on Mondays from 10 p.m. to midnight. The late start time is due to both the availability of the players, who are in class all day and the lower cost. 
“We try to cram everything in,” head coach Tyler Maxwell said. “It’s all about them getting the rust off, getting touches in.” 
The distance between the team’s home rink and campus — the team travels further to play their home games than road games against Loyola Marymount, UCLA and Cal State Northridge — keeps away many would-be USC hockey fans. According to Anthony Ciardelli, who covered the team when he was a graduate student at USC and now broadcasts their games, the team will eventually need to have its own rink if it wants to take the next step of becoming a Division I program. He said that would cost around $100 million.
“You need to make it closer so students can go, but how much space is there on the USC campus to do it?” Ciardelli said. “That’s a major barrier and a major issue. 
What isn’t an issue is the commitment of those involved in the program. Everyone on staff, from the coaches to the medical staff, volunteers their time.  
“No,” said Toy, chuckling when asked if he is paid as an assistant coach. “We put a lot of time in, but we don’t get paid.” 
Toy, who also coaches the women’s ice hockey club team at USC, does not miss a single team event. 
“Every practice, every game, every function,” he said.
Student run
The program, like all club sports, is student run. There is a president, vice president, treasurer and social media director. Sharon Vazquez, who helps with game operations, said there are only certain things she can help with. 
“I wish I could do more, but it’s student run,” Vazquez said. “We need to hold them accountable. They need to run this. That’s really important. That’s going to pay off in the long run. They’re learning a lot of things, life skills.”
Running a program with a $100,000 budget means the players have to balance their time properly. According to Dralla, players’ grades are usually higher over the course of the season than they are in March or April, when the season is less organized.
“We’re forced to be more structured,” said Keegan Jones, a sophomore majoring in business administration, who acts as the social media director for the team.
All of the work put in lends itself to a team that is close, both on and off the ice, providing an outlet for those who came to USC from hockey-crazed parts of the country to keep playing the game they love. 
“To be able to go to school in a place like Southern California, but also play on a team where it’s not so demanding like a Division I sport, we still have that teammate feel and the vibe,” Jones said. 
Travis Schwartz, who is from Dix Hills, N.Y., is in his fifth year on the team and could not imagine coming to Los Angeles and not playing hockey. 
“Freshman year, it gave me my friend group,” said Schwartz, a senior majoring in business administration. “I didn’t have to go through any process to find my friend group. I just automatically had my close friends.”
Those bonds were apparent that Friday night in Anaheim, when the team emerged victorious from a chippy, intense game against their crosstown rivals. They stayed on the ice for 20 minutes after the game ended, passing around the trophy, taking group pictures and celebrating with friends and family who had made the long commute from Los Angeles. 
And those bonds are apparent in people like Maxwell, who coaches this team out of passion and love rather than money. He wants to see it grow, and still be at USC the day it rises to a Division I program.
“I’m in it for the long haul, not the quick buck,” Maxwell said.

The Trojans will face their first matchups of the season this weekend in Honolulu for the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Warrior Classic. The tournament marks the beginning of men’s volleyball’s 50th season at USC.
The weekend starts with a match against Concordia (0-3, 0-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) on Thursday at 4 p.m. HST. The Trojans have dominated this series, with a 5-2 record against the Eagles. After this weekend, the Trojans will meet Concordia again in conference play.  
On Friday, the Trojans (0-0, 0-0 MPSF) face the New Jersey Institute of Technology (0-2) at 4 p.m. HST. The Trojans have not played NJIT since beating them in 2009.
They will finish on Saturday by taking on No. 4 Hawaii (0-0) at 7:30 p.m. HST. The Trojans will be looking to narrow the gap in the 44-39 series and will specifically want to avenge a 3-0 sweep at the hands of the Rainbow Warriors in last season’s Texaco Rainbow Warrior Classic.
“Hawaii’s returning a lot of the guys that they had last year and they definitely finished as one of the top teams this past year, so I think that’s going to be probably the biggest competition that we face this week,” senior co-captain Jack Wyett said. 
The team is still looking for its first winning season under fourth-year coach Jeff Nygaard. After going 7-19 during his first season in 2016, the squad saw development in 2017, ending the season ranked 11th in the nation with a 14-14 record.
However, the Trojans came crashing down a season ago with a frustrating 8-20 season. The team will need to improve drastically if it wants to live up to the program’s history–the Trojans have made 14 Final Four appearances and have won four national championships since 1970, most recently in 1990.
After a 3-1 win in an exhibition match against Alberta last week, the team is hoping to channel its positive momentum into this weekend. Senior co-captain Gianluca Grasso said the Trojans are looking to continue making strides in communication and positive self-talk, which he said were strong suits in the match against Alberta. 
“We prepared really well, as if it was a big competition even though it was just an exhibition game, and I think that’ll be a great catalyst for success in the early part of the season,” Wyett said. 
As a young team, the Trojans have focused on creating a cohesive unit this season. 
“A lot of the freshmen came in with a great mentality,” Wyett said. “It’s been great, we’ve been a lot more cohesive than we have in the past and I think that’s translated into a much more intense style of play. And I think as far as competing goes, it’s been much more higher level, so we’re going to be prepared to see a lot better competition too.” 
Grasso agreed that the younger players have been a major asset to the team. 
“I think that all the freshmen that came in are super talented and for sure help us in practice,” he said. “They bring in so much potential and that just raises the level of practice every day.” 
When they’re not on the court this weekend, the Trojans will focus on team building as well.  
“We don’t quite have a set lineup right now so if we can just create as cohesive a unit as possible I think that’ll be the best takeaway from this weekend,” Wyett said.
Even so, the Trojans have high expectations for their performance.
“We’re going into this with a win mentality, we’re not really thinking about challenges or anything like that, we’re just going in with the mentality that we’re going to win every game,” Grasso said.
All three matches will be played in Honolulu’s Stan Sheriff Center.

Residents of the Cowlings and Ilium residential colleges evacuated Building 9 at USC Village Wednesday morning after smoke from a burning fire truck set off fire alarms in the building. The truck was inside Los Angeles Fire Department Station 15, which is adjacent to USC Village, said David Carlisle, assistant chief of the Department of Public Safety. 
“There was a fire truck on fire inside Station 15, and the smoke from the fire drifted over to USC Village and triggered a fire alarm, which necessitated the evacuation,”  Carlisle said. 
Firefighters extinguished the flame shortly after the truck caught fire at 5:29 a.m., the Los Angeles Fire Department said. The cause of the fire is under active investigation, and no injuries were reported. 
Some students said they could smell the burning diesel in the building as they evacuated and while they waited outside the building. 
“I think it was just the fact that you could smell smoke,” said Justin Fu, a Building 9 resident. “It was like, OK, this might not be a drill. It wasn’t very thick, but you could definitely smell it.”
After it was determined that the building wasn’t in danger, students were let back in, but only after what USC Housing senior associate director Daniel Moran called “an unacceptable delay in the re-entry process” in an email sent to residents Wednesday morning.
Once the building was cleared for entry, some students had to wait 45 minutes or more to get in because they were required to scan their fingerprints before they were let back in. Cowlings and Ilium currently house 714 residents, Moran said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
In an email sent to Building 9 residents Wednesday evening, Moran announced new emergency protocols for building re-entry in response to the evacuation. Instead of scanning their fingerprints, student residents will be able to get back to their rooms by displaying their student IDs to a resident advisor or residential college coordinator. The new protocols will apply to all five USC Village buildings that house students. 
“It was cold outside and we were already tired, so everyone just wanted to go back in,” Fu said.  “It was annoying to have to wait outside and wait for everyone to scan themselves. I’m glad to see that they actually addressed that.”

Nearly 75 health professionals from the L.A. County-USC Medical Center rallied Wednesday to call attention to human rights violations that have occured at the border.
Resident physicians across California expressed anger over the two deaths of migrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border at simultaneous solidarity rallies Wednesday, according to a press memo from the Committee of Interns and Residents/Service Employees International Union. 
Jorge Orozco, CEO of the medical center, spoke at the rally and praised his staff for their commitment to serving the community.
“I want to recognize the amazing doctors that we have at our hospital,” Orozco said. “You [can] see [their] passion … commitment and … heart [in] that they provide care to everyone who comes into our doors. Not [just] immigrants, but also individuals throughout L.A. County who are looking for the highest level of medical care and specialization.” 
Guatemalan migrant children Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, 8, died in U.S. custody after arriving at the border in December, according to CNN.
Orozco said that the tragic events at the border were “criminal” and that the hospital wanted to let the community know that it supports them. 
“I am here for just one reason and that is to let you know that these are our children — they are not foreign children,”  Orozco said. “They are our nephews, our kids, our sons, our daughters, our grandchildren. This is our community that we are serving.”
The rally occurred in conjunction with demonstrations at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, UCLA and other locations throughout California.  
“Residents at [the hospital] … are often the first medical professionals recent arrivals have the opportunity to see in California,” the SEIU memo said. “Any preventable child death is too many for resident doctors and interns who serve immigrant patients every day.” 
Julian Hirschbaum, a second-year internal medicine pediatric resident at the medical center, spoke at the demonstrations on why the matter of immigration and the passing of the two migrant children was personal to the physicians.
“Their deaths were needless and, in many experts’ opinions, preventable,” Hirschbaum said. “As physicians and pediatricians at L.A. County-USC Medical Center, we care for children like Jakelin and Felipe each day. This news hits especially close to home.” 
Hirschbaum said that pediatricians should be allowed into detention centers. He also condemned the detention of children, particularly in light of the potential lasting effects of trauma. 
“Even after children are released from detention centers, there are terrible effects including PTSD [and] mental and physical health needs that extend on into adulthood,”  Hirschbaum said. “No child or adult should have to face the conditions of these detention centers.” 
Hirschbaum said the hospital is dedicated to helping those immigrant communities in Los Angeles and that immigrants should never be afraid to seek help from health professionals. 
“Another and equally important reason why we are here today is that L.A. County-USC will continue to provide the best medical care possible to children and adults,” Hirschbaum said. “It doesn’t matter which country you come from, it doesn’t matter which language you speak either — we welcome you.”

While 2018 films had a record number of black directors, diversity in other groups remained stagnant. (Josh Dunst/Daily Trojan)
Box office hits like “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Black Panther” have brought a new wave of representation to Hollywood. As the conversation surrounding diversity in the entertainment industry continues, the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative has shed light on the matter with the Jan. 4 release of its second report on directors and executives in the film industry, “Inclusion in the Director’s Chair.”
The annual report, led by initiative director and Annenberg professor Stacy Smith, aggregates detailed analyses on directors within the film industry, based on combined demographic data of 1,335 filmmakers who have worked on the 1,200 top-grossing films between 2007 and 2018, according to the initiative’s website. Additionally, the study analyzes data on producers and other workers within the film industry. 
Smith and her team of USC graduate and undergraduate students looked specifically at diversity among these key positions and the representation of women and people of color, or lack thereof, in the past 12 years. 
Marc Choueiti,  Annenberg Inclusion Initiative’s project administrator, said there is one major finding that marks progress in the film and entertainment industries.
“Not much has changed from 2007 to 2018 except for one important deviation — the number and percentage of black directors has significantly increased in 2018,”  Choueiti said.
While the number of black directors working on top-grossing films has increased to 14.3 percent -— 2.7 times higher than 2017 — the progress for female and Asian directors remained stagnant, the study found. Of the 1,200 movies sampled for the study, 96.4 percent of directors were male and 3.6 percent were female. Of these female directors, four were black, two were Asian and one was Latina. The researchers found that Asians made up 3.1 percent of all directors in the 12-year sample. 
Jiwon Lee, a freshman majoring in cinema and media studies, was disappointed by some of the report’s findings.
“I feel like the part that shocked me the most was that there was no progress in racial representation over 12 years,”  Lee said. “I feel like it would be understandable if the study was done quite a while ago or it was just looking at a certain year, but then when you look at the whole progress of 12 years, there hasn’t been any improvement.” 
The report found that across the 1,335 directors of top-performing films in the last 12 years, the study reports that 80 were black, and of those 80, 75 were male. From the same sample, 42 directors were Asian, with only three female directors.
However, the study also found that a record number of black directors oversaw some of the highest-grossing films in 2018.
Christopher Meyer, a freshman acting major, said that while the study shines a spotlight on the progress of diversifying the film industry, there are still often too many voices that are ignored.
“The study kind of just highlights for me that when I work, I hope to be working with people from all different backgrounds so that I produce the best work that engages the most people,” Meyer said.
Ellen Seiter, a professor in the Cinema and Media Studies division, was not surprised by the results of the study. She said she often sees women working only as makeup artists, script supervisors and assistant directors when she visits sets, and when she does see successful female directors, they often got their start as part of a husband-and-wife team.
“On a deeper level, I think it is still very hard for the industry to accept a woman in charge … there are many more women directors in television and also as showrunners,” Seiter said. “But in television, the director is not as powerful a role. On the set, it is kind of a boys’ club.” 
Choueiti said the study shows that women, especially women of color, are grossly underrepresented as directors in top Hollywood films. There are, however, ways to make progress.
“Companies can set target inclusion goals, promote transparent hiring practices, adopt inclusion policies and partner with leaders on diversity and inclusion in the industry to create meaningful change,” Choueiti said.

The program, which debuted Fall 2018, received funding from the USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign and USC’s Arts in Action program. (Cecile Oreste/Daily Trojan)
Not every elementary and middle school student knows how to do the Floss, but a new USC community program is hoping to change that. For one hour a week, students from the Kaufman School of Dance teach hip-hop to classrooms of local elementary and middle school students.
Kaufman Connections, a program that launched at the beginning of Fall 2018, brings Kaufman students to 32nd Street Elementary School, which previously lacked a dance program. USC students coach classes of students throughout the semester and produce a performance at the end.
Kaufman part-time lecturer Tiffany Bong created the program to allow young students to see the impact of performing arts programs. Bong said she was heavily influenced by similar programs she participated in when she was younger.
“My whole life changed basically when I saw a hip-hop performance at my school in the fifth grade,” Bong said. “I started dancing that weekend and dancing on my own … so I understand the impact.” 
Twelve USC students, ranging from sophomores to seniors, participated in the pilot program. New and returning students will teach this semester’s program, according to Bong.
Alvaro Montelongo Ali Modad, a senior majoring in dance, instructed a class of fourth graders last semester. He said that while working with the students, he felt their confidence increase over the course of the class.
“At the beginning of course, they [were] so shy,’” Montelongo Ali Modad said. “Throughout the semester, as they acquired more dance moves and more skills and they created their own handshakes and dance moves, they were more confident to go in the [dance] circle.” 
Whenever Montelongo Ali Modad’s class had extra time, he would invite kids to teach each other dance moves, so they could learn through demonstrations.
“[There was this one kid who] did the Floss … He was so good and I was like, ‘teach it to us,’”  Montelongo Ali Modad said. “He got super nervous inside of the circle, and I was pushing him because I knew he could get it and I wanted him to get it.” 
“His face just brightened and after that, he was able to explain the movement very clearly,”  Montelongo Ali Modad said. “And I just thought, ‘Oh my God, this is the power of community.’” 
USC alumna and liaison Nelly Cristales, a second-grade teacher at 32nd Street Elementary, said the program was beneficial on both sides. 
“Each third- through fifth-grade teacher enjoyed not only the support but also learned the language of hip-hop dancing,” Cristales said. “Through the professional development, [kindergarten] through fifth grade teachers received a very enriching and learning experience.” 
The program is funded by the USC’s Good Neighbors Campaign and USC’s Arts in Action program.
“We really believe that young people in the South L.A. area in school deserve an opportunity to be connected with the arts,” said William Warrener, a USC consultant who works with the Arts in Action program. “Exposure to dance … has such an amazing impact on a person’s well-being.” 
Because funding is limited, the Arts in Action program does not plan on financially supporting Kaufman Connections next year, Warrener said. However, he said Arts in Action will be looking for other resources in the community to fund Kaufman Connections.
“Knowing that there are now a number of faculty across the art schools at USC [that are] doing this sort of school work, we’re really interested in developing the conversation … to help them stay there,” Warrener said.
Bong said she is actively looking for other resources to help with funding in the future. She also said that this year is a pilot year for the program and hopes to replicate the experience with other schools. Kaufman Connections might create an after-school program for middle schoolers or integrate performing arts throughout elementary, middle and high school. 
“We don’t just want to come in and leave,” Bong said. “We want to build alongside them.”
