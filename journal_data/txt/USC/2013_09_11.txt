With the start of the new school year, the USC Dornsife Unruh Institute of Politics has also launched a new program called “Legislators in Residence,” which features former State Senator Tony Strickland and former State Assemblyman Anthony Portantino as on-campus student mentors.
“I’ve seen how much USC students benefit with not just academic experts, but policy officials who have worked in those areas. But we’ve always been limited by the fact that the guests are only at campus for a particular lecture or panel discussion,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute of Politics. “So I’m particularly excited about the opportunity to get students to build a relationship with real-world policymakers.”
Strickland represented the 19th District from 2008 to 2012 as State Senator; prior to that, he served in the State Assembly from 1998 to 2004. During his time in the Senate, Strickland worked to bolster California’s faltering economy, including passing legislation aimed at making the state more energy efficient.
“I think I can bring a wealth of knowledge in terms of my experience to young kids who want to be involved in public policy and public service,” Strickland said.
Portantino represented the 44th District in the Assembly from 2006 to 2012. Before that, he served as mayor of the city of La Cañada Flintridge. Reputed to be a maverick legislator, Portantino spent much of his time in office pushing for government reform.
“For me, it was very exciting to be given an opportunity to create longer contacts and actual relationships with students who are working on these policy endeavors over a longer period of time,” Portantino said.
As part of the “Legislators in Residence” program, Strickland and Portantino will be teaching a class alongside Schnur entitled “The Future of California.” Students in the class will have a chance to discuss current policy issues facing California with not only Schnur and the two legislators, but also weekly speakers.
“I’m really going to enjoy interaction with the students and really get a good discourse in terms of public debate and public policy, so hopefully it’ll be a part of some ideas that will take their voices back with me when I go back, so I can develop them and help solve some of these problems,” Strickland said.
Interaction with Strickland and Portantino, however, is not reserved solely for Unruh students. Both legislators are also open to speaking to any student organization. On Wednesday, they served as panelists at the first “Students Talk Back: A Weekly Politics and Public Policy Forum,” which was co-hosted by the Schwarzenegger Institute.  In addition, Portantino is scheduled to make an appearance at the College Democrats meeting on Oct. 2; Strickland will do the same at the College Republicans meeting on Oct. 22.
President of the College Democrats Catherine Shieh expressed excitement about the new political life “Legislators in Residence” will bring to the USC campus.
“A big theme that I witness in politics is that a lot of people have a negative view of politics. But part of that negative view of politics is that politics is not seen as accessible,” Shieh said. “With that being said, when you have not one, but two people that are permanently on campus, that puts in this accessibility factor that wasn’t there before. It’s the first step of really getting your foot in the door.”
The two legislators will hold office hours at PSD 101, during which any interested student can set up a meeting with them.
Though Strickland and Portantino have each committed to just a year to USC, but they have big plans and hopes for the young Trojans with whom they will be working.
“My goal is to rejuvenate myself from being around positive energy in the classroom, but then also to help channel that positive energy into serious outcomes for the state,” Portantino said. “Because today’s 22-year-old — today’s 18-year-old — ten years from now, is going to be tomorrow’s leader.”

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism hosted a panel in the Gould School of Law Wednesday afternoon to discuss legal policies and actions surrounding space travel.
The event was organized by Alex Kaplan, a second year student in the USC Gould School of Law and president of USC’s Space Law Society.
Rita Lauria, a professor at Annenberg and the founder of the legal firm Metalaw®.US, Julie Jiru, an attorney at SpaceX and Matthew Schaefer, a professor at the University of Nebraska served as panelists at the discussion on the future of space law as a legal field.
Space law is becoming increasingly important as more and more private companies invest in the space travel industry. SpaceX’s goal, for example, is to eventually enable people to live on other planets, according to its website.
Though all three panelists spoke on the same subject, each had a different perspective and area of expertise.
Jiru discussed the Space Act Agreement, a law that enabled the development of the fledging space transportation industry that exists today. Prior to 2004, collaboration between the government and private space firms was possible but, according to Jiru, was limited by the government’s Federal Acquisition Regulation contracts, which  placed too much stress on young space companies.
“[A] Federal Acquisition Regulation contract is anywhere from 100 pages to 1000 pages, some are 2000 pages, some are 3000 pages, and it goes on,” Jiru said. “If you’ve worked with a FAR-based contract, you go by the mantra that you are not allowed to launch your launch vehicle unless your contractual paperwork is as heavy as that vehicle that you are trying to lift.”
Though legislation around space travel has since changed, companies interested in launching a spacecraft still face many liabilities.
“When it comes to third party liability, the current U.S. regime is this: The U.S. government requires the space operator to get insurance up to the maximum probable loss,” Schaeffer said. “The [Federal Aviation Administration] has a way that they calculate through a complex formula.”
Schaefer argued that government inaction and indecision, particularly in promising insurance coverage, was creating an unhealthy climate within the space industry.
“The government promises to take care of the next $2.7 billion, but it would take an active Congress and an actual appropriation to do it,” Schaeffer said. “Here is the bad thing: Congress has started promising that [amount] for lesser and lesser periods of time. That is tough on the industry for planning purposes.”

Another segment of space law, known as metalaw, looks at framing international law in the event of contact with extraterrestrial intelligent life.
“Metalaw seeks to establish a regulatory scheme for outer space that considers the possible existence of other intelligent life and that could be used to help regulate interactions between such possible life forms,” Lauria said.
Though metalaw focuses only on possibilities and not actuality, Lauria argued that the speed of technological advances and the slow pace of the legal response necessitated the urgency to speed the process to start considering actuality.
Even though the event was specifically about space law, some students saw it as an opportunity to learn more about law in general.
“From an undergraduate perspective, this was a good opportunity to get exposure to law, not to mention space law,” said Mabel Tsui, a senior majoring in communication. “Based on the information I have heard, it seems this is a fast-growing area of law.”

Richard Wike, associate director of Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, gave a presentation on global opinions of the United States on Wednesday at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Global view · Richard Wike, associate director of Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project, speaks as Professor Robert Banks looks on. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The event, hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy (CPD), took place from 12 to 1 p.m. Accompanying Wike was Annenberg adjunct professor Robert Banks and CPD Director Jay Wang. The event was part of the center’s Conversations Series.
Wike’s discussion largely focused on statistics collected from the most recent Pew survey. Wike said, however, that the point of the study was not to make policy recommendations or offer ways to remedy issues.
“We don’t tell the government what to do,” Wike said. “We put the information out there, and we rely on the smart people out there to find the next step.”
Of all foreign countries, Italy was the most positive toward America, and Pakistan the least, with 85 percent of those surveyed disapproving of America.  In terms of regions, sub-Saharan Africa was the area that found America most favorable.
“Bush was pretty popular there,” Wike said.
Wike also brought up the idea of an “Obama effect.” The data pointed to an increase in American favorability after Obama’s inauguration. The effect, however, has not touched all areas.
“Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan are countries that really haven’t seen an Obama effect. Favorability spiked up a little bit in Turkey [after his election], not a great rating,” Wike said.
Not all areas of American culture were viewed equally, according to the survey. American media and technology were held in high regard. American ideas and democracy were met with hostility.
“They do want their American music and TV,” Wike said. “The flipside is that they worry about it pushing out their own local customs and traditions.”
Presenters had different opinions on the statistics.
“Some of these statistics were evocative. Some were surprising. Some were reassuring. Some were depressing,” Banks said.
During the discussion portion of the event, the audience, largely comprised of Annenberg graduate students, asked questions on topics ranging from methodology to effects of the survey.
Wike seemed particularly interested in the aspects in which American favoritsm is weak, such as the topic of drones strikes.
“There are some countries where we have seen some difference [within demographics]. But overall patterns we do not see it. The one place where we see a big difference is drone strikes. When we ask the drone question we get big gaps,” Wike explained.
Military-based questions also elicited mixed results..
“The most [interesting thing] is how [many] Americans see China replac[ing] America. Forty-seven percent say yes, 47 percent say no,” said Ian Koo, a graduate student in the public strategy and relations program. “I [would] think that Americans would be more confident.”
Wike’s presentation included a segment on opinions of China and whether or not it would become the next superpower.
“In the spring of 2008, before the economic crisis really kicked in, 20 percent were saying China, and 47 percent [were] saying the U.S. [would be the superpower]. In this year, the China numbers came up substantially, and U.S. numbers drop,” Wike said. “This is a big change in only a five-year period in what Europe thinks is the world economic leader.”
Yating Zhao, a graduate student from China in the communication management program, was particularly curious about the data on China.
“I think the most interesting part was that he mentioned that the image of China is increasing. Lots of people think China will one day replace the United States in the world,” Zhao said. “When I was in China, a lot of Americans thought China was the biggest threat. I got it from the real data, so it was very impressive to me.”
The full discussion, along with a one-on-one interview with Richard Wike conducted by Lauren Madow, a graduate student in public diplomacy, will be posted to the CPD website, uscpublicdiplomacy.org on Monday.

Students gathered to discuss issues of race, gender, and class in an informal, guided discussion and workshop called “Plug-In” at Ground Zero on Wednesday night.
The Ground Zero stage was deconstructed and the room was set up in a format that would facilitate discussion, with all students on an even surface. The event was co-sponsored by the Political Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the Latino/a Student Assembly, the Queer People of Color Club and Lambda Upsilon Lambda, Fraternity Inc.
Taylor Markey, a senior double majoring in neuroscience and philosophy, helped to plan the event as a co-director of the Women’s Assembly.
“The objective of Plug-in is to bring what is normally an elevated conversation down to a level that everyone can relate to and talk about,” Markey said. “Plug-in is meant to give USC students the tools to be activists in their everyday lives in small ways, especially in language and in conversations with other USC students, to give them the ability to stand up for themselves and for other marginalized groups effectively, and not feel silenced by comments that they hear.”
The event began with an introductory workshop on collective liberation and intersectionality. Leaders began by asking what traits belong to the term “privilege.” Student responses included terms such as males, whites, able-bodied, educated, fit, conventionally attractive and citizens.
Leaders then asked what terms were associated with the word “oppressed.” Students responded with queer, black, lesbian, Muslim, incarcerated and veterans, among others. The objective of this exercise was to inform people that everyone has multiple identities and that a person can’t feel safe unless every element of one’s identity is respected.
Plug-In sought to initiate collective liberation with the USC community by discussing and accepting these different identities of students.
The first workshop was on gender. Leaders began by yelling out offensive remarks, and students worked together to come up with responses. The workshop followed this with the issues of catcalling, and what women can do in response.
The gender workshop also focused on issues relating to gender identity, and discussed the terms of gender, cisgender, transgender and preferred gender pronoun, as well as questions of sex and sexuality.
“I am cisgender and privileged: I have the ability to walk through the world and blend in without being pointed at, laughed at and stared at,” moderator Melissa Villafranco said.
The second workshop on racism was introduced by Professor Sharoni Little, associate professor in the USC Marshall School of Business.  She began by discussing the terms of invisibility, visibility and hypervisibility.
“Does the construct of race get constructed with certain privileges in America?” Little asked the group.
Almost every student in the room nodded in affirmation.
Christina Davis, director for Residential Education, moderated the workshop. She asked students if they feel comfortable on campus, and if they think students of color feel safe on the USC campus. Students responded with stories of fear and hurt they’ve experienced as students of color on campus.
“I feel more safe off of campus than on campus,” said De’Ron Marques, a senior majoring in public relations. “Being a black student at USC, I fear DPS, I fear not being able to get onto campus at night. We are few and far between. I feel like I’m not welcome here.”
Students of all colors shared their experiences with the room, as listeners clapped and snapped in response.
Katrina Miller, a freshman majoring in English, recalled her experience at Welcome Week in August.
“The events were mostly white, and I didn’t see many DPS officers,” Katrina said. “But when I went to my first black event, and I saw like five USC officers, I questioned, ‘Are you serious?’ I couldn’t believe DPS always came to black events.”
The event concluded with a workshop on class, and what it means in society today.
“I hope students leave with a better understanding and a larger perspective on the issues that are racially intensified, and that are across different socioeconomic statuses on campus,” said Program Board’s Speakers Director Monica Parra.

In my comment, which was conveniently removed TWICE from this article, I mention that DPS doesn’t discriminate between events based on the race of the people attend. I guess the DT Moderation Committee didn’t get the subtle hint that I have friends in high places at USC. 
Complaint memorandums have been sent to the USC Office of the President and USC Student Government.
Also, an official complaint has been filed with the USC Office of Equity and Diversity. 
Thank twice before deleting just comments and trying to push an agenda.
“Being a black student at USC, I fear DPS, I fear not being able to get onto campus at night. We are few and far between. I feel like I’m not welcome here.”
I couldn’t believe DPS always came to black events.”
Please, not this again. I know DPS very well and I know they do not discriminate between events based on the race of the attendees. If you are going to feel this self-conscience about your race, you might as well just attend Howard University. USC does more for the nearby community, which is predominately Latino and African-American than any other Los ANgeles organization. Did you know the Pertusati Bookstore is the only bookstore in a 9 mile radius? Did you know that, starting this year, they will be carrying SAT and other college prep material to further help the community. This is just one, small example. 
Secondly, the bias and tone of this author is seeping through the lines. Instead of complaining about these issues and saying how “racist” and “homophobic” USC is, why don’t you define the word “cisgender?” Why don’t you discuss how soo manly LGBTQ and African-American groups receive more Senate funding than other student organization? Or about the massive amounts of cash and scholarships and grants that they are sitting on and underusing in their nice, plush, cashmere office couches while constantly complaining that USC isn’t doing enough for them or the community.
The only bookstore in a 9 mile radius, are you serious? You obviously do not know how to utilize a map. The following bookstores are within a 9 mile radius of the University: Moca Bookstore, The Last Bookstore and Caravan Bookstore to name a few. Please do not tell LIES to try and further your false propaganda. 
Second, African-American groups DO NOT receive more funding than other student organizations. Funding is based on the size of your constituency. In fact, the University’s BSA receives the LEAST amount of funding out of all the minority student organizations on campus (which only represent about 4% of this University’s population). So please, spare me!
I am assuming you are not African-American, so please do not try to speak to the experience of African-Americans on this campus because you WILL NEVER know what it is like to walk in our shoes. Instead of being closed minded and comfortable in your white privilege, wake up and look around you!
Side-note: If you are going to bash this article and entire communities at this prestigious university know your facts and learn how to spell! I cited several grammatical and spelling errors in your comment.

For all the talk and predictions about the lackluster Trojan offense, the outcome of this week’s contest against Boston College might just be decided on the other side of the ball. The Eagles are bringing a potent offensive attack into the Coliseum on Saturday headlined by three seniors in running back Andre Williams (318 rushing yards, 5.5 yards per carry), quarterback Chase Rettig (68.5 completion percentage, 171.5 QB rating) and receiver Alex Amidon (239 receiving yards, two touchdowns).
No problems here · The Trojans’ defense has been dominant in both matchups this season, recording six interceptions and 11 sacks. Torin Harris (4) is one of five players to notch interceptions for USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Eagles are under new leadership this year, with head coach Steve Addazio taking over for Frank Spaziani. Addazio has installed a  scheme that focuses on establishing the run before opening up the field with a play-action pass attack.
“[The Eagles’ offense] is totally different, obviously,” Kiffin said. “What we can tell is that they’re very physical, they play with great effort, their running back is a load, their receiver makes a bunch of big plays, and their quarterback is very accurate.”
Rettig, entering his fourth year as the Eagles’ starting quarterback, has thrown four touchdowns and just one interception.
Amidon, an All-ACC pick last year, is currently second in the ACC with 239 receiving yards and two touchdowns off of 18 receptions.
But it is Williams who has keyed the Eagles to their first 2-0 start in three years, after they only won two games all last season.
Last year, Boston College was one of  just eight teams in the FBS to average less than 100 rushing yards per game while Williams battled injuries in the second half of the season. But Williams is healthy now, and he’s third in the FBS with 318 yards on the ground.
Quest for Consistency 
One of the defensive backs who will be tasked with shutting down Rettig, Amidon and the rest of the Eagles passing attack will be senior cornerback Torin Harris. Harris is coming off of what many consider to be the best game of his career, as he picked off a pass and deflected two more in the loss to Washington State as he filled in for junior Anthony Brown, who started against Hawai’i before suffering an injury that kept him out against the Cougars.
“Torin has had a lot of inconsistency since I’ve been here,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said. “For a long period of time that’s been the most consistent stretch that he’s played. His skill set does allow him [to be a defensive headliner]… He’s got a chance to be a really good corner and improve each week.”
Harris and the rest of the defense will have to continue their dominant play if the Trojans are going to have a chance to come out on top this weekend. The Eagles have been compared to Stanford or even an SEC team with the power offense they utilize, and will certainly be the best rushing attack the defense has seen up to this point.
“I feel like we’re always ready,” Pendergrast added. “We’ll have our hands full but we’ve come out and executed the game plan two weeks in a row now. We’ll have to execute at a high level again.”
“Play for your buddy” 
That’s the mindset that redshirt junior linebacker Hayes Pullard says has inspired the defense this season, and it seems to be working. The Trojans are ranked first in the country in sacks (11) and rushing defense (15 yards per game, 0.6 yards per carry).
Still, Pullard and the rest of the team know they can not rest on their laurels.
“We have to improve on the little assignments,” Pullard said. “We have to work on staying assignment ready.”
The Trojans’ defense was near perfect last Saturday against the Cougars, but its one major mistake was costly, as missed tackles on a screen pass led to the eventual game-winning field goal. This week, the Eagles will try to bait them into making similar  mistakes, so the Trojans will have to stay disciplined every play.

Social media platforms were inundated with tweets and posts about a perceived conflict regarding coach Kiffin being left out of the loop on a players-only meeting that star receiver Marqise Lee claimed happened on Sunday night.
But according to Kiffin and a number of other players, no such meeting ever occurred.
For Kiffin, it was somewhat of a joking matter.
“I haven’t been on social media this morning.” He added with a laugh: “for good reason.”
“I don’t know why Marqise said that,” Kiffin said. “I asked him why he said that and he said he was kind of just in front of you guys (the media) and got flustered.”

USC basketball head coach Andy Enfield landed his biggest recruit yet for the Trojans on Wednesday, as highly touted point guard Jordan McLaughlin committed to USC after visiting the school last weekend.
The 6-foot, 165 lb. recruit from Etiwanda High School in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. chose USC over national powerhouses Kansas, Indiana and crosstown rival UCLA, signifying that Enfield is already putting the Trojans on the national radar before coaching his first game at Troy. It also lifted USC’s recruiting class to being ranked 16th overall and second in the Pac-12 by 247 Sports.
McLaughlin was ranked as the nation’s No. 4 point guard and No. 18 overall in the class of 2014 by ESPN, who rated him as a five-star player. Scout and Rivals both list him as a four-star player and rank him as No. 36 and No. 43, respectively, overall.
With three of USC’s guards graduating after this season, many think that McLaughlin is the guard of the future for the Trojans and their up-and-coming program.
“Jordan McLaughlin … the best prospect to sign with USC since DeMar DeRozan,” ESPN high school scout Joel Francisco said via Twitter.
One of his new teammates and future backcourt running mates didn’t waste any time in congratulating him on his commitment.
“Congrats to my little bro and future Trojan … Welcome to the family,” UNLV transfer Katin Reinhardt, who will sit out the upcoming season, said via Twitter.
McLaughlin is definitely a big proponent of Enfield’s fast-tempo, NBA-style “Dunk City” offense.
“It’s really exciting and it fits my style of play,” McLaughlin told Rivals on Wednesday. “They want to get up and down [the court] and score in the first eight seconds. They set a lot of ball screens, run NBA sets, they play good defense and throw lobs.”
The signing of new assistant coach Tony Bland was another part of the program’s successful pitch to McLaughlin, who already has a relationship with Bland.
“I’ve gotten to know him really well since he was at San Diego State and I’m excited to work with him,” McLaughlin said.
Even though McLaughlin had official visits lined up for UCLA and Kansas in October, he decided to commit early. It had been rumored USC had been McLaughlin’s top choice for quite a while.
The decision is a big hit to UCLA coach Steve Alford’s recruiting class, as several sources report he was heavily pursuing McLaughlin. For that reason, McLaughlin’s commitment is sure to be extra gratifying for USC fans.
McLaughlin joins power forward Malik Price-Martin, who committed in late July, as the second four-star recruit to be committed to USC in the class of 2014. The last time the Trojans signed two four-star recruits was in 2007, when they landed Davon Jefferson and O.J. Mayo.
As he noted himself, McLaughlin’s style of play seems to resonate perfectly with Enfield’s system.
“He is very quick with a great burst off the dribble that allows him to blow by his defender with ease on offense,” Ryan MacDougall of GalenCentral.com said of McLaughlin. “Along with being a strong scorer, McLaughlin has shown consistently that he can dish out nifty assists.”
National college basketball insider Jon Rothstein of Yahoo! Sports pointed out that Enfield is building for year two of his tenure with the talented personnel he will have at his disposal in the 2014-2015 season.
“USC’s potential starting perimeter in 14-15: Jordan McLaughlin, Katin Reinhardt, Byron Wesley,” Rothstein said via Twitter.
With excitement already building around the new culture of the program, and two scholarships remaining for the 2014 recruiting class, Enfield will now turn his efforts toward another recruiting battle with Alford and UCLA — Mater Dei five-star small forward Stanley Johnson, another five-star prospect that has college coaches drooling.
Johnson, a 6-foot-6, 220 lb. Fullerton, Calif. native, is ranked as the No. 1 overall prospect in California and the No. 12 player in the country.
Johnson lists both USC and UCLA among his top choices, but hasn’t yet scheduled an official visit with either Los Angeles school. Right now he only has visits to Arizona, Kentucky and Florida on his agenda. But with the addition of McLaughlin to USC’s ranks, that might change soon.

Nineteen.
That’s how many USC home football games I had attended in my three years as a student here before Saturday. Six of those were losses. Some of them were bad losses. Some were frustrating beyond belief. Some were maddening beyond description.
I’ve seen the Coliseum crowd shocked after wide receiver Ronald Johnson let a potential game-winning touchdown slip through his fingers in the rain against Notre Dame in 2010.
I’ve seen it heartbroken after running back Curtis McNeal fumbled inside the 5-yard line to end the Trojans’ quest to upset Stanford in 2011.
I’ve seen it exasperated after USC put up 51 points against Oregon last season, only to give up the most points (62) and yards (730) of any team in Trojan history.
But I’ve never seen it like it was on Saturday.
It’s a sentiment I’ve heard echoed by many over the last few days. Every fan, employee and media member has seen USC lose, and lose much worse (on the scoreboard, at least) than on Saturday. But still, this one felt different.
“Embarrassed” is the first word that comes to mind, and the word I’ve heard thrown around most in the aftermath.
But simple embarrassment doesn’t cause fans to boo a team off the field at halftime or audibly chant for the head coach to be fired. No, that’s something else. That’s more than embarrassment, frustration or humiliation.
That is anger.
The Coliseum was angry, and made it known. This campus is still angry. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever experienced following a defeat here.
After any given USC loss, I can usually pop on social media and see posts such as, “I’d rather lose as a Trojan than win as (insert winning team here).” Not after Saturday. I didn’t see or hear one single “Win or lose, we still booze.” Nothing about how it’s still great to be a Trojan — just a lot of disbelief and frustration.
And anger.
How else do you describe fans openly booing the team into the locker room?
How else do you describe the “Fire Kiffin” chant that echoed through the Coliseum as the clock wound down?
How else can you describe the feeling in there on Saturday?
It’s coming from more than just fans. Without getting into specifics about what was said up the tunnel after the game, believe me, there was plenty of anger there as well. Players don’t come to USC to lose six games a season, or to ever lose to Washington State — a team that hasn’t had a winning record since 2003, has lost 49 games in the last five years and, as a reminder, is Washington State.
As the saying goes, “You win some, you lose some.” Such is the nature of sports. At USC, however, the expectation is that you win a considerable amount more than you lose. And the reality is this: USC is 8-7 since the beginning of the 2012 season. They are 2-6 in their last eight games. In the four games since Matt Barkley’s injury at UCLA, they have scored five offensive touchdowns.
We can argue forever about the morals of booing your own team, especially when that team is comprised of amateurs. But it’s hard to blame fans for making their feelings heard after Saturday’s debacle. There are people at this school who couldn’t explain a football concept as basic as a handoff, yet could draw a detailed diagram of a bubble screen.
The “definitive” choice of a quarterback should help, especially from a game plan standpoint. USC head coach Lane Kiffin will be able to better tailor the offense to sophomore Cody Kessler.
And of course, the defense has been outstanding, surrendering just 14 points in the first two games while recording 11 sacks and seven takeaways, and giving up an amazing 0.6 yards per carry.
The talent is there for this team to play with almost any opponent. But then again, that was the case last year, too. And Saturday’s loss felt a lot worse than any of the six suffered in 2012 — ask anyone who was there. The feeling permeating from the stands was totally foreign, but also completely undeniable: Anger.
And somehow, no matter what happens this Saturday — lose by three or win by 30 — I don’t think it’s going away.

It did not take long for the defending national champion USC women’s golf team to pick up its first win of the fall season. The No. 1 Women of Troy erased a three-stroke deficit on the final day of the Dale McNamara Fall Preview to move past several tough teams and secure a victory to begin their 2013-14 campaign.
Up and down · The Women of Troy were tied for eighth place after the first day of play, but sophomore Kyung Kim shot 4-under par (66) in the final round to help claim the team title for USC, as well as the individual title. – Courtesy of Tulsa Sports Information
It was truly a comeback for the Women of Troy, who finished Monday’s opening round at Tulsa Country Club tied for eighth place, 10 strokes behind the leaders. Fortunately, dominating play from sophomore Kyung Kim and inconsistency from several opponents helped the squad claim its fourth straight victory dating back to last spring.
Once again leading the way for the Trojans on Wednesday was the red-hot Kim, who picked up her second career individual title. The sophomore shot a blistering 4-under 66, her third straight round in the 60s and the ninth such round of her young career. Kim finished the tournament at 6-under overall, two strokes in front of Oklahoma State’s Julie Yang, Alabama’s Stephanie Meadow and Arizona State’s Noemi Jimenez.
After taking the first two days of the tournament to get back into the swing of things, senior Sophia Popov found her groove on Wednesday. Popov shot a 2-under 68 in the final round, lowering her overall score to 5-over and moving her behind only Kim for USC’s best score.
Popov’s initial struggles and eventual breakthrough mirrored her team’s experience.
“We fought really hard out there to get that ‘W’,” Popov told USCTrojans.com. “We struggled the first two days so it was great to show the other teams today that we belong up there and have just as strong a team as we had last year. Today’s round showed the potential our team has and we hope to keep the momentum going.”
No. 3 Duke, which began the day atop the leaderboard, struggled down the stretch in the final round, opening up chances for several top teams to take the crown. Ultimately it was the Women of Troy, behind strong play from Kim and Popov, who outlasted No. 4 Oklahoma and No. 16 Oklahoma State.
Freshman Gabriella Then was again solid in her collegiate debut, finishing 2-over for the round and 6-over for the tournament. The rookie was a picture of consistency, bookending 16 consecutive pars with bogeys on holes one and 18. Behind Then was sophomore Annie Park, who couldn’t match her 2-under 68 from round two. The defending individual national champion finished the day at 4-over, raising her three day total to 7-over.
It will likely not be the last time USC takes on this tough group of opponents, which also included No. 2 Alabama and No. 6 Arkansas. The Trojans also hope it will not be their last trip to Tulsa this school year — the NCAA championships return to Tulsa in the spring for the first time since 1999.
The Women of Troy return to action in three weeks, when they will travel to the Chicago area for the Windy City Collegiate Classic at Northmoor Country Club. There they will attempt to capture a fifth straight team victory, breaking a record established by the national championship squad from 2008.

It’s that time of the year again: when magazines’ September issues are in full throttle, models frantically rush from show to show and designers put the final touches on their lines. It’s the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.
The event, which started last Wednesday, occurs mostly at Lincoln Center, but also takes place in trendy areas around New York. The week is notorious for starting the season off right. Heavyweights from the industry grace the front rows of all of the most popular shows, and celebrities flock to check out the new trends for the upcoming season.
Since the move from Bryant Park to Lincoln Center and other locations determined by the designers, it seems like they have started to play with the scenery of their catwalks and are not just relying on the traditional white runway. Tommy Hilfiger created a beach scene. Opening Ceremony chose to channel The Fast and the Furious. Alexander Wang included geometric shapes to accent the shapes of his garments. These intentional, artistic scenery choices by the designers only add to the ambience of their shows.
Alexander Wang is the king of reinventing women’s essentials with a sultry twist. He has always leaned more towards sportswear for his collections, but this year, he played with sheer panelling, leather crop tops and preppy, V-neck pullovers. Wang also played with blacks and whites, but also included pastels, such as rose and lavender. Wang’s spring line was heavily influenced by formal menswear through the inclusion of collared shirts and tailored shorts, but by changing the cuts of the traditional piece, he is able to modernize the look for the 21st century woman. The natural makeup choice for the models included a bold tangerine lip and sleek hair. It is always a pleasure to see how he decides to dress his adorable niece, Aila, for his shows and this season, her “Parental Advisory” shirt, leather skirt, and Jordan slides were too cute to handle.
Another designer who grabbed a lot of attention was Tadashi Shoji. His main focus is on gowns, and the intricate beading and lace work of his dresses are elegantly and thoughtfully executed. Her concept for this collection was the powerful woman who doesn’t need to rely on business attire to showcase her strength, but instead can display strength by embracing her femininity. Shoji is definitely a name to remember, especially come next year’s award season.
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s line, The Row, seems to be made for the ultimate chic nomad who wants attire for traveling to the French Riviera and Tunisia, then back to the dreamy deserts of Dubai this season. The entire show transports the audience to another place — a pleasurable experience that shows fashion is truly an art form. They embraced prints and depended on drapery that worked not only for high fashion, but was versatile for everyday wear. It’s easy to forget that their claim to fame was acting, not fashion designing, because both of their lines The Row and Elizabeth & James, have come to command respect in the industry.
The masterminds behind Rag & Bone, David Neville and Marcus Wainwright, are the kings of urban, tomboy style for women. The leather, slouchy kilt was a definite eye-catching piece that was hard to stop thinking about when reviewing their show, and it is remarkable how designers are able to juxtapose hard elements, such as leather, with soft pastels and feminine accents to complete their looks. Reminiscent of the ’90s, the crop top combinations with overalls, skirts and sheer blouses were a treat. Their color palette usually tends to be more muted and natural, so seeing the sleek hair away from the face was refreshing. Their show serves as an example as to why designers shouldn’t be afraid to play with makeup and color; it definitely can provide the necessary push to make outfits shine.
Y-3, by Yohji Yamamoto has already perfected the art of urban wear and transformed it into elegance. Yamamoto’s spring line defines the “it” guy who just knows how to do everything right. Suave and a brilliant dresser, the ideal customer is aware of both of these characteristics. Thus, it was no surprise to see designer Jeremy Scott in the front row.
Scott’s women’s line this season was also an eye catcher, especially because he was able to successfully pull off sporty, feminine looks that didn’t seem like someone was trying too hard to channel their inner ’90s diva — a trend that seems to be staying for next spring.
This year, model veterans ruled the catwalk, and audience members at Diane Von Furstenberg’s presentation had the pleasure of seeing Naomi Campbell grace the runway.
The start of Fashion Week seems to have been a success. Fashion fans must now wait and see what the city of London will bring later this week.

It’s hard, sometimes, being a fan of television on the West Coast and being on Twitter. Perhaps no night is more difficult than Sunday during the hours leading up to a new episode of Mad Men or Breaking Bad. To put it bluntly — my feed becomes a giant scroll of spoilers.
To their credit, many of the people on the East Coast whose accounts I follow tweet rather cryptic spoilers. They don’t reveal the big themes. Instead, they leave me wondering about the little things, like for Don Draper, what could possibly be so painful about a Hershey’s bar? A well-meaning West Coaster, what am I to make of a “Lena Dunham is running … OMG” tweet, hours before I’ve even begun to sit down to watch the finale of Girls?
They’re small spoilers — but they’re still spoilers, nonetheless.
This probably reached its most annoying point during MTV’s Video Music Awards a few weeks ago. Yes, I’m talking about that time Miley made twerking happen. Since the broadcast was tape-delayed on the West Coast, the twerk heard ‘round the world and the arguably more important *NSYNC reunion were both spoiled hours before I could watch them from the comfort of my own couch.
But I’m not complaining — well, I suppose I am. Just a little bit, though.
The truth is that spoilers have always been inevitable. They certainly existed long before the advent of newer tools for communication, such as Twitter, Tumblr or Facebook. Then many of the spoilers took place in verbal conversation (to think such a thing existed!), however, back when one could interrupt another to prevent the spoiler from rolling off the tongue. Though that admittedly is not foolproof, it still allowed for greater proactivity and preemption.
It’s harder to escape spoilers today, when no warning is given that the next tweet on your feed is about Breaking Bad or the next Facebook post is a quick meme revealing a new plot twist from insert-buzzed-about-TV-show-here.
But there is still hope. When researching this column, my friend pointed me to an interesting Internet browser extension called “Tumblr Savior.” It allows users to block out certain keywords from appearing on their feed if they haven’t seen a television show or a sporting event. For example, my friend, who is still catching up with Breaking Bad, has used the extension to eliminate “Breaking Bad,” “Walter White,” “Jesse Pinkman,” “Bryan Cranston” and “Aaron Paul.”
Though Tumblr Savior and similar apps don’t completely eliminate or shield us from the fear of spoilers, they sure go a long way toward alleviating the concern, or at least controlling it.
Since I’m writing about spoilers, I’d be remiss not to mention that the changing ways in which we consume television (and even episodic film) has brought a new type of spoiler to the fray.
No matter how devoted a binge-watcher you might be, it’s difficult to deny that consuming an entire show at once changes the experience of watching. Don’t get me wrong — the ability to stream entire seasons of television is great. It’s just different and brings its own spoilers along with it.
This type of spoil has less to do with revealing an aspect of an episode’s plot but has more to do with the way the show is watched. It’s the spoil of building less of an investment with the show.
To varying degrees, television series require a certain investment from its viewers. Each week, an audience must make the time to watch a show when it airs on television or make alternative plans, such as recording it with a digital video recorder or streaming it on the Internet. But that’s not the case for a series that has been posted online in its entirety. It eliminates the investment a viewer must make to watch the show and the attachment that results.
Not only does this type of spoiler erode the physical investment that once was required for TV watching, it also diminishes the emotional investment that one makes with the journey of the characters.
Not too long ago, I had an interesting conversation about the way in which my views on Walter White had changed with each season of Breaking Bad. I mentioned that I had once looked at Mr. White as someone who was doing a good thing for his family. The person I was talking to never saw the now infamous high school chemistry teacher-turned-meth dealer that way. She’d caught up on the show all at once rather than watching each week.
And it makes a difference. Watching a show that’s not available for an entire week forces the viewer to chew on the information given to them in the previous episode, therefore enhancing the emotional attachment between the audience and a character.
It represents a different type of spoiler than the more referenced type that reveals bits of telling information, but it’s only one of the many new spoils that have resulted from evolving modes of communication and media consumption.

The music world’s favorite sci-fi songstress is back. Janelle Monáe, who dabbles in everything from neo-soul to experimental, released her second studio album, The Electric Lady, on Tuesday.
Right on the Monáe · Janelle Monáe’s second album for Bad Boy Records is a musically varied follow-up to 2010’s The ArchAndroid. – Courtesy of Bad Boy Records
Though Monáe has been making ripples since 2007’s Metropolis: The Chase Suite, she first achieved mainstream success on The ArchAndroid, her 2010 effort that featured singles such as “Tightrope” and “Cold War.” Since then, major cosmetic labels such as Covergirl and major publications Essence and Vibe have plastered her unabashedly independent look all over commercial advertisements and magazine spreads.
Needless to say, this growing attention is not just the result of Monáe’s innovative musical stylings. Instead, her modern take on the afro-bouffant and signature tuxedo uniform have earned her recognition for her unwillingness to achieve success based on her body type — though in videos such as 2008’s “Many Moons,” she certainly proved she had the physicality and choreography to keep up with dance sensations like Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake.
In addition to her distinctive visual presentation, Monáe stands out by incorporating narrative-driven plots into her albums. Her debut EP, Metropolis: The Chase Suite, started exploring the futuristic romance between human Anthony Greendown and android Cindi Mayweather. Monáe takes listeners many decades into the future, where relationships between humans and androids are strictly forbidden. And as bounty hunters chase down Mayweather in order to separate her from Greendown, she tells her story in CD installments — all of which listeners are privy to.
Now, The Electric Lady continues Suites IV and V of Monáe’s sci-fi saga. Interludes such as “The Chrome Shoppe” and “Good Morning Midnight” feature robotic disc jockeys “getting [their] chrome polished” and anonymous callers who just want to give a shoutout to “the droid rebel alliance.”
Die-hard fans will soon realize, however, that this third effort represents a slight departure from the artist’s previous releases. Though Monáe usually delivers an experimental mix that can feature everything from rock to R&B, The Electric Lady features a more unified sound. Summer teasers such as “Q.U.E.E.N. (feat. Erykah Badu)” and “Dance Apocalyptic” set the tone for the album’s funk-infused elements, and themes of self-empowerment echo through many of the tracks.
“The ArchAndroid focused on self-realization: realizing your superpower and the things that you’re capable of doing,” Monáe said in an August interview with BUST magazine. “With The Electric Lady, we’re talking about self-actualization: being the change you want to see … The album deals with a new breed of woman.”
The Electric Lady kicks off with “Suite IV Electric Overture,” one of Monáe’s standard instrumental openings that features heavy guitar riffs and ominous strings, just to prime listeners for the album’s moody yet uplifting overtones. The album then launches into “Givin’ Em What They Love” (feat. Prince), a modern take on the funk standards of the 1980s. Though she’s delivering verses right next to Prince’s famous falsetto, Monáe holds her own against this music icon. Her throaty yet calculated “yeahs” and “alrights” prevent her from letting “The Artist Formerly Known As” steal the spotlight.
But Prince isn’t the only superstar Monáe teams up with for The Electric Lady. Solange Knowles, Esperanza Spalding and Miguel also make appearances on the album. Spalding gets Monáe to slow the pace a little on the jazzy “Dorothy Dandrige Eyes,” and Miguel delivers a hazy vocal line on the light-hearted R&B ballad, “Primetime.” As she performs effortlessly with some of today’s biggest artists, Monáe proves she’s not just the girl from Kansas City anymore.
Even among a series of noteworthy tracks, a few knockouts stand out. “We Were Like Rock and Roll” could easily become a single with its catchy chorus, expressive lyrics and wailing electric guitar line. Likewise, “Look Into My Eyes,” which calls to mind The ArchAndroid’s “Sir Greendown,” features chilling harmonies and a haunting otherworldly vibe ripe for slow dancing. The track also offers a higher, cleaner vocal sound from Monáe, who softly sings, “May our love be so brave and so true,” just before the song fades out.
In addition to the emotionally vulnerable lyrics on tracks such as “Look Into My Eyes” and “It’s Code,” Monáe also delivers confident rap stylings and spoken word on numbers such as “Ghetto Woman” and “Dorothy Dandridge Eyes.”
“But even when she felt like she couldn’t, she carried on,” raps Monáe on “Ghetto Woman.” “She couldn’t imagine both of her daughters here all alone / Before the tuxedos and black and white every day / I used to watch my mama get down on her knees and pray.”
Equally female-empowering and fast-paced monologues appear on “Q.U.E.E.N.,” which showed fans that the talented singer had multiple sets of vocal talents with its release last May.
“You can take my wings, but I’m still gon’ fly,” raps Monáe on “Q.U.E.E.N.,” which defines Monáe’s confident persona for the rest of the album. “But even when you edit me/ the booty don’t lie.”
And Monáe certainly doesn’t lie. The Electric Lady represents a major milestone for an artist who has already earned Grammy nominations and media attention for her energetic dance performances. The 19-track album satisfies fans who have been anticipating a worthy follow-up to The ArchAndroid, and even with some small changes to her style, die-hard listeners will have a hard time denying the cohesive masterpiece that is The Electric Lady.
Monáe can’t stop “givin’ us what we love.”

In a world filled with rapidly advancing technology, it seems as if there truly is an app for everything. Or at least there was. On Sept. 3, the app “Ghetto Tracker” made an appearance in app stores. Its life span was short, abruptly disappearing just two days amidst intense backlash and criticism.
The app was designed to do exactly what its title implies: It allowed users to locate and avoid areas deemed “ghetto” in any given city. In other words, it allowed elitists to steer clear of the lower-class “villains” of society.
Not surprisingly, Ghetto Tracker failed almost immediately after its launch due to criticism of its racist nature. The controversial app served to reinforce the widespread notion that low-income areas are places that completely lack anything positive and thus, should be shunned.
The first problem with this app is its name: Ghetto Tracker. The term “ghetto,” in its prevalent modern form, is defined by Merriam-Webster as “a quarter of a city in which members of a minority group live especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure.” The app tracked down these minority-dominated areas and flagged them in order for others to avoid them. In this sense, Ghetto Tracker clearly served as a racist tool in averting the poor and minorities.
What’s even more offensive about it? The information utilized by Ghetto Tracker was not gathered from FBI crime statistics or similar official data analyses; rather, it was the subjective assessment of neighborhoods by middle and upper-class individuals that quite unjustly labeled entire areas as unsafe due to  underprivileged criminals.
Some might defend Ghetto Tracker because it allegedly allows users to simply avoid unsafe areas regardless of racial and social implications while visiting an unfamiliar city. This defense would have sufficed, provided that the information used by the app in determining which areas were “ghetto” and which were not was derived from legitimate measurements of crime rates rather than from user partiality stemming from pure prejudice.
By disregarding official crime-reporting statistics, Ghetto Tracker allowed for the categorization of entire poor and crime-prevalent areas as undesirable and dreadful to outsiders, thus damning all of their low-income residents as delinquents socioeconomic situations.
Within a day of the launch of Ghetto Tracker, the app’s name was hastily changed to “Good Part of Town” in an attempt to counter criticisms. Perhaps with this name and legitimate government statistics, the app would have been successful. With the way the app was launched, however, changing the name to Good Part of Town did little to help alleviate explosive tensions surrounding the situation.
In fact, the name change only reinforced the fact that the “good parts” of town are those in which wealth and Caucasian homogeneity flourish, and that anywhere composed of a poor minority demographic is obviously a “bad part” of town.
But if all of this still doesn’t seem sufficient to deem Ghetto Tracker as a prejudiced app, then consider the header photo that welcomed users to the app’s web page: a photo of a smiling, well-to-do Caucasian family, insinuating that white folks do not live in the “ghetto.”
The app creators tried to ameliorate the problem by changing the photo on their company website to a black family sitting together in their living room sporting cheerful smiles, hurriedly swapping an all-white photo at one end of the racial spectrum for an all-black one at the polar opposite doesn’t make their app any less racist. It only reinforces the vile nature of designing an app for which the primary user constituency is of the Caucasian, privileged background wanting to avoid less fortunate, “dangerous” individuals of African-American and other backgrounds.
Ultimately, what the app brings to light are the dire issues of socioeconomic class divisions and the blind racial prejudice that sadly continues to plague this country. The app reinforces the overpowering misconception that poor communities overwhelmingly composed of ethnic minorities are wholly dangerous and undesirable. Affluent, predominantly Caucasian neighborhoods are without exception pleasant areas, further propagating the notion that these areas can almost always be understood to be safe and favorable.
Social inequality still occurs in this nation, as emphasized by the implications made and reactions garnered by Ghetto Tracker. Until these socioeconomic gaps can effectively be lessened, racial and social tensions will continue to mount within almost all aspects of American society, from politics to media to everyday technologies.

“Ghetto Tracker application” article further reinforces the stupidity of “journalists”.
Really now, this nation is being run into the ground by liberty crushing folks in Sacramento and Washington DC, WWIII is about to start, and we have a freakin’ comet about to put us in it’s crosshairs…but you are writing about the name of a tool that was created to help keep people out of a crappy part of town.
You clearly have never even used our “app” since it’s not an app and it’s not racist.
Any college writer who starts a piece with “In a world…” truly needs to read more and stop watching bad Hollywood movies…
I think what mostly disturbed people about “Ghetto Tracker” was that it crystallized a hidden truth that most of us harbor – but we are always uncomfortable when someone shouts out loud that the Emperor is not wearing any clothes. I have heard many USC students give advice to out of town friends and family which areas of LA to avoid. This is done without any guilt or remorse (since it is not done publicly) and there is a knowing nod WHY and WHO you will be avoiding.
These same people are the ones that loudly and publicly admonish something like “Ghetto Tracker” because – well because that is what we have been taught to do now in this scared, politically over-correct society – where our fears, prejudices and brutal honesty is covered up by the most duplicitous, saccharin veneer of politically correct lies. We know we feel it – but to say it out loud and be honest about it is why many Americans care more about what Paula Deen said a lifetime ago then what happened in Benghazi a year ago.
BTW – the same people who make their obligatory disdain for “Ghetto Tracker” known for public theater, are the same ones who seek the kind of information Ghetto Tracker would compile, if they visit an area they are not familiar with.
I am not saying the app developer does not have a tin ear for what is viably marketable in our scared times. I also understand the stigma of growing up in an area constantly being labeled as “Ghetto”. However – first, I would get over it. Second, that would give me a lot of incentive and energy to work hard and get out of the dump. But let’s not pretend we are on such high moral ground that our superior sensibilities are racked by even the notion of an app called “Ghetto Tracker”. Like I said, most of us have personally played the role AND and sought the services of such an app already.

“Ghetto Tracker,” a stupid and insensitive name, bound to generate strong approbation for its racist connotations. Perhaps it should have been named “Dangerous Area Avoider” or “Rough Side of Town.” I never saw this app, but it might have been helpful for tourists and newcomers to an area to avoid being endangered, or even robbed and murdered. Possibly the developer will reissue it with a more objective and acceptable name.

The United States federal government has operated without a fiscal year budget for four years and 135 days. The last time both houses of the United States Congress agreed on a budget was April 29, 2009, when the Senate voted on party lines to give final approval to the budget for the 2010 fiscal year. To put it into perspective, that was when the USC class of 2014 was preparing for their high school junior prom.
Emily McPeek | Daily Trojan
 
In the interim, lawmakers have abandoned the domestic agenda to haggle about the best way to keep the government’s lights on. Not only is this an embarrassing reflection on our country to the rest of the world, but the divided nature of our House also means that budget woes are resolved at the expense of domestic policy goals such as immigration reform. The effect of such budget haggling is also international in nature: What will Congress do if it faces an international emergency and simultaneously must compromise to avert impending fiscal doom?
Unfortunately, it seems like America is about to find out.
The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 outlines the procedure for passing budget resolutions: They are crafted each spring (or they are supposed to be) to lay out specific plans for spending, taxing and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years, such as deficit closing goals and long-term savings plans. If the budget resolutions in the Senate and the House are not uniform, a conference committee made up of members of both houses is tasked with ironing out the differences.
The abandonment of a budget is a disturbing trend. The impending government shutdown in 2011 was used by House Republicans as a political tool to force almost $40 billion in spending cuts, which virtually wiped out the stimulative effect of the previous year’s payroll tax cut. In July of 2012, Congress successfully punted the budget crisis forward with minimal effects. In January, President Barack Obama took time away from his vacation to sign via autopen a law to prevent the fiscal cliff, a deadly combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases, from ravaging the U.S. economy. Those automatic spending cuts ($85 billion in total) took effect on March 1, and will be completed next month.
CNN reports that Oct. 1, 2013 is the new government shutdown date. This time, an international crisis in Syria threatens to derail negotiations on most pieces of legislation — meaning quick cooperation, a rarity on Capitol Hill, is a must. The first thing lawmakers must do is pass a continuing resolution by Oct. 1, which will be difficult if the GOP follows up on rumors that it will include a provision to repeal Obamacare. It would be the 41st time such a rider immediately killed a piece of legislation.
Even if that does pass, that does not get us out of the woods. Lawmakers must immediately raise the debt ceiling, or the limit on federal borrowing, which is currently set at $16.7 trillion. Otherwise, according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, the Treasury will no longer have the resources to keep the U.S. default at bay. The Treasury will immediately delay payments such as veterans’ benefits and social security — and it could all be because of a dysfunctional Congress in the midst of a debate about Syria.
The warped budget process must also be fixed in the context of reforming broader fiscal policy. Annual budgets will do no good if the government continues to run an annual deficit, and if that deficit adds to the mounting national debt. The fiscal cliff that nearly struck in January will look like an economic speed bump in comparison to the unsustainable trend of debt spending year after year. Perhaps Congress abandoned the budget process because the last annual fiscal plan allocated more than 25 percent of its expenditure to interest on the national debt, a dismal statistic publicized by the documentary I.O.U.S.A.
Congress should not stop debating Syrian intervention. But Congress must recognize national and foreign emergencies will need to be solved from time to time, and they cannot be solved effectively if Congress is stuck arguing about fiscal policy every three months. The dangerous fiscal path we have been on for the last four years sends the perception to the world that Congress is lazy and divided. Returning to the process of passing an annual budget will ensure Congress does not get caught with its pants down in the midst of an international crisis.

The idea that there is a “budget fight” is laughable. Our income is “x” and our spending is “2x”; there is no budget; there is no fight.
