On Tuesday, USC returned to practice, beginning preparation for an emotional rivalry game against UCLA. 
Still important
With the Trojans having already clinched a spot in the Pac-12 Championship as a result of last week’s win at Colorado, it may seem like the team has little incentive to show up against an unranked UCLA team. After practice, head coach Clay Helton insisted this was not the case. 
“I think this game is so important for us and our seniors, when you look at it,” Helton said. “The Victory Bell is something that’s truly special to this University. We understand how important this game is to our fan base.” 
Helton noted that a win on Saturday would give seniors, such as senior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu and redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins, an undefeated record against UCLA at the Coliseum (last time the Bruins visited in 2015, the Trojans won 41-20). Helton compared the cross-town rivalry to his own experiences as a college quarterback. 
“I’ve been at Auburn University when I played as a young person,” Helton said. “You see that Auburn-Alabama rivalry and how special it is, and there’s a lot of these rivalries that are real special. I love this one because it’s so unique, because we live in the same town. Really when you think about the rivalries around the country, they’re miles and miles apart. Here we live right across the street from each other.”
For redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, this will be his first time going head-to-head with UCLA’s fellow NFL draft quarterback prospect Josh Rosen in a much anticipated battle for supremacy in Los Angeles. 
“I think when it comes down to it, it’s just two quarterbacks competing,” Darnold said. “We just happen to be two pretty good players.” 
Defense shines 
USC’s defense looked to be energized on Tuesday, forcing numerous interceptions in a pass skeleton drill against both redshirt freshman quarterback Matt Fink and Darnold. 
The unit even returned two interceptions for touchdowns within the span of minutes, one by redshirt sophomore cornerback Jalen Jones and the other by redshirt senior safety Matt Lopes. After each pick-six the defensive sideline erupted in celebration for their teammates. 
Holding serve 
When the College Football Playoff rankings were released during practice last week, the Trojans received a pleasant surprise moving up seven spots to No. 11. 
In this week’s standings, USC remained at No. 11 despite plenty of chaos ensuing in the college football world. Two fellow two-loss teams that were ranked behind them last week — Ohio State and Penn State — both leapfrogged the Trojans in this week’s edition. Despite an underwhelming position in the rankings, the team is holding out hope for a potential playoff run, even though the chances are very slim. 
“Oh that’s definitely on our minds,” junior running back Ronald Jones II said. “We want to go to the best bowl game possible … but the goal is to win a national championship.”

The USC women’s basketball team improved to 2-0 on the season on Monday night after handling UC Riverside on the road, 64-46. 
One major question surrounding this year’s Trojans team was who would emerge to replace the 3-point production of Courtney Jaco, a star senior on last year’s squad and one of the most prolific shooters in program history. 
Head coach Mark Trakh may have received his answer in junior guard Aliyah Mazyck. The Charlotte native drained four shots from long range in the first half, finishing with a team high 21 points in the game. So far on the year, she’s already averaging 19.5 points per game with a 47.5 percentage from behind the 3-point line.
In addition to Mayck, whose shooting helped propel USC to a 16-point halftime lead, senior forward Kristen Simon played a solid game. She went an unsuspecting 4-for-7 in field goals, but dominated on the boards and reached the free throw line with ease (she was 10-of-15 from the line). 
Simon’s 18 points and nine rebounds in just 21 minutes nearly gave her the 19th double-double of her career. Behind her efforts on the glass, USC out-rebounded the Highlanders, 39-29. 
After exploding for a career high 30 points in the season opener against Montana State, senior guard Sadie Edwards had a more quiet night on Monday, finishing with 6 points and one assist, but her presence alone helped free up other offensive options such as Simon and Mayck. 
Sophomore point guard Minyon Moore operated as the team’s primary distributor and defensive irritant, dishing out six assists and recording four steals. As a team, USC finished with 12 steals and forced UC Riverside into 20 turnovers. The Highlanders’ Michelle Curry provided some offensive spark for her team scoring 19 points, but overall the Women of Troy prevented her team from mounting any consistency on offense. UC Riverside went 19-of-51 on field goals, shooting 15.4 percent from 3-point range. 
It was a suffocating defensive performance from USC, but the Trojans still have plenty of issues to clean up on the offensive side moving forward. Every player who logged at least 10 minutes turned the ball over and seven recorded multiple turnovers. Meanwhile, after landing 13 3-pointers as a team in the opener, USC struggled often from deep on Monday. The usually reliable duo of Moore and Edwards combined for just one 3-point make. 
Next up, USC will stay on the road for a contest with Santa Clara this Friday before returning home to face Long Beach State next Monday.

The No. 14 women’s volleyball team hits the road for two of its final three regular-season road matchups at No. 4 Stanford and Cal on Wednesday and Friday. 
USC (20-7, 12-4 Pac-12) is coming off a five-match win streak, tying its longest of the season. The first time the Trojans met the Golden Bears (13-14, 4-12 Pac-12), USC won in four sets. Two days later, when they played the Cardinal (22-3, 15-1 Pac-12), Stanford won in four sets. 
For Stanford, a win against the Trojans would mean that Stanford would clinch its first Pac-12 title since 2014. Sitting at 12-4, USC has a one match hold over Washington for second place. If the Trojans beat the Cardinal, USC could have a chance to tie for the title if it wins out its season. 
To give the Cardinal their second conference loss of the season, USC will need to rely upon sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier. This past week, Lanier was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week and the AVCA National Player of the Week. It’s Lanier’s third conference award and her first AVCA National award, and USC’s 10th in program history. 
Lanier picked up 38 kills while hitting .319 and averaging 4.22 kills per set in the team’s four-set win over then-ranked No. 15 Utah and five-set win over then-ranked No. 25 Colorado. 
Other than Lanier, USC continues to depend on senior opposite Brittany Abercrombie. The senior put up 27 kills this past weekend. Freshman outside hitter Brooke Botkin put up 24 kills while hitting .256. Senior opposite Niki Withers put up 21 kills while hitting .304. 
The team’s balanced attack helped to push the Trojans over the Utes and Buffaloes this past weekend. To try and top the Cardinal, they’ll need a continued presence from the four pin-hitters. 
For the Cardinal, USC will need to limit sophomore outside hitter Kathryn Plummer. Against the Washington schools, Plummer put up 48 kills while hitting .329. She is the Cardinal’s go-to offensive weapon. While it could be tough to limit Plummer, USC could focus on making an impact at the net against the rest of Stanford’s hitters, similar to what the Huskies did in their four-set win over the Cardinal — their first of the season — just a week ago. 
To top the Golden Bears, the Trojans will need to shut down senior outside hitter Antzela Dempi. The senior hit 29 kills against the Washington schools. She also put up four service aces. The last time the two teams faced each other, Dempi put up 12 kills. 
With four regular-season matches to go, the Women of Troy should be able to hit their stride as they prep for the NCAA Tournament. 
After the matches against Stanford and Cal, USC heads out to Oregon to face the Ducks before hosting UCLA for its final regular match of the season. 
At Maples Pavilion on Wednesday, the Cardinal and the Troajns will celebrate Equality Night, where they will celebrate inclusion and diversity in sports. First serve will be at 7 p.m. On Friday, the Women of Troy play the Golden Bears at 6 p.m.

Both senior guard Jordan McLaughlin and junior forward Chimezie Metu took spots on a list of the 50 top candidates for the 2018 John Wooden Award. The list, which was released on Tuesday, was based on a preseason poll of the national NCAA basketball experts who will vote on the award at the end of the season.
McLaughlin has been a captain for the Trojans for three years, and he is expected to strongly lead the No. 10 ranked squad this season. He is currently ranked second on the program’s all-time assists list with 457 and is well on track to set the record this year. 
Last season, McLaughlin averaged 12.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists. He ranks first in career assists and career steals, second in career points and third in career 3-pointers made among all players returning to the Pac-12 for this season.
Metu is an equally vital player for the Trojans, starting all 36 games last season while averaging 14.8 points and 7.8 rebounds. He came alive in the final 13 games of the season, spiking to an average of 16.9 points and 8.2 rebounds and starring in the Trojans’ postseason run.
The Wooden Award recognizes the top player in men’s college basketball every year. Last year’s recipient was Frank Mason III, an All-American guard for the Kansas Jayhawks who also picked up AP Player of the Year, the Naismith Award and the USA Today Player of the Year Award.
Polling for this year’s award will continue throughout the season, and players not selected for the preseason list can still make their way into finalist contention. The organization will release a midseason list and late season list before releasing the top 15 players in the National Ballot during postseason play.

Duncan Day | Daily Trojan
Let’s face it. The Los Angeles Chargers are in a pretty deep hole when it comes to their playoff chances. Once assumed to have greater odds than the Los Angeles Rams to win this year’s Super Bowl, head coach Anthony Lynn’s crew sits in a concerning position, boasting a measly 3-6 record, following an overtime loss, 20-17, to the Jacksonville Jaguars.
The question is, how well does L.A. have to perform for Lynn to keep his job? In order to have a better idea of the answer, understanding the AFC West’s current outlook is necessary.
Right now, the Chargers are battling the Denver Broncos for the AFC West’s third-place spot behind the Raiders and Chiefs. The Raiders are in danger of slipping with a 4-5 record, as they face the New England Patriots this week in one of their toughest games of the season.  And the Broncos continued their downward spiral, falling hard to the Patriots, 41-16, on Sunday night. 
The AFC West, no doubt, isn’t living up to the hype it captured in 2016, but for the Bolts, and specifically Lynn, that’s actually a good thing, since the division’s second-place team may not end up with a flashy record.
At this point, it’s clear an 8-8 record would probably be the best-case scenario for the Chargers. Therefore, Lynn finishing the season very strong means losing two games or less. The remainder of the Bolts’ schedule starts with a home game against the Buffalo Bills this coming week, and they will then hit the road to play the Dallas Cowboys. 
The good news for the Chargers is that they can bolster their plan of attack against the Bills by borrowing from the game plan of the New Orleans Saints, who crushed Buffalo on Sunday, 47-10. The Chargers will have the luxury of encountering the Cowboys without their star running back, the suspended Ezekiel Elliott.
The Bolts would really set themselves up to succeed by defeating both Buffalo and Dallas. Because then, they have a extremely winnable contest against the winless Cleveland Browns. In a tougher stretch of competition, the Chargers take on the Washington Redskins at the StubHub Center and then have to deal with Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs. 
If Lynn can notch a three-game winning streak up to this juncture, and that’s obviously up for debate, I would see an end to his run coming versus either Washington or Kansas City. 
My line of thinking is particularly important for Lynn because a three-game victorious streak makes that 8-8 record much more plausible. 
The main goal becomes simple after three victories in a row: win two of the last four games. And the last two regular season meetings, post-Washington and Kansas City, are against the New York Jets and the Raiders. The Chargers have proven they can defeat Oakland, while the Jets are certainly beatable.
The main issue for someone predicting this 8-8 record for the Chargers is their unpredictability over the course of the season. Quarterback Philip Rivers’ possible absence for this week’s contest, due to a concussion he reported on Monday, fortifies this uncertainty. Rivers has started 185 consecutive games and tried to win the 2007 AFC Championship against the Patriots. His competitiveness and sheer amount of experience on the field are vital keys to the game that the Chargers are going to be hard-pressed to replace. And with the nature of concussion injuries, it’s completley uncertain at this time how long the quarterback will be unavailable to play.
“To be honest with you, I don’t even really have an experience with him not being out there,” longtime Chargers’ tight end Antonio Gates said of Rivers.
From the optimist viewpoint, even if Rivers’ on-field leadership and talent heavily contribute to the heart and soul of his side, backup Kellen Clemens is a veteran that knows the Chargers’ offense well. 
And as long as defensive stars Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa are healthy, Lynn should be in position to keep these games close. Every time I watch Bosa and Ingram push the limits of opposing offensive lineman, I realize just how lucky the Chargers are. With an average pass rush, Los Angeles’ defense would not be the ninth-best NFL unit in points allowed.
The bad news for Lynn is that a few injuries could derail the hopes of an even record. There becomes such a fine line between an 8-8 team and a 5-11 team. It’s usually a pretty consistent lack of execution from September to December that causes 10 or more defeats in an NFL regular season.
On the grounds that the Chargers trend in the wrong direction and are looking at a very favorable first-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, a couple looming thoughts will exist. Lynn will be on the hot seat for sure, but he could survive for another season. His draft pick may be used to take a quarterback, considering the 2018 class is deep and a 34-year-old Clemens isn’t a franchise QB.
Rivers’ exit is almost certain by the end of 2019, ending an era for the Chargers. The excursion to being a playoff team before the North Carolina State product is gone starts now.

To kick off Thanksgiving break in true holiday and school spirit, The Price is Right will air its annual college rivals Thanksgiving episode, where USC will take the hot seat against Notre Dame.
Currently hosted by Drew Carey, The Price is Right is a classic televised game show where contestants compete in games that test their knowledge of consumer goods and pricing in hopes of winning prizes that include luxury cars and paid vacations. The show’s college rivals episode follows the same format, except the four contestants consist of two college rivals and the audience is filled with spirited students and alumni from the represented schools. All four contestants bid on the prize presented; the winner joins Carey on stage and the contestant from their rival college returns to their seat in the audience. If contestants on stage lose their pricing game, the contestant from the rival school wins $1,000.

USC’s contestant is Alexis Bradby, a senior majoring in media arts and practice. Bradby is a resident assistant at Parkside Arts and Humanities Residential College, through which she heard about the opportunity to be on the show.
“CBS reached out to USC looking for 15 participants to be part of a special episode: The Price is Right’s college rivals special,” Bradby said. “The Residential Education office received the notification, and they held a lottery among interested RAs to find the 15 participants.”
Bradby, however, wasn’t only drawn to the show for the sake of being on television; competing held emotional value for her, too.
“I’ve watched The Price is Right since I was a little girl with my baby-sitter who has since passed away,” Bradby said. “From a young age, I’ve had a love for the show, and, like most people, when watching the show at home, I was always like, ‘I could do that.’”
Bradby’s appearance on The Price is Right won’t be her first time competing on a gameshow either. In the past, she’s attended Let’s Make a Deal as an audience member twice, which she enjoyed “especially for the costumes and Wayne Brady.”
When commenting on her overall takeaways as a contestant on the show — without giving away any details of the episode’s outcome in adherence to her confidentiality agreement — Bradby reflected on her demanding, but rewarding experience.
“Pre-production is very tiring and takes the majority of the time,” Bradby said. “You have to wait several hours before the show begins, and you want to be high energy the whole time, which makes the process exhausting … [But] The Price is Right is a really fun show to watch or attend as an audience member. It’s really big on community because everyone is rooting for each other to win.” 
Alongside Thanksgiving preparations, USC students and alumni are encouraged to tune into CBS on Nov. 22 at 10 a.m. to cheer on their fellow Trojan as she competes against a Notre Dame student for cash prizes, school pride and bragging rights. 
Add some pumpkin pie into the equation and this episode is a holiday treat you won’t want to miss.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Bradby had competed on Let’s Make a Deal twice. She actually attended the show as an audience member. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Focusing on the beauty of ice and the connection between the environment and humanity, the project builds upon SCA Ph.D. candidate Clea Waite’s longtime passion for the intersection of art and science. The culmination of Waite’s two-year project will be available for public viewing until 6 p.m. Friday.
As artistic signature of Waite’s work, Ice-Time promises a mesmerizing experience for viewers. The installation consists of multiple screens hung throughout the room. Each screen shows a different film reel captured in Greenland by Waite of various types and angles of ice formations — from tiny cracks and bubbles in the ice to aerial satellite views of ice sheets in Antarctica.
Equally as important as visuals in the immersive experience is sound; the gallery swells with the audio of the movement of the ice depicted in the video footage. To record various sounds such as ice cracking or water flowing through a glacier, Waite used a hydrophone, a contact microphone placed directly into water or onto ice to record its vibrations. 
One of the central motifs of Ice-Time is movement. Viewers see and hear the movement of the ice through the project’s visual and sound design. The constant transition of video clips and audio in the gallery from avalanches to water gently flowing through an ice sheet, also contribute to the exhibit’s emphasis on movement. Additionally, the layout of the screens intentionally keeps the viewers moving throughout the exhibit. 
“There’s not really any one place in here where it would be comfortable to see everything,” Waite said. “That’s because I want you to be part of the film so you’re constructing it in your movement through it and your attention to it.”
Along with its attentiveness to artistic details, Ice-Time incorporates Waite’s scientific knowledge of ice and highlights Waite’s interdisciplinary approach to art and science. For instance, the layout of the outer screens of the exhibit not only appear artistic but also intentionally form a hexagon to represent the molecular structure of ice. In addition, visuals played on the screens that contribute to the overall aesthetic also depict various scientific aspects of ice not usually seen. Such visuals range from the structure of lab-grown ice crystals to cryoconite holes made by dark-colored dust hotter than the ice that settles on the ice. 
More importantly, the intersection of art and science in Waite’s installation helps establish ice as a tesseract of time through strong visuals and scientific background knowledge. In other words, Waite portrays ice as a container of Earth’s past and the evolution of Earth up until now. For instance, one part of the video clips projected on the exhibit’s screens shows ice cores, samples of ice obtained by drilling down through ice sheets. By doing so, scientists can examine the changing properties of the different layers in the ice cores formed as ice accumulated over time. 
“If you see all the stripes in [the ice cores], those are years, like [in trees],” Waite said. “The chemistry of the air and different sediment will settle on the ice and [the ice] gets covered every year and it gets compressed down over time. Scientists look at that and can tell the atmospheric record of the Earth going back 800,000 years through these ice cores.” 
Above all, Waite uses the connection between ice and time in her project to present climate change to viewers and advocate for environmentalism. Throughout Ice-Time, Waite utilizes the accelerated movement and changes of the ice to convey a sense of urgency.
“Time is the thing that we are losing control of with the climate,” Waite said. “Ice is this record of time. It’s so hard for us to really experience it because glacial time is much slower than human time, You sit there and you don’t realize anything is happening and then you play back the footage and fast forward and all kinds of stuff happen.”

Here’s a helpful test to determine your suitability for the Daily Trojan: Do you enjoy getting recognized for your achievements? Do you wish for your accomplishments to be acknowledged? Do you want others to credit you for your hard work? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, then college journalism may not be right for you. 
It’s no secret — indeed, it’s become kind of a running joke — that, other than the poor fools who slave over it day in and day out, no one with an ounce of sense or a semblance of a social life pays any attention to the school newspaper. I’d be forced to deploy both hands in order to count the number of times someone has asked me, “Does anyone actually read the Daily Trojan?”
No. No one reads the Daily Trojan. Every article is just an exercise in navel-gazing. We produce content for the void. 
OK, so I’m a drama queen. But it’s true that it’s hard to imagine anyone logging into our site on the daily except us, our sweetly supportive parents (Hi, Mom and Dad) and a handful of disgruntled middle-aged white men who have dedicated their lives to single-handedly tearing down the liberal college bubble in the comments section.

Five nights a week, I am hunched over in the newsroom, erasing a comma here, inserting an em dash there, laboring over minutiae, the reason being, I can only assume, to preempt an especially astute reader from sending in an angry manifesto lamenting the sloppiness of student journalists these days and that the quality of this paper has gone to seed. This commitment to excellence and conscientious attention to detail recently won the DT a Newspaper Pacemaker Award. It is, I promise, very prestigious. 
If I’m being totally honest, if the test was a real gauge of fitness, I am fundamentally unsuited for the newspaper. I crave validation, absolutely live for the moments when people tell me they enjoyed my writing. I get unduly excited when someone reads my column of their own volition, without me shoving the link in their face. I’ve yet to resort to promoting my pieces on Facebook, but that’s mostly because my aversion to sharing on social media overpowers my hankering for “likes” and “great job!”s. 
Yet, despite my bellyaching, here I am. It’s a thankless job, sure, but a gratifying one as well; the two are not mutually exclusive. Labor-intensive as it is, I am proud of my exertion of effort, proud that the finished product is clear, concise and Oxford comma-free. And an audience is nice, but not requisite, for me to derive meaning from the process of coaxing my thoughts out of my brain and onto the page. But it’s nice. 
If you’ve made it this far, then you must understand: My continued insistence on churning out content is made possible by readers like you. Thank you.
Kitty Guo is a sophomore majoring in journalism and computational linguistics.  She is also the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Kitty Corner,” runs every other Wednesday.
I am not a journalist myself (archaeology major), but I do pick up a copy of the paper every day to see what is going on. I appreciate the hard work you all put in and I can definitely see how you feel you are yelling into an empty well. I have heard this from many journalism friends of mine but if it makes you feel better- thank you for all the work you put in and I am proud of you girlie!
If it’s any small consolation, I too am a college journalist who spends night after night working on a paper I’m almost positive no one reads. I related to this article more than I can put into words, as I’m sure many student journalists can, down to the constant erasing and inputting of commas and endless berating of middle-aged white men ruling the comments section. 
Yet here I am, lying in my bed on my laptop and checking the Daily Trojan just for the Lifestyle section and, of course, the Kitty Corner (I’m a sucker for cats and for columns, so you got me twice).
From one Lifestyle Editor to another, you’re doing great.
(But who listens to journalists anyway?)

I don’t intend to study law, so I don’t have the same strong feelings about the LSAT that so many aspiring attorneys feel. I can see the rationale for allowing law school applicants to use the GRE in their applications, and in many ways it makes sense — it lowers the barrier for entry to application, it allows applicants to master’s and Ph.D. programs to use the same test for J.D. programs, it saves people lots of money, etc.
With that said, there are still benefits to having sector-specific testing requirements for applications to particular types of schools. Different trades have different jargon and different intellectual cultures, and it’s hard for a universalized test to do justice to the whole range of knowledge between fields. That’s why sector-specific tests were set up in the first place.
Take the MCAT for medical students. Most medical schools require it for applications, as it covers a broad range of medicine-specific knowledge necessary for medical students upon entry into the profession. Moreover, medical students will be studying things that their peers in master’s and Ph.D. and J.D. programs, for the most part, will never have to use.
Law is closer to the rest of the humanities than medicine is, but it nonetheless is still a highly technical field, with a specific set of intellectual skills required for its practice. A brief survey of practice questions for the LSAT, versus practice questions for the GRE, reveals the differences in thinking and logic expected of law students. For some of us non-pre-law plebeians, the LSAT practice questions seem like pointlessly technical sophistry. But in reality, they are designed to reflect the real technical nature of the course material law students will undergo in their courses and eventually in their profession.

This isn’t to argue that the GRE is less sophisticated or less valuable. It is to say, however, that the GRE is simply not as specifically tailored to the demands of law as the LSAT is, and implies a different, broader set of intellectual skills. When law schools begin accepting the GRE in lieu of the LSAT, they expect to receive applications from a cohort of applicants who studied for a different test, and are thus intellectually prepared in different ways than they were before. This poses some important questions for law schools’ purpose and action in the broader educational and labor force training contexts.
The blog Above The Law reports that market forces have largely been driving the shift toward law schools’ acceptance of the GRE — in a post-recession world where fewer and fewer graduates apply to law school in the first place, it makes sense to reduce the barriers to entry in an attempt to attract more applicants to fill spots in the programs.
But this implies that the law itself, if it is not in its current form attracting more talented students and applicants, might need some kinds of internal reforms to stay relevant and attractive to America’s best and brightest. This is not unique to law. Technical fields in the “applied humanities” neighborhood — for example, the officers’ corps in the U.S. Armed Forces, the diplomatic and intelligence professions, even academia — have been losing applicants in recent decades as the best and brightest go to the private sector for work. However, rather than simply changing their barriers for entry, some of those professions have made changes to benefits systems and job quality, and even to their recruitment and marketing, to attract the top crop of American graduates.
I don’t have any specific recommendations as to how law schools could accept more talented people. But a few things — for example, the skyrocketing costs of law schools, the prospect of some aspects of legal work being “boring” and “unrewarding,” the scarcity of the more desirable sorts of legal jobs — seem to turn people away, at least in my anecdotal experiences talking to pre-law students. Figuring out how to develop a better deal — a better “social contract” of the profession, if you will — may be helpful not only for law schools but also for bar associations themselves.

I’m currently studying for the LSAT. It’s not a exactly a pleasant experience, although positively enviable for my medical school-bound friends studying for the seven-and-a-half-hour MCAT.
I’m taking the LSAT because, like almost all LSAT-takers, I want to go to law school, and the LSAT is required for most American Bar Association-accredited law schools. But recent trends show that might be changing: Georgetown University Law Center, Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law and the University of Arizona Law School recently joined Harvard Law School in allowing applicants to submit a test score from the Graduate Record Examination instead of the LSAT. In doing so, they are proving to be pioneers in legal education, and more schools should join them.
Deborah Rhode, a professor at Stanford Law School, called law “the least diverse profession in the nation” in The Washington Post in 2015. She spoke largely to attrition at law firms, but diversity in the profession is impossible to achieve if minorities continue to be underrepresented in law schools. Research published in the ABA Journal by Debra Cassens Weiss found that diversity in law school is increasing, but not at the most prestigious schools. The GRE can help: De-emphasizing the singular LSAT score might pave the way for greater consideration of important and diverse life experiences, which can lower barriers for minority applicants and those with disadvantaged backgrounds. 
The move to accept the GRE instead of the LSAT is good for the LSAT, too. The competitive pressure challenges the test to continue to innovate and argue its relevance for producing good lawyers. If law school admissions rely so heavily on the LSAT, it should be for good reason — and so these recent challenges will require the LSAT to prove its worth. That can only be a good thing; the LSAT will identify its weaknesses and work to create a better, more applicable test.

The shift also underscores a shift in attitudes toward standardized tests in undergraduate and graduate education. More than 900 colleges and universities in the country no longer require SAT or ACT scores for undergraduate admission. This move largely hopes to offer nontraditional students a way to prove their worth without standardized testing that give privileged students an advantage; reports of racial and socioeconomic bias on the SAT, for example, further indicates to these schools that there may be some implicit factors in standardized testing that confound the results by measuring true intelligence. This is an important question to explore in testing at the graduate level, including the LSAT and the GRE. The LSAT may be an accurate predictor of a student’s first-year performance in law school, but how closely does that relate to their abilities to be effective lawyers? Maybe it does — more research certainly suggests this — but it’s still possible that the emphasis on the LSAT might exclude potentially great lawyers; and given the recently plummeting interest in law school, these educational institutions should be lowering barriers, especially artificial ones.
There’s another positive impact of accepting the GRE. The problems of our world are becoming increasingly complex; they require innovative, interdisciplinary solutions. And graduate-level education should allow for those opportunities. Dual-degree programs — M.D./Ph.D., for example, or J.D./M.A. — allow students to pursue multiple graduate degrees in different disciplines, encouraging interdisciplinary thought that our world needs more of. Requiring just one test, the GRE, for a J.D./M.A. candidate would streamline the admissions process and make it easier for dual-degree applicants to apply, as well as encourage more students to consider dual degrees.
The GRE still requires rigorous research to determine its effectiveness as a benchmark for prospective law students. But there is a lot of promise. So who knows, maybe by the time I graduate law school — praying I get there — aspiring lawyers won’t be stressing over difficult logic games in preparation for the LSAT. We’ll have to wait and see.

Sonali Seth stated this in her article:  “. . . a professor at Stanford Law School, called law “the least diverse profession in the nation.” Not sure if that is correct, but if so, how does that correlate with the LSAT? Does the LSAT have some secret, special characteristic that minorities cannot figure out, yet somehow whites can? So the whites do much better than minorities? Please explain.

Dear Hecuba,
My first semester is almost done and I feel like I don’t fit in at USC. I didn’t get into the club I wanted to join and I didn’t rush, so I’m going to have to wait until next year to find out if I even get into a sorority that I like. My roommate is nice to me, but she has other friends and I feel bad about tagging along all the time. When I was in high school, USC was my dream school, but now I’m not sure if I fit in with the Trojan Family. On the other hand, who knows if I’ll have more luck picking my next school and it’ll be even harder to make friends there.
 
–Friendless in Fluor Tower
 
Dear Thinking,
 
I’m glad you wrote to me and I’ve been thinking about how to answer this for a long time. I want you to know that you’re not alone. Transferring won’t be the end of the world: 4 percent of students at USC leave after their first year and the national average of students who leave their college after their first year is 32 percent. It sounds like you did your research before coming here, but many of us have dated somebody who turned out not right for us at all after crushing on them for ages or hated a meal that got great Yelp reviews. 
 
On the other hand (and I understand that you may be aware of these already, but on the off chance you aren’t), might I suggest a few groups on campus? With 19,000 undergraduates enrolled at USC, I would be surprised if there weren’t some like-minded folks you could gel with. Without knowing your interests, here a few that I think you’d be able to get involved with, meet some kind people and, hopefully, find a community: I Am That Girl USC, KXSC Radio, MUSE at USC, USC Harman Academy, Peaks and Professors, The Slam Scene and USC Special Events Committee (or Program Board’s other committees and assemblies like USC SAGE). There are also many clubs related to specific industries and I’d be happy to point you towards those if you follow up with your major. I also have heard on good authority (specifically a Daily Trojan writer who is a close friend of mine) that it took her and many of her friends until junior year to “find their people.”
 
In short, USC is a big school and I do believe that it can and does take longer for many students here to “find their tribe” — especially if they don’t fit any of the common archetypes. A large school like ours allows for greater diversity, too. But lastly, what is right for a lot of people, isn’t right for everyone. I’d recommend keeping both options open: simultaneously applying to transfer to other schools while still seeking out friends and organizations. And know if you transfer or stay, you’ll be in good company either way.
 
Sincerely,
Hecuba

The women’s volleyball team collected two more wins at home last week to improve to 20-7 on the season. The No. 17 Women of Troy surged past No. 15 Utah on Thursday night 3-1 and narrowly edged No. 25 Colorado 3-2 on Saturday. With the two victories, USC moved to 10-1 at home and 12-4 against Pac-12 conference opponents this year, and the team rose to No. 14 in this week’s AVCA Coaches poll. 
The Women of Troy played a five-set thriller against the Buffaloes on Saturday afternoon. USC raced out an early 10-8 lead, but a 7-1 Colorado run shifted the momentum in the first set. The Trojans responded with a 7-2 run of their own to take a slight 18-17 lead. But crucial attack errors allowed the Buffaloes to break off another 7-0 run to seize a 24-18 advantage, and they eventually claimed the first set 25-20.
The Trojans rebounded in the second frame, leading by as much as 9 points to tie things up with a 25-17 win. The third set was an extremely close battle, as neither team could gain a distinct advantage with several tied scores and short-lived leads. USC tied it late at 24 and took brief 1-point leads, but the Buffaloes never gave up, knotting the set up at 26-26 and later 27-27. Eventually, a kill by Abu Naghede and a USC attack error gave the Buffaloes a 29-27 third-set win.
The Buffaloes took an early 3-2 lead in the fourth, but the Trojans responded with a devastating 18-3 run to take a 20-3 lead, and they surged to a 25-11 win to tie the match 2-2. Despite trailing 8-6 early on in the final frame, the Women of Troy rallied back with a 9-3 run to clinch the match with a 15-11 fifth-set victory.
The Women of Troy were led by sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who recorded a double-double with 21 kills and 14 digs on a .333 hitting percentage. Freshman opposite hitter Brooke Botkin chipped in 14 kills on .290 hitting percentage, and senior opposite hitters Niki Withers and Brittany Abercrombie combined for 21 kills. The team collectively had a .257 hitting percentage and 60 total kills in the win, while senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina fueled the attack with 23 assists each.
Battling Utah on Thursday night, the Trojans quickly took advantage, establishing a 13-8 lead in the opening minutes. After the Utes stormed back to tie it at 18, USC used a 7-3 run to take the first set 25-21 behind successful kills from Abercrombie, Withers and Lanier. The second set remained close as the two squads battled to a 9-9 stalemate early on, but the Trojans built a 3-point lead and never looked back, taking the set 25-17.
Utah rode an 8-1 run in the middle of the third frame to win 25-18 and cut into USC’s lead. The fourth set was a close battle as both teams exchanged leads early on, but the Trojans used a critical 5-0 run to take a 11-7 lead behind three kills in four plays from Botkin. While the Utes kept close with the Trojans throughout the rest of the set, USC eventually took the set and match with a 25-22 victory.
Lanier once again led the Trojans with 17 kills on a .304 hitting percentage while Abercrombie collected 16 kills. Withers and Botkin combined for 21 kills in the win, while
Meyer-Whalley recorded a double-double with 32 assists and 12 digs. Marina added an additional 15 assists. USC recorded 10 blocks, led by senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn’s seven block assists. 
The Women of Troy only have four matches left in the regular season, as they wrap up against Stanford, Cal, Oregon and UCLA in the coming weeks. After the wins against Colorado and Utah, USC hits the road for three consecutive tilts. The team will return to the Galen Center to face UCLA on Nov. 25 for its regular-season finale.

On Monday night against North Dakota State, USC experienced no spillover effects from their triumph over Cal State Fullerton in Friday night’s home opener. Monday, in front of a
half-filled Galen Center, the men’s basketball team sputtered out of the gate against a NDSU squad that lost its season opener to UC Santa Barbara on Saturday and escaped with a 75-65 win. 
Although the Trojans (2-0) played markedly better in the second half, it could not separate from the Bison (0-2) until the final minutes. Two late runs finally propelled the Trojans to a nail-biting win, but this was not the game anyone expected to see less than a week until they travel to Nashville to take on Vanderbilt.
At one point in the first half, down double-digits, junior forward Chimezie Metu had to reenter the game with two fouls after sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic rolled his ankle and left for the locker game. Head coach Andy Enfield said after the game that Rakocevic will be out for a few days.
“Nick getting hurt in one minute and Chimezie getting two fouls [meant] we had to get out of our rotation,” Enfield said. 
Enfield’s decision to bring back Metu paid dividends, as the forward immediately scored a lefty hook in the lane, which sparked a 12-2 run to tie the game 33-33 at the half. 
Like Friday night, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin beat the buzzer to cap the run, this time with a reverse layup assisted by senior guard Elijah Stewart off a Bison turnover with five seconds to play. 
The Trojans started the second half with conviction: Metu slammed two dunks in three minutes, including a rim-rattling alley-oop from junior forward Bennie Boatwright. Later he swatted away a dunk attempt and then add a third of his own. However, NDSU matched the energy tit for tat, and Enfield called a timeout after NDSU sophomore Deng Geu scored a pair of dunks to give his team a 56-51 lead with 9:28 remaining.
During that timeout, Enfield switched to a zone defense.
“They were spreading the floor with their shooters, so we decided to play zone for the last 10 minutes of the game,” Enfield said. 
After USC switched to zone, NDSU scored only 9 points and one 3-pointer. The perimeter was locked down, but the game was still close.
Until then, NDSU had stayed in the game with its motion offense which brought a barrage of 3-pointers, 10 in total. The Bison returned a corps of four players who shot 40 percent from deep a season ago, but on Monday, redshirt freshman Cameron Hunter led the attack. Hunter, the son of legendary Kansas guard Cedric Hunter, had 24 points, going 8-of-11 from the floor. 
Only when Geu, NDSU’s most athletic forward, fouled out with 5:15 to play, did the Trojans take control of the game, eventually going on a 10-0 run to grab a 70-60 fatal lead.
Leading the Trojans on Monday was Boatwright, who finished with a career-high 28 points. He shot 10-of-17 from the floor and 7-of-10 from the free throw line. Thirteen of his shot attempts were from the key.  Boatwright, who made only one 3-pointer out of four attempts, was shocked he scored a career-high with such a stat line. After all, he was primarily a 3-point shooter his freshman year.
“Two years ago, I wouldn’t have believed this,” he said of his night. 
Enfield added that Boatwright was in much better shape than he was as a freshman.
“He is able to put the ball on the floor, post-up and make plays for his teammates,” Enfield said. 
Aside from Boatwright, USC shot 10-of-21 from the free throw line, 17-of-43 from the field, and 3-of-12 from beyond the arc. 
“It was just one of those nights,” McLaughlin said. “We just got to get in the gym and practice shooting.”
Nice write up Jonathan!

The second-ranked men’s water polo team battled it out with No. 4 UCLA through three overtime periods on Saturday. The match in Westwood came down to a penalty shot awarded to UCLA, as the Bruins had the chance to earn the victory in a one-on-one showdown against senior goalie McQuin Baron. Alex Roelse’s skip-shot just sneaked past Baron’s right shoulder, and UCLA clinched a 12-11 victory. 
A match that ended in heartbreak started out much differently for the Trojans. USC asserted its dominance early, as freshman driver Marko Vavic sent a shot soaring into the back of the goal in the opening minutes of play. Senior utility James Walters followed up with another goal, staking the Trojans an early 2-0 lead.
But the Bruins responded quickly. Following the first 2 USC goals, they quickly tied it up before the Trojans could extend their lead. The rest of the second period was a back-and-forth affair, but USC never trailed and eventually managed to take a 5-4 lead into halftime thanks to additional scores from senior driver Lazar Pasuljevic, junior driver Zach D’Sa and senior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards.
Coming out of the locker room, senior driver Matteo Morelli sent one sailing past UCLA goalie Alex Wolf on USC’s first possession, padding USC’s advantage to 6-4. However, the Bruins scored 3 unanswered goals — 2 on the power play — to seize a 7-6 lead. The Trojans responded with 2 goals in the final minute of the third quarter before the Bruins converted another man-up opportunity to knot things at 8 goals apiece heading into the final quarter.
The scoring slowed down in the fourth: Senior driver Blake Edwards capitalized on a power play to give USC the edge, but UCLA did the same to reestablish the deadlock. In the final three minutes of play, neither team could pull ahead, forcing overtime with the two sides tied at 9-9.
After a long scoreless stretch from both teams, Blake Edwards sent a shot flying past Wolf’s outstretched left arm to give the Trojans a late lead in the first overtime period. But USC’s hopes lasted just nine seconds, as the Bruins responded with their own goal. It was 10-10.
The Bruins’ reply forced the match into a second overtime, and this time, it was UCLA that scored first. Lachlan Edwards saved the Trojans with a backhanded shot that sailed past Wolf’s fingertips to tie things back up at 11-11 with only 38 seconds left.
The match moved into sudden death in the third overtime period. After only a few minutes of play, the Bruins were awarded the decisive penalty shot that sent the Trojans home with a tough 12-11 loss.
Despite a disappointing end to the regular season, the Trojans now look forward to the postseason. USC begins play in the MPSF Tournament as the No. 4 seed, and the team will kick off against Penn State Behrend at 10 a.m. on Friday before facing No. 3 Stanford at 3 p.m.

Angel Viscarra | Daily Trojan
It’s hard to fathom, but we now find ourselves at the conclusion of Week 10 of the NFL regular season. The first 10 Sundays have confirmed several preseason hunches, and some clubs have shown up to the party as pleasant surprises. 
It may have been a bumpy start, but the New England Patriots (7-2) are looking like the juggernaut everyone projected them to be at the season’s start. The Cleveland Browns, well, they’ve looked like the Cleveland Browns at 0-9 on the season. 
The Philadelphia Eagles, led by second-year quarterback Carson Wentz, have jumped out as the top team in the NFC with the best record in the NFL to this point (8-1). A team like the Jacksonville Jaguars, powered by rookie running back sensation Leonard Fournette, is sitting at 6-3 after a 3-13 campaign in 2016. 
But one of the league’s biggest surprises this season has emerged from the NFC West: the 7-2, division-leading Los Angeles Rams. After finishing 2016 at 4-12 overall, losing 10 of its final 11 games, Los Angeles now finds itself with a one-game lead on Seattle (6-3) in the NFC West. If the regular season ended today, the Rams would hold the No. 4 seed in the NFC playoffs. 
After the Rams lost a close divisional contest to Seattle last month, I wrote that if Los Angeles played its cards right, it could be a fringe playoff team come season’s end. Oh, how things have escalated. The football world no longer is asking, “Will the Rams steal a playoff spot?” It is now asking the biggest of questions: “Could this Rams team win the Super Bowl?” 
Entering the season, the Rams had the 18th-best chance of winning the Super Bowl (150 to 1 odds). After the Rams’ 33-7 victory over Houston on Sunday, Los Angeles now holds the fourth-highest chance of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy (11 to 1), according to Bovada. 
Defensive end Aaron Donald has been a key cog for the Rams so far with five sacks, three forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. Photo from Wikimedia Commons,
The Rams’ 7-2 start has been sparked by arguably the most-balanced offense-defense combo in the NFL. The Rams’ offense, with a blooming young quarterback in Jared Goff (16 passing touchdowns this season), leads the NFL in scoring with 32.9 points per game. On the defensive side, the Rams have allowed the fourth-fewest points in all of football (18 points per game). 
Up to this point in the season, it seems that 31-year-old head coach Sean McVay has pushed all the right buttons. McVay, who was the youngest head coaching hire in NFL history this past offseason, has resurrected a franchise that seemed to be going nowhere. 
But what awaits this Rams team is a gantlet of a final stretch to conclude the regular season. In the next seven weeks of play, McVay’s Rams’ hot start will either go up in smoke, or Los Angeles will solidify itself as the strong playoff contender Las Vegas projects it to be. 
It should be noted that the Rams will conclude regular season play with what currently appears to be a pushover of a Week 17 contest with the San Francisco 49ers (1-9). However, the Rams’ next six opponents have a combined win-loss record of 38-15 so far this season. 
Los Angeles will square off with a pair of 7-2 teams in the next two weeks. The Rams will go on the road to play the NFC North-leading Minnesota Vikings in Week 11, and in Week 12, they host the NFC South-leading New Orleans Saints (currently 7-2). 
Add to that a crucial divisional road game against the Seahawks in Week 15, and it’s apparent that the Rams will undergo a baptism by fire in the coming weeks as they take on some of the hottest teams in the league. 
But should the Rams escape from November and go through December with a winning record, there is certainly a playoff spot waiting for them on the other side of the trial. If Los Angeles can scrap up some statement wins over the final seven weeks of the season, it would solidify itself as a scary matchup for anyone come playoff time. 
Winning seven of nine games to open the season put the Rams on the radars of relevance across the NFL. A strong finish through the gantlet of teams that await could certainly warrant them a credible position on the NFL’s Super Bowl radar.

The Neural Plasticity and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory is in the process of creating ways for people to go through brain rehabilitation with virtual reality technology. Photo courtesy of VRSC.
The Neural Plasticity and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory at USC is exploring the intersection of virtual reality and neuroscience with a new program that aims to help stroke victims. 
The laboratory aims to implement VR technology in health care under the acronym REINVENT, according to Sook-Lei Liew, head of the NPNL. 
Liew’s laboratory is partnering with USC Institute of Creative Technologies’ MxR lab for the REINVENT project, which focuses on virtual reality and stroke rehabilitation.
“In all areas of human interaction with any kind of sophisticated technology, you want to develop things can amplify human functioning and learning,” said Albert Rizzo, who works at the MxR lab.
The MxR lab is  part of USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies and hosts a variety of research at the forefront of virtual development, with focuses on optical physical therapy and game apps.
Rizzo explained that in using VR as a medium for rehabilitation or as a tool for data collection, there are three measurements that must be considered.
“First is the patient’s self-report — what do they think of the treatment and how do they think they are responding [for example],” Rizzo said. “Next is behavior, which is the measurement of the patient’s interactions before and after the treatment. Lastly, we can analyze body signals such as heart rate, electroencephalogram patterns or measurements of internal states.”
Oftentimes, the treatment required for stroke recovery is tedious and frustrating for patients, Rizzo said. Since improvement is infrequent and made in small increments, the ability to distract the patient during rehabilitation and show them data afterward is advantageous.
“The best tool VR currently provides us with is an environment in which we can control the stimulus,” Rizzo said. “We see how placing a patient in a game-like environment focuses their attention and allows us to motivate the patient with quantifiable results.”
Liew aimed to detect when the patient thinks about moving their hand and create the illusion that they actually are, Rizzo explained. 
At the time of publication, Liew was traveling and was not available for comment.
The application of VR to current technologies is as important as understanding the approach of those methods for stroke patients, according to Julia Anglin, a research lab supervisor at NPNL who works closely with Liew. 
“While stroke survivors suffered damage to the brain, there is still activity in the motor cortex,” Anglin said. “We’re interested in building the connection back between the brain and the muscles.”
The REINVENT project aims to replace a stroke survivor’s arm with a virtual one, so that the brain sends signals to the muscles it rebuilds. In the process, the role of VR is to give the embodiment aspect imitating the feeling and feedback from one’s own arm.
Anglin has conducted her own VR research in the past and found differences in the learning mechanisms participants used when conducting a motor function normally as opposed to with virtual reality.
When using advanced screening tools, Anglin said researchers can study the brain and create more dynamic stimuli using VR. 
“These stimuli tell us more about what the brain is doing, and can help us determine what parts of VR are most important during decision-making or interactive processes like stroke rehabilitation,” said David Krum, a computer scientist at the Institute for Creative Technologies.
Rizzo, Anglin and Krum all agree that VR has a bright future, as exploration of VR’s practical features has only become a focus in the past few years.
As far as REINVENT goes, Anglin explained that they are just starting to measure the efficacy of VR among stroke survivors. While the data hasn’t fully been analyzed yet, she believes the program will continue for a long time. REINVENT is in the process of obtaining new grants.   
“Our first grant was based on creating a device that was practical and affordable, and we developed the hardware using open software in collaboration with the ICT,” Anglin said. “So, we suspect this is going to be a long haul.”
Krum said that some of the same problems and applications seen in VR today are similar to what the researchers have been working on in the past, in fields like medicine or social communication. 
The challenge lies in generating VR content and knowing what goes into developing it, Krum said.

Students, faculty members and fans of actress and writer Issa Rae flooded Wallis Annenberg Hall Monday night to see her speak for the USC Annenberg-HBO Diverse Voices Forum series.
Rae, known for her role in the HBO comedy-drama Insecure, spoke about her start in the film industry, which began during her undergraduate years at Stanford University. There, she wrote and directed several plays, but her film career specifically started in the digital realm. She created the pilot of the mockumentary series, Dorm Diaries for a class project, which highlighted what it means to be a black student at Stanford. 
“Being black, being in these experiences where you are constantly going back and forth and code-switching between environments, it becomes second nature for a writer to want to tap into their own stories,” Rae said. “I’m no expert on all stories of black people, but all I can do is represent myself and my truth.”
Rae also produced and starred in critically acclaimed comedy web-series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl in 2011, which received recognition from publications like The New York Times and television production company Shondaland. 
After it ended, Rae said HBO reached out to her for a television series, to which Rae pitched in the concept that later developed into the premise of Insecure.
For Rae, one of her main priorities as a producer is fixing the disconnect that lies between the reality of demographics and the representation of these demographics on screen. Through Insecure, Rae made an effort to portray black people and South Central Los Angeles realistically.
“I didn’t see any black people on TV I knew personally since the ’90s,” Rae said. “I couldn’t identify with them, and that was important to me. I didn’t want caricatures or stereotypes. I wanted to see characters people could connect with.
When Director of the Institute of Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg Taj Frazier, who moderated the event, referred to Rae as a “face of the new wave of multiculturalism” and asked her about resolving the lack of diversity in the film industry, Rae said that doing so has always been a mission of hers, even though she has yet to discover how to use her platform for that benefit. 
However, Rae believes that working with the people around her regardless of race and background ultimately helped her achieve her success.
“Much of the industry is working with who you’re comfortable with,” Rae said. “[But] it is so important to consider the people right next to you. They can be strong in the areas you are weak, and that can make all the difference.”
Ellice Ellis, a sophomore majoring in journalism who attended the event, said she admired Rae for her honesty when it came to her responses to the diversity gap in the film industry.
“She is in such a weird place right now, since she is famous but some of her influence could be a lot smaller than we think,” Ellis said. “These kinds of actors were all just like, ‘Hey, I looked at the people around me and worked with them, and that’s what brought me to where I am now.’”
Following Rae’s talk with Frazier, the conversation opened up to questions from the audience, including some about her college experiences and others about racial representation on screen.
Monica Scott, a junior majoring in architecture, who said she has followed Rae ever since the inception of Dorm Diaries, said she found it comforting that she and Rae share a lot of the same progressive views and opinions as black women.
“I feel like she is doing something where our interests aren’t necessarily aligned,” she said. “I’m doing architecture, and she’s in the visual arts — but they are very similar in that she is a black millennial woman that is out there doing her own thing,
