USC traveled up north for its final two meetings against Oregon and Oregon State last weekend. The Trojans came out of the trip losing back-to-back games — an overtime loss Friday to the Beavers, then a blowout defeat to the Ducks.
Against Oregon State, USC started off strong, shooting 58.8% in the first quarter. However, that number dipped to 26.7% in the next 10 minutes to end the half ahead at 30-24. 
Even though the Trojans were winning the shooting battle at halftime — shooting 43.8% compared to Beavers’ 30.3% — Oregon State still had 8 more rebounds, 24-16. USC had a 10-point lead late in the third quarter. 
The Beavers fought back with 17 points from freshman guard Talia von Oelhoffen in the fourth quarter. Von Oelhoffen finished with 31 points in the game. To end regulation, Oregon State was on a 7-0 run with help from von Oelhoffen’s fifth 3-pointer.
In overtime, the game continued to be close to the final seconds. With 1:26 left in the game, freshman center Clarice Akunwafo got the Trojans back to level terms at 61-61. However, the next score ended up costing USC as the Beavers got a down low buzzer beater to win 63-61. 
Despite the loss, many Trojans showed strong performances. Sophomore forward Jordyn Jenkins and freshman guard Rayah Marshall both earned double-doubles on the night. Marshall ended the night with 17 points, 12 rebounds and 5 blocks in 29 minutes, while Jenkins had 12 points and 14 rebounds in 43 minutes. 
Junior guard Alyson Miura had 2 3-pointers for 10 points in the game and a career-high 4 steals. In the end, USC finished the game shooting 36.6% from the field and 22.2% from three. 
After losing the tight game against the Beavers Friday, the Trojans continued their away trip by squaring against No. 19 Oregon. 
This game was not as close, as the Ducks started off strong and left USC behind in the first quarter. In a low-scoring performance, shooting 29.6% compared to Oregon’s 53.1%, the Trojans were down 17 by the half, 38-21. 
The poor shooting continued throughout the afternoon, as USC finished shooting 26.3% from the field and 23.5% from three. Additionally, the 17 turnovers compared to the Ducks 10 were costly in the blowout loss. 
A lone bright spot was Jenkins and Marshall who each played another double-digit performance with 16 and 11 points in the game, respectively. Graduate student forward Jordan Sanders added 11 points. Marshall also grabbed 9 rebounds in her performance.
In both games, USC missed junior forward Alissa Pili and graduate student guard Tera Reed. With these two losses on the road, the Trojans are now with a 9-9 overall record for the season and 2-6 in Pac-12conference play. 
USC will return home to host UC Berkeley Friday and Stanford Feb. 6.

This review contains spoilers for the first two episodes of “Pam & Tommy.”
In 1995, Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee had their sex tape stolen out of a safe in their home. In 2022, Hulu — for some unknown reason — decided to create a show highlighting the sex tape’s thief. 
Hulu’s newest original, “Pam & Tommy,” premieres Feb. 2 and follows Pamela Anderson (Lily James) and Tommy Lee (Sebastian Stan) as they fall in love, get married and have their sex tape stolen and leaked. 
The first episode introduces audiences to Rand Gauthier (Seth Rogan), Lee’s electrician, who Lee reportedly fired for subpar work and subsequently failed to pay $20,000. Gauthier is immediately cast as the sympathetic exploited worker manipulated by a rockstar. 
Gauthier is understandably fed up with Lee and feels taken advantage of. He then decides to take revenge on Lee by robbing his house. At the end of the second episode, Gauthier steals a safe from Lee’s house, takes it into the woods to crack open and finds Lee and Anderson’s sex tape. With the help of Uncle Miltie (Nick Offerman), Gauthier decides to sell the video. 
It becomes apparent immediately that “Pam & Tommy” chose to focus not on the victims, but the perpetrators of one of the biggest ‘90s sex scandals. 
With recreations of ‘90s drama gracing television screens recently, such as “Impeachment: American Crime Story” and “The Crown,” it seemed inevitable that the infamous scandal would soon reach our screens. However, unlike in “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” which included Lewinsky as a producer to ensure accuracy and do her story justice, Hulu did not offer that same courtesy to Anderson. 
“Pam & Tommy,” after all, is Gauthier’s story, not Anderson’s. 
If the show was meant to truthfully portray Anderson’s story, showrunners would have consulted her. The showrunners attempt to craft Gauthier as a sympathetic victim of the vicious Lee. Unsurprisingly, this attempt fails, in part because of Rogan’s awful acting. Rogan is hilarious when he plays himself, but because the role of Gauthier forces him to show a tiny bit of genuine emotion and not just a funny character while high, he is awful.
The first episode attempts to force you to understand Gauthier’s motives for robbing Lee’s house, but honestly, who cares? Who cares about Lee bullying Gauthier and thus Gauthiers justification for releasing someone’s most intimate moments onto the internet without their consent? 
It does not matter what happened to Gauthier — revenge porn is never justifiable. It’s 2022. We don’t need to know about the sex tape distributors, and Gauthier’s story certainly did not deserve its TV show. 
It is awful that an appalling script so intensely mars a well-created show, especially in its other aspects. “Pam & Tommy” manages to recreate the feeling of ‘90s Los Angeles through its color scheme, filming techniques and set design. It is an excellent look into the glamor and intense sexism of the ‘90s.
The acting and work done to recreate Anderson and Lee are both outstanding. James perfectly embodies Anderson, a woman attempting to be more than the sex symbol the world has made her, and Stan is a complete and utter asshole, just like Lee. 
James looks nothing like herself and nothing like she did in “Cinderella” or “Mamma Mia.” She completely embodies Anderson, from her voice to her mannerisms. Additionally, the prosthetic work on the show is incredible. There was an astronomical amount of fake tan and prosthetics applied to James, but thank goodness for that decision — she looks like ‘90s Pamela Anderson at the peak of her career. 
Similarly, the amount of work done on Stan’s body to look like Lee’s is shocking. Fake tattoos and piercings cover his body, making him a far cry from the Winter Soldier — his most well-known character. Stan’s ability to make you hate Lee is outstanding. By the end of the first episode, you want to punch Lee in the face just as much as Gauthier does. 
James and Stan are the stars of this show, but they are not in the limelight, at least in the first two episodes. They deserve more screentime because the pair perfectly depicts one of the wildest love stories of the ‘90s: the original Britney and K-Fed. 
However, no amount of incredible acting by James or Stan can cover up the glaring issues with the show. “Pam & Tommy” tells a story that did not need to be told.

A team of six masters students at the Roski School of Art and Design curated an exhibit called “Unending Beginnings,” which features works from artists exploring the connections between materialism, survivalism and colonialism. 
Emma Christ, Nahui Garcia, Lauren Guilford, Leah Perez, Austen Villacis and Ruei-Chen Tsai created the gallery as part of their masters of art in curatorial practices and the public sphere degree program. The exhibit will run until Feb. 11 at the USC Roski Graduate Gallery in the Los Angeles Arts Districts and will remain open Monday through Friday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
The idea for the gallery originated in the spring of their first year, when the students started talking about curating the exhibit. During that time they also shared texts and authors of interest who spotlight Indigenous communities through the gallery, Garcia said.
“The title of our show is ‘Unending Beginnings’ because it’s rooted in the idea that the apocalypse has already occurred to indigenous people,” she said.
Each curator originally suggested three to five artists to feature in the gallery. Curators held studio meetings with each artist to determine which of their works would serve best for the show. 
The six artists involved in the exhibit each use unique mediums to address different aspects of dismantling the ways in which capitalism and colonialism intrinsically tie into ecological destruction, according to the exhibit’s press release. 
Featured artist Eddie Rodalfo Aparicio uses materials associated with pre-Hispanic culture and covers political and racial tensions that exist between Los Angeles and El Salvador, while Pia Camil explores Mexico’s urban landscape and consumerism through sculpture, painting, film and performance.
Assistant professor of ethnic studies Gerald Clarke Jr., whose artwork also takes part in the exhibit, draws from his cultural heritage to explore his community’s struggles through art. 
Other artists at the exhibit, such as Colleen Hargaden used time-based media to traverse “ecology, futurity, and technology,” while Cécile B. Evans works with video and installations to investigate emotional connections with the physical and technological world. Angel Lartigue, whose artwork is research-based, uses a process called “putrefaction” to understand the relationship between body and land. 
Despite presenting vastly different artwork, connections between the artists and their work allow for strong themes and ideas within the gallery, said Christ.
“You can see this sort of visual flow,” Christ said. “When you read the didactics, the wall materials as well as the forthcoming essays, there’s a lot of underlying thematic ideas of things like mutability, malleability, materiality, that are prevalent throughout them.”
The gallery will also host a workshop with anthropologist Claudia Serrato, who is very interested in food, Guillford said. 
Serrato is “really interested in how you can tell stories … and history thorugh food. … not like making a meal and eating together. It’s more about the materiality, and the history.” According to Christ, the gallery focus on “ways of exploring or engaging with alternative histories, futures and presents, and I think that that food is really representative of being a medium or a vessel [for] retelling narratives and retelling experiences through really tangible aspects”
The curators hope visitors will not only enjoy the artists’ works but also learn about new cultures and histories while visiting the gallery.
“Pia Camil talks about Indigenous people from southern Mexico, so we want [viewers] to maybe, by reading the description or looking her up … find more information about those communities,” Garcia said.
The gallery also creates room for viewers to both learn and reflect for themselves, said Guilford. 
“There are so many layers to each work and they all approach materiality in a different way, and they’re all very layered with different histories and ecologies, and these things are all kind of converging in each work,” Guilford said. “What I want people to take away from the show is just thinking about how they interact with the world and systems.”

Families scurried into the Uytengsu Aquatic Center Saturday to watch No. 1 women’s water polo’s season-opening doubleheader, many of whom came to support the 10 new freshmen. Parents engaged in friendly small talk: younger siblings ran around the bleachers and babies screamed insufferably. 
And while the inklings of a tight-knit community in the stands began to form, another classic family scene was taking place down at the pool — a younger brother who finally convinced his older one to play with him. The young, impressionable child is excited, until the playing starts. While the younger child is giving everything he has, the older brother wins effortlessly.
That’s more or less what USC’s doubleheader looked like against Claremont-Mudd Scripps and Occidental. The Trojans put the former to bed, 31-4, and against the latter, they won 33-2. 
“Even though the wins were convincing, there’s some patterns that you can see: player anticipation and communication.” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric. “We will try to pick it up and design the rotations for the next tournament.”
Still, it was a dominant display from USC. Redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns, who spent last summer in Tokyo trying to win Australia an Olympic medal, scored 10 goals across both games. The Trojans also saw scores from 15 other players on Saturday.
“We’ve been trying a lot of rotations and a lot of possibilities,” Pintaric said. “Overall, I’m happy with the way they performed, the way the energy was.”
Many of the goals came from breakaways or easy 2-on-1 situations, but as the score differential ballooned, USC would often pull the ball back out, wait for its opponent to catch up and attack against a set defense.
“The whole idea is really to focus on the fast break balance and the fast break offense. [We] try to recognize what they do on defense and then attack accordingly,” Pintaric said.
After goalie Holly Parker, who was eighth in saves in USC history, graduated last year, junior Carolyne Stern and redshirt junior Erin Tharp split time in the cage. Stern saved 7 shots against Claremont-Mudd Scripps, and Tharp parried 4 of Occidental’s attempts. Pintaric is undecided on a definitive starter and will continue testing the two over the course of the next few weeks.
“Carolyne is listed as our starter right now,” Pintaric said. “But it’s always a competition, especially in this position, and that competition brings the best out of them.”
USC jumps back into their home pool, against Fresno State Friday at 5:00 p.m.

After a packed December and first few weeks of January, European soccer enjoyed a quiet weekend while taking an international break — except, no European countries are actually playing international fixtures. While the African Cup of Nations and World Cup Qualifiers took place on other continents, many players from European national teams the opportunity to take a break — a rare occurrence in a sport where pro matches play around the globe 12 months a year.
As such, it’s a good time to sit back and reflect on the state of the various title races around Europe’s top leagues. In some leagues, one team has already run away with it (cough, cough, Paris Saint-Germain), but there’s still intrigue to be found elsewhere. Here, I’ve ranked some of the top leagues’ title races (sorry not sorry, Ligue 1) in order of competitiveness.
5. English Premier League
If you’ve paid close attention to the Premier League recently, you’d probably say the title race is over and that Manchester City has won. Most pundits already have. However, the latest round of fixtures offered neutrals — and Liverpool fans — a glimmer of hope that we might still see a title race. For the first time since Oct. 30, Man City failed to win a Premier League match, drawing with Southampton 1-1, while Liverpool topped Crystal Palace 3-1. As it stands, Liverpool sits 9 points behind Man City with a game in hand, so the gap could shrink to 6 points with equal matches played. 
Given Man City’s form, a 6-point swing seems fairly unlikely but not impossible. Liverpool’s attack has actually outscored Man City’s this season by 58 goals to 55, so if the Merseyside club improves their defense marginally for the remainder of the season, they stand a chance of matching Man City’s results. However, Man City would have to falter. Given the team’s current form, squad depth and quality in the pitch, losing two more matches seems unlikely with the weakness of their remaining schedule. If Liverpool tightens the gap, be sure to tune in when these title rivals clash April 9.
4. Bundesliga
No club currently dominates its domestic league like Bayern Munich does the Bundesliga. They’ve won the past nine league titles in a row, most of which haven’t been close contests, and, to further solidify their dominance, they’ve made a habit of signing their rivals’ best players. Most of their current stars — Robert Lewandoski, Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich — signed from within the Bundesliga.
 Bayern has a commanding 6-point lead and haven’t looked like they’re relinquishing it so far, but Borussia Dortmund, Bayern’s most credible competitor in recent seasons, have displayed some strong form recently and are best poised to trouble the incumbent champions. Superstar striker Erling Haaland spearheads Dortmund’s attack, putting up 16 goals in just 14 appearances. Haaland will likely transfer over the summer, so Dortmund finds itself in somewhat of a do-or-die moment, as whatever attacker the club brings in to replace the Norwegian surely won’t produce at the same level.
3. Eredivisie
The casual fan may find the Eredivisie’s inclusion here surprising, but Ajax and PSV Eindhoven will likely go down to the wire in their fight for the Dutch top league. Ajax has already won the season series against PSV, winning 5-0 at home in October and 2-1 in the recent away fixture to go top by 2 points. Ajax have posted incredible numbers in both attack and defense, scoring 61 goals and conceding only 5 over 20 matches. 
Manager Erik ten Hag has drilled his side thoroughly with their dominating style. Ajax have averaged 66.8% possession per match — no other Dutch side posts over 60%. PSV, on the other hand, have proved that, ultimately, results matter just as much as style. The Eindhoven club doesn’t score 3 goals per match like Ajax, but they’ve matched them almost step for step. Ajax’s 2 point lead can dissipate in a single match day, so they can’t afford to rest on their laurels. 
2. La Liga
Typically, Spain’s title races come down to a clash between two of soccer’s greatest rivals — Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, with the occasional Atlético Madrid title to mix things up.
 Real Madrid once again find themselves in pole position, but only with a tenuous 4-point lead over surprise title challengers Sevilla. Sevilla built up a reputation of solidity and competence over the last decade, but rarely presented themselves as legitimate title challengers. Advanced stats say that both Real Madrid and Sevilla have over-performed, meaning they should have both conceded more goals and scored fewer based on the quality of shots they give up and create. 
If they both regress to the mean, the two sides may face some hiccups in the late stages, leaving the title hanging in the balance until the final match days. 
1. Serie A
While La Liga has the closest title race in numerical terms, Juventus’s downfall over the last couple seasons has created a void for supremacy in Italy where multiple teams are left fighting to assume dominance. Inter Milan are the current kings of the hill, having won last year’s title and sitting top again in January, currently by 4 points. Napoli and AC Milan have both earned 49 points to date, having played one more game than Inter, who could extend their lead to 7 points if they win their game in hand.
 Yet, Italian soccer has embraced chaos in recent seasons, eschewing their former reputation of defensive, rigid soccer and adopting more fluid, pressing-heavy schemes — evinced by Inter scoring a blistering 2.44 goals per game. 
Manager Simone Inzaghi has Inter Milan purring at the moment, even after losing Romelu Lukaku in the summer, but things could change quickly at the top. Milan, Napoli and even Atalanta and Juventus have the firepower to catch a hot streak and surge forward. If Inter or another side secure the title earlier than expected, the race for Champions League qualification spots will surely be hotly contested.

An enthusiastic crowd bustled into the Norris Cinema Theatre Friday night for an exclusive screening of Walt Disney Animation Studios’ latest film, “Encanto.” A Q&A session followed with director and writer Jared Bush, producer Yvett Merino, production office manager and USC alumnus Babatunde Akinloye and the Walt Disney Animation Studios President Clark Spencer.
After the film’s conclusion, Lau Rodriguez, a junior majoring in film and television production, asked the audience who already viewed the film and nearly everyone’s hand went up as the crowd exploded in cheers and applause. 
During the Q&A, panelists discussed their inspiration, the storyline, character development, songwriting process, team dynamics and research conducted for the film. 
Bush kicked off the conversation, speaking about the initial spark that launched the film’s writing and production.  
“We started a little over five years ago, and it really starts with a nugget of an idea. What do you want to say? What matters to you? What story are you compelled to tell?” Bush said. “Your job as a writer and director is to shepherd that idea through all those years and bring on as many brilliant people as possible to help you find something to bring their own ideas to the mix.”
Initially, the team was not sure which Latin American country they wanted to focus on, but after talking with friends and fellow filmmakers Natalia Osma and Juan Rendon, they settled on Colombia. Following this decision, they researched extensively, traveling to Colombia for two weeks to jumpstart the process. 
The team created much of the film from home during the pandemic, and the speakers shared their thoughts on the unique experience of working on an animated movie remotely. 
“We literally made every single frame you saw on the screen, from home, from 800 separate homes,” Spencer said. “To see all of these artists and all these technicians come together and put their passion and their heart and their soul in the middle of a pandemic to create this film because they believed in it so deeply, and then to see what ultimately got created and see it on a big screen … that was really a phenomenal part and something that definitely separates it from anything else I’ve worked on.” 
Akinloye, a 2018 graduate of USC Master of Fine Arts program in film and television production, specifically touched on the attention to detail when representing AfroLatinx characters in the film.
“The filmmakers met with all the Black employees at Disney Animation, and we were able to shed some light on things like hair texture, skin tones [and] how the fingernail bed of your fingernails differs [from] the complexion on your hand,” Akinloye said. “It was just really deep, and a lot of attention to detail that Black employees were able to speak on.” 
In addition to empowering Black employees at Disney, “Encanto” also opened doors for Latinx employees to take center stage, Merino said.
“In the end, we called it familia, and it really truly was a familia because [Latino employees within the studio] read every script, they saw every screening,” Merino said. “Our familia group was a very important group as part of this process of making this film because really, we got together and shared stories of our experiences growing up — what it meant to grow up in a family where your parents were first generation or second generation.”
Another group that significantly contributed to the film was the Colombian Cultural Trust, which helped the filmmakers understand various aspects of Colombian life and culture.
“We had architects and botanists, and it wasn’t a group that we went to and showed the movie and said, ‘Is this okay?’ This was something that, as the artists were designing, they would meet with the architects and have like two or three hour-long conversations about, ‘What is the architecture in Colombia?’ ‘How were the houses made back then?’ and really get into it, because we have an amazing studio full of artists, and they want to create as much as any artist does, and so they talk to these experts and get inspired by their craft or what they know, and it grows from there,” Merino said. 
The speakers went on to discuss the astounding success of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit song, “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,” the difficulty of working with 12 main animated characters, the family’s home as the film’s primary setting and their favorite characters. 
Rodriguez then opened up the Q&A to the attendees, where audience members inquired about the plot arc of the film, future Disney Animation projects and the technicalities of producing animated features. Some, like Isa Mendez Johnson, a sophomore majoring in journalism, also shared their personal relationship to the characters from “Encanto.” 
“This was the first time I saw someone have my name on screen,” Mendez Johnson said. “I’ve never been able to experience that … I never had a character, and I was finally able to have that, and it made me feel represented, and I really, really appreciate that.”

In 2016, Instagram’s hold on me was irrevocably damaged when it removed its chronological timeline. Instead of the usual orderly assortment, a post from seconds ago would sit above a post three days old. Although a seemingly small, insignificant change, I hated it. This kickstarted my declining desire to be on the app.
However, despite my issues with Instagram, one account stopped me from deleting it completely: Humans of New York. 
According to founder Brandon Stanton, “Humans of New York began as a photography project in 2010. The initial goal was to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers on the street, and create an exhaustive catalogue of the city’s inhabitants.” This morphed into a blog and social media presence that coupled photographs of the person with an interview. People are quoted talking about a variety of themes in their lives, such as loss, addiction, love, family and aspirations. Each person and each story is unique and utterly riveting.
I’ve found that Humans of New York’s evolution as a vehicle for fundraising offers a fascinating case study for nonprofits. Analyzing Humans of New York’s success can help nonprofits learn how to secure funds. 
Humans of New York began to pair philanthropy with stories in 2012, after the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy. Through documenting residents and volunteers impacted by the Hurricane, Stanton raised over $300,000 for hurricane relief. Since then, Humans of New York has raised money in even greater amounts for a variety of causes, including for Rohingya refugees, childhood cancer and education. 
In 2019, Humans of New York profiled a woman named Stephanie Johnson, who told stories of her time as a burlesque dancer, known as Tanqueray, in New York during the 1960s and ’70s. At the time, Johnson had an outpouring of support and love for her story. A year later, Stanton returned to her story with a new 32-part series in an effort to raise money for medical expenses brought on by her failing health. He started a GoFundMe campaign, which raised $2.5 million in a week. The astonishing pace of funding is not an isolated incident; Stanton often creates GoFundMe accounts for people he profiles or partners with nonprofits to raise funds, regularly raising millions of dollars.
The account can attribute part of its success to its active and engaged community. A scroll through Instagram shows the account has 11.6 million followers, with posts consistently receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and thousands of comments. I’ve found stories so compelling I’ve posted them to my Instagram story, sharing them with others. 
But how does Humans of New York attract and maintain such an engaged community? Aside from vibrant and meaningful stories, the account also benefits from its personable presence on social media, the regularity of its posts and speaking engagements. 
Social media often feels impersonal to me; at best, it can be a place to connect with others, but at worst, an impetus for feelings of inadequacy, FOMO and divisiveness. Humans of New York represents the good parts of social media, reminding us of the humanness of those around us and compelling us to act. Similarly, nonprofits can try to incorporate feelings of interconnectedness and remind us of the good of humanity as part of their funding campaigns. 
Pairing any asks for donations with powerful stories moves and motivates people. Additionally, Humans of New York does not ask for donations for every story, which prevents donation fatigue. While nonprofits rely on a regular stream of donations and cannot replicate this strategy exactly, they should understand the effectiveness of a story-driven campaign, rather than simply continually asking for money. 
When stories revolve around difficult experiences, nonprofits must provide a platform for the person to tell their story without a sense of voyeurism or exploitation of the pain or suffering they’ve experienced. This can be a fine line to walk, but allowing a person to tell their story in their own words avoids these pitfalls. 
One fault of Humans of New York is that while it tells incredible stories, it often only raises money for individual people and doesn’t address structural issues. While donations from the Humans of New York community change people’s lives individually, they do not fix underlying issues that put the specific individuals in their situation in the first place. Thus, by utilizing Humans of New York’s techniques, nonprofits can change things in a way Humans of New York does not and cultivate change at both an individual and structural level. 
Counter to its supposed purpose, spending hours on social media usually makes me feel more alone. Humans of New York, on the other hand, lessens my feelings of isolation by giving a face and story to the usual anonymity of billions of people walking the streets. I’ve laughed and cried while browsing the account, sometimes even feeling inspired to donate. Stories are a powerful tool for connection and action. By strengthening the connection between people across the world, nonprofits can increase fundraising success and drive social change.

It’s back, better than ever and completely predictable: The SAT — which apparently stands for Scholastic Aptitude Test — is going digital.
The College Board, the nonprofit organization that administers the SAT, announced the shift would take place in 2024 for American students and even sooner for international students.
Now, before we 20-somethings start sharpening our pitchforks and muttering, “Back in my day,” there are currently no plans for the digital SAT to become an at-home test. Students will still have to rely on their knowledge and memorization, not just a stable Internet connection.
This major update, as with the two preceding, is simply the latest installment of “Does this fix it?” to which the answer is almost unequivocally, “not really.”
High school students have been sweating over the SAT for years, ever since the College Board decided they needed a standardized test that could be used by a wide array of educational establishments, not just well-endowed northeastern private schools.
Since then, the SAT has been a staple of American students’ college applications. Many students begin practicing for the test during their junior year of high school and don’t stop until their score is as close to 1600 as possible. It’s estimated that parents are willing to spend upwards of $2,600 for private instruction to ensure their child gets a shiny, sexy acceptance packet from their dream college in the fall.
The test’s ubiquity has dwindled over the years — much to the delight of high schoolers and wallets everywhere. There are several reasons for this: 1) everybody hates it 2) rich people have an unfair advantage 3) it hails from a deplorable history
First, there’s the question of why everybody — students, faculty, guardians — hates the SAT. Aside from the fact that it’s a two hour-long test meant to score students’ value as a college candidate, people have largely found it to be an unnecessary obstacle.
For example, if an 18-year-old high school senior is interested in pursuing a degree in filmmaking, their score on the math portion of the SAT should be rendered obsolete. After all, the last time a screenwriter was seen solving a complicated constructed proof was — never, that’s never happened.
Unfortunately, with the way the SAT is scored, it doesn’t matter what degree the student has selected. If admissions deem the score subpar, the chances of being accepted slim down significantly. This expectation for all students to be equally brilliant across all subjects is completely unreasonable.
Next on the docket is the matter of privilege. This point is a little more cut and dry. The truth of the matter is wealthy kids from wealthy families will always have an unfair advantage. If the SAT was abolished tomorrow, silver-spooned Sams and affluent Abbys would still be able to hire a professional essay writer and have their resume carefully reviewed and edited. They have more time to participate in extracurricular activities and afterschool clubs because they don’t have to work and, most obviously, they have disposable income to throw into the tuition well.
Rich kids might make for annoying members of our cohorts, but they definitely make for extremely valuable alumni. How else would USC be able to afford a new Global Supply Chain Institute?
Finally, there’s the marred history of the SAT and of the College Board itself.
In 1926, the College Board was looking for a way to standardize its admissions process. Enter Carl Brigham, a psychology professor at Princeton. He’d written a book called “A Study of American Intelligence” in 1923. In it, Brigham concluded that white Americans, or the “superior Nordic Race,” had the highest intelligence of any other tested American group. He also posited that the nation’s intelligence on the aggregate was declining due to increased immigration from Eastern Europe. This all really tickled the Board’s fancy because three years later, they would ask him to develop what would become the modern SAT.
Look, we live on stolen ground, soaked to the mantle in the blood of immigrants and enslaved, hated and oppressed people of every creed and color. The origin of most things is shrouded in darkness and cruelty. At some point, we must accept that fact or doom ourselves to a lifetime of writing apology notes — negated by some evil act committed against another group of people, simultaneously, somewhere across the globe.
As this archaic form of assessing teenagers’ intelligence slithers down the pipe and straight into Hell, college admissions will have to find other, potentially more personalized ways of deciding whether or not a prospective student makes the cut. In the meantime, the College Board seems a little more interested in pushing commas around and loaning out cinderblock laptops. Why create something new when we can just slap band-aids on the old thing?

For two months beginning in December 2020, researchers from the USC Department of Population and Public Health Sciences conducted focus groups and interviews with Los Angeles high school administrators, teachers, parents and students to examine each group’s attitudes toward in-school coronavirus testing. The study, published last December in peer-reviewed journal “Health Promotion Practice,” was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in an effort to understand the feasibility and efficacy of implementing testing in schools.
High levels of coronavirus transmissions led to school closures in Los Angeles County and across the country. In March 2020, shortly after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Los Angeles Unified School District, composed of 900 campuses serving more than 670,000 students, joined other major California school districts and at least 12 other states in announcing a shutdown of its schools. As the pandemic evolved, schools discussed strategies for safe reopenings, including physical distancing measures, mask mandates, improved cleaning protocols and in-school coronavirus testing.
According to the study, many states provided coronavirus test kits to schools, but anecdotal evidence indicated in-school testing did not factor into several Southern California schools’ plans. The study discovered a few significant barriers to the implementation of in-school testing, including financial and logistical challenges.
“For the schools and school districts to properly implement mitigation strategies, there needs to be proper support for the schools,” Project Director Daniel Soto said. “That could be financial support; it could be helping reduce barriers in terms of access to tests.”
The study’s focus groups and interviews took place over Zoom and followed a structured guide. After transcribing interviews and collecting qualitative data, researchers analyzed the quotes to extract significant themes. The study found that although perspectives differed between stakeholders as a whole, all four groups — administrators, teachers, parents and students — supported testing. 
“Everyone was in favor of kids being tested. It was just a matter of the logistics of doing it,” ​​said Jennifer B. Unger, professor of population and public health sciences in the Keck School of Medicine.
Among school administrators, concerns centered around the financial, logistical and staffing demands of frequent in-school testing, as well as the possible stigma students who test positive might be subjected to. Teachers expressed some discomfort about returning, but thought in-school testing would increase school safety by reducing the number of parents who sent their sick children onto campus. 
Parents agreed with school administrators in their concern about the stigma of testing positive, and shared some of the teachers’ distrust that other parents would keep their sick children at home, a problem they also believed in-school testing would help alleviate. Parents also mentioned the physical discomfort of rapid antigen tests, an inconvenience most students accepted if it would enable them to attend classes in-person. 
One of the greatest challenges to in-school testing illuminated by the study was the difficulty of navigating the logistics of such programs. 
“The biggest take-home message from the study was that schools really need technical assistance to implement a testing program,” Unger said. “You can’t take people who are educators and expect them to suddenly become medical professionals … It’s new for them, and they need some help setting it up.”
According to the study, successful school-based coronavirus testing could not only bring students and faculty safely back on campus faster, but also provide the communities around the schools with better protection and resources to combat the coronavirus.
“There were some neighborhoods in L.A. County that were disproportionately impacted by morbidity and mortality from COVID-19,” Soto said. “The need was really great at the time, not only for how to implement tests, but coming up with a program and design that would work for schools that wouldn’t necessarily impact learning of students.”
Study participants came from nine urban L.A. County school districts, consisting of public, private and charter schools. L.A.County comprises a high proportion of Latinx residents relative to the United States. The research article noted that, given that Latinx individuals are more likely to work as essential workers required to interact with the public and that the rates of vaccination and coronavirus testing among the Latinx population have lagged behind those of non-Hispanic whites, implementing coronavirus testing in schools could help contain the spread of the coronavirus within these communities. 
Although researchers conducted the study last year, Unger said the challenges it highlights remain pertinent during the rapid spread of the omicron variant over recent months. 
“We’re right in the middle of the omicron outbreak, and schools are trying to keep their kids and their staff healthy,” Unger said. “They’re trying to keep sick kids out of school and healthy kids in school, and they really don’t know how to go about doing that.”
While the published article focused on qualitative research, the study also consisted of other components, such as pilot testing programs. Partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, University researchers delivered rapid antigen tests to the learning centers of the department’s “Safer at Parks” program, which launched to offer parents alternatives to at-home remote learning for their children during the pandemic. Researchers also worked to implement rapid antigen testing programs for high school athletes in some L.A. schools. 
“[The study] is like the tip of the iceberg. It is the beginning of us doing a lot more work in the community,” Soto said. “The first step, really, to do proper work in the community is to assess the needs of the community and learn more about barriers and facilitators.”
According to project director Ryan Lee, the understanding of stakeholder concerns, developed through the initial qualitative study, helped University researchers continue their work and research projects with coronavirus testing. Graduate students from the Masters of Public Health, Masters of Social Work and Masters of Education in School Counseling programs currently visit schools to assist with testing as needed, provide training, set up test sites and fill in for personnel shortages.
“Testing can be a really important tool to help keep students safe and it’s actually something that can be done fairly easily,” Lee said. We’re seeing schools take on these massive testing efforts … We’re really excited to be able to continue to help support these schools and help keep students and communities safe.”

In a new stride for a sustainable campus, USC looks to introduce new environmental initiatives, including achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, implementing LED lighting and energy efficiency retrofits and converting energy systems to run on electricity in place of gas. 
Other goals, outlined by Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple in an interview with the Daily Trojan about the neutrality initiative, include converting to electric systems and the installation of on- and off-campus solar panels. 
USC’s final long-term step for achieving carbon neutrality is a carbon reduction removal project, Dalrymple said. The sustainability office is planning to create a task force to define the University’s approach towards offsetting carbon.
“The ideal solution would be something that takes carbon out of the atmosphere, like trees, or what’s called ‘direct air capture,’” Darymple said. “There’s some researchers at USC that have developed methods to remove carbon from the atmosphere.”
Depending on the stage of these University-developed carbon capture technologies, Dalrymple said the University hopes to utilize them both on campus and in the community to reach further carbon reduction goals. 
“The interesting thing is that the carbon emissions are made up of individual contributions, but the impacts are spread out over the globe,” Dalrymple said. “So it’s the cumulative addition and that’s what makes it so hard to tackle.” 
Joshua Goldstein, a professor of history at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, has taught classes on climate change and researched sustainability since 2000. Goldstein said the University’s urgency for sustainability reform is encouraging, but he is concerned about their ability to concretely measure carbon neutrality.
“Carbon neutrality is used by corporations throughout the world, and how you define it is really important to [know] whether it’s truly going to be meaningful … As much as carbon neutrality is a mushy concept, offsets are even mushier and undefined,” Goldstein said. 
Senior Kathleen Verendia, who serves as co-director of the Environmental Student Assembly, said they are curious to see the University’s continued steps for carbon reduction if the school manages to reach carbon neutrality by 2025.
“Reducing carbon emissions in any way possible is always a positive … and I would be interested to know if they will continue if they do become carbon neutral by 2025,” Verendia said. “lf that is the case, it would still be interesting to see them continuously trying to reduce carbon emissions, even if they do technically reach carbon neutrality.” 
If carbon emissions are not immediately addressed, the world may see lasting environmental impacts such as increased wildfires, addressed extreme weather, rising sea levels, species migration and species and human harm, according to Dalrymple. Some environmental changes have even further implications, such as some species’ migration to higher elevations that may disrupt supply chains and cause new diseases. 
Motivated by these climate change threats, the University looks to achieve their goals by 2025. 
“We know from the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] that major global action needs to take place within this decade, before 2030, in order to minimize the negative impacts of climate change by 2050,” Dalrymple said. “To communicate the urgency and how important this is, USC felt like it needed to be a leader and accelerate to get there by 2025.” 
Each year, the University will participate in an annual greenhouse gas inventory where the Office of Sustainability will gather utility bills from around campus. A consultant will use the data to determine annual emissions. 
With a plan to achieve carbon neutrality and become a leader in sustainability, Dalrymple said USC hopes to create a better world for its students and the greater Los Angeles community.
“It’s about USC taking its role as a community leader seriously and showing people what the solutions are,” Dalrymple said. “We realize this is a very important issue and we want other people to also take it very seriously, and the way to do that is to practice it, educate on it, research the solutions and practice the solutions.”
