The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary between Monday, April 23 and Tuesday, April 24.
Crimes against a person
at 1:06 a.m. on April 24, DPS officers responded to a non-USC female who reported that a suspect confronted her in the parking garage at 1207 27th St. and forcibly removed her purse, watch and necklace. The female sustained injuries to her head and mouth and was examined by an LAFD RA unit, but she declined transportation for medical treatment and was released at the scene. LAPD officers also responded and subsequently took over the investigation.
at 8:05 p.M. on April 23, a suspect approached a student who was walking on Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard and grabbed her cellular phone from her hand. The suspect then fled on foot and disappeared from sight. DPS officers responded and conducted a search but were unable to locate the suspect.
Crimes against property
AT 4:59 a.m. on April 24, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect trespassing on the sixth floor of Seeley G. Mudd Building and detained him for investigation. During questioning, the suspect claimed that he was a student, but a check of his name revealed that he was not currently registered. The suspect was then escorted out of the building and released after being advised against trespassing on university property.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:42 p.m. on April 23, a student on 29th Street and Menlo Avenue was cited to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for uncooperative and belligerent behavior with LAPD officers who issued him a citation for drinking in public.
LA needs to bulldoze the surrounding neighbohoods and clear the land for USC expansion. Bring all the students within campus and then have active 2 hour surveillance to stop people who are able to wander in and out. Its time USC got serious.
All this talk about security is a joke coming from the DT. For the longest time this Roundup section was not even updated. I remembering seeing incidents reports that were outdated by over a year and tried to bring it to the attention of the DT editors. I guess it took a few shootings and murders for the University to restate security is a priority for them.
Seriously – if you look back at some of the archives – you will see this Roundup section with 2 year old incidents. I guess no one including the president, DPS or the Editors of DT thought this was an important section to keep updated or that security was something to be mindful of.
Jack’s critic:
Dude you need to get a serious grip!  Things are beyond crazy!  People getting shot!
Kappa Sig is still rushing guys and maybe you are KS material!
^Seriously bro? “shooting the ones who resist” How’d you get into this university?
Keep in mind that we only live here for 4 years. The locals call this area their home. But you probably don’t care about that huh?
this is ridiculous. two robberies in a five hour span, one of them at Jefferson and Fig? DPS needs to start harassing all sketchy locals on sight, and shooting the ones who resist.

The Rossier School of Education announced last week the appointment of Rossier alumna Kalim Rayburn as the new director of alumni engagement in the Office of External Relations.
Rayburn will serve as the manager of career placement and development and will create new ways for alumni to connect with Rossier’s 15,000 alumni. She will also work to enhance external partnerships that help students in their employment search.
Anne Wicks, the associate dean of external relations, said the new position will greatly benefit Rossier.
“There has been a hole in this department for quite a while, and this is a terrific time to fill it,” Wicks said.
Enrollment at Rossier has grown significantly over the last several years, especially in the Master of Arts in Teaching degree program, Wicks said.
“With an ever growing alumni population, we want to make sure we can connect and serve all of our alumni past graduation,” Wicks said.
Before Rayburn’s position was created, Wicks said students used the Career Center for guidance on placement after graduation.
“Dr. Rayburn has terrific entrepreneurial spirit, and having graduated from Rossier last year, she understands the school, programs, faculty and what can best help the alumnus, and she has experience in building, launching and executing successful programs,” Wicks said.

USC’s quest to obtain management control of the 88-year-old Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is long overdue, according to some residents and other members of the community.
The university has been in negotiations with the Coliseum Commission since September, and last week, the commission — the nine-member governing body for the stadium — released a modified lease agreement to the public.
Lease · Community members say they approve of USC gaining managerial control of the Coliseum, but they hope the university will consider public opinion in its decisions. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
Under the proposed lease USC would control the Coliseum, Los Angeles Sports Arena and adjacent parking lots for the next four decades.
“They have proven to be of public service — in the neighborhood and in the hospital,” said Joe Essi, a nearby resident. “Wherever they go, people want them there.”
The lease, which requires USC to make annual rent payments of $1 million, will be subject to a vote later this year, possibly as soon as May 2.
“This is going to be a great opportunity for everyone,” said Charmaine Jefferson, executive director for the California African American Museum in nearby Exposition Park. “[USC has] been a fantastic neighbor and a fantastic partner for us — and I believe here in the Coliseum.”
The Coliseum sits just one block south of USC’s campus. The Trojan football team has played at the venue since 1923 and has been the sole tenant since the mid-1990s after the then-Los Angeles Raiders moved to Oakland, Calif.
One concern raised, though, has been event scheduling and whether public events will continue to be held regularly at the venue.
As outlined by the 92-page document, USC could limit the use of the facility for public interest events, which include the annual Fourth of July celebration, to eight per year.
Cornell Ward, a local resident involved with A Better LA, a non-profit group devoted to preventing gang violence started by former USC coach Pete Carroll, raised this concern with the commission during its monthly meeting April 4. Ward specifically asked that the fireworks celebration be allowed to continue — an event put on in recent years by A Better LA.
“I would hope that we can continue to host that event,” Ward said. “It’s been a fabulous event without one incident.”
Last July, 40,000 people attended the event, Ward said.
The school’s pursuit of the master lease has been, perhaps, most enthusiastically greeted by fans of the football team, who remain optimistic that USC can stay true to its word to renovate the stadium.
“The Coliseum needs a lot of improvements from parking to seats to concessions and bathrooms,” said Matthew Lowry, who has lived in Los Angeles for the last 21 years. “The Coliseum Commission has really done a poor job with USC and the Coliseum, and I feel USC needs to get the master leasing in order to make the upgrades needed to satisfy fans, alumni and themselves.”
USC would be required to make those renovations, according to the proposed lease.
Under the outlined provisions, the school must make various upgrades to the stadium by 2021 — the Coliseum’s 100-year anniversary. Those costs have been estimated at $70 million.
“Arizona State is doing something similar in upgrading Sun Devil Stadium and you see the praise it’s getting now,” Lowry said. “Overall, I’m thrilled about this and it brings nothing but good things not only to ’SC, but L.A. as well.”
Does this mean they will sell beer during SC games?

New Undergraduate Student Government officers said they plan to achieve goals — ranging from increased sustainability to better utilizing the Ronald Tutor Campus Center — by increasing communication and building upon achievements from the past administration.
Over the summer, USG representatives said they plan to solidify their goals and conduct research to ease the pressure when officers return in the fall, USG President Mikey Geragos said. Geragos, USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad and the USG Senate were sworn into office April 3.
“We’ve finalized the team and the budget,” Geragos said. “Now it’s less administrative processes and down to work.”
One priority for Geragos’ administration is to continue the previous administration’s advocacy for increased Campus Center use.
“What [former USG President] Monish Tyagi set out [to] improve at the Campus Center, he accomplished,” Geragos said. “He helped advocate for longer hours and really drove students to use it.”
Geragos and Prasad, however, said that USG is still “getting there,” in terms of developing all that the Campus Center can offer.
“We want to increase the hours even more and, with that, increase student usage,” Prasad said.
Though catering to the concerns and well-being of students is an important goal for USG, many students said the organization seems inaccessible to the general student body.
“When students have a problem or wish they could change something, it seems like they’re often at a loss about who to get in contact with to change it,” Residential Senator Emma Katz said. “They end up just talking among themselves or making a meme about it.”
Prasad said disjointed communication is what the USG Senate hopes to mitigate in the upcoming year by making themselves more accessible to students and truly giving a voice to the student body.
“The [senators] are the ones that represent the student voice, figuring out what it is they want and bringing that back to [the president and vice president],” Prasad said.
USG recognizes the need for student input on issues relevant to campus life, such as sustainability.
“We want to make sure that [students are] being heard when it comes to redevelopment of [EVK Restaurant and Grill] and Café 84,” Geragos said. “We also want to create a full-time director position on sustainability. We want students to be heard as well, not just administrators.”
Geragos and Prasad said they proposed creating a Green Fund. The fund, a pool of about $3 per student, would sponsor sustainability projects on campus.
Many students said they felt that a Green Fund could be a promising way to tackle sustainability.
“That’s a great way of having a sustainable campus,” said Shraddha Chaugule, a doctoral student studying pharmaceutical economics and policy. “That’s not a big amount from every person, put pooled, its really considerable.”
In addition to campus development and administrative concerns, Geragos and Prasad said they also recognize the importance of school spirit and attendance at student events.
Some students said they were disappointed that only a small number of students attended the musical performances organized by Program Board, which is overseen by USG, during the 2011-2012 school year. Cobra Starship, Macklemore and Wolfgang Gartner were among the performers brought to campus by Program Board.
William Herron, an undeclared freshman, was impressed with the performers but wished the events had been better publicized.
“[USG] should increase promotion for these events,” Herron said. “They got pretty big names, but all I really saw was one Facebook page about it. There was nothing else really promoting it.”
Geragos said he is committed to improving publicity.
“There is a big emphasis [on] the best talent for any and all events we put on,” Geragos said. “It’s really important to me.”

President Barack Obama will seek to obtain a one-year extension on the current interest rate on federal student loans in Congress before the rates double to 6.8 percent July 1.
The increased interest rates could have dramatic effects on financial aid and students’ ability to repay their tuition.
“I’ve always believed that we should be doing everything we can to put our education in reach for every American student,” Obama said in a conference call to student journalists. “In America, higher education can’t be a luxury. It’s an economic imperative that every family [must] be able to afford.”
It is necessary for Congress to extend the current interest rates on student loans because higher education must continue to be within the economic means of every American, Obama said.
Cecilia Muñoz, an assistant to the president and director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said in a press conference that extending the current interest rate on student loans would be helpful in maintaining high levels of employment and income within the nation.
“We know that students who complete a college education earn twice that of what people who don’t have a college education earn,” Muñoz said. “Ultimately, the best way to grow the economy, make sure we have the best prepared workers to compete in the global economy and to make sure that a college education is affordable is to ensure the student loan rate doesn’t double this July.”
Muñoz also said the one-year extension would only be a short-term solution and Congress would need to pass additional legislation in the future to ensure students pay low interest rates on their student loans.
“In the Congress, in the short-term, we want a one-year stop gap effort, but we intend to use that year — assuming we are successful — to make sure we have a robust conversation about higher education in the Congress that includes keeping interest rates low,” Muñoz said.
Roberto Rodríguez, special assistant to the president for education policy, said the Obama administration has created other new pieces of legislation to assist students in financing higher education.
“Last fall, the president announced an expansion on the income-based repayment program,” Rodríguez said. “This option will enable students to cap their student monthly payments on their loans to 10 percent of their monthly income, and students that work and maintain those repayments after 20 years would have that loans’ debt forgiven.”
Alex Kludjian, public relations director of USC College Republicans, said even though this move might be popular among students who receive federal student loans, it could also be fiscally irresponsible.
“You can’t just get money from the government and then not pay it back without there being some fiscal impact,” Kludjian said. “Students would obviously welcome this decision, but [one must] ask if this is actually fiscally responsible.”
Why do the interest rates have to double? Why don’t they shrink? Holding back the financial hobgoblin isn’t the same as chopping it in half. It’s just keeping things the same, not actual change.
Come on Obama, you can do better, man.

USC junior Valeria Pulido earned Pac-12 Player of the Week for the first time in her career after clinching the win for No. 4 USC (20-3, 9-1) in its 6-1 upset over No. 1 UCLA (21-2, 8-2) last Friday.
Pulido’s 6-3, 7-5 victory over Kaitlyn Ray on court 6 guaranteed USC a share of the Pac-12 championship for the first time since 2009.
Helping hand · Junior Valeria Pulido won the singles match that ultimately led to the Women of Troy’s victory against top-ranked UCLA. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The victory over UCLA in Westwood snapped USC’s six-game losing streak against the Bruins, who last lost to USC in April 2009.
In USC’s 4-3 win over No. 8 California on April 14, Pulido also captured the winning point with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 finish over Alice Duranteu on court 6.
Pulido now has a seven-match win streak in singles and stands at 5-0 in Pac-12 play and 9-0 in dual matches. She is 10-5 overall this season.
In doubles, Pulido and freshman Zoë Scandalis are 7-2 in Pac-12 play and 18-6 overall as the No. 54 pair in the nation.
Pulido is the fourth Trojan to win Pac-12 Player of the Week this season, joining sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshmen Gabriella DeSimone and Scandalis.
USC will now advance to the postseason, starting with the Pac-12 championships in Ojai, Calif.
Three USC players will compete in a 32-player draw for the singles title and one USC duo will contend for the doubles title among 16 teams in the four-day tournament beginning Thursday.

I have a confession to make.
For four years now, I have been trying to mask the obvious with every key stroke and article produced.
But before entering the campus walls in August 2008, I had no love or, for that matter, respect, for the USC athletic program.
I didn’t grow up going to the Coliseum on Saturdays in the fall, the Sports Arena, Dedeaux Field or the North Gym on spring afternoons.
Frankly, no one in my house ever talked about Heisman Trophies, Song Girls, marching bands or what it even meant to have school spirit.
In the interest of full disclosure, I’m the only one in my family to ever go to a BCS school, let alone a school that prides itself not only in academics but in athletics as well.
The idea seemed foreign to me.
And to be completely honest, while fans of the Trojans saw themselves as a part of the history, the mystique, the aura that comes with being associated with the Cardinal and Gold, I simply couldn’t relate and oftentimes took their pride as a sign of arrogance.
So much so that I boycotted the school I would eventually call home during their national championship game on that January night in 2006 and rooted for those Longhorns in burnt orange.
Needless to say, times have certainly changed.
When I came here four years ago I was warned that upon exiting it would finally hit me. And it certainly has.
It, of course, is the love affair between a student and his school, between a writer and his athletic program, between two parties that years ago would never have seemed to be a perfect match.
There have been championships, instant classics, sanctions, bowl games and everything in between during my four years covering the USC athletic program, and yet that isn’t what I’ll remember.
What I’ve learned is that, underneath the helmets and in between the sidelines, are people just like you and me.
They may play a coach or a quarterback or a sprinter or a power forward for a few hours every afternoon or night, but at the end of the day they are human. They endure the same struggles, the same moments of happiness, the same challenges we all face in our own lives.
Some will say I missed out on a chance to cover a golden era in the school’s history and that may be so.
But I won’t look back on my time wishing the football team had made it to a national championship game or the men’s or women’s basketball team had made it to a Final Four. Sure, those moments would have added great meaning to the experience, but when you have an opportunity to meet and to get to know the young men and women that represent our university on an athletic field, you learn that there is more to sports than wins and losses.
I witnessed junior cornerback Nickell Robey honor his late mother in the months after she passed, redshirt senior running back Curtis McNeal fight his way from the streets of Los Angeles to the grass of the Coliseum, junior coxswain Dionne Licudine lead the USC rowing team to victory just a month after laying in a hospital, and have personally had the opportunity to cover numerous Trojan athletes as they worked on service projects in the community during their off hours.
From this, I realized that the USC athletic program’s greatest strength isn’t having some of the top athletes in the world: It’s having some of the top people in the world as well.
Sports can be a welcomed distraction, a connection to our childhood or a chance to feel a part of something bigger than ourselves.
But at USC it’s really all of those things and more. It’s a community of thousands. It’s a relationship passed down from generation to generation. It’s a chance to sing, to tailgate, to yell, to embrace the moment for what it is.
It’s an opportunity to be inspired by your peers achieving their dreams, with the hopes that one day you too will achieve yours. It’s a social interaction that doesn’t rely on knowledge of the game but rather love for one’s school. It’s a party with 90,000 of your closest relatives or a quiet moment in the hall of humbling achievements.
It’s about feeling a sense of belonging, and whether in a press box, the student section, at midfield, the sidelines or in the nosebleed seats, that’s what I will remember most. It never mattered what sport I was covering, what the score was or if the game had any meaning in the standings. For me, it was always about getting a chance to feel like I was home.
I never really took time to reflect on this until these very words hit the page, but for the guy who entered USC with no allegiance, loyalty or, for that matter, interest in the well-being of the USC athletic program, I will leave thoroughly in love with what it represents and what it has meant to me during my college tenure.
These days are fleeting for all us, whether you are a freshman two semesters in or a senior with one foot out the door.
My one pearl of wisdom is the next time you take in a sporting event on campus, do so with open eyes. Take in the crowd, the spectacle and the beauty of it all. Whether you know the athletes or not, appreciate their skill, the work they do when no one’s looking and the way they conduct themselves whether it’s in a crunch time situation or in a hospital visit.
These things might not make sense now, but when life starts pushing you outside the friendly confines of this university, you’ll understand.
Trust me, it’s never too late to say I love you. Four years later, I can proudly tell you that.

Even after a loss, there is usually some sort of chatter. Talk about what could have gone better or what went wrong.
But following the Trojans (20-16) 1-0 loss to Long Beach State (19-19) on Tuesday, there was nothing.
“I don’t know what to say, really,” USC coach Frank Cruz said. “Tonight was just baseball. We competed. We just didn’t get the hit we needed.”
No contact · Senior outfielder Alex Sherrod (above) was unable to collect a hit against the Dirtbag’s pitching staff Tuesday night. As a team, the Trojans collected just four hits in the nine inning affair. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
Indeed, the Trojans had four hits the entire game against six different pitchers. Long Beach State had three hits against five different pitchers.
With the game scoreless in the top of the seventh, Dirtbag first baseman Ino Patron lead off with the single. Third baseman Michael Hill followed that with what was arguably the game’s most important play: a sacrifice bunt that put Patron in scoring position for pinch-hitter Brennan Fulkerson, who singled to right for the game’s only RBI.
Long Beach State threatened in the sixth as well, putting runners at the corners with one out against senior pitcher Ben Mount. But a well-turned third-to-second-to-first double play got the Trojans out of that jam.
The Trojans also threatened little throughout the game. Senior first baseman Matt Foat was thrown out at home trying to score from second on a single in the fourth inning, and freshman left fielder Dante Flores nearly smacked a two-run home run to right in the sixth, but the ball was caught on the warning track.
“With two outs, we’re gonna put the pressure on,” Cruz said. “They made a good play and threw us out.”
The Trojans had not played since last Wednesday, when they blew a three-run ninth inning lead against UC Santa Barbara and lost in 12 innings. With nearly a week of that sour taste in their mouths, the team was looking to right the ship before a tough three game set against Oregon State this weekend. While they couldn’t do that, Cruz seemed much less troubled by his team’s performance against the Dirtbags than he was against UCSB.
“Tonight we competed,” Cruz said. “We pitched well, we had some chances. We’re in a funk right now.”
Apart from an 11 run outburst against Cal State Bakersfield last Tuesday, the Trojans have scored just six runs in their last five games. And in the 48 innings they have played in those five games, they have scored runs in just three of them.
The Dirtbags are 9-2 in their last 11, and avenged a 4-2 loss at the hands of the Trojans in both teams’ fourth game of the season down in Long Beach.

Today, the word masterpiece gets thrown around carelessly. It would be a great disservice, however, to call British band The Maccabees’ newest album, Given to the Wild, anything other than a perfect piece of art — a creative triumph.
Though most albums are lucky to receive praise for poetic lyrics or the sultry sounds of the singer’s voice, Given to the Wind is a rare combination of catchy tunes backed by beautiful, sometimes haunting, lyrics that mix together to create a concoction of pure awe. It might sound hyperbolic to give such a compliment, but Given to the Wind delivers.

The album begins with an introduction reminiscent of Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which almost serves as an ode to childhood. “Given to the Wind (Intro)” is a dark track, one that sets the tone for the album with the faded moans of lead singer Orlando Weeks.
This eerie vibe continues with “Child,” one of the highlights of the album, which reminds wary listeners that lyrics can inspire and actually mean something.
Poetry seems to be the only way to describe it: “Never as a child / Would you give this time of day / You would take it from the shadows / And you give it another name.” Combined with Weeks’ haunting vocals and instrumentals, including horns and guitar combined with a strong drum base, the song continues the album’s impressive start.
The album stays strong with “Feel to Follow,” a pleasant little ditty that almost sounds like a reggae tune washed down with some English tea. But like most of the band’s songs, the varying sounds drift in and out throughout the duration of the track. Though it starts out sounding like a more-upbeat version of a tune from indie band The xx, “Feel to Follow” soon transforms into an epic song, perfectly suited for a dramatic film score.
But the album isn’t all fun and games. “Forever I’ve Known” strays from the album’s upbeat start and takes a dark turn. Lyrics like “I’m a child to your voice / To the sound, oh, it can eat me alive,” makes the longing in Weeks’ voice seem physically tangible.
Similarly, “Heave” maintains a dark edge as it slowly grows from silence into a rustling chorus of harmonies reminiscent of the very best from Bon Iver.
“Given to the Wind,” however, soon turns back to lighter fare. Dramatic lyrics pair brilliantly with catchy beats, creating a solid balance. “Pelican” amps the energy up even more: The leading single packs a punch with a rhythm that recalls classic Queen.
The hits continue like a wave building up to an inevitable crash on the shore; “10 Go” is an emotional roller coaster that you’ll want to ride again and again. The sprawling notes create an epic sound filled to the brim, comparable to that of a cinematic wonder.
With an album as strong as Given to the Wild, it can be sincerely jarring when missteps occur. “Unknow,” a much more sinister addition to the album, is a prime example. Though Weeks continues to show off impressive vocals, the unusual guitar riffs and female background vocals cause the song to feel out of place compared to the rest of the album. It’s a great song on its own, but “Unknow” simply feels unnatural in the mix.
“Grew Up at Midnight,” on the other hand, works perfectly as a conclusion to the album. An ominous ode to childhood, “Grew Up at Midnight” provides one last bang, and genuinely inspires excitement over the prospect of seeing this band on tour.
Given to the Wind will most likely be The Maccabees’ breakout album even though this is the band’s third full-length effort. Somehow, the band manages to sound both epic and intimate at the same time, attaining the sort of balance that allowed Kings of Leon’s Only by the Night to be so successful back in 2008. Though the sounds and lyrics are intricate, The Maccabees manage to make it all sound so effortless.

If it’s true that the Danes live to eat, the Norwegians eat to live and the Swedes eat to drink, then it must also be said that Americans eat to experience other cultures.
And it is with fervor that the restaurant industry has attached itself to the cultures of Scandinavia.
It’s not unprecedented. The food scenes of Sweden and Denmark, especially, have been quietly calling out to the most food-focused travelers for years.
When the World’s Best Restaurant Awards are announced April 30, it will be Noma’s name everyone looks for in the No. 1 spot: Indeed, the Copenhagen-based restaurant has claimed the honor for the past two years.
Furthermore, Noma’s chef, René Redzepi, was just named one of two restaurant industry people on Time Magazine’s list of the 100 Most Influential People — the other was The Bazaar’s chef and restauranteur José Andrés.
But what does an obscenely expensive restaurant located inside a converted warehouse all the way across the Atlantic have to do with L.A. food culture?
First, one must look to the overall American adaptation of international cuisines.
Spain’s now-shuttered El Bulli was the No. 1 restaurant in the world when tapas, or small plates, became a hot sell in the United States almost a decade ago. And for most of the century earlier, France, with food legends like Paul Bocuse and Georges Auguste Escoffier, was the world’s gastronomic gold standard; as a result, that particular French way of cooking — with lots of butter and lots of flair — became the eventual norm here in the states too.
But back to Scandinavian food in America. One can credit Marcus Samuelsson, who made waves at his New York restaurant Red Rooster Harlem for popularizing Scandinavian fusion, with elements of soul food, New York food and Ethopian food, only a year and a half ago.
And the restaurant industry’s renewed interest in smoked and cured fishes, or fish charcuterie, also parallels a very Scandinavian approach: One cannot enter any restaurant in Copenhagen without encountering pickled herring or thin, glassy slices of smoked salmon.
Of course, there’s another major factor at play here. It’s called IKEA.
There’s always that friend who goes to IKEA only for the food, walking through the massive store just to get a plate of gravy-covered meatballs with a dollop of mashed potatoes.
And though not every restaurant will serve such obvious Scandinavian fare, the region’s flavors, earthy and bright and even briny, have been noticeable on more and more menus across the nation.
Next time you order roast chicken at a restaurant, see if that dish is accompanied with potatoes and asparagus or wild mushrooms and green herbs. If it’s the latter, as is quickly becoming the case, you’re already receiving a hint of this Scandinavian style.
The West Hollywood restaurant Red Medicine claims to be inspired by Vietnamese cuisine, and many of its dishes are. Credit should go too, though, to the Swedes: A vegetable dish of snap peas comes mixed with trout roe, while spot-prawn roe accompanies some Dutch white asparagus. The “plucked from the ground, plucked from the sea” approach is modern Scandinavian food at its best.
Another West Hollywood hotspot, Michael Voltaggio’s ink., serves its Malpeque oysters in terra-cotta garden pots filled with stones under which a fog of dried ice — or something remarkably similar —  emanates. And the restaurant’s bar hosts trays of wispy herbs and plants of which chefs pluck tiny flowers to place atop tuna or garnish salads.
Popular Scandinavian foods like smørrebrød, the open-faced sandwich topped with any assortment of spreads, herbs and proteins, are also appearing in disguised forms around the city.
Brentwood’s Farmshop has a version with long slices of toasted bread, spread sweet-potato purée and some punchy toasted broccolini on top.
It’s no surprise, either — we’ve happily adapted banh mi and pozole into the American food vernacular. Why not smørrebrød?
One can hope that the Scandinavian food trend is here to stay. If good food and happiness really do have an intrinsic connection, then knowing the people of Denmark, Sweden and Finland are often credited as the world’s happiest only further highlights the benefits of emulating certain foreign countries.
Decades from now, when we’re dining with our families at Swedish meatball parlors and smiling incandescently, food historians will look back at the dining scene of the early 2010s and mark the decade as the start of the American-Scandinavian food revolution.

As tough times fall upon a group of hard-working miners, a young boy steps up to take his place — not in the mines but at the ballet bar.
In British musical phenomenon Billy Elliot, now playing at the Pantages Theatre, reality meets dreams.

Picture this: The year is 1984. The scene is the old mining town of Durham, England. The problem? Margaret Thatcher and the government threaten to close down the mines, uprooting the livelihood of all miners. And amid all the testosterone-fueled rage, a ballet dancer is born: Billy Elliot.
Young, motherless Billy (J.P. Viernes) finds himself knocked out of his boxing lessons and into Mrs. Wilkinson’s (Leah Hocking) ballet class. With a few pushes and pulls of strategically movable set pieces by the cast members as they dance, the show’s stage transforms before the audience’s eyes from the gritty, barren street  — full of angry miners — to Mrs. Wilkinson’s prim community dance studio with fluttering ballerinas.
Rich Herbert and Cullen R. Titmas, who brilliantly play Billy’s gruff father and Billy’s stubborn, impulsive brother, respectively, bring raw emotion to the stage, perfectly portraying the pressures of the miners’ strike on family life. As the youngest member of the family, Billy doesn’t notice the repercussions of the strike but feels another inner struggle as he grows into a beautiful ballet dancer.
After the death of Billy’s mother (Kat Hennessey), Billy turns to his grandmother (Patti Perkins) for hope and support. Perkins does a superb job at setting the audience up and surprising them with the unexpected.
One anticipates “We’d Go Dancing” to be a song of loving tales of a 33-year marriage, but Perkins instead whips into an almost four-minute-long rant about how much she hated her husband, the “son-of-a-bitch,” except for their drunken nights out dancing. Perkins brings spitfire to the elderly character, singing, “But if I went through my time again, oh I’d do it without the help of men, or at least your granddad / If I’d only known then what I know now, I’d have given them all the finger.”
Perkins isn’t the only example of the play’s high quality: The power of Billy Elliot emerges through the strength and dynamic nature of its characters.
Elton John’s musical score and Lee Hall’s famous book and lyrics are brought to life by the performances of the show’s triple-threat cast, along with the chemistry they have with one another and charisma they share with the audience.
Then there is also Billy’s chain-smoking, rough-around-the-edges, washed-up ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson.
Hocking’s blatantly over-the-top humor is hysterical and refreshing, and though she can be painfully critical at times, it’s clear that she’s the only one who believes in Billy from the start.
Director Stephen Daldry, along with choreographer Peter Darling, stage the show wonderfully and execute a variety of dance styles, with everything from little ballet girls en pointe to young Billy gracefully dancing along with an older self in a dream sequence to burly miners partaking in combat-like dance with police.
And in what is perhaps the most enticing number, “Solidarity,” the frilly moves of the ballerinas tangle with the abrupt and clunky moves of the grimy, frustrated miners; the combination creates an intriguingly stark contrast. On another standout note, Billy’s eleventh-hour soliloquy “Electricity” brings a vulnerable yet liberating feel.
The role of Billy is alternately played by five different boys, ages 13 to 15, and each actor has unique choreography for the “Electricity” number, designed to show off their strengths and passion. J.P. Viernes is the oldest of the Billys, and not only acts but also sings and dances with a passion and expertise beyond his 15 years.
As one can imagine, the musical runs the gamut of emotions: despair, optimism, rage, desire and love — all cushioned by a dose of wit and sarcasm. The humor brings some levity to the play at the same time that the severity of the miners’ suffering and persistence adds depth.
“Billy Elliot is a story that sits well with any performer,” said Vanessa Russo, a swing in the cast. “It’s a child finding his passions and dream and just going for it. That’s what any performer, dancer or artist goes through.”
The show’s inspiring story, however, does not resonate solely with other performers. “It’s about finding your passions and dreams at a young age and knowing what you love, no matter what that may be,” Russo said.
 
Billy Elliot plays at the Pantages Theatre through May 13, 2012. Performances are Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 2:00 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sundays at 1:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.
Simply the best show that you will ever see!

With only six months to go until the presidential election, it’s difficult to say who will win. The most recent polls put President Barack Obama and unofficial Republican nominee Mitt Romney in a virtual tie.
Political commentators say the state of the economy will determine the winner. Supposedly, if the economy improves between now and November, Obama will be the winner; if it stays the same or gets worse, he will lose.
Though this argument might seem to make sense, it begs the following question: Why should the last six months of a four-year presidency define its success? Shouldn’t 3½ years be more than enough of an evaluation period? Most of Obama’s first term is over. It should already be clear whether his economic policies are what we would like to see again.
So why are we at such an impasse?
It has been difficult for either side to gain traction because the traditional ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans was built for another time, and the arguments simply don’t fit today’s realities.
Economically, we face something we haven’t seen before. Politically, the same should be true: Candidates should be saying things we haven’t heard before. But rather than reshaping their traditional ideological positions to reflect new realities, both parties have instead chosen to become more entrenched in their historic personas.
After the Great Depression, Keynesian economics dominated the American system, drawing on lessons learned from the crisis to stimulate demand through spending during recessionary periods. This policy lasted until the mid-70s, when inflation proved to be an unwanted side effect of too much expansionary activity. From that point forward, we witnessed the revival of laissez-faire economics, mixed with a newly conceived supply-side school of thought.
Following the crash in 2008, the Keynesian mindset was brought back in a big way to help spend our way out of a recession. This time, however, we ended up finding failure on a different level than before. Debt, rather than inflation, became the issue.
Our exorbitant federal debt, now at more than 100 percent of gross domestic product, is hampering our ability to stimulate a sluggish economy. It even calls into question the credit-worthiness of the U.S. government.
How can we stimulate the economy — whether through the stimulus policies of the left or the supply-side incentives of the right — when debt is so high?
Democrats claim that Republicans are stuck in the past, only looking out for big businesses and Wall Street — think the Occupy movement. Republicans claim that Obama represents big government and wastefulness — think Tea Party.
This intellectual divide is nothing new, but the situation has completely changed.
It seems the public realizes the debate is stale but doesn’t know what to do about it. As the presidential election draws nearer, students should keep candidates’ willingness to adapt to new realities in mind.

Almost 20 years ago, when most of us were in our early infancies, Los Angeles was burning.
The acquittal of the four Los Angeles Police Department officers involved in the beating of Rodney King sparked one of the most incendiary events in L.A. history. Violence riddled the landscape. It brought to the forefront many grievances that, until then, had been grumbled as complaints.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Along with an assortment of panels and events, The Riot Within: My Journey From Rebellion To Redemption — the new memoir by Rodney King — has made sure that the riots are not forgotten. But these mementos shouldn’t simply remind us of what happened: They need to serve as a catalyst for further efforts to improve the relationship between the LAPD and the communities it serves.
The police department has come a long way in 20 years. An independent commission investigating the LAPD’s practices after King’s beating — but before the riots ignited — found “excessive force, racist cops, indifferent commanders and disdain for residents,” according to reports. The situation was bleak, and the Rampart scandal that took place two years later only served to aggravate it.
In the wake of the riots, however, the seeds for improvement were sewn. Community policing was introduced in an effort to build trust between the LAPD and L.A. residents. According to the U.S. Department of Justice’s website, community policing is “a philosophy that promotes … the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques.”
The 77th Street Division, which stretches from Watts to Inglewood, had 143 homicides in 1992. That figure decreased to 32 in 2011. The area is not the safest place to live in, but the improvement is there. Residents of troubled areas approach LAPD officers for solutions much more often. Altercations that could escalate into violence between police officers and residents are diffused with talk and reason.
A recent poll by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University found that 70 percent of L.A. residents approve of the police force that was at the center of such unrest two decades ago. Still, things are not as good as they could be. Seventy percent means that out of every 10 residents, three are dissatisfied with the way the LAPD goes about its business. Yes, approval polls are a sketchy business, but many holders of public office — like the president, for example — would be delighted with such a score.
But an approval rating for an entity like the LAPD is different. The LAPD was founded more than 143 years ago, and it will be around for the foreseeable future. An approval rating like the one the LAPD has must be earned over time through building trust. A willingness to cooperate, however, is still lacking from L.A. residents and the LAPD.
At USC, we have had to interact with the LAPD more often than usual in the last few weeks. Two graduate students were fatally shot, and a DPS officer shot an armed man on 30th street. The officers have shown how far they have come in their ability to handle tough situations.
The LAPD still receives some animosity — especially from younger people, whose pastimes are more likely to skirt the boundaries of legality. These feelings, however, have greatly diminished in the last 20 years. If the department continues using community policing, its approval rating will reflect more trust from the community.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and anthropology. His column “72 Degrees and Shaking” ran Wednesdays.
 
Why are there so many articles about the riots focusing on the improvements LAPD made and still needs to make with the community? Why are we so fearful of talking about the pink elephant in the room? South Central LA needs to improve itself and just dropping “Central” from its name will not make for substantive improvements. In fact those stupid, superficial, symbolic “solutions” are the kind of ridiculous salve for the wound our failing politicians gravitate towards – hoping their constituents are dumb enough to play along.
By and large ask any USC student today if their relationship with their parents was instrumental at their acceptance into USC or their relationship with their local police dept. Of course it is the parents of the people in South Central LA that are in a position to affect the lives of their kids and future generations to come. Why do we not talk about fathers sticking around to raise the babies they make. Why not talk about single young mothers struggling to raise 3 kids by themselves – only to maintain lifestyle choices that put them on a collision course with baby number 4. Seriously – how may typical USC students even ever had a run in with their local police dept or care? The ones that never had any trouble with their local police dept are also the ones that most likely had parents that were responsible and willing to actually parent their kids.
We can talk about all the community policing we want but until kids have intelligent, responsible parents to raise them – these generations of South Central LA kids will always be bickering and squabbling with the law. I challenge any liberal, naive person to witness first hand what these cops go through patrolling some of the most dangerous streets in the US and put yourself in their shoes everytime you want to open your mouth and start to say “if I was that officer, I would have done…” You sound ridiculous.

No. 5 USC women’s rowing continued their hot start to the season, winning seven of their eight races at the Stanford Women’s Invitational on Saturday against no. 11 Stanford, no. 15 Michigan State and no. 17 Notre Dame.
The varsity eight boat started the morning by posting the fastest time of the day (6:21.2), beating Notre Dame by 11 seconds, as well as the times of Stanford, Michigan State, California and Washington.
The Women of Troy’s second varsity eight followed the strong start by beating Notre Dame 6:37.7 to 6:40.6 while never trailing throughout the course of the race.
USC’s only loss of the day was in their final event against Notre Dame, who out-rowed USC’s varsity four in the final 750 meters to open up a close race and beat the Women of Troy 7:17.8 to 7:20.5.
The Women of Troy would bounce back from their only loss of the day, winning all three events in the afternoon against Michigan State.
USC’s varsity eight remains undefeated for the season after beating Michigan State by almost a 10-second margin (6:23.5 to 6:32.5).
USC’s second varsity eight faced more of a challenge in their race, but still came out with winning time of 6:37.7, almost three seconds faster than Michigan State.
The day’s closest race involved the USC varsity four, which managed a hard-fought first victory of the season against Michigan State. Senior coxswain Caroline Trawick, Chloe Roddy, Caroline Sederowsky, Madelyn Walters, and Jelena Miladinovic finished in 7:27.4, just ahead of Michigan State’s 7:28.6.
The Women of Troy continue their season against UCLA at their home course in San Pedro, Calif. on Saturday, April 28.

The Coachella double-header has come to a close and in honor of the event, we bring you a selection of articles from around the web that examine, mock and celebrate this beloved/notorious (depending who you ask) cultural phenomenon.
Funny or Die: “7 Types of People at Coachella”
Coachella has become somewhat well-known for attracting a diverse selection of weirdos. Perhaps that’s not fair, as the festival is now so iconic that it attracts basically all types of people, but at any rate Dashiell Driscoll’s snarky enumeration of Coachella archetypes is funny and apt. Driscoll’s overall message is that Coachella has become much less about the music than about the overall experience, man (i.e. all of the drugs, man).
Cracked: “MARIJUANA AT COACHELLA?!?” 
This one speaks for itself.
LA Times: “Three-digit temps bring fatigue and thinner crowds”
Coachella tickets are freaking expensive, so it makes sense that festivalgoers flipped a collective sh*t this last weekend when too-high temperatures threatened to spoil the fun. Nevertheless, even though police officers told crowds to “take it easy on both alcohol and sugary drinks,” this was Coachella, so of course they didn’t.
Rolling Stone: “Diehard Coachella Fans Double Down on This Year’s Fest” 
There is something sweetly endearing about the double-attendees interviewed for this article, all of whom would probably go to Coachella every weekend if Coachella were held every weekend.  Per one fan: “The Monday after the first one, I was kind of licking my wounds and I said, ‘Hey, let’s go again!’”
Know Your Meme: “Tupac Hologram”
Much of the buzz about this year’s Coachella has centered on the hologram Tupac (which was technically not a hologram) who performed on-stage at each of the two Coachellas alongisde Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. Some of the more popular memes poke fun at the image itself, e.g. placing Tupac as a ghost at the end of Return of the Jedi, but others mock the audience-members themselves for overreacting to the trick.
