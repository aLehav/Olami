The USC Marshall School of Business’ Sports Business Institute and the USA TODAY Sports Media Group announced a new partnership to create an online platform for covering the business of sports on Tuesday.
The new website, “The Fields of Green,” will utilize curated blog posts, columns and multimedia to offer analysis on breaking news and trends in the sports industry. Combining the acumen of experts and key players in the industry, the site will provide insight on factors such as media trends and new technologies affecting the sports business.
“We are so pleased to be working with the USA TODAY Sports Media Group. Fields of Green brings something completely new to the table: timely, incisive analysis of issues in sports from a business perspective,” said David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute and a national authority on sports business and strategic marketing, in a press release. “It’s a niche that no one else is filling, and a tremendous opportunity to shed light on the developments driving the sports business industry today.”
Founded in 2005, the Sports Business Institute, housed within USC Marshall, was the first of its kind at a major academic institution and, according to its website, is “focused on understanding and furthering the sports business industry” through collaborative events, research and student-led consulting.  In 2010, the institute published the book Money Games: Profiting from the Convergence of Sports and Entertainment.
The goal of the partnership is to combine the global expertise of Marshall’s SBI with the global reach of USA TODAY. SBI will provide in-depth analysis and feature content for the website, and USA TODAY will provide the administrative and technological infrastructure to create the new online platform. Formed in 2011, the Sport’s Media Group sites are consistently among the top five most visited sports sites in North America, according to analytics firm ComScore.
“Fields of Green will leverage our position as the top source of sports news and information in the country to expose a broad audience to the USC Sports Business Institute’s cutting-edge insight and seasoned analysis,” Dave Morgan, president of the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, said in a press release. “The synergies between us make our two organizations a solid match.”

David Leonhardt, the editor of  “The Upshot,” a New York Times website focusing on politics and public policy, visited the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Tuesday to discuss how mathematics is mixing with the news industry.
Roundtable discussion · On Tuesday, David Leonhardt met with students in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum in Annenberg. Leonhardt expressed to students the importance of reporters telling more than just a story. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Leonhardt is at the forefront of the growing world of “nerd journalism,” a term he uses to describe a new way to convey news using data, analytics and statistics.
“We are not shy about being nerdy,” Leonhardt said. “We all want to be the nerdiest.”
He explained that the website’s goal is to improve clarity surrounding important events.
“Our basic mission is to write about big, complicated events in a conversational way,” Leonhardt said. “We want to help people understand events they otherwise may have trouble comprehending.”
Leonhardt started The Upshot at The New York Times to fill the void left by Nate Silver after he took his immensely popular FiveThirtyEight blog to ESPN.  Silver famously correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states in the 2012 presidential election, creating popular interest in data-driven journalism. The Upshot will now look to capitalize on this growing field by taking more unconventional routes to report news.
“In order to give people information that they don’t already have, journalists now often need to go a level deeper,” Leonhardt said. “One of the ways to do that is to do nerd journalism. It is to go heavily into the numbers behind something, get really wonky about it and try to explain to people what is going on in a way an                     eleven-hundred word newspaper story cannot.”
In an age where housing foreclosures and unemployment rates are staples on the front pages of newspapers across the country, Leonhardt and The Upshot want to ensure that anyone can interpret the news.
“People want to understand the details and the numbers and the facts that they are surrounded by in a very deep way,” Leonhardt said.
The Upshot will feature not only in-depth reporting and infographics, but also data-driven charts, tables and animations to help readers understand complex topics.
“What we are doing is really nerdy stuff,”  Leonardt said. “Yet it is all meant to appeal to people who don’t have any sort of expertise, who don’t have any sort of degree in economics. I like to think of the audience for this type of journalism as really smart people who come into something knowing absolutely nothing.”
The evolution of  “nerd journalism” forces the next generation of reporters and writers to do more than just tell a story, Leonhardt said.
“I want an article to teach me something that I don’t already know,” Leonhardt said. “A lot of times, I don’t really care if you show me something showing that you covered a big story. What I’m looking for is something that can help me understand something even better. It’s writing a story that no one else has written.”

Last night’s USG meeting featured the proposal of a resolution by the Queer and Ally Student  Assembly, which is arguing for gender-neutral housing in university-sponsored housing complexes and apartments.
The resolution, which was sponsored by Senator Brianna Thorpe and Vice President Rini Sampath, is a response to USC’s enforcement of a “gender binary,” or a male/female split in university housing arrangements. Under current university policy, USC relies on the registered sex of students to place students in housing.
“The current policy reinforces gender identities that are not representative of the entire Trojan Family,” Thorpe said.
Under the current policy, students who might not identify as male or female must fill out their gender on housing applications, and be assigned housing based on their answer.
Though USC currently has a “Rainbow Floor,”  a special interest residential community that currently provides gender neutral housing,  proponents of the resolution believe that this is not enough, especially compared to other schools.
“We’re actually behind many top universities,” said former Greek Senator Logan Heley. “Other universities in the Pac-12 and elsewhere already have gender-neutral housing in place.”
The proposed resolution would create a gender neutral option on student housing applications for students who do not identify within the gender binary. University suite-style housing complexes such as Trojan and Cardinal Gardens would be restructured to accommodate gender-neutral housing.
“The benefit is non-discrimination of people with different gender identities,” said QuASA representative Quyên Nguyen-Le. “Our school’s  non-discrimination clause, as well as California state law, includes protection based on gender identity.”
Six hundred and fourteen students have signed a petition supporting the resolution, as well as department officials in USC.
Supporters of the resolution believe that it is a smart financial decision as well.
“USC’s probably losing business by not offering this,” Heley said. “Students [who prefer gender neutral housing] are going to private apartments, whose owners don’t care as long as they get a check.”
The USG Senate will vote on the resolution next week.

On Tuesday afternoon, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation held an 18-student  sit-in outside of President C. L. Max Nikias’ office at Bovard Auditorium in protest to the university’s business relations with JanSport, an apparel brand whose parent company, the VF Corporation, SCALE claims has been directly linked to the deaths of numerous workers in factory collapses.
Sit-in for justice · Eighteen students from SCALE waited outside Nikias’ office on Tuesday to negotiate ending business relations with JanSport. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
 
SCALE launched its campaign in consistency with a national movement by United Students Against Sweatshops after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in April 2013, which was one of the largest industrial disasters in the history of the garment industry.
Participants of the sit-in entered Bovard at approximately 3:30 p.m. and were locked out of President Nikias’ office, sitting in the hallway near the office doors. The students remained within Bovard for three hours until 6:30 p.m when they filed out of the hallway chanting, “Whose university? Our university.”
SCALE members inside did not reach a resolution with administration, claiming that USC officials refused to speak with the students and did not allow them to use a restroom.
“[USC administration] made it clear [they didn’t want to negotiate] by leaving the room and did not return for three hours; they instead decided to wait us out by refusing to allow students to access a restroom,” said one SCALE member to those outside. “When I spoke with someone from DPS, they told me they weren’t sure bathrooms were a health and safety right that we were entitled to.”
SCALE members Lorelei Christie and Julia Wang told the Daily Trojan that during the sit-in, students were threatened with phone calls to parents, revoking of financial aid and suspension.
“[USC administration] did exactly what they’ve been doing to us in the past eight months, which is threaten us and ignore us,” Christie said. “Administration came down and issued a bunch of threats [to] take away our scholarships, suspend us, call our parents.”
During the sit-in, Wang said that Dr. Ainsley Carry, the vice provost of student affairs, had contacted the students directly with the threats.
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Carry clarified that the students were notified they would be suspended if they continued to “disrupt university business,” but no official suspensions were given.
“No letters of interim suspension were handed out … the students were informed that if they chose to continue to disrupt university business with loud protests inside the building or by staying inside the building after the hours of operation that they would be given a letter of interim suspension,” Carry wrote.
Carry also noted that if a student were to be suspended, they “would likely face the loss of any university scholarships.”
The vice provost went on to mention that USC does not work with vendors whose apparel is produced within Bangladesh.
“The standards and requirements of USC licensed vendors are among  the most stringent in higher education,” Carry wrote. “USC has a long history of making dedicated efforts to help ensure that USC-branded merchandise is manufactured under safe and fair working conditions. No USC licensed vendor is producing USC merchandise in Bangladesh … We will continue to require that all licensees producing products for USC manufacture those items only in factories that ensure safe working conditions for their workers.”
During the sit-in, SCALE members held an additional protest outside of Bovard, circling near the front gates chanting slogans such as “USC you can’t keep hiding, we the students are united” and “Hey Nikias prove your creed, don’t give into corporate greed.”
“United we have the power, we have the skill, to bend their will,” said Faiz Jaspar Abu-Jaber, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “We will not take no for an answer until the contract with JanSport has been destroyed.”
Seven DPS cars were parked outside of Bovard by the time the protest began, and DPS officers surrounded the entrance to Nikias office, not permitting access to any students. Additionally, many of the administrators working inside left the building at that time.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle noted that officers were not previously notified of the SCALE protest, and said upon arrival, they kept a steady presence while student affairs talked with SCALE representatives.
“We monitored the situation while Student Affairs dealt with the student representatives from [SCALE] and there was no unfortunate action necessary,“ Carlisle said. “I have to defer to Student Affairs about if there were violations of university policies on campus for failing to move out of Bovard Auditorium.”
Throughout the protest, SCALE members outside Bovard stood up and explained their reasoning for the organization’s presence. Liz Fernandez was one of those members, and beckoned USC to hear the organizations pleas.
“[The SCALE members inside Bovard have] been threatened with suspension and they’ve been told that USC won’t speak to them,” Fernandez said. “To us that’s unacceptable, we’re your students, why won’t you hear our voices?”
Fellow member Ryan Hauck reiterated Fernandez’s sentiments, asserting that administration cannot ignore the organization’s presence.
“Human life is more valuable than however much money [the university] is saving,” Hauck said. “We are here to tell USC you can’t ignore the students without the students coming to you … our voice will never be silenced.”
Following the sit-in, SCALE members declared that they will continue their campaign to end USC relations with JanSport, and hopefully reach a resolution with university administration.
“All we can say is we will be back,” Christie said. “I think we showed them were willing to do whatever it takes to win this campaign.”

The NCAA announced Tuesday that Division I programs will be allowed to give athletes (including walk-on athletes) unlimited meals and snacks, according to a report from ESPN. This change comes partially off the heels of Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier’s comments regarding hunger following his team’s NCAA National Championship victory.
Tense relationship · USC athletic director Pat Haden has criticized the NCAA for its alleged mishandling of USC football’s recent sanctions. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“Sometimes, there’s hungry nights where I’m not able to eat, but I still gotta play up to my capabilities,” Napier told a stunned audience. Napier’s quandary was one shared with quite a few student-athletes in a heavily regulated college athletics landscape. As recently as last year, the NCAA had regulated the distribution of snacks to bagels, nuts and fruits to athletes at any time during the day. A reading of that bylaw, however, prohibited the distribution of cream cheese, and the “bagel law,” as it came to be called, quickly became a symbol for the NCAA’s over-regulation of college athletics.
The bagel law was eventually repealed last year, but as of now the NCAA is facing perhaps the biggest push for the de-regulation of amateur athletics since its inception, so it comes as no surprise to me that it would be willing to loosen up a little bit. Though the allowance of snacks and meals seems like a big step for the NCAA, it fixes something that should have never been regulated in the first place. The fact that the NCAA was regulating which foods players were permitted to put in their bodies is unnerving enough. But to tell these athletes they can’t have cream cheese provided with their bagels? No wonder the NBA Draft seems like the ideal place for most college athletes to spend their would-be sophomore year.
Look, I’m not an NCAA athlete, but if I was unable to afford food and some governing body told me that I wasn’t allowed to eat except for specific periods of the day as prescribed by NCAA bylaws, I might take issue with that. What’s actually the problem here isn’t simply the fact that the NCAA seems to be regulating the very means by which athletes sustain themselves on a day-to-day basis — it’s that the constant gamesmanship on the part of the programs contributes to the NCAA’s need to regulate such seemingly trivial matters so tightly.
In a landscape where competition is the name of the game, it only serves to reason that a coach would seek to gain every single advantage permitted by NCAA law. In a way, it forces coaches and their staffs to become legal eagles on the black letter of the NCAA bylaws in order to gain any implicit or “uncovered” advantage not so stipulated specifically by law. Already the concern with the repeal of the bagel law was that coaches would start grilling steaks and serving them as “bagel toppings” to circumvent the NCAA’s draconian meal scheduling regulations.
But the NCAA seems to be clinging to the vast majority of its existing regulations and the amateur status of its athletes, sometimes for its own sake. There is no reason why a governing body that just received $681 million for its television contract for the men’s basketball tournament alone, according to a report from the Indianapolis Star, should be telling athletes what to do or when to do anything. The fact remains that these are athletes who churn the gears of the NCAA’s massive moneymaking machine. Receiving a scholarship is all well and good, but the stress level of some of these athletes are on par with the scrutiny and attention received by their professional counterparts.
I’m not advocating a complete breakdown of the amateur system — ideal as that might be for someone who attends USC, a college flowing with milk, honey and loyal booster money. I’m just saying that the NCAA should have the judicious council in place to learn the difference between regulating recruiting efforts and potential unfair advantages by the coaches, and legislating and over-regulating actual areas of athletes’ lives where they should have a reasonable expectation of freedom.
Let’s face it, the NCAA isn’t going to start paying its players anytime soon when its student-athletes are guaranteed a scholarship. But the experience of receiving a scholarship is diminished by how intensive sports participation can be. The reality of college basketball is that there is, in fact, a much smaller window of time for scholarship-level athletes to dedicate to their studies and the overall college experience.
To so strictly regulate the use of resources and impose completely asinine, punitive sanctions on those programs that do not comply with already-ridiculous rules is just the name of the game at the NCAA. But here’s to hoping that this lift on food restrictions is the first of a handful of de-regulating measures by the NCAA in response to the current fierce advocacy of the abolishment of the amateur system.

With the postseason just over a week away, the No. 3 USC women’s water polo team (22-1, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) looks to polish off its regular season this afternoon against No. 2 UCLA (22-3, 4-1). A win over the Bruins would complete a perfect regular season at home in the newly renovated Uytengsu Aquatics Center, a good omen for things to come. USC will play host to both the MPSF and NCAA tournaments.
Scoring machine · Junior two-meter Eike Daube’s four goals pushed USC to victory against LMU last week. Daube has 35 goals this season. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy were able to extend the win streak at home last week against a No. 13 Loyola Marymount team that had a difficult time containing the explosive USC offense.
As time wound down in the opening period of play with just four seconds on the clock, junior two-meter Eike Daube slammed in the first of her four goals on the day to erupt the packed crowd. Daube’s goal, in addition to another stellar defensive outing by the entire Cardinal and Gold squad, gave USC a 3-0 lead going into the second quarter.
“As the season progresses and we’re playing with each other more and more, our defense is just going to get stronger,” said senior captain Maddie Rosenthal. “Especially having someone like Flora Bolonyai, who’s an Olympian and arguably the best goalie in collegiate water polo, in the cage — it definitely gives you a lot of confidence on defense. It lets you take a few more risks, knowing that you have such a strong presence in the cage.”
LMU was able to close the gap, using a 6-on-5 powerplay to get on the board, but it wouldn’t take long for the Women of Troy to reassert their dominance. Daube tallied another score, then senior utility Kaleigh Gilchrist followed with one of her own. Co-captain Gilchrist moved into sole possession of No. 12 on USC’s scoring list with the rocket.
The Women of Troy would expand on the scoring frenzy coming out of the halftime intermission. Daube finished off her scoring efforts to increase the advantage to 9-3 before the Lions were able to find the back of the net again.
“I think that in prior games there have been situations where I’ve been hesitant, but after the Stanford and San Jose games, I just had a spark,” said Daube, who has registered nine goals in the past two games. “It just made me want to go for it and not be afraid.”
Heading into the final frame with a 10-4 lead, head coach Jovan Vavic was able to give the starters some much-deserved rest and provide substitutes with invaluable playing time. Junior driver Jennifer Stiefel got things going with back-to-back scorchers that made their way into the cage. Freshman two-meter Avery Peterson capped off the day with a pretty touch that scooted by the outstretched LMU goalie, as the Women of Troy tamed the Lions, 14-5.
As the hungry squad prepares for today’s big matchup, they are not oblivious to the fact that this is not just any other opponent.
“It’s very heated playing UCLA. They’re our crosstown rivals,” Rosenthal said. “I’m not going to say that we like them — after all, it’s UCLA. We are really excited and fired up and looking forward to [the game].”
In the season’s first matchup against the Bruins, USC was able to clinch the UCI Invitational title with a 7-6 victory in its only overtime game this year. Daube led the Women of Troy in scoring, with both goals coming in the extra period to capture the win.
The crosstown rival Bruins enter the matchup coming off a grueling weekend of competition. On Friday evening, the No. 1 Stanford Cardinal eked out a narrow victory, 9-8. The Bruins, however, returned to their winning ways as they took down No. 8 San Jose State at home, 8-6.
“When we played Stanford, we weren’t playing our best water polo. When we play UCLA, we have to play to our potential,” Rosenthal said. “If we’re able to step up and play the type of water polo I know that we are capable of, we should be able to come out with a win.”
Today’s regular season finale tips off at 5:00 p.m. and all coverage can be seen on the Pac-12 Networks.

The ballots are in, the votes have been tabulated and the Trojans’ “quarterback competition” now appears to be over, as head coach Steve Sarkisian finally announced on Tuesday that redshirt junior Cody Kessler will be the starting quarterback for the Trojans in 2014.

As of now, it looks like Kessler, not redshirt freshman Max Browne, will be the one under gun when the Trojans open up the 2014 season against Fresno State on Aug. 30 at the Coliseum.
“If we were starting a game today, Cody would be our starting quarterback,” Sarkisian said. “I think he’s deserved it. I think he’s earned it. I think he’s performed well.”
The incumbent gets the starting job after leading the team to 10 victories and  throwing for 2,698 yards and 20 touchdowns in 2013. Sarkisian asserted that Kessler probably had his best day of spring practice on Tuesday.
He praised Browne’s deep ball, but ultimately felt that Kessler’s leadership was the deciding factor. The decision to tab the Bakersfield, Calif. native is something that former head coach Lane Kiffin was unable to do the second week of the regular season.
“I’m confident we can go out and win a lot of football games with Cody Kessler as our quarterback,” Sarkisian said.
The coach also reserved praise for Kessler’s challengers. “[Browne’s] going to be a star, and [freshman Jalen Greene’s] going to be a great player.”
The experienced Kessler knows the responsibilities that fall on his shoulders by being named the starting quarterback and he made it clear he would keep working.
“It’s not over. This is ’SC,” Kessler said. “It’s always a competition and I’m going to keep pushing myself to continue to get better.”
The first-year head coach also added that Max Browne will continue to compete for the job into the fall and could still unseat Kessler.
“This competition is going to wage on,” Sarkisian said. “Max isn’t just going to go away … When fall camp rolls around, he’s going to come and swing at him again and give Cody his best shot and Cody will either respond like he’s done this spring and continue to get better, or Max will pass him.”
Browne claimed that Sarkisian informed him about his decision about an hour before practice and said that while he was disappointed,  the conversation between him and Sarkisian was positive.
“[Sark] told me that he was excited about the future and what I’m doing and how I’m working,” Browne said.
The former five-star recruit explained how he wasn’t really sure about the timing of things, but was hoping that the quarterback competition would go into the summer.
“It’s a decision he made and I got to respect it, but I thought I made huge strides this spring,” Browne said.
When asked about the possibility of transferring with four years of eligibility still remaining, Browne made his intentions very clear.
“I’m staying put. I’m here for good,” he said.
At last week’s practice, Sarkisian had said that he had moved closer to coming to a final decision that would be announced before the end of spring ball.
Freshman Jalen Greene, who has showed some promise with his speed and versatility this from the pocket this spring, will assume the role of the team’s No. 3 quarterback.
Aside from the quarterbacks, The Trojans entered its final week of spring practice on Tuesday, where they continued their preparation for the annual spring game to be played at the Coliseum on Saturday.
Quick Takes
Former USC players Mitch Mustain, Silas Redd and George Uko attended practice along with four-star wide receiver recruit Trent Irwin.
Thursday’s practice will be closed to the media and public, as Sarkisian continues to install new additions to the playbook for the fall.
Saturday marks the team’s annual spring football game. The game starts at 3 p.m. and tickets will cost 10 dollars. It can also be seen live on the Pac-12 Networks and Pac-12.com.

National Grilled Cheese Day was this past Saturday and once again, I was not being able to enjoy what that beautiful day brought together: bread and cheese. Let’s be real, a girl’s best friend could be diamonds or chocolate. But in reality, I think we all can agree that nothing is better than a fresh, soft artisan, rye bread with melted, aged, sharp New York cheddar cheese — think about that for a second.
Grilled cheese sandwiches are becoming the new cupcake or cronut — as a perfect versatile dish. When I think of grilled cheese, I am reminded that French toast is a similar concept: Old bread used for a better purpose — but you can also create them to be something out of the ordinary.
There are quite a few popular eateries in Los Angeles that have classic grilled cheeses, not to mention the decadent cheesy goodness that leaves your mind running in wild dairy fantasies.
The famed Grilled Cheese Truck — one of Los Angeles’s mobile eateries — serves a mean Cheesy Mac and Rib sandwich, a sandwich that people rave about for days.
To add to the list of fanciful sub hubs, Heywood in Silverlake serves gourmet grilled cheeses, is open till 3 a.m. and also serves gluten-free and vegan options — an obvious reason to make this decadent cheese sandwich palace a place to go to after a long night at the savvy Silverlake bars.
Greenspan’s Grilled Cheese on Melrose Avenue is another place that does not stray from the classic grilled cheese concept of simple bread and cheeses, but they take it to a whole new level inviting in all sorts of sweet and savory breads with an assortment of chutneys and aged dairy product.
LA Weekly’s Squid Ink came up with a “10 Best Grilled Cheese Sandwiches in Los Angeles,” and the amount of cheese and bread is astounding, but so worth it — the number one pick: Local on Sunset. “The 3 Cheese Grilled Brioche Sandwich. A balancing act of childhood whimsy and adult savoir faire,” Squid Ink said. “Served on burnished brioche that is neither too thick nor too thin; the trio of cheddar, jack and swiss cheeses are garnished with subtly tangy oven-roasted tomatoes and a tiny hint of carmelized onion. An additional bonus is the barely sweet, brick-red chipotle ketchup served on the side. Not typical, not necessary, but exceptional. The sandwich comes with lightly dressed mixed greens so you can justify eating the whole thing in one sitting.”
Sounds like a keeper to me.
What makes a great grilled cheese? I believe that it is the chef. Grilled cheese-making is an art form, but you do not have to be a professional to make one — just make sure you know how to use a stove, because otherwise, you’re in deep cheesy goop. To make a great grilled cheese, you have to know what you’re craving.
The grilled cheese is so much more than just a sandwich because eating grilled cheese is a lifestyle. Donut Friend’s owner and visionary, Mark Trombino, told me in an interview that many of the flavors that he used as inspiration for his donuts came from looking at creative grilled cheese recipes, like his most popular donut, the “Jets to Basil,” a glazed donut with goat cheese spread, strawberry jam and basil topped with a balsamic glaze — yes, it is as good as it sounds.
I would like to take a moment to thank the food gods for bequeathing to the world the knowledge and the experience of what it’s like to consume and enjoy a precious, decadent, mouthwatering and savory grilled cheese sandwich. I believe that we should be grateful for the food that is given to us and then devour it wholeheartedly, though a grilled cheese should be eaten with care and devotion because of how immaculate its cheesy qualities are.
I encourage you to eat more grilled cheese. If you are vegan or dairy free, they have alternatives. If you are gluten free, there is gluten-free bread. And if you are a horribly un-American individual who thinks that the simple creation of bread and melted cheese combined isn’t tasty, then you belong in space, but I am sure that even astronauts and aliens would enjoy such a tasty creation.
Here is to ending your day with a grilled cheese. Enjoy!

Many college students shy away from cooking because they perceive it as time-consuming, overly complicated and expensive. With patience and an open mind, however, anyone can create excellent food using simple ingredients.
Brunch for a bunch · These easy to follow, inexpensive recipes for French toast, granola and eggs are a surefire way to impress your friends at an Easter brunch this Sunday, and help you save some money. These recipes were featured on the recipe and travel blog “Let’s Live La Vida.” – Photo courtesy of Lena Tavitian
This Easter brunch menu is affordable and easy to prepare, designed for a festive holiday meal with friends. Even the most inexperienced cook can host this get together for up to 12 people, serving homemade dishes that cost less than a dozen donuts from Spudnuts.
Homemade almond-poppyseed granola is a staple item that exceeds any store-bought variety. The recipe takes five minutes to throw together, utilizing ingredients that most college students already have on hand.
You can get creative with the nuts and seeds, substituting cashews or walnuts for the almonds or adding a handful of dried fruit at the end. You will end up with crunchy, golden clusters of granola, ideal for sprinkling on top of yogurt or snacking on plain.
Baked cinnamon French toast is a standout dish that will leave your friends in awe. By arranging the bread in a single pan, save yourself the time and hassle of flipping each piece individually.
This clever layering method creates a caramelized cinnamon-sugar crust and a gooey, custardy center. You can even assemble it the night before, then bake it in the morning. Topped with maple syrup and fresh berries, this French toast exceeds most versions found in restaurants.
To round out the menu, no Easter brunch would be complete without eggs. Every college student should master this essential technique for soft-scrambled eggs — a simple and satisfying dish appropriate for any meal.
Low heat is the key to achieving delicate, silky-smooth curds. Pouring eggs into a scalding skillet causes them to cook too quickly, yielding a burnt and gummy scramble. Be patient, coaxing the eggs gently and removing them from the heat when they are moist and just set.
Using these fool-proof inexpensive and impressive recipes, any student can replicate a homey Easter celebration in his or her apartment. With food this delicious, however, weekend brunch may become a frequent tradition.
Almond-Poppyseed Granola 
Recipe adapted from Belinda Leong, via Food & Wine: America’s Greatest New Cooks
Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup whole almonds, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose or whole wheat flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon salt
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons honey, warmed
Yields about 4 cups.
Total cost: $2.91
1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the oats with the almonds, flour, brown sugar, poppy seeds and salt. In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the maple syrup, then add this to the oat mixture and stir until the dry ingredients are thoroughly coated. Spread the granola evenly on a prepared baking sheet.
2. Bake the granola in the center of the oven for 10 minutes. Stir the granola, then drizzle the honey evenly over the top. Bake for 20  more minutes, stirring once more, until golden and nearly dry. Remove the granola from the oven and allow it to cool completely on the baking sheet before serving. Serve with yogurt and fresh fruit.
 
Baked Cinnamon French Toast 
Recipe courtesy of The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook
Ingredients:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
16 slices (from a 1-pound or 450 gram loaf) white sandwich bread
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened
3 cups whole or 2% milk
6 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Yields 8-12 servings.
Total cost: $5.56
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a small dish. Line two large baking sheets with foil. Place the bread slices on the baking sheets in one layer. Spread each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon of butter, then sprinkle each slice with one teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Toast the trays of bread in the oven until the bread is golden, and until the cinnamon-sugar makes a caramelized crunch on top, for about 7 to 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and let the toast cool slightly.
2. Generously butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Cut two slices of the cinnamon toast in half horizontally. Arrange the baking dish so that the longer side is horizontal to you on the counter. Place the bottom half of a divided slice of cinnamon toast in the upper left-hand corner, cut side facing left. Arrange the first full slice of toast on top of it, so that the upper crust of the slice meets the left side of the pan. Arrange six more slices across the top of the pan, crusts in the same direction, overlapping each slightly. Finish with the top of a divided slice of toast. Repeat with the second row, toast facing in the opposite direction, starting and finishing with your second divided slice of toast.
3. Whisk the milk, eggs, salt and vanilla in a medium bowl and pour evenly over the cinnamon toast in the baking dish. Let sit for 15 minutes (or overnight, if you’re preparing this ahead of time) so that the custard absorbs.
4. Before baking, sprinkle any leftover cinnamon-sugar over the French toast. Bake for 30 minutes, until puffed and golden and until no liquid seeps out of the toasts when you nudge it in the pan. Cut into squares and serve plain, or with a dollop of yogurt and fresh berries, or maple syrup.
 
Soft-scrambled Eggs 
Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk or cream
1 tablespoon of butter or non-stick cooking spray
Salt and pepper to taste
Yields one serving.
Total cost: $0.30
1. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them with the milk or cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place a small pan on medium-low heat and coat the pan with butter.
2. Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Using a rubber spatula, whisk gently and repeatedly while scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, until eggs are just thickened, creamy and small curds begin to form, 2-4 minutes total. (If mixture begins to stick to pan while cooking, remove from heat; whisk gently for 30 seconds, then continue cooking over heat). Remove from heat and serve immediately.

As basic lunch staples go, perhaps there is no single concept that could be considered the furthest thing from “gourmet” as the humble sandwich — and yet chef Eric Park, one of the minds behind Black Hogg in Silverlake, Calif. as well as its sandwich shop lunch concept, Sopressata, seems intent on bringing yet another sandwich shop to Downtown Los Angeles. The new sandwich spot, aptly named “Hero Shop,” actually serves one very particular style of sandwich: the Vietnamese banh mi.
Hero of the story · Banh mi Vietnamese sandwiches, the main menu item at Hero Shop, are typically filled with beef, chicken or pork, cilantro, daikon, peppers and pickled carrots. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
The Vietnamese food staple is a fusion of colonial French influences and Southeast Asian flavors. A Vietnamese style baguette is sliced lengthways, smeared on one side with pate and stuffed with pork, beef or chicken, cilantro, pickled carrots, daikon and peppers.
Park has made headlines for his bold and complex flavor combinations while at the helm of Black Hogg, an endeavor that has proved rather successful. So the chef, along with his partner Jonathan Kim, weren’t exactly up all night thinking of ways to branch out their brand in Los Angeles — the idea of a banh mi shop came to them naturally, and has actually been in the works for quite some time.
“Banh mi was something I had on the backburner, and we were actually going to bring Sopressata [to Downtown L.A.],” Park said. “We were just talking, and then that eventually became [us] saying we should do something different and open a banh mi concept.”
The shift from Sopressata, which puts out more traditional American-styled sandwiches like turkey and avocado and Italian cold cut sandwiches, to banh mi, was an obvious one for Jonathan Kim.
“A big, chef-driven banh mi shop doesn’t really exist in Downtown,” Kim said. “It’s something I think people will really enjoy, and people who have never tried banh mi will get a chance to try it for the first time.”
Kim’s words ring true, at least in part. Most traditional Vietnamese style banh mi can be found about 30 miles south of Los Angeles in Westminster, Calif. The Orange County suburb is also home to Little Saigon, the single largest Vietnamese community by population outside of Vietnam. It’s there that the banh mi has achieved significant popularity as a cheaper, faster and altogether more palatable alternative to U.S. sub shops like Subway.
The most well known purveyor of banh mi in and around Westminster is Lee’s Sandwiches, a banh mi shop that unfortunately puts the emphasis on its lower prices and not the quality of the sandwiches themselves.
“I’ve eaten Lee’s [Sandwiches] and Banh Mi Che Cali [in Westminster, Calif.]. You always wish you had more — there’s not enough meat,” Park said. “They’re always known to be super cheap so that’s what you get, a sparsely portioned sandwich.”
The banh mi at Hero Shop, however, is anything but sparse. A barbecue pork banh mi comes stuffed with tender, rich and fatty spiced pork, balanced out with daikon relish, diced pickled carrot, whole-leaf cilantro, chili mayo and fish sauce vinaigrette.
One bite reveals a unique experience that distinguishes it from the typical, needle-thin and topping-sparse baguettes from Lee’s. A crunchy, substantive baguette strikes the perfect balance of textures, giving way to the sandwich’s hearty largesse of savory ingredients. The barbecue pork, spiced with notes of ginger and gochujang (red pepper paste), is reminiscent of the Korean dish dwaeji-bulgogi.
The chili mayo and the sliced peppers neatly accentuate the spicy notes, giving the sandwich a manageable kick in the finish that cuts through the pâté and savory pork. Kim is right. There is nothing quite like this banh mi in Los Angeles — or anywhere else, for that matter.
In following this philosophy of thoughtfully employed and well-balanced ingredients is the fatty brisket banh mi, which is in part Park’s take on another Vietnamese food staple, pho, in sandwich form.
“If you go to some good pho places, they’ll have a fatty brisket pho that’s not available everywhere,” Park said. “You get a lot of flavor from the fat, and I wanted to transfer that flavor to a sandwich. We’re marinating it in a lot of Vietnamese spices, including a Vietnamese five spice that we put on the brisket.”
Similar to the barbecued pork, the brisket is melt-in-your-mouth tender. The crunchiness of the bread is vital here for textural balance. There are no pickled vegetables here to detract from the mellow, fatty beef brisket. Instead, fragrant notes of coriander and a familiar heat from the chili mayo and jalapeno reinforce the beef.
Aside from the sandwiches, Hero Shop plans on offering rice bowls and salads based on ingredients used for the banh mi. Which brings up another point: Hero Shop is still in soft open, with its grand opening planned in the very near future. In the meantime, though, Hero Shop seems well on its way to making its mark in a very busy Downtown L.A. lunch scene.
 
Hero Shop is located at 130 E 6th Street in Downtown Los Angeles. The Shop is open from 10:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. from Tuesday through Saturday.

From protests on college campuses in the 1960s to vigils in response to the wave of violence in the 21st century, the student voice regarding issues that matter has always made a statement. During emotionally charged moments in our country, students and their movements have commanded the attention of adults and have swayed political decisions. A recent decision by the school board of the Los Angeles Unified School District will bring the student voice back to the forefront of the conversation surrounding education policy in the city.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
On April 8, LAUSD voted to allow a student advisory member on the board, according to the Los Angeles Times. The position would be an elected one, and despite the student not being a voting member, he or she would be able to make suggestions on important issues and cast an advisory vote just before the official vote is taken. Though a bold move on the part of the LAUSD school board, it is a decision that has been long-coming. The California State Education Code, which was approved in 1976, stipulated that the board has at least one non-voting student member. Throughout the years, they have inconsistently abided by this rule, according to an April 7 report by the L.A. Times. But in recent years, logistical and funding issues swayed the school board to disregard this provision.
Regardless, it is critical to have this student voice at the table. Other large school districts have already implemented this structure. The Portland Public School system annually chooses a student representative to serve on the board and though his or her vote doesn’t count, he or she is treated as other active board members are and addressed with the title of student director. Here at USC, the senators of Undergraduate Student Government voted to have a student sit in on board discussions regarding tuition and other important topics that affect student life on campus. By respecting the student representative in this way, the board can go a long way in representing the rest of the 640,000 students in the nation’s second-largest school district.
Furthermore, with a student at school board meetings, the goals that LAUSD has outlined can be achieved more swiftly and efficiently. Among the district’s five outlined goals are more engagement with parents and the community, as well as 100 percent attendance and graduation. Many believe these goals are more likely to be reached now that a student is required to sit on the board and encouraged to share his or her input. Students are the ones directly affected by the policies and decisions that the board makes.
As this decision is implemented, Superintendent John Deasy will have 120 days to determine how exactly the student member will be figured into the school board and also the extent of his or her responsibilities, CBS Los Angeles reported. Though the student representative is not able to vote, his or her responsibilities should not be diminished. Instead, the student representative should concentrate on developing the skills to be an advisor.
Students are the perfect springboard for adults to share and receive feedback on the ideas and plans they seek to implement in the public school system. For example, take the iPad rollout, which was marred with technological difficulties and security breaches. These problems possibly could have been foreseen by students who recognize that teenagers like them are prone to using technology for non-academic reasons. If there was a student voice at these meetings, backup plans possibly could have been put in place to prevent the iPad rollout from ballooning into a national conversation on poor planning in the state’s public school system.
When I was in high school, my classmates and I didn’t have the opportunity to contribute to the conversation with our Board of Education. Yet if maintained and properly structured, these future students in Los Angeles will be the benefactors to a transformational dynamic between the power structures of the public school system.
We should all be mindful of the positive impact this could have on our public school systems as a whole.
By selecting a student to sit on the board, they are elevating the importance of student involvement in education and providing an equal seat at the table for all players involved in K-12 education in Los Angeles.

Dear President C. L. Max Nikias,
Last year, USC faculty and students came together to call on our university to affiliate with the Worker Rights Consortium, the only independent factory monitor in the nation. This was an important first step, and since our affiliation last summer, the locations of Trojan apparel production and detailed reports on the conditions of the relevant factories have been made available to the public via workersrights.org. This step has also given USC the ability to learn more about the brands we do business with — brands like JanSport, whose parent company VF Corporation produces apparel in sweatshop deathtraps. The WRC has provided USC with concrete information regarding the failings of JanSport/VF in their report on Optimum Fashions factory.
The report notes “the inspection uncovered a number of very serious safety hazards at Optimum Fashion, all of which constitute violations of university code of conduct provisions requiring licensees to maintain safe workplaces and any of which could result in injury or death to workers. The violations of greatest concern involve inadequate means for workers to escape the factory in the event of a fire and structural flaws that would facilitate the rapid and widespread propagation of deadly smoke throughout the factory building.”
The lack of adequate means of escaping fires is especially important in light of the fact that in 2010, 29 workers were killed in a factory fire in Bangladesh where VF apparel was being produced. As a result of a disregard for fire safety standards, workers were trapped and could not escape. Despite these events, a 2013 safety assessment of another VF factory revealed serious structural flaws and an alarming lack of appropriate fire exits. In the face of this tragedy, and in light of the fact that 1,500 workers have died in the past two years alone in preventable factory disasters across Bangladesh, VF still refuses to take responsibility and protect the lives of its workers.
JanSport is a part of VF Corporation, and while JanSport has claimed autonomy from its parent company, the truth is that VF directly controls sourcing, operations and safety standards for JanSport factories. According to VF’s 10-K disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all VF apparel, for JanSport and their other brands, comes though the same sourcing hubs. Further, JanSport’s own website admits that its global compliance standards are “through our parent Company, VF Corp,” and that it has no worker safety program or initiatives independent of VF.
We the faculty therefore join with concerned students to request that our university cut its contract with JanSport/VF unless the company signs onto the Accord for Fire and Building Safety and is held legally accountable for the safety of its workers. We believe that this is both vital and urgent, and we hope that USC will take responsibility and enact these changes immediately.
Fight On for a sweatshop-free university!

Since its inception, the advertising industry has tried to present ads as entertainment, and it’s never been closer to succeeding.
Although Americans watch less live television today than we have in the past, TV ads have started to become more a part of pop culture than ever before. With online viewing platforms allowing us to circumvent traditional ads, viewers have started watching  the most compelling ads for fun.
Social media has enabled friends to share ads with one another, allowing the spots that achieve viral status to garner tens of millions of YouTube views. It’s no surprise, then, that 2013 was the first year in which the advertising industry made more money from online content than broadcast TV, according to CNET.
There has been a wide variety of viral ads since the dawn of the social media age, with most of them falling into four basic categories:
1. The unbearably cute, personified by Budweiser’s “Puppy Love,” which debuted during the Superbowl
2. The absurd or hilarious, personified by Pepsi Max’s “Test Drive.”
3. The heart-throb, personified by “Giving” a spot for a Thai mobile phone company that US consumers will never interact with, despite its viral popularity.
4. The social statement/critique, personified by Chipotle’s “The Scarecrow” and Dove’s “Real Beauty Sketches.”

The final category is by far the most sophisticated and compelling type of ad in the viral landscape. People do not share these ads because they are entertaining, but because they are revelatory and inspiring, which may very well translate to entertainment for the most socially conscious among us.
In the back of our minds we know the ultimate goal of these ads is to sell a product, yet we still watch them by the millions and allow them inspire us despite these intentions. Social consciousness has officially been commodified. Rather than representing the ever expanding scope of the advertising industry, however, this development says more about the state of our pop-culture, which clearly does not adequately address the issues we care about.
All of the aforementioned ads are not only similar in terms of their viral notoriety; they are also similar in their length, production values and use of titles and storylines. Although it might initially seem like a foolish question, the informed viewer is forced to ask, “Are these advertisements or short films?”
For the first three categories of viral internet ads, the designation of short film seems a bit generous. But as these ads increase in sophistication and in the perceived social significance of their content, it becomes easier to view them as standalone films. Not to mention the fact that they tend not to mention the product they’re selling until the final five or so seconds. Doesn’t the viral, anonymous informational (albeit highly political) film “Wealth Inequality in America” fit in relatively well with the Dove or Chipotle ads?
But now it’s 2014, and we’re already starting to look beyond advertisements as short films — we’ve officially entered the era of feature films as ads. Heather Havrilesky suggests that The Lego Movie has seriously upped the ante in the race for most affecting and entertaining advertisement in a March article in New York Times Magazine, “The Brilliant, Unnerving Meta-Marketing of The Lego Movie.”
The film’s critical and nuanced commentary on the present nature of consumerism hits the viewer like cold water to the face, simply because of the fact that it’s a kid’s movie.
Havrilesky makes this realization all the more astonishing by pointing out that the film as an advertisement uses the same subliminal and self-critical marketing techniques that it depicts on screen, saying that, the film “is hyper-aware of its own fictionality and this earns the right to simultaneously denigrate and elevate itself as divine.”
Perhaps Dove and Chipotle could stand to be more aware of the fictionality of their own campaigns. Maybe the best thing to do in the increasingly complex world of advertising is to emulate Lego’s childlike appreciation for the logical and ethical layers within its own marketing campaigns.
