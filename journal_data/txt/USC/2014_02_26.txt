On Wednesday afternoon, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs at USC organized a screening of the film An Ordinary Hero in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom.
Heroics · The panelists discussed Mulholland’s role throughout the Civil Rights Movement during the event which took place Wednesday night. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The film focuses on Joan Mulholland, a civil rights activist, and her Civil Rights Movement involvement. The reception, screening and Q&A session aimed to engage students in a discussion about activism based upon Mulholland’s accomplishments.
Mulholland was raised in the American South during a time of extreme racial prejudice and segregation. After hearing a group of black youths speak about their justification and efforts for equality, she felt a responsibility to use her position to change the Southern way of life. From that point on, Mulholland said she seized every opportunity to join the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement despite the challenges and dangers they presented.
These opportunities included her participation in the Freedom Rides and her enrollment in a historically black university, Tougaloo College in Mississippi. She also became the first white member of the historically black philanthropy-based sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. Her most prominent and recognized act, however, was her involvement in the Woolworth sit-in in Jackson, Miss.
What began as a peaceful protest turned violent when the crowd began throwing food and harassing the protesters. Someone in the crowd suddenly grabbed Mulholland by the hair and violently dragged her toward the exit as law enforcement officials watched. In a moment of courage, she escaped and made her way back to the counter despite the evident danger.
USC students in attendance at the event were intrigued and impressed by Mulholland’s story.
“I [found] Mulholland’s story to be truly inspiring and [it] is one that more USC students should be knowledgeable about,” said Nadia Fallahi, a freshman majoring in public relations. “It is important to apply her message about activism to issues in the surrounding community.”
During the Q&A portion of the event, Mulholland was also joined by three Freedom Riders to share their own experiences. Guest Robert Singleton described his experiences in the city and county jails for his participation in the Civil Rights Movement.
Members of the local chapters of Delta Sigma Theta also attended the screening to support their fellow sister and ask questions.
One woman asked about the message Mulholland was trying to impart. In response, Mulholland said, “I hope y’all get the message that almost anybody can make a difference. I hope for this film to get used as an educational tool and to inspire young folks that they can go out and do something.”
The women also questioned how to better engage kids who seem numb to the civil rights struggle. Mulholland suggested getting the young people involved with an issue directly related to them so they will be able to connect with and appreciate the past.
In closing, Mulholland shared her wisdom with the USC community.
“The message is that you don’t have to be a big name to do it,” Mulholland said. “You can just be you and make a change … Focus your energy and change the world.”

In a recently published paper in the Journal of Brain Pathology, USC psychologist Margaret Gatz and a team of international experts compared the brains of twins where one or both died of Alzheimer’s disease.
The study, which was funded by research grants from the National Institute of Health, found that Alzheimer’s progressed similarly in the twin pairs, and they both had similar areas of brain damage.
“We try to make inferences based on tests and diagnoses, but we have to assume that what we’re seeing is a manifestation of what’s going on in these twins’ brains,” said Gatz, a professor of psychology, gerontology and preventive medicine in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, in a press release. “For this reason, we wanted to compare the brains of twins to ask whether identical twins’ brains are actually more identical.”
Over the past 30 years, Gatz has worked with the Swedish twin registry and studied more than 14,000 Swedish twins. For this particular research, scientists autopsied the brains of seven pairs of twins who had previously undergone diagnostic evaluations for Alzheimer’s disease.
“Identical twins tended to have similar combinations of pathologies. We looked not just at the hallmark indicators of Alzheimer’s, but at all the other damage in the brain. Across the whole array of neuropathological changes, the identical twins appeared to have more similar pathologies,” Gatz said in a press release. “This is fascinating: It’s not just a key pathology related to the twins’ diagnoses, but the combination of things happening in their brains. We’re going to keep looking for what these combinations are.”
An autopsy remains the only definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s, and though the presence of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain are considered hallmarks of the disease, this new study suggests the presence of other factors in the brain could contribute to the start of the disease.
“There may be risk factors that start to accumulate, but don’t lead to a clinical diagnosis,” lead author Diego Iacono of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Biomedical Research Institute said in the press release. “We found that the presence of Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t preclude the presence of other damage.”

Undergraduate Student Government hosted a think tank discussion for student leaders in different organizations across campus to collaborate on pressing issues that students are facing on and off campus.
The Think SC event encouraged students to raise questions and offer solutions to four of the more fundamental topics for students at USC: Greek life and its social policies, wellness, sexual assault and sustainability. USG student body president Christian Kurth moderated the evening’s event, posing a series of questions that dealt with each major topic and searched for strategies to solve the controversies surrounding these topics.
“It’s a think tank, so [it’s] an open dialogue for all presidents and representatives of their organizations,” said Giovanni Navarrete, president of the Lambda Upsilon Lambda, a Latino fraternity. “It’s sort of just [to] come up with ideas and help create a better USC environment, better programming, a better way to connect amongst each           other — you know, network, so that’s what I’m here for.”
One topic that was discussed during the event was the prevailing wall between Greeks and non-Greeks at USC, focusing on ways that the student body and their surrounding organizations can bridge the gap between the two.
Sophomore Rini Sampath,      USG co-director of external relations, online editor of the Daily Trojan and                                                                vice president-elect, believes that philanthropies and the abundance of talent within the Greek system could serve a bigger goal to bring more people together from all over campus in various kinds of events.
“I see Greek life as large pockets of really talented, intelligent [and] driven people who, I think, if we utilize that space, we can really do some amazing [things],” Sampath said.
USC student leaders then shifted to a discussion on sexual assault. Kurth encouraged students to brainstorm ideas on how to improve resources for sexual assault victims and methods to encourage a change in the culture of this issue. Many students agreed that alcohol was a predominant part of the sexual assault culture at USC, but they also encouraged forums and talks with students about sexual assault and the fine lines that might be overlooked or ignored.
Sampath hoped that the evening’s discussion would foster an environment for students to mix together ideas and shed light on any topics that came to mind for the different leaders.
“I think that we had such a diverse group of students this year,” she said. “It was a great mix and everyone was saying things that I never even thought about, and that’s what the purpose of the event was, to have different opinions come out — and we achieved that.”
Sampath hopes to provide USC students more opportunities to engage in think tank-related discussions.
“One promise that we are making is we want to have an event like this every month of the year, [a] town hall [or]                forum-style discussion, where students outside of USG are able to give us feedback where we can make real change,” she said.
The students raised support for the evening discussion and hoped that these events continue to be a method for people to come together and share ideas.
“I think that this is a good idea. I wish there were more before,” said Loranna Grigoryan, president of the Pre-Pharmacy Society.

Former USC football head coach and current head coach of the reigning Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks Pete Carroll came to the Bovard Auditorium Wednesday evening to discuss his “Win Forever/Always Compete” high-performance mindset and how his personal philosophy could be applied in business and in life.

The discussion was hosted by the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business and moderated by the center’s  co-director and adjunct professor David Belasco. Carroll’s appearance comes roughly two weeks after his daughter, Jaime Davern, and Seahawks team psychologist Michael Gervais led a classroom of USC MBA students in a daylong seminar about Carroll’s secrets to success.
Carroll, who won two national championships in his time at USC, started by speaking about his earlier experiences as a coach in the NFL, particularly in regard to his time as a head coach of the New York Jets and the New England Patriots. Carroll recalled a time when he was in the office of former Jets general manager Dick Steinberg. Jets owner Leon Hess was in the office, and Carroll had just come off a 6-10 season.
“I walk into Dick Steinberg’s office … and I sit down, shake hands, and [Hess says], ‘Pete, a man in your position in the business world would resign. But I know you’re not going to do that … so you’re fired,’” Carroll said. “I said, ‘This is the most amazing that’s ever happened to me … I’m going to Disney World!’”
That type of optimism was the underlying message of the event, where Carroll preached about the importance of bouncing back from adversity and maintaining a positive attitude in the face of enormous pressure.
Carroll also analogized the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory to USC’s 2004 national title win over the Oklahoma Sooners: Both Carroll teams arrived to their respective title games with a surreal amount of composure. Carroll chalked up his success in both games to ample preparation and an intense focus on the matter at hand.
Students walked away with quotable anecdotes and inspirational aphorisms. George Andrews, a junior majoring in chemistry and accounting, was particularly inspired by Carroll’s message of giving one’s best effort, regardless of circumstances.
“My biggest [takeaway was] one word: grit,” Andrews said. “One of the examples he used was if you have a job to do, you’re going to be paid $2 but give it a  $3 effort- — you’re going to go above and beyond whatever your call to duty is.”
Things took a turn for the unexpected when Carroll was explaining the story of a particular Trojan receiver. As Carroll recounted the story of a certain receiver’s lack of athleticism in an attempt to catch a Matt Leinart pass during one of the Trojans’ practices, Anchorman star Will Ferrell identified himself in the story and made a surprise appearance at Bovard Auditorium to re-enact, and defend, his poor pass-catching skills. The entrance of Ferrell drew raucous applause from the capacity crowd at Bovard.
Current USC football head coach Steve Sarkisian also made an appearance. Carroll praised his former quarterbacks coach for his “mental agility” and revealed that Sarkisian had received his full endorsement prior to his departure.
“I tried to get the administration to guarantee [Sarkisian] would be the next coach if I was leaving,” Carroll said.
Carroll closed his presentation with words of encouragement for the students. Laura Coholan, a senior majoring in political science, was particularly struck by Carroll’s delivery.
“At the last minute, he gave an inspirational talk to everyone,” Coholan said. “You really felt like he was talking to you as though he was talking to a player on his team.”
In a press conference that immediately followed the event, Carroll took time to address the issue of the NCAA sanctions that affected USC. Carroll was outspoken in his criticism of the NCAA sanctions.
“We made some mistakes along the way, but I never felt like [the sanctions were] dealt with properly,” Carroll said. “I felt like it was dealt with very poorly, very rashly and done way too much with emotions instead of facts. Unfortunately, the kids who played in the program after the fact were the ones who got held down.”
When asked if he would have done anything differently, Carroll expressed regret at the lack of knowledge of the NCAA’s intentions, saying he would have been open to fixing issues in the program if the NCAA had intended such.
“We just didn’t know what was going on. Had we known, I think we would have fixed it and did the right thing,” Carroll said. “I sat in the meetings, I heard the people talk, I listened to them talk about our program. They didn’t understand a thing about what we were about. They never wanted to hear it.”
In addition to the NCAA’s unwillingness to take a rehabilitative approach to programs facing scrutiny, Carroll was critical of the NCAA’s punitive approach, saying that the NCAA’s investigation was philosophically flawed and wrongly focused on punishing entire programs for the actions of a handful of individuals.
“The philosophical approach from the NCAA is about punishing a school,” Carroll said. “It’s people who cause these problems, it’s people who have nothing to do with the university and the direction and the focus [of the NCAA] is that, ‘well we can’t do anything about that, so let’s just punish the school.’”
Carroll’s departure from USC was marked with allegations that he took his current post as head coach of the Seattle Seahawks in an effort to avoid facing NCAA sanctions. But Carroll’s return to Bovard Auditorium suggested a different tone: The audience’s chants of “We love Pete,” the arrival of comedian Will Ferrell and USC’s “Fanfare” played by the Trojan Marching Band ensured that Carroll will be a lifelong Trojan.
Great article about a great man. The university is proud of our Pete Carroll.
He is much more than just a great football coach and super bowl champion.
Always Fight ON !!!!

With all of the hype surrounding USC baseball’s hot start to the 2014 season — wait, what? Hype surrounding USC baseball? The team that’s had a .470 winning percentage in the last decade (and .407 in the last three years)?
Yes, as has been seemingly well-documented, the USC baseball team is off to a thrilling 7-1 start, with four walk-off wins to its name — three coming in extra innings. My esteemed colleague Nick Selbe gave you all the details on Tuesday regarding the team’s early successes, so I’m here to step back and give a bigger-picture look.
First, a cautionary tale: The 2012 USC baseball team started the season 7-0 and 12-3, climbing its way into the national rankings for the first time since 2007. That hot start included two consecutive home sweeps to open the season and a home win against a powerful Cal State Fullerton squad, all of which the Trojans have also accomplished this year.
That 2012 team ended up 23-32, going 11-29 the rest of the way with an incredibly dismal 1-15 stretch to finish the season.
Nothing was expected from that 2012 team, however, and their hot start was ultimately more surprising than their 10th-place finish in conference play that year.
But this 2014 team is supposed to be different. Not that they are supposed to end up in Omaha, but the consensus seems to be that the Trojan baseball team will experience its first winning season in nine years. A collapse akin to 2012 would indeed be shocking.
But why? What is different about this 2014 team, whose weekend rotation is exactly the same as 2013’s and whose starting lineup features six or seven of the same players as last year’s, which was technically the worst team USC has put on the field in close to 30 years?
I harp on that a lot, much to the annoyance of many, I’m sure. But it simply underscores how dramatic a turnaround is expected of the USC baseball program this year. On paper, the only difference is that last year’s freshmen are this year’s sophomores with a mere season of collegiate experience under their belt.
But the 2013 Trojans were not as bad as their record indicates. Twelve (that’s a full third) of their losses came by just one or two runs. I cannot possibly recall how many times the Trojans hung with a team that was probably more talented for seven or eight innings before finally succumbing, or how many games they could have won with just one timely hit.
In 2013, the Trojans developed a sense of resiliency that I had not seen in my previous two years covering other bad USC teams. But games aren’t won based on desire, and the fact of the matter was that USC couldn’t come through in the clutch.
But so far this year, the Trojans are getting those timely hits. Sure, it took them 11 innings in their first game of the season and 15 in their second, but the Trojans are doing what they failed to do throughout the 2013 campaign. The resiliency that emerged last year is back, and this time it is generating results.
Last Friday, USC scored two runs in the eighth inning and two in the ninth for a 4-3 win over North Dakota State. On Sunday, they completed a sweep of the Bison by scoring two to tie the game in the eighth and then won in the bottom of the 12th after surrendering a run in the top of the frame.
That can’t happen every game, of course, and on Tuesday USC suffered its first loss of the season to Long Beach State in a tight 2-1 game.
Still, the 7-1 start to USC’s 2014 campaign is obviously promising.
In 2012, the Trojans visited No. 6 North Carolina after a 7-1 start to their season, and they dropped the first two games before salvaging a win on Sunday.
This weekend, weather permitting, the Trojans will host the No. 17 Cal Poly Mustangs at Dedeaux Field. It’s still early, but we are going to find out soon how different these 2014 Trojans really are.

“We want to get back on court and play,” USC head coach Peter Smith said. “We’ve got to be able to stand up for ourselves.”
The Toreros (3-3), who are ranked No. 62 in the nation, will also be looking to get back on the right track after suffering a narrow 4-3 defeat at the hands of No. 33 South Carolina last Sunday.
Clarke Spinosa is USD’s only ranked player in singles, sitting at No. 61 in the nation. Meanwhile, USC will bring four ranked players into the matchup: senior captain Ray Sarmiento (No. 6) and juniors Yannick Hanfmann (No. 10), Jonny Wang (No. 43) and Roberto Quiroz (No. 80).
Spinosa leads the way for the Toreros in doubles as well. He and doubles partner Filip Vittek are ranked No. 30 in the nation together, while USC’s Sarmiento and Hanfmann sit at No. 12.
Around this time last year, USC took it to the Toreros in San Diego. The Trojans dialed up a 6-1 victory at USD. USC faced off against USD again later in the season, where the Trojans took down the Toreros 4-1 in the second round of the NCAA tournament. USD earned its sole point in the match when Spinosa upset Sarmiento by a score of 0-6, 6-1, 6-1.
The Trojans hope to extend their winning streak against USD today, and a win over the Toreros would be especially sweet considering the connection between the two schools: USD head coach Brett Masi.
Masi served as the Trojans’ assistant coach from 2005-2009, when he helped the team win its first of four consecutive national championships.
“He’s probably one of the closest people to me in my life, and I love him,” Smith said of Masi. “He’s like a brother. [I] just want to kick his butt, bad.”
Following the match against USD, the Trojans will compete at the historic Pacific Coast Doubles Championship at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. The tournament second-longest running tournament in the United States, starting in 1890.
This tournament is open to people of all ages, not just college tennis players, and doesn’t count toward the Trojans’ wins and losses. This, and the fact that just a few steps away from the courts is the pristine beach and beautiful Pacific Ocean, creates a laid-back atmosphere — a welcome break from the normal stress of being the most successful team in the history of college tennis.
“I think the tournament relaxes us, which makes us last longer in the regular season,” Wang said.
Though the atmosphere might be low-pressure, the tournament still represents an opportunity to scout some Pac-12 teams, as players representing UCLA, Stanford and Cal, among other schools, will be competing.
The Trojans might even get a chance for a rematch with some Bruins at some point in the tournament. Last year, USC’s then-sophomore Eric Johnson and then-freshman Max de Vroome advanced to the finals of the tournament, where they faced UCLA’s Marcos Giron and Dennis Novikov. The Trojan duo was playing together for the first time all season, but put up a fight against the talented Bruin pair, eventually falling 7-6 (6), 3-6, 4-6.
Sarmiento, the Trojans’ top player, will not compete in the tournament, as he received a qualifying wild card spot at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. Despite his absence, the Trojans are looking for a win today and for a deep run in the tournament.
The forecast calls for rain all weekend, but the Trojans are determined to make the best of the situation and enjoy the break from the stress of competition.
Today’s match against the Toreros begins at 2 p.m., and the doubles tournament runs today through Sunday.

The No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team extended its winning streak to four games after sweeping unranked Cal Baptist 25-22, 25-21,  25-22. The Trojans improve to 10-5 overall and 9-5 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play.
Dagger · Freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh delivered the match-winning kill for the Trojans. Benesh is second on the team with 114 kills this season and is one of two players to have started all 14 matches for USC. – Benjamin Dunn | Daily Trojan
The Trojans quickly took an early 6-3 lead with a kills by sophomore middle blocker Tommy Leonard, junior setter Micah Christenson and freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder. The Trojans advanced their lead to 11-6 after two more kills from Yoder and one from Leonard, respectively. The Lancers pulled within two points after two consecutive aces  to make the score 12-10 in USC’s favor.
Kills from freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh, senior opposite hitter Tanner Jansen and Yoder brought the score to 19-16 in USC’s favor, though the Lancers’ defense kept the gap from widening. Another kill by Jansen and one from senior opposite outside hitter Maddison McKibben lifted the Trojans to a 22-18 lead. A service error by the Lancers set up game point for the Trojans and a kill by Yoder ended the first set 25-22 in the Trojans’ favor.
The Lancers led the second set 6-3 and eventually converted that to a 10-6 advantage thanks to their defense. Kills from Leonard, Christenson, Benesh and Yoder brought the score to a 16-11 Lancer advantage, and a block by Christenson closed the gap to 16-12.
“We didn’t serve well at all in the second set,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. “Cal Baptist picked up their game, and we fell off ours. We made a ton of errors that hurt us.”
Three consecutive kills by Yoder followed to bring USC within one point. An ace by Yoder and errors by both sides tied the game at 19 apiece. Two consecutive kills by McKibbin gave the Trojans a 21-20 lead, and an error by the Lancers brought the score to 22-20 in USC’s favor. A yellow card against Cal Baptist further shifted the momentum, and finally another kill by McKibbin and an error by the Lancers ended the second set 25-21 in a USC victory.
“Andy really stepped up for us in the second set,” Ferguson said. “That yellow card really woke our team up and gave us the extra motivation to win that set. It was the perfect storm.”
The third set began with both sides splitting each point, though finally two consecutive kills from Yoder gave the Trojans a 6-4 lead. Kills by Benesh and Yoder kept the Trojans ahead, despite offensive errors from their teammates. Cal Baptist’s defense tied the game at 8-8, and two kills by Leonard and one from Jansen put the Trojans back on top, though errors by the Trojans allowed the Lancers to tie the game at 14.
Again, both sides split the points back and forth until finally a kill by the Lancers and an error by the Trojans gave Cal Baptist an 18-16 edge over USC. Kills by Yoder and Jansen tied the game at 18, though a kill by the Lancers and a USC error again gave the Lancers a two-point advantage, bringing the score to 20-18. A kill from Jansen and an error by the Lancers tied the game at 21. A block by Leonard gave the Trojans a 23-22 lead, and a kill by Benesh ended the match at 25-22 for a Trojan victory.
“Our blocking and serving got better as the game went on,” Ferguson said. “Our blocking was our best run at the end and it’s what really did it for us.”
USC travels to Provo, Utah tomorrow to face the BYU Cougars, who beat the Trojans 3-2 earlier this month, in an MPSF match at 7 p.m.
“Last match we had spurts of brilliance, but at times we fell flat,” Ferguson said. “We have to play at a high level all the way through the match against BYU.”

The Maestros, a USC Advanced Games Project, hopes to simplify and make accessible the real-time strategy game, a genre dominated by “hardcore” games such as League of Legends or Defense of the Ancients. The game will be shown at the Game Developers Conference, a global games convention and a rare feat for USC projects. An online alpha test of the game will be available for download the week after spring break, and a beta will be released by May 14.
The Maestros began as a project for Global Game Jam, a worldwide game developing challenge. After reworking the concept, a pitch was selected for USC’s Advanced Games Class, which produces only six to eight games per year. This, coupled with the passion of its developers, has led to a fun take on a classic genre.
“Growing up as a kid, I was really into strategy games, and I had a really hard time getting people to love these games like … Starcraft or Warcraft III,” said team lead Andrew Erridge, a senior majoring in computer science (games). “I wanted to make a game in the same genre that was simple enough for my dad to play and not get confused.”
Erridge contrasted this ease of play to the competitive atmosphere of League of Legends and Starcraft, the two most popular RTS games. Erridge felt the issue with those games was the pacing, where the first 30 minutes of play session is dedicated to amassing resources in order to build troops. The Maestros remedies this issue through the concept of transformation. Rather than having an in-game currency to create units, basic units called “Dough Boys” can be transformed into more complex units over the course of a game. Transformation pads dot the map, and finding one allows for the creation of new units.
Another concept unique to the genre is the lack of base building. More units are amassed through killing neutral units on the maps, rather than through finding resources, like in Starcraft.
Lead designer James Corcoran, a senior majoring in computer science (games), believes the game stills needs to be balanced, but that by May 14, a redesign will have fixed the pacing.
“The vision for the game was that we create a competitive multiplayer teams-based, real-time strategy experience which didn’t play like a typical real-time strategy game,” Corcoran said. “A lot of them, such as Starcraft, have a longer ramp-up time. There’s a time in which we need to gather minerals and build bases. Everything is very mobile in this game. The action is present almost always. It feels a lot like a shooter, and that’s exactly what we want.”
This shooter-like pacing comes through. Playing a build of the game from December that consisted of only one map and one player race, matches took less than 10 minutes. The lack of ramp-up time and small map sizes created tense action, as players could go on the offensive immediately. The distribution of transformation pads and neutral units allows for immediate combat.
Unlike other RTS games, this one lacks a single player campaign mode, a staple of the genre since Warcraft III. A small lore, telling the story of the two playable races, has been developed. The story details two playable races, the steampunk Teutonians and the alchemy-inspired Regalis, and their discovery of an island ripe for colonization. This theme of imperialism works well in the RTS, and it’s really a shame that there is no campaign to develop it.
The detailed art assets, however, paint a narrative through the Teutonian’s metallic character designs. Lead art designer Brian “Panda” Choi, who graduated from the Interactive Media division last May, cites the visual influence of both Warcraft III and games in the “illustrated realism” style, a mix of painted characters and realistic materials.
This art design comes from a variety of artists worldwide. Min Htet, a senior majoring in business administration and the game’s producer, said he believes that this benefits the game.
“On The Maestros team we have a number of artists from places as diverse as New Zealand, England and Germany,” Htet said. “This is a truly international project that has never been seen before in a student game, at least here at USC. Here at USC, we don’t have a dedicated game art program at the Roski School [of Fine Arts]. [Due to this], a lot of people look to other schools around the world to contribute to the game externally.”

With the 86th Academy Awards only three days away, the Best Picture race has seemingly narrowed to a three-way duel between Alfonso Cuarón’s immersive sci-fi spectacle Gravity, Steve McQueen’s soul-searing historical drama 12 Years A Slave and David O. Russell’s flashy crime caper American Hustle. No matter which film ultimately triumphs, two things are already certain: 1) Despite a slow start, 2013 was a pretty fantastic year at the movies and 2) This Sunday’s ceremony — hosted by Ellen DeGeneres as a calming antidote to Seth MacFarlane’s mammary-centric antics last year — will be one of the most unpredictable in recent memory.
Gravity of the situation · Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, starring Academy Award winners Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as a pair of astronauts stranded in space, has been nominated for a total of 10 Oscars, including Best Visual Effects, Best Actress and Best Picture. – Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures
 
This dead heat has been in the forecast for a while now. Last month, the Directors Guild of America honored Cuarón with its top prize — The DGA Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in a Feature Film — while the powerhouse cast of American Hustle dominated the Screen Actors Guild Awards. The Producers Guild of America — usually the most reliable bellwether for the Oscars — just couldn’t choose between 12 Years A Slave and Gravity, leading to the first tie in the show’s 25-year history. The Golden Globes, meanwhile, clumsily attempted to spread the love by awarding American Hustle Best Comedy or Musical, declaring Cuarón Best Director and bestowing 12 Years A Slave with its one and only award of the night: Best Drama.
So who’s actually going home with the little gold guy? Let’s consider each movie’s individual merits, along with some possible drawbacks.
Gravity is a nerve-rattling, eye-popping marvel that never allows its bleeding-edge special effects to outshine its two human stars. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are both at their finest as two astronauts navigating oblivion, but Bullock’s character in particular quickly becomes the heart and soul of the film, transforming a relatively straightforward lost-in-space thriller into a powerful metaphor for the grieving process. It’s entirely possible, however, that some Academy members might only see the film as a technical showcase — it’s definitely a lock for Best Visual Effects. If McQueen and his crew end up winning Best Picture, it’s a good bet that Cuarón will score Best Director as a hefty consolation prize.
12 Years A Slave, the presumed favorite, is without a doubt the most unflinching examination of human bondage ever put to film. Unlike the gleeful blood-and-irony revisionism of Django Unchained, McQueen’s film offers no easy catharsis for the inhuman evil that is slavery. Instead, it dives headlong into the casual brutality of our nation’s original sin, plucking the stitches from old wounds and testing its audience’s tolerance for scenes of abject cruelty and debasement. Even though the movie is ultimately a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit, its grueling bouts of violence — especially that agonizing lynching scene — could alienate more sensitive voters.
Then there’s American Hustle, a haphazard epic of pros and cons that’s deeply indebted to early Scorsese and the small army of costume designers and stylists who created the film’s over-the-top hairstyles, wardrobes and the Byzantine wonder that is Christian Bale’s faux comb-over. Russell’s film, his third straight critical and commercial hit in what many are calling a creative renaissance, has a zippy, delirious energy all its own. But there’s been a backlash brewing ever since it received 10 Academy Award nominations, tying Gravity and outpacing 12 Years A Slave.
To be perfectly honest, American Hustle doesn’t belong in the Best Picture race. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad movie. It’s a fun, light-hearted romp with a talented cast that’s clearly having a ball trying on outlandish costumes while spouting over-the-top dialogue in often-undeterminable accents. The scene in which Jennifer Lawrence’s tempestuous New Jersey housewife character starts a kitchen fire because she can’t understand how to operate her new “science oven” (i.e. microwave) was one of the funniest moments in theaters last year, second only to the Quaalude overdose scene in The Wolf of Wall Street. But at the end of the day, Russell’s narrative is just too rambling and convoluted for its own good. That said, if 12 Years A Slave and Gravity end up splitting the vote, this scrappy underdog with the loud wardrobe and the impeccable perm could pull off a come-from-behind victory, thus joining the ignominious ranks of past “undeserving” Oscar winners such as Shakespeare in Love and Dances With Wolves.
The acting categories are a bit easier to predict. Cate Blanchett’s mesmerizing turn as a gloriously unhinged ex-trophy wife in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine makes her winning Best Actress the safest bet of the night. Though 12 Years A Slave’s Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nebraska’s Bruce Dern were once considered the two presumptive frontrunners for Best Actor, Dallas Buyers Club star Matthew McConaughey seems to have the most momentum right now. The critical acclaim surrounding his portrayal of a homophobic AIDS patient-turned-pharmaceutical smuggler is only the latest triumph in the actor’s post-Lincoln Lawyer career resurgence, a three-year winning streak that’s evidently continuing on the small screen with HBO’s new procedural, True Detective.
Best Supporting Actor is often the villain’s corner -— past winners include Heath Ledger for The Dark Knight and Javier Bardem for No Country for Old Men — or a platform for honoring older actors who are still taking chances. This year, however, the category likely belongs to 30 Seconds to Mars frontman Jared Leto. The musician/actor, who’s appeared in Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream and the underrated Lord of War, gives a revelatory performance in Dallas Buyers Club as Rayon, a transgender AIDS sufferer whose mordant sense of humor masks a crippling drug habit. Like his co-star McConaughey, the already slight Leto dropped an alarming amount of weight to realistically portray someone on death’s door. Yet the physical transformation is only part of what makes Rayon such a compelling character. Leto brings a certain world-weary charm to the role, infusing every line of dialogue with a sad, knowing wisdom that transcends stereotyping.
Best Supporting Actress will inevitably come down to Jennifer Lawrence in American Hustle and relative newcomer Lupita Nyong’o, who plays the demanding part of Patsey in 12 Years A Slave. In a film chock full of danger and dire circumstances, Patsey has it worse than anyone. She’s a field slave caught in the middle of a domestic dispute between sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps (Best Supporting Actor nominee Michael Fassbender) and his equally nasty wife, played with icy furor by Sarah Paulson from FX’s American Horror Story. Epps wants to use Patsey as his sexual plaything, while the missus sees the hardworking cotton picker as a threat and plots to have her beaten to death in order to regain her husband’s twisted affections. The scene in which Patsey begs Solomon Northup (Ejiofor) to help her commit suicide is arguably the most heartbreaking sequence in the movie, and in a film as harrowing as 12 Years A Slave, that’s really saying something. Besides, as enjoyable as Lawrence’s performance in American Hustle is, the Hunger Games star won an Oscar just last year for Silver Linings Playbook. Now it’s Nyong’o’s turn.
The Academy Awards have always been Hollywood’s biggest night and an enduring institution of pop culture, even during times when the contenders were average and the outcomes were obvious. This year, however, with so many phenomenal films in contention and so many nail-biting races to follow, there’s really no excuse not to tune in. And if your own predictions don’t turn out so well, take solace in the wisdom of former perennial Oscar host Bob Hope: “Personally, I never drink on Oscar nights, as it interferes with my suffering.”

Regional American cuisine seems to be di rigueur as of late, with the popularity of Midwest and Southern-style barbecue eateries such as Horse Thief BBQ and Bludso’s Bar-&-Que, and the opening of Whiz, an upscale Philly cheesesteak-pub concept in Koreatown, to serve as examples. The latest entry into the L.A. food scene isn’t so much a new take on these regional foods, but rather the transplantation of a tried-and-true recipe: Chicago’s very own Budacki’s Drive In, which comes to Los Angeles in the form of Budacki’s Hot Dog. Los Angeles’ version of the 52-year-old Chicago hot dog stand is currently in soft open in new digs in the old Pizza Rustica space in Exposition Park.
Dog eat dog world · Chicago-based Budacki’s Drive In takes Los Angeles by storm with its new restaurant, Budacki’s Hot Dog. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
The name Budacki’s might ring a bell to Chicagoans or fans of Anthony Bourdain. In 2012, the controversial chef and star of CNN’s Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown once threatened via Twitter to cancel his visit to Budacki’s Drive-In in Chicago as a result of the restaurant publicly announcing his arrival with a $1 hot dog special. Of course, Bourdain eventually made it to the North Side eatery for a “stealth shoot.” But, thanks to the efforts of restaurateur Jin Ra, it’s the drive-in’s West Coast offshoot that’s been on the radar of curious passersby and hungry museum patrons as of late.
Upon walking into Budacki’s Hot Dog, it becomes clear the restaurant is playing to the Trojan crowd: Workers are outfitted in full cardinal uniforms and USC hats, and the restaurant’s space is completely decked out in cardinal and gold — or ketchup and mustard, your pick. Save for its puzzling choice of polished cherry wood furniture, it has every making of a local hangout for catching Trojan sporting events on one of the restaurant’s two flat-screen TVs. Those watching the USC men’s basketball team this season will be disappointed to find that Budacki’s doesn’t serve hard alcohol. Budacki’s does, however, serve a handful of domestic and imported beers, which is excellent given that they pair well with the food.
The Chicago Dog is actually a very finicky hot dog. It begins with the frankfurter, which isn’t the ideal variety with natural casing, but is still a cut above the average Hebrew National or Ballpark variety nonetheless. This hot dog is topped with veggie toppings, including diced onions, tomatoes, pickles and sport peppers. The entire dog is then sprinkled with celery salt and served on a bun with a pile of French fries. At first bite, the Chicago Dog just makes sense: The salty, rich frank is undercut with a clean, acidic bite from the pickle and a pleasant amount of heat from the sport peppers. Chicago dog purists might be dissuaded by the absence of a poppy seed bun, and Budacki’s bun seems almost like an afterthought when considering the other ingredients.
Another Chicago favorite that made it to the West Coast is the Italian beef sandwich — thinly slivered, slow-roasted sirloin steeped in a gravy infused with Italian spices is piled onto a roll and topped with spicy giardiniera, or pickled carrots and peppers. Budacki’s version is served on ethereally soft bread, which sounds great in theory. In practice, however, the gravy and juices of the meat overwhelm the bread. Sure enough, as soon as the sandwich felt the slightest bit of pressure from the outside, the bread was rendered in twain at the hinge. This slip-up was at least partially rectified by how solid the sandwich actually tasted. The beefiness did, however, overwhelm the slightly underrepresented vinegary twang of the giardiniera — Budacki’s would do well to pile on more of the pickled vegetables and peppers to really allow both flavors to play against one another.
Which brings everyone to the most important point: Spicy, greasy foods pair incredibly well with beer. It’s as simple a fact as there is in food, and Budacki’s has several beers by the bottle, including Fat Tire and Heineken.
The most important factors in driving Budacki’s business, however, will boil down to two things: location and price. The aforementioned combination of a Chicago hot dog and Italian beef sandwich, with a helping of very crunchy and delicious French fries and a soda, costs exactly $8. It’s a godsend in a neighborhood that seems to offer everything except unpretentious, down-home American fast food (feel free to cast BUILT Burger and Pizza Studio a dirty look).
Budacki’s caters to a “turnt-down” crowd that could use a good old-fashioned hot dog, sandwich or burger and a beer with ESPN on the tube. And with the dearth of solid hangout options for those types in the immediate proximity of campus, Budacki’s Hot Dog in Exposition Park might just carve out a following for itself — no Anthony Bourdain-fueled publicity stunt required.

President Barack Obama is about to join Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Lord Auckland and Leonid Brezhnev in a very exclusive club that only adds a new member every few decades: world leaders who have tried and failed to successfully invade and reshape Afghanistan, referred to in the history books as “the graveyard of empires.”
The Obama Administration announced Tuesday that it is planning a full withdrawal from Afghanistan, to be completed by the end of 2014, according to the Washington Post. The plans were made necessary by the failure thus far of negotiations between President Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai over the Bilateral Security Agreement, the last hope for securing U.S. presence in the country past the end of this year.
Negotiations began to unravel last November. Though the Loya Jirga, a gathering of 2,500 Afghan elders, endorsed the signing of the BSA, Karzai balked when a U.S. drone killed several civilians last November. Karzai has since expressed a laundry list of preconditions for his signature, ranging from the end of drone strikes to a mandate for direct peace talks with the Taliban.
Whatever happens in the negotiations, Karzai’s objections speak to deeper problems in the American war machine. These problems make it not only impossible to negotiate with Afghanistan, but also directly hamper allied cooperation in the future. Rather than the short-term tunnel vision that has dominated the U.S. approach to Afghanistan and the War on Terror, a more pragmatic approach consistent with international norms is our only hope for the future of engagement with the international order.
The U.S. should commit to full resolution of the indefinite detention of detainees both at Guantanamo Bay and abroad. This is something that President Obama promised during his candidacy and has since failed to do. One of the sticking points over signature of the BSA is the continued detention of Afghan citizens at Guantanamo. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act gives the government the power to begin transfers abroad, but still bans any funds for transfer to the United States for trial or imprisonment, leaving many in Guantanamo for the foreseeable future.
Guantanamo Bay and detention abroad in general have come to be seen by allies as the most egregious characteristic of post-9/11 policy. The Germans may have raised temporary hell over the tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone, but you can bet her data plan that they took much more seriously the alleged torture of Turk Murat Kurnaz, a German national.
Even if the war in Afghanistan is winding down, can the U.S. really afford to leave the precedent set by the last 13 years of detention on the books? The next time the U.S. war machine finds itself abroad, it would do well to have a precedent against the kind of indefinite detention that still exists today.
Furthermore, even if negotiations with Karzai fail, the U.S. will get another shot when the country’s next leader takes power after the April elections. But it is naïve and shortsighted to think that these issues are specific to Afghanistan alone. U.S. allies have turned a blind eye to the aforementioned practices for long enough, and the trend is beginning to grow unsustainable.
The challenges of the 21st century — be they climate change, global proliferation of nuclear weapons or collapsing regimes and rogue states — will require close collaboration with our allies abroad. That cooperation will be less effective if our preferred means of overcoming these problems are hampered by our inconsistent and hypocritical military industrial complex.

It is quite simple, but our Presidents, either out of zeal or idealism, fail to apply this rule:
Do not invade a hostile country unless you can confidently foresee a plausible good ending, or unless you plan to occupy in force as long as is necessary to stop the return of a virulent enemy government.
Worked in Germany and Japan starting in 1945, and in So. Korea in 1954. Presidents Johnson, Bush and Obama didn’t follow the above rule, though, leading to long, bloody, bitter, expensive and futile wars in Vietnam, Iraq and now Afghanistan.
I think that the lesson learned is that President Obama did not learn from history. 
The lesson we should have learned by now is that our Representatives should follow the US Constitution  –  war should only be declared by a vote of Congress, not the whim of a president and small group of advisers.

Increasingly over the past few years, films about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have made their way from the war-torn region to Hollywood. This year, however, there’s a notable precedent — for though the Palestinian territories are yet to be recognized as a state by the United Nations, Palestine already has an Oscar nomination to its name.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
Omar, directed by acclaimed Palestinian director Hany Abu-Assad, was nominated for Best Picture in a Foreign Language Film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making it the first time a nominated film has had Palestine listed as its country of origin, according to Al Jazeera. The bold step on the part of the Academy to recognize Abu-Assad’s work as a Palestinian film rightly attests to the growing social and cultural legitimacy of the Palestinian people.
The film, set against the backdrop of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, follows its young protagonist, Omar, as he struggles under the pressure to work as an informant for the Israeli authorities. Receiving an overall rating of 90 percent “fresh” from Rotten Tomatoes, Omar is the second Palestinian film to be nominated in the best foreign language category. The first, Paradise Now, was listed as being from the Palestinian territories.
Though Omar managed to get the attention of the Academy, past works in the Palestinian film industry haven’t been as lucky. Palestinian director Elia Suleiman’s 2003 film Divine Intervention was not considered by the Academy selection committee because the Palestinian territories, despite enjoying U.N. observer status and recognition by more than 115 countries at the time, was not formally recognized as a sovereign nation by the U.N. That changed, however, with the U.N. General Assembly’s 2012 recognition of Palestine as a non-member state, paving the way for the Academy to recognize Omar in time for this year’s Oscars.
Such recognition has been a long time coming. When Abu-Assad’s first Oscar-nominated film, Paradise Now, was being considered, it was controversially labeled as being from the “Palestinian Territories” due to the fact that Abu-Assad, despite identifying as a Palestinian, holds Israeli and Belgian citizenship. Last year’s Oscar-nominated documentary 5 Broken Cameras faced similar controversy about whether it should be identified as an Israeli or Palestinian film during the 2013 Oscars as it was co-directed by both Israeli filmmaker Guy Davidi and Palestinian filmmaker Emad Burnat.
This nomination, however, is more than just recognition of a nearly 50-year-old military occupation. It’s also about a people who, despite the daily struggle of living under occupation, manage to create art that can tell their stories. Just as the film’s protagonist Omar struggles under the everyday life of having limited movement due to the security checkpoints both within Israel proper and between it and the Palestinian territories, the filmmakers faced similar travel restrictions while filming.
“When you are under occupation, it is dominating your life whether you like it or not,” Abu-Assad told Al Jazeera. “It’s part of your life. If you want to make a film in Palestine, you can’t avoid the occupation.”
The national identity of a film can be abstract, especially when it comes to contested land such as the Palestinian territories. Yet the recognition of Palestine by the Academy goes to make an important statement to both the film industry and the world. Much in the same way Palestinians crowded the streets in celebration when Gaza-born Mohammed Assaf claimed the title of Arab Idol’s first Palestinian winner, this nomination goes to affirm the legitimacy of the Palestinian people, both socially and culturally. As a nation readily associated with occupation and conflict, this move by the Academy to lend validity to the Palestinian film industry is a step in the right direction.
 
Yasmeen Serhan is a sophomore majoring in international relations. She is also the Editorial Director of the Daily Trojan. 
 
Palestine IS a non-member State of the United Nations. It is the State of Palestine. Dear God when will people do some research before making ridiculous comments.
First off, hat-tip to Yasmeen for such her thoughtful and well-articulated piece. For those whom have misjudged her intentions as malign in any way, I sincerely emplorw you to give it a second read, wary of any implicit bias you may bring to the reading table. 
Secondly, there is one clarification I would like to make, given my fear that those in opposition to this article have begun conflating words, reaching farflung conclusions. 
Being Pro-Israeli and Pro-Palestinian are not mutually exclusive positions. Any qualms as to this possibility is likely to generate misplaced outrage; and is just that– misplaced. 
Yasmeens celebration of triumphant Palestinian filmmaking accredited to ‘Palestine’ has little to not direct bearing bearing on her ability to hold the same sentiments about Israeli filmmaking, or the Israeli state for that matter.
We don’t live in a bubble, though, and any reference to Palestine or Israel comes with certain assumptions that vary depending on one’s vantage point. However, we create more of an “other” than there need be, or in reality is. 
We are amidst negotiations to create the same type of recognition Yasmeen champions. If one has a problem with that, I suggest it be taken up with Mr. Kerry and the  State Department; lest one realize that they are really are a proponent of the very same thing. 
Cheers y’all.
The reason that the UN has not recognized Palestine as a State is because Israel and the US won’t let them. On several attempts, US pressure has stopped the UN from recognizing Palestine. On, the other hand, Israel gained its statehood by this very same UN recognition that they say is an inappropriate vehicle for the recognition of Palestine, of course, because it would legitimize Palestine, the one thing Israel cannot accept, at least until there is no more Palestine.
 Once again, your obvious slanting of the news/facts leads one to think that you are no more than an agent of AIPAC, which of course you are.
You really should resign. You have no integrity. I truly believe that you would spy for Israel against the US if they asked you to and you were in a position to do so. After all, there are more Israeli spys in US jails than Chinese and Russian put together. 
Here’s to the end-of-year Saban/Aipac conference in Washington and hoping you continue the abusive tradition of your former colleague Ms. Sax, and take the trophy for most effective purveyor of Israeli propaganda in a US university. All Heil Hillel!
Yasmeen Serhan is a palestinian. Your comment makes literally 0 sense. She didn’t talk about why Palestine isn’t recognized as a state, because it was irellevent to her article. She obviously WANTS palestine to be recognized as a state, as she clearly explains in the title. What are you even talking about?
Israel should also withdraw immediately from the United Nations (whose full name seems more accurately to be UNAI, the United Nations Against Israel) and help found a robust league of democracies, a new body where human rights violators don’t preside over human rights councils and where blocs of Islamists and communists don’t dictate to progressive republics. The UN might have arguably been the greatest endeavor man ever embarked upon; instead, it is a tiresome farce run by malevolent circus clowns. This is one club to which the Jew, and the Jewish State, should not belong and not wish to belong.
