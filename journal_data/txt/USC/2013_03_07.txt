Associate Professor of Public Relations Jay Wang was named the new director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Wednesday.
Wang, who has worked as a consultant in international corporate communication and public diplomacy, will replace journalism professor Philip Seib, who has held the position of director since 2009.
In a statement to USC News, Wang said he will work to strengthen the center’s role in global politics and make the website into a comprehensive resource on public diplomacy.
The center was created in 2003 to further the study and practice of global public diplomacy through research, publication programs, public events and professional training. It was established through a partnership between the Annenberg School and the School of International Relations at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
Wang will assume the position August.

An innovative cybersecurity program established in fall 2003 has grown exponentially.
The Viterbi School of Engineering’s master’s degree program for computer science with a specialization in computer security, which was established to help combat the growing threat of cyber attacks, is one of the country’s first programs focused on producing specialists in protecting and defending information and information systems.
Cyber threat · In 2003, USC was designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In spring 2008, four students graduated and increased to five students in the spring of 2012. Currently,  17 students are enrolled in the program.
The program has proven essential in building a cyber workforce that has recently been lacking in numbers and earned the university a designation as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Research by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.
Director of the USC Center for Computer Systems Security Clifford Neuman said the concentration teaches students how to keep information safe from hackers.
“There is a need for extra focus on not just how to make the system work, but how to make the systems work in a more adversarial environment, which is what the Internet has become,” Neuman said.
The program not only teaches students about the importance of cyber security through topics such as intrusion detection and ethical hacking, but it also provides students the necessary skills to become penetration testers and security engineers, among other roles.
Many students have already benefited from the innovative program. Hardik Ruparel, a graduate student in the computer science masters program, emphasized the importance of security on the World Wide Web.
“You cannot get away with not knowing about security,” Ruparel said. “It is fundamental in all aspects of computer science.
Anand Narayanan, a doctorate candidate in computer science in the computer security program, said that the program has real world applciations that is becoming increasingly more important.
“It is hard to establish a secret over the Internet,” Narayanan said. “It is not your friend and cannot always be trusted.”
For example, in building an application, the user’s data is the responsibility of the person building it. However, any app on the Internet is vulnerable to be exploited.”
The program is also offered to students nationwide through the university’s Distance Education Network, which allows students to work for corporations and other technology-oriented organizations that pay the student’s tuition.
Vijaya Pillai, a software engineer at Cisco who took the class through DEN last fall, said the program fit into her schedule well.
“The course opened me up to a lot of different aspects of security, such as different security devices, firewall and encryption,” Pillai said. “Learning the course through DEN was very convenient — I could ask the professors questions in real time by just calling in.”
The university’s Information Sciences Institute is also the headquarters to the Cyber-Defense Technology Experimental Research Laboratory Testbed, known as DETER. The on-campus facility, funded by the Department of Homeland Security, specializes in cybersecurity experimentation and testing. A sealed-off “mini-Internet,” created in 2004, allows for safe experimentation in security issues and enables users to conduct Internet simulation experiments in malicious code and a wide range of other network security issues.
Several students said the DETER lab is essential for hands-on education. Many graduates have gone on to work in companies such as Qualcomm, McAfee, Microsoft, Cisco and Symantec. Others students have gone on to work as IT consultants or develop security products.
“We got to simulate the whole environment and write real-world exploits and write safeguards against them,” Ruparel said. “The labs made me a better programmer.”

The new Merle Norman Sand Volleyball Stadium was dedicated  Thursday in front of a crowd of athletes, students and members of the athletic department.
The stadium was named after Merle Norman, the founder of Merle Norman cosmetics and the aunt of alumnus Jack Nethercutt, who spoke at the ceremony.
“We help women look and feel the best that they can, and I think that it’s fitting that we contribute for women’s athletic teams where women can shine,” Nethercutt said.

Students, athletes, parents and donors all gathered for the ribbon cutting ceremony of the three-court volleyball stadium and watched the stadium’s first match between alumna and Olympic silver medalists April Ross and Jennifer Kessy.
Prior to the construction of the stadium, the volleyball team had to commute to the Annenberg Community Beach house in Santa Monica for their practices. Captain Kirby Burnham said that having the stadium on campus will make it much more convenient for the team and that he hopes that it will help the budding sport gain more attention on campus.
“We are in a prime location between the McKay Center and the Galen Center,” Burnham said. “Hopefully, we will be able to build a bigger fan base and our fellow students will come out and support us.”
The team’s coach, Anna Collier, said that the new stadium is fitting for the newest women’s team.
“Sand volleyball is an emerging new sport, so we are lucky that we get a new stadium that’s not just remodeled or revamped,” Collier said. “Its opening reaffirms our commitment to our women athletes.”
Though women’s sand volleyball isn’t recognized by the NCAA, the organization sponsors it as an emerging sport. Ten more women’s sand volleyball college teams are needed to reach the 40-team NCAA requirement to hold a natonal championship.
Steve Nam, a freshman majoring in electrical engineering, came to watch the Olympic athletes compete and taste some of the free food offered by food truck Pie n’ Burger. Nam said the new stadium on campus fits in well with the student body.
“A lot of people here at the school play volleyball, so I think that it will be really nice if the student body gets to use it,” Nam said.
Though Manrique Gomez, a senior double majoring in political science and cinematic arts, has never been to a beach volleyball game, she said that would change after seeing the stadium.
“I feel like beach volleyball isn’t really recognized at the college level and bringing in this stadium might take it one step further to being recognized by the NCAA,” Gomez said.
Some students said the new stadium represented the university’s commitment to growing its athletic program.
Nicole Ludena, a freshman majoring in civil engineering who played with the Trojan Marching Band during the opening ceremony, stayed after her performance to enjoy the game.
“I  love sand volleyball, so I am glad that this is now here in the school,” Ludena said. “I think that it will continue making our school stand out among other universities.”
The women’s sand volleyball team will break in the new stadium in their season-opening competition against Florida State and Loyola Marymount on Sunday.
Bro, that’s the team back on the stage.  No wonder we suck!
Good thing we ave a picture of some guy talking and not, y’know, the new volleyball court.

In a unanimous vote, the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors approved on Wednesday the addition of 150 new hospital beds to the Los Angeles County and USC Medical Center Campus, located in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles.
After its opening in 2008, the state-of-the-art medical center has faced serious overcrowding issues. An insufficient number of hospital beds has caused daily backups in the hospital’s emergency room, with some patients forced to wait in hallways in order to make room for incoming traumas, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Dr. Mitch Katz, head of the Los Angeles Department of Health Services, said that current solutions to overcrowding issues have been insufficient thus far. Katz also said the issue is time sensitive, with federal health care reform laws set to take effect in 2014.
Current overcrowding has caused a diversion of ambulances from the emergency department as well as patient overflow transfers to other hospitals.
L.A. County Supervisor Gloria Molina has been the biggest proponent of the expansion, arguing that the average wait time of 12 hours has caused emergency rooms to become dangerously overcrowded.
“Patients shouldn’t have to wait hours for basic health care,” Molina told the L.A. Times.
The hospital, which was built to replace an aging general hospital tower, has only 600 beds — 224 fewer beds than the hospital it replaced.
The overcrowded medical center currently operates at a reported 95 percent of its capacity, which is higher than industry standards and recommendations, according to the L.A. Times.
Molina said the increase in hospital beds will ease the burden of overcrowding on the medical staff.
“LAC+USC hospital staff are local heroes every single day,” Molina told the L.A. Times. “Even with the constraints of a 600-bed hospital, they’ve done their jobs for years with tremendous compassion and unyielding efficiency. With a 750-bed hospital, LAC+USC staff will have all the tools and resources needed to best provide patients with top quality care.”
L.A. County currently operates the largest health care public-private partnership network in the nation, according to the L.A. Times. It has  one in 10 L.A. County residents an estimated using the system.
Molina said the approval of her motion is part of a new effort to transform the county’s health department from a provider of last resort to a provider of choice, according to Santa Clarita Valley News.
“Los Angeles County will be much more competitive,” Molina told the L.A. Times.
Molina said financing for the construction of a facility that will hold the new beds could cost $300 million to $450 million and will come from the sale of bonds.
This article is incorrect. The Board met on Tuesday, not Wednesday.
They approved a study regarding adding beds to LAC+USCMC. The study may cost as much as $500,000.  The study will review the entire situation and make recommendations as to the number of beds needed.  The study will likely take a year.
Wow, it will only cost half a million dollars to figure out what everybody already knows?  Good thing it’s taxpayer money on the hook.

USC baseball’s trip through the scheduling gauntlet continues this weekend as they get set to take on three different, ranked teams.
The Trojans will host No. 14 Oklahoma Friday night, No. 26 Notre Dame on Saturday and then visit No. 17 UCLA on Sunday, all this coming off a Wednesday game against No. 13 Cal State Fullerton. That’s four straight games against ranked teams for the Trojans (6-6) — not exactly what they need as they head into the weekend, hurt in both pride and body.
For the pride part, the Trojans have allowed 25 runs in the last two games, a pair of embarrassing losses to Fullerton on Wednesday and Fresno State last Sunday.
“These last two games have been pretty rough,” junior pitcher Bobby Wheatley said. “But, that’s why you play so many [games]. We’re not anticipating this to continue.”
The Trojans have fallen into holes of 14-0 and 8-0 the last two games, with anemic starting pitching followed up by equally disappointing bullpen performances. Freshman Kyle Twomey, who will throw Sunday against the Bruins, failed to get out of the first inning last Sunday in Fresno, exiting after two-thirds of an inning and five runs. The Trojan bullpen proceeded to give up eight runs over the next four innings.
On Wednesday against Fullerton, freshman Brent Wheatley was chased after 1 1/3 innings and six earned runs, with the bullpen giving up three runs over the next 2 2/3 innings before settling down the rest of the way.
“Out of 12 starts [this year] we’ve had 10 good ones,” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said of his pitching this year. “Unfortunately, we’re going to look back on these last two and say we’ve had two really bad ones. And, we’re not excited about getting whacked a couple of times.”
It doesn’t help that the injury bug has bitten the Trojans in the last week. Sophomore first baseman Dante Flores will have surgery on his hamate bone and miss at least six weeks. The same injury has sidelined sophomore center fielder Omar Cotto Lozada all season so far. Hubbs said he hopes Lozada will be back within a month.
Last Friday in Fresno, senior second baseman Adam Landecker strained his hamstring and has yet to play since. He is officially day-to-day, but Hubbs expects to have him in the lineup on Friday night. Sophomore pitcher Wyatt Strahan was scratched from his scheduled start last Saturday with shoulder stiffness. His status for this Saturday is “promising,” Hubbs said.
On Sunday, sophomore catcher Garrett Stubbs suffered a concussion in a collision at home plate. He appears to be recovering well, but Hubbs said he really doesn’t know when Stubbs will be available to return, as is often the case with concussions.
“When you lose guys like Flores, Cotto [and] Landecker, it’s really rough,” junior third baseman Kevin Swick said. “We’re a young team and to have inexperienced freshman in there — they gotta pick it up and I think they will —it’s still tough.”
What’s further ailed the Trojans this year is their difficulty hitting with runners in scoring position. USC has stranded a combined 30 runners on base in the last three games, including twice with runners on second and third and once with the bases loaded on Wednesday.
“It’s one thing to get hits with nobody on and two outs,” Hubbs said. “Someone’s got to get hits -— the team won’t hit .000 for the year. But, you have to be able to change your approach and wait for your pitch and, when it comes, put a good swing on it and not try to do too much with that pitch.”
Bad things happen to bad teams, and here it is happening again to the Trojans with injuries. A lot will be
determined with the three game series over the weekend. Confidence boosted or heads down in the dump.

Everything about the first football practice of spring this Tuesday seemed a little bit different.
No one was wearing No. 7 for the first time in what seems like an eternity. Gone were all four team captains from last season. In their wake was a brand new crop of players wearing unfamiliar numbers, playing roles we’ve never seen them play. The field had a new saying on it this season: “Don’t talk about it. Be about it.”
Not to mention Tuesday’s practice was dark, cloudy and freezing. I swear, every practice I went to last year was sunny. Things just didn’t feel right.
But, perhaps that’s the best thing that could happen to the 2013 Trojans: Complete change.
Junior linebacker Hayes Pullard said something that really struck me after practice.
“We’re not going to focus on the past,” he said about the defense’s issues last season. “We can’t focus on 2012. We have to focus on 2013 now.”
It would be easy to get caught up in last year’s 7-6 disaster of a campaign. The “could haves,” the “should haves,” and, of course, the “would haves.” There were meltdowns, turnovers and close losses that should have never happened.
But there’s no trace of those memories on the practice field. It’s a completely clean slate. Even the characters have changed. Last season, the theme might have been “prep not hype,” but the hype seemed to get to the team. A No. 1 preseason ranking, Sports Illustrated covers and ESPN coverage will do that to a team. It’s normal.
There is none of that this year, and that seems to have loosened up the team. They looked genuinely happy to be out there.
Even head coach Lane Kiffin smiled at reporters. He gave thoughtful answers and didn’t seem to be in a huge rush. As the media approached him, there was no look of dread.
He looked happy. I can’t say that was the case last year.
Yes, there’s no Matt Barkley or T.J. McDonald. Instead, there’s a Max Wittek/Max Browne/Cody Kessler and Josh Shaw. Different? Absolutely. Bad? Definitely not.
The Trojans need a new look, anyway, and they need a new face of the program. Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee will serve as that face in 2013. Other than that, though, there are a lot of names that didn’t come up a whole lot last season. Nelson Agholor. Morgan Breslin. Leonard Williams. They’re names every Trojan fan knows, but they certainly aren’t of the star caliber that Barkley and Robert Woods were.
But in not having such star power — in not having the expectations and the weight of the world on their shoulders — USC football players look ready for the challenge of the upcoming season. They aren’t watching everything they say, nor are they afraid of being scrutinized for every single thing they say or do.
With less media attention and expectations, there’s room for these 18- to 22-year-old kids to be themselves. As much as we think they’re professionals, they aren’t. They’re college students trying to deal with college student things. The Trojans were uptight last year — they couldn’t really be themselves. It was evident at every press conference, at every practice and during every single game.
Worst of all, they didn’t look like they were having fun, which is a shame, because college football is one of the most fun things to be a part of.
Now, for the first time in more than a year, the Trojans can relax. A relaxed atmosphere was evident Tuesday and it probably will be for the foreseeable future. It’s a welcome sight. Pullard was right: 2012 is done. 2013 is a completely new adventure.

The teams traded jabs for most of the night, but the Washington Huskies landed a haymaker late in the second half to defeat the USC men’s basketball team, 65-57, in Seattle on Wednesday. The Trojans (14-16, 9-8 Pac-12) led or were tied with the Huskies for a majority of the game, but a nearly seven minute-long scoring drought — from the 12:32 mark to the 5:43 mark in the second half  after junior forward Dewayne Dedmon checked out with his fourth foul — ended up tilting the contest in the Huskies’ favor.
Shooting struggles · Senior point guard Jio Fontan (above) was 2-of-10 from the floor in USC’s loss against the Washington Huskies. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After missing their first five free throws, an area they’ve struggled with all season, the Huskies made their last 17, preventing any sort of late run by the Trojans.
“I don’t know what it was,” senior point guard Jio Fontan said. “Once they got to the free-throw line, they started to knock them down every time.”
Though the Trojans’ defense held the Huskies to just 36.1 percent shooting, USC’s offense wasn’t much better, shooting just 37.5 percent. Neither team held much of an advantage in any statistical category, except for one: The Huskies dominated the glass. Washington had 19 offensive rebounds and controlled the boards 48-29, which proved costly for the Trojans.
“There were a lot of long rebounds and they did a great job getting the basketball, which gave them extra possessions,” USC inteirm head coach Bob Cantu said. “We held them at 36 percent from the field, but we weren’t able to get stops at the right time and they were able to open up the game, which I thought was a big part.”
Dedmon was the one force for whom the Huskies had no answer. He tied his career-high with 18 points (9-of-11 shooting), most of which came off put-back dunks and impressive hook shots. Junior guard J.T. Terrell had 16 points, including going 8-of-9 from the charity stripe.
Fontan struggled with his right hand injury (shooting 2-of-10) but served as the Trojans’ key facilitator, racking up seven assists and creating many high-percentage looks.
“It was real tough,” Fontan said. “I couldn’t really shoot the ball, and I couldn’t drive to my right. They did a good job of catching on to it in the second half and they made adjustments.”
The turning point of the game was when Dedmon sat out after picking up his fourth foul. The Trojans’ offense began to stall, and the Huskies used a 13-2 run to turn a two-point deficit into a seven-point lead. After that, there wasn’t much hope for USC.
Washington senior guard Scott Suggs led the Huskies with 18 points and nailed a 3-pointer off a double screen on an out-of-bounds play to give the Huskies a decisive 48-41 lead with 6:09 remaining.
Redshirt freshman forward Jernard Jarreau also chipped in a career-high 12 points off the bench. There was one bright spot for USC: junior guard C.J. Wilcox was held in check, scoring just 11 points on  2-of-9 shooting.
“I thought we played well, but to win on the road and to win at Washington, you have to play a lot better,” Cantu said.
The loss is very disappointing for a few reasons besides another ‘L’ in the standings.
First, the Trojans handled the Huskies at the Galen Center on        Feb. 10 with relative ease, winning 71-60 behind a dominant first half. For whatever reason, USC just couldn’t replicate its success from a month earlier.
Second, the loss all but ensured that USC won’t finish in the top four of the Pac-12, preventing them from having a first-round bye. Still, the Trojans know they can’t make excuses and have to win the Pac-12 tournament to have a shot at playing in the NCAA tournament.
“In our situation and what our record is, [we’ve] got to be able to take advantage of going to Vegas and see what we can do,” Cantu said. “[We’ve] got one more opportunity to work on our stuff until that gets started.”
The Trojans are in a three-way tie with Washington and Arizona State for the six-seed. Washington holds the tiebreaker among the three teams.
The loss also halted some of the precious momentum the Trojans had gathered by winning six of their past eight games in remarkable fashion. Over that stretch, they averaged 69.5 points per game, shot 44.5 percent from the field and outrebounded their opponents by a plus-44 margin, 283-239.
None of that happened on Wednesday.
Next up for the Trojans are the Washington State Cougars, who are fresh off a shocking upset over the No. 23 UCLA Bruins. Though the Cougars have been the  bottom- dwellers of the Pac-12 for most of the season, it’s clear that the Trojans shouldn’t take them lightly. Last time these two teams met, the Trojans eked out a four-point victory, so it won’t be as easy as it looks on paper.
“They’re a different type of team than Washington,” Cantu said. “They run [a] great offense. We have two days here, so we have to regroup, watch film and see things that we need to work on individually and then put together our game plan for WSU on Saturday.”

After snapping an eight-game losing skid with two road wins against the Arizona schools last week, the USC women’s basketball team continued its momentum from the end of the regular season into the opening round of the                                           Pac-12 tournament on Thursday, defeating the No. 10-seeded Oregon State Beavers 64-57.
Moving on · Sophomore forward Alexyz Vaioletama and the Women of Troy shot just 29.2 percent for the game but forced 15 Oregon State turnovers and made it to the free-throw line a total of 46 times. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
USC (11-19, 7-11) was up 47-45 before scoring 15 of its last 17 points from the free-throw line. That would be the difference maker for the Women of Troy, as they got to the charity stripe a tournament-record 46 times, converting on 35 attempts for a solid 76 percent. The Beavers would only get to the line 12 times, making seven free throws.
“We wanted to be aggressive and take the ball to the basket,” USC head coach Michael Cooper said. “We knew that we had a little bit of a height advantage on them so we tried to get the ball inside and it worked to our benefit today.”
The Women of Troy, who are seeded seventh in the tournament after finishing 7-11 in Pac-12 conference play, will now go on to the quarterfinals on Friday to play the No. 2 seed. That team is Cal, the No. 5-ranked squad in the country. The Golden Bears were the Pac-12 co-champions with Stanford.
The Women of Troy dropped both meetings to the Golden Bears in regular season play. In Berkeley, USC played a close game and took the Golden Bears to overtime before falling 71-63. Down at the Galen Center, the setting was different, but the game yielded the same results, as USC lost 72-64.
“I think we match up very well with Cal and, every time we have played them, it has been a really tight game,” junior forward Cassie Harberts said.
Against Oregon State, the Women of Troy were led by sophomore guard Ariya Crook, who had 17 points off the bench. Harberts also had a big game, as she recorded yet another double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds. Right by her side was senior leader Christina Marinacci, who struggled from the field, where she made only two of 13 field goals, but ultimately finished with 13 points and eight rebounds, barely missing out on a double-double.
“We got stops, made shots on offense, made our free throws, and I feel that we really did a good job of doing that down stretch,” Harberts said.
The Beavers (10-21, 4-14) were led by sophomore guard Ali Gibson, who had 13 points, while senior guard Mollee Schwegler and junior guard Alyssa Martin dropped in 12 and 10 points, respectively. Though it came up short, Oregon State shot a blistering 44 percent from 3-point land. USC did not shoot as well, shooting 29 percent overall. The Women of Troy, however, outrebounded the Beavers 40-35 and forced 15 turnovers.
“We tried to cover up their strengths and make other players step up to score,” Cooper said.
USC led the Beavers 23-18 at the half, but Oregon State fought back in the second half thanks to a bevy of foul calls against the Women of Troy. USC was whistled for more fouls in the first three minutes of the second half than in the entire first half.
They dialed up some steals and big baskets in order to keep the lead, however, and held a 32-23 advantage with 15:00 remaining.
But Oregon State once again fought back, as it went on a 11-0 run to pull ahead at 34-32 with 13 minutes left. Harberts took over, though, going on to score nine straight USC points, and lifting her team to a 38-34 edge with 11 minutes to play.
It was a back-and-forth game from there until the Women of Troy took a commanding 54-45 lead — their largest of the game — after a basket by Miranacci. The Beavers got back to within four with 2:13 to go, but could not overcome USC’s stellar free throw shooting.
USC’s matchup against Cal is set for Friday at 12 p.m.
It was a pathetic win if there is such a thing. Season ends this afternoon with crushing loss to Cal.
Hopefully last game coached by Cooper at USC.

The industry’s still on an Oscars high, but the box office has been in the dumps lately. February was off 24 percent from the previous year, and the year as a whole is off to a weak start.
To be fair, this week last year was the highest-grossing opening in three months with giant openings from The Lorax and The Hunger Games. Nonetheless, when a $195 million budget film such as Jack the Giant Slayer barely manages to earb back an eighth of its cost, it’s cause for concern.
Coming to the rescue this weekend is Disney’s fantasy tentpole release Oz: The Great and Powerful, directed by Sam Raimi and starring James Franco (who is currently teaching a class at USC), Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz.
The film, a prequel to the events of the quintessential classic The Wizard of Oz, shows how a Midwestern magician eventually becomes the great and powerful Wizard of Oz.
This film actually isn’t the first time Disney has attempted another Oz project; Walt Disney himself wanted to create an animated adaptation, and the company held onto the rights to sequels for decades. They even managed to come out with the sequel Return of Oz, which did poorly in the eyes of critics and audiences back in the ’80s.
You only have to look at the billion-dollar success of Alice in Wonderland to know why the studio would finally develop this property: The success of that film has helped revive the fairy-tale genre, with this year alone already seeing Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and last week’s Jack and the Giant Slayer. Disney is already developing big-budget versions of Maleficent and Cinderella, so it’s very much committed to having these fairy-tale revisions as a staple of their live-action lineup.
Of course, if you mention Disney, March and giant budget, people will always think of John Carter. Incidentally, Oz was one of three giga-budget feature films, with the other one being the troubled The Lone Ranger, that was greenlit by Rich Ross, who is no longer with the company because of the failure of the Martian bomb. So, for almost a year, this film has been held in the same breath, with many worrying that it’ll suffer the same fate.
Disney has certainly been going all out with the marketing: Super Bowl ads, merchandise, even a tie-in with the addictive mobile franchise Temple Run. The main stars have been on a trailblazing publicity tour, and the feature feels like the first true cinematic event of the season. They’re also fully embracing the Alice in Wonderland connection, with the posters seeming like carbon copies of posters from that film.
There’s still a great deal of skepticism from other critics. The character Oz, in the context of the film and the novel, isn’t the most likeable or interesting figure in the series. Judging by fan blogs, there really doesn’t seem to have been much demand for his origin. Not to mention the fact that the ads keep hammering his supposed importance and alleged powers, which most of the audience knows doesn’t exist having seen The Wizard of Oz. The audience’s familiarity with the storyline is an inherent flaw with prequels in general. If we know Oz isn’t a wizard and won’t become one, why do they keep saying in every trailer that he’s the prophesized Wizard of Oz?
An Oz prequel isn’t even a revolutionary idea. In fact, a cinematic adaptation of Wicked, the Broadway phenomenon that depicts a sympathetic origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West, was put on hold because of this project going forward. In all honesty, Wicked would’ve made for a more compelling story compared to the generic “misplaced messiah” plot that, unfortunately, shares a lot of similarities with John Carter.
Also not helping is that though they brought on Sam Raimi, the director behind the Spider-Man and Evil Dead trilogies, the ads seem to have none of his kinetic style. Instead they look very artificial, similar to the green screen indulgence of Alice in Wonderland, which was one of viewers’ main complaints about the feature. Everything looks fake and people just don’t buy into that.
The world of Oz is a great vessel of material, and it’s a shame we haven’t had a chance to go back to it in the modern era of filmmaking. But instead of adapting something like Wicked or one of the countless sequels from L. Frank Baum himself, such as Ozma of Oz, it’s disappointing that Disney decided to go with what seems to be such an uninspired origin story.
There’s a lot of money invested in the feature, and audiences are practically dying for something epic and worthwhile to check out. Though many pundits have pegged anywhere from a $50 million to a $80 million-plus opening, which would still pale in comparison to its budget, it shouldn’t be surprising if this ends up on the lower end of that range, maybe even slightly below with a high $40 million amount.
It’s not quite defying gravity, but it might put the year back on the right track for the box office.

Nestled between a hair salon and clothing store is a shop that gives off the seductive scent of sugar and fresh cream.
That shop is Carmela, a new parlor that opened its doors last week on Third Street near The Grove. Cute inside and out, the store offers ice cream enthusiasts an alternative selection of flavors than that of a traditional creamery. Co-founders Jessica Mortarotti and Zachary Cox offer organic-based flavors, and it’s obvious they know their stuff when it comes to the ingredients they work with.

For about six years, the married couple sold their product at various farmer’s markets in the city. Little by little, they gained a following for their unique flavors and they eventually set up their first shop in Pasadena. In 2009, Los Angeles Magazine recognized Carmela as a “Best of LA,” and in 2011, LA Weekly named them the “#1 Ice Cream Shop.”
On a sunny weekday, the couple greeted customers at their newly opened Los Angeles store. Curious passersby could choose to sample an assortment of flavors, ranging from salted caramel to Aztec chocolate.
But despite their current success, neither Cox nor Mortarotti envisioned opening Carmela one day. As much as the couple knows how to sell their creations today, a few years ago they just started making ice cream as a spur-of-the-moment idea.
“We were like ‘What do you wanna do?’ ‘I don’t know, let’s start a business,’ Cox said. “‘What business?’ ‘I don’t know — ice cream.’ And we were like ‘Yeah, sounds good.’”
The co-founders knew each other through their fathers, whom attended school together. Both grew up in the suburbs of Berkeley in Northern California; Cox eventually attended USC and Mortarotti later found a job in Los Angeles. Once they decided to open their own ice cream joint, a bigger question loomed: How does one make ice cream, anyway?
The two found out about Penn State University’s “Ice Cream Short Course,” which trained renowned ice cream titans such as the makers of Ben and Jerry’s and Dreyer’s. They decided Mortarotti could take those lessons and come back to Los Angeles with her newfound knowledge.
“We flew her out there, she came back and she was like ‘I have no clue how to make ice cream,’” Cox said.
After that idea flopped, the two decided to try it out on their own.
“We started experimenting at home and taught ourselves, essentially. That’s the main reason we teach lessons at our Pasadena location,” Cox said. “We teach people how to make ice cream with a home mixer.”
They eventually worked out of a kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, introducing their concoctions at farmers markets. All of the flavors contain organic ingredients, which they often find at these markets. The couple didn’t just want to make good ice cream — they wanted to make something deliciously different.
“Our concept from the beginning was to do rich, creamy ice cream but with garden-inspired flavors,” Cox said. “The first flavor that Jessica worked on was a rose-petal ice cream. We like to take a lot of produce from the farmers markets: Our mint chip ice cream is fresh mint we steeped in milk.
The name Carmela comes from Mortarotti’s grandmother, who instilled in Mortarotti a fascination for cooking at a young age.
“She was a baker, so some of my childhood memories are of me sitting on the counter with her making chocolate cake or whatever,” she said.
The idea of cooking scrumptious food in the kitchen carries on into the decisions Mortarotti makes when conceptualizing her next ice cream flavor. Many of the flavors carry a hidden kick at the end — the lavender honey leaves eaters with a light, sweet aftertaste and the Aztec chocolate, which does not taste spicy right away, but leaves the eater’s throat tingling. The unique combination of flavors transforms a simple scoop of ice cream into something similar to a bite of a delicious meal or a sip of tea (Carmela carries an Earl Grey tea flavor).
“I just tend to look at what kind of flavors work together in other applications, not just necessarily ice cream,” Mortarotti said. “For example, the brown-butter sage flavor …  works really well in pasta dishes and other types of food, so it does translate to ice cream. We also do a lot of jam recipes that kind of work with the sorbet recipes. I always want to find ways to combine herbs and spices with fresh, seasonal fruits. That’s a big part of what we do.”
Another part of what they do? They work to retain a strong sense of local community within the shop. At one point, a customer walked in and remarked she recognized the couple from farmers markets and congratulated them on their new location.
With Carmela’s warm, welcoming atmosphere and its decadent desserts it is easy to imagine the shop becoming a Los Angeles institution.
Like Los Angeles itself, though, the shop is always changing; new flavors pop up based on the season and a wealth of other factors. But no matter the choices, Carmela will make you think twice about buying that same-ol’ supermarket ice cream.

Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s decision to pardon Japanese Emperor Hirohito of war crimes following World War II sparked controversy around the globe.
Emperor, a period piece with good intentions, but ultimately weak results, tries to psychoanalyze MacCarthur’s decision through the eyes of Bonner Fellers (Matthew Fox), a man who Director Peter Webber apparently believes played a much larger role in the decision than history remembers. The film has a lot of promise, with historical nuances and gorgeous production design, but the film’s threadbare storyline makes it fall flat.

Emperor follows Bonner as he seeks to uncover Hirohito’s true involvement in the war. The main premise of this film relies heavily on the audience not actually knowing who Bonner is. In actuality, he is a little-known soldier who is better known for having his codes decoded by the Germans than for his postwar diplomacy. Still, following the end of World War II, MacArthur appointed Bonner to determine whether Hirohito should be tried for war crimes.
There is no question that the history surrounding the film is intriguing, but Webber tries to stretch reality a bit too far when he makes one of Bonner’s primary missions in the film locating a mysterious Japanese woman, Aya Shimada (Eriko Hatsune), whom he met years before in the United States when she was an exchange student.
The problem with Shimada is that she has little relevance to the fate of the emperor. Though she helps fuel Bonner’s interest in Japanese culture, she does little else. Bonners and Aya’s love story also lacks chemistry.
Despite that, the film constantly switches back to Aya as Bonner comes closer to making perhaps the most influential decision in the Japan’s history. Other than the fact that Aya lives in Japan, she has little to do with the main plot and her scenes — interspersed with those of Bonner interviewing various Japanese officials to gain more insight into Hirohito’s role — could easily be cut to give more room to the actual historical events unfolding in the film.
Emperor’s strengths, after all, are in its historical roots. As a period piece, nothing is more riveting then seeing  actual footage of the events taking place, and Emperor does its job through a spectacular display of editing magic, seamlessly mixing real footage with the rest of the film. Scenes such as the opening, which uses footage from the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, is a chilling visual that instantly transports the audience to 1945.
The production design is equally spectacular. The team of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh, production designer Grant Major and costume designer Ngila Dickson masterfully crafts a post-apocalyptic Japan on the verge of ruin. The attention to detail, from the decorations on MacArthur’s uniform to the mass of decay sprawled across the city, is remarkable.
But attention to detail does not make up for the weak storyline. Overall, Emperor just tries to do too much by cramming in the detail a period piece demands with the drama of taboo love. The ambition of this film leaves too many loose ends and creates an underlying feeling of discord.
Fox’s performance, in particular, leaves the audience with more questions than answers. When Bonner gets into a bar fight with some local patrons, it just seems to come out of nowhere. There is no buildup of frustration to justify his actions. Also, his anger doesn’t seem convincing. Fox’s forgettable performance in the film unfortunately might contribute to Bonner’s forgettable identity in history.
The larger-than-life persona of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, on the other hand, is portrayed masterfully by Tommy Lee Jones. In a role that requires a sense of authority and respect, Jones hits all the right notes with his tremendous talent. He carries a reputation as one of the most respected men in Hollywood, and it shows in his portrayal of MacArthur.
Jones’ MacArthur steals the spotlight in every scene that he is in and it is hilarious to watch Jones play this authoritative and quirky figure. Jones plays up MacArthur’s eccentricity, which is humorously noted in the film when the character makes a cameraman take several pictures of him every time he comes into a scene. Jones’ performance stands out as one of the most noteworthy aspects of this film, and it’s too bad the rest of the film can’t keep up with his excellence.
From the earliest stages of pre-production, this film carried with it high aspirations and ambitions. It could have been a remarkable period piece cross-examining one of the most vulnerable points in Japan’s history. Instead, its scattered plotline and unremarkable characters leave much to be desired.

The USC women’s tennis team will return to action on Friday with a matchup against crosstown rival UCLA.
The Women of Troy enter the matchup ranked No. 12 in the nation. Their only losses over the past two seasons have been to top-10 teams, with this year being no different. The Trojans were defeated by top-ranked North Carolina at the ITA National Team Indoor championships in Virginia last month, and suffered a bitter loss at the hands of No. 7 Cal to open up conference play.
A victory over the Bruins would most likely catapult USC back into the top 10, where it spent the entire season before the loss to the Golden Bears.
UCLA enters the game ranked No. 3 nationally with a 9-1 record. The Women of Troy will certainly be looking to issue some level of payback for their last meeting. USC was eliminated by UCLA in last year’s NCAA semifinals in a heartbreaking 4-3 loss.
With such a marquee matchup on the schedule, any team would be remiss to be without some of its major contributors. Luckily for the Trojans, everyone should be healthy and ready to compete against the Bruins.
“I think we’ll have everyone for tomorrow so we’re excited to go,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said.
The Women of Troy enter the game following a win over a San Diego team that USC has historically dominated (26-3). With that kind of history, it would be easy to overlook a 5-2 victory over San Diego, but Gallien certainly did not. In fact, it is theirdominating performance against the Aztecs that has Gallien so optimistic about the matchup with the Bruins.
“The girls won a super gutsy match last week to set this up,” Gallien said. “Our mood is terrific and I fully expect we will play well tomorrow.”
Following the matchup against the Bruins, the Trojans will begin a three-game homestand kicked off by a matchup next Tuesday against the Texas Longhorns. The Women of Troy are undefeated at home this season.
The game in Westwood will begin at 1:30 p.m.

While it is hard to overlook the USC men’s volleyball team’s trip to the MPSF championship match just a year ago, the club’s mounting losses and inability to sustain consistent periods of execution have put an even greater premium on winning, and winning now.
The Trojans will look to right the ship this weekend in Honolulu, where they will face off against Hawai’i on Friday and Sunday to conclude their four-game road trip. After christening the trip with a decisive 3-1 victory over Pacific, the Trojans fell 3-2 to Stanford on Sunday, dropping to 4-9 on the season.
The triumph against Pacific was a welcome sight for USC head coach Bill Ferguson, who saw his team drop three consecutive critical matches during a four-game homestand at the Galen Center.
“I thought we took care of the easy plays a lot better,” Ferguson said. “We focused the entire week on outplaying and out-competing the opponent. We talked to them about playing at an increased intensity, and we felt like we withstood their challenge, so winning was huge for us.”
Not surprisingly, the Trojans were once again led by their workhorses, as redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jansen recorded 21 kills while sophomore middle blocker Robert Feathers collected 16 kills. The momentum failed to lift the team against the Cardinal, however, as the Trojans recorded 20 service errors en route to the five-set defeat.
“We’re starting to rack up some more aces, which is good, but we still have a high number of errors,” Ferguson said. “We’ve had to become more of a high-risk, high-reward team. Our team has to get used to playing in that manner. We dug ourselves a hole early, but I thought we did a great job of coming back in the fourth set and staying involved in the match.”
The team’s subpar performance throughout the season is glaring in comparison to the success of the 2012 squad, and it remains to be seen whether Ferguson’s optimism and emphasis on greater team effort will come as motivational tools for his players as they enter the second half of their schedule. Still, it is important to note that while last year’s team cruised to a 24-6 record and an appearance in the championship game, they were able to do so on the strength of 2012 national player of the year Tony Ciarelli and All-American middle blocker Steven Shandrick , both of whom are gone.
“I think our guys understand the importance of our opponents and the importance of the season,” Ferguson said. “They know what these games mean to us and they are aware of the task at hand, so we’ll be ready to go.”
Despite the team’s struggles this season, a trip to Hawai’i not only represents a homecoming for multiple players on the squad, but also provides a better playing atmosphere, in Ferguson’s eyes.
“(Hawai’i) is probably the best volleyball environment in the country, and it’s something our guys look forward to because the fans are knowledgeable and there’s a lot of love for us over there,” Ferguson said. “It’s a great place to play volleyball, but we know that the Warriors serve well and pass well, so we need to focus on excelling in those aspects because they will direct the show.”
Following the doubleheader, the Trojans come back home for three games, starting with a match against 2012 champion UC Irvine next Friday.

With the array of metal detectors and lines of uniformed security guards a fixture of today’s travel experiences, there’s no doubt that airport security has been radically transformed by the 9/11 attacks — air travel has not been, nor will it ever be, quite the same again.
But rules change as years pass.
This week, the Transportation Security Administration announced that on April 25, the ban on pocketknives and various sporting equipment aboard planes will be lifted. Though some logical reasons have been given for the repeal of the ban, none seem good enough to justify this abrupt relaxation of rules. If anything, America’s wounds from 9/11 still remain, and relaxation of security rules can only make that wound more vulnerable.
Going 12 years back to the hectic aftermath of 9/11, airport security skyrocketed overnight. Just two months after the attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the TSA, which took over screening responsibilities from airlines. Multiple luggage screeners scan every piece of baggage today; only 5 percent of checked baggage was inspected before 9/11, according to the Billings Gazette. Plus, long security lines at airports have become a familiar fixture that Americans are now accustomed to.
Having said that, it is understandable that some travelers feel uncomfortable with this lift in the ban on small knives, hockey sticks, golf clubs, toy bats, billiard cues and ski poles. Though the TSA’s laundry list of seemingly nonsensical prohibited items has ellicited criticism from security experts and policy pundits in past years, now it seems that some of the public has been outraged over the ban. Therefore, the reaction to an effort to clean up the list seems to be the opposite of the expected.
According to CNN, flight attendant unions have been quick to complain that the relaxation of rules would expose cabin crew to dangers and make flights less safe. And George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said in a statement that “It’s as if we didn’t learn anything from 9/11. Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks.” This only goes to show that no matter how often they harp over the strict guidelines, people still prefer the better-safe-than-sorry mantra.
According to the Daily Mail, this change seeks to bring TSA security guidelines more in line with International Civil Aviation Organization standards for creating better travel experiences. Logical as this might seem, the TSA apparently did not take into account the psychological effect restriction loosening would have on passengers.
Yes, small knives shorter than 2.36 inches might not seem like real weapons, but people’s paranoia is capable of distorting the harm of such a tool, and the last thing we need is more people on edge in airports and in flights. Also, a person that sets out to do damage with a 2.5-inch blade is capable of damage that should never be underestimated. A knife is a knife, no matter how small, and just knowing that they’re allowed through gives way to uneasiness all the same.
The danger that objects such as pocketknives or modified ski poles pose can be as real as the “real” threats of bombs and guns. After all, security is only as strong as its weakest link.
The emotional disruption that comes with the lift of this ban is a significant factor to consider. In the days since the TSA announcement, family members of 9/11 victims have been speaking out against the changes with concerns that reach beyond psychological fears to losses close to the heart.
The alarm is real and the disturbed emotions are real. And threats, no matter how tiny, have real consequences — even the ones that come in the form of pocketknives.

What about lacrosse sticks?  Seems my sport always gets the shaft!
That said – maybe they should work more towards “relaxing” the ban on my bringing my bottle of water on board, than ski-poles, bats, or other items that can be equally safely checked in as regular baggage. Bringing pocket knives on board (there is a size limit) doesn’t pose a flight risk, either.
Bit paranoid, aren’t you?

Private First Class Bradley Manning plead guilty this week to 10 charges associated with his role in leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks, according to NPR. Manning, who perpetrated the biggest leak in U.S. military and State Department history in 2010, did not plead guilty to aiding the enemy — the most serious charge — and will stand trial for that offense later this year.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
During his allocution, Manning said he released the classified documents and military cables to spark a debate about the United States military and the goal of United States statecraft. Manning felt that the documents, which had been widely circulated within the military, would not endanger his fellow soldiers, so he decided to send the documents to WikiLeaks.
Manning’s actions, however, were harmful and illegal.
First and foremost, leaking classified military documents harms the effectiveness of United States military action and places American military men and women in danger. Manning leaked classified documents about American military practices  and policies, forcing the military to change many of those practices and shift personnel.
In the time necessary to change military practices, the combat effectiveness of the American military was severely compromised, according to The New York Times. Consequently, the men and women on the ground in combat zones could not act effectively to accomplish their missions, and placing them in danger. Whether or not Manning disagreed with the mission of the military is irrelevant; he put the lives of fellow American soldiers in danger.
Furthermore, the method with which Manning attempted to bring about a public debate concerning the nation and its military was wrong.
Manning specifically mentioned an incident in which an American helicopter fired upon reporters who had a camera that looked similar to a rocket launcher, according to Yahoo, as being an impetus for the leaks. Manning was so aghast at the actions of the helicopter that he felt it needed to be shown to the public.
But if the American pilots acted improperly, then the court that should rule on the issue is a military tribunal. Manning attempted to move the jurisdiction of the case from the established military courts to some kind of court of public opinion. Yet the fact remains that the American public should not necessarily have much input in judging these soldiers because that is not how military infractions are dealt with.
Essentially, Manning was trying to bring the actions of the military to public attention to create a general outcry necessary to create change.
True, America’s democracy is predicated on the American people having a voice. That voice, however, cannot be consulted for every individual matter of criminal justice. Military cases are fraught with complexities and details that the public is not always qualified to judge, and opening up military trials to public opinion could lead to flawed decisions based on emotion rather than the needs and policies of the military.
On a broader note, Manning fails to realize is that public outcry cannot always be the major determining factor of the American justice system, as it could erode the basic legal ground on which the U.S. operates.
The United States is a liberal democracy, meaning that U.S. citizens are guaranteed certain inalienable rights that cannot be restricted by the majority. This is the reason that the United States has a Bill of Rights in the Constitution; those rights cannot be restricted by the tyranny of the majority. The Bill of Rights, however, only stands if the United States is a liberal democracy and not a true democracy, in which everything is put to a vote.
By leaking documents to WikiLeaks, Manning is trying to shift the existing justice system within the military toward that a true democracy. If the military’s actions are consistently controlled by public opinion, however, the rule-based system of war collapses. The Geneva Convention has already laid out internationally accepted and respected rules of war. Manning is trying to change that without regard to the integrity or the efficacy of the current system.
At that point, when American troops can be constantly questioned over conduct and the American military changes on the basis of the will of the majority, protections preventing helicopter pilots from shooting press members would theoretically fall into question, too. Even worse, the possibilities for increased aggressive action or retributive justice based on the will of the public, especially after an event that shocks and unifies the nation like 9/11, become far too likely.
At the point where American policy is being determined by a national conscience that can so easily be swayed, nothing and no one is safe. Manning has failed to realize that though the current system for military justice might not be perfect, his viewpoint has dangerous flaws all their own.
