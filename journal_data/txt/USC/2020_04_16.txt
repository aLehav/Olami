Zoom, the video conferencing app that’s officially supported by USC and hosting most USC lectures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, has come under fire over the past few weeks due to security and privacy concerns. The wave of scrutiny has resulted in a class-action lawsuit, inquiries from the New York attorney general, and letters from U.S. senators in regards to how the app shares user data with third parties and partakes in other shady privacy practices. 
On top of these security concerns, “Zoombombers” have begun to interrupt and disrupt meetings and classes. In response, the company has rolled out extra security measures; starting April 5, Zoom now requires a password to join a meeting using the meeting ID. USC’s Chief Information Officer Douglas Shook also responded by sharing a resource page with strategies to prevent “Zoombombing.” 
In this case, the University did act appropriately, but the large cause of these issues in the first place was faculty not receiving proper instruction onin how to use the included security tools with the platform — the memos and resource page from ITS are a step forward in the right direction.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon, the U.S. Senate, Google and school leaders from New York City to Las Vegas have announced they’re moving to the more secure Zoom Government or discontinuing their use of Zoom due to security, privacy and harassment concerns. Schools, companies and other institutions have begun to switch to other alternatives, such as Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, Cisco WebEx and BlueJeans, which USC also officially licenses.
So why is USC still using Zoom as its primary video conferencing tool?
Zoom’s privacy policies have been highlighted as being vaguely worded and having notable omissions. In short, the issue seems to be one of transparency. Students are able to access a list with the contact information of more than 24,000 people registered with Zoom through USC and nearly 40 “Zoom Rooms” by accessing the contacts tab on the app. This is a grave privacy concern, and hopefully USC ITS will disable this access if possible, as it may be maliciously utilized.
Additionally, moving to virtual classes has highlighted who has access to fast internet, working computers and a safe — and quiet — space to work from. Financial inequities in the classroom are therefore put on full display when we virtually invite people into our homes, whether through live video meetings like Zoom or otherwise. 
Time zone differences and other pressures may affect the extent to which students can participate in synchronous learning — education that happens in real-time, like a lecture. Many professors have moved toward asynchronous learning, with less reliance on live lectures and more reliance on Blackboard discussions and the like. Many have also made lectures non-mandatory for students unable to attend a live lecture due to time-zone constraints or other reasons while expanding asynchronous learning opportunities for students to engage with the course material. 
Moreover, Zoom meetings and live lectures should only be a secondary option for faculty, as asynchronous learning opportunities are more effective than synchronous learning plans, which are teacher-centric rather than student-centric by their very nature. The best version of all, however, is offering a balance between the two while ensuring privacy and security.
But USC cannot depend solely on a platform that has the best technological measures to maintain the security and privacy of students, faculty and staff. It is up to the University to facilitate an environment wherein faculty and staff are sensitized to issues of privacy and security in this virtual environment. 
USC ITS has been proactive in issuing memos to minimize the risk of information being compromised. On USC’s COVID-19 resource page and on the ITS website, numerous resources and tips are provided to instruct students, faculty and staff to protect themselves amid this uncertainty. Even measures such as using complex passwords and waiting rooms — which ITS has since made mandatory — can help prevent unwelcome intruders.
Regardless, the University must encourage and ensure that students, faculty and staff have access to platforms that balance usefulness with privacy and security. Zoom, based on the above, might not be that choice.

Arguably nothing is as ubiquitous in stoner culture as 420. We giggle when the clock strikes 4:20 p.m. (or a.m.), and we try to catch a glimpse of the number on various screens — from our phones to our microwaves. Now, as we find ourselves in a monthlong 420 amid unprecedented times, it’s like we’re the punchline of one big cosmic joke. But what the fuck even is 420?
Although commonly mistaken as the penal code for cannabis use, 420’s origins trace back to the fall of 1971. A group of five high school stoners from Marin County in Northern California got word of a U.S. Coast Guard service member who could no longer tend to his cannabis plants. The group, nicknamed the Waldos, would meet at a statue of Louis Pasteur at San Rafael High at 4:20 p.m. after sports practice, get high and resume their quest for the hidden treasure. The code for meeting up? “4:20-Louis.” But “Louis” was eventually dropped. Although the Waldos never encountered the coveted cannabis plot after weeks of searching, their slang permeated the country as Marin County quickly became the epicenter of the counterculture movement of the ’60s.
Inadvertently, 420 became a popular culture phenomenon — one that is still relevant today. Slang surrounding weed and its consumption was born out of secrecy, a way to disguise criminal activity from any points of authority: teachers, parents, law enforcement. If no one understands what you’re actually talking about, it can’t really be held against you, right?
So what do we talk about when we talk about weed? With criminalization and prohibition, cannabis subculture — and the language around it — flourished. Weed culture, considered subversive and anti-establishment, cloaked itself under rich, creative linguistics. Cannabis wasn’t simply a product, it was a cultural staple.
Slang is just one of the many facets of a subculture that indicates belonging and community. A form of in-group signaling, when two people communicate through the same slang, they demonstrate a shared set of interests. As cannabis slang quickly spread beyond its local origins, it adapted just as rapidly so as to avoid detection by government officials. New words were implanted into the subculture to remain subversive and mask criminality.
Cannabis slang can be put into six categories, including words that reference the effects of the strain (giggle weed), its appearance (grass) and deceptive code words (gas). Hundreds of phrases we use today date back to much earlier than we think. Slang commonly believed to trace back to the 1960s actually has origins in the 1930s. Terms such as cannabis and ganja have existed for centuries and have historically been used to describe the medicinal qualities of the plant.
At the same time, slang evolved rapidly over the decades, with hyperlocal terminology dominating by the 1970s as hippie culture grew. But now, with legalization and decriminalization efforts cropping up, the way we talk about cannabis has shifted yet again.
Society has largely graduated from the illicit trading of cash for dime bags and the necessity of cannabis code words to glass counters at lux dispensaries and open, public conversation about one’s latest trip. What was once sketchy and criminal (of course, not if you’re white though!) is now the new hype — crisply pre-packaged, mechanically pre-rolled, expertly marketed and tied up in a neat, nice bow for the consumer. 
As with everything, capitalism has taken a huge shit on cannabis. The commodification of weed has stripped cannabis of its cultural iconicity. Legalization has unwittingly brought with it consumerism and, ultimately, the immense loss of community. We have to face it: Weed has been gentrified.
Nothing points this out as clearly as the names of myriad popularized dispensaries. With vague, clinical names, weed shops reflect the exact opposite of cannabis’ rich history of vibrant jargon. The dreaded gentrified MedMen (also known as the Apple Store of weed shops) just sounds like a bad Netflix Original, while places such as New Age Care Center bring forth images of retirement homes or hubs where pseudoscience reigns supreme. Arguably, we have lost what makes weed, weed. 
Businesses don’t want to call it pot or chronic or loud or anything else informal. In the struggle to establish themselves as serious capital ventures, dispensaries stick to just calling it cannabis or, even worse, marijuana. While I can’t really blame them, as the mainstream public and government officials still see weed as a nuisance indicative of delinquent behavior, I can’t say it’s my cup of tea. Slowly, but surely, cannabis is becoming everything weed smokers were historically against.
We are trending toward a reality where cannabis is just another product — one to be advertised, sold and consumed (not that there’s anything wrong with the lattermost). I’m not saying that we should revert to prohibition; I’m just asking for a gram of culture, a nug of enjoyment. While terms denoting wellness or care may highlight pot’s medicinal qualities, they are — quite frankly — bland. 
But cannabis culture is pervasive and intrinsically adaptive — stoners aren’t going anywhere. Creative dispensary names, such as The Pottery, Smokey’s 420 House and Bud Hut, remain. And as always, slang adapts and evades extinction. From mid to presh, chop to the Devil’s lettuce, hyperlocal and mainstream jargon persists. People stay baked, blazed, zooted, faded and sauteed (not really sure if the last one exists outside my friend group, but I would like to see it become a thing).
While I’m glad cannabis is losing its stigma, it’s also clear we’re losing much more. We’ve moved on from clandestine transactions that sparked rich enclaves and language adaptations to socioculturally insignificant (yet, I admit, convenient) weed delivery services. Perhaps that one British television show was right: The secret ingredient is crime.

FX’s much awaited “Mrs. America,” an American drama television series based on actual events, premiered Wednesday on Hulu with the first three episodes of the nine-part series. The show captures the political landscape of the ’70s, when the struggle and debate over the equal rights amendment was on the uproar. Told through the eyes of the women from the era, the show chronicles the fight between supporters of the women’s liberation movement and antifeminists. A stellar cast of actors, magnificent cinematography, a fantastic concept, setting and dialogue make this an exceptional watch.
The concept for “Mrs. America” was developed by Emmy award-winning writer Dahvi Waller, who also wrote “Mad Men.” In the first episode, which takes place in 1971, we are introduced to the antifeminist and central conservative figure of the show, Phyllis Schlafly (Cate Blanchett). An Illinois housewife and mother of six, our first introduction of Schlafly comes as she’s modeling an American flag bikini in a political fundraiser for Rep. Phil Crane. 
The thing about Schlafly is that she defies what you’d think every woman during the women’s liberation movement of the ’70s would embody. She strongly believes in a woman’s duty to the household, her children and her husband. Set on her conservative beliefs, Schlafly doesn’t believe in women’s abortion rights (a hot topic in the second episode) and wants the Equal Rights Amendment of 1972 abolished. Her radical thinking and opinions lead to tension and debate in the political landscape. 
Several aspects of the show, including the aesthetics, make it so both sides of the political fence are distinguishable. Groovy tunes, typewriters, rotary phones and vintage color palettes of deep blues, oranges and yellows bring us directly into the style of the ’70s. “Mrs. America” presents a remarkable cinematic experience through its effective writing, production design, costume design and cinematography. Leather and suede textures, platform wedges and funky patterns characterize the fashion of the ’70s. When it comes to producing a period piece like this, costume design can make or break the show. 
Each episode’s title is named after a central character highlighted as the key figure in the episode. Writing polarizing characters into a script that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats is challenging, but this series achieves it splendidly. 
The first episode takes us through various settings, landscapes and character dimensions of Schlafly. Inspired by one of the most divisive woman figures in American history, Blanchett brilliantly emanates Schlafly’s canny, willful personality from the get-go. Scene three showcases Blanchett’s incredible ability to achieve the tone of this character. The scene takes place in a dressing room when the handsy Illinois congressman Crane enters and invites her to come to Washington D.C. to meet with Sen. Barry Goldwater. Schlafly is excited about the invite, as it could potentially be an opportunity to gain support for her congressional run, but when she gets to D.C., Goldwater unexpectedly inquires about her perspective on the Equal Rights Amendment and whether or not she supports it. Her response is telling of her ideals and personal morals that will be present throughout the series. She says to Goldwater, “I think some women like to blame sexism for their failures instead of admitting they didn’t try hard enough, so good for you for opposing it.” 
For the antifeminists, costume designer Bina Daigeler deliberately chose a soft style, dressing them in pastels, knit sweaters, aprons and A-line skirts. Their costumes accurately present the traditional American housewife look of the ‘70s. You never see them dressed in pants or the bohemian looks iconic to the ’70s. Schafly’s character was meant to look put together and in control at all times. 
For everyone else, urban hippie looks abound. Specifically, the feminists introduced at the end of the first episode, namely Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan —  who Schlafly rallies against — were dressed in more free-spirited looks, alluding to their more liberal political beliefs and values. Episode two mostly revolves around Steinem, the ’70s glamorous, career woman who gets pressured into becoming the face of the women’s liberation movement by Rep. Bella Abzug. Aviators, T-shirts, embroidered prints, polka dots, beaded jewelry and anything that the antifeminists would never dare to wear define the style and characters of Steinem and Friedan.  
Soft colors and grainy, faded hues of green and blue fill the screen. Episode three, “Shirley,” is written to put you through an emotional rollercoaster. Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba) gives an incredible performance that effectively delivers the frustrating and fierce emotions of a Black woman not only running for president but fighting against discrimination as a matter of survival. Facing opposition from all angles, she is compelled to make a change. Working tirelessly, viewers can feel Shirley’s emotions straight through the screen. Episode three is a politically complex episode. 
Cast-wise, “Mrs. America” delivers. The list of powerhouse performers is refreshing and ingenious: Aduba, Elizabeth Banks, Blanchett, Rose Byrne, Margo Martindale, Niecy Nash, Sarah Paulson, John Slattery, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Tracey Ullman. An all-star team in front of and behind the lens, “Mrs. America” is a tribute to the past and can teach a new generation of women how to do the right thing and get others to do the same. 
The remaining six episodes will be airing every Wednesday following this week on the FX channel on Hulu.

Often in the world of college sports, when a once-hyped recruit now battling for a starting job suddenly finds himself looking for greener pastures elsewhere, the oversimplified narrative sounds the same: “He didn’t want to compete”; “He’s just taking the easy way out.” 
I hope I hear none of that slander surrounding JT Daniels. 
Head coach Clay Helton announced the news Thursday that we all saw coming, yet still arrived rather suddenly: Daniels is entering his name into the transfer portal. 
As soon as the then-sophomore quarterback went down in the first half of USC’s season opener last season and true freshman Kedon Slovis jumped onto the scene with impressive performances against Fresno State and Stanford, there was talk around town that Slovis was playing himself into the starting job next year.
Relax, I said. I warned everyone not to forget Slovis was still a three-star recruit, Daniels was a five-star and — as much as the talk surrounding Daniels’ play might hint otherwise — Daniels showed flashes of outstanding promise in 2018. Slovis would have to go absolutely berserk for the rest of the season if he wanted to make this a competition. 
But go absolutely berserk Slovis did. In fact, so much so that now it’s extremely difficult to argue that anyone other than No. 9 should be under center against Alabama come (fingers crossed) Sept. 5. 
It was a perfect storm that allowed Slovis to take over the driver’s seat for that role, and very little of that storm is due to Daniels’ play. Was the 2,672-yard, 59.5% completion percentage and 14-10 touchdown-to-interception ratio everything Trojan fans hoped for from the No. 2 pro-style quarterback in the Class of 2018? Of course not. Was it enough to single-handedly lose him the starting job? No way in hell. (That’s why it didn’t in 2019.)
No, it was Slovis and his brilliant rookie season — one of the best of all time in USC football history — that forced Daniels’ hand. 
There’s not a single school in the nation that wouldn’t take a shot on Daniels — well, unless that school’s quarterback is Trevor Lawrence. Daniels should realize that, and I’m glad his decision to search for a better opportunity seems to reflect that. It’s not at all an indictment of his performance. It’s simply a result of Slovis’ dominance combined with the fact that Daniels missed out on a year of grooming by offensive coordinator Graham Harrell that should have Slovis primed to — dare I say it — compete for a Heisman Trophy in 2020.
As Slovis gradually became “the man” over the course of the 2019 season, Daniels and his family remained steadfast in their commitment to USC. In early December — after Slovis’ final regular season game — Daniels’ father said his son was “definitely” staying at USC to compete for the starting job, verbally pointing to the quarterback’s USC-themed leg tattoo as a sign of his desire to stay and win the job back from Slovis. 
But you just knew. You knew there was no chance Daniels would close his doors and refuse an opportunity — at least the chance — to look for a school where he could be the guy, he could thrive, he could be the unquestionable pilot of the offense without having to worry about his job security.
After all, that’s what Daniels deserves. It’s not a cop-out, not a lack of competitive fire. Daniels could have very well gone into fall camp with a chip on his shoulder, played his heart out and won the job while Slovis faltered. It’s a possibility. 
But truthfully, that felt unlikely. The job was Slovis’ to win. And what if that happened and Slovis got the starting job again? Imagine it’s late August, Daniels is the backup and either has to transfer into an entirely new situation with no time to learn the program before the season starts or let his five-star talent rot for another year on the bench at USC. I’m no college athlete, but that doesn’t feel like the most desirable of situations. 
Ever since Slovis made the quarterback situation interesting, this was an inevitable crossroads. Only one of the two could win the job for 2020, and one would inevitably get the short end of the stick. Both, either way, would be capable and worthy enough of starting at quarterback for the all-time winningest football program west of the Mississippi. 
But only one can. More and more, that has appeared to be Slovis. Daniels did what he had to do. So please, whether Daniels is still at USC come September or not, do him, my sanity and logical human beings everywhere a massive favor: Leave the slander in 2018.

Redshirt sophomore quarterback JT Daniels has entered his name into the transfer portal, head coach Clay Helton announced in a statement posted to USC Athletics’ Twitter Thursday.
“We have been working with JT and his family, as well as our compliance office, to help him navigate the process of entering his name in the transfer portal,” the statement read. “It is his desire to explore all of his options going into the 2020 season.” 
Daniels, a five-star recruit and 247Sports’ No. 2 pro-style quarterback in the class of 2018, won the starting quarterback battle during fall camp leading up to the 2019 season over then-freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis. But Daniels tore his ACL and meniscus in the second quarter of USC’s season opening win against Fresno State after throwing for 215 yards on 25-of-34 passing, one touchdown and one interception. 
The blow sidelined him for the rest of the season. 
From there, Slovis took off. Slovis threw for 3,502 yards and a 71.9% completion percentage — the latter being the third-highest mark in the nation. Slovis, a three-star recruit out of high school, and Daniels were expected to battle again for the starting job this fall. 
“I love this university, coaching staff, and team,” Daniels told USC Scoop. “To me it is in my best interest to explore all my options going into the 2020 season. I will remain in contact with the coaching staff through the process. USC remains one of my options, and that door has remained open for me. Fight on.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, USC is optimistic that Daniels will remain at USC if the NCAA votes not to grant immediate eligibility for transfers who currently have to sit out a year before returning to competition.
“We will continue to support JT in every way possible and help him through his decision, including the option of staying on with our football team,” Helton’s statement read. “JT is a terrific person, student, player, and valued member of our football family.”
