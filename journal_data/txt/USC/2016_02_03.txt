USC welcomed Gloria Steinem, an internationally recognized feminist leader, on Wednesday night in an event that covered her life as a prominent activist, a journalist and a woman living through the gender revolution.
Steinem was interviewed by David Belasco, co-director and adjunct professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The event was hosted by Program Board and sponsored by USC Visions & Voices, the USC Speakers Committee and the USC Marshall School of Business.
Belasco opened the nearly two-hour interview by asking Steinem about feminism and the long-debated and often misrepresented definition of the term amongst the public discourse.
“I don’t know how to say this, but it means what it says in the dictionary,” Steinem said. “It’s when a male or female believes in the full socio-economic, political equality and humanity of women.”
The conversation turned to Steinem’s upbringing and the realization of her feminist principles through witnessing her mother’s effort to balance career and family, all while struggling with her mental health.
“She tried to entertain her career as a journalist, she was the editor of a newspaper, but she had daughters and she had a supremely, wonderfully kind but totally irresponsible husband,” Steinem said. “But she just couldn’t do it. She suffered what they used to call a ‘nervous breakdown’ and was in a sanatorium for a couple years. She just gave it up.”
Steinem went on to describe the paralyzing effect of her mother’s predicament, contrasted with the freedom given to later generations to pursue their ambitions. In Steinem’s case, she went on to study at Smith College and began a career in journalism.
“By the time I knew her, she had given up everything she loved, everything she cared about,” Steinem said. “I became aware very early, once I became a writer, that I was living out her unlived life. There’s nothing sadder than wasted talent.”
Belasco asked Steinem to describe her switch from writer to activist, the latter of which defined her career as a symbol for the women’s liberation movement.
“I went to cover a protest over the New York legislature trying to decide whether to legalize abortion, this before the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision.” Steinem said. “So they provided 14 men and one nun to testify. I was magnetized by it.”
Steinem spoke of the galvanizing power of the protest, which stunned her as a young reporter in the 1960s.
“I heard for the first time in my life, women standing up telling the truth about something they weren’t supposed to tell the truth about, and something that only happened to women,” Steinem said.
Steinem went on to pay tribute to the fellow activists who pushed the women’s liberation movement over the decades. Steinem paid special mention to the African-American women she had worked with throughout her career, including Florynce Kennedy and Dorothy Pittman, with whom she took the now-infamous raised-fist photograph.
“Dorothy Pittman was married, she had children, she’s African American, and she’s fearless,” Steinem said. “So I asked her to come speak with me. Together we understood how important it was to be together.”
After the event, Steinem spoke on intersectional feminism and the stiff definition of feminism that continues to exclude women of color. She mentioned the biased reception of the press, which assumed a distinction between women’s struggles and the struggles of African Americans.
“It’s always been a feminist issue, and this misunderstanding has always been the same,” Steinem said. “For instance, when I was traveling with Dorothy Pittman or Flo Kennedy or Margaret Sloan, we would have a press conference after a lecture on campus. And the press would ask me about the women’s movement, and Dorothy or Flo about the civil rights movement.”
Steinem ended the conversation on an encouraging note, as she described the source of her boundless activism — the gratification of progress.
“What keeps me going is not what needs to be done, but the excitement of the ways to do it,” Steinem said. “It’s that ‘a-ha!’ moment.”

“I don’t know how to say this, but it means what it says in the dictionary,” Steinem said. “It’s when a male or female believes in the full socio-economic, political equality and humanity of women.”
Gloria Steinem silences women and gives men permission to silence women.
Steinem silenced millions of women when she participated in a discussion with bell hooks, Urvashi Vaid, and Naomi Wolf for the September/October 1993 issue of Ms. Magazine. Those four feminists discussed why women choose not to call themselves feminists instead of asking women who make that choice to speak for themselves. Would Steinem, hooks, Vaid, or Wolf have agreed that a group of nonfeminist women could speak for them to explain why they choose to call themselves feminist? 
Steinem also gives men permission to silence women. On a New York stage in 1992, Steinem said, “We don’t give a shit what she thinks” about Camille Paglia. Steinem’s statement was broadcast on 60 Minutes. On national television, Steinem gave permission to every man listening to silence any woman by saying, “I don’t give a shit what she thinks”. 
Steinem continues to silence women any time she announces that the alternative to feminism is masochism. I called myself a feminist for about 20 years. By the time of the above Ms. article, three local feminist leaders had verbally and emotionally abused me. I talked to other women and discovered the local feminist leaders had abused them as well. I decided I would be a masochist to continue associating with verbally and emotionally abusive women. I stopped calling myself a feminist. 
Gloria Steinem creates inequality between women and for women.
She also creates inequality between men and women and for men too.
She does.
Feminism is not like the civil rights movement for black americans.
Civil rights leaders did not advocate to kill unborn babies out of pure convenience
Civil rights leaders did not advocate to ban gender pronouns
Civil rights leaders did not advocate to demonize marriage and glorify sexual promiscuity
Civil rights leaders did not advocate for a completely  androgynous society
Civil rights leaders did not glorify by-choice single motherhood
Civil rights leaders did not advocate hat a mentally ill man chopping off his penis is suddenly a woman because he feels like it
Civil rights leaders did not seek to change the common sense definition of a mother,father, woman, or man.
etc.

Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, has begun holding weekly office hours this semester, dubbed “Conversations with Carry,” in an effort to increase access for students.
“My hope is that students find a value in it, come to it and get some good information, and continue in the fall,” Carry said. “I would like to have a one-day commitment every year to listen to students about anything they want to talk about.”
Last year, students from the Undergraduate Student Government and other student organizations brought up interest in talking to university administrators directly. When the idea of office hours was pitched in the meetings, it received a positive response from students in attendance.
“I wanted to create a date that is super easy for students to schedule time with me,” Carry said. To spark it off, Carry extended invitations to veterans, spring admits, members of greek letter organizations, transfer students, residential advisers, orientation leaders, tour guides, students with disabilities and international students.
So far, Carry has met with some transfer students and commuter students. According to Carry, while they generally expressed their positivity toward the University, some issues were brought up. Commuter students asked questions about places to store items for the rest of the day. The transfer students talked about the challenges around articulation agreements, with regard to transferring as many credit hours as possible from their previous institutions. Carry hopes to hear more opinions from students and wants to encourage other members of his administration to do the same.
“I would like to expand it and ask my staff to think about adding a day in which all they do is to listen to students,” Carry said. “We do attend many student meetings and meet a lot of student leaders and organizations; however, what if we created a full day when we meet with other regular students who have a tight schedule and cannot serve on student organizations?”
With his office hours, Carry hopes to increase transparency between the administration and the student body.
“I want to reduce any barriers between the University’s administration and students,” Carry said. “As my core responsibility is to students, I want to make the university’s administration acceptable to students.”
Carry chiefly wants to listen to the current successes, issues that require improvements and trending topics among the student body in order to ensure that the university’s administration stays connected to the student body.
“I wish to make sure I can reflect students’ interests appropriately to my colleagues in senior administrations,” Carry said.
Carry’s office is open to students on Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. His office is STU 201, located on the second floor of the Student Union. Both undergraduate and graduate students can sign up for office hours. Students can schedule an appointment with Carry online by filling out a sign-up form, emailing his office or walking in. Students may come individually or in small groups to talk about any topic they want for the duration of their appointment, which lasts about 30 minutes.
“The best way to do it would be to schedule it. You might have to wait extra time if you just drop in; however, if you are just in the area and decide to walk in, I would love to talk about anything,” Carry said.

The Sustainability 2020 plan was the topic of discussion at an Environmental Student Assembly open forum with Office of Sustainability Manager Halli Bovia Wednesday night in The Forum.
The Sustainability 2020 plan is an initiative launched by the University in December to reach certain environmentally conscious goals and benchmarks by 2020 in the areas of education and research, community engagement, energy conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation, sustainable transportation and procurement, waste diversion and water conservation. The plan was created after a vetting of university practices in 2013 revealed that USC lagged behind most other schools in sustainability.
“We actually achieved a rating, a bronze rating,” Bovia said. “USC is not a bronze school. Most of our peers have achieved at least silver, some gold.”
After the plan was written, Provost Michael Quick emailed a memorandum to students on Dec. 15, 2015 that outlined the goals of Sustainability 2020 to students.
When asked about the memorandum, Bovia was optimistic that the memorandum would allow students to hold the administration accountable if the goals set for the University are not reached by 2020.
“The best incentive we have is a letter from the provost, so hopefully that’s enough,” Bovia said. “It’s encouraging because we’ve never had a letter from the provost.”
However, some students, such as Ailish Ullmann, a sophomore majoring in environmental science and health, are still confused why USC is lagging behind other universities when it comes to making environmentalism a major campus priority.
“Why is the administration dragging their feet to be a leader in sustainability? Because I feel like every time I hear about this it’s ‘USC wants to be a leader in this’ and ‘USC wants to be a leader in that’ and then there’s nothing,” Ullmann said.
Major issues that Bovia noted were the high costs associated with sustainability and how the university’s buildings are designed, which makes it difficult to implement practices such as placing solar panels around campus that would benefit the environment.
“I think the real issue right now is cost,” Bovia said. “[The university is] not going to put solar panels everywhere because they have an aesthetic issue with that, which is too bad, and they keep designing the buildings to not take them.”
In addition to the environmental benefits, Bovia said that part of the goal of the Sustainability 2020 plan is to help the university become more of a “living laboratory”, or a place where students and faculty can experiment to utilize what they’re learning in the classroom on campus.
“[The living laboratory] is the idea of connecting students and faculty to real-life applications of what they’re studying on the campus, such as creating a solar-powered car,” Bovia said. “Using the campus as a living laboratory to understand energy use for buildings, water use for buildings, is important. This is not something that USC culture really has right now.”
When asked about other more collaborative sustainability plans that are occurring within the Pac-12 as well as on a national scale, Bovia responded that the University has a tendency to solve these kinds of problems internally rather than partner up.
“USC doesn’t like to be a joiner,” Bovia said. “They’re more inclined to invent things themselves, to create a new system.”
But overall, Bovia reaffirmed her belief that the Sustainability 2020 plan is the right move for the University and will go a long way toward making USC a more environmentally friendly university.
“This plan is not perfect,” Bovia said. “This is the right plan for USC right now.”

The newly initiated Transfer Student Community hopes to bridge the gap between transfer students and the USC community at large. In a process that started in Fall 2015, transfer student and senior business administration major Nicole Daviau, founded the Transfer Student Community as an official club at USC on the first day of the semester.
Daviau explained her experiences as a transfer student and the large gap in services and recognition for transfer students on campus.
“I was a lost spring transfer admit. Basically my whole first year I was trying to navigate resources on my own,” Daviau said. “You don’t get any specialty treatment … It is an unmet need on campus. here I am two years in. I am just starting to get what USC is about and I have to leave.”
Daviau said that many opportunities for transfer students to succeed are squandered by the rocky transition from their previous institutions to USC. Transfer students have for a long time struggled to fit into the academic and social fabric of USC. They arrive on campus after the traditional freshmen arrive from the high school classroom.
Daviau hopes to transform the Transfer Student Community into an organization which can begin to address the issues and serve as a proper forum for a problem-free transition to USC. Currently, the group is ramping up both faculty and student support.
“There are a few supporters, —Karios Llobrera and Lena Njoku— in academic counseling services … I reached out to [Assistant Vice Provost] David Glasgow and will be meeting in the next few weeks,” Daviau said. “In past events, we couldn’t get large enough facilities or enough food. I look at it as a ground-breaking semester.”
The Transfer Student Community hopes to address key issues faced by transfer students on campus.
“I spend lots of time in between classes just wandering around.” Daviau said. “[Resources on campus such as TransferMation] do spring admit and transfer mixers and things like that but most transfers arrive at eight am and leave at six, when most of these events are in the evenings.”
Jordan Lachica, a junior transfer student majoring business administration, found the community’s aid in networking and guidance in the benefits of the new Transfer Student Commuity.
“Socializing with other transfers and finding your way through campus, navigating the resources, would be a benefit of the [Transfer Student Community],” Lachica said.
Daviau said that a lounge and lockers are needed for transfer students. As Daviau explained, to travel home for lunch is simply a luxury that many transfer students, and often times commuters, simply don’t have. Daviau said the goal is for the Transfer Student Community to have flexible meeting times which cater to transfer student schedules on campus.

Questions surrounded the USC Trojans’ recruiting class coming into National Signing Day Wednesday with seven unfulfilled scholarships, but Clay Helton and his staff closed strong, filling all seven slots with talented recruits, including three whom they “flipped” from other schools.
Prized recruit after prized recruit signed with USC, which finished with the 11th best recruiting class in the nation, according to Scout.com. Perhaps more impressively, the Men of Troy have the highest average prospect rating at 3.9 stars, according to Scout.com.
Helton lauded his recruiting staff for their efforts in nabbing a strong recruiting class.
“I have to commend this staff,” he said. “I can’t tell you how hard they worked down the stretch. It was tireless, it was relentless. They just wouldn’t take, ‘No’ for an answer. You’re not going to win every battle, but we looked up today and we were so proud of how we finished.”
The day began on an unexpected high for the Trojans, as a pair of four-star recruits flipped their commitments from other schools to USC.
Jamel Cook, a 6’5” safety, originally committed to Florida State, but will instead head across the country to Los Angeles. Cook is ranked as the No. 2 athlete in the recruiting class by 247Sports, and his size allows him to be versatile in playing both safety and cornerback.
“[Cook is] of hardest hitting young men that I’ve seen in a long, long time,” Helton said. “His length and his range to be able to cover the field was something that really jumped out on film.”
An hour later, the Trojans stole another recruit, this time from conference foe Oregon. Vavae Malepeai, out of Hawaii, where he is the state’s all-time leading rusher, flipped from the Ducks to the Trojans and will look to make an impact in a backfield led by freshman Ronald Jones II.
“He is dynamic not only as a runner, but what really stood out to us was his ability to route run in the passing game and the terrific ball skills that he is,” Helton said on Malepeai. “He is an elite runner and an elite receiver out of the backfield.”
Then, four-star defensive end Connor Murphy chose USC over Michigan, Arizona State, Alabama and Oregon. The younger brother of Redskins linebacker Trent Murphy, the product of Brophy College Prep in Arizona will bolster a Trojans’ defensive line that is losing five members to graduation.
The defensive front was boosted further by the addition of Joshua Fatu, one of the top defensive tackles in the junior college ranks. Fatu also flipped his commitment to come to the Trojans, spurning Boise State. The three-star recruit is a sophomore at Long Beach City College.
The Men of Troy added another versatile athlete in Keyshawn “Pie” Young out of Miami High in Florida. Like Adoree’ Jackson, Young can play wide receiver, defensive back and return kicks. He chose USC over Alabama, Michigan, LSU and Louisville, and it will be interesting if the Trojans choose to utilize Young in all three phases like Jackson.
Continuing its success in plucking recruits from out-of-state, the Trojans next swooped Georgia product E.J. Price, a four-star offensive tackle, away from Georgia and Auburn.
Price’s signing symbolized the reach that USC has both academically and athletically, even for a top recruit in an SEC hotbed.
“[Price is] of the premier tackles in the country,” Helton said. “It is a sign of how powerful USC is. I was very proud of him to recognize what a USC education means for him in the future.”
To wrap things up, the Trojans landed a prized defensive back in five-star recruit Jack Jones. Ranked the second best cornerback in the nation by Rivals, Jones hails from Long Beach Poly, the same high school that current freshman cornerback Iman Marshall attended. Jones, too, draws comparisons to Jackson as a speedster who can contribute on offense and special teams along with defense.
In all, the Trojans landed one five-star, four four-star and two three-star recruits Wednesday. Nine total recruits are from out-of-state, which Helton admitted was a risk that brought high rewards.
“If you want to be the best, you have to take a shot at the best,” Helton said. “If you look at the elite players, they are far away. Not only was it worth the fight because of talent, but we felt there was a special relationship with those young men, and they understood the power of USC.”
Coming into the day, the Trojans had 13 commitments out of 20 spots, headlined by five-star defensive end Oluwole Betiku out of Junipero Serra High School in Gardena and a native of Nigeria.
Out of the 13 recruits, seven are registered for classes and only one, Betiku, was brought in by Helton; the rest committed when Steve Sarkisian was still the head coach.
USC landed commitments from a number of four-star recruits prior to signing day: offensive linemen Frank Martin and Nathan Smith, wide receivers Josh Imatorbhebhe, Michael Pittman, Trevon Sidney and Tyler Vaughns, defensive back C.J. Pollard and tight end Carey Angeline.
Matt Fink, an Under Armour All-American out of nearby Glendora High, is the lone quarterback in this recruiting class. Fink will join fourth-year junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold in the battle to take over for Cody Kessler.
Wide receiver Velus Jones, defensive end Liam Jimmons and linebacker Jordan Iosefa are three-star recruits, with placekicker Michael Brown being brought in as a blueshirt.
The Trojans also lost out on a few targets before Wednesday. Four-star defensive tackle Keyshon Camp decommitted from USC last week and instead signed with Pittsburgh. Maxs Tupai, a four-star defensive end and Rashan Gary, a defensive tackle and top recruit in the nation, eliminated the Trojans from their lists earlier this week, while four-star safety Brandon Burton — whom USC jumped in late on — committed to UCLA Tuesday.
On Wednesday, USC wound up with far more hits than misses, but were not picked by a few targets in defensive end Jonathan Kongbo, tight end Devin Asiasi and defensive tackle Boss Tagaloa.

USC basketball is already off to its best start in more than 20 years though Thursday’s crosstown showdown at the Galen Center could prove to be a monumental night for the direction of the program when it comes to pitting itself against its perennial rivals. At the surface, the Trojans have a chance to capture a season series over UCLA for the first time since 2010, which would mark only the fourth time they have accomplished that feat since 2000.
A second win over the Bruins in 2016 would not only give the Trojans the temporary title of the collegiate basketball team that runs L.A, but it could also signal an unofficial changing of the guard of the program that holds this distinction moving forward.
This notion has come into fruition relatively quickly and even more unexpectedly — UCLA was an NCAA Sweet 16 team last season, while the Trojans lost all but three conference games. The difference in just a year is obvious. What it has come down to, though, is the overall cohesion of each team’s young talent.
The ultimate difference has been the contrasting offensive styles for both teams. The Trojans play like more of a unified front, spreading the floor and finding each other for open shots in third-year head coach Andy Enfield’s run ‘n gun system. Meanwhile under Steve Alford, the Bruins seem to rely more on isolation play from its top scorers. This was apparent in the teams’ first meeting at Pauley Pavilion earlier this season when USC dominated the Bruins on its way to an 89-75 victory — a possible indicator of things to come.
Taking a step back and looking at the Trojans and Bruins’ current rosters side-by-side, both teams are incredibly young and feature only one graduating senior — USC’s Strahinja Gavrilovic and UCLA starting center Tony Parker. The rest of their rosters feature a group of juniors that are expected to be back next year, along with a fresh bundle of established freshmen and sophomores.
Accordingly, it appears that both programs are at similar points in the life cycle of a college basketball program, but their respective directions are not quite the same.
It’s a known fact that the Trojans are on the rise. They’ve won 13 consecutive home games to start the season, recently jumped back into the national rankings for the first time since 2008 and currently sit in the top three of the Pac-12 standings. Even with a skilled group of young players, UCLA’s future doesn’t seem as discernible as USC’s. The Bruins resume this season features a road victory at Gonzaga and quality wins at home over Kentucky and Arizona, which are ranked 19th and 20th, respectively, in the USA Today Coaches Poll. They have struggled, however, to find a groove in conference play, falling into the bottom half of the standings halfway through Pac-12 play.
Remember that both Enfield and Alford arrived at their respective Los Angeles-based programs at the same time. Their first two years were on opposite ends of the spectrum, but by bringing in some top recruits and simply by being patient, it’s now Enfield that has given his program the more promising feature. USC’s core group of players just seem to gel better than those of the Bruins and that’s a positive sign moving forward, as the Trojans try to continue to assert their superiority in hoops — for now.
Don’t get me wrong, neither school is going to forget its roots. USC will always be a football-first school and UCLA will always pride itself on its rich basketball history.
Every now and then, though, the tides change. Before this past season, UCLA had USC’s number on the gridiron, winning three consecutive crosstown rivalry games to start making people think that the Bruins are now becoming the “football school” in Los Angeles.
USC still has a long way to go before actually becoming the go-to basketball school in Los Angeles, but a win on Thursday night will solidify its dominance for the time being.

After downing the UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion for the first time in three years, the Trojans now have a chance to maintain home and crosstown-cup perfection at the Galen Center for the second act of the USC and UCLA showdown.
The 17-5 Trojans, coming off two straight 10-point wins against Washington State and Washington at home, are on the upswing after losing two games against Oregon and Oregon State on their most recent road trip.
On the other hand, the 13-9 Bruins have been struggling recently, losing three of their last five games to USC, Oregon and Washington while allowing an average of 76.8 points per game.
In the first game of the crosstown rivalry, the Men of Troy easily handled the Bruins 89-75, despite a deafening crowd of 12,993 at Pauley Pavilion.
“Bryce Alford is really good,” redshirt junior Katin Reinhardt said. “Last game he didn’t get anything going. We’ve got to make sure we contain him again as well as Tony Parker.”
During the contest, the Trojans executed precise outside shooting from their guards, equal distribution inside and out and big plays inside the paint from their forwards.
Sophomores Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart were dynamite for USC, converting seven of their 10 three-point attempts, with McLaughlin going for a team-high 23 points on 50 percent shooting.
As for the Trojan bigs, freshman Chimezie Metu and junior Nikola Jovanovic helped USC to out-rebound UCLA, combining for 14 of 42 rebounds, while scoring 21 and eight points, respectively. Not to mention, Metu and Jovanovic completed nine of their 12 free-throw attempts, helping USC shoot 78.3 percent overall from the line.
In terms of what the Trojans’ defense was able to do against the Bruins, UCLA completed just four of its 19 three-point attempts with their bench accumulating just two points off of four free throws while missing all of their eight shots from the field.
As well, the Trojans earned four steals and caused the Bruins to turn the ball over nine times.
Moving on from their 14-point win, though, the Trojans have been playing better quality basketball after their two losses in Oregon due to a combination of their interior offense and exterior defense.
A resurgent Jovanovic has stepped up his play in recent games, shooting a combined 16-23 in his past two games with 12 rebounds, 40 points, two assists and a 88.9 percent free-throw percentage after scoring just 13 points combined in the Trojans’ losses to Oregon and Oregon State.
If the Men of Troy hope to keep their 13-0 record at home untarnished, the 6-feet-11 Jovanovic will have to play consistently on the offensive glass, grabbing offensive rebounds, while contributing hook shots and layups on the scorecard.
Not to mention, the Trojans have been dominating in terms of pushing teams inside due to their stringy outside defense. Considering the correlation between opposing 3-point percentage and overall outcome for the Trojans, USC will need to lock down the perimeter and force UCLA shooters inside the arch.
In the Trojans’ two wins against Washington State and Washington, the Cougars and Huskies each shot 22.2 and 25 percent from 3-point range, respectively. In USC’s win at Pauley Pavilion, the Trojans held the Bruins to just 21.1 percent from beyond the arch, leading to a 14-point drubbing.
“Our goal all year has been to challenge the 3-point shooter and try to run them off the line,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We’ve been doing a pretty good job at holding teams to moderate or low percentage from the 3 line all season, but you never know. UCLA has great shooters from the perimeter.”
Despite a shaky 2-2 record in their last four games, the Bruins are shooting 36.3 percent from beyond the arch, much improved from their loss to USC.
Overall, though, reducing Alford, Isaac Hamilton, Parker and Aaron Holiday is imperative to a Trojan victory, ultimately crowd support could determine the result of Thursday’s contest.
Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. at the Galen Center.

The reason people are so fascinated with the Ivy League is similar to the reason why people are so enamored by celebrities today. The sense of mystery that surrounds the elite and wealthy tends to draw much intrigue from people who live ordinarily and aspire to live vicariously through them. For self-proclaimed college nerd Sean-Michael Green, the captivation of the eight most prestigious East Coast universities is not fixated on what one might think. While he acknowledges that the academic excellence and long-standing history of the campus is very appealing, his main interest is on student life. Ridiculous rumors about these colleges circulate all around the globe, things like — you must be either related to the President or have had a family member donate a new building or have immeasurable wealth to be deemed worthy. In The Things I Learned in College Green investigates to what extent that these speculations are actually true. He joined the freshman at Cornell in August and ends with graduation at Princeton in May.
The book chronicles Green’s intriguing journey of visiting each institution for 30 days. He stayed in dorms with students, attended classes, got access to frat parties and immersed himself in the whirlwind of being a student in some of the country’s most selective schools. While  there are many stereotypes about Ivy Leagues, the author quickly discovers that while some assumptions about are true, the students are more than the shallow and privileged “party-obsessed monsters armed with fake IDs and moms’ credit cards” that everyone loves to hate.
Green’s observations are insightful and witty as he navigates the campuses, leaving pieces of his heart in each one. Although he dines with faculty members, commenting on their sharp minds and friendly demeanor, it is apparent that he values the social scene more than academics. He manages to make astute remarks on the events that unfold, pointing out the lack of diversity in greek life and many instances of discrimination that not only face Ivy League colleges, but all colleges on a daily basis. For instance, he mentions a conversation he has with a sorority girl that did not accept an African- American girl into their sorority, saying “The black girls who rushed us just weren’t very attractive. And we had an Asian member, I think.”
While Green had no intention of focusing on social issues, stating that this was all a “silly project,” he recognizes that many of the problems arise on their own. He noticed that a Korean-American named Kevin was the only Asian male at the fraternity party and felt that he had to “prove” himself by drinking more than the other members. One of the other members said that he wanted to create a stereotype of Asians as quick drinkers.
Another reason besides the infamous social scene of choosing an Ivy League school is for the recognition and respect that comes with it. He states that once a school’s name like Harvard or Yale is mentioned, many will automatically assume that the person is extremely wealthy, hardworking or intelligent.
As someone who had almost flunked out of high school, Sean-Michael Green inspiringly pursued his love for education and is now a senior administrator of University of New Haven and is a graduate of Cornell Law School. His passion for schools extends beyond just high-status universities and says that he is “passionate about learning among the brightest and most ambitious in their fields” but this type of person “is also present at other highly selective institutions.”
Sean-Michael Green recalls many shocking and intriguing events in a thoughtful and light-hearted way, treating Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale like old friends. For anyone who has always been curious about life at these eight prominent universities or are just interested in reading a one-of-a-kind story, The Things I Learned in College is definitely one to try.
The Things I Learned in College will come out on April 12. USC Students who are interested in pre-ordering the novel should email  presale@seanmichaelgreen.com with their USC email for a special deal.
Daily Trojan: It says in the last chapter of the novel that it was a ten-year journey. But, you said that it took you one year to explore all the colleges.
SMG: I actually did everything 10 years ago, but I never ended up writing the book until last year. The reason for my 10-year hiatus was that it was a project that was so emotionally difficult. I would go to every college for only 30 days, and I would make friends and establish connections and then it would be time to move on, and I was just so tired. When I came back I fell right into work, and I got back to life, and there was just not enough time to go back to it. And recently; I was convinced to write the book again.
DT: Do you feel that since the project was so long ago, it would interfere with how you remembered situations and events? Or do you think that the extra time allowed you to marinate your feelings and thoughts?
SMG: I don’t feel like the time made any difference. I kept a lot of notes. I had a separate notebook for every school. I also kept in touch with a lot of people from all the colleges. I had people from each school read the book and edit it for me and tell me their thoughts. Each chapter is about 25 to 30 pages long. Every hour that I was at school, I was doing stuff. I had to edit out a bunch of information. In some places, more things happened. There wasn’t a lot of stuff happening but I could write just about three books about just Dartmouth, Cornell, and Columbia alone. In Cornell, since it was my alma mater, I was excited and energetic. I felt like a college student going through his freshman to senior year. By the time I got to the last Ivy, I felt like I was a senior, and I was ready for graduation.
DT: I’ve noticed in your writing that you have very specific descriptions on parties, frats and students but your descriptions on things like eating with faculty or academics were not as detailed in comparison. Why do you think that is?
SMG: That’s really interesting that you ask that because I hadn’t noticed that I did that. But now that I think of it, the book reflects the truth that my main interest is in the students. I’m not that interested in professors or the buildings. The students are what the universities are about. The students are what the Ivy Leagues are about. I think that what you’re seeing is how the Ivy League is through my subjective lens.
DT: Since you’ve been to so many universities and have seen firsthand the unique characteristics of each and obviously value more selective universities, what would you say to people who tell others that they are “not defined by your college?” To what extent do you think this is true?
SMG: Well, I’ve had experiences in many different types of colleges and I have to tell you that they are all completely different. I’ve been to community college, University of Pittsburgh, and Cornell University. The location and resources that each university has is definitely not the same. When I was in community college, the environment that you’re in and the people you’re surrounded by are completely different. For instance, Harvard’s endowment right now is over $30 billion. If you need access for a lab or if you want to go to a trip around the world, then it would definitely be easier to make it happen. Money is one measure, but a lot of other factors impact what life is like at a school.

For the fourth year in a row, visual art is commemorated in book form at the LA Art Book Fair. Created to showcase the works of independent publishers and artists in a bazaar set-up, this event is set to attract the most creative vendors and enthusiasts to The Geffen Contemporary at the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Last year the  event, the West Coast equivalent to its New York counterpart, attracted more than 34,000 patrons. At the rate the event is growing in Los Angeles, this year’s fair promises to push the boundaries of conventional visual presentation with its exhibitions and events.
One would find navigating the web of stations captivating. Exhibits throughout the event are hosted by vendors from an array of different countries. Australian bookstore Heavytime Books — slated to showcase items at the event — boasts of controversial merchandise in which “reader discretion is advised.” Independent Chinese photo art publishing house Jiazazhi facilitates more than 10 publications, all of which explore photo expression. In Timekeepers, for example, photographer Matjaz Tancic captures the lives of peasants in rural China. The fair excels at representing art from many areas of the world.
While the event is spotlighting most vendors from all over the United States, many are based in California. Not only are area museums such as the Hammer Museum and Los Angeles County Museum of Art making an appearance, but independent operations have a chance to present their work as well. LAND AND SEA, an Oakland, Calif. press shop, will debut artist Jason Mcafee’s WILD HORSES. Modern Women, a local print shop, concentrates on feminist gear. However, expect to see exhibitors from other states at the LA Art Book Fair as well.
Other than meandering around MOCA, the book fair has a number of scheduled readings, panels and discussions. Author Bill Burns is slated to read from his memoir, Hans Ulrich Obrist Hear Us, which details the economy of art. The #BlackLivesMatter movement will conduct an artistic demonstration during the three-day duration.
A full list of exhibits and events can be found online. LA Art Book Fair is free to the public and takes place from Feb. 12-14, though tickets for the preview are on sale now.

No one wants to be called a bad anything, let alone a bad feminist.
It’s easy to straddle the moral high horse when reading or writing about feminism. Denouncing others’ actions for the sake of women’s rights comes quickly to most females, considering the injustices we go through — from the pain of high heels to the real risk of being murdered after rejecting a man. Despite those inherent flaws, few feminists would call themselves out on this bias.
Roxane Gay is not most feminists.
Let’s be real: no one wants to be called a bad anything, except maybe “badgalriri” Rihanna and Gay, the author of the best-selling book Bad Feminist.
I admit that I bristled at the title of Gay’s book, which is a collection of essays, when I first came across it. This was back in 2014, when “feminism” first became a buzzword and Gone Girl was everyone’s favorite new subversive movie. Cool Girl speech, anyone?
In Bad Feminist, every reader will find an unlikely new protagonist. Gay pushes the truth to its breaking point, and then pushes some more. It might be more appropriate to call her the antihero.
“These essays are political and they are personal,” Gay writes in the introduction to Bad Feminist. “They are, like feminism, flawed, but they come from a genuine place.”
I love Bad Feminist because Gay is, at the end of the day, a human being, and she is not afraid to show it. She’s problematic at times, witty and self-deprecating at others and a reality TV junkie always. She does not shy away from the ugly truth that there is no such thing as the perfect feminist. Despite cries for intersectionality and acceptance, unlearning ingrained stereotypes is a constant uphill battle. Bad Feminist tells the reader that it’s okay to want to give up sometimes.
In Bad Feminist, Gay takes on white feminism, which is inherently exclusionary for all it claims not to be. Gay also takes on blackness in pop culture. “There is not enough height in the atmosphere for us to suspend our disbelief […] My real problem is that The Help is written by a white woman,” she so scathingly writes. As for Django Unchained, this is what Gay had to say: “My slavery revenge fantasy would probably involve being able to read and write without fear of punishment or persecution coupled with a long vacation in Paris.”
Gay lays herself bare and is mostly unapologetic for it. Calling herself a bad feminist allows Gay a freedom most modern feminists aren’t allowed: the ability to be wrong and admit it.
For those who enjoy Bad Feminist, some other feminist reads you can check out are You Don’t Have to Like Me: Essays on Growing Up, Speaking Out and Finding Feminism by Alida Nugent and The Feminist Utopia Project by Rachel Kauder Nalebuff and Alexandra Brodsky.

In a trailer for Neighbors 2, a sorority leader explains to a potential new member that in the United States, sororities are not allowed to throw parties within their chapter houses while fraternities can.
In retaliation, the protagonist, played by Chloë Grace Mortez, starts her own sorority to combat how “sexist and restrictive” the greek system is. It’s absurd that the greek system is circuited so often throughout the media because of its recurrent inequalities, but then again, the greek system itself truly is ridiculous.
So why is it that fraternities can have parties, ill-intended ones to say the least, while sororities can’t? It sounds like a possible solution to the ongoing sexual harassment women experience. Maybe women would be safer partying in their own homes rather than at a frat house.
Houses perpetuate a sense of superiority, exclusion and racism. But let’s not forget about the internalized misogyny, the absolute overtone of sexism and gender inequality, and the continued homogenous existence of fraternities that, as a TIME article put it, “normalize a kind of white, male-dominated culture.”
Especially among frat houses, sexual assault and harrassment are like a bright red stain on white carpet. A “brother” can try repeatedly to get the stain out, scrub as hard as he can and even go as far as to cover it, but that stain won’t be going away any time soon. So how can one prevent the stain altogether? At a fraternity party, it’s safe to assume that a woman within the fraternity house is at risk of some sort of sexual harassment. According to the Washington Post, an estimated “40 percent of sorority sisters surveyed said they had been subjected to rape or attempted rape,” while a shocking “48 percent reported that they experienced nonconsensual sexual contact.”
With the constant perpetuation of sexism, whether through the exclusiveness of which girls are allowed in or the themed parties such as “Tennis Pros and Country Club Hoes,” there’s an expectation at these parties that fraternity brothers are “going to get some.”
Gender inequality persists within the house and that men feel superior to the women in attendance. In a TIME article, Jessica Bennett explained that, “if we lived in a gender-equal world, fraternities might work.” There’s a complete disregard to the worth and well-being of women and a definite implication of degradation toward the women who attend these parties, whether it be in who’s allowed to attend or what they’re wearing to promote the night’s themed party.
So the dance floor evolves into a hunting ground and men prey on unsuspecting women. And while a Guardian writer points out that “not all men who join frats (or varsity sports teams) are predators,” it’s important to note the amount of sexual violence that occurs in an average woman’s college career. It’s reported that one in five college women are sexually assaulted on campus. With numbers so high, it seems irresponsible to keep greek life going, especially without supervision.
These frat parties are fun when women aren’t being sexually harassed. These frat parties are fun when everyone returns home safely. And these frat parties are especially fun when a tearful girl doesn’t have to turn to her friend and explain, “It happened again last night.”
Though the idea seems innocent enough, a 1998 decision by the National Panhellenic Conference (which governs 26 sororities) made it clear that sorority houses prohibit alcohol consumption, which happens to be a catalyst to non-consensual activity. It seems illogical and counterproductive to enforce a rule as outdated as this one, especially knowing that fraternity men are three times more likely to initiate rape than other college men, according to a SAGE Publications study.
If sororities can’t hold their own parties while fraternities can, the cycle of sexual assault seems never-ending. The only logical way to really enforce sexual assault prevention  — because for some reason, some people don’t understand that no means no — might be to eliminate greek life altogether. The suggestion is drastic, but could be the key to putting an end to sexual exploitation. Though the thought probably makes greek-goers angry, it’s an effective move in the right direction.
Banishment is the tactic of choice preferred by cowards and weaklings.

These days, considering the astronomical amount of information it has on you, chances are, your search engine has achieved creeper status. It probably knows the stores you frequent, the restaurants you’ve scanned Yelp for — and maybe even a few medical issues. At IBM, inventor James Kozloski recently filed a patent for technology that takes things a bit further. Though its premise sounds a little too close for comfort, at its heart, this innovation holds promise for a greater good.
A system that The Atlantic dubbed a “search engine for your memories,” the patent outlines a real-time cognitive assistant that will essentially “help finish your sentences for you.”
“The idea is quite simple,” Kozloski told The Atlantic. “You monitor an individual’s context, whether it’s what they’re saying or what they’re doing … and you predict what comes next.”
In a nutshell, it’s a model for the human memory, prompting the user when necessary to fill in missing information, be it an elusive name or a birthday. It operates by way of machine learning, surveillance and predictive modeling.
As a radical version of the search engine, this technology inevitably faces privacy concerns. Major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! monitor search histories and draw personal profiles. As a result, ranks of alternative engines such as DuckDuckGo and StartPage that don’t track any personal information, have emerged. On Jan. 6, British company Oscobo launched an anonymous search engine of the same name in the U.K.
“I saw firsthand how the industry is collecting data, and I became increasingly uncomfortable with what the industry was doing with personal data,” Oscobo cofounder Fred Cornell, a former Yahoo employee, told tech site Alphr. “That’s publishers, advertisers, ad exchanges, data traders — everyone’s at it. Everyone wants to collect more data and make more money from it.”
But while a personalized search engine for your memories might sound too futuristic, the reality is, the so-called future is the present. We already have devices that listen to us and monitor our every move, from Siri and Fitbit wristbands to Amazon Echo and Microsoft’s intelligent personal assistant Cortana. As of November 2015, WiFi-enabled Barbie dolls can now hold conversations with children using speech recognition.
The list continues, so why not use this new, more intimate technology for good? IBM’s search engine would do just that, tapping into innovation with a compassionate cause in mind. It aims to help the elderly, especially those who suffer from memory loss. For instance, if an Alzheimer’s patient dials her daughter, the cognitive assistant will know to prompt her with, say, her daughter’s husband’s name as well, especially if it knows, based on past interactions, that during this specific time, he’s more likely to pick up the phone. In addition, it could provide caregivers with an idea of which tasks are forgotten most often or help physicians track the duration and severity of the cognitive impairment.
Though such technology still falls short of a cure, it is clearly a step forward in making life more manageable for those with Alzheimer’s and other memory-related diseases.
“The Lost Mariner,” an essay published in 1985 by neurologist Oliver Sacks, illustrates the benefits best.
In the case history, Sacks’ patient, Jimmie G., is a victim of Karsakoff’s syndrome who remembers nothing of life after 1945. Sacks struggles to find a way to help Jimmie, this man who has lost his roots, connect back to life. He wonders despairingly, “But how could he connect, and how could we help him to connect? What was life without connection?”
At that point in time, Sacks was at a loss — but if it were today, the answer could very well be at his fingertips.
