Replacing All-Pac-10 forward Nikola Vucevic — the 16th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft — will not be the USC men’s basketball team’s only challenge this season.
Tough act to follow · Sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon (right) is expected to replace former forward Nikola Vucevic’s at forward. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The Trojans, who began official practice last Friday, are missing several key players because of various injuries.
Senior guard Jio Fontan, who suffered an ACL tear during the exhibition games in Brazil, and sophomore forward Curtis Washington, who has a torn labrum, are not practicing, and both players could be sidelined the entire season.
Sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, who sustained a non-displaced fracture of his right hand, was limited but practiced with a large cast, and will likely be available when the Trojans open their season at home against Cal State Northridge on Nov. 11.
“Injuries are a part of the game,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We have to move forward.”
Fontan, who led USC in assists and finished second in scoring last season, was expected to provide leadership as the only eligible senior on scholarship.
Sophomore guard Maurice Jones who started alongside Fontan for much of last season, is expected to slide over to play point guard. The Trojans will also rely on 6-foot-2 freshman guard Alexis Moore, from Long Beach, Calif. The only other guards on scholarship are Greg Allen, a transfer from Navarro College, and Byron Wesley, a freshman from Etiwanda High School.
“It gives another guy the chance to step up,” O’Neill said.
Washington, who played sparingly last season and did not score a point, was expected to provide depth in the frontcourt. In his absence, the Trojans will count on junior center James Blasczyk, a transfer from Lee College, and redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, who transferred from Iowa, in addition to Dedmon.
Dedmon is practicing, although the large cast on his right hand prevents him from shooting the ball. Trainers covered the cast with bubble wrap and tape so it would be safe enough to play with.
“It is like playing with a boxing glove,” Dedmon said. “It is hard but you have to make do.”
Other minor injuries include Fuller’s dislocated finger, but it has not caused him to miss any practice time.
“He has not said a word, and that is what I like about [Fuller],” O’Neill said. “You are not supposed to sit on the side with the sniffles.”
Jones has been bothered by a minor ankle injury. He has not been sidelined, but O’Neill stated he might rest Jones at times because he is valuable to the team.
“The crippling injury would be to [Jones],” O’Neill said. “If [he] gets hurt, I am in front of a bus.”
With Fontan out, Jones, who averaged 9.9 points per game last season, and sophomore forward Garrett Jackson, who contributed an average of 3.2 points per game, are the only two returning players to score for the Trojans last season.
O’Neill, however, insists he won’t use the numerous injuries to key players as an excuse for any potential obstacles this season.
“Basketball is full of challenges, especially the situation we took over,” O’Neill said. “We have to endure a few more bumps in the road, and we will do that.”

Arik Armstead, USC’s top recruit for its 2012 football recruiting class and brother of current USC senior defensive end Armond Armstead, has rescinded his verbal commitment to USC, according to a Scout.com report.
The Elk Grove, Calif., native and Pleasant Grove High School star is Scout’s top overall recruit for the class of 2012 listed as an offensive tackle. Rivals.com — another leading scouting website — listed the younger Armstead as the 26th overall recruit as a defensive end — reportedly his prefered position.
“It’s a big factor, wherever I go, that I want to play defense,” Armstead told Scout analyst Brandon Huffman. “So schools recruiting me for offense, they can do that, but they’ll be hard to consider.”
Armond Armstead did not receive medical clearance from USC’s medical staff after being hospitalized for an undisclosed condition in March and will not play this season, which factored into Arik Armstead’s decision to decommit.
“I’ve been disappointed with the way some of the things have been handled with the school and my family over the last six months,” the younger Armstead told Huffman.
Huffman reports Armstead will visit Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., this weekend, where the Fighting Irish are set to host USC.
According to Huffman’s report, other teams interested in Armstead include Michigan, California and Alabama.
Seeing Aaron Lynch make Barkley run for his life this weekend (as a Freshman) should put a smile on Arik’s (and my) face!
GO IRISH!
Go Irish. It is a no lose situation. Win and we demonstrate we are superior on the football field as well. Lose and we are still superior in ethics, academics and morals
Eat it, eat it hard.  Your time in the sun is done. You had a squeeky clean decade of dominance, be proud of that.  Oh wait…
Why is an idiot Irish little man getting the Daily Trojan on e-mail. ? Typical insecure person having nothing to say.
There was a link to the story on NDnation about a ND recruit. Don’t worry SC isn’t big enough to troll, you’re not ND.
Just checking outthe enemy. Classless USC, as usual
EAT IT TROJANS

Mid-October has become something of a bright spot for the Trojans in recent years.
For the last three seasons, the early breaths of fall have ushered in an always crucial bye week and a matchup against California to round out the first half of USC’s football schedule.
This has only become special because of what the Trojans have made of it: USC has outscored Cal 108-26 in three blowouts since 2009, and each year has countered its lack of depth by using the bye weeks to rest an injury-ravaged roster.
The combination of the two events in back-to-back weeks (the bye came after the Cal game in 2009 and 2010, but before it this season) has time-and-again put USC on a temporary high entering the second half of the season, seemingly reinvigorating a team fans have been waiting to return to form for quite some time.
At this point last season and the season before it, morale had reached a peak, optimism was overflowing and the thought on everyone’s minds was not of the losses suffered earlier in the season, but rather of the resounding strides the team had made in just a few short weeks.
But with most parties come the inevitable hangover, and the previous two seasons have served as hard evidence that the success of a couple weeks isn’t enough to carry a team through the rest of its schedule. The Trojans’ late-season losses in 2009 and 2010 were particularly painful because of this trend, as inflated expectations from midseason left many wondering where the team went wrong.
I admit I’ve fallen victim to these visions of grandeur in the past, just like so many others. It’s hard not to think it’s just a matter of putting the right pieces together before the Trojans are nationally relevant again.
This is why, as this period of positivity has once again arrived for the Trojans, it is more important than ever for USC to take last Thursday’s game as nothing more than a win, and move on.
USC’s youth is no secret, and with a lack of experience comes a higher chance of emotions finding their way to the field. Young starters on both sides of the ball have made waves at times this season, but have also proved to be susceptible to negative conditions and opponents’ momentum.
The Trojans will be playing three of their remaining six games on the road, two of which — Notre Dame and Oregon — will take place in raucous environments against strong teams vying for a BCS bid. Add to that games against Andrew Luck-led Stanford and underrated Washington, and it is clear USC has no time to rejoice about its previous triumphs.
It is also important to keep the recent play of the defense in perspective. Forcing five turnovers in a game is not necessarily impressive for the Trojans. Not only did Cal still put up more yards in the game than USC, but the majority of them — 294 — came from the very man responsible for most of those giveaways — quarterback Zach Maynard.
Though Maynard has been a bright spot for the Golden Bears this season, he is nowhere near the caliber of quarterback that have recently defined the Pac-12. USC has already struggled against Arizona State’s Brock Osweiler and Arizona’s Nick Foles, so until it can hold serve against a dynamic quarterback like Luck or Oregon’s Darron Thomas, this squad’s progression can’t be truly measured.
It makes sense to use previous wins to keep players happy and confident. But this warning comes in regard to the emotions that arise beyond that, which can make a team lose focus of the game plan that has brought it success in the past.
The point might be dampening and a bit cynical. But by avoiding assumptions, expectations and the highlight reels of the last weeks, the Trojans will put themselves in a better position to finally realize the success they’ve desired for so long.

Six years later, USC freshman tailback George Farmer still recalls the day he came home from middle school to find a special visitor at his door.
Nightmare matchup · In season debut for USC last Thursday, freshman tailback George Farmer caught one pass for 14 yards and added another four yards on four carries on the road at California. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“It was Reggie Bush, the Trojans’ running back I had been watching on TV for years,” said Farmer, whose family lived next door to Bush’s biological father. “At first I was so scared to talk to him because here was this larger than life figure about to win the Heisman Trophy and he is at my house. So, three months ago, if you had told me I would be playing the same position as him and the other great tailbacks that have come through here, I would have laughed.”
After a debut that featured four carries for four yards and one catch for 14 yards against California, Farmer knows his name is not yet worthy of being spoken in the same breath as former USC tailbacks Bush, Marcus Allen, O.J. Simpson or Charles White.
But for the class of 2011’s No. 1 recruit by Rivals.com, the journey from the slot to the backfield is all he’s concerned with going forward.
“I am basically going back to day one, starting all over and learning a brand new position,” Farmer said. “It’s about remembering the little things, the techniques, the fundamentals and just play[ing] hard.”
If you had mentioned Farmer’s name in the Trojans’ 2011 plans at the start of the season, the idea probably would have been tossed aside. But on Sept. 28, just when all signs pointed to the highly-touted wide receiver redshirting his freshman year, USC coach Lane Kiffin saw the need for Farmer at a position the university used to be celebrated for — tailback.
“He’s been playing quarterback, tailback and receiver, and we’ve actually been putting him at running back in individuals and he looks great there,” Kiffin said, after Farmer’s first practice at his new position. “[Having him make the switch] could be real exciting. It would give us a big, physical guy and one of the fastest guys in the country.”
As the weeks wore on, Farmer changed not only his jersey number, but the intensity level and swagger he played with. With each passing snap, the athleticism and speed (he finished second in the 100-meter dash at the 2010 California State Meet) so many praised him for coming out of Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., was put on display.
Though his progress was thwarted by a concussion and lower back injury during fall camp, as USC made its way into the bye week, Farmer was finally coming into his own.
“Coming here as a freshman, especially with all of the expectations, it took time for me to adjust,” Farmer said. “I feel like I have a feel for this position right now, but even with that, I still have to learn how to translate my instincts into what the coaches want me to do. I have a tendency to see the first gap and want to go right through it, instead of being patient and waiting for the play to develop around me. Like with everything else in football, that comes with time and experience.”
Heading into last Thursday’s game against Cal, the question still remained if Farmer would play against the Golden Bears, or if the USC coaching staff would hold off, opting to let the freshman work out all the kinks that come with making such a swift transition. Though the decision to let Farmer play didn’t necessarily translate to on-field success, the Los Angeles native is still wide-eyed about the experience.
“I started off a little nervous when I got called in that first series,” Farmer said. “But, I was ready for it, tried to do whatever I could. I loved the experience, but I am ready to get better from here on out.”
As USC gears up to play rival Notre Dame in its first night game in 21 years, the challenge for the novice tailback remains unquestionably tall. With the potential absence of senior tailback Marc Tyler, who dislocated his shoulder in the 30-9 win over Cal, Farmer might be called into action early and often Saturday night, a task he says he’s mentally, if not technically, ready for.
“From here on out, nerves won’t play a factor,” Farmer said. “Football is football. The field will be the same, the fans will be the same, the game will still be the same game. Right now, I’m just trying to get all of the technical things down because I can’t say I’m completely comfortable at the position just yet. It all depends on how long I prepare for it, how much time I put it to learning the nuances.”
Those nuances have made Farmer a film rat before and after practices the last few weeks, as he and running back coach Kennedy Polamalu attempt to speed up the freshman’s learning curve.
In addition to the film studies work he does inside Heritage Hall, Farmer has kept his eye on a certain running back at the next level.
“I look at Adrian Peterson, and his skill set and body type and it’s about where I am physically,” Farmer said. “But I want to be able to do all of the things he does. How he runs the ball, how he works his way around tackles. I’ll admit I try to imitate what he does.”
Though USC fans would be elated to have a true-to-life imitation of Peterson in the form of Farmer on Saturday night at Notre Dame Stadium, Farmer cautions his transformation is still very much in the infant stages.
Though that might not be music to the ears of most Trojan supporters, Farmer insists he’s takinga methodical approach.
“[Tailback] is my position now and it’s important I take things day by day,” Farmer said. “While it took some adjusting to, it has finally sunk in though, I am a running back. What I do from here, we will just have to wait and see.”
I live this kids attitude! Hopefully the only thing he learned from Bush is what to do when on the field. We don’t need any more sanctions!

Self-defense is a wonderful thing. Even if you favor pacifism, knowing how to defend yourself is an essential skill. Self-defense training is also a great way to get into shape. A good martial art discipline should not only work the entire body, but also strengthen coordination and build up muscle memory. And when it comes to this, Krav Maga is one of the best.
Krav Maga is a martial art used by the Israeli Defense Force, and it’s the fighting style Liam Neeson utilized in Taken to punch people in the throat. Designed to focus on incapacitating an opponent as fast as possible, the style emphasizes speed and uses the entire body to provide amazing cardio and strength training.
“Krav Maga is a continuously adapting system that takes the most efficient techniques of different styles of martial arts,” said AJ Lavarias, an instructor at Krav Maga Worldwide in West Los Angeles.
Some of Krav Maga’s kicks come from Muay Thai, and some of the ground techniques are rooted in Jiu-Jitsu — proving Krav Maga’s efficiency is based on the moves that are available.  If there are better ways to perform techniques, Krav Maga adapts and modifies to incorporate them.
The best way to describe Krav Maga is ruthlessly efficient. The style teaches practitioners to use everything they have, on them and around them.
When punching, for instance, instead of swinging an arm forward, Krav Maga teaches you to launch forward on both feet to close in on your opponent to build momentum. At the same time, when extending the striking arm out, one must twist at the hips, putting more speed into the punch. This works not only the arm, but the muscles in the hips and back as well.
There is not a fancy form or flow to attacks; instead, it’s just about taking out your opponent before they can hurt you by keeping the body constantly moving. One interesting, and challenging, part of Krav Maga training is maxing out an activity, be it punches or kicks, over a period of time. This works the body past the point of exhaustion, simulating what might happen in an extended fight.
Throwing two punches is easy; 30 is tough, but far easier after practicing. This gets the heart pumping. When the entire body is put to work like this, it helps to build endurance. The constant exercise helps tone muscles while getting great cardiovascular exercise.
“Krav Maga requires involvement of the entire body,” Lavarias said. “The way we build our technique is through muscle memory and in our classes we focus on teaching a few techniques in each class session.”
There’s an emphasis on training movement, on the ground and standing, like other activities, such as parkour. The warm-ups include exercises requiring all four limbs, sometimes using them in coordination to move, or running while punching or stretching the arms. Then in the combat training, the entire body is put to work, even if it’s just to throw a single punch.
The end result is a very tough, but highly engaging workout. Weights are not involved, but it’s a great way to build all-around fitness.
“We have a heavy emphasis on teaching our students to be aggressive and to fight for their lives to get home safely,” Lavarias said. “We want our students to be confident in themselves and their technique. There is also a greater mental aspect that is expressed as part of our self-defense. This is to ‘recognize the situation, assess the situation and address the situation.’”
Krav Maga is one of the most challenging fighting styles. The constant exercise creates great cardiovascular endurance, and using the entire body to power each strike works muscles that might be ignored — in addition to the regular ones already used when punching and kicking.
If lifting weights isn’t your thing, self-defense, and specifically Krav Maga, is a great alternative to training the body and building strength. It’s tough, challenging, fun and most of all, practical. For those interested in learning how to fight, this is one of the best ways to learn. And you’ll get in great shape doing it.

Usually, when a band puts out an album with an assortment of different musical ideas and tastes, it’s a warning sign of a potentially disjointed effort and an inability to find a cohesive thread.
Not so with Afropolitan, the new album from Derrick Ashong and Soulfège. Here, every song has a unique style that works to the greater focus of the record.
Following a quick instrumental intro, the album really gets started with its title track, a fast-paced hip-hop song. Unlike many rap songs currently out, which focus heavily on the beats or bass in a dubstep crossover, it’s Ashong’s vocals that drive the track, with the instrumentation as a complement. In a way, the track is close to old-school hip-hop, but Ashong’s lyrical style is entirely modern.
After the intense hip-hop of “Afropolitan,” the very reggae “Easy Does It” seems like a jarring turn. It’s only after listening to the entire album that the style changes make sense. But “Easy Does It,” like the song before it, excels in the genre that flavors it.
Switching styles, “Find Another Man” hits listeners with old-school funk. Here, the instruments take a bigger role, producing slick guitar lines and a clever, danceable beat.
Lyrically, there are two main themes at play in Afropolitan. On one end are the love songs, where Ashong and Gramling craft cool lyrics of romance and adventure with their partners.
There’s also a social and political bent. In many ways, Afropolitan is a call to action, telling listeners to get up and get involved in their communities. The songs that take on this theme are clever and far deeper than they might appear on the surface.
There really isn’t a clear signature sound to the album, but that’s a theme in and of itself. It’s an experiment in technical ability for the band, which still aims to offer entertaining and substantial songs. Ashong and Soulfège use the record to explore all Afro-based genres — appropriate, considering the album’s title.
The ballad “Angel” features an undercurrent of soul that picks up once the song gets going. Then there’s “No More,” a gospel-influenced track where Gramling’s vocals take over.
Keeping with the African influence, Ashong draws on a traditional song from Ghana in “Mle Mle Mle.” A drum-driven track, the song also brings back Ashong’s rapping skills, as if to balance out the increasingly mellow songs that dominate the record up until that point. It’s a unique mix of styles, taking cultural classics and mixing it with an MC-rap feel. It’s that kind of genre mashup that makes the album stand out.
Soulfège follows this up with another genre turn, this time embracing a kind of mix between reggae and swanky 1960s lounge music for “Life of the Party.” Like the previous track, it’s unexpected but it works. The influences the band pulls into each track seem tangential and unrelated, but each time, they are successful.
Afropolitan wraps up with “Close Your Eyes,” mixing together the song “Michael Row Your Boat” with spoken word lyrics from Ashong. It’s a simple song, amplified by a recurring horn element. In many ways it’s the culmination of the social aspect of the album, with the band singing about rejecting apathy and taking action to make its voice heard in society. The music is working hard to get its message across.
Afropolitan isn’t a collection of streamlined sounds. Instead, it’s a chance for a band to test its skills and master a wide range of genres. In that sense, Ashong and Soulfège succeed.
Though the album never regains the level of energy it sets up in “Afropolitan,” each track is still solid. Though the musical variety is what makes Afropolitan appealing to a larger audience, it’s also the quality of each song that makes the album worth listening to.

Detroit rock band Electric Six’s new album is disappointingly unremarkable — a muffled echo of the group’s glory days.
The band, formed in 2000, has made a name for itself in the last decade with diversely styled dance rock that oscillates between embracing and mocking the hyper-masculine party culture of modern American men.
Shameless dudes · Though Heartbeats and Brainwaves features an assortment of somewhat engaging tracks, the album as a whole is riddled with poorly crafted songwriting and mutedly phallocentric motifs. - Photo courtesy of Reybee Productions
Songs like “Danger! High Voltage” and “Body Shot,” on one hand, glorify primal dance floor scenes of fearless sexuality. In contrast, “Gay Bar,” with almost 20 million hits on YouTube, greatly differs from Electric Six’s more popular songs by gleefully lambasting male sexual insecurities by blending manly vocals with nonsensically homoerotic lyrics. Its message is that concertedly manly men are really just overcompensating.
So, if you love Electric Six, you are one of two things: a hipster-literate cynic who sneers at stereotypical frat bros, or a stereotypical frat bro. But by catering to each of these rivaling demographics, the band offers little substance to either. And so its catalog, while sometimes addictive, largely lacks in lyrical heft.
Heartbeats and Brainwaves’ opener “Psychic Visions” seemingly constitutes an admission of wrongdoing. At one point in the track, frontman Dick Valentine sings I’m the king of the submarines / making terrible music for teens. This is surprising for a band that once reveled in dumbness. Electric Six is older now, and evidently getting tired of the testosterone rock trimmings that long underpinned its popularity.
In Heartbeats and Brainwaves, Electric Six tries to extricate itself, but also can’t quite pull itself away, from the now-worn unabashed manliness of its early days. What results is an unfortunate compromise, a muted-sounding rendition of its older dumb-but-fun style that is at best unevenly enjoyable.
Take, for example, the second track, “French Bacon.” This tells a tragic story of two people, the narrator and a nameless girl, who are tangled in a contradictory relationship: a painful attachment they both need. Valentine croons, I’m never good at saying the right things / sometimes I say too much / sometimes I feel like a puppet with no strings / desperate and dying for your touch.
But this potentially interesting love song is so drenched in the mandatory manly non sequiturs it utterly fails to tell a cohesive story. Instead, it adds up to a muddled montage of imagery. And the song’s chorus, though catchy, certainly doesn’t approach the greatness of earlier Electric Six earworms.
That seems to be a trend in this album. Heartbeats and Brainwaves was written in an unusual way — Dick Valentine asked each of Electric Six’s members to write at least two songs. Some triple-dipped, which resulted in a 14-track final product. Normally this would lead to a lack of overall artistic cohesion, even though one might expect each band member’s contribution to be especially dense with inspiration.
Alas, nothing here will find a home in your next party’s playlist. Say what you will about “Gay Bar,” but it did rock the Internet for years with its catchy melody and proudly stupid lyrics. Heartbeats and Brainwaves lacks addictive songwriting, and needs a song that can stand out amid the unending online hurricane of new music.
Some of the album’s songs succeed more than others. “Gridlock” enters Franz Ferdinand territory with interesting results, painting a painful picture of an apprehensive dance-floor hook-up. “Intergalactic Version” achieves a big ethereal sound, complete with gospel-esque “whoa-oh” backup incantations. And “Free Samples,” an anthem literally for people giving out free samples, is so massively idiotic that if you don’t get frustrated with it, it might just get a chuckle out of you.
But these occasional winners are only moderately interesting. They don’t make up for an album full of bad songwriting. With Heartbeats and Brainwaves, Electric Six has graduated from the unashamedly phallocentric to the mutedly phallocentric, and that, as it turns out, is no improvement.
In its next attempt, Electric Six will have to either return to that old oafish manliness or finally slough it off.
Sorey 4 the sarc! Its a good piece of writing. Find your true target though. A new release no more deserves your prose than an old one. Try Flashy – its fulla love songs. Or Switzerland – the magnum opus of their country period. But listen …
Hey big ears. You’re In the long grass now! We are E6 fans. Themes? Fallow centric? Wot ya get? A 2.1 in communications? Sociology? Journalsme?
Electric Six rule! Music critics like Ryan are by and large acne-ridden lemmings who have accepted received wisdom from rags like Pitchfork that E6 is bad and they’re not supposed to give them a favorable review — ever. Idiots!
A good music critic should know not to compare the artists new work to their first, or any previous albums.
That’s like banging some chick (Girl A) and afterward thinking to yourself, “Man… that was pretty good, but ten years ago, Girl B was so much better . I wish I was still stickin’ it to Girl B even though she moved away and is married with kids now… Guess I can’t boink Girl A again. Shucks.”
Also you described everything that is good about French Bacon and called it bad. The whole “it isn’t a big deal that the girl I loved is dying” sets the apocalyptic and abstract feel of the album. And. bonus, it has a long, kick ass intro. The “muddled montage of imagery” is intentional and prevalent in the entire album because each song (wrap your head around this one) is a psychic vision, a fortune, a peek into the wasteland future that is humanity. God forbid Electric Six attempts to write an intelligent album with a cool, cryptic theme.
Guess I’ll go J-off to memories of Girl B instead of giving this album another listen.
Psychic Visions, French Bacon, It Gets Hot, Gridlock!, Interchangeable Knife, and Hello! I See You! are all great songs. E6 songs AREN’T supposed to tell a cohesive story, any of their fans could tell you that. I’ll be the first to admit there are some dull songs on here, the title track being the prime example, but the good tracks outnumber the dull ones. They have evolved since Gay Bar, deal with it.
You suck.

On Oct. 11, five years after the widely successful The Open Door, Evanescence released its highly anticipated, self-titled third album.
“With all the growth and experimentation, we didn’t betray what the fans want,” singer Amy Lee said in an interview with Reuters. “It’s still an Evanescence record.” 
Though that might be true — fans will recognize stylistically similar songs and Lee’s still-stunningly bright vocals placed over dark guitar riffs — Evanescence just isn’t quite up to par with Fallen or The Open Door.
The new 16-track record opens with the band’s recent single “What You Want,” which landed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart upon release. Though it got fans excited about the upcoming album, “What You Want” has not been the same sort of hit as “Bring Me to Life” or “Call Me When You’re Sober.” It’s unfortunate, then, that this fist-pumping, you-can’t-control-me single is one of the highest points of the album.
Die-hard Evanescence fans will notice that unlike the band’s former albums, which feature everything from hard-hitting tracks with heavy lyrics to gentle instrumentals, Evanescence’s tracks tend to sound the same. Many of the songs on the album seem to follow a specific formula: a drum-and-guitar intro for four to eight measures, followed by Lee singing verses composed of lower notes and moving into a higher register for the chorus. This repetitive pattern will likely leave listeners wondering, “Didn’t I hear this one already?”
There are exceptions to this pattern. “Lost in Paradise” is one of the few tracks that breaks the mold, highlighting a lilting piano introduction and sweet vocals from Lee. “Sick,” similar in attitude to the “What You Want” anthem, is redeemed by a previously-unheard chorus melody despite suffering from the predictability of several other songs on the album.
And though it’s not great melodically, “End of the Dream” marks a return to the brooding lyrics of classic Evanescence, with Lee singing I found a bird closing her eyes one last time / and I wonder if she dreamed like me.
Among the selection of unmemorable up-tempo tracks, fans will find songs that mimic former hits. “Oceans,” the 10th track on the album, opens with a vocal line similar to that of “Call Me When You’re Sober.” The note sequence and rhythm of the two opening lines are nearly identical, as though Evanescence were regurgitating melodies from previous songs.
On the other hand, “Swimming Home,” the softest track on the album, is reminiscent of “Good Enough” and “My Immortal” with gentle pianos and harps, yet it has its own distinctive flavor with a tender percussion track. The song is not merely a copy of an early, successful Evanescence song like other tracks on the album are.
The only problem with the throwback tracks is they don’t bring anything new to the table. They don’t innovate or build upon past accomplishments and instead end up sounding like imitations. It simply doesn’t seem to do anything new.
There is, however, one redeeming quality about these songs: Lee seems to have grown up a little and mixed in some self-confidence with her self-loathing lyricism.
In “Made of Stone,” Lee sings Speak your mind / like I care, self-assuredly laughing at a lover for whom she has no respect. This and songs such as “Sick” and “What You Want” have a new swagger to them. It shows that as a lyricist, Lee no longer simply plays the victim.
That being said, Lee’s bolder persona has led her to lose some subtlety in her lyrics. In one of the more musically memorable tracks, “My Heart is Broken,” Lee simply wails “My heart is broken” — her voice is pretty, but a bit dull. What happened to the more complex lyrics that implied broken-heartedness such as I’ve held your hand through all of these years / But you still have all of me, from 2003’s “My Immortal”?
Though every inch of Lee’s lyrics don’t exhibit this trend, the in-your-face lyrics are still, for better or worse, heavily embedded in the new album’s sound.
Evanescence is not awful, but it’s not excellent, either — and it’s certainly not the “new-and-improved” sound fans were expecting. It seems that Lee, insecure about the band’s new lineup, decided to spend 16 tracks trying to convince us Evanescence was still the band fans had fallen in love with years ago.
The ironic thing is, no one would have questioned her if her new songs had demonstrated some of the risk and innovation of her former hits.
… I’m not a huge Evanescence fan, and the first thing I thought when I heard “Oceans” was “Oh, this is from ‘Call Me When You’re Sober’, isn’t it?” But seriously, harder artists than Evanescence have done that. For instance, metal vocalist Otep Shamaya of the band OT3P (isn’t that clever?) reuses and rephrases lyrics constantly. It doesn’t bug me that they renew some material from their older stuff-in fact, I like it. It’s kind of a harkening back to younger, darker days.
Unlike “Fallen” and even “The Open Door” (and especially “Origins”) this album, when I listen to it, seems to be an album filled with mature emotion. Like you said, Lee isn’t playing the victim anymore, and that’s what was holding me back from really liking the band. I honestly think their new album is quite good.
Please, this is their BEST album yet. You obviously just sampled the songs without truly taking the time to enjoy each one. This album BLOWS ME AWAY!!
Seriously, it may disappoint YOU, but the EvFans love it. I have been a hardcore & faithful fan of Evanescence since 2003, and I love the new album. It does have a bit of the flavor of their old music, but it still has a lot of new stuff we’ve never heard from them. All in all, it’s an amazing album, and all of their previous albums are incomparable to one another because they are also amazing. <3
This is a false story. There #1 RIGHT NOW! How is that a disappointment?  love the album more than the other 2.
Carrie you’re an idiot. the album DOES NOT disappoint. stay mad.

Outrage at LAPD officers
I am outraged and disappointed by the fact that LAPD officers station themselves outside USC for the sole purpose of waiting for students to cross the street while there is still time left on the clock and issuing them three-figure pedestrian tickets. On Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, there will oftentimes be LAPD officers posted on the east island dividing Exposition Boulevard and 37th Street.
They will wait and watch for students to cross the street (going north or south on Figueroa) while there are still 20 seconds or more left on the clock, stop them at the island and give them a ticket. This is clearly not a public safety concern, as the officers are waiting on the island with their motorcycles turned off to see if students will cross the street while there is time left on the clock.
If this were a matter of public safety, the officers would station themselves on the corners of Figueroa and Exposition, not on the center divide of Exposition and 37th, and warn the students before they actually start crossing the street that if they choose to cross, they will be fined for it.
Furthermore, they ticket without offering warnings, and I find this especially alarming, as many of us students being ticketed are international students and might be from countries where there is no concept of getting a ticket for using a crosswalk.
I was issued a ticket for this reason about a week ago. At the time I was issued my ticket, another officer in the same location was in the process of issuing two other students tickets, and the officer who issued my ticket also ticketed another person at the same time as me. Within a span of two minutes, four tickets had been issued. I can only imagine how many total tickets were issued that day at that one location and how much money the city stands to gain from us students, an extremely vulnerable population, as we do not have a steady source of income.
I am saddened and discouraged by the fact that the first time I am made aware that this is illegal is also the same time I am being punished for it. I have always tried to be a civically minded and politically engaged person. I vote in every local, state and national election for which I am eligible. The level of civic and political engagement among youth is extremely low, and now I know that it is for reasons such as this. Further, there have been countless times when I have heard my peers say derogatory and offensive comments about police.
I have never done this and have often defended the institution. I do this no more because I am so irate at this situation. I do not feel protected nor do I feel served when being issued a ticket for crossing the street with 20 seconds left on the timer while I am walking to class.
I am enraged and discouraged that the city’s resources are being spent on policemen stationed outside USC for the sole goal of giving students, who are simply walking to class, tickets for an action that they are completely unaware is illegal and which does not at all hinder public or even personal safety.

These tickets (and the LAPD as an organization) are disgraceful. Surely LAPD has better things to worry about (like locals stealing from and shooting USC students) than jaywalking. Yet another case of absurd overzealousness on behalf of the law.
Ms. Nguyen,
If you cannot figure out that a flashing red hand means stop, please stop voting.
Not trying to offend you, but enlighten you!
I agree with Joe Friday.  When you moved here to the states, you need to make yourself aware of the laws.  Everyone needs to be help accountable for their actions.  Be it the crosswalkers and/or drivers.  Once again, be blessed it is only a fine you must pay.  USC students are being ran over and killed left and right, because either the driver is not paying attention or the student is not paying attention.  This is for your protection, if you don’t like it cross at another cross walk.  Furthermore, no one is paying the tickets anyway.  Also, officers did not join the LAPD, Sherrif, Highway Patrol, State Police, or any other entity, to monitor crosswalks.  They are not looking for you.  There is a reason for everything.  PAY THE TICKET!
stop complaining and start obeying the law and rules. USC students are not above the law.
Sorry that you received a jaywalking ticket, but there’s a price to breaking the law.  Just ask USC student Marcus Garfinkle how easy it is to get hit by a car when you are LEGALLY in a cross walk.  In 2009, he was hit and dragged 500 feet by a hit & run driver while his friend, Adrianna Bachan, was killed. So yes, this is about the safety of USC students even if the ticket hurts only your wallet.
Uh, Joe, don’t use fallacious arguments (in your case, a false analogy) to compare the tragic 2009 incident to cursory street crossings during daylight. 
It is a TRAP that the CORRUPT LAPD sets up.
Uh, Corrupt, if you don’t want to obey laws, be prepared to pay fines.  Jaywalking laws and enforcement  are designed with public safety in mind, but that must be beyond your comprehension.
Joe, it’s actually not “jaywalking,” it’s a violation of the California Vehicle Code, specifically of CVC §21456(b).  If you want to look up the definition of jaywalking, I refer you to CVC §§21954-955.
A quick summary if you don’t want to look it up, though, §21954 says that if a person is in the road, s/he must yield the right of way to a car that poses an “immediate hazard” to that person; this does not relieve the driver from his/her duty of care towards the pedestrian, however.
§21955 says that if a person is somewhere on a street between two controlled intersections (controlled by traffic signals or police officers), s/he may not cross that street except at a crosswalk.
Maybe you should learn the law before speaking yourself.  Also, bringing up the 2009 accident means absolutely nothing.  That was a failure of awareness on the part of both the driver (primarily) and the pedestrians.  Even if a police officer had been there to ticket the pedestrians, that would not have stopped the car from striking them.

The university issued an email to all students Wednesday before the UC Berkeley football game about an outbreak of mumps at the California campus. Many USC students traveled to Berkeley for the Weekender trip and could have brought back this virus.  The email warned students to be aware of the common means of mumps transmission: “sharing drinks, cigarettes, towels or being coughed on.”
It told students to wash their hands frequently, exercise caution in sharing anything and avoid close contact with those who are already ill.

The email sent from the university seems less than proactive. Rather than simply listing off suggestions many of us are fully aware of, USC should instead push health and cleanliness as it did in 2008 when a gastrointestinal bug went around campus.
In 2008, USC instituted many initiatives to ensure hygiene in response to the outbreak. The university installed hand sanitizers throughout campus for example. This action is more proactive than the recent email that simply rattles off information that we know.
We won’t know right away if mumps will affect students at USC, but we must ensure cleanliness and urge USC to prepare for a proper response if an outbreak does occur.
Students should use the sanitary wipes available in the fitness rooms to leave machines and weights a bit more sanitary for other users, for example.
These practices, however, should be implemented when students think they or the people around them are sick, especially because the symptoms of mumps don’t manifest until 12 to 25 days following exposure. Students should always exercise standard sanitary practices, in the case they might spread the disease unknowingly.
Overall, it is better to be proactive than reactive when it comes to health. A healthy lifestyle can prevent infections that could severely affect the student population like the gastrointestinal bug did in 2008.
Students should adhere to the golden rule when it comes to health — doing for others what they would like to be done for themselves. Though it might take some extra effort to leave a place as it was found, these efforts are appreciated and contribute to a healthier environment at USC.
Students, however, should not only be the ones to create a healthy environment.
USC is interested in students’ health and many resources exist for students to learn about and address many of the illnesses that might befall them. The new Roger and Michele Dedeaux Engemann Student Health Center, for example, is being built to better serve the large residential population of USC. Yet the email simply was not useful.
Students know to wash their hands and avoid coughing on each other. The university can help make USC a sanitary and healthy campus and provide proactive tips for prevention of infection rather than simply listing off well-known prevention methods.
Though it is not possible to entirely eliminate the danger of contracting mumps in general, the continued practice of standard sanitary regulations will help better prepare USC in the case of an outbreak.

A perfect 8-0 singles record this season is a big feat, but the only bigger feat for USC sophomore Emilio Gomez was hoisting the singles trophy at the Battle in the Bay Classic this weekend.
Gomez, ranked No. 66 in International Tennis Association rankings and seeded No. 2 in the tournament, defeated Pepperdine’s Hugh Clarke 6-4, 6-3 in the Battle in the Bay Classic finals in San Francisco to take home the singles title. With the victory over Clarke, Gomez remains undefeated in singles play and becomes the second consecutive USC player to win the singles title in the Battle in the Bay Classic.
Gomez’s victories over Stanford’s Robert Stineman, Pacific’s Alex Golding, San Diego’s Thibaut Visy and Boise State’s Andy Bettles in the four-day competition set up the finals matchup against Clarke.
Through five matches in San Francisco, Gomez lost just one set. Visy, who defeated USC freshman Eric Johnson in the second round, captured the first set against Gomez in the quarterfinals 6-1. Gomez bounced back by winning the next two sets 6-3, 6-1 to take the match before his 6-2, 6-3 win over Bettles in the semifinals.
Gomez and freshman Eric Johnson also paired up in the 16-team doubles bracket, advancing to the semifinals before losing 7-9 to a Pepperdine team that included Clarke and sophomore David Sofaer.
“We played pretty well altogether,” Johnson said. “There wasn’t anything strategically I would have done differently. We played a good match.”
Clarke and Sofaer eventually garnered the doubles title over Stanford’s Stineman and Walker Kehrer with an 8-5 win.
In other singles draw play, freshman Jonny Wang barely missed a trip to the semifinals, falling to Stanford’s Daniel Ho in a narrow 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-7 (2) loss on Saturday. Before this quarterfinal matchup, Wang had upended both Saint Mary’s Gavin Leon and Boise State’s Garrett Patton in straight sets.
“I definitely could work on getting balls deeper and being more aggressive, but I think I was pretty consistent throughout the matches,” Wang said.
Johnson also represented USC in the singles draw, advancing past the first round by taking advantage of Saint Mary’s Saad Benkirane’s weaker forehand in a 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 comeback on Thursday.
San Diego’s Visy ended Johnson’s run with a 6-1, 6-1 victory in the second round Friday.
“[Visy] had very good defense,” Johnson said. “My offense was doing well. I just wasn’t finishing points very well, and that’s not going to work.”
Had Johnson advanced, he would have faced Gomez in the quarterfinals.
After traveling over the country for four different fall tournaments, the USC’s men’s tennis team will finally get some action closer to home in the ITA Southwest Regional Championships in Pepperdine, Calif. from Thursday through next Monday.
