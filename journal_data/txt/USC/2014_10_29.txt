The Hult Prize, a global competition for college or university student entrepreneurs, launches at USC on Thursday night.
The competition, which began in 2010 and whose sponsors include the Hult International Business School and the Clinton Global Initiative, asks small student groups to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues with the chance to ultimately win $1 million and a chance to develop their idea into their own start-up. This year’s topic was chosen by former President Bill Clinton and is centered on providing early childhood education in the urban slums and beyond.
The quarterfinal event will be held at Hoffman Hall at 10 a.m. on Nov. 15, and the winner will move on to the regional finals held in San Francisco, Boston, Shanghai, Dubai and London in March 2015. The regional finalists then attend the Hult Prize Accelerator for six weeks during July and August to take an intensive course load of entrepreneurial classes from Hult International Business School. Following the Hult Prize Accelerator, the finalists attend the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in September and pitch their ideas in front of a world-renowned group of judges, which includes Clinton, that chooses the grand champion.
“The Hult Prize is a global students competition, and I can’t think of a better community that has the cultural connections, experiences, and knowledge needed to solve global issues than ours,” Anzal Adam, campus director of the Hult Prize Initiative at USC, said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Adam, a senior majoring in accounting and business administration, competed in the 2013 Hult Prize competition and said that that was what inspired her to bring the event to campus.
“During my first semester in fall 2012, I was invited by a group of graduate students from the Price School to join their team in competing for the 2013 Hult Prize and solving Global Food Insecurity,” Adam said in an email. “We made it to the regional finals in Shanghai.”
Adam, a native of Somalia who has also lived in Kenya, said the 2013 Hult Prize topic hit close to home.
“Having lived in Kenya where the Kibera slum, the largest in the world, is situated, I know just how dire the situation was for the slum dwellers,” Adam said in an email. “Also, my native country Somalia had just experienced one of the most severe famine[s] and drought[s] in the preceding years and I thought that it would be a shame to pass up the chance to help make a difference.”
Teams of three to five members have been permitted to register at Hult Prize at USC’s website or their Facebook page since last Wednesday.
One of these hopeful teams competing, led by team captain, Remaya Campbell, said that their strategy is to look to those in need for the solution.
“We’re really basing our team on the idea that solutions from afar are not effective,” Campbell, a freshman majoring in film and television production, said in a text message to the Daily Trojan. “To change someone’s life you have to understand them, and you can’t be afraid to walk among them.”
Overall, Adam said her biggest goal is to bring the Trojan Family together for the common good.
“We hope to promote interdisciplinary interaction within the USC community in solving social issues,” Adam said in an email.

The Women’s Student Assembly brought the national event “Carry That Weight” to USC on Wednesday.
The event was inspired by Emma Sulkowicz, a student at Columbia University, who has been carrying her mattress with her on campus as long as her rapist still attends the university. At colleges across the country, students, staff and faculty members planned to stand in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault and violence by carrying mattresses together.

Sulkowicz, who expressed that her demonstration was more for artistic purposes than for protest, said in an interview with the Columbia Spectator  that the mattress represents a private space and a burden that she continues to bear. Activists hope that bringing the event to college campuses will show a commitment to improving the way sexual and domestic violence is dealt with.
Vanessa Diaz, the new assistant director for WSA, organized the event at USC.
“When I first discovered the event a few weeks back, I was amazed at the solidarity and really wanted to bring that to our campus,” she said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We have coalitions like R.I.S.E. (Reform, Inform, Speak Out, Empower) and past organizations such as S.C.A.R. (Student Coalition Against Rape), so this is a conversation that is relevant and continues to be relevant on our campus. The University of Southern California would be doing itself an injustice by not participating in this nationwide symbolic solidarity.”
The goal of this demonstration of solidarity was to show survivors that people would help lift the burden of sexual violence from their shoulders — carrying the weight together.
“The purpose of this protest is to remove the shame that falls upon the survivors of rape, and instead move that shame to the institutions and entities that have failed us,” Diaz said in an email.
WSA created a Facebook event and a Google form to encourage the USC community to participate in the “Carry That Weight” event. Participants were asked if they needed assistance holding a mattress, and people were also told to use pillows if they were unable to carry mattresses.
“The most important aspect of the ‘Carry That Weight’ event is that people ask to help,” Diaz said in an email. “As one of the Public Relations Chair for the Women’s Student Assembly, I did my best to not force people to volunteer, but rather offer the opportunity to show support for an important cause. I did not have to ‘get’ people to participate. People already wanted to.”
Claire Porter, a freshman majoring in communication, heard about the event from a friend at the University of California, Berkeley, and decided to share USC’s event coordinated by WSA on Facebook.
“It’s so relatable,” she said. “A girl around my age gets raped at college — that could be anyone here, too.”
Porter said that the event was also indicative of other safety issues faced by women on campus.
“It’s always a thought going through girls’ heads that it’s become a natural way to think,” she said. “We always walk in pairs, have someone walk us home, etc. It’s all rape prevention. We’re all sympathetic to her case and thus, it is easier to find it in our hearts to support her and everyone else who has dealt with such a traumatic event.”
Though Diaz said only around 30 students responded to the survey indicating they would participate in raising awareness, students felt that the event promoted an important message.
“Sexual assault is very real and very serious, so colleges should treat it as such,” said Alisha Garg, a freshman majoring in business administration. “It’s great to see people participate in the ‘Carry That Weight’ event here at USC. Seeing people walk around campus with mattresses definitely caught my attention and is a powerful symbol of how victims are never alone and always have people around them who can help carry the burden.”

On Wednesday night, the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business honored Alumni Entrepreneur of the Year Aaron Levie.

The ceremony, which was part of the larger conference Silicon Beach @USC, was held from at the Trojan Grand Ballroom in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. Silicon Beach refers to the area of West Los Angeles known for a high concentration of technology companies.
“We always like to bring in highly successful entrepreneurs to Marshall to supplement our courses, and each year we honor an alumni entrepreneur,” said Dave Belasco, co-director of the Lloyd Greif Center. “The founders of companies like Kinkos, MySpace and Tinder have come out of USC. This year we are thrilled to welcome back and celebrate Aaron Levie.”
Now in its third year, the Silicon Beach @USC conference is a program jointly organized by the Marshall School of Business and the School of Cinematic Arts to promote leaders in the fields of film, technology startups and academia.
“The conference is great because it allows students to participate in business competitions with real prize money at stake and also see founders of startups like Siri, Square, Stubhub and Kiva,” Belasco said.
The event was free for all USC students, alumni and registered attendees of the conference and included a forum and student question-and-answer session with Levie.
“We are here to teach students the skillsets and mindset to launch businesses and change the world, and Levie is one of many sources of inspiration,” Belasco said.
Levie is the CEO and co-founder of Box, a Los Altos-based online storage company that connects people and information across all types of devices.
“We build a platform that makes it really easy to work with and collaborate around data,” Levie said. “A company’s data, in addition to its employees, is the most crucial part of its success because it is the heart of its ideas and intellectual property.”
According to an article this past March in The New York Times, Box’s value is estimated at $2 billion, and 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies are paying customers.
Levie attended USC until taking a leave of absence as a junior in December 2005 to pursue his work full-time with high school friend and then-Duke University student Dylan Smith.
“I took a broad set of classes at USC and took advantage of different domains because they were made easily available, which is such a great aspect of this university,” Levie said. “But by the time [Box] launched in September 2005, I was spending about 50 percent of my time on school and 50 percent on the company, and I reached a point that I wanted to focus entirely on our project.”
Levie believes Box’s innovative approach allowed it to rise above the competition of traditional online storage vendors when it was first launched.
“The bet early on was that heads of companies would value the user experience of the technology they were enabling their employees to have,” Levie said. “Box offers usability and sustainability to manage corporate information that others just didn’t have.”
Over the past nine years, Box has expanded to 27 million individual users and has 1,100 employees. Levie is optimistic that it will continue to grow because it has stayed true to its startup values that cater to users.
“My job is not that different now from when it was at the beginning with just four employees,” Levie said. “We are always thinking like a startup. We are always learning about how technology is changing. The only way to have that flexibility to maintain that startup structure is to have an infrastructure and a set of employees so I don’t have to spend too much time away from customers.”
USC alumnus Lloyd Greif, investment banker and namesake of Marshall’s entrepreneurial center, presented the award to Levie at the conclusion of the event.
“I think Aaron [Levie] had the perfect combination of humor and wisdom in his words tonight,” Greif said. “One pearl that particularly stood out was when he said we should be in constant, relentless execution mode. If we take away anything from tonight, it would be those four words.”

After tough matches against the nation’s top two teams the Women of Troy are set to face off against the lowly Washington State Cougars this Friday.
Flying high · Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio posted 15 kills and nine digs in USC’s three-set loss to Washington Wednesday night. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
Entering the Halloween contest, No. 20 USC has an overall record of 12-9 and a 5-6 record in the Pac-12 play, following a loss to No. 2 Washington on Wednesday night.
Despite being ranked 18 spots lower, USC played Washington close, losing by just two points in each set for an overall score of 26-24, 26-24, 25-23. USC led late in the third set, but couldn’t quite hold off the Huskies, who have long been a thorn in USC’s side. Last year, Washington knocked USC out in the NCAA Regional final in a tough five-setter.
Against the Huskies on Wednesday, junior outsider hitter Samantha Bricio led the charge with 15 kills, while sophomore outsider hitter Ebony Nwanebu added 11 along with eight digs.
USC couldn’t quite contain Washington’s star player Krista Vansant, who posted 17 kills and 10 digs.
But the Women of Troy must now turn their attention to the Cougars, who are 10-12 overall and 1-9 in conference play. Though on paper this appears to be an easy match for the Women of Troy, the team knows that they shouldn’t take any opponent lightly.
When the two teams met earlier this season on Oct. 3, USC won a thrilling five-set match in which the final set had two ties and one lead change. Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio recorded a double-double with a game-high 28 kills and 13 digs.
Since that match, however, the Women of Troy have changed their offensive system and personnel. Instead of running a 6-2 formation with sophomore setter Alice Pizzasegola and senior setter Hayley Crone controlling the offense, the team no longer has two back-row setters. Instead, senior opposite Emily Young has taken over setting duties in the front row, presenting an entirely new challenge for the visiting Cougars.
Head coach Mick Haley acknowledged the challenges of such a midseason change.
“It takes a while to develop and we have only done it for a week and a half,” Haley said. “The more we play, the better we are going to get out of it. We are just trying to speed it up as much as we can.”
Though USC’s offense has changed slightly, its production has not slipped. Bricio has 313 kills on the season to go along with 63 aces. Her teammate Nwanebu has started to find her groove after coming back from a preseason injury. Nwanebu has averaged 15.33 kills and 10.33 digs in her last three matches.
The Women of Troy’s defense has followed the offense’s example by upping the intensity. Sophomore libero Taylor Whittingham entered Wednesday night’s match against Washington State leading the Pac-12 with 4.64 digs per set.
“[Leading the conference] is really cool. I didn’t even realize it,” Whittingham said. “It’s all thanks to the blockers because they help me see it and funnel the ball to me.”
Ruddins managed 11 digs in Wednesday night’s matchup.
Though Washington State has its hands full trying to contain Bricio, Nwanebu and Ruddins, the Cougars have their own one-two combo on the outside. Outside hitter Kyra Holt has been averaging 3.26 per set with outside hitter Jaicee Harris right behind her at 2.95. Setter Haley MacDonald has put up great numbers running the team’s 5-1 offense with over 11 assists per set.
With roughly half of conference play in the books, the Women of Troy hope to make a late run in order to secure home court advantage for the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament. Their quest begins on Friday night at the Galen Center.

The USC football team has not met expectations this season. That much is abundantly clear.
No matter how impressive of a product the Trojans have put onto the field at times, they have been nowhere near consistent enough to compete for a Pac-12 title, let alone a spot in the NCAA playoff. Whether coaching, execution, lack of depth or a combination of those factors is to blame, the team’s results through eight games simply do not match its talent level, or the strength of its opponents. Even worse, without wins over UCLA and Notre Dame in the coming weeks, 2014 will probably be seen as a complete disappointment in the eyes of the Trojan faithful.
Great. I’m glad we got that out of the way, because I’m sick of hearing about it.
As much as this season has been, in the words of one of my housemates, “pretty lame,” I simply can’t agree with the far-too-large group of USC fans who are legitimately dissatisfied with the state of the program.
I’ve been a a college football fan my entire life, and I’ve experienced plenty of frustration — thank you mid-2000s Cal Bears. I understand the emotion behind the calls to “fire Sark” or “fire Haden” or my personal favorite, “fire somebody.” Of course fans want to hold someone accountable for failure. That’s only natural. But there’s something else behind this outward frustration.
Firing a coach is the easiest possible solution to any team’s problems. It sends the message that something is broken, and once it gets fixed everything will be right once again. Yeah, its a little rough for fans, but it also gives them hope; the last guy had it wrong, but this new guy will bring us back to glory.
You know what’s actually difficult for fans to handle in the face of a struggling team? Not firing a coach. That sends an entirely different message: maybe we just aren’t performing well, maybe the teams we’re playing are actually pretty damn good, and maybe — in the case of USC — rebuilding a fallen dynasty might take longer than we’d like.
Facing these facts are far more painful than the bittersweet misery of the late-Lane Kiffin era, when you always had in the back of your mind that Kiffin was the one man holding his team back. So when a freak Hail Mary costs the Trojans one game, we call for defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox’s head. When junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor steps out of bounds on a key fourth-and-2 against Utah, we want to fire that Kiffin-clone Sarkisian immediately. It’s the easy solution, but we know its not the right one.
Weirdly enough, keeping the “fire Sark” talk alive protects us from a fact that we don’t want to face: that the USC football program is headed in the right direction.
Sure, the results aren’t showing that every game. And yes, new head coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff have not been perfect. But as my fellow columnist Luke Holthouse outlined with very intelligent football talk yesterday, that hasn’t been the problem.
Because of lingering NCAA sanctions, the Trojans brought 48 scholarship players to Salt Lake City on Saturday. Newsflash, that’s not nearly enough to compete at a high level for a full 60 minutes. It’s not our coaching staff’s fault, it’s not our players fault, it’s not our athletic director’s fault. It just is what it is: an obstacle to winning football games.
The Trojans also play in the Pac-12, which has gotten exponentially tougher since USC dominated nine also-rans  in the middle of the last decade. Eight Pac-12 teams have spent at least a week in the AP Top 25 this season, with the Trojans playing five of them at some point this season. The south division alone has been a bloodbath thus far, with nearly every team’s NCAA playoff hopes in smoldering ruins and the potential for a massive tiebreaker at the top when all is said and done. Once again, not the coaching staff’s fault, not the players fault, not our athletic director’s fault. Just another obstacles that all serious contenders have to overcome.
So what does all this mean? It doesn’t mean we have the wrong athletic director. It doesn’t mean we have the wrong coach or the wrong defensive coordinator. It simply means the Trojans need to keep improving if they want to return to the college football elite. And that could take a while.
If you want any concrete proof that the program is headed in the right direction, try to remember the last time USC lined up to play Washington State. We lost 10-7, in the Coliseum, without giving up an offensive touchdown. Now that was the coach’s fault.

I didn’t like Sarkisian being hired to begin with. Haden should have let Orgeron be the head coach this year and see what he could do. That would have been the smart decision. USC still had a year let on their sanctions. What really hurt USC this year though was firing a really good DC and hiring a mediocre one. That has really hurt USC this year. Their defense did a lot better last year than they did the previous couple years. Why change something that was getting better?

After three tough losses this season, it would be understandable for the USC football team to give up on the season. This group of Trojans, however, showed up at practice on Wednesday ready to work and improve as they prepare for their game against Washington State and the CougarsŌĆÖ pass-heavy offense.
New role ┬Ę Redshirt sophomore linebacker Scott Felix returns to the starting lineup this week, replacing injured senior J.R. Tavai. Felix was relegated to a backup role after sophomore SuŌĆÖa Cravens moved to outside linebacker. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
You Shall Not Pass
Though last week the Trojans had to embrace a stop-the-run mentality, this week theyŌĆÖre trying to stop the pass. Washington State is a high-octane passing unit led by record-setting gunslinger Connor Halliday.
ŌĆ£They might throw the ball 85 times Saturday. WeŌĆÖre going to have to live with that,ŌĆØ head coach Steve Sarkisian said. ŌĆ£If you throw the ball 85 times ŌĆö I donŌĆÖt care if itŌĆÖs the ŌĆÖ85 Bears out there ŌĆö youŌĆÖre going to complete some passes.ŌĆØ
Knowing that the opponent is going to come out passing the ball the majority of the game, the Trojans are embracing that style of play and gearing up to stop the aerial attack. One of the players who has been able to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks so far this season is sophomore outside linebacker SuŌĆÖa Cravens, who recorded two sacks against Utah.
ŌĆ£ItŌĆÖs easier to know that theyŌĆÖre going to come out trying to pass the ball,ŌĆØ Cravens said. ŌĆ£We know what they want to do. We just have to execute.ŌĆØ
Another player that will be expected to step up is redshirt senior safety Gerald Bowman, who is returning from injury this week.
Bowman is embracing his role, and he knows that the secondary has to do its job against the Cougars.
ŌĆ£WeŌĆÖre coached to not let anyone get behind us,ŌĆØ Bowman said. ŌĆ£We all know what the secondary means to the defense.ŌĆØ
Getting to the Finish Line
A main problem that the Trojans have run into in their losses this year has been their play at the end of games. These close, last-second losses could easily affect the team in a negative way. Still, Sarkisian has been impressed with the attitude of his players and is looking forward to their next opportunity to close out a game.
ŌĆ£We escaped at Arizona. We escaped at Stanford,ŌĆØ Sarkisian said. ŌĆ£ThereŌĆÖs going to have to be a game where we do it the right way, and we finish the game the way weŌĆÖre capable of finishing the game.ŌĆØ
Sarkisian also noted that his team has played extremely well at times.
ŌĆ£IŌĆÖve just tried to challenge the guys on continuing to embrace their attitude on coming out here with a great attitude with great energy, and to their credit, they did it again,ŌĆØ the first-year coach said. ŌĆ£IŌĆÖve made it a real clear point to them about actually how well weŌĆÖve played, but we have to finish better and we have to be confident in our ability to finish ŌĆö to make the plays at the critical moments ŌĆö because weŌĆÖre plenty capable of doing it.ŌĆØ
Shining Stars
Sarkisian praised the leaders on his team for working hard at practice day in and day out and motivating the rest of the players through this rocky patch. One player Sarkisian specifically praised was junior defensive end Leonard Williams.
ŌĆ£The attitude [Williams] brings is really cool,ŌĆØ Sarkisian said. ŌĆ£ItŌĆÖs really refreshing that a megastar in this day and age can really maintain that work ethic and that desire and that passion every single day.ŌĆØ
Sarkisian also mentioned junior wideout Nelson Agholor, redshirt junior tailback Javorius ŌĆ£BuckŌĆØ Allen, freshman wideout JuJu Smith, freshman cornerback AdoreeŌĆÖ Jackson and Cravens for also embracing the leadership mentality and inspiring their teammates.
ŌĆ£They probably practice harder than anyone else,ŌĆØ Sarkisian said. ŌĆ£That sends a great message to their teammates, and I think itŌĆÖs shifting the culture of how we attack every day.ŌĆØ
The head coach wants his team to start believing in themselves, and he believes that will help their game on the field.
ŌĆ£WeŌĆÖre all at our best when we play with belief and not hope,ŌĆØ Sarkisian said.

In November of my freshman year at USC, a fellow student raped me.
I was intoxicated, meaning I was drunk. I was also incapacitated, meaning I was intoxicated to the extent that I was no longer capable of normal activity such as consenting to sex.
Many of us have gotten intoxicated to the point of incapacitation before. A problem, however, for some students — often, but not always female — is that this carries an undue risk of sexual assault.
For this reason, USC’s policy on sexual misconduct specifically defines sexual activity with a person who is incapacitated as non-consensual, meaning sexual assault. This is similar to, though an improvement upon, the California Penal Code, which states that sexual assault occurs in circumstances “where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating or anesthetic substance” or “where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act.”
Such provisions are frequently misinterpreted to mean that persons with any amount of alcohol in their body cannot give consent, thus giving deranged and retributive women license to run around having sex with men just one shot deep and then later accusing them of rape.
An Oct. 21 op-ed published in the Daily Trojan (“Harvard’s sexual assault policies reflect larger issue”) for example, incorrectly stated that “USC’s sexual assault policy states that consent cannot be given while the victim is intoxicated,” and thus declared the grievance process a matter of who can be first to cry rape.
In fact, the only place where USC’s policy addresses intoxication is to state that the intoxication of the accused cannot serve as an excuse for the assault committed, just as being intoxicated does not get you out of robbery, murder or any other crime.
There is an essential difference to be noted here between a person who is “intoxicated” and a person who is “incapacitated.” “Intoxicated” means you’ve imbibed some sort of mind-altering toxin — i.e. alcohol, marijuana or cocaine — but it does not necessarily mean you’re incapable of walking, talking or consenting to sex. For all you know, I could be intoxicated right now, but I am still capable of writing this article drawing this important distinction, as I am still capable of giving my consent (should I want to) to sexual activity.
If, on the other hand, I were intoxicated to the point that I “could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity,” which is how USC defines “incapacitated” in Section E.2 III of the Student Conduct Code, I could not give my consent. I literally wouldn’t be capable. On that night in November 2011, I wasn’t capable.
To suggest to students who are raped while incapacitated that their rapes are loopholes that should be expunged from university policy is to discourage these students from coming forward, as well as to discourage their peers from recognizing these instances as rape, including the very people who — as a result — might not hesitate to perpetrate them.
Make no mistake, this sort of misinformation is the same thing for which the university has fallen under scrutiny, for which more than 80 institutions are under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights. As students, we might not be held legally responsible for these missteps, but that does not mean they are not equally as damaging or as dangerous.
It heartens me to see more people entering the campus dialogue around sexual violence because I am a firm believer that we cannot begin to solve this crisis until we are first comfortable talking about it.
But as much as I want to encourage open dialogue about the issue, I also want to remind my fellow Trojans that any conversation about sexual assault has an impact on a very real threat to USC students. Sexual assault happens here. Students rape other students who are incapacitated, intoxicated or sober — and the common denominator in all of these scenarios is that the assaulted person has not given consent.
To my fellow students, I would urge you: Before you profess yourself an expert in sexual assault policy, take some time to educate yourself about those policies and their context. Before you dismiss incidents of rape, like my own, where the victim was incapacitated, as simply a matter of who reported whom, consider the experiences of those individuals and what it might be like to go to school every day in an environment where those experiences are not taken seriously.
And for that matter, consider the experiences of all the survivors of sexual violence on this campus — of which there are many genders, colors, backgrounds and nations; and who, for the most part, you are completely unaware of because we still live in a society where survivors are safest being silent.
On-campus entities like the Title IX Office and the Center for Women and Men offer resources and programming to help students learn more about sexual assault and associated laws, policies and procedures. RISE Student Alliance also offers educational programming by and for students to help foster awareness within the campus community.

Time is money, and AppleŌĆÖs recent addition of Apple Pay to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus software seems to capture this sentiment. Apple Pay has shaped the software to meet the needs and wants of its users more than other online payment methods have.
Jennifer Frazin | Daily Trojan
Apple has already secured significant market share when it comes to technological gadgets and mobile operating system software. From iPods to MacBooks and iPhones to iPads, consumers canŌĆÖt get enough of Apple products. Now with Apple Pay, the company virtually transforms the iPhone into a credit card.
Recently, however, there has been some backlash for Apple Pay across media outlets. Based on the notions generated from the failures of similar payment methods in the past, skepticism is understandable. Critics question the functional use of the payment method; however, many fail to realize the ingenuity Apple Pay offers.
With the support of over 220,000 retailers, Apple Pay has gained a good amount of leverage in the retail market. Major credit card companies such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express all participate in Apple Pay. Large corporate banks, including Bank of America, Citi, Chase and Wells Fargo are in agreement to partner with Apple Pay. In addition to the major banks, Apple Pay will continue to expand in the future; it has already enlisted other banks such as U.S. Bank and the Navy Federal Credit Union as future participants within the next year. Famous retail chains such as Whole Foods, Chevron and McDonalds are just a few examples of where this new payment method can be used.
Recently, President Barack Obama signed the ŌĆ£Buy SecureŌĆØ initiative to implement and secure quick change among consumer payment options in large retail stores. By Oct. 1, 2015, fraud liability will shift to the least EMV-compliant party among major U.S. credit card issuers, including MasterCard, Visa, Discover and American Express. Such necessity for change has garnered the attention of major retailers across the nation to adopt inventive programs such as Apple Pay.
Apple Pay, unlike Google Wallet and other virtual payment methods, offers promising upgrades to security and privacy for users. At a time when data breaches and fraudulence have become prevalent, Apple Pay has made great progress on the issue of security. The system is unique because the software uses tokenization, a secure method in electronic payments. The method does not store a userŌĆÖs credit card information on the phone or anywhere else, but┬Ā rather creates a single-use code, which expires and becomes irrelevant to hackers. The single-use code also solves the issue of privacy by linking to expiration of personal user data after the transaction.
The individual userŌĆÖs credit card transaction can only be authorized with a fingerprint. Numbers and credit card information are stored within the iPhoneŌĆÖs special feature called ŌĆ£iPhoneŌĆÖs Secure Element,ŌĆØ which stores the data and is separate from the iCloud.
These upgrades pose major changes to the conventional use of credit card payment. With the touch of a fingerprint, users have a sense of control over both privacy and security. Under Apple Pay, users will presumably no longer have to fear fraudulent credit card transactions.
The urgency of President ObamaŌĆÖs executive order for retailers to transition to the EMV-standard reveals how significant of an innovation Apple Pay really is. Economically, Apple Pay truly ensures financial security. Technologically, Apple Pay implements a sense of effortless, straightforward and painless accessibility. Socially, Apple Pay integrates the continuous growth of social media to promote even easier methods to online and in-person pay.
It seems Apple has scored in the market again, this time with points that will generate positive output for generations to come. Its ability to secure usersŌĆÖ credit card information and employ an easier method to paying at the register will make it the modern form of credit card transactions.
Apple didn’t revolutionize anything!  Google Wallet’s been around for several years now!  God, the ignorance of this article is cringe worthy.

On Tuesday, the unmanned Antares rocket, built by private firm Orbital Sciences, exploded after lift-off in Virginia. The explosion is the first NASA-contracted accident since the agency cancelled its Space Shuttle Program and turned to the private sector for missions that include ferrying cargo to space stations. It launches into the public discourse the stability and efficacy of NASA’s funding and contracting with private firms. If a promising future of space exploration is to be had, missions and research need to be placed in the hands of NASA alone.
In 2011, NASA closed down operation of its Space Shuttle Program and began to reach out to companies such as Orbital Sciences and SpaceX to sign resupply contracts. Since few companies are currently capable of performing human flight into space, the United States pays roughly $70.7 million per seat to hitch a ride on Russia’s rockets. Many proponents of the privatization of space exploration seem to view contracting private firms as an investment that offers the opportunity to build more reliable and technologically advanced rockets and material.
Yet, as the explosion after lift-off from Wallops Island demonstrates, this approach can also have serious drawbacks. A once mighty force and symbol of American strength and power, NASA isn’t what it used to be. It’s hard to imagine the country that was the first — and only — nation to put a man on the moon now pays inflated dollars to its former space-race opponent.
Space exploration is the quintessential American form of might. Wielding influence and power, NASA was the mechanism through which the United States demonstrated to the world its true capabilities for success. Russia’s space exploration, for much of the latter part of the 20th century, has struggled in comparison to the success of the Apollo program. NASA has brought so much to a distinct American culture: images and audio recordings of Neil Armstrong on the moon, the first photo ever taken from Mars and awe-inspiring shots of far-out galaxies and stars that have been the backdrops of so many science fiction works. NASA has accomplished great feats, but now faces setbacks due to political maneuvering by both sides of the aisle. In particular, the Obama administration, which has expressed support of NASA, but has acted otherwise with proposals like the steep 2014 NASA budget cuts.
Though Orbital Sciences is currently facing immense issues after losing almost $300 million in market value due to the crash, the issue lies not in the companies themselves, but the fragmenting nature of privatization. Though competition promotes innovation, in such a complex and meticulously orchestrated operation like rocket launches, it requires a unified effort that builds on itself rather than rival companies battling for contracts and funding.
While the world battles the Ebola epidemic, the rise of ISIS and human rights violations all over the globe, space exploration is on the back burner in terms of priorities and funding allocation. People need to remember that space programs not only strengthen the United States on the world stage, but also create thousands of jobs. Rather than exclusively contracting private firms for various space missions, it would be advantageous for NASA to take the lead and control operations to continue a marvelous feat in human history.
Orbital Sciences’ rocket explosion shouldn’t be viewed as a defeat or step back in the field, but rather as an event that has catapulted the debate of space exploration back onto the world stage. The mission of the Antares rocket might not have been directly related to exploration, but its planned venture into the depths of space still draws attention back to the future of the industry and the need for it to move to the forefront once again. It is incumbent on NASA to helm the reins and continue to lead not only the United States, but also the world with its exploration of the final frontier.

Spacex will try to land its next booster on a floating platform. Eventually they will succeed and we’ll wonder why we ever threw away all that expensive hardware to begin with when all it really took to reuse it was 3 or 4 cheap legs and the will to design a control system to bring the things back. That one development is going to make space travel even more economical than the people who sold us the Space Shuttle ever dared to promise, and will lead to a vastly expanded manned space program. And one that may well become self-supporting. NASA will again have its glory days exploring farther out. Oh, and I think Elon Musk might just be wondering if he can find a way to implement a warp drive. lol
NASA’s own cost models estimated that it would have taken them 4-10 times as much money to replicate the capability of the Falcon 9 rocket.  Spurred on by SpaceX’s success, ULA is now allied with Blue Origin and we’re seeing the first companies targeting the smallsat launch market emerge.
With the reality of flat spending for NASA, at best, the move to services-based contracting from cost-plus accounting was long overdue. Congress has made it abundantly clear they have no intention of raising the space exploration budget – as evidenced by their wholesale rejection of the President’s 2010 plan for the Flagship Technology Demonstrations Program.
The only way NASA will be able to move forward in exploration is to stop spending so much money on getting to orbit that there is little left to do anything meaningful once it gets there.
What you’re referring to as ‘privatization’ is simply a different way of handling SOME of the contracted work.  NASA has always contracted work with companies like Boeing, Lockheed, (and earlier Martin Marietta, McDonnell-Douglas, and the like).  It’s the method of contracting the work is what has changed FOR SOME PARTS of the program.  Decisions based solely on Congressional Pork and unlimited budget overruns are no longer automatic with the newer method.  Given the two shuttle accidents, Apollo 1, and numerous unmanned mission failures in the past, it’s seems a bit premature to state that the new method won’t work based upon only one incident.

It is hard to ignore the featured artist list on Dillon Francis’s new album Money Sucks, Friends Rule, but it is even harder to ignore any of the hits that have been released off the album in the last few weeks. With everyone from Panic! At The Disco’s Brendon Urie to Major Lazer and DJ Snake, Money Sucks, Friends Rule is already a strong contender for the best electronic album of the year.

There’s been a growing contingent of American electronic music artists of late, and Dillon Francis is, along with some of his features, at the forefront right now. His first studio album is full of bangers, but I would expect nothing less from the Mad Decent artist.
Mad Decent, a record label spearheaded by electronic music godfather Diplo, has a history of producing some of the world’s top dance acts. Dillon Francis is joined by the likes of RiFF RAFF, DJ Snake and many others on the label, putting him in a strong position to release Money Sucks, Friends Rule, and it does not disappoint.
Because of the “one-hit wonder” nature of the genre, it is odd to review an electronic music album, but our culture is in the middle of a tech boom, and even popular music has become digital. If there ever was a time to review electronic music, this would be it, as the Billboard Hot 100 features a slew of electronic artists — and it doesn’t seem like the genre is leaving the mainstream any time soon. Francis is one such artist in the mainstream, and he’s put together hits that can not only stand alone, but work cohesively together, which is rare in electronic music. It is easy to put this album on and party all the way through, and each track can also be dropped into a playlist and hold its own.
“Get Low” is probably the strongest song on the album, as Francis collaborated with DJ Snake, the brains behind the white girl anthem of 2013, “Turn Down For What.” It is simple, with only one line, “Get low when the whistle blow,” but it has all the makings of a Euro-club banger, complete with booming bass, that unforgettable hook and a horn section modelled after Arabian dance music that is impossible to get out of your head. A clip of a DJ Snake yelling “Yalla Habibi,” an Arabic phrase used here to beckon a girl to the dance floor, can be heard throughout.
In contrast to the more traditionally electronic “Get Low,” “Love in the Middle of a Firefight” features full verses and a chorus from the uniquely voiced Brendon Urie, lead singer of everyone’s middle school favorite, Panic! At The Disco.
Though Panic! has fallen off in the Billboard charts since their debut album, A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out, Urie and the scenester rock band have continued to make fresh music, and scored a hit on the charts again with last year’s “Miss Jackson.”
Obviously Urie has kept busy, and lending his voice to Francis’s track feels like a fresh take on an old classic. The track is a slow anthem packaged perfectly for radio success, which I would normally use to discredit a song, as radio these days is feeling increasingly stale. This song, however, has something indescribably fresh. Assuming radio stations don’t beat us over the head with it for the next year, it will stay on my short list of solid driving tunes.
Last on the list is “Drunk All the Time,” a love song that also serves as a commentary on today’s culture. The simple bass beats and Daft Punk-esque instrumentals are solid, and singer Simon Lord’s vocals are perfect, but what really makes this track a hit is the relatable lyrics about love in today’s world.
The chorus repeats “Being with you / I feel drunk all the time,” a contrast to love songs from a previous era. Today’s culture often praises hookup culture, which, however negatively you may see it, is a part of many students’ lives. This song is a positive portrayal of a drunk hookup, and though some may disagree, there is nothing wrong with the concept. It describes a love story in modern times, and features a beautifully crafted backing track, making this song an instant hit.
Dillon Francis has a strong following, especially considering this is his first actual album, and it is probably because of how in tune he is with today’s culture. Electronic dance music is still the genre of the times, and Francis’s Money Sucks, Friends Rule, is a great starter album if you’re just getting into it.

The last time USC saw the spunky, animated rock outfit New Politics was a brief six months ago at USC Springfest. David Boyd, the band’s frontman, was bouncing around the stage, climbing the scaffolding and thrusting his pointed finger at receptive members of the audience. He even discarded his mic to perform an elaborate breakdance routine only to be greeted with a roar of approval from a crowd that was largely unfamiliar with his work.
Déjà vu · New Politics played at USC just six months ago at Springfest. Since then, they’ve become better known because of their single “Harlem.” – Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
“Dancing is something I do every show, and I can’t help it,” Boyd said. “It goes hand-in-hand with music; It’s emotion. It’s expression. And it’s something I’ve been doing since I can remember.”
Fast forward half a year. Boyd and New Politics have seen a surge in popularity owing to their catchy, thumping punk-rock anthem “Harlem,” a track that reflects their adjustment to America since departing Denmark. Boyd said he never could have anticipated that one single would catapult the band into new territory that includes an expanding audience, more opportunities to play larger venues and their second tour as headliners.
“Of course it takes so much more than that, but I never realized what a single song could do. I’m really blown away by it,” Boyd said. “It’s important to have a single, but I think that song has a lot of power, which is really important because it opens up a lot of gems we have as a band.”
New Politics has been tapped to open by a number of impressive, established artists — everyone from 30 Seconds to Mars and Fall Out Boy to Paramore and P!nk. For Boyd, who revels in the live performance as much as the recorded product, the touring experiences have been instrumental.
“They’ve inspired me to learn to grow and make the best of what you’re given,” Boyd said. “One of the things I’ve realized is that a lot of it has to do with my perseverance and finding an outcome, a way to better yourself or change in a constructive way.”
Boyd thinks they’ve done just that with their upcoming third album, Vikings, which he calls their best yet. New Politics’ members have developed as songwriters and the band’s rising status has fueled a number of upbeat, positive tracks that reflect its excitement for what’s to come.
“There are a few sad things about being single and maybe not finding love, but there’s also a lot of fun aspects about falling in love with America and everything we’ve gone through,” Boyd said. “It’s a very cloud-nine record. We’re definitely on cloud-nine.”
Their new record also promises to maintain the genre fluidity and versatility that New Politics has embodied over the years. The band, though undoubtedly influenced by rock and punk, can lean pop at times and incorporate elements of hip-hop at others. Boyd said the band doesn’t abide by genres or try to classify itself — it relies on what feels genuine.
“Our sound, I think, comes from different feelings. It’s like a vibe,” Boyd said. “It’s an electric feeling or vibe that sparks, and I don’t think that that can get approached like a genre. It starts to take root and build its own life.”
This variability is part of what led them to open for such a diverse set of artists, but the band’s personality and presence also plays a large role. After “Harlem” exploded, the band discovered its strength in live, enthusiastic performances and has continued to hone its natural charisma.
Unlike bands like 30 Seconds to Mars, New Politics doesn’t have full access to all of the technology and props of huge spectacles. Instead, they rely on their energy and embrace simplicity.
“We’re not flying from things. We don’t have special lights or anything that. Our show is very raw,” Boyd said. “There are no gimmicks. It’s just raw energy. Anything that seems like a gimmick isn’t.”
At Springfest, this included serenading the students gathered in McCarthy Quad with a Justin Timberlake track. The band would mess around singing covers in rehearsal and translated the result to the stage. It was an instant success, met with recognition and encouragement from fans.
Though they don’t have fireworks and confetti blasters yet, Boyd said that the band has put a lot of energy into their light show and production. This tour marks their second trip headlining, and though they’re still adjusting to the learning curve, the response they’ve received has been electric.
New Politics expects to translate their passion to their two performances this weekend at the House of Blues on Halloween in Anaheim and the next day at the Fonda Theatre. Boyd wouldn’t divulge much about his plans for the Halloween performance, but he did said the band members would definitely dress up — and he encouraged everyone else in attendance to do the same.

There’s definitely something off about Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), the bottom-feeding crime reporter whose grisly nocturnal activities propel writer-director Dan Gilroy’s sensational new thriller Nightcrawler, a venomous media satire sharp enough to draw blood.
Meet the creeper · Jake Gyllenhaal plays unscrupulous crime reporter Lou Bloom in writer-director Dan Gilroy’s nocturnal thriller Nightcrawler, which was filmed on-location in Los Angeles in the dead of night. – Photo courtesy of Bold Films
Lou has what Shakespeare called “a lean and hungry look,” a description that, when applied to Lou, has less to do with the character’s gaunt, borderline ghoulish appearance than the ravenous, all-consuming scope of his ambition to become the alpha scavenger in the amoral annals of Los Angeles’s local television news scene.
It’s difficult to pin down what exactly makes Lou so far removed from the rest of humanity. Maybe it’s the way his cold, sunken eyes glimmer with such rapacious inquisitiveness. Maybe it’s his tight-lipped smile, so strained and artificial, parting only to spout off reams of learned-by-rote huckster aphorisms, managerial doublespeak and carefully worded threats. Or maybe it’s simply the fact that he makes his living by exploiting his subjects on what’s already the worst day of their lives — and that’s assuming they’re still alive. One can almost envision the lettering on the character’s favorite coffee mug: “You don’t have to be a sociopath to do this job, but it helps!”
When we first meet Lou, he’s an unemployed but intensely driven loner with ill-defined dreams of one day ascending the corporate ladder. One night, on the way home from selling copper wire and stolen manhole covers for rent money, the troubled young man stumbles upon a fiery car wreck on the freeway. There he meets the gruff, abrasive Joe (Bill Paxton), a freelance videographer, or “nightcrawler,” who sells graphic accident and crime scene footage to local news stations for a pretty penny. Lou, intrigued by Joe’s invocation of the old newsroom adage, “If it bleeds, it leads,” and untouched by even the faintest prickling of moral accountability, immediately buys a cheap camcorder, scores a police scanner and dives headlong into what he views as a promising new career.
Sure enough, it turns out Lou has a terrific eye for capturing carnage, and before long he becomes the go-to nightcrawler for a ratings-starved news station and its ruthless producer Nina (Rene Russo), who tells the fledgling videographer to think of the ideal news story as “a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut.”
As the plot thickens, it becomes obvious that Nina will run just about anything Lou brings her, no matter how violent or depraved, and their already unusual business arrangement takes on a far more sinister (not to mention kinky) bent as Sweeps Week draws closer and closer. Lou, realizing he’s become an invaluable asset to the station, starts living increasingly high on the hog: demanding better pay, swapping out his rusty hatchback sedan for a souped-up Dodge Challenger and hiring a jittery, Sancho Panza-esque assistant (Riz Ahmed from the morbidly brilliant suicide bomber comedy Four Lions) to help him run down his stories.
The revelation that the news — specifically local newscasts — has devolved into a voyeuristic, ratings-fueled bloodsport populated by well-coifed predators isn’t exactly a late-breaking development — films such as Network, Broadcast News and To Die For have hammered home that point before — but the idea has never been explored with this much visual vitality and skewering wit.
After taking Lou under her wing, Nina tells him to focus on documenting crimes against the wealthy by inner-city minorities, using the fear of urban encroachment to drive a spike in viewership among suburban households. Later, when Lou misses out on a big story and attempts to substitute coverage of a lesser crime in a less moneyed neighborhood, the battle-hardened Nina reminds her eager protégé that in the nightly hunt for relevance and exclusivity, the end justifies the extreme: “I want something people can’t turn away from.”
The film’s cast is uniformly excellent. Gyllenhaal, who previously demonstrated his chops for playing unstable eccentrics as the eponymous protagonist in Donnie Darko and a damaged-goods detective in last year’s Prisoners, turns in his finest performance to date as a man unbound by the laws of common decency.
Russo, a tough and gorgeous presence who’s been sadly absent from the screen for the past nine years aside from her blink-and-you’ll-miss-them appearances in the Thor movies, tears into the role of Nina with the relish of a gifted performer starved for worthy material. Gilroy is her real-life husband, so it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine the part was written with her in mind. Regardless, she absolutely nails Nina’s hard-bitten cynicism while simultaneously projecting the faded, wistful glamour of a talented journalist who still pines for her time in front of the camera. Paxton, meanwhile, makes the most of his brief screentime as Joe, a loathsome, profane slob who gluts himself on human misery.
The real star of Nightcrawler, however, is Los Angeles itself. This will go down in history as one of the quintessential L.A. movies, fit to stand with the likes of Double Indemnity, Chinatown, Collateral and Drive. As seen through the roving, hypnotic eye of There Will Be Blood director of photography Robert Elswit, the City of Angels transforms into a neon-soaked empire of deferred dreams and self-delusion. Gilroy, a veteran screenwriter making his directorial debut, chose to shoot the film on-location under cover of darkness, and this blending of familiar locations with the ephemera of night cuts to the very heart of what makes Los Angeles the strange and wondrous place it is: the kind of beautiful you never turn your back on. After all, it’s difficult to think of another city that could produce a creature as perversely fascinating as Lou Bloom.
