More than four years after thinking of an idea for the script while eating lunch at Parkside Dining Hall, Logan Austin’s first-ever movie has finally reached completion. A screenwriting major who graduated from USC in 2017, Austin’s forthcoming film Progidy tells the story of a teenage genius who graduates college at the age of 16, only to return to high school to recapture a childhood she feels she missed out on.

The title Progidy hints at a running joke in the film, and was Austin’s attempt at capturing the overall premise of the movie into a single word.
“We came up with it before we had a reason for it, since the script’s original title was ‘A Small Pun,’” he said. “But at the start of the summer before shooting, we thought it would be cool to have it be a symbol [of her story]. ‘Prodigy’ is the label she was given as a child, and then ‘progidy’ is that, but given its own unique spin on it, which is what her arc in the movie is about.”
Through comically light-hearted mishaps, character revelations and unmistakable high school vulgarity, the movie follows the main character Stephanie through her “senior year” as she furiously attempts to check off her list of requirements for the perfect high school experience. Initially, Austin had a more dramatic, troubling story in mind, but as the film developed, the plot began to take a different turn. 
“I was eating lunch and it just popped into my head: ‘What happens when a child prodigy just gives up?’” he said. “So originally I was going to make it much more sad, more about being a failure, instead of about accepting limitations.”
Somewhat based on his own high school experience as the ultra-driven student who sought to branch out and expand his social life as graduation approached, Austin even filmed the movie at McIntosh High School, his alma mater in Peachtree City, Ga. He tapped several of his best friends from school to serve as his crew, and filled many of the casting roles with other classmates who had prior acting experience.
Without a network of people willing to help him turn the script into a reality, Austin doubts the film would have been possible.
“It was born out of a community, it wasn’t born out of a person,” he said. “I don’t think I could have made this movie if I had been an introvert in high school, because I knew a ton of people who I was on reasonably good terms with, where they would say, ‘Yeah, I can dedicate a day to being in your movie,’ or others who dedicated a whole summer to the project.”
Their commitment proved essential to Austin, especially in the face of an avalanche of setbacks that occurred during the filming and editing processes that followed. After a failed Kickstarter campaign forced him to rethink his financial strategy, Austin picked up a summer job waiting tables and dipped into his savings to fund the project. Still, his final budget was less than half of the original $8,000 he planned to have available, an adjustment that severely impacted the sound quality while on set.
“We had a shotgun microphone, a $20 crappy pre-amp, and then a TASCAM voice recorder, and we had to strap them all with zip-ties to a piece of PVC,” he said. “We had to use paper clips as part of the wiring, it led to a lot of buzzing and mechanical clicks during the sound. We ended up using camera audio for a lot of it, which is probably worse.”
Despite the complications, however, Austin is pleased with how the movie came about, and made a note of things to improve on for future productions. New discoveries on set eased the pain of prior plans that fell through, and made for a final product that took on a life of its own thanks to the individual influences that various cast members brought to the table.
“It was messy, but I’m happy with how it turned out,” he said. “We were always open to things popping up while shooting and taking their place in the movie, so it evolved so much from what the original draft had been.”
Austin is currently submitting Progidy to various film festivals, and plans to release it online once the process concludes The movie doesn’t yet have an official release date, but he hopes to screen the film at USC in the near future.

Kobunga Korean Grill, a fast-food Korean barbecue restaurant, celebrated its grand opening at USC Village on Saturday. With homemade kimchi and classic Korean meat dishes as well as gluten-free and vegan side dishes, Kobunga provides tasty, filling meals while keeping up with the fast-paced college student lifestyle. 
While eating at typical Korean barbecue restaurants can be a multi-hour experience, Kobunga Grill translates the traditional menu into a fast-food setting that fits an on-the-go lifestyle. Photo from Yelp.
Founder and CEO John Kim created the restaurant to make access to Korean barbecue more convenient. Most Korean barbecue restaurants charge a flat fee per guest and require customers to grill their own meat, meaning that a meal can take hours, especially if they want to get their money’s worth in meat. By simplifying the process to ordering from a set menu and waiting a few minutes to get fresh, hot food, Kim is able to bring the Korean barbecue experience to more people. 
His business began with introducing Kobunga to Los Angeles’ night markets, such as the KTOWN Night Market and the 626 Night Market, and doing catering for entertainment companies such as Netflix and Hulu last year. The USC Village is Kobunga’s first permanent location, where guests can choose to create their own plate which comes with two sides, or select from a list of signature plates and salads. 
Tender pork belly with burnt sugar crust and thinly sliced beef bulgogi are the most popular dishes, according to Kim. In fact, if you ask for the tender pork belly at around 6:30 p.m., they might already be sold out for the day. Still, the bulgogi is delicious when paired with roasted sweet potatoes and Korean cabbage slaw. For those who are overwhelmed by the vast amount of choices, however, you can’t go wrong with signature plates such as the USC Special, the Mama Kim or the Mama Cho. 
Kim understands that people may be averse to some Asian cuisines because of dietary restrictions or certain ingredients. That’s why, with the exception of their meat dishes, Kobunga’s dishes are all gluten-free, vegan and do not contain fish sauce, dairy or MSG. Soft tofu with spicy garlic soy sauce is offered as a vegetarian option, and can also be ordered as the signature plate. Prices range from $9 to $12. 
These delicious dishes are made by Stephen Cho, chef and COO of Kobunga. Through his cooking, he strives to share his Korean American heritage. Cho makes the kimchi side dishes himself, through the traditional Korean practice known as kimjang. During the winter, Koreans prepare ingredients such as white radish, garlic and ginger to stuff the pickled cabbage. While fermentation usually takes several days, Cho has shortened the process to one day in order to keep up with customer demand and provide fresh kimchi every day. Napa cabbage kimchi and cucumber kimchi pickles are available as side dishes, as well as honey roasted carrots, pickled jalapeños and sautéed corn. 
In terms of beverages, customers can grab a can of Shikhye, Let’s Be Coffee and Sac Sac, or order plum lemonade, yuzu lemonade or seasonal iced tea (currently green tea). While the menu is still expanding to include more seasonal items, patrons have already taken express interest in Kobunga. In fact, on Wednesday, Kobunga will cater the celebration reception for the naming of the Bohnett Residential College at USC Village.
Although there is no seating inside the restaurant, guests can enjoy a take-out meal in the USC Village Piazza. Kobunga is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day.

Long before I became the “aloof and inauthentic” asshole that I am today, I was into detective novels. I devoured every one of Agatha Christie’s “cozies,” featuring the mustachioed dandy Hercule Poirot and the sweetly benign Miss Marple, whose mild appearances, all prim and proper, belied their razor-sharp intellect. Then I transitioned into stories that were a little rougher around the edges: Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, the undisputed kings of noir. Their cynical, antihero detectives Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, who rolled with the punches and relaxed with a glass of whiskey, inhabited a world full of peril and intrigue, where danger lurked around every grimy street corner. 
Pulp fiction is not, perhaps, the most intellectual genre of literature, but I loved it nonetheless. I loved trying to crack the case as I read, loved unraveling the puzzle of “whodunnit,” even loved falling into the author’s trap and casting the blame in the direction that they were pointing me in. I was so cocksure, so certain that I’d caught the real perp this time. I was always wrong. 
I’d like to say that I’ve grown out of it, and that nowadays everything I read is exclusively experimental, incomprehensible and James Joyce-esque, but in truth, my heart will always lie with private eyes. Imagine my glee, then, when I discovered that the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive. 
Paul Auster’s The New York Trilogy is one of my favorite novels of all time. Combining my two beloved literary genres — postmodernism and detective fiction — I firmly believe that this book and I are soulmates. It’s sly and ironic, subversive and meta as hell; in short, it’s everything I strive to be both in my writing and just as a person, really.

The New York Trilogy is divided into three parts: City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room. In part one, an author of detective novels, Daniel Quinn, receives a frantic midnight call from someone who believes he will soon be murdered. He is looking for “Paul Auster, the private investigator.” This is exactly the shot of adrenaline that Quinn needs to enliven his humdrum life; he successfully passes himself off as “Auster,” but once he becomes embroiled in the case, which drags on and on with no end in sight, his mind begins to unravel. 
In part two, the story shifts to an entirely different narrative, where the characters are christened as colors: a P.I., Blue, is hired by a client, White, to trail Black, who lives on Orange Street. Blue fully immerses himself into the life of Black, and — surprise, surprise — also starts to lose his grip on reality. Surreal and symbolic, the constant surveillance that Blue subjects himself to lends the story a tense, disquieting effect. 
Finally, in part three, the narrator, an unnamed protagonist, is shocked to learn that his childhood friend, Fanshawe, a successful novelist, has vanished out of the blue. The narrator completes and publishes Fanshawe’s unfinished work, which is hailed as a masterpiece; he consoles Fanshawe’s family, eventually marrying a carbon copy of his wife and adopting his son; and, gradually, assumes his old friend’s identity. But are his actions entirely of his own volition … or has Fanshawe set him up? 
The New York Trilogy isn’t just another straightforward mystery novel, with a clear, tidy resolution; answers are not provided, gaping wide plot holes are never stitched up and you will most definitely put the book down incredulously mouthing, as I did, “What?! What?!” Auster plays with themes of identity and reality, sanity and free will, the woeful inadequacy but also fundamental necessity of language as a form of communication. The mixed reviews are a testament to its polarizing nature; readers either love it or hate it, but rarely are they indifferent to it once they reach the last page. It’s evident that I’m squarely in the “love it” camp, but no matter where you end up falling on the spectrum, The New York Trilogy is, without a doubt, a must-read.

The word “education” appears in the Constitution exactly zero times. The 10th Amendment specifically states that everything not under the federal government’s jurisdiction in the Constitution is reserved exclusively for the states or the people to decide. 
Consequently, the federal government can fund public education, but it cannot write the curriculum; that is a job for state-run commissions. As such, the education system varies state-by-state. 
Public education extends past grade school, into high school and college. With that said, it should not be surprising that states like Arizona are funding their public universities and suggesting classes with specific, conservative and traditional curriculum in the course list. 
That being said, the argument that state legislatures are pushing for a more conservative college education is unfounded. The Arizona state legislature approved allocating $7 million to public state colleges, where they plan on recruiting six new professors with intellectually conservative backgrounds and obtaining first editions of the Federalist Papers and Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations. 
Indeed, adding six conservative professors to Arizona State may give students crucial, additional exposure to conservative ideology they presently lack, given the overwhelming liberal majority in academia. It is unlikely this will overshadow students’ exposure to liberal ideas. Rather, the Arizona initiative gives students a more balanced education. Additionally, learning about the Federalist Papers in college through new classes produced by these curriculum changes is not part of a conservative curriculum.

Distinctly different from this programing is a policy being considered in the Louisiana state legislature that threatens to withhold funding from the university if its football players refuse to stand for the National Anthem. Athletic funding should not be a political issue; state legislatures should be promoting college campuses with diverse viewpoints. Universities should provide access to multiple viewpoints for students because they have a right to know all sides of an issue, including the issue of protesting the National Anthem. 
But opponents to the other measures argue that the new curriculum’s addition of more Western writers is an attack on the liberal arts. This could not be further from truth: most texts authored by Western thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes and their counterparts do not project a single, decisive ideology of any kind. Rather, their philosophies are interdisciplinary and well-rounded. Adding these texts to certain classes will only spark discussions, debates and disagreements, which will educate students about conflicting viewpoints and allow them to make their own informed decisions. 
Of course, this is not to say that we should not study more contemporary texts. There is enormous value in studying modern theories, texts written by women and works by authors of color. But nobody is suggesting that states should remove these texts from the curriculum. The argument that conservative state legislatures just plan to study “dead white men” is simply untrue. 
College education has a fundamental difference that sets it apart from secondary education: Students have much greater opportunity to choose which classes to take. More classes — such as economic classes about capitalism as well as socialism — give students more choice, which is never a bad thing. 
Universities that do not offer a wide range of academic courses are simply failing in their duty to educate their students. Schools that do not present all sides of political, economic or social issues are depriving their students of the choice to make up their own minds and are depriving their students of a quality, balanced education.

The war for ideological control of our nation’s universities is underway, and in Arizona, conservatives have taken charge. This week, The New York Times’ Stephanie Saul explored the efforts of Arizona legislators to earmark millions of dollars in funding for pet projects, professors and courses aimed at advancing conservative ideas in Arizona’s public state universities — in the form of the new School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership at Arizona State University and the Department of Political Economy and Moral Science at the University of Arizona. 
Lawmakers shouldn’t be telling universities what to teach, and they definitely shouldn’t be handpicking new (conservative) professors in an effort to “de-liberalize” the modern university campus. In doing so, these lawmakers are engaging in the kind of government overreach that they selectively abhor. Moreover, the rationale that some of these leaders use to justify the practice misunderstands the role of diverse coursework.
“There is too much revisionism being taught in universities today,” Arizona State Representative Jay Lawrence, a supporter of the new programs, told The New York Times. “It’s a big deal to those of us who feel very strongly about a more conservative education.”
University classes invoking diverse perspectives — the history of Native Americans in colonial and modern America, for example, or the history of the LGBTQ struggle in the Western world — are not revisionist; they are correcting for revisionist history taught in our nation’s public schools. They are correcting for the omittance of the narratives of Native American, or LGBTQ, or Asian American, or Latinx, or black people in so many students’ K-12 education. They are providing an important role in informing our young people and future leaders of the darker sides of American history, and of the pivotal historical struggles of marginalized groups who collectively form a majority of American society.

To replace these with more classes emphasizing the ideas of Aristotle or Aristophanes — philosophers highlighted in two courses backed by the Arizona legislature — is both redundant and amounts to serious erasure of diverse American experiences. The online course catalog shows that ASU will offer 11 Greek courses, 12 Latin courses and 77 philosophy courses, none of which indicate that they might be Eastern philosophy courses, in Fall 2018. Is the emergence of diverse coursework really so threatening that we need even more of the nearly 100 classes already offered on Western thought? 
Some might argue that new classes studying the ideas of Western philosophers do not replace those that explore diverse histories, ideas and experiences. But since 2008, the Arizona Legislature has slashed general fund revenue for Arizona universities by $390 million, resulting in a $1,200 reduction in funding per student when adjusted for inflation. So, in the face of steep budget cuts, ASU might very well be facing choices about whether to cut or reduce smaller, more diverse departments and majors like Latin American Studies, American Indian Studies and Asian Pacific American Studies. Moreover, if not to support those departments, the millions of dollars that have been invested in these new schools could be much better utilized to provide essential support and resources for students. 
The Arizona Legislature’s desire to refocus universities’ academic emphasis on European, male-dominated schools of thought is a direct, aggressive response to the diversification of academia and to the popular perceptions of universities as liberal bastions. But universities are not places of ideological indoctrination, and if expanding academia to include more diverse perspectives makes Western thought less dominant, then so be it. If conservatives really want the ideas of ancient male European thinkers to stand the test of time, then those ideas should compete on equal footing with those of the modern, diverse thinkers — like W.E.B. Du Bois and Angela Davis — that are introduced in classes exploring the literature and history of marginalized people. Universities don’t need to expand the coursework and departments that are already institutionally robust; instead, they should be making more room for the perspectives that have been historically ignored. 
We can’t pretend earmarked funding for specialized schools focused on conservative ideas is anything other than an attempt to overwrite efforts for diversification. It is not making room for debate; debate is open, vigorous and free at public universities — especially today, when media attention around controversial speakers has placed universities under a microscope. This latest effort is simply a manifestation of anger at the changing ideological fabric of the young people of America.
This is the pain of change. In the year following the Supreme Court ruling in favor of marriage equality, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs found a 17 percent increase in hate killings toward LGBTQ people. The election of President Donald Trump, who called some neo-Nazis “very fine people,” followed that of former President Barack Obama, the first black president of the United States. And the diversification of the university is followed by efforts to revert it to a more conservative institution.
There’s a lot of work to be done. Advocates need to keep challenging the status quo and holding lawmakers accountable; and the rest of us need to support them, too.

Members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association sat down with students Monday to discuss their experiences as film journalists and comment on this past awards season, which included much more political activism than in past years with the rise of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements.
Photo by Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
According to the panelists, covering this awards season has been different than any other because of those movements. They said that much of their coverage this season has focused on them.
Jenny Cooney, host of the podcast “Aussies in Hollywood,” commented on the responsibility of the press to decide what stories to cover, especially when many of the stories start out as unverified posts on social media.
“For many, many years women spoke up and nobody believed them,” Cooney said. “Now the pendulum has swung so far the other way… that anytime anybody speaks up even if it’s one woman on Facebook then everybody believes them … and then the person that’s being accused of something is still just being accused of something and yet it feels like they’ve already been tried and convicted of something in the press.”
This year’s Golden Globes posed an issue for organizers, as they didn’t know what to expect from attendees in terms of activism. There were rumors that Golden Globe attendees were going to march before the event, according to Cooney. That, however, did not end up being the case.
At these events, artists have used their platforms to spread political messages. While this has sometimes been met with backlash, some of the panelists said that there is nothing wrong with doing so if the opportunity is provided.
“What is wrong with using this platform to say something that can raise consciousness, that can make people think?” said Silvia Bizio, a journalist who works for the Republicca Newspaper in Italy.
While the Golden Globes this year were defined by many political statements, the panelists believe that this Sunday’s Oscars will be much less political.
Journalist Scott Orlin, who works for Cinema Magazine Germany, believes that because the Oscars are a more prestigious award ceremony than the Golden Globes, artists are less likely to make controversial statements at the event. Cooney further mentioned what she called “Oscar fatigue,” in which the public becomes tired of hearing the same stories repeated since the beginning of the awards season, minimizing the presence of politics.
Marlene Von Arx, a freelance writer in Switzerland, also questioned how long the focus on these issues would last since it is rare for issues to stay in the public eye for extended periods of time.
“When will the fatigue come in?” she said. “I wonder how long it will be here to stay.”
Julianne Myers, a sophomore studying public relations, said she appreciated that the panelists didn’t try to hide the challenges of their jobs.
“They were talking about how sometimes they really feel like they have to struggle with publicists to try and get news and get what they want to get out of it, but also its still really beneficial because they love what they do,” she said.
Morgan Miller, a sophomore studying public relations, felt hopeful about the future of women in the workplace after the panelists’ discussion on the future of the industry.
“I think that when you go into the workplace, I want to feel safe … I think that will change in the future and definitely improve,” she said.

The Trojans’ baseball team completed a sweep over the Villanova Wildcats to maintain their season opening surge. The Trojans extended their winning streak to six games following their opening day loss to Utah Valley and now hold an impressive 6-1 record.

Going into the series, the Trojans were 3-1 while the Wildcats were 3-0 after their emphatic sweep over Norfolk State in their opening series. Prior to the weekend, this series appeared to be a dog fight, but it proved to be otherwise as the Trojans won all three games with relative ease.
In game one, the Wildcats took an early 2-run lead in the second inning. However, it did not last long; the Trojans soon followed by scoring 2 runs in the third inning, and then a resounding 10 runs in the fourth inning to all but seal the game. The Trojans let the Wildcats beat themselves in that game, as Villanova walked them 15 times. Specifically, in the fourth inning when the Trojans scored 10 runs, USC was gifted 11 free bases. They were walked 10 times and redshirt sophomore catcher Kaleb Murphy was hit by a pitch. The Trojans were able to put up 10 runs on two hits, with all of their runs scored with two outs in the fourth inning. 
“The guys made it so they just couldn’t get out of the inning, and I think being able to sustain the inning was huge for us,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “Plus we made them use quite a few pitchers which that can only bode well for the rest of the series.”
The Trojans managed to win game one by a score of 15-6 on only nine hits, marking the second game in a row in which the Trojans had more runs than hits.
In game two, the Trojans got off to an early lead thanks to a grand slam courtesy of sophomore designated hitter Blake Sabol. The Trojans’ hitting didn’t stop in the first inning, as they managed a season-high 17 hits in a 12-6 game two victory.
“When Blake hit the ‘granny’ and, I think we had 5 in the first, that was huge for us because that got us off to the right start after we had scored [15] the night before,” Hubbs said. “So it was big to come out just blazing. I was real pleased with the guys and their effort, they were focused. It’s easy when you have a game that gets separated like it did on Friday for the guys to get lackadaisical, and think, ‘Hey we got this,’ but they came out focused and ready to go.”
Game three felt like a much tighter game than the first two games. Both teams saw spectacular pitching performances on the day, especially USC freshman pitcher Kyle Hurt. After rebounding from a shaky second inning on Sunday, he looked in control of the mound with eight strikeouts through five innings, while only allowing one hit and 1 run.
“I thought today what was big was [Hurt] being able to work through some command issues in the second and give us five on one run,” Hubbs said.  “I mean, that’s huge. Then it gets to our bullpen which was pretty fresh, and none of those four guys had thrown over the weekend, and so that’s been a strength of our team and it was nice to see that.” 
Junior first baseman Dillon Paulson also came up big on Sunday with a 3-run home run in the third inning as the Trojans went on to win 5-2. Paulson became the fourth Trojan this year to go yard, demonstrating that this Trojan team does not just revolve around one or two big-name players. This weekend’s display demonstrated just how important each individual player is to the Trojans’ lineup. Even deep into the batting order, the players were producing when called upon, and eventually came out on top.
“Well I think the theme is a pretty tight team and I don’t think they care who gets it done as long as it gets done, and I think that’s a big thing when you have that in the clubhouse, when you have that in the dugout,” Hubbs said. “I think winning takes care of a lot that. But they believe in each other and they know if they don’t get it done they are rooting for the other guy to get it done. And it’s kind of next man up […] They can rely on a team effort and just concentrate on getting on base and someone’s going to get the big hit when we get there.”
There was one minor blip in an otherwise perfect weekend for the Trojans. While all the players looked impressive, a player that really stood out was freshman shortstop Ben Ramirez. Ramirez came out and hit just about everything on Friday night as he went three for four on the day with a walk and two RBIs. 
Defensively, Ramirez was also superb, notably making an outstanding play in the third inning to save an extra base hit. However, on Saturday, the star freshman was hit by a pitch and broke his hand. According to Hubbs, “[Ramirez] is probably out four to six weeks.”
The Trojans will look to extend their six-game win streak in their next league play game against Loyola Marymount on Tuesday at Dedeaux Field.

Despite winning each of their first 10 matches, USC women’s water polo lost for the first time this season. Falling 9-3 to No. 1 Stanford in the championship match of the Barbara Kalbus Invitational, the Women of Troy found a disappointing end to what was an otherwise strong showing for the squad.
Sophomore driver Kelsey McIntosh has scored 14 goals in the 2018 season, the third most on the Trojans’ squad. Daily Trojan file photo.
“By the end, recovery played a huge role,” head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We were definitely worn out.”
To start out the tournament, action was business as usual for USC. After dismantling No. 18 San Jose State by a 17-1 margin on Friday, the Trojans were off and running. Against the Spartans, nine different players found the back of the net, six managed to score twice, and two (drivers freshman Paige Hauschild and sophomore Denise Mammolito) notched hat tricks. As a team, USC opened up the match with a massive 16-0 run only conceding a late goal in the final seven minutes of play.
On Saturday, USC faced a tough pair of opponents standing between them and a shot at winning a third consecutive Barbara Kalbus title. In the first match of the day, the Trojans took down No. 6 Arizona State 8-6 in a hard fought, back-and-forth affair. Taking a 5-5 tie into the fourth period, USC stepped up when it mattered most, striking three more times to secure the victory before the Sun Devils could find any footing. Senior utility player Annika Jensen became the third Trojan to pick up a hat trick over the course of two games while Hauschild netted her fourth and fifth goals of the tournament.
Moving on to the semi-finals, No. 2 Cal. represented the toughest test the Women of Troy had faced thus far in the 2018 season. Early in the match, the Golden Bears were proving just why they are such a difficult squad to overcome. California came out firing, pinning down USC 3-1 within the first few minutes of the game. The Trojan defense tightened up in the second period and by halftime, the score was knotted up 3-3.
Continuing momentum off a strong end to the half, junior goaltender Amanda Longan dominated the final half of play. In a career-best performance of 18 saves, Longan repelled shot after shot from the dangerous Cal team. Her performance completely shut down Cal for yet another period in the third, allowing USC to take a 5-3 lead into the fourth off goals from senior drivers Brianna Daboub and Jensen. Despite conceding their 2-goal lead, USC found a late spark as Jensen completed her second consecutive hat trick with a clutch score that came with just 18 seconds left in regulation time. 
“[Jensen] stepped up and that’s what you do as a senior,” Vavic said. “I’m excited to see what she can do.”
All that remained for USC to secure a third-straight title was a championship match against No. 1 Stanford. As it turned out, the Trojans’ long stretch of success would finally come to an end. After turning in a number of dominant offensive performances throughout the early season and the first few matches of the tournament, the goal scoring faltered Sunday against Stanford as the Women of Troy fell 9-3 to the Cardinal.
Despite failures to convert on key chances early in the match, USC was down only 3-2 in the second period. At this point, the floodgates opened and Stanford managed to score four consecutive goals until a last-minute score from Trojan freshman driver Verica Bakoc closed the Trojans’ deficit to 7-3 heading into the half. While this margin is certainly within striking range, USC was unable to close the gap as the Cardinal completely shut down the Trojans’ attack for the remainder of the game to take home the title.
Looking ahead, the squad will have a few weeks off before taking on No. 7 UC Irvine on March 7.

I’m tired of hearing about the FBI investigation into the NCAA.
It was good drama for the first few weeks, and it’s certainly kept pretty much every sports journalist in the country busy since last fall. But at this point, I’ve realized that this obsession over recruiting needs to end.
When it comes to systemic issues, bribes are the last thing the NCAA needs to worry about. Part of this issue has to do with paying college athletes. Another part of it has to do with the apparent alter egos of the NCAA — strict on some issues, lax to a point of negligence about others. 
The truth about the NCAA is that it is a business. Although college athletics attempt to hide behind a thinly veiled guise of “amateurism,” that concept has long since been forgotten. In an era when football and basketball teams are billion-dollar ventures, it’s impossible to act as if the athletes and those surrounding them are operating under purely non-professional interests. 
Basketball is a business. Football is a business. And with the continuing insanity of the FBI investigation, it’s becoming harder and harder for the NCAA to act like its athletics are anything but.
At the end of the day, the FBI and the NCAA can do their worst — level sanctions, pull trophies and championship rings, destroy careers and fire employees — but without systemic change, all will remain the same. This wave will be punished, and for a few years perhaps the recruitment craze will die down. But it will never subsist. It will never go away.
And at what cost does all of this enforcement come? The NCAA has dedicated pages of its guidebook in recruitment to the appropriate ways to avoid bribing, and often the organization is focusing on the enforcement of violations that are miniscule — a dinner at P.F. Changs, a couple hundred dollars gifted to family members.
Meanwhile, the NCAA is embroiled in a number of other issues that hardly receive any attention from the organization’s top leaders. In the light of the sexual assault trials of former Team USA women’s gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, it is hard to pretend that all of this controversy over bribes is really all that important.
The NCAA turns a blind eye to issues of violence and sexual assault on a monthly basis, often shielding and protecting predators all the way up to the top of its institution. Every season, we read a new headline — Tyreek Hill, Joe Mixon, the list goes on and on — and for each of these cases there are most likely dozens of others that go unreported and unseen.
Yet what is this organization concerned with? Recruitment rules. The NCAA will fuss and panic over anything from an off-the-books dinner to a $100,000 bribe with absolute intensity and militaristic attention to detail. So why can’t they show the same foresight and care when handling other issues?
And even when it comes to recruitment, the NCAA cares more about money than anything else. The NCAA will write and rewrite rules about who can buy what recruitment, yet it still lacks basic rules about not using sex or “hostesses” — students who are trained to act as glorified escorts for potential recruits, most of whom are underage — despite a gluttony of hostess-related scandals that have plagued college football recruiting in the last two decades.
But recruitment bribes simply aren’t a big enough of a deal to continue to fixate on them so strongly. The NCAA has bigger fish to fry, and by shifting its focus to recruiting debacles rather than actually addressing deeper systemic problems is a form of deflection that is probably more sinister than many fans realize.
This will be an uphill battle. It’s impossible to predict if athletic salaries could help or hurt the NCAA. The notion of paying athletes automatically brings up a seemingly endless series of questions: Who do you pay? How much do you pay? How can this system comply with Title IX?
I won’t pretend to have all of the answers. This is something that will take time and energy. But at this point, something has to give. It’s up to the NCAA to decide what the next step looks like.

Let’s say that someone has been asked to fill out the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 census, and they’re white. How would they answer the question asking about race? 
Art by Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
For years, so long as they weren’t anything other than white, their answer was easy: White. But as of 2020, so long as Congress approves the proposed changes for the 2020 census, white people will be asked to add more detail to their answer. In a box below the initial question, the draft of the census states: “Print, for example, German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, Egyptian, etc.”
While the expansion of measuring ethnic identity is never a bad thing, the reality is that Congress’ proposal doesn’t go far enough to promote real inclusivity. The proposed census changes fail to extend that nuance to more racial categories and ensure that its changes represent the America of young people that exists today — one that the political comedian Hasan Minhaj has called a “New Brown America.” 
At best,  the changes in census collection methods denote an emerging social tide, one contingent on the American notion of “progress” as a barometer of efficiency. But “progress,” a word too commonly thrown around, doesn’t necessarily happen just because something exists. 
Sometimes a change might just be an acknowledgement of nuance. The first year that someone could report being “Hispanic” in the United States was 1980 — at least according to the Census Bureau’s methods of data collection. As of now, one can be white, black, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, American Indian, Asian Indian, Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, Eskimo or Aleut. If, like this writer, one fell into none of these categories, he or she would have been characterized as “Other.” 
In 2000, a little over 200 years after the first census data collection, an option to “mark two or more” finally emerged — a long overdue change. 
But what does the proposed 2020 census change represent exactly? 
Christine Emba, a columnist for the Washington Post, had a couple of smart suggestions: it’s breaking down whiteness’ standing as the norm, it’s making everyone consider a true definition of whiteness, it’s forcing white people to practice empathy for those who have always had a hard time filling out questions about their race or origins. 
One of her most compelling explanations for the change’s implications was also just a statement of fact: “It’s not immediately clear how it will be put to use.” 
Still, the suggested changes might be put to use in ways that are not immediately tied to the collection of census data, but still crucial, at least in the lives of young people: college applications. Under the “Profile” tab of the ubiquitous Common Application, a young applicant is asked to identify his or her race/ethnicity. The question is actually optional. As the Common Application puts it: “The questions in this section, while helpful to colleges, are entirely optional, and you’re welcome to move on without answering them.” 
Regardless, for many young people, a college application form represents their first formal reckoning with their race in an institutional context. 
The language on college applications does not immediately correspond with the methods of the census. For instance, while the “mark one or more” option appeared on the census in 2000 (already a few hundred years late), as The New York Times reported, options to aid in identifying a multiracial identity, namely the option to choose from multiple boxes, on college applications did not appear until 2011. 
At some point, though, the proposed racial category changes to the 2020 census may appear on college applications. If that day comes, what will it mean? 
Currently, the proposed amendments don’t denote progress so much as they do change. 
If the U.S. Census Bureau wants to continue on its trajectory of “progress,” its creators would apply their growing proclivity for specifications in categories where self-identification has always been messier.
Progress, in terms of the proposed 2020 census data collection and its implementation in college applications, would have entailed new, separate checkboxes for people with Middle Eastern or North African roots — which research done by the Census Bureau shows could aid accuracy. It also would have provided better mechanisms for white Egyptians to identify as such. And considering the demographics of young people within the U.S. population, more nuance in the “other” (that is, multiracial) category would have been implemented as well. 
Until the U.S. Census Bureau makes amendments to include more racial and ethnic categories, its changes remain incomplete.
