Some people turn to religion to learn more about the human soul. Tok Thompson, an associate professor of anthropology and communication at USC, turns to ghosts.
At USC, Thompson has helped develop many courses, including his arts and letters course, “Ghost Stories: Throughout Time and Around the World.” Thompson sat down for an interview with the Daily Trojan about his course and the role of ghosts in contemporary life. Thompson will be giving a talk, “Ghosts of the Past, Ghosts of the Future,” on Tuesday from 12 to 1 p.m. at the Social Sciences Building, with Halloween candy and apples included.
Daily Trojan: What got you interested in teaching a course on ghosts at USC?
Tok Thompson: I started off teaching in arts and letters, which was before the freshman seminars, and I primarily identify as a folklorist. I’m always following folklore and I tried to think of something that could appeal to students —  that they would have some sort of familiarity with but could bring in international perspectives and historical perspectives as well as sort of contemporary American perspectives, and I just thought: You know what — ghost stories. You know, so many different cultures around the world have ghost stories. It was just sort of a good way to organize something that would be a good point of conversation for a lot of students, to get the conversation flowing. 
When you start talking about ghost stories, you start talking about ideas about the soul, about different religions, about different cultures across the world. But you don’t have to go in saying, “OK, we’re going to talk about religion and ideas of the souls.” So, I think it’s an easier way to start the conversation of some really compelling matters without starting right at the hot points.
DT: How is the class structured?
TT: We start off with a little bit of a historical glance, looking at a few ancient civilizations like ancient Egypt or ancient Greece and showing how their beliefs of ghosts work. Then we move to the contemporary and look at Native American ghosts, which are very fascinating. We go on to sort of East Asian cultures where ghosts are huge. We look at, “What are we haunted by?” We’re haunted by ethical failures, by moral failures, so when looking at ghost stories of different societies you’ll see: What are different societies haunted by?
America’s most common ghost stories are those of Native American burial grounds — real common — ghosts of African American slaves … so that tells you something about American history right there. That we are still haunted by those ethical failures in the past, that somehow these haven’t been resolved. On the other hand, the most common experience of ghosts in America is seeing or having a visitation by a dead loved one. 
Whether or not you want to believe in ghosts, I leave that up to you. But psychologically, of course, that tends to be a soothing quality to us: That idea that you haven’t quite lost them plays a real important human role in the process of losing people.
DT: What do you hope students take away from the course?
TT: I’m an anthropologist, so I hope that they come away from the course with an understanding of how different cultures think about things differently and think about very important things, like life after death, the divine qualities of the universe, what it is to be a person, what it is to have a soul, what it is to be moral or ethical — and understand the ways that different societies are all trying to work with these very compelling issues and some of the various ways societies have tried to provide answers for those.
DT: What do you believe the significance of ghost stories, and folklore in general, is in our culture?
TT: Huge! One word is huge. I’m a folklorist, and so obviously, I think it’s important. Going back to my idea that most Americans believe in ghosts, it’s clear they don’t derive this belief from science, and it’s clear that they don’t derive this belief — at least directly — from religious authorities, so what it seems to indicate is that the beliefs are derived from folklore. So there’s a tremendous amount of ways we build knowledge socially and communally. 
Our everyday artistic activity, whether it’s just a joke we tell at a party or a traditional toast you do at your sibling’s wedding, I think there’s a tremendous amount of personal meaning that people derive from folklore, and for me that’s what makes it special.
DT: Do you have any particular favorite ghost stories? 
TT: I’ll give you this one — it’s a story that I’m going to set at USC because it’s folklore and we can update it. So, these two guys are hometown buddies and both going to go to USC. So they’re driving together to go attend college and the dorms aren’t quite open yet, so they’re going to stay in a hotel for a couple of days. Now, one of them is a little wealthier than the other, comes from a better off family, so the poorer kid basically stays in kind of a sleazebag motel and his friend feels kind of bad, but the hotel he arranges is much nicer. He drops his friend off and worries because it doesn’t feel right. 
He goes to sleep and he has this dream where his friend is all bloody and saying, “help me, help me,” and he wakes up and freaks out and tries to call his buddy on the phone but — no answer. Tries to text him — no answer. Finally he drives over to the motel in the middle of the night, wakes up the manager, goes to the room and his buddy is not in the room. He’s freaking out and trying to figure out what to do. The next day comes along — no word, no nothing — calls the cops and tells them about the dream and they do the whole search and they finally find his friend’s dead body mutilated all bloody in the dumpster in the back.
I just updated that — that’s actually in Roman literature, the same ghost story, so I’ve heard it in a contemporary setting but you can also find it in Roman literature. OK, without the cell phone, but everything else is basically the same. A lot of these stories have sort of been recycled throughout our culture for hundreds of years sometimes.
DT: Ghosts also play a large role in Halloween and celebrating Halloween, so what do you think about the relationship between the two?
TT: Our modern Halloween is derived from the Celtic world… Interestingly enough, in the Celtic realm, this was the beginning of the new year. The ancient Celts divided the year between a dark half and a light half, so this was the beginning of the dark half and the beginning of the light half was in May. In ancient Celtic traditions, the dead would be hosted by the she spirits as in the banshee, which you may have heard of, and they would be hosted by this — this was sort of the other world of the dead. It overlaps with our world but in an invisible sense, but there’s a couple of nodes, you might say. There’s a temporal and a spatial node. 
The temporal nodes are exactly that, Halloween and May Day, and temporal nodes in Celtic tradition would’ve been these great megalithic sites. But basically, the idea is that these are the times when the lines between these two worlds are the thinnest, so the dead could walk amongst the living, and the living likewise are walking in the world of the dead. So all of our sort of Halloween traditions derive from these sorts of festivals, which is why you see the dead so much. So, as for how this came to American culture, it was pretty much with the big Irish immigration after the big Irish potato famine. Before that, they didn’t really have Halloween in America.
DT: Is there anything else you’d like to share?
TT: So, a personal research interest that I’ve been doing on my own that I think is kind of fascinating is — I make students collect ghost stories as part of the class, and one thing I’ve noticed over the years is that there are more and more ghost stories with technology. Cell phone texts from the beyond, haunted servers, these sort of things are becoming more and more a part of what we see, which is fascinating. 
We’re moving into this cyborg realm where our very souls are being located within the internet and the cyber discourse. So, this idea of cyborg ghosts is continuing to be a growing development, so I’ve been looking a lot at that. I’ve also been looking at this idea of androids, and as a sort of prognostication I anticipate that as androids have become more and more a part of our environment, which they already are in Japan, what happens when they die? Will they become a beloved part of your social network or are we going to have android ghosts? And I think the answer is probably yes, we will be haunted by androids. Especially if we don’t deal with that situation in an ethical manner.

Genre has always been a pivotal tool used to separate what type of film an audience wants to see. People looking for a laugh might see a comedy, while those who want to explore their emotions might see a drama. It’s only the adrenaline junkies who would ever see a horror film.
From slashers to psychological thrillers, the horror genre has expanded its boundaries and pushed its own limits. Like any fashion trend, horror films have endured fluctuations in popularity over the years.
Films like The Wolfman or Night of the Living Dead first featured supernatural elements meant to terrify audiences. The monster-centric horror films reached a point of fatigue and were replaced by more realistically approached films like Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. These latter films emphasized the horrors that humans can instill in people. Both of these films are hailed as some of the strongest, and the most creative forms of social commentary.
Whether they aim to depict real life or a heightened reality, horror flicks have always been filled with metaphors applicable to the most simple elements of life — whether addressing grief in The Babadook or exposing the subtle and systemic racism plaguing America in Get Out. Thus, horror movies continue to be some of the most intriguing works.
The current renaissance of the horror film rages on. While there will always be cheaply made, seemingly haphazardly thrown together projects like the more recent entries in the Paranormal Activity franchise, there have been several subversive and surprisingly phenomenal horror films as well. 
The best examples come from this year alone. Both Get Out and M. Night Shyamalan’s Split surprised audiences and overperformed at the box office. More recently, the latest iteration of Stephen King’s It broke box office records for both R-rated and horror films. 
Horror’s surge in popularity is largely due to its capacity for creative freedom. As long as the metaphors and the underlying messages of the film are buried beneath the lens of supernatural or human-based chaos and carnage, filmmakers can exercise their points of view in a truly captivating way. 
People see horror films for different reasons, and they always will. Some enjoy the adrenaline rush from being scared, while others find the metaphors presented exciting and thought-provoking. As long as films continue to be made, a diverse array of horror films will continue to be developed.

Cultural appropriation has been stitched into the fabric of Halloween and into the great American quilt. We cannot avoid it; there is no restitching; there is no unseaming. For now, we live with it, while wondering: How is it that we are so socially aware, yet so tone-deaf when it comes to the cultures of other people?
It’s understood that people will always find the cultures of other people fascinating. But too often Halloween revelers will dance between the lines of appropriation and appreciation, rarely with any consequence or thoughtful reflection. It’s tiring to have to constantly remind people that people are not costumes, and that the appropriation of other cultures is offensive. 
Cultural appropriation occurs when the elements of one culture are taken by members of another culture, and then exploited for monetary gain, or simple fun. Halloween is often the peak of this phenomenon. The holiday comprises two different types of exploiters — those who sell the elements of other cultures as costumes, and those who buy them. 
But this year, the tolerance for cultural appropriation is at an all-time low. As racial tension continues to increase, while the president is continuously threatening to deport millions of people, many will not forget those who voted for and against their existence within this country. People will remember those who spoke out for and against the strenuous factors such as racism and discrimination, which impact their day-to-day lives. These are factors whose existence often make no difference to those who decide to appropriate the cultures of other people. So the hypocrisy will sting a little bit more this year. 
If you support a border wall between the United States and Mexico and deportation of millions of immigrants in this country, should you be wearing any sort of costume from Mexican, Middle Eastern or South Asian cultures? If you do not think black people are targeted and treated unfairly in this country, should you be dressing up as your favorite black rapper? Can you enjoy one without paying attention to the other? The answer is unclear.
The title of an article published by The New York Times in 2015 perfectly sums up one side of the debate on cultural appropriation — “Halloween Costume Correctness on Campus: Feel Free to be You, but Not Me.” People are not costumes, and it is disrespectful to treat them as such. People who pretend to be from a marginalized culture, or a figure from a marginalized group, will offend others. If you don’t hail from a certain culture, you cannot say whether the culture can or cannot be appropriated, or decide if it is offensive or not. Offensive stereotypes in general should always be off-limits. There is no joke in the stereotypes that have cost people their lives.
“I feel it’s frustrating to see minorities constantly being mistreated in our country but then people think it’s okay to pick and choose parts of our cultures to be cool and trendy,” said Patricia Quezada, a junior majoring in business administration. “And it’s annoying when people use parts of cultures that are sacred like religious things just for looks and they disrespect the culture they’re copying.”
People have the right to express themselves freely, whether it is offensive or not to other people. But, when they partake in exercising free speech through cultural appropriation, it has the real consequence of hurting others. It’s about those who have the privilege to partake in this right — those who can take off the costume at the end of the day, and those who cannot.
“I feel like if people are respecting my culture and addressing my culture when dressing up like Día de los Muertos, then it’s okay for me personally, because so many people do it now that I don’t think it’ll stop. It’s become a trend,” Quezada said. “But when people who do not respect the Latino communitydo it, it’s a problem.”
There are ways to appreciate the cultures of other people without being grotesque — because it is the grotesque nature of appropriating Halloween costumes that makes most of them offensive. For example, if you do decide to be Kanye West for Halloween, there is never the need for blackface. Ever. Why wear a stereotypical, over-sexualized costume from the culture of a marginalized group, when you can dress up like a blue Skittle instead? You would have just as much fun.
So, this Halloween, if you think what you are wearing will offend people, take it off. If you truly wish to dress up as someone from another culture, the best way is to research the correct way to be whatever it is you want to be. Don’t be something you can’t explain, or don’t understand. The tricky part is dancing between the lines of what is considered appropriation and appreciation. Know the limits. There is no clear line, but being too safe will not hurt you.

Tyler, The Creator’s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival celebrated its sixth year on Oct. 28 and 29. Photo by Dillon Matthew | Daily Trojan
Artists such as Lana Del Rey, Solange, Kid Cudi, A$AP Rocky and Tyler, The Creator performed to sold-out crowds in Exposition Park this weekend for the sixth annual Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival.
Exposition Park is no stranger to Los Angeles festival-goers. FYF Fest inhabits the grounds during the summer months for three days to sold-out crowds and enthusiastic fans. And with Camp Flog Gnaw’s ever-growing popularity, Exposition Park may be giving the Empire Polo Club, which hosts the Stagecoach and Coachella Valley Music and Arts festivals (respectively), a run for its money. Those who attended FYF Fest surely got a taste of déjà vu upon entering the festival grounds. The setup, from the entrance line to the food vendors, was essentially identical. The entrance queue moved at a brisk pace, and not many had to wait too long to settle into the festival. However, people shouldn’t let the general similarities lull them into thinking that both festivals are the same. The greatest difference between FYF and CFG was the presence of carnival rides. In addition to the multiple Ferris wheels across the park, there were six other rides festival-goers could occupy while waiting for their favorite artists, including a giant swinging ship and a zero-gravity spinner.
The other greatest difference was the weather. Many substituted crop tops and bandeaus for sweaters and bombers. Furthermore, nostalgia was the primary theme at Camp Flog Gnaw. Many were dressed in classic ’80s and ’90s garb, such as neon windbreakers, fanny packs, Tretorns and New Balances. It was also no surprise to see many dressed in Halloween costumes, given that many had to sacrifice their weekend party plans to attend the festival. Overall, there was a playfulness, akin to childlike amusement, to Camp Flog Gnaw noticeably missing at other festivals.
But of course, the reason people showed up and endured the crowds was for the music. Highlights from Day 1 included Mac Miller, Kelela and Tyler, The Creator. The biggest jaw-dropper, however, came from Mac Demarco, who was billed as  a “Special Guest” during the 6:15-6:45 p.m. timeslot. Though there was chatter that the guest would be Frank Ocean, the indie rocker still received an enthusiastic response as he performed songs like “Passing Out Pieces” and “One More Love Song.”
Tyler, The Creator also delivered a memorable set, as many Saturday guests seemed most ecstatic to see the festival’s mastermind. His set seemed easily the most packed, as he performed songs such as “Where This Flower Blooms” from his latest album, Flower Boy.
Closing out the first day was singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. On the heels of her latest album release, Lust For Life, she began her set with “13 Beaches,” but didn’t shy away from her classics, such as “Video Games” and “Born to Die.” Clad in a classic little black dress and matching choker, Del Rey’s aesthetic has evolved over the years, yet she remains true to her sad-girl Americana persona. The crowd emptied a bit at the Camp Stage following Tyler, the Creator’s performance, leaving Del Rey’s superfans to engage in a more intimate experience with the New York-born chanteuse.
Day 2 began a bit more slowly than the first, though there was no shortage of stamina from many festival-goers. The weather was considerably less sunny than the day before, and Angelenos got their first real taste of autumnal cloudiness for the season. The crowds seemed to arrive in masses as the day went on, waiting for artists such as A$AP Rocky, Solange, 2 Chainz and Kid Cudi.
During his set, A$AP Rocky brought out Tyler, The Creator and Playboi Carti (who also performed Sunday) for “Telephone Calls,” which received an obvious ovation from the crowd. Solange delivered the most well-executed and meticulous performance of the festival. The Houston-born artist has been making rounds in both solo and festival gigs. 
In fact, she’s already performed twice in Los Angeles in the last three months: once at FYF and again at the Hollywood Bowl (alongside Blood Orange and Kelela). Her highly-acclaimed album A Seat at the Table has also been well-received by the public, evident by the crowd’s reactions as she began her set with “Rise.” 
Closing out the festival was Kid Cudi, who just last month began a new tour after releasing Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin’ last year. Sunday’s attendees chose to attend the late-night set (which began at 11:15 p.m. and ended well after midnight) to experience what could be the most exciting and enthralling performance of the entire festival. Cudi began with “Baptized in Fire” to deafening screams from fans, and transitioned to other songs from previous albums like “REVOFEV” from Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. He became emotional later in the evening as he addressed the crowd and thanked them for their support over the years.
“This sh-t has been overwhelming since I’ve stepped on this stage, [but] you’ve been there with me this whole time, and I love you for that,” Cudi said to the audience. “Thank you so much.” 
As Camp Flog Gnaw continues its progressive climb on the concert radar, those who frequent the festival scene should keep an eye out for next year’s carnival.

On Oct. 28 and 29, Los Angeles hosted the food and drink festival Taste Talks in one of four national annual conferences. Photo by Gabrielle Robinson | Daily Trojan
“Are you coming to the cereal party we’re hosting with Roy Choi?” Nguyen Tran of Button Mash asked Pawan Mahendro of Badmaash at Taste Talks on Sunday.
These were the types of conversations occurring among the celebrity chefs and restaurant owners of Los Angeles at Taste Talks. Taste Talks holds four national conferences annually in Brooklyn, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles — the latest of which took place this past weekend. Taste Talks Los Angeles was a packed event that included a conference and cookout, bringing together influential chefs, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs and other food industry professionals for tastings, outdoor cookouts and panels. 
Some celebrity chefs cooking and participating in panel discussions included Australian celebrity chef Curtis Stone, Christian Page of Cassell’s and Josh Elkin of the Cooking Channel. The food festival was a celebration of culinary innovation in the global city of Los Angeles, as exemplified in talks by chefs like Pawan Mahendro.
Born and raised in Punjab, India, Mahendro is the owner and executive chef of Badmaash, an Indian gastropub located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles serving Indian dishes, burgers and beers with Bollywood movies projected onto its walls. His sons, Nakul and Arjun Mahendro, are also co-owners of the restaurant.
“Bollywood, Biggie and butter chicken,” Nakul said on why USC students should try Badmaash. 
Pawan Mahendro attributes Badmaash’s success to customers leaving satisfied and happy with their dining experience, which extends beyond the dishes themselves. At Badmaash, the high ceilings, marble-topped counters and hip Indian decor contribute to this experiential satisfaction. 
On his top three favorite restaurants in Los Angeles, Pawan recommends  getting reservations at Bestia and Otium — both located in downtown Los Angeles. Their story and culture was one of many represented at Taste Talks 2017.
Aside from the talks, there was an outdoor grilling event featuring owners of Los Angeles’ hottest restaurants. The Exchange in downtown Los Angeles, by Alex Chang, serves Israeli food with a Californian influence. The dish it served was intriguing enough to compel tasters to visit the restaurant. Chang emphasized that the restaurant is inspired by worldwide hotels and echoes USC’s global community.

I love Halloween. It’s hands-down my favorite holiday. For the last few years, I’ve gotten into the habit of getting into the spooky spirit well in advance. Like, two months ahead. I do this because I feel like Halloween always comes and goes so quickly, before I can truly appreciate the holiday. Like those who wait for Christmas year-round, I anxiously anticipate Halloween’s arrival with an open heart and stomach, ready for junk food and other crap I reserve only for October months.
However, for someone who loves Halloween as much as I do, it’s surprising how little effort I’ve put into my costumes. Every year it’s the same song and dance: I always say I’m going to go all out for a costume, that I’ll actually put in the time and energy to blow everyone away with a phenomenally original ensemble. Yes, this year is going to be different, I told myself as I do every year.
And again, like the year before, that didn’t happen. And I’m now forced to come up with something half-assed that I put together the night before.
It doesn’t help that it took me and my boyfriend weeks to figure out what we wanted to go as. Last year, we both dressed up individually, with no connection between our garbs. That’s why I was so adamant that we’d have a shared costume that was perfectly paired. But in deciding what our costume should be, I remembered why we didn’t coordinate last year: We have different taste in just about everything — music, movies, style, among many other things. So everything I suggested (which was mostly costumes based on my favorite operas), he vetoed. And vice versa. Eventually, after weeks of back-and-forth banter, we made the executive decision: We’re going as Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. 
We made the decision Saturday. That gave us two days to plan and purchase our costumes.
We dedicated Sunday morning to costume shopping. As a big Nirvana and Hole fan, and by proxy an even bigger Kurt and Courtney fan, I knew this was something that wouldn’t require much work, but would still satisfy my need to not compromise my taste. I knew exactly what would work and what wouldn’t. And I, for one, already wear similar clothing to what Cobain wore in his prime: oversized t-shirts, fitted jeans, distressed sneakers, tattered hair. All I needed was a pair of big red sunglasses and a blond wig. How hard could that be?
Apparently, very. As Matthew and I wandered down Hollywood Boulevard, amid the plethora of pop-up Halloween stores and wig shops, my goal was to find the perfect Kurt Cobain wig. The sunglasses were a luxury item, something I’d be shocked to find in any store I wandered into. But the wig was a necessity. And I found it! At Hollywood Wigs on Hollywood Boulevard. I asked for the price and was told it was $80.
Never mind.
We kept looking. Eventually, I could feel what felt like hours of searching wearing down my body. But then I checked my watch and realized we’d only been looking for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, Matthew had already found the items to perfect his ensemble. I, however, still trudged my feet as if walking through molasses to find any semblance of Kurt Cobain. But in trying to find a piece for my costume, I realized that the reason finding a costume is so hard for me is that I don’t like dressing up. And maybe that’s why I could never make it as a performer: I didn’t like changing who I was. 
I’m content with who I am, and dressing up like someone else makes me feel as if I’m trying too hard, or as if I’m covering up my imperfections. And for that matter, Cobain would probably hate the fact that people were dressing up as him for this holiday. In fact, I’m probably doing a disservice to his heritage by paying homage to him in such a droll manner. So I decided the less work I put into it, the more I’d preserve his legacy.
I’ll just keep telling myself that.
In the end, I bought a mop head which I plan to drape over my hair. It makes me look like Raggedy Andy, but somehow I think it’s the most fitting and accurate portrayal of Cobain. In turn, I applaud Matthew for going as Courtney Love. It wasn’t a hard decision to decide who was going as whom; it was pretty much decided that I would go as Cobain and he as Love. When Matthew picked out the black mini dress, disheveled blonde wig and red lipstick that Love made her signature, I knew there’d be no way I could upstage him, which seems representative  of Cobain and Love’s relationship in general. 
Even though some may question whether or not I put any effort into my costume, I feel content in my decision to downplay the importance of dressing up. I don’t think it’s a middle finger to others who put time and effort into the perfect getup — but it isn’t a thumbs up either. Maybe this will be the beginning of my new Halloween tradition: not giving a f-ck.

Most eighth graders might blush and laugh uncertainly when they hear their classmates read the N-Word aloud in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. In 2004, Garvey Jackson, a 13-year-old attending school in Hillsborough, N.C., was not as amused as his peers. After studying Lee’s novel in English class, Jackson went to school dressed in a shirt covered with the book’s many racial slurs, claiming that if the N-word is “good enough for the book, it’s good enough for the shirt.” 
Earlier this month, the Biloxi Public School District in Mississippi echoed that sentiment when it removed To Kill a Mockingbird from its curriculum based on debates over the novel’s “uncomfortable” language — perhaps the same language that appeared on Jackson’s shirt. 
Universities — centers for the advancement of modern academia — should not be afraid of the truth, but they, too, are not immune to the occasional act of book-banning. For instance, in 2008, officials at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis accused student janitor Keith John Sampson of racial harassment for reading a book about the Ku Klux Klan. Although Sampson obtained the book from the university’s library, officials still reprimanded him, comparing the instance to “bringing pornography to work.” After multiple complaints from the the American Civil Liberties Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the university’s chancellor officially apologized to Sampson, emphasizing the school’s belief in free expression. 
The issue of censorship on college campuses was again brought to debate last year, when the University of Wisconsin-Stout removed murals depicting Native Americans and French fur traders from its walls. Although the paintings in question did not overtly depict any oppression of Native Americans, the university’s chancellor advocated that the murals be taken down because the art “symbolizes an era of their history where land and possessions were taken away from [Native Americans], and [students] feel bad when they look at them.” The chancellor believed that removing the potentially offensive paintings would “attract more Native American students to the university.” 
In both cases, the universities sacrificed their core values based on weak attempts to uphold the image of political correctness; banning a book or taking down a mural does nothing to end the marginalization of minorities. On the contrary, these actions can worsen the problem, as we cannot confront our issues if we do not fully understand what they are. As models for higher learning, universities must stand firm in their commitment to giving their students a complete and honest education — and fully exposing them to the truth is an important part of that. 
But criticizing a school’s limitations on free expression by no means offers a blank check for people to freely wave the Confederate flag and glorify racist ideologies as a celebration of their “history.” Classroom settings provide students with a crucial platform to engage in open discussion with their peers and learn from their viewpoints without feeling threatened. Exposure to a safe environment is critical to forming both an emotional and logical understanding of pressing social issues, and it can encourage students to make informed decisions when they approach these problems in the future.
The aforementioned school policies not only inhibit progress, but also undermine the principles of political correctness that they claim to uphold in the first place. The basic purpose of being politically correct is to exercise tolerance, as we cannot move forward as a society if we alienate minority populations along the way. But these schools seem to have taken this notion and run away with it. It is one thing to ask people to stop using the N-word; it is another to prevent them from ever seeing it. Discomfort with the realities of minorities’ experiences should not be a hindrance to intellectual development.
While the complaints of a few public schools in Mississippi may seem inconsequential, their arguments are just some of many that demand controversial books be banned from the school system. In fact, a Washington Post report on the topic states that last year, more than 300 formal complaints were issued against popular literary works such as the Harry Potter series, Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. 
If anything, that Lee’s book, which was published 57 years ago, remains a source of heated debate only proves the enduring need for it to remain in school curriculum. The groundbreaking novel has long been a critical resource for younger students, encouraging a sense of open-mindedness through its insightful portrayal of racism, social class and gender roles — serious themes that need serious words to communicate them. The education system must realize that censorship cannot be justified by discomfort. We cannot deal with major issues by pretending they do not exist. 
In its entirety, the advocacy for educational censorship represents regressive attitudes that continue to plague schools today — and considering the divisive state of the current political climate, that argument does not seem to be leaving anytime soon. For now, perhaps school officials can benefit from taking a closer look at the books they decide to ban. 
I agree that “advocacy for educational censorship represents regressive attitudes that continue to plague schools today.” This is a problem, but it’s also far too easy to overblow individual cases and also the problem as a whole. People are looking to read things that make them feel anger among other emotions, so its easy money. But let’s resist that and be clear about each case. Call a spade a spade. For example, the painting above was historically inaccurate in the direction of common misconceptions and merely moved from a hallway display to a gallery display that is much less frequented. The move can be criticized as not being the best choice. Perhaps students would prefer to stop in the middle of the hallway to read a detailed description about the history involved in the painting versus the reality it did not represent. That could probably be done well enough. But as it really was, in the hallway, it was not benefiting anyone’s education. And it was neither true nor provoking confrontation with the truth in any meaningful sense. And if the average lesson learned is untrue, if anything, then why should it be defended in that context? Only those who already knew the lesson could perceive it at all. 
Full exposure to the truth is extremely important. And the characterization of that decision in the above article does not do that. In order to really push the value of truth in the face of discomfort or disagreement or other challenges, we need to be clear about what’s what. Lumping together serious mistakes and trivial, arguable ones is counterproductive, especially when it requires a misleading narrative. Point is, we shouldn’t be stretching the truth to fit, especially when the point is to promote truth.
How will people cope with the realities of the world when all the things that make them uneasy are removed? Struggle is a part of life as are confrontational ideals and differing opinions. Shouting down those with whom we disagree rather than engage and discuss teaches us nothing – least of all, tolerance.
Steve, you don’t get the principle behind banning literature, art or music that protected groups might find distasteful. Likewise, these protected groups must have “safe spaces.” In the safe spaces, even the most sympathetic and friendly, of non-protected persons must be barred from entry. The reason for that is, that the protected groups may find non-protected people distasteful, because of the concept that they are somehow priveleged.
Discussion, understanding, empathy and tolerance, between protected and non-protected like you advocate, are to be shunned and eliminated. Why? Because a thought or word or mention of historical or present injustice might be found offensive by the protected class. And they must be protected at all cost.
Don, where would the civil rights movement be if your way of thinking was adopted by Dr. King? Where do you get such arrogance as to think you and people of like mind can dictate to the people you define as protected? Why would you assume that you have that power over them? Did it ever occur to you that they are capable of running their own lives? How will these “protected” people EVER be able to work with all the potential distasteful things they may run into in the course of a day? Are they to be exempted from earning a living and providing for their families? Its a ridiculous concept. 
Don, you and people like you are trying to turn minorities into a protected class of people you can control and dictate policy of how to run their lives and steal their power. They don’t need you. They are capable of controlling their own lives and accomplishing great things. What you are doing is advocating racism and separatism in a new form. Don, Hitler banned music, books, and paintings he decided distasteful. In America we have freedom that is guaranteed by the Constitution. Freedom to write a book, compose a song, and paint a painting. The Constitution makes us all equal and provides the same opportunity. Your protected class doesn’t adhere to the definition of equality. It sets one group above others and creates tyranny. A tyranny in which YOU and others like you seek to control. Let me be the first to say we don’t need you.
I understand your anger, but I think you might be putting it on the wrong person. 
Personally, I don’t think Steve necessarily supports the actions he was describing.
I think that he’s trying to describe their logic, as boneheaded as it might be.
You have no idea what I am thinking. If you did, you would not make the mistake of thinking I am angry. I am incredulous to the idea that people in academia can have such racist tendencies and not see it. It appears they feel they are doing something noble, when in fact they are minimizing the abilities of this “protected group” thinking they must raise them up like a god or royalty. I was waiting for Don to say he washed one of the persons feet with his hair. In fact they are co-opting their status as minority to give themselves a righteous platform in which to speak and thereby elevate themselves. It is not a selfless act they seek, but self enrichment and accolades from the like-minded that they are somehow advancing culture rather than oppressing those they claim to help and defend. You wanted to know what I think? Well, there it is. 
All most people want is to be treated fairly and have an equal opportunity at what they define as the American dream. A home, a business, to raise their children in a good neighborhood, etc. Unfortunately, it all gets convoluted by bullshit like the stuff Don is shoveling.

In the past week, two cases regarding the health of undocumented children have struck the national news cycle — alarming lawmakers and citizens alike with the idea that proper health care for minors within American borders is an arena for debate at all. In the most recent case, 10-year-old Rosa Maria Hernandez was en route to the hospital for gall bladder surgery when her ambulance began to be trailed by border patrol agents, who ultimately detained Hernandez post-surgery.
In an almost parallel timeframe, an unidentified 17-year-old girl (“Jane Doe”) from Central America was the subject of a fierce legal debate after requesting an opportunity to receive an off-site abortion from the facility where she was detained; she had crossed the border unchaperoned by any guardian. With the American Civil Liberties Union on her side, however, Jane Doe was eventually able to have the procedure.
And yet, in both these cases, the fact stands: The Trump administration’s tight grip on the medical futures of these children is disturbing and unnecessary. Especially juxtaposed against the shadow of those test border-wall sections constructed with a gross, almost home-decor-esque display of nationalist fervor, Hernandez and Doe are the real faces of real people impacted by the real juggernaut of xenophobia leaked into law-making and law-deciding. It is becoming evident that when it comes to limiting illegal immigration, the government operates in a way that not only holds absolute disregard for the irreparable harm it may cause the minors whom it targets but also exploits, in the cruelest of ways, the idea that deporting undocumented immigrants will keep Americans safe and protected — apparently, in these circumstances, from children in need of medical care.
Indeed, such a method of thinking — that one’s citizenship status supersedes one’s right to care and safety — is a mentality that propels itself beyond the avenue of undocumented immigrants’ lives. Inordinately cruel, the sentiment that abortion is an excessive medical expense and that the well-being of children is second to national identity are ones that hold implications for and should disturb everyone living within the United States — citizen or not.
In his NPR article, reporter Bill Chappell quotes anti-abortion Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins, who referenced Jane Doe’s case, saying, “we hope that [the] Trump administration will continue to fight to protect the lives of all on U.S. soil.” There is too much irony to parse through here, though perhaps the most obvious contradiction to be pointed out is that the idea of protection, discussed over and over in regard to illegal immigration, seems — in Hawkins’ eyes, at least — to apply to everyone in this case but Doe herself. The mindset spoken by Hawkins and those with similar beliefs perpetuates an immense encroachment on human rights and access to basic health care for undocumented children and adults, not to mention the numerous adverse effects on their mental and physical health as a result.
In the case of Jane Doe, it is clearly a double issue between the human rights of the United States’ undocumented population and the issue of abortion itself. The Trump administration wants to make strides in dismantling abortion, and of course it would initially target someone it deems defenseless and voiceless (though, as the news cycle has demonstrated, Jane Doe has not stepped back from her own fight). And still, the uneasy battle surrounding Jane Doe’s efforts to live a life with freedom to choose what happens to her own body ultimately reflects back on the ongoing fight for the rights of undocumented women and girls — and also the right of all women to govern their own bodies. It is about the administration attacking the idea of abortion itself, and picking its fight where it feels the strongest — against a child whose voice, it figures, cannot rise high enough to protest. And yet, as is demonstrated with the aid of the ACLU, Jane’s voice did. 
In this day and age, it is easy for political decisions to blend one into another, for the announcement of yet another piece of oppressive legislation to go over one’s head — especially when one doesn’t find oneself directly mired in the impacts of these new national movements. And yet, the mistreatment of undocumented children is an undeniable national shame, and such efforts by the administration to curb their rights cannot pass by without this acknowledgement: Limiting the human rights of many starts with limiting the human rights of a few.

The women’s volleyball team returned from Washington with a 1-1 record over the weekend, narrowly losing in a five-set thriller against No. 14 Washington on Friday before sweeping Washington State on Sunday. The Trojans move to 16-7 on the season with the weekend split. 
Against the Huskies, the Women of Troy kept close in the first frame, but Washington used a 7-2 run to distance itself from the Trojans to take the opening set 25-19. The Trojans surged past the Huskies to take second set 25-16 and scored on critical possessions to stop their opponent’s momentum. In the crucial third set, USC opened strong but found itself in a tight battle, holding a 21-20 edge. Senior opposite hitter Niki Withers scored on two crucial possessions toward the end of the set to lift USC to a 25-22 win and a 2-1 overall lead.
The fourth set was a seesaw battle with no team gaining real control, going into a tiebreaker and continuing until both teams were tied at 30. A kill by Tia Scambray and a USC service error brought an end to the marathon set, and Washington tied the match at 2-2. In the final set of the grueling battle, the Women of Troy jumped out to an early 6-3 lead, but a 7-0 Washington run tilted the momentum in Washington’s favor. The Huskies never looked back, and they took the fifth set 15-12 to send USC away with its third loss in the last four matches. 
In the absence of sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, freshman opposite hitter Brooke Botkin stepped up to lead the Women of Troy with 20 kills in Seattle. Senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie also chipped in with 19 kills. Both of USC’s setters, senior Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore Cindy Marina, tallied 30-plus assists each. 
Despite the loss, the Women of Troy bounced back to sweep Washington State 3-0 on Sunday. In a tight first set that saw 14 different deadlocks, the Cougars and Trojans battled to a 23-23 stalemate. However, junior outside hitter Alyse Ford scored a crucial kill to put the Women of Troy ahead 24-23, before a service error by the Cougars handed the Trojans the opening frame.
The Women of Troy cruised from there. They fought to a narrow 17-16 lead in the second set but went on an 8-0 run to take a two-set lead. The Trojans then jumped out to a 11-4 lead in the third set and never looked back, limiting the Cougars to just 13 points en route to a 25-13 win, closing the match on a 6-0 run.
 Ford led USC with 14 kills in the short three-set sweep, and freshman opposite hitter Brooke Botkins tallied 10 kills. Abercrombie and Withers chipped in with a combined 17 kills, while senior middle blocker Jordan Dunn scored five kills and led the USC defense with eight block assists. Meyer-Whalley and Marina combined for 35 assists in the winning effort. 
With the split, the Women of Troy moved up to No. 17 in this week’s AVCA Coaches poll. The Women of Troy return home to the Galen Center this weekend, as they face Arizona State at 7 p.m. on Friday and Arizona at 11 a.m. on Sunday.

The fifth-ranked women’s soccer team hosted No. 1 Stanford on Sunday at McAlister Field, falling 3-1 after beating the Cardinal 3-0 in the same fixture last season.
The match was set to be a thriller on USC’s Senior Night, with two undefeated Pac-12 teams battling late into the season. Stanford entered the game with a 9-0-0 conference record compared to the Trojans’ 8-0-1 mark.
But Stanford quieted the crowd in the 15th minute, drawing first blood. Cardinal midfielder Jaye Boissiere landed a cross from the top corner of the 18-yard box onto the head of Kiki Pickett. Just outside the 18-yard box, Pickett redirected the ball toward the bottom-right corner of the Trojan goal — just out of the reach of redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins — to grant the Cardinal an early 1-0 lead.
USC quickly responded just two minutes later. With her back to the net, redshirt junior midfielder Sydney Myers received a pass from sophomore defender Julia Bigham. Myers found the equalizer with a quick turn inside the penalty box and a low shot rifled through traffic to the near post. The goal marked Myers’ second of the season — her first came a month ago in a 4-0 win over Oregon State.
In the 26th minute, going toe-to-toe with freshman forward Tara McKeown, Cardinal junior midfielder Michelle Xiao beat McKeown on the outside and delivered an arcing ball just underneath the Trojans’ crossbar to once again take the lead. The remainder of the first half was scoreless thanks to a fantastic flying save from Collins on a header from freshman forward Civanna Kuhlmann. 
With some words of wisdom from head coach Keidane McAlpine, USC was able to regroup and come out flying in the second half. McAlpine said the main focus of his team talk was being aggressive.
“We wanted to apply more pressure to their backline, and that was probably the biggest change in the second half,” McAlpine said. “It created enough chances. We just didn’t take them.”
The aggressive mentality and playstyle produced several scoring opportunities for the Women of Troy — none of which were converted into goals. But the Trojan backline played lockdown defense throughout the second half and were able to keep their team in the game. Collins faced 18 shots in the match — her highest tally this season — and saved seven. 
But after making comebacks a habit throughout this fall, the Women of Troy did not respond on Sunday, and Stanford netted its second unanswered goal.
Despite the strong defensive performance, the Cardinal sealed the game in the 63rd minute with its third goal on the day, when Catarina Macario sent a bending free kick into the top-right corner beyond a sprawling Collins. Sunday marked the first game since Aug. 19, 2016 — last year’s season-opener against Santa Clara — that USC has conceded 3 goals in one game. 
The loss to the Cardinal was the Trojans’ first against a Pac-12 team in 2017, and their conference record fell to 8-1-1. The Women of Troy will now prepare for their final game of the regular season on Friday, when they face off against crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA. 
“We have to play a full 90-minute game,” redshirt junior Sydney Myers said. “We have to match the aggression and give our 100-percent effort the whole game. I think we are going to be just as good as we were last year.”
The Trojans fell 1-0 to the Bruins at the StubHub Center last season, and they look to avoid a repeat this Friday in Westwood against a dominant UCLA team.

Angel Viscarra | Daily Trojan
Award-winning sports columnist Rick Reilly often reflects and speaks on an experience of his in which the stage was just “too big.” Whenever Reilly reminisces about the 1986 Masters, when Jack Nicklaus won his sixth green jacket, he mentions a media member who held his head and uttered, “It’s too big. I can’t write it,” as Nicklaus won his 18th and final major championship. Media members that day in Augusta, Ga., including Reilly himself, admit they had no clue how they were going to encapsulate the historical significance of what had just occurred in front of them — while hitting deadline for their stories. 
I have a similar feeling I type out this column. To write a column on the brilliance of this year’s World Series between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers is intimidating. Through the first five episodes of the 2017 Fall Classic, millions of spectators worldwide have been captivated and honed in on every pitch thrown, ball hit and ball fielded. 
Entering this series, we all knew these two teams each had the makeup and track record to make this an iconic Fall Classic. Rarely in sports does a great series on paper translate to a great series on the field of play. 
All the elements have been there. This series includes Cy Young winners, league MVPs, batting title champions, All-Stars and more on both sides. For the first time since 1970, this series includes two teams that boasted 100-plus wins in the regular season.
This World Series has been the epitome of a heavyweight title bout between the two undisputedly best teams in baseball. This is Ali-Frazier. Through five games, both sides have thrown — and connected on — several devastating haymakers. 
The most recent installment of this series, Sunday night’s Game 5, was a contest that will be immortalized in baseball lore. Alex Bregman dumped a 10th-inning walk-off single over the head of Corey Seager into short left field that was the finishing blow for the Dodgers in a 13-12 loss in extra innings. Bregman, who homered off Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen the night before in Game 4, once again torching the all-world reliever to give Houston a 3-2 series lead.
A five-hour, 17-minute slugfest, Game 5 gave baseball and non-baseball enthusiasts everything they could hope for in a postseason contest. It was the Cy-Young pitching matchup that saw neither pitcher survive through five innings. It was a game with huge leads, blown leads, regained leads and, in the end for the Dodgers, leads again painfully lost.
Per ESPN, Houston became just the fifth team in World Series history to rally from three deficits in a game (two of which were three-run deficits) to win it in the end. But Los Angeles also displayed resilience and a flair for the dramatic, rallying for three runs in the ninth to force extra innings. 
It must be said, Games 1 through 5 of this Fall Classic have all been incredible to take in. This brings me back to my Reilly reference. In many ways, this series has been just “too big” to handle as both a media member and a Dodgers supporter. While it is not over yet, it wouldn’t be fool’s gold to say that this year’s Fall Classic will go down as one of the finest ever played. 
Houston, coming together as a community after facing natural tragedy, is hungry for its first title in franchise history. Meanwhile, the Dodgers appear to finally have the right puzzle pieces to end their nearly three-decades-long World Series drought since the start of the season. 
The Astros will enter the confines of Dodger Stadium Tuesday night with a 3-2 series lead — nine innings away from hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy. Game 6 will be just the fifth World Series game ever played on Halloween night. No team has ever clinched a World Series title on Halloween, and the Dodgers are certainly hoping this will still ring true when they wake up on Wednesday morning. Los Angeles will need
back-to-back victories to secure its first World Series trophy since 1988. 
A day marked by ghosts, ghouls and goblins, Halloween is the annual holiday centered around fear. The Dodgers themselves encounter a scary reality Tuesday night: going up against Astros pitcher Justin Verlander in an elimination game and facing a Houston lineup loaded with ERA-killers like Jose Altuve and Carlos Correa.
Tuesday night’s contest will end one of two ways: The Dodgers will either be the character in the horror flick who is brutally slain in the dark forest, or they will emerge as the resilient survivor who withstood the violent onslaught, which in this case would be surviving to see a Game 7. 
Halloween baseball at its finest.
