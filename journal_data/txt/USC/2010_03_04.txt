The Marshall Center for Global Innovation, part of the Marshall School of Business, recently received a $1 million donation that will effectively double the center’s budget.
The center, established four years ago, performs research on how innovation helps firms succeed in today’s global environment. Working with universities and research centers around the world, the center uses actual market data to examine the factors that make businesses successful.
Don Murray, who earned his master’s degree at the Leventhal School of Accounting, decided to give the center $1 million over the course of the next six to seven years to help spur further research.
James Ellis, dean of the Marshall School of Business, said the donation is essential in continuing the work of the Center for Global Innovation and its director, Gerard Tellis.
“The significance of such a donation is that it allows one of our major research professors the ability to continue his cutting-edge work without worrying about a funding source,” Ellis said. “This is a critical component of USC being a major research university and the Marshall School of Business being a contributor to that vision.”
Murray, along with his wife, Carol, has been a benefactor of the center since its inception. The Murrays’ previous gifts helped fund research on the evolution of technology and the factors that spread innovation across borders.
The two saw potential in Tellis’ work and made the donation to further his efforts.
“Professor Tellis’ research allows us to understand what makes an organization or culture innovative,” Murray said in a press release. “We look forward to this important work being replicated to drive all types of innovation, whether in science, industry, academia or government. I am enthused to see USC Marshall on the vanguard for innovation — to help create a global culture where innovation is fostered and supported.”
Ellis agreed Tellis’ work is among the most innovative at Marshall.
“Marketing Professor Gerard Tellis is one of the most productive professors at the Marshall School of Business,” Ellis said. “He has done exhaustive research on the innovativeness of companies and even countries, as well as the history of innovation … This will enable Professor Tellis to continue his research in that area.”
Tellis said the gift will allow him to keep more research assistants on staff and produce research more efficiently.
“This is a very generous gift — a big deal,” Tellis said. “It will primarily pay for labor, the salaries of employees — we have five student workers and a supervisor — research assistants, conferences and travel.”
From its beginnings, the center has developed tools that can aid companies in improving performance through innovation. Among these tools are the Innovation Payoff, which measures the stock market returns because of innovative activity, and the Technology Predictor, which forecasts when in the future certain platform technologies will become dominant.
In addition, the center annually publishes the Firm Index, the Country Index and the Research and Development Center Index. These indices rank, according the center’s criteria, the most innovative companies, the most innovative countries and the best places for research and development in the world.

The USC Interfraternity Council has decided to implement a new office hours requirement, replacing the mandatory study session that many saw as ineffective.
Traditionally, IFC has held weekly, on-campus study sessions, which were mandatory for new members. The new-member grade point average, however, has been noticeably lower than the overall IFC GPA for a number of years and IFC decided it was time to find a solution.
Beginning this semester, IFC is requiring all new members to attend each of their professors’ office hours at least once a month and verify their visits with signatures.
Ben Gallant, the organization’s vice president for scholarship, said he saw the need for a change based on his own experiences and feedback from the fraternity presidents.
“Study hours was not a productive use of my time,” Gallant said. “When you’re sitting in a room with your friends, not much will get done.”
Gallant said the IFC opted for the office hours program because it gives new members an opportunity to review with their professors and ask questions.
IFC is hoping this new system will put the new-member GPA on par with the overall IFC GPA. Last semester the new-member GPA was 2.91, while the overall Greek male GPA was 3.29.
Parker Adams, vice president for public relations, said office hours should provide new members with a more valuable learning experience.
“Study hours didn’t create an environment that is focused on studying. We decided this system was more useful,” Adams said. “We’re also encouraging new members to go get firsthand knowledge from the people that actually give them that information.”
IFC President Eric Ronan said he has seen the rewards of establishing a student-professor relationship.
“From my experience, I’ve enjoyed getting to know my professors. I’ve gotten internship opportunities through visiting their office hours,” Ronan said. “We just like the idea of giving new members a little push toward connecting with professors.”
The office hours initiative will only apply to classes that are three or four units, Ronan said.
Though Adams recognizes that some students might abuse of the system, he said the new program is still better than study hours.
“Students faking signatures from professors — that’s the risk we are taking,” Adams said.
Nevertheless, Adams still believes it’s a better system than mandated study hours.
Gallant, aware of this potential problem, has come up with a solution.
“I will randomly select professors’ e-mails to check to see if students have visited them. The main target will be bigger-sized classes,” Gallant said.
In addition to raising the new-member GPA, IFC is hoping to accomplish long-term goals as a result of this initiative.
“If we can improve freshman grades, then the overall GPA will improve,” Adams said. “This will better reflect the Greek system. By requiring new members to enhance their learning outside the classroom, we will improve the student-professor relationship.”
Sergio Calix, an undecided freshman who was a new member last semester, said he sees pros and cons in both the old and new systems.
“The study hours were effective because it took two hours out of the day I needed for studying, and they also had tutors,” Calix said.
Still, he said the system was ineffective because most new members just spent the time socializing.
Calix said he thinks the office hours initiative could help improve new-member GPA.
Yet Calix said the IFC should go even one step further in reorganizing the system.
“Office hours in addition to tutors would be a great combination,” Calix said, “That would have helped me a lot during my pledge semester.”
Ronan added that this is the best system to date, but he is open to alternate solutions in the future.
“We are hoping this idea works, but, if we find after a semester or year from now that nothing is really changing, I’m okay with having a new idea,” he said.

For the first time ever, USC will unite its medical and engineering schools to help inspire breakthroughs in medical technology.
The new Health Sciences Technology program, or HST@USC, is a joint effort between the Keck School of Medicine and the Viterbi School of Engineering. The program, which creators say is the only one of its kind, will give engineering and medical graduate students the opportunity to work with and learn from each other as well as learn how the two fields can come together.
Terence Sanger, provost associate professor of Viterbi, was appointed the academic director of the Health Sciences and Technology program in August. He trained in engineering and medicine in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, which is the model for HST@USC.
Sanger said HST@USC originally planned to create an engineering-oriented medical school, but the plan has since evolved.
“We don’t want to teach engineers to be doctors or doctors to be engineers,” Sanger said. “We just want to take the best engineers and teach them how to work with doctors.”
Initially, the program will consist of 20 students — 10 Ph.D engineering students and 10 medical students. The students will take some classes in their main fields and some courses that will bring the two groups together. For example, engineering students will take an introduction to critical medicine course alongside medical students to become more familiar with the language of physicians.
Sanger said the program will also offer a project course where students will be broken up into groups of two medical and two engineering students and be asked to come up with concrete solutions to medical problems.
“The expectation is that varied expertise will lead to different discussion than would happen if it were all med students,” Sanger said. “Engineers will bring a fresh viewpoint with the questions that can be asked and how problems can be solved.”
Allan Abbott, associate dean for curriculum at Keck, said one application of medical technology produced by the union of medicine and engineering is the concept of an iPhone application that could monitor blood pressure and send it out to be documented. He said he hopes the program at USC will lead to the development of more creative concepts.
“If we collaborate with engineers and doctors, both at the instructor and student level, we’re more likely to be able to come to new solutions than if we work separately,” Abbott said.
Elizabeth Fini, vice dean for research at the Keck School of Medicine, said one of HST@USC’s goals is to break down barriers and create a better flow of ideas between the medical and engineering students and faculty. She added the two fields have an almost symbiotic relationship.
“Engineers have technology that they need to apply, and physicians need technology,” Fini said. “You need to get these people together.”
Sanger said though many other schools are interested in combining science, engineering and medicine, the kind of explicit collaboration planned for HST@USC is unique. USC’s program is distinct even from its model, the Harvard-MIT program, which features medical school training with emphasis in engineering and science.
“I don’t think there are any medical programs across the U.S. that integrate medicine with engineering like this,” Sanger said.
There is a reason this integration is uncommon, Fini said.
“It’s not as easy as it sounds,” she said. “Lots of schools try to integrate medicine and engineering, but it’s difficult when everyone is in their own world and they don’t always understand each other. Engineers don’t speak the same language as physicians.”
Sanger said one of HST@USC’s goals is to address this problem.
“It’ll be about developing the language between medicine and engineering,” Sanger said.
The program is still in the early curriculum development stage, but Sanger says the goal is to begin the courses in fall 2011.
HST@USC will seek engineering students interested in health care applications as well as medical students with some degree of an engineering background.
“There are students in undergraduate engineering programs considering medical school and deciding whether or not they want to turn off the engineering part of their brain for four years,” Sanger said. “As part of HST, they wouldn’t have to.”
Sanger said having a group of students explicitly trained to work between the two fields would be a boon to both the Keck and Viterbi schools. He said the program’s goal isn’t to change anyone’s expertise but teach students how to use what they know.
“We want to work on our strengths in both medicine and engineering,” Sanger said. “We can form new bonds and do research that wouldn’t have been possible before.”
Abbott said the program will benefit students in both fields.
“The idea is to give engineering students some experience dealing with patients and medical problems and med students having some exposure to biomedical engineering through patient care experiences,” Abbott said.

With a 100 percent increase in thefts from cars near campus since this time last year, Department of Public Safety officials are warning members of the USC community to remove valuable items from their cars to help prevent burglaries.
Since the beginning of the semester, there have been 32 reports of property stolen from cars in North University Park, according to DPS officials. DPS Crime Analyst and Crime Prevention Specialist Wyman Thomas said at this time last year there had been 16 burglaries.
Secure? · Cars in Parking Structure X might seem safe, but burglars often steal GPS units and other electronics from cars in parking structures. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
According to the crime reports, burglars typically gain entry to a car by smashing the passenger window. DPS officials said the most common items stolen are GPS navigational units, but thieves also steal iPods, cell phones and wallets. The total value of items reported stolen has reached $14,850.
The recent spike in thefts from cars has prompted DPS to reach out to the USC community, warning students in an e-mail to keep valuables out of sight when they leave their cars parked.
“If we can get people to not make things so attractive, then that would help make it go away because there isn’t anything to take,” Thomas said.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said items like GPS units and iPods are “easy scores” for burglars, as they are portable and can be easily concealed.
“These are popular items that thieves can steal and quickly turn around and sell for profit,” Carlisle said.
Echoing Thomas’ sentiment, Carlisle said the best step in preventing car burglaries is to stow electronics when leaving the car.
“One of the best ways to stop people from breaking into cars is to have people keep their valuables out of sight,” Carlisle said.
The crimes have been occurring in alleys, backstreets and parking structures.
Aside from advising students to take precautionary measures, DPS is also implementing various patrol operations and strategies to address these problems. Methods include undercover officers, bicycle officers and increased patrols. DPS also holds weekly crime analysis meetings to address any trends or increases in crime.
Thomas said a strong DPS presence is key in helping to deter car thieves but admitted, “We are being visible, but we can’t be at every corner by every car; it becomes a serious challenge for us to be everywhere at the same time.”
Sydney Mills, a senior majoring in fine arts, was a victim of a car burglary while on a trip in San Francisco that resulted in the loss of her clothes, textbooks and camera. Since then, Mills said she is particularly careful.
“I normally try not to keep anything in my car. I’m still paranoid,” Mills said. “Most of the time it’s people passing by and seeing something that they can grab. I think if you don’t have anything noticeable, you won’t have your car broken into.”
Gabriel Becerra, a freshman majoring in applied mathematics, said he feels keeping his items out of sight is enough to keep his property safe.
“I’ll cover up anything that looks like something someone would like to steal because, if they can’t see it, then they won’t think there is anything there,” he said. “They don’t want to take a chance breaking into a car where there isn’t anything worth taking.”
DPS suggests keeping any portable device or valuable items, including loose change, in trunks. Carlisle said burglars will not take the time to try to open a trunk if they can’t see that there is anything of value inside.
Carlisle said it only takes seconds for burglars to break into a car, but they won’t bother breaking in if they are not sure something is there.
“Usually they break into cars when they see something of value inside,” said Carlisle.
Thomas hopes the combined efforts of the community and the high visibility of DPS will make the burglars go elsewhere.
“Our goal is to have the bad guys think that we are everywhere,” said Thomas. “We want to send a message to the perpetrators that this area is being watched.”
How many students are the perpetrators of these crimes?  Think it’s not possible?  Think again.

Spring break came early for the No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team (8-6, 6-5) these past nine days.
But through a period that most college students would revel in, whether by sipping exotic drinks, tanning by the pool or just celebrating a few days of freedom, the Trojans spent their longest break of the season in a much different fashion.
In fact, their nine-day layoff couldn’t have come at a better time. For a team that came into the season with such high expectations, these past few weeks have represented what appears to be rock bottom.
A rock bottom that comes on the heels of dropping five of its past seven matches, losing every first set over the past month and faltering at a time when most elite teams would hope to be peaking.
But for an experienced unit that knows all about the dog days of winter, a little time off from competition these past nine days was put to great use, as they used the break to regain something that has been missing for some time — their psyche.
“The mood on the team has transformed from one of arrogance and disdain to enthusiasm and support,” senior middle blocker Hunter Current said. “We are fusing all our physical and intellectual strengths to combat any potential for weakness on the court.”
So while their reprieve from the rigor of a physically draining conference schedule didn’t include any fun in the sun, a mental makeover could be just the thing the Trojans needed as they prepare to face Mountain Pacific Sports Federation foe, the No. 10 Santa Barbara Gauchos (9-8, 6-5), tonight at the Galen Center.
With the Gauchos coming to town for the 7 p.m. clash, preparation will be paramount for USC, as UCSB comes in as the hottest team in the conference, winning four straight.
The team’s recent success has been due in large part to the number of key contributors the Gauchos have been able to rely on throughout the year.
From outsider hitter Jeff Menzel (already fourth on the all-time list for kills in a career) to opposite hitter Jake Rosener (leads team in digs), the Gauchos enter tonight’s match as one of the most balanced teams in the land. Despite an embarrassing 0-4 start to their season, UCSB looks like a team poised to make a run in the NCAA tournament.
For the Trojans, the key to notching a third straight home victory over UCSB will be their poise and ability to play mistake-free volleyball. It sounds obvious, but these two factors have plagued the team throughout its current dry spell.
“There has been ample time for us to rework our mind-set, the team dynamic and attitude towards the game of volleyball,” Current said.
But tonight, as USC attempts to turn a page in its season it would rather not dwell on, the team is cognizant that the past cannot be changed, but how it competes from here on out has yet to be set in stone.
“We lost to the three of the best teams according to their record, and, while we all want to win in a conference like this, a team is not going to go undefeated or even close to it,” sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli said. “We just need to push on from here and look to the future rather than regretting the past.”

The USC women’s tennis team hopes to bounce back after back-to-back losses from two tough Pac-10 foes, No. 5 California and No. 4 UCLA.
Today the No. 12 Women of Troy (7-4) will take on the unranked Oregon Ducks in a conference match in Eugene, Ore.
Oregon (5-7) enters the week after a pair of 4-3 losses to Purdue and Indiana, in addition to a 4-1 loss at Ohio State last week. Oregon has no nationally-ranked players or doubles team.
USC is 13-0 all-time against the Ducks after a 7-0 win last season at Marks Stadium.
USC features four singles players ranked in the top 100 of the most recent ITA poll, including the No. 3 overall player in the nation, junior Maria Sanchez. The junior is 8-1 for the season in duals at the top singles spot and is coming off a dominant 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 win over UCLA’s No. 5 ranked Yasmin Schnack on Wednesday.
“No matter who our competition is, we always want to win,” Sanchez said. “We have to just go out there prepared for a tough match, and hopefully we can get some momentum going after our two recent losses.”
USC will play its first Pac-10 match of the season today at 1:30 p.m. in Eugene, Ore.

The USC women’s basketball team moved one step closer to the NCAA tournament with a narrow 55-53 victory over Arizona.
All-around · Sophomore Ashley Corral had nine points and six assists to help the Women of Troy beat Arizona late Thursday night at home. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
USC (17-11, 11-6) recorded its fourth straight victory in a game marked by a series of runs.  The Women of Troy led by as many as 13 points in the second half before allowing Arizona (13-15, 6-11) to close within one point in the final minute.
“I thought it was a very well played game for about 35 minutes for us, but at this particular time we’re taking wins,” USC coach Michael Cooper said.  “It wasn’t a pretty win, but it was a win we have to take to continue what we are striving to do.”
Sophomore guard Ashley Corral knocked down one of two free throws the final margin.  The Wildcats missed an open three-pointer in the final seconds.
Junior center Kari LaPlante led USC with 13 points, six rebounds and three blocked shots.  The Women of Troy capitalized early on a size advantage down low with LaPlante and freshman forward Christina Marinacci.  The duo combined for 13 points and seven rebounds in the first half and helped USC take an early lead.
“Tonight Kari was very active rebounding for us and I thought that was a big plus as well as scoring when she got her opportunities,” Cooper said.  “And again, you can’t pass up on her size.”
A late surge propelled USC to a double-digit halftime lead.  Senior guard Hailey Dunham started the run with a pair of fast break layups, the first coming off a highlight-reel pass from Corral.  Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath ended the run with a midrange jumper right before the halftime buzzer.
Arizona came back in the second half behind some stellar play from forward Ify Ibekwe, who scored 16 of her 18 points in the half.  Ibekwe missed much of the first half with foul trouble.  A jump shot with 27 seconds left brought the Wildcats within one at 54-53.
Gilbreath finished with 10 points on 4 of 15 shooting but added eight assists and three steals for the Women of Troy.  Backcourt mate Corral set the single-season school record for three-pointers with a pair of threes in the game.  She finished with nine points and six assists.
“Records are always fun to have,” Corral said.  “Right now I’m more focused on getting us to the NCAA tournament and getting this next win against Arizona State because I think that will take us into a good ride into the Pac-10 tournament.”
She finished with nine points and six assists.
USC wraps up the regular season with a home game against Arizona State on Saturday.

Looking to extend its current winning streak to 10 games, the newly crowned No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will have its hands full on Saturday, as No. 4 California heads south to McDonald’s Swim Stadium to face off against the Women of Troy.
Big scorer · Junior driver Joelle Bekhazi has 18 goals this season. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Following an impressive performance at the UC Irvine Invitational, where the Women of Troy (11-1, 1-0) captured the tournament title with a resounding victory over then-No. 1 Stanford, the Women of Troy will take on a familiar conference foe in the Golden Bears (12-4, 2-1) — a team they have enjoyed much success against in recent years.
Just last week they defeated Cal 10-5 in the semifinals of the UCI Invitational, and they currently hold a 10-game winning streak against their Northern California rivals. Nonetheless, the Women of Troy remain focused.
“You have to be careful not to overlook any of your opponents,” said senior two-meter Kami Craig. “Cal is a very strong team this year. We know we have to play good defense and strong offense to beat them, so we have to prepare like any other game and get ready for a battle out there.”
But despite their recent struggles against USC, the Golden Bears still remain a serious threat to the Women of Troy’s conference title aspirations. For one, Cal, which is still ranked in the top five, features one of the most dangerous goal scorers in the country — sophomore driver Emily Csikos.
Csikos, who is also a member of the Canadian national team, and has already scored 42 goals this season, placing her among the nation’s best. Through just 16 games, Csikos averages nearly three goals per game and remains a nightmare for opposing defenses.
“We always have to know where she is in the pool and play tight defense on her,” Craig noted. “If we know someone has the ability to score that much in one game or a season, we’re definitely watching out for her the entire game.”
Craig also looks to continue her strong play in recent weeks. Craig, who scored four goals in the conference opener against Hawai’i and four goals in the UCI Invitational, was honored Monday with the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week for the third time in her illustrious career.
But as usual, the Women of Troy will not rely on one player to shoulder the load on offense and will instead resort to a balanced offensive attack.
“We have a lot of girls who get points up on the board,” Craig said. “Everyone has the confidence to shoot the ball. No one is scared to not shoot the ball. Everyone is just going after it and we make it happen.”
If the Women of Troy can once again spread the offense around, it’s quite likely that their current winning streak against Cal would extend to 11 straight victories.

Try to remember the most frustrating sports moment you have ever had — whether you were playing on the field, watching from the stands or just following the game on television.
Try to remember just how depressing, upsetting and maddening that moment was for you, how nothing could shake the incident from your mind and how a million scenarios of how it could’ve gone differently remained saved in your head for days or weeks to follow.
Then try to imagine that defeat coming at the hands of your most bitter rival, a team that, year in and year out, you focus solely on beating no matter the circumstance.
Now envision feeling that same emotion every year for three straight seasons.
And while that’s probably still an underestimate, this is roughly the emotional strain that members of the USC women’s water polo team have had to endure in their collegiate athletic career.
In the past three seasons, the Women of Troy have entered the NCAA tournament ranked first, second and third in the nation, respectively, notching at fewest 19 wins each year. They posted a 21-2 record at home, won two invitationals and captured a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title in that time span. In 2009, they went 24-1, swept conference play and rolled into the NCAA tournament on a 14-game win streak. Even after arriving at the NCAAs, the Women of Troy continued to perform well, winning each of their three quarterfinal-round matches.
Hard luck · Senior two-meter Kami Craig and the Women of Troy have fallen just short of the NCAA championship each of the past three years. - Amaresh Sundaram Kuppuswamy | Daily Trojan 
So what is there to complain about?
Unfortunately, it is at this point where things start to go downhill.
In 2007, it was a down-to-the-wire 7-6 semifinal heartbreaker that left the No. 3 Women of Troy out of the championship game. In 2008, No. 2 USC was able to reach the final, but an offensive stall left it with a three-goal deficit and a second-place finish. And in 2009, the team’s closest run at the title in five years was halted, as the No. 1 Women of Troy were unable to net a game-tying goal late in the match to avoid an upset.
Three consecutive years, three consecutive top-three finishes — but no title.
And to add the proverbial salt to the wound, all three of these NCAA losses came against bitter rival UCLA, who went on to win the tournament each year and now sits atop a streak of five consecutive national championships.
Obviously USC’s success outside the NCAA tournament does not go unnoticed, and the Women of Troy have solidified themselves as a perennial national title contender. But for the Women of Troy to come so close without ever tasting true victory surely has left a sour taste in their mouths.
And judging by their first-half play this season, that is a taste that the entire team wants to get rid of.
Riding a nine-game winning streak, USC has moved into the No. 1 ranking for the first time since it lost in the NCAA final last year. The team is fresh off the UC Irvine Invitational, where the Women of Troy  won all four of its tournament games by four or more goals and secured the title with a 10-6 rout of previous No. 1 Stanford. They have been held to fewer than 10 goals in a game only twice — in which they scored nine and seven — this season and now sit at 11-1 and 1-0 in the conference.
And they show no signs of letting up.
“We have a whole new attitude now and a little burning desire to get revenge,” said senior two-meter Kami Craig, who was Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Week last week.
Having played nine of its first 12 matches on the road, USC now has six home games in a row to settle in for. Considering how USC have dominated at McDonald’s Swim Stadium over the past few years, I’d be willing to bet that a return home is an advantage the team does not take lightly.
“There is nothing like playing at home,” Craig adds. “You have your home crowd, you’re at your home pool and you have the home-court advantage like everybody says.”
If the Women of Troy can continue their success, they more than likely will find themselves two months down the road in the NCAA tournament for the seventh consecutive season.
And while anything could happen there, it seems to be a certainty that there will be no shortage of effort or energy in pool for USC; not only because it is the seniors’ last opportunity to capture the title but also because it is a chance to drown out those missed opportunities of seasons passed.

The University of New Mexico is not a perennial powerhouse.
The school began playing baseball in 1899 but has advanced to the NCAA postseason only once. When it comes to ranking the greats in baseball history, USC is certainly at or near the top. New Mexico is not.
Versatile · Sophomore right hander Ben Mount will get the start on Saturday against New Mexico after pitching in relief last weekend. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan
But make no mistake about it, the Lobos can play. Just ask No. 3 Texas.
Two weeks ago, both teams opened the season in Austin, Texas, where then-No. 1 Texas dropped two of three games to unranked New Mexico.
Now, nobody is taking the Lobos lightly.
The Lobos (6-3) come to Dedeaux Field for a three-game series with the Trojans (4-4) that starts tonight. And UNM brings a lot of firepower.
Junior catcher Rafael Neda has picked up right where he left off in 2009. Through nine games, he’s hitting .447 with a team-leading two home runs and 10 RBIs. Last season, he finished the year batting over .400.
Two of his teammates, senior outfielder Chris Juarez and senior first baseman/outfielder Justin Howard, are also hitting over .400 for the season. Howard is one of the most patient hitters on the team, sporting an on-base percentage of more than .500 to complement his hitting.
The Trojans will counter with a slightly different rotation than the one they’ve used the last two weeks.
Sophomore pitcher Andrew Triggs (1-0, 5.11) will make his third start of the season in tonight’s contest. Triggs has 11 strikeouts in just over 12 innings of work.
Senior pitcher Kevin Couture      (0-0, 3.12) will also make his regular start Sunday. He pitched only one and two-thirds innings last Sunday against UCLA, leaving the game at Dodger Stadium early after being hit by a line drive in the second inning. But he is ready to go for the series finale.
Saturday’s start, however, will go to sophomore Ben Mount, instead of sophomore Chad Smith. Mount (0-1, 4.05) has pitched well for the Trojans as a starter and a reliever.
He made his lone start of the season on Feb. 23 against Loyola Marymount and went six strong innings. On Sunday, he relieved Couture and went four and one-third innings while allowing three runs.
He took the loss in the game last Sunday but pitched well in defeat. Now, he joins the weekend rotation, at least for this series.
The Lobos are in the middle of a five-game road trip. They traveled to Las Cruces, New Mexico, to take on New Mexico State and split the two-game series. They won the first game 9-6 before dropping Wednesday’s contest, 17-8.
USC last played UNM in 1985 at Dedeaux Field. The Lobos won, 7-1, but the Trojans lead the all-time series 3-1.
Tomorrow’s game is scheduled for a 6:30 p.m. start, and Sunday’s matchup will begin at 1 p.m.

It has been like a broken record on repeat for the USC men’s basketball team in the past few weeks.
Late game errors, bad shots, and, even worse, fouls plagued the Trojans (16-13, 8-9) down the stretch once again, this time as they fell to Arizona State 59-54 in Tempe, Ariz. Senior guard Mike Gerrity and junior guard Marcus Simmons led USC with 11 points each, but it was not enough to quiet the Sun Devils’ offensive attack.
Resurgence · Junior guard Marcus Simmons scored 11 points against the Sun Devils on Thursday, his best performance since he scored 11 against Loyola Marymount in November. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Sun Devils’ forward Rihards Kuksiks was a catalyst for his team’s offensive success, coming off the bench to score 24 points on 8-13 shooting. He made six of nine attempts from the three-point line, including several late threes to keep Arizona State ahead.
Both teams showed their defensive prowess early in the game, limiting the scoring and preventing either team from pulling ahead by a large margin. The Sun Devils (21-9, 11-6) stretched their lead to five on a Kuksiks three-pointer with eight minutes left in the half, but points from six different Trojans helped USC keep the score within two going into the break.
Spurts of offense from both sides finally appeared in the beginning of the second half, punctuated by three more Kuksiks three-pointers in the span of four minutes. USC managed to stay within three points of the Sun Devils up until the two-minute mark, but several costly errors sunk the Trojans — an untimely foul by sophomore guard Donte Smith allowed Ty Abbott to sink three free throws and widen the lead for Arizona State, and a minute later sophomore forward Leonard Washington was called for offensive goaltending on an easy layup by senior guard Marcus Johnson.
Despite a late three from Johnson, USC could not keep up with the Sun Devils, who remain in second place in the Pac-10 behind conference leader California.
Although a late three from Johnson pulled the Trojans within one, USC could not manage to regain the lead as the Sun Devils’ late free throw shooting sealed the victory.
While the Trojans shot 42 percent from the field — a vast improvement compared to their miserable 29 percent shooting performance against Oregon State — their 3-point shooting woes continued, as they were only able to convert 27 percent of their attempts.
Despite starting the second half of conference play with four consecutive wins, USC has now lost its last four games, dropping the Trojans into sixth place in the Pac-10. The win allows Arizona State to remain in second place behind conference leader California and keeps them in contention for a split of the Pac-10 title.
USC, with only one game left to play this year due to its postseason ban, will now travel to Arizona to face the Wildcats on Saturday. The Trojans defeated Arizona in their first conference game of the season 56-50 at the Galen Center.

Nicolas Chartier might not be sitting in the orchestra section of the Kodak Theatre with fellow Academy Award nominees Kathryn Bigelow and Jeremy Renner on Sunday evening, but he’ll have some sort of front-and-center view of the high-profile awards ceremony nonetheless.
The Hurt Locker producer, who found himself under intense scrutiny last week for soliciting votes and was subsequently barred from attending the 2010 Oscars by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, will celebrate the success of his little-film-that-could at a private screening party thrown in his honor. According to Deadline Hollywood, William Morris Endeavor global chief Graham Taylor and Blue Valentine producer Lynnette Howell are hosting the French food-catered soiree at their Venice Beach home with 100 friends and colleagues, as well as Chartier’s family, in attendance.
Although the dress code for guests is casual, Chartier will get some use out of his already-rented tuxedo as the esteemed guest of honor. And to further emulate the real deal, Taylor and Howell have also rented a red carpet for the D.I.Y. affair.
A French film sales agent and current president of Voltage Pictures, Chartier sent an e-mail on Feb. 19 to a group of Academy voters and industry figureheads that urged readers to vote for his film so “[The Hurt Locker] will win and not a $500M film.” Although he issued an apology for his “naïve, ignorance of the rules and plain stupidity” several days after the e-mail’s detonation, the Academy felt Chartier needed to be disciplined for directing a negative comment at a rival film.
Many petitions and grassroots movements have sparked since the Academy’s unfortunate announcement for the producer who is said to have singlehandedly escorted The Hurt Locker’s journey from script to screen. An integral member of The Hurt Locker team, Chartier at one point in the development remortgaged his house to help finance the $15 million needed to produce the film.
Luckily for Chartier and his defenders, he has not been removed from the list of four producers eligible for the golden statue, and will still be able to receive the Oscar if The Hurt Locker wins best picture Sunday evening — just not on national television.

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa endorsed State Assembly Speaker Karen Bass for Congress Wednesday, saying he believed she would fully represent the city of Los Angeles on the national level, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“We need representation in Congress that understands the needs of this city, the complexities of this city, the diversities of this city,” Villaraigosa said in a statement.
Bass is running to replace current Rep. Diane Watson, who is retiring at the end of her term, in the House of Representatives. If elected, Bass would represent California’s 33rd District, which is considered overwhelmingly Democratic and one of the most racially diverse in the state.
Villaraigosa told the Times that Bass was capable of handling the diverse community and has a track record of enabling political cooperation.
“No one that I know truly understands those complexities, the diversity, the need for a fair share of resources like Karen Bass,’’ Villaraigosa said.
Considered a favorite for the seat — with endorsements from Watson and LA County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas — Bass was the first African-American woman to serve as state assembly speaker.
“Karen’s abundant strengths as a public servant have always been her willingness and desire to listen carefully to the people she serves, couples with her ability to act swiftly, forcefully and sensitively to meet the needs (of) her diverse constituents,” Ridley-Thomas told Fox News.

For those unfamiliar with Owen Pallett, he is the person behind the artist pseudonym Final Fantasy. Before his third full-length album Heartland was released, Pallett was forced by a lawsuit courtesy of what should be a rather obvious entity to drop the Final Fantasy name.
Final fantasy · Heartland is Owen Pallett’s first release since being forced to change his stage name or risk a copyright infringement suit. - Photo courtesy of Domino Records  
Under that moniker, Pallett released two solid albums and proved himself to be an enigmatic live performer. Whether he is just now comfortable enough to go with his real name or if he just could not come up with another stage name, the artist formally known as Final Fantasy has chosen to please his mother and stick with the name she chose for him.
Since his live shows are one-man affairs utilizing a violin and a lot of instrumental looping, it’s almost fitting that any pretenses this artist might be a band are dropped. From now on, listeners are getting the real Owen Pallett — for better or worse. Unfortunately, it might be worse.
Theatrical, captivating tracks like “Keep The Dog Quiet” are reminiscent of Final Fantasy classics. It will be fascinating to see him playing and looping to build this track from scratch. His incredible ­— no kidding, absolutely incredible — vocals enter singing, My body is a cage / This union is a cage / About a cage / About a cage. The album is exhilarating at this point; perhaps this is a great addition to the Owen Pallett/Final Fantasy repetoire.
During a cursory listen, ears might scan past the short track, “Mount Alpertine,” and another standout “Lewis Takes Action.” Unfortunately, Owen Pallett fans are more meticulous and should be upset by the former track and those like it. “Mount Alpertine” feels like Final Fantasy-in-a-can. For an artist like Pallett, whose dramatic style moves his music into the realm of orchestral works, even the brief 49 seconds that the track takes up are crucial. An album like this needs fluidity, and the triteness of the album’s weakest tracks is jarring.
It feels pretty easy to say that this is a less impressive effort than his previous outings and though Heartland as a standalone album is enjoyable, it is not his best. The theatrics at first seem typical of the artist, but at the end of the weaker tracks an aura of over-sentimentality arises, as if they were b-sides from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. Pallett has never been lazy before, but the weak tracks are missing energy. Yeah, it’s stronger than many artists at their best, but fans expect more.
At its best — with “Keep the Dog Quiet” and “What Do You Think Will Happen Now?” — Heartland walks a breathtaking line between melodrama and post-punk, and nobody walks that line as well as Pallett. At its weakest — with “Mount Alpentine” and “E is For Estranged” — the album distracts completely from those strong moments. Pallett’s talent has always been his ability to create cohesiveness and plasticity, but the album stops Pallett from achieving this completely.
This album could certainly prove to be one that grows more appealing with time. For such an immediately charismatic performer, however, it’s perplexing that Pallett feels distant or restrained on the weak tracks. Where’s the vigor that countless audiences can confirm is well within the reach of this artist? Most likely — or at least hopefully — this is a recording mistake and hopefully will be ironed out before these songs see stage-light.
His obvious fervor for his art would suggest that Pallett is not easily deterred, and these songs should not turn away anyone interested in seeing the artist formally known as Final Fantasy in concert. In fact, many tracks from Heartland might be greatly improved by some live energy.
That’s the most telling issue with the album: All the ingredients are present for another excellent Pallett outing, but a certain energy seems to be lacking from the recordings. Despite the promise of the energetic high points of the album, his missing ingredients hinder it from being on par with his previous two releases.

Ke$ha slams Britney Spears on Lip-syncing 
New singer Ke$sha (only really known her for hit song “TiK-ToK”) is making some bold statements about her fellow artists. She has one fact that she wants everyone to know about Spears: she lip syncs her live performances.
“I don’t think that’s fair at all for people who are going to see the show,” she told Scotland’s Daily Record. “I think if you are going to be a singer, you should sing. If you are going to be a dancer, you should dance. If you are going to do a combination of the two, you should make it very clear when you are singing and very clear when you are dancing.”
Ke$sha’s comments were not in a response to any fall-out or personal controversy with Spears that could be seen. It seems like she just got sick of people thinking that Spears actually sings live.
“It’s treating people as if they are too stupid to realize you are not actually singing,” Ke$ha continued. “Sometimes it is hard to sing and dance at the same time, but I would rather be off and be real and genuine about it to my fans. I don’t want to treat my fans like they are stupid…When I am singing, I may sound s–t sometimes, but at least you’ll know I’m singing.”
Jay-Z makes a stop at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
Before Jay-Z made it to his concert in Washington D.C. he had a quick stop to make at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
During his concert at the Verizon Center at the nation’s capitol yesterday, Jay-Z told his audience that he finally got to sit down with President Obama. “I just came from the White House,” he told the audience. According to the Washington Post, Jay-Z made the comment in the last minutes of his show.
Officials confirmed to the Post on Thursday that President Barack Obama had indeed met with the Brooklyn emcee and the pair chatted briefly. In an interview overseas last month, Jay-Z revealed that when he once called President Obama he heard his CD playing in the background.
The rapper is currently on his Blueprint 3 tour around the United States. He, and his wife singer Beyoncé, were an avid supporters of Obama during the presidential campaign. Jay-Z referred to him in a series of lyrics, most notably for Young Jeezy’s hit “My President,” to which Jay-Z contributed a verse on the remix.
Mo’Nique tells all about her open marriage, hairy legs 
On Barbara Walter’s annual Oscar Special, Walters received some great interviews from the Oscar contenders including Sandra Bullock and Tom Ford. However, Mo’Nique is believed to have given the best interview, in which she talks about her open marriage with husband Sidney Hicks.
The actress said she’s never had sex outside her marriage with Hicks. But, the same might not be true for him, the NY Daily News reports. “Could Sid have sex outside of his marriage with me?” the Precious star asked. “Yes. That’s not a deal-breaker. That’s not something that would make us say, ‘Pack your things and let’s end the marriage.'”
Even if it happened more than once, Mo’Nique said she wouldn’t hold it against him. “What if it’s 20 times? So what?” she said. “We’ve been best friends for over 25 years, and we truly know who we are. Oftentimes, people get into marriages and they don’t know who they’re laying next to. I’m very comfortable and secure with my husband.”
So comfortable, in fact, that she says her hairy, unshaven legs aren’t a problem for Hicks. “He actually loves my hairy legs!” she said.
That’s pretty interesting – and nasty. Best of luck to Mo’Nique as she is up for Best Supporting Actress award at this weekend’s academy awards.
Don’t miss Walter’s Oscar Special scheduled after the award show broadcast on the West Coast.
Megan Fox: I’ve only had sex with two men 
Attention all guys. Megan Fox covers the Harper’s Bazaar magazine April issue. Inside she talks about her sex life and shares a little information about self-awareness about her branding strategy. The issue hit newsstands yesterday. Here are some excerpts from the interview:
On her sex partners:
“I’ve only been with two men my entire life. My childhood sweetheart and Brian. I can never have sex with someone that I don’t love, ever. The idea makes me sick. I’ve never even come close to having a one-night stand.”
On giving provocative interviews:
“My biggest regret is that I’ve assisted the media in making me into a cartoon character. I don’t regret what has happened to me, but I regret the way I have dealt with it.”
On her sex scene in the upcoming DC Comics adaptation Jonah Hex:
“I had on underwear and silicone covers that you wear over your breasts. My body parts are all I have left now that are only mine — the world owns everything else.”
yeah I had heard about Mo’s hairy scary legs..maybe that’s what’s keeping her marriage so open!

There are few characters in film that are more glorified than police officers. Whether honest or corrupt, to be a cop on screen is to add flair and poignancy to a job that, while noble in actuality, is hardly ever glorified in the same manner.
Throughout film history, cops have been romanticized, cast as saviors or sometimes even condemners. The new film Brooklyn’s Finest, which opens today, continues this feverish trend of Hollywood.
Brooklyn’s Finest depicts the lives of three Brooklyn police officers whose erratic presence — both positive and negative — as law enforcement demands they each face the same violent resolution. Richard Gere plays a cop with a severe drinking problem who is on the verge of retirement, Ethan Hawke is a desperate officer questioning the benefits of corruption and Don Cheadle is an undercover narcotics officer with numerous connections in the drug world.
All three must decide how best to serve and protect their community, since each officer’s decision will greatly impact his reputation as a civil servant.
This is what cop films are all about: the struggle and absolute weariness that comes from working such a strenuous job and how it affects their ability to be the police officers they are supposed to be. The prestige Hollywood has so long bestowed upon figures charged with keeping the peace — moral and immoral alike — comes from this turmoil: In big-screen portrayals, cops seem to embody great service while always contending with the possibility of an even greater loss.
One of Hollywood’s classic cop films is director William Wyler’s 1951 Detective Story, starring Kirk Douglas as detective Jim McLeod. The film depicts a single day in the lives of hardboiled detectives at the crime-plagued 21st precinct, but, most specifically, the film revolves around McLeod’s endless pursuit of an abortionist.
Turmoil and its effect on the officers is the focus here, but social issues like abortion make the job more than just a job, especially for McLeod, who slowly loses his patience and his morality as the overwhelming strain of upholding the law begins to set in.
Director James Mangold (Walk the Line) assembled one of the most stellar ensemble casts for his 1997 film Cop Land. Sylvester Stallone portrays a somber sheriff who must govern a small New Jersey town that has been designed specifically for cops to live in, including New York Police Department officers portrayed by Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro.
Stallone’s character, who was unable to join the NYPD, envies all of his friends and neighbors who head into the city everyday to live out his dream. He builds them up in his mind until he discovers that his cop friends and the town they call home are nothing more than a front for the Mafia.
Mangold’s illustration of corruption toys with the very act of glorification, suggesting that it can sometimes be enormously misdirected, a theme echoed that same year in director Curtis Hanson’s 1997 contemporary noir L.A. Confidential. The glamour and celebrity lifestyles of 1950s Hollywood are played out in the lives of the many police officers who must investigate a brutal homicide that unravels into a ruthless police conspiracy.
The glorification present here goes beyond all others because it literally depicts police officers — Kevin Spacey’s character in particular — as having fame on par with the real-life celebrities they’re investigating. The police officers in L.A. Confidential eventually become famous to the point at which distinguishing between the cops and the celebrities is impossible, and as a result, legitimacy is lost.
More and more contemporary cop films deal with police corruption as well as citizens’ unending disappointment in the service.
Director Antoine Fuqua (who also directed Brooklyn’s Finest) parallels this trend of romanticizing brutality in 2001’s Training Day. A young narcotics officer must learn the ropes from a veteran detective played by Denzel Washington who also happens to use his power as a ruthless weapon, governing both criminals and civilians in Los Angeles.
Washington’s character — whose portrayal garnered the actor an Oscar for best actor — is a violent man whose misuse of power are glorified with the same vigor that an honest police officer’s actions would be, but, as many cop films throughout film history have proven, the characters that are truly put on a pedestal are those officers who see themselves as more than just civil servants.
It’s with this same mentality that Fuqua unveils Brooklyn’s Finest, and, in relation to cinema’s most recognizable detectives of the past who always seem to have more fun being bad than good, the newest depiction of law enforcement will incorporate honesty as well as corruption. It’s a safe bet that Brooklyn’s Finest will only perpetuate Hollywood’s fascination with police officers: Decent or not, cops will always be cinematically engaging.

For seasoned filmmaker Tim Burton, negotiating the fine line between his role as a sweetheart of Hot Topic patrons and a director exploring the boundaries of commercial viability is a full-time job. Alice in Wonderland’s wide release opening today marks the director’s most recent effort to darken the silver screen.
Red scare · Helena Bonham Carter’s bloodthirsy Red Queen terrorizes Underland, the fantastic world Alice mistakenly once called “Wonderland.” - Photos courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures 
In the film, Burton tells the story of the marriageable Alice Kingsley’s (Mia Wasikowska) inadvertent tumble into the topsy-turvy world of Underland — unbeknown to Alice, it’s a return journey for her.
Fleeing the pressure of a wealthy lord’s proposal, Alice escapes to the alternate reality lying far beneath a gnarled tree root. After properly resizing herself with shrinking tonics and enlarging pastries that will be familiar to anyone at all acquainted with Carrollian lore, the chronically dazed-looking girl finds herself in a world where she’s constantly accused of being “the wrong Alice” or, more worrisome for her, the right one.
The case of mistaken identity stems from a prophecy made by an all-foreseeing Oraculum scroll that pictures a bushy-haired champion slaying the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which the bloodthirsty and cranially endowed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) uses to keep the entire kingdom paralyzed in a state of fear and submission. Ever since it was forcibly wrested from the control of her dainty and bleached-out younger sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Underland and its denizens have secretly yearned for the restoration of the peaceful White Queen, a pacifist by oath. Animals and humans alike — seeking to overthrow the Red Queen, Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter and Michael Sheen’s White Rabbit — all nudge the reluctant Alice along on her path to free Underland from the Red Queen’s reign.
For those familiar with Burton’s extensive filmography, there’s little surprising in his latest offering. In keeping with the director’s penchant for visual spectacle, Burton’s vision of Underland is a darkly vivid fantasyland replete with unimaginable flora, fearsome fauna and larger-than-life personalities at every turn.
More so than any other filmmaker, Burton seems to have benefited from the explosion of new computer-generated technologies. In much the same way that George Lucas delayed production on the first trilogy in his six-part Star Wars saga, recognizing the 1970s technology available to him at the time was incompatible with his vision for the story, moviegoers get the feeling that Burton had put off his interpretation of the Lewis Carroll classic until the technology and finances were less of a limiting factor.
Almost no portion of the film was untouched by some form of movie magic: Acres upon acres were created from nothing, key characters were entirely engineered by computer and it’s unlikely that even one square inch of skin that appeared on camera wasn’t obscured by makeup.
Beginning with his stop-motion adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic James and the Giant Peach, Burton has had his name on more than a few interpretations of beloved childhood texts, including 2005’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory — considerably darker but not necessarily creepier than 1971’s Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder.
The increasing commercialization of Burton’s visions makes for products that are often unrecognizable when compared to the director’s earlier work. The Technicolor dreamscape viewers are presented with in Alice bears almost no similarity to 1990’s Edward Scissorhands, for instance, let alone Ed Wood. It’s very likely Burton’s partnerships with big-name studios like Walt Disney Pictures for Alice and Warner Bros. Pictures for Corpse Bride and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory require that Burton at least somewhat reign in his unabashedly gruesome sensibilities, if only for the sake of marketability. Thirty-nine years since his directorial debut, Burton has run squarely into the paradox of success. While working on these blockbusters, the polarizing director has most likely had to compromise his vision — if not outright sacrifice it in some instances — for commercial viability.
Alice’s cast, heavy on returners, suggests that Burton’s group of stock actors is possessed of a devotion on par with Christopher Guest and Wes Anderson’s respective troupes. Long-time collaborators Johnny Depp and Alan Rickman are both working with the director for the umpteenth time, as is Burton’s unspeakably talented partner, Helena Bonham Carter.
The quality of the film’s performances run the gamut. Wasikowska’s Alice is appropriately distracted and ethereal — she’s convinced that her entire experience in Underland is a dream. Stephen Fry perfectly channels the Cheshire Cat from the original Disney animated classic, and Alan Rickman’s Blue Caterpillar is a perfectly snarky hookah smoker. Unfortunately, Depp’s interpretation of the role of Mad Hatter is a disappointing amalgam of his past characters — it appeared that he simply fused the swagger of Jack Sparrow with the disconcertingly subdued lunacy of Willy Wonka, throwing in a sporadic Scottish accent for good measure in times of duress. The Red Queen was a truly unique invention, however, and Bonham Carter’s unsleeping paranoia coupled with insatiable bloodlust makes for a terrifying interpretation of the role.
There’s only so much imagination that a director could be expected to bring to a text as familiar as Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass. But unlike most problems, the issue of well-worn material can in some way be remedied by throwing money at it — if that money is channeled toward realizing a vision of a world turned upside down.

This Sunday’s annual Academy Awards wants you to tune in. After suffering lagging ratings in the last three ceremonies, they’ve decided to nominate 10 films for the best picture category in an effort to let more popular movies slip in, unlike the more esoteric films of past Oscar seasons.
This move, however, encourages a disturbing trend: Can consumers appreciate future experimental — and not necessarily economically successful — films if they label big-money blockbusters like Avatar as worthy of being called best picture?
With studios prepared to make movies out of Facebook (The Social Network) and board games (Battleship) to fill a successful model that has rewarded GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra and The Twilight Saga: New Moon with insane profits, the lines blur. While the Oscars might be a corporate enterprise, they should at least hold on to some semblance of respecting art instead of popularity.
The choice to double the nominations for best picture was announced last summer, a year and a half after the show’s ratings plummeted to the lowest they had ever been since Nielsen started tracking viewers in 1974. Coincidentally, the film that won best picture that year, No Country For Old Men, placed 36th for domestic gross that year, earning less money than Ghost Rider.
The most watched Oscar telecast was in 1998 when a romantic drama called Titanic picked up 11 little gold guys — after, of course, racking up the most domestic gross of all time as 55 million Americans on their couch cheered on.
That record, of course, was recently snatched up by another James Cameron film, Avatar, which could very well win.
The reason the Academy Awards has had flagging ratings is because potential audience members preferred to see Pirates of the Caribbean instead of Atonement.
The problem is that the hunger to consume certain movies has to come from the individual and people are choosing to only shell out money to watch buildings explode on screen.
One can wax poetic about the nature of film and the communal experience of sharing a two-hour moment with a room of strangers, the magic of being moved by some story on the screen that mirrors some poignant part of the soul — but really, in the end it’s about ratings and numbers.
Can we blame the Oscars for letting blockbusters slip into the upper echelons of film recognition in a world where we have splintered lucrative mass media with iPods with individualized playlists and TiVo-ed programming?
No.
But though the Oscars certainly aren’t the only indicator of what makes a movie great, the awards should be meant to recognize movies that might not have made billions of dollars but inspired or moved individuals.
So go out there, Trojans, and go see a movie. Watch one of 10 fine nominated films up for a huge paperweight Sunday night. Heck, borrow a good one from past years at Leavey; it’s free.
Maybe it’ll prompt you to boost the Oscar ratings.

Good stuff.  Great films do not mean great revenue…watch some films with passion, emotion and meaning….foreign films are also more creative and sould searching than most ‘formula films’ made here…

The USC men and women’s tennis teams dominated the competition last week, culminating in the recognition of two players as Pac-10 Players of the Week.
Junior Maria Sanchez received the Pac-10 Women’s Tennis Player of the Week honor for the second time in her career and sophomore Daniel Nguyen was named the Pac-10 Men’s Tennis Player of the Week for the first time.
Sanchez finished last week with two wins, including an upset over California Berkeley’s Jana Juricova. Juricova, a sophomore, became Berkeley’s first ITA National Indoor Championship singles champion on November 8.
Sanchez defeated Juricova with a decisive 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 victory, and her overall record improved to 16-5 in singles matches. She also has a record of 8-1 in dual-match singles play this season. Sanchez is currently ranked number 3 in the nation in singles, and was considered the top California recruit after her senior year of high school.
Nguyen received Player of the Week honors after winning a crucial match against Matt Kandath of 14th ranked Stanford to give USC to an early lead against the Cardinal. His overall singles record is currently 20-5 and by defeating Kandath 6-2, 6-1, Nguyen set the stage for his later win in doubles.
Teamed with partner Steve Johnson, Nguyen helped win the match 9-8 against Stanford’s No. 23 doubles pair of Richard Wire and Alex Clayton. Though Nguyen and Johnson are unranked, they currently have a 4-0 record as a doubles pair.
The USC women’s tennis team will play at Oregon on Friday, while the men’s tennis team will resume play on March 10 at Wake Forest.

For all the calorie-conscious students out there, there’s a new law in town — and it’s going to ruin all your future visits to The Cheesecake Factory.
In September 2008, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bill that aimed to provide California diners with full nutritional information about the food offered at restaurant chains with 20 or more locations.
The law has a two-part roll-out. In July 2009, restaurants began to provide brochures with calorie content and other health facts to anyone brave enough to request such information. Although it might spoil your lunch, if you really want to investigate the number of grams of fat or milligrams of sodium in your burrito at Baja Fresh, you can now find out.
Coming up is phase two which states that on Jan. 1, 2011, these restaurants will have to post their nutritional information directly on their menus. That’s right — that slice of dulce de leche cheesecake won’t look so tempting when you’re able to see that it’ll set you back a cool 1,010 calories (that’s half of an your recommended daily intake!).
Legislation like this has been introduced in a dozen other states and regions, and will likely spread as our nation attempts to rethink the way it eats.
According to the National Restaurant Association 49 percent of every food dollar in the U.S. is now spent in restaurants, up from 25 percent in 1955. That means that most people are eating out for the majority of their meals, which means they’re almost definitely consuming far more calories than their bodies require.
The real question though is whether or not people will actually change their food selections when faced with a bunch of numbers they may not even understand.
Some studies reported in the Los Angeles Times seem to indicate that hungry humans will continue eating what we know and love no matter how bad they may be for our bodies.
So while this new law is an admirable step towards a healthier population, it may not have as strong of an impact as its creators would like. You’ll be able to decide for yourself how you want the new law to affect your own eating decisions in less than a year.
And who knows? Gym memberships might be the ultimate winner here.

On Wednesday evening, the Marshall School of Business’ Society and Business Lab, in conjunction with the School of Cinematic Arts and the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking screened Kavi, a Oscar-nominated short film about a young modern-day slave laborer working in a brick kiln in India. Through its heartfelt depictions, the film sheds important light on the country and its social problems. More importantly, Kavi makes it starkly known that slavery still exists everywhere in the world today. In fact, the current number of slaves number is approximately 27 million, more slaves than history has ever known.
Definitively, slavery can be described as the restriction of ones freedom to move, which includes much more than the slavery written in history books. For one, such a restriction consists of human trafficking and, in a way, the millions of people who leave their countries to find work out of necessity, based on oppressive economic factors.
Many Southeast Asian businesses depend on these kinds of employees, migrant workers who provide inexpensive labor, to keep their countries competitive with rising giants China and India. On the other end, the system allows workers to find productive employment in host countries.
On Tuesday, the Thai Labor Ministry enacted a new immigration policy aimed at better monitoring its labor force. Unregistered foreign migrant workers had to either seek new work permits or request to have their citizenship validated, disrupting the country’s heavy reliance on migrant workers. The policy was leveraged with the threat of arrest and deportation for those who didn’t comply.
According to the International Migrants Alliance (IMA), there are more than 1.4 million migrant workers in Thailand, mostly originating from the Southeast Asian countries of Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. They constitute about 5 to 10 percent of the Thai work force. With that said, a reported 500,000 people did not register with local authorities and are now facing deportation.

Though the Thai government’s concerns of preserving national labor laws and keeping health and security risks at bay are legitimate, this abrasive register-or-leave policy may not be the most effective method. For one, the system apparently does not translate instructions into the workers’ native languages, making it daunting and very difficult to register.
Businesses are frantic that this will drive costs up and hurt Thailand’s economy. Low-wage businesses, predominantly textile mills and farms, have already been experiencing employment shortages and cannot afford to lose a significant portion of their workers. Deporting thousands of foreign workers may mean that wages will have to increase. For many migrant workers, like those from Myanmar, returning to their home countries might not be a safe option. Furthermore, as activists at Human Rights Watch purport, there is a lack of transparency in the country and region as a whole.
“Physical abuse, maltreatment and subhuman conditions are but a few of the bad things to come to migrant workers who will be arrested and detained once the Thai government pursues its crackdown,“ said Eni Lestari, chairperson of the IMA.
Another point of contention is the Thai government’s recent signing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, which this new policy could violate. For “humanitarian” purposes, it says, “the receiving states and the sending states shall take into account the fundamental rights and dignity of migrant workers and family members already residing with them without undermining the application by the receiving states of their laws, regulations and policies.” But what if there were a problem with the laws, regulations and policies of the state?
A classic case of overlapping authority and clashing priorities, Thailand’s immigration policy has resulted in different influential parties arguing in opposite directions. For the authorities, it seems to be an issue of an “us vs. them” ideology, where the government is concerned with preserving national boundaries and the domestic workforce, as any sovereign state is naturally apt to do. But the consequences of this recent policy will affect both migrant and domestic workers, the costs of production and, potentially, interstate relations.
Before creating such a stringent punishment, the groundwork for proper follow through needs to be set. If not, the purpose is defeated. It seems as though the laborers are left between a rock and a hard place and, as Wednesday’s discussion pointed out, there are millions similarly trapped in this situation.

Wow, just Wow. An opening paragraph about SLAVERY and then you lead in to a discussion of Thai immigration law (which is, let’s face it, a thinly-veiled discussion of OUR immigration law). The main point you seem to have is that Thailand’s insistence that immigrants have proper visas and obey the law is… inhumane? Racist maybe? The suggestion that immigrant laborers will face “physical abuse, maltreatment and subhuman conditions” if they register with the authorities is shameless. What do you think happens to them now, when they have no recourse to law enforcement, and live at the mercy of whatever unethical bosses will illegally employ them?
In Orwell’s 1984, Oceania’s fictional slogan was “war is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength”… you haven’t written anything about war and peace in this article, but two out of three isn’t bad, I guess.

Tim Tessalone is the busiest man in the USC athletic program, no doubt about it.
To grasp his impact, look no further than the last 12 months that he has spent behind the scenes trying to preserve the face of a prestigious athletic program amid an underachieving football season, coaching changes in the top two revenue sports and the threat of NCAA violations.
For a man whose job description entails him to act as the ultimate liaison between the controversy-driven media and an athletic department that seems to routinely find itself in the headlines, no single employee has a phone bill as large as Tessalone this year.
While his day-to-day activities should focus more on preparing team and player statistics for media members and the general public, working for a university whose athletic program has recently been marred by chaos has had Tessalone wearing hats most SIDs across the country wouldn’t dream of wearing.
For a program that recently has required its fair share of public relations attention, Tessalone’s ability to manage the hoard of press members that often crowd Heritage Hall is the type of work that doesn’t make it into the nightly box score. It appears someone from afar however, has been watching.
The Football Writers Association of America announced this week their first annual “Super 11” field of the top sports information departments in the country during the 2009 NCAA Division 1 Football Subdivision this week, and thanks to Tessalone and football assistant Paul Goldberg, the Cardinal and Gold are the lone Pac-10 representative on the list which also includes Buffalo, Clemson, East Carolina, Georgia, Nebraska, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, San Jose State, Texas and Utah.
“But our group felt there was a smattering of schools that merited commendation because of their exemplary work above and beyond the call of duty,” FWAA President Tim Griffin said.

For the first time since 1991, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team (12-1, 0-0) beat No. 6 UCLA (6-3, 0-0) 6-1 on the Bruins home court.
Playing their biggest rival, and winning for the first time in 19 years, makes this one of the biggest wins in program history for the Trojans.
Coach Peter Smith explained that the win had an almost championship feel.
Smith altered the doubles lineup a bit, wanting to include players who have played at UCLA in the past.
“I wanted to play guys who have been there before,” Smith said.  “It’s a tough place to win a doubles with a 1,000 people chanting for UCLA.”
The No. 13 duo of senior Robert Farah and sophomore Steve Johnson overcame the tough crowd conditions and some blustery winds to win 8-6.
No. 40 sophomore Daniel Nguyen and senior Jason McNaughton came up just short falling 8-6.
In clinching the initial match point, juniors Jaak Poldma and Peter Lucassen also came through with an 8-6 victory.
No.3 Johnson started the singles portion off well for the Trojans with a relatively quick 6-2, 6-4 victory.
UCLA’s No. 118 junior Nick Meister won the only match of the day for the Bruins, tightening up the match score at 2-1.
The final four matches all went to three sets and USC won all of them.
“It’s a great testament to win all of the three-setters, and to finish strong,” Smith said.
Poldma won at the No. 3 position, and sophomore Matt Kecki clinched the match with his 6-0, 4-6, 6-4 triumph.
Farah and Nguyen finished off the day with 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 and 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 victories, respectively.
With such a historic win under their belts, the Trojans felt the desire to eat a celebratory dinner.
As any In-N-Out deprived USC student would do, the Trojans decided to this occasion was as good as any to chow down on some tasty double-doubles.

The City of Los Angeles unveiled RecycleBank this week, a pilot program designed to encourage recycling by giving points that can be used for goods at some retail stores, according the Los Angeles Times.
Program participants are given a specialized recycling bin that is recognized by RecycleBank trucks. Such bins are equipped with electronic identification tags that allow RecyleBank to compensate participants accordingly, based on the weight of their recyclables.
People can redeem the RecycleBank points at certain retailers; currently more than 1,000 restaurants and stores accept the points, including El Pollo Loco, Tritsch True Value Hardware, CVS, Bed Bath & Beyond and Ruby Tuesday.
Though Los Angeles already recycles about 65 percent of recyclable waste, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told the Times he wants to make his city “the cleanest, greenest big city in America.”
“We are building innovative partnerships that will employ outside resources … to motivate residents to recycle more and pump money directly back into the local economy,” Villaraigosa said.
RecycleBank Chief Executive Ron Gonen said he believed the program will work because it gives people an economic incentive for recycling their beer bottles, old newspapers, plastic and other recyclables.
“For too long, people viewed doing things for the environment as the right thing to do but costly,” said RecycleBank Chief Executive Ron Gonen to the Times. “I wanted to start a movement that said smart environmental decisions were also smart economic decisions. Recycling could have the biggest impact in terms of changing that view and behavior because it touches every house.”
RecycleBank currently works with more than 50 cities in the United States. In Los Angeles, only about 15,000 homes in Los Angeles are eligible for the program, which will begin April 5 after registrants are outfitted with the specialized bins.
The pilot program will run for one to two years, according to Enrique Zaldivar, the Los Angeles director of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation.

Some pictures might say a thousand words, but a truly great photo is indescribable. This is true of many images showing at the Annenberg Space for Photography’s Sport exhibit located in Century Park.
World famous sports photographers, Walter Iooss and Neil Leifer combined their best photos to create one of the most epic and timeless sports-photography exhibits ever created. These men have captured the most unforgettable and iconic moments in sport history from Michael Jordon’s muscular dunk to Muhammad Ali’s final punch to a Tiger Woods’ victory celebration.
Leifer, at age 16, captured the Baltimore Colt’s final touchdown of 1958’s NFL Championship game. His picture, displayed in the exhibit, cemented this moment into history, making it accessible for everyone forever. Every picture breathtakingly draws the viewer into not only the power of these athletes, but also the pain and the joy of every moment in sports history that is worth reliving.
Good news, too — the exhibit has been extended. Though it will be closing on its scheduled end date of March 17 because of the popularity the exhibit — which went up in November — will reopen indefinitely on March 27.
You do not have to be a die-hard sports fan to appreciate the impressive magnitude of these pictures. With Annenberg, Sports Illustrated and two of the most prominent sports photographers converging in one art space, Sport is definitely an exhibit worth seeing.

Sandy Roberts, a sophomore majoring in cinema-television production, died Saturday night following a car accident. He was 21.

The Hollywood, Fla., native loved making people laugh and had a passion for filmmaking, but friends said they will remember Roberts most for his kindness.
“He has some of those qualities that I feel like most people lose when they leave childhood — the ability to just walk up to someone and introduce himself or tell someone flat out that he wants to be friends with them or to make dates with people to hang out,” said Hayley Huntley, a junior majoring in creative writing.
Roberts came to USC from the University School of Nova Southeastern University, a private high school in Florida, to study cinema. After spending his childhood creating sets out of construction paper and Scotch tape and making videos for various groups in high school, he decided he wanted to edit film.
Although Roberts was accepted to many top film schools, including New York University, his father, Scott Roberts, said he fell in love with USC.
“With everything that’s going on there with cinema, no place touches USC,” Scott Roberts said. “Sandy was so proud to be a part of it.”
Roberts quickly found a place for his creativity on campus, working with the teams that won the “Best Comedy” award at the Campus Movie Fest at USC both his freshman and sophomore years. The film he worked on this year went on to win an award at the regional competition in San Francisco and will be shown at the upcoming international competition.
“He was a very funny guy, and I would say that he particularly had an understanding of situational comedy and the timing of things and the juxtaposition of certain points,” said Brian Rodysill, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies who lived with Roberts since their freshman year. “That really played into his editing because that’s how you create those moments in film. He was very good at it.”
This creativity was also apparent in Roberts’ humor. Roberts was a member of Child’s Play, a nationally known children’s improv troupe based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and performed with The Merry Men, an 11-member improv group at USC, since last spring.
“He was always funny,” said Joe DeSoto, director of The Merry Men. “If he was doing great, it was funny and you were laughing with him, and if he wasn’t, you still were, if only because he was laughing too.”
“He lit up a room,” his mother, Mimi Roberts, said. “He made everything fun and happy and joyous.”

Those who performed with Roberts said he had a dynamic stage presence — he was always singing and rhyming, making bold, “outlandish” choices in the name of comedy. Even though The Merry Men is technically a British improv troupe, his fellow comedians said Roberts preferred his trademark character, an Italian baker.
“He always challenged himself. He knew he got in way over his head and he knew it and relished it. That was why he was so beneficial to our troupe because you can’t have — there’s no other Sandy Roberts,” said Mark Jacobson, a junior majoring in theatre who met Roberts through The Merry Men.
“There’s 10 of us now, but we’re always going to be 11-deep. Before a performance, we always put a foot in the middle of a circle and talk — we’re always going to be 11 feet deep,” he said.
Friends said the unique thing about Roberts’ humor was that, like Roberts himself, it was never mean-spirited.
“He’s very, very funny in a way that makes you wonder why anyone makes mean jokes or racial jokes or sexist jokes because he never needs to make any of those to be very funny,” Huntley said.
Scott Roberts credited his son’s good nature to his mother.
“He was a gentleman,” Scott Roberts said. “He got that quality because his mother taught him very good manners and very specific lessons about how to treat people.”
Roberts also learned a lot from his younger brother, Zack. The two were best friends and worked together on a variety of projects, from performing comedy routines at family gatherings to writing and producing films, listing “Roberts Brothers Productions” at the end.
“We were a team our whole life,” Zack Roberts, who is a year and a half younger than Sandy, said. “We had an unspoken way that we could work perfectly with each other. We could finish each other’s sentences and know what each other were thinking. It’s the type of thing that we would fill in the gaps for each other.”
Friendship was also important to Roberts, who formed a group of close-knit friends from the beginning of his time at USC.
“Sandy could also have this completely serious side, not where he wasn’t happy but where he would stop joking, and that’s really when you could see how passionate he was about the things he did in his life,” said Evan Moore, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “One thing he never joked about was friendship.”
“As funny as he was he also had the capability to be there when you need it,” said Katie Longawa, a sophomore majoring in critical studies who met Roberts the first week of freshman year.
Those who knew Roberts said they couldn’t think of him without thinking of Nicole Deane, his girlfriend, whom he dated for more than a year.
“When people think about Sandy, Nicole is synonymous with that and it’s vice versa. You think of Nicole, you think of Sandy,” Longawa said.
“Sandy changed her,” said Natasha Deane, Nicole’s mother. “Their relationship was as close as the joining of two people into one. She was in him and he was in her.”
Roberts was passionate about everything in his life, friends said.
“Sandy was one of the most passionate people that I knew,” Rodysill said. “He knew his interests and something could snag him and he would be very interested in it, but he would be 100 percent committed, whether it was his films or undertaking the task of doing his laundry.”
Though family and friends said they would remember Roberts for his dedication, his greatest attribute, they said, was his sincerity.
“Film was what he did, Nicole was who he was with and The Merry Men was where he did improv,” Jacobson said. “You knew that when he was with you, he was loving every minute of it, committed to every minute of it and loving where he was.”
“Although he was extremely busy, active and sought after, and involved in a tremendous amount of organizations and clubs, when you were lucky enough to snag time with him, you were his entire focus,” Mimi Roberts said. “He blocked out everything and you were his world.”
Thank you for this lovely article/tribute to Sandy. A heartbreaking tragedy and he so deserves for all to know him better, and to never be forgotten…God Bless Sandy and his family.

All the latest USC news and information can now be carried around in a purse or pants pocket.
The recently launched USCmobile program allows smartphone users to access USC news and information on a streamlined web browsing program designed specifically for mobile phones.
Members of the USC community can visit mobile.usc.edu to view the mobile site and can add the program to a phone’s home screen or bookmark it. USCmobile differs from the regular USC website in that its format is made especially to be read on a smaller screen. Unlike some other mobile applications where someone must scroll up and down to see content, USCmobile is formatted in an easy-to-read layout with simple navigation.
“In the coming years, mobile communication is going to be a really important area,” said Kevin Durkin, director of communications for USC’s Information and Technology Services. “We want to optimize access by smartphones so people at USC can reach their target audience. We feel this is a very important first step.”
Developers at ITS began working on USCmobile because of the increasing use of smartphones, including iPhones, Droids and BlackBerries, around campus.
ITS started working on this program in fall 2009. Initially, the department hoped just to make existing versions of USC web content more accessible, but then decided to create a whole new mobile website instead.
The site lets users access the full student directory, USC maps that are searchable by category or building name, and an arts and events calendar. In addition, the Track a Tram feature shows the location of USC trams in real time, and the USC News, USC Reader, USC Twitter and Daily Trojan tabs display the latest and most popular posts.
Students were particularly drawn to the Track a Tram capability.
“USCmobile is an efficient way to get information fast,” said Ashley Harlow, a sophomore majoring in sociology and social science. “I especially like the Track a Tram feature. It saves me a lot of time.”
The website also features a feedback button, which enables USCmobile users to send questions, comments and suggestions to ITS developers.
“We want people to tell us what they want to see next or ways to improve what’s already up there,” Durkin said. “If we get feedback, we’ll be able to make it so it’s exactly what students are asking for.”
Some USCmobile users have already offered their suggestions on how to enhance the program.
“Athletic information, like scores and schedules, could be easier to get to,” said Ariana Case, a freshman majoring in communication.
Some students, however, didn’t see much use for the program.
“I don’t have a smartphone, but even if I did I don’t think this would be something necessary to use,” said Park Desloge, an undeclared freshman.

USC’s Interactive Media Division, a branch of the School of Cinematic Arts that offers programs in participative media and entertainment, was recently named the top school in the nation for game design studies.

The Princeton Review, the test-prep company known for its “best schools” lists, released its rankings of the top game design programs this week, placing USC at the top.
USC’s Interactive Media Division began in 2002 as a Master of Fine Arts program, offering a degree in interactive media.
Since its inception, the IMD has expanded to include a Bachelor of Arts program in interactive entertainment, as well as an interdivisional Ph.D. program in media arts and practice.
Tracy Fullerton, holder of the Electronic Arts Endowed Chair of Interactive Entertainment, said the program started with a strong vision.
“[School of Cinematic Arts Dean] Elizabeth Daley held a vision about how the program would move forward with game design, participative media and digital arts, and how these components would be united under a history of storytelling,” Fullerton said.
The interactive entertainment program emphasizes creating thoughtful, collaborative leaders focused on imaginative, interactive properties for digital entertainment.
“It’s focused on what the user experiences — what the player is thinking and feeling,” Fullerton said.
The program, she said, “takes gaming beyond a technical form to an art form.”
Fullerton also said keeping pace with changes in the gaming industry is another part of the IMD’s advantage.
“Students are exposed to unreleased, cutting-edge tools and technology,” she said, noting that she currently holds a class that is working with gestural systems, such as Microsoft Surface, the first-ever surface computer.
Sean Bouchard, a graduate student studying interactive media, said IMD’s focus on design is what sets USC’s program apart.
“There’s a development process, and there’s programming, and there’s art, but what differentiates us from other programs — like DigiPen [Institute of Technology, which was ranked No. 2] — is that we’re really about learning how to design a game and learning about what makes a game fun, what makes it interesting,” he said.
Kyla Gorman, a graduate student studying interactive media, said the program stresses the importance of understanding the experience of participating in a video game. Students also explore the theoretical aspect of game design by creating and experimenting with actual games.
“We focus on the design, because it’s such a new field that there’s no real theoretical grounding for it yet,” Gorman said. “We look at what is fun and what makes a game balanced. You have to have the experience of actually playing a game to know how it’s working.”
The Princeton Review surveyed 500 schools to create its top-50 list, evaluating the programs based on such criteria as academics, faculty, technology and game laboratories and career placement. Fullerton said earning the first position is a great honor.
“We worked really hard to establish game design as a rigorous academic study. To be recognized, and furthermore, to be recognized by the Princeton Review, which is pretty much the gold standard for helping parents and prospective students understand the programs they’re looking at, is a really exciting moment — not just for us, but for the field of game design,” she said.

The Greek community has a noticeably large presence in Undergraduate Student Government — the result, many say, of strong organization.
Of the four USG presidential tickets this year, two — Dylan Dann and Addison McCaleb and winners Chris Cheng and Nehi Ogbevoen — have ties to the Greek community. Combined, they captured 77 percent of the presidential vote, though only 22 percent of the study body is Greek.
This is not a coincidence — more than 55 percent of the Greek community voted in the election, accounting for 43 percent of the total votes.
Though none of the Greek councils are allowed to endorse candidates, Interfraternity Council President Eric Ronan, who oversees 1,990 males in 23 fraternities, said the two Greek-affiliated tickets made their platforms accessible to the most students.
“Both tickets did a great job of coming up with a clear and concise message that resonated with the USC undergraduate student population,” he said.
USG defines Greek voters as active members of USC-chartered fraternities or sororities belonging to the IFC, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council, Panhellenic or Asian Greek Council. Non-Greek students are considered to be residential if they live in the 90007 or 90089 zip codes, and commuters if they do not.
Of the 4,684 votes cast in the presidential race, 49 percent came from residential voters, 43 percent from Greeks and 8 percent from commuters. USC Student Affairs calculates the current student body composition as 37 percent residential, 22 percent Greek and 40 percent commuter.
A factor in the large Greek turnout, some say, might be the system’s organizational structure, which allows candidates to quickly address groups of 200 people by attending house meetings.
President-elect Cheng said he tried to attend as many Monday night dinners as possible at the various fraternities and sororities.
“We met the large houses but also the small ones,” he said. “It took a lot of hustle and effort, but a lot of them really appreciated it and it showed in the results.”
Parker Adams, IFC’s vice president for public relations, said the large Greek turnout shows the community’s investment in the future of the university.
Adams also said the sense of community in the Greek system gives Greek candidates an advantage over other candidates.
“When you’re in need of the support of people from that network, they are able and willing to give it,” he said. “There’s nothing in the USC residential community quite like that other than shaking hands and kissing babies on Trousdale.”
Ronan said students in IFC fraternities are not voting for other IFC Greek males because they are told to or believe they need to, but rather out of a sense of having a better understanding and appreciation for a member of their own community.
“Not to say IFC Greek males don’t understand nor appreciate non-IFC members, but rather it is an issue of familiarity,” Ronan said. “Its just like when a democrat decides to vote for another democrat.”
Janice Kim, a sophomore majoring in communication, said, although she voted because one of the candidates came to her residence at Webb Tower and encouraged students to vote, others probably voted based on their group affiliations.
“A lot of students organizations like Greeks have issues they really care about, and they make sure they are heard by motivating members to vote,” she said.
Tommy Sander, a sophomore majoring in architecture, said the overall voter turnout reflects the underexposure of student government.
“I don’t see any of the changes student government produces, if any, so for me to even care about elections about someone who to me really doesn’t do much isn’t happening,” he said. “They get votes from where they get exposure.”
Sander said the high Greek participation highlights the fact that it is an organized system that can vote more as a unit.
Alex Schaff, a junior majoring in biology and economics and a member of an IFC fraternity, which he preferred not to disclose, said word-of-mouth about candidates travels faster in the small Greek community than in the larger university community.
“I just voted because I’m a Greek, a friend told me about a [candidate], and I wanted the Greek guy to win because I saw he had a lot of the same interests as me,” he said.

Rachelle Dondrea, a freshman majoring in psychology, found herself struggling to pay for school when her Navy ROTC scholarship fell through. She hurried to submit her financial aid documents on time and ultimately had to take out a number of loans to pay her tuition.
But what Dondrea did not know is that the Financial Aid Office has a process for considering students’ extenuating circumstances.
“I didn’t know about it,” Dondrea said. “I was already a semester late paying for previous tuition. I had to rush and didn’t think I had time.”
Most of the students who were scrambling Tuesday night to file their financial aid forms will be given an aid package in July and not think about it again. But a few will find themselves back in the Financial Aid Office, appealing for more money because of changes to their families’ financial situations.
Though USC says it doesn’t set aside any money for students who unexpectedly need it, Guy Hunter, assistant dean of Financial Aid, said students who find themselves in trouble should file appeals with the financial aid office because  they could get more money.
“They’d have to submit documentation, like a loss of employment letter,” Hunter said. “Then we’d re-evaluate their financial aid. If we find that a student’s need increases, we would fund that student.”
This year, Hunter said, many students were faced with sudden changes to their financial circumstances, largely because of the economic downturn and a major increase in job losses. He said the number of financial aid appeals filed this year nearly tripled from last year, from 500 to approximately 1,500.
Appeals are considered by a committee and based on a standardized system. They are also dependant on the amount of money left to give. Though not all appeals come to fruition, Hunter said it is to a student’s advantage to apply and talk with a counselor.
“My guess is anything greater than a $3,000 difference would generate a change [in financial aid],” he said. “But it’s not a dollar-for-dollar thing. If they feel their situation has changed, we encourage students to submit an appeal.”
But some students, like Dondrea, are not aware of this opportunity.
Dondrea said, after she did not get the aid she needed, she went to the Financial Aid Office to ask what she could do. The only advice she got, however, was to apply for loans.
“I had to rush [FAFSA] and didn’t do the CSS Profile. My parents had to take private loans but were already denied because of poor credit scores,” Dondrea said.
Dondrea’s parents ended up qualifying for a Parent PLUS loan, which requires a less in-depth background check. She was then awarded $13,000 in university grants and aid but continues to struggle to find ways to pay off her accumulating debt.
“I do feel they could have done something more for me,” Dondrea said.
USC Financial Aid officials said they do what they can while being fair to all the students who are able to apply for financial aid on time.
Hunter said the amount of aid given to students who ask for more financial aid after the deadline depends mostly on how much funding is available after financial aid packages are given out.
“There’s not money we set aside; it’s really based on availability of funds,” Hunter said. “We disburse it to students who apply on time, so when there’s no money their funding might be different.”

After a meeting with student leaders, USC Transportation is considering working with Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority to offer students subsidized monthly passes.
On the town · USC Transportation and Metro are planning to survey student interest in the I-TAP program, which would allow students to purchase subsidized passes. - Andrew Chia | Daily Trojan 
Fed up with complications with the Metro student pass program, the presidents of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate and the Undergraduate Student Government met with transportation officials from Metro, USC and UCLA to discuss potential changes to the system.
Currently, full-time USC students can buy monthly passes directly from Metro under their college/vocational pass program. The program allows students to use Metro transportation with a monthly pass.
But the process of obtaining a pass involves an abundance of paperwork, which often takes three weeks to complete, and sometimes students get no response.
USG President Holden Slusher said his main concern is streamlining the application process.
GPSS President Johannes Schmitt said the program can be problematic for graduate students who sometimes don’t qualify for a pass.
Metro defines full-time enrollment as a course load of 12 units or more, but this differs from USC’s criteria for graduate students.
“Full-time status for most grad students is 6 units — so many students aren’t even eligible for passes,” Schmitt said.
Schmitt said he thinks USC should collaborate with Metro on a semester pass program, citing UCLA’s program as an example.
“UCLA has a subsidized program — students can pay $50 for a term pass at the UCLA Transportation Office,” he said. “Nothing like that exists at USC — you have to work directly with Metro.”
The two presidents voiced these concerns Friday at a meeting with David Sutton, director of Metro Commute Services; Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation; and David J. Karwaski of UCLA Transportation.
Karwaski presented a slideshow detailing UCLA’s Metro pass system. Sutton suggested adopting the Institutional Transit Access Pass (I-TAP) program, which provides students with a specially priced Metro pass at a subsidized rate determined after discussion between Metro and the institution.
Those at the meeting agreed that GPSS and USC Transportation would work to determine possible demand for the I-TAP program. If a survey of graduate students shows significant interest (anything over 10 percent of grad students, Schmitt suggests), they will initiate a pilot program for students, possibly before the end of the school year.
“Metro’s going to send us a questionnaire within a week that they would like answers to,” Mazza said. “GPSS will try to get it out to the grad students before spring break.”
Adopting the I-TAP system would effectively solve the pass application problems, Mazza noted, letting USC determine students’ eligibility.
“We would be the gatekeeper when it came to students,” he said.
Reaction from graduate students was mixed.
“Maybe they should try it with undergraduates first — because they are more likely to be hanging out and to be looking for a cheaper form of transportation. A lot of grad students might not use buses that often,” said Hendrik Makaliwe, a Ph.D. student studying computer science.
However, Pushkar Dixit and Archana Gopikumar, both first-year graduate students in electrical engineering, stated they often travel downtown and around the L.A. Metro area. Both regularly spend $30-40 each semester on Metro, and would use Metro more often if there was a semester pass option, such as I-TAP.
Schmitt and Slusher are optimistic about the process, and believe that USC student ridership on Metro may go up as a result.
“Once we have the Expo Line with a stop at Trousdale and a streamlined system where they buy a ticket for a semester and USC pays the difference for the cost of that, I think many students would do that,” Schmitt said.
But before anything happens, officials must decide where the money to subsidize will come from.
“We don’t know how many students want the card — we don’t know how much we can support a subsidy if thousands of students want the card,” Mazza said.
One option for funding is a new student fee, which would have to be approved both by the student body and the administration. Students, however, were wary of that solution.
“It would be unfair for those that didn’t use Metro,” said Michael Ghassemlou, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention.
Mazza is taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the process.
“Our hope is that before the end of this academic year we might have some hard numbers to present to Student Affairs and senior administrators. Hypothetically speaking, we might have something in place [for undergraduates] by next fall,” he said.
Please, let this come to something!  For those of us that commute (which is most grad students, who are taking less than 12 credits), Metro is significantly more expensive than driving.  I don’t want to drive, I want to be one less car on the road creating traffic, but when it costs 2x as much to take the bus as to drive, what am I to do?  Hurry up and get the survey out there, GPSS!  I want to give you my support!

Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said he believes one of the best ways to prevent crime is to join forces, and on Thursday night he will give students and community members a chance to do just that.

As part of USC’s Community Conversation Series, Beck will participate in a panel discussion with representatives from USC’s Department of Public Safety, the Undergraduate Student Government and the Neighborhood Council, among others.
“Collaborative efforts between the various stakeholders in public safety make the biggest difference,” Beck said.
Crime in the USC area has not been particularly problematic since Beck took the helm of LAPD in November. Still, Beck said, even if crime isn’t making headlines, it is still an important issue.
“Even if crime’s down, it doesn’t matter if you’re the victim,” Beck said.
The panel will hear student and community concerns and help find solutions. Beck said he thinks it is an important discussion for students to attend, even though crime is down right now.
“I think people can feel a little bit better about where they’re going to school, but I don’t think that changes the fact that they have to be aware of the area,” Beck said.
The event aims to bring community members, students and law enforcement officials together to discuss safety and crime concerns.
“The main thing is we want folks to work together, so it’s not groups pitted against each other,” said David Roberts, USC’s associate director for local government relations.
The event, put on by USC’s Office of Government and Community Relations, will begin with an address by Beck and will continue with a panel discussion. The panel will also feature Jan DeAndrade, neighborhood prosecutor for the city attorney’s office; DPS Chief Carey Drayton; Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Denzil Suite; North Area Neighborhood Development Council President Shawn Simons; and Helen Moser, director of Campus Affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government.
Panelists said they expect the prime concerns among community members to be late-night parties and noise issues; they expect students will be concerned about safety after dark, property crimes and bike safety.
All of these issues, panelists said, can be fixed by instilling a sense of shared responsibility.
“Safety is about community,” Simons said. “If the students aren’t considerate of the community and knowing that there are people who have children and go to school and go to work and work night shifts and day shifts, then it doesn’t bode well for a tight community.”
Beck said it is critical that students keep in mind the nature of the community both to create a more cooperative environment and a safer environment.
“Many students come from very, very far away or very, very different cultures from what South Los Angeles has to offer,” Beck said. “I think a lot of it is understanding the variables that come from where you live.”
Simons noted that the key is for the community to work with the university and students not to impose rules or regulations that will intimidate students.
“We have to be careful not to overstep the bounds to make people feel afraid,” she said. “That’s alienating and that sets up walls and makes things more difficult.”
Collaboration and understanding, Beck said, could also help solve bike safety issues.
Bike safety has been a hot-button topic in all of Los Angeles lately because of a growing demand for protection of bikers’ rights. Beck said it is important, especially given the large number of bicyclists around USC, for bikers and drivers to be attuned to the dangers of the road.
“A lot of it is being aware of your vulnerability when you’re using a bike to commute,” Beck said. “On the other side of it, it is for the students that drive or anybody else that drives in the ’SC area to have an awareness of bicycles. People forget just how vulnerable bicyclists are.”
Beyond bike safety, Moser said students are also concerned about the extent of DPS’ boundaries and hopes to discuss this issue at the forum.
“Some students have expressed concern that boundaries don’t include west of campus, and those boundaries are set by LAPD,” Moser said.
She said she is excited for the chance to discuss this and other issues with all these groups together.
“This is a rare opportunity where we’re going to get both LAPD and DPS in the same room,” Moser said.
The panel discussion will be held at 5:30 p.m. in the Founder’s Room at the Galen Center. Roberts is hoping to see a good cross section of students and community members.
“It is the university’s interest not only to have the environment safe for our students, faculty and staff but we want to see the kids going to school, the residents and the businesses in a safer environment,” Roberts said.
