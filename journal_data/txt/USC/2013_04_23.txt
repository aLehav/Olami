Representatives of the newly reinstated sorority Alpha Gamma Delta have begun recruiting following the Panhellenic Council’s February decision to invite the sorority to reclaim its place on The Row after a 30-year period of dormancy.
National Alpha Gamma Delta Assistant Director of Fraternity Services Annie Raeder said Alpha Gamma Delta made the decision to close their chapter at USC in the mid-’80s because of low membership.

“We simply had a smaller group than most chapters at the time and were unable to give the experience that we wanted,” Raeder said. “We closed the chapter until a time where we can come back and provide a positive and enriching Alpha Gamma Delta experience.”
With a vote of 6 to 4, the Panhellenic Council elected to bring the sorority back on campus. The vote came after Alpha Gamma Delta reapplied and presented  information about their sorority.
The house is currently used for meetings of the business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, as well as some Sigma Delta Tau events.
PHC President Megan Lambert said the new sorority will bolster Greek life on campus.
“More and more girls are going to recruitment,” Lambert said. “We have some of the biggest chapters on the West Coast. There are a couple of houses with 230 to 250 members, which is too big. We felt a new sorority might alleviate some of those numbers.”
Though Alpha Gamma Delta will be officially established on The Row next fall, formal recruitment for the new chapter will not occur until 2014 in order to give smaller sororities a chance to reach capacity next fall. There are currently 11 sororities on The Row.
Many current sorority members had positive reactions to the news of Alpha Gamma Delta’s return. Megan Schutzler, a member of Alpha Delta Pi, echoed Lambert’s sentiments about the growing number of sorority members.
“I think a new sorority is a great way to accommodate the increasing number of girls going through rush each year,” Schutzler said.
Raeder said girls associated with the sorority at other schools are excited for the return of the chapter.
“We jumped at the opportunity to be at such a prestigious academic institution because we have such a great history at USC and our alumnae have been dying for the chapter to come back for years,” Raeder said.
Originally established at the university in 1928, Alpha Gamma Delta had ties to draw on as they began the process of reintroduction.
“They had been at USC before so they had almunae here to help them; they had a lot of local support,” Lambert said.
Raeder also stressed the influence of the alumnae in bringing the chapter back to the university.
“It’s great that we do have that prior history here and those alumnae that have been involved on campus and in the community who are ready to support the group upon its return,” Raeder said.
Raeder said renovations on the new house has already begun in preparation for new sorority members.
“Planning is underway to make the house beautiful, so that it is a beautiful thing for our new members to have and to hold events in once it’s all ready,” Raeder said.
Raeder said additional research was done to ensure Alpha Gamma Delta would be able to incorporate the unique aspects of Greek life at the university.
“We’re learning everything that goes into the traditions of the Greek community at USC. … Learning all the ins and outs of the culture so that once we’re on campus, we can really help the women integrate into the community,” Raeder said.
Though Alpha Gamma Delta will be newly instated on The Row, Raeder said the sorority is looking forward to create new traditions.
“Since we’re new, we’ll establish our own traditions and our own exciting events. … We want to be able to prepare our chapter to be a great group of women that have great traditions that fit in with the community,” Raeder said.
Raeder said the sorority will be focused on service-learning as well as supporting one another.
“We really pride ourselves on being an organization where our members live with purpose, which is the concept of really using the values in our purpose to try and be the best version of yourself,” Raeder said, “whether that is to get involved and be a leader on campus or to participate in community service events or to just be there for your friends and for your sisters.”
Some people, however, are concerned by the addition of a new sorority because it might add additional competition during the rush period.
“I’m a little nervous about it since a few Panhellenic sororities already have continuous open bidding and don’t have a large enough membership to support having houses on The Row, the introduction of an additional sorority hinders the growth of existing sororities,” said Megan Doyle, a freshman with Greek affiliation majoring in communication
In the meantime, Raeder said Alpha Gamma Delta will hold their own rush to get women acquainted with the new sorority and establish a foundation of potential new members in preparation for formal rush in fall 2014.
“We will host our own set of events for women to get together and get to know each other and learn about Alpha Gamma Delta,” Raeder said. “We’ll really be looking for women who share those same values, that really want to make a difference and that already are a big part of the Trojan Family in an exciting way.”
The house closed at the end of fall semester 1986, so it’s not quite 30 years yet. Please don’t age me that much. ;)
Sorority life is supposed to be fun and rewarding.  Why DG makes it so dour and competitive I will never understand.  maybe they take themselves too seriously?  I mean really, our Row will be better with the AGD’s back!  Welcome back ladies.
It’s not quite 30 years yet.   Look out DG, you are going down!  You’ll regret that “no” vote!

Natalie Klein, co-chair of the advisory board for Classical KDFC Radio, and her husband, USC Trustee Ken Klein, donated $1 million on Tuesday to Classical KDFC Radio, the university-owned radio station serving the Bay Area.
This was the largest donation to USC Radio its 66-year history. The donation was part of the station’s endowment for the “For the Music” campaign.
USC Radio, which also owns Classical KUSC in Los Angeles, purchased KDFC in 2011. KDFC and KUSC are two of the largest and most popular public radio and nonprofit classical music stations in the United States, according to a KDFC San Francisco Classical news release.
USC Radio’s goal is to reach $10 million in capital investments in order to build a permanent home. KDFC hopes to raise $7.5 million for startup and operating funds and $1.5 million for expansion efforts. The Kleins’ $1 million donation covers 100 percent of the proposed amount for its future endowment.
Ken Klein has served on the USC Board of Trustees since 2009 and graduated from USC in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and biomedical engineering. He said USC’s support for Classical KDFC Radio can in turn support future Trojans and alumni and that he has also had a long-held interest in music and the arts.
“I see the preservation of this station as linking what the university is doing with the arts to the needs of the Bay Area community, which is a very important community to USC in terms of incoming students and alumni,” Klein said. “With its six arts schools and its incredible support of world-class classical music, USC and KDFC share a common love of the arts.”
President C. L. Max Nikias said the Kleins’ donation significantly impacts campaign efforts.
“Natalie and Ken Klein stand among USC’s most dedicated supporters, and their commitment to classical radio is evidenced by their extraordinary generosity,” Nikias said in a statement. “Their exceptional gift will do so much to bring classical music to listeners throughout our state.”
This was not the Kleins’ first contribution to the school. In 2006, they founded USC’s Klein Institute for Undergraduate Engineering Life. This institute is focused on preparing students with collaboration and service skills for their future careers.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephen A. Marcus ordered  Tuesday a delay of the trials of the two men charged in last year’s killings of two USC graduate students, media reported.
Bryan Barnes, 20, and Javier Bolden, 19, have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the fatal shooting and robbery of Chinese graduate engineering students Ming Qu and Ying Wu on April 11, 2012.
Qu and Wu, both 23 years old, were killed in a car in an off-campus shooting west of the University Park Campus near the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue.
A wrongful death lawsuit was filed against the university in May by Qu’s and Wu’s parents seeking unspecified damages, claiming that the university misled people about the safety of the area surrounding the University Park Campus. However, Superior Court Judge Michael Johnson dismissed the case in February, citing insufficient legal arguments.
Barnes and Bolden were charged last May in connection with the case. Both pled not guilty at their arraignment in July.
I read a lot of articles about homicides, and beatings and one thing almost all of them have in common these days compared to about 15 years or more ago are the suspects/ arrested individuals are all in there 20’s or under, usually 17-20 age group. Teenagers are lacking social respect for others as well as life, something a normal family would have ingrained into them if it wasn’t for breakdown of the American Family Structure and lack of parenting skills. I see this trend increasing, and its a shame!!

Undergraduate Student Government passed a resolution Tuesday calling for the formation of a student-run Campus Smoking Policy Committee to investigate alternatives to the current campus smoking policy.
Burning issue · The majority of students support a smoke-free campus, prompting Undergraduate Student Government to create a committee. — Photo illustration by Ralf Cheung
The committee will look at the possibility of banning smoking on campus altogether. The decision to create a committee came a day after UCLA instated a campuswide ban on smoking.
According to a recent survey conducted by Undergraduate Student Government, 54 percent of undergraduates support the enforcement of a smoke-free campus, whereas 27 percent of students desire designated smoking areas. The remaining 17 percent of undergraduates indicated that they are content with the policy currently in place, which includes smoking designated areas.
The Campus Smoking Policy Committee will be composed of Graduate Student Government President Melody Shekari, USG Greek Senator Logan Heley, GSG Director of Campus Affairs Janna Bernstein, USG President Christian Kurth, Senior Associate Dean of Students Patrick Bailey, USG Director of Wellness Affairs Alexander Pinto, Director of the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion Paula Swinford and the  incoming vice president for Student Affairs.
The resolution was authored by Pinto and outgoing USG Vice President Vinnie Prasad. Prasad said that the committee was created in response to a lack of strictness in the current smoking policy.
“The current campus smoking policy is loosely defined, poorly enforced and unknown to most students on campus,” Prasad said. “Students have voiced that smoking on campus is a big issue and we want to find a policy that effectively outlines the administration’s expectations about smoking on campus.”
The current policy encourages designated outdoor smoking spaces. The policy specifies that these spaces “should be located far enough away from doorways, windows and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from entering enclosed buildings.”
However, Pinto said this policy has been largely ineffective. Smoking within 20 feet of entryways and windows of public buildings has been prohibited in the state of California since 2004, but this rule has not been enforced by the USC policy. Some saw the  ambiguity of the policy, and the lack of enforcement, often renders the rule ineffective.
“The main issue is students’ smoking near buildings, which is illegal by California state law and unfortunately, not enforced on campus,” Pinto said. “The current USC policy states that students must smoke ‘far enough’ away from a building, which is unacceptable because it does not state a distance and often results in unrestricted smoking.”
All University of California institutions will become smoke-free campuses by 2014. USC senators said this new policy encouraged them to push for more smoking regulations on the USC campus in order to align with other universities.
Though the resolution does not strictly call for a smoke-free campus, the Campus Smoking Policy Committee will propose new policies to potentially be implemented in the following academic year. Prasad said the committee will have until Nov. 1, to present a proposal for a new campus smoking policy to the USG Senate.
USG student leaders said they will work with administrators on the committee to investigate what new policies should be enacted on campus.
Heley, who sponsored the resolution, said that he believes students have the right to decide what smoking policies should be applied on campus.
“It’s clear students want our campus smoking policy changed,” Heley said. “I feel if students don’t want to smell smoke when they’re on campus then we should have a policy that allows them to make that choice.”
Whether the policy is changed or not, Prasad said he is confident that the newly formed committee will be better able to channel the voice of the student body into effective action.
“Ultimately, I believe that the committee will come up with a better smoking policy than the one we currently have, whether that is a smoke-free campus or something else,” Prasad said. “This committee can fully explore all options and alternatives from multiple perspectives and come up with the best solution.”
I am a longtime Republican Conservative and a Business owner. I do not like Government over reach but I DO support smoking bans since this is an issue that affects people who choose not to smoke.  In addition, total Campus Smoking Bans are a good thing to implement since tobacco has no place in an Institution where today’s best are being prepared to be tomorrow’s leaders.
It is truly amazing how stupid some people are.  Who ever is dumb enough to truly believe this government propaganda that second hand cigarette smoke causes health problems deserves to die from lung cancer.  News flash nicotine does not cause cancer.  Tar in cigarettes has been associated with cancer.  There are more carcinogens in whole milk then second hand smoke.  Perhaps we should ban milk from all campuses. Isn’t that a good idea after all milk contains Genetically-engineered bovine growth hormone (rBGH) which increases cancer risks. Lactose intolerance, Heart Disease, Harmful Bacteria, and Weight Gain have all been scientifically linked to drinking milk.  Insulin-dependent (type 1 or childhood-onset) diabetes is linked to consumption of dairy products.  In fact the list goes on and on literally not to mention if you inhale milk you will certainly die of asphyxiation.  When will our government act in our best interest and make drinking milk illegal for own protection so that stupid people can justify trampling on the rights of others and being rude and smug.
APZ
Can you provide references to any publications in substantial, refereed journals consistent with your milk claims? I seems a bit absurd and irresponsible to minimize smoking/second hand smoke as a cause of lung cancer given a plethora of supporting studies. 
Do you not accept the work product of the scientific, medical and public health communities in general in favor of government conspiracy notions?
Can we at least have a dedicated 420 area?
Finally someone said it!
UCLA banned it. Even more the reason to not ban it.
We’re all adults here. Banning smoking on campus entirely is absurd if you ask me. However, what are the policies on vaping and e-cigarettes? Are these allowed to be used inside buildings?
Mike and Alex,
A number of communities (Of adults) have baned smoking. Great idea. Long overdue. Second hand smoke can be as offensive and hazardous outdoors as in. The issue is not “smell” which trivializes the health risk. There is no benefit to anyone, except tobacco companies and retailers, for smoking. Banning smoking on campus is an intelligent an sophisticated response. The 20 foot rule is not workable–smoke won’t abide by it even in light wind and does nothing to encourage the smoker toward more healthy behavior choices..
USC doesn’t need to baby it’s students, they should work harder to enforce the 20 foot rule, but banning smoking on campus entirely is ridiculous.  Just because you don’t like the smell of smoke on campus doesn’t give you the right to force everyone else not to smoke.
I can’t stand cigarettes, I grew up in a house where both my parents were heavy smokers & my father currently has lung cancer & still smokes. Having said that I think if you’re outside and not bothering anyone else you should be allowed to smoke. We’re all adults at USC. Right?

The No. 1-ranked USC women’s golf team will take a commanding 11-stroke lead into Wednesday’s final round at the Pac-12 championships, erasing any doubts that might have surfaced after a disappointing fifth-place finish at last week’s PING/ASU Invitational.
The Women of Troy came out on fire in Monday’s opening round, placing five players in the top 10 and immediately distancing themselves from the competition. Junior Sophia Popov led the squad with a first round 6-under 66, a career best. Her round included an eagle on Valencia Country Club’s par-5 ninth hole. Freshman Annie Park shot an impressive 2-under 70 on the day while sophomore Doris Chen and junior Rachel Morris tied at even par.
Popov slowed down during Tuesday’s second round, but her combined two-day 3-under is just one stroke behind the leaders. The junior is looking for a USC-record sixth career individual win. Park’s second consecutive round of 70 tied her with Stanford’s Mariah Stackhouse for the two-round lead at 4-under. Chen’s 1-under 71 on Tuesday moved her to just three strokes back of the lead, putting her within striking distance for an individual title as well.
Barring an epic collapse, the team title appears to be solidly in USC’s hands. No. 8 UCLA currently holds a one-stroke advantage over No. 14 Washington for second place, while No. 6 Arizona and Arizona State round out the top five.
The individual race, on the other hand, is more compelling. Park, Stackhouse, Popov, Chen and Colorado’s Jennifer Coleman all have a solid chance at victory. Only three strokes separate the tournament’s top-eight players, setting up an exciting final round.
If Park can hold on for the win, she would become the third consecutive USC freshman to win the event, following in the footsteps of Popov in 2011 and Chen in 2012. The final round can be followed on GolfStat.com.

After helping the USC women’s tennis team topple rival UCLA with a 6-1 victory in the regular season finale on April 18, junior Kaitlyn Christian became the seventh Woman of Troy to be named Pac-12 player of the week this season.
In the match, Christian started the day off against the formerly No. 7 Bruins with an 8-3 doubles win alongside sophomore Sabrina Santamaria over UCLA’s Pamela Montez and Skylar Morton.
Strong finish · In USC’s regular-season finale against UCLA, Christian won both her singles and doubles matches despite battling the flu. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In singles play, Christian dropped her first set and fell behind 2-0 in the second set but rallied back and defeated No. 90 Kaitlyn Ray with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback victory despite battling the stomach flu.
The win was Christian’s eighth straight and improved her singles record to 21-6 overall and a perfect 8-0 in conference play. She has done the bulk of her damage from court five, where she is 6-0 in singles.
Christian and Santamaria, ranked No. 2 in the nation in doubles, finished the season undefeated with a 13-0 record, all from court one. In the upcoming Pac-12 championships, the two look to defend their 2012 doubles title.
The No. 5-ranked Women of Troy concluded the regular season 21-2 overall and 9-0 in the Pac-12. USC clinched the Pac-12 team title with the victory over UCLA, and the win marked the first time that USC took back-to-back wins over UCLA since 2006.
Christian joins senior Danielle Lao, sophomores Gabriella DeSimone, Giuliana Olmos, Zoë Scandalis and Santamaria, and freshman Ellie Yates as Women of Troy who have been named Pac-12 players of the week this season.
With the regular season finished and a 13-game win streak in place, the Women of Troy now shift their focus to individual play at the Pac-12 championships, which begin on Thursday and conclude on Sunday in Ojai, Calif.

The last few weeks brought a merciful end to a tumultuous period for both the men’s and women’s basketball teams.
After the dismissal of former men’s head coach Kevin O’Neill and the resignation of women’s coach Michael Cooper, Athletic Director Pat Haden was hard at work, bringing in Florida Gulf Coast University’s Andy Enfield to lead the Trojans and USC great Cynthia Cooper-Dyke to oversee the Women of Troy.
Now that the dust has settled, it’s time to start thinking about the future. Neither team is going to be picked to win the Pac-12 conference in 2013-14. Really, an NCAA tournament appearance for either coach would be quite the accomplishment.
Still, USC basketball fans are going to want to see some results in year one of Enfield and Cooper-Dyke. This begs the question: Which team is better equipped for success next season — the men or women?
From a talent standpoint, the Women of Troy are the clear winners.
Next season, senior forward Cassie Harberts returns as the star of the team after finishing as an All-Pac-12 selection who also led the nation in free-throw attempts.
She scored at least 10 points in every game except for one this season. It’s not unreasonable to think she’ll compete for           Pac-12 player of the year and attract attention on the national stage.
Harberts alone is enough to separate the Women of Troy from their male counterparts, assuming the Trojans don’t land a top-ranked recruit and senior guard J.T. Terrell doesn’t morph into a future pro. Both of those possibilities are highly unlikely at best.
Generally speaking, there’s just more for Cynthia-Cooper to work with. Junior guard Ariya Crook came off the bench for most of her sophomore campaign and still finished with 13.4 points per game. She figures to put up similar numbers again.
Shooting guard Jordan Adams was the No. 7-ranked recruit in the class of 2012 according to ESPN and will be counted on for a much-expanded role next season. Freshman Brianna Barrett was another top-100 prospect from that class who gives USC some depth at the point guard position. Senior Kate Oliver returns, as do two juniors who made significant contributions last season — Kiki Alofaituli and Alexyz Vaioletama.
The Women of Troy will have to absorb the loss of the outgoing Christina Marinacci, who was an aggressive inside presence and a leader. But Marinacci was the only senior on the roster in 2012-13, meaning the core of this squad is coming back. That’s huge.
The Trojans, meanwhile, have more of an uphill challenge to contend with.
Outgoing senior point guard Jio Fontan was far from perfect — in fact, he put up more clunkers than all-around positive performances — but he was the undisputed veteran of an eclectic group of players. Enfield will also be without the services of this season’s most consistent player, forward Eric Wise, along with frontcourt depth provided by Aaron Fuller, James Blasczyk and Renaldo Woolridge. Those are gigantic holes to fill, especially with a recruiting class that remains in flux.
In addition, USC’s backcourt just doesn’t have much going for it other than Terrell and junior swingman Byron Wesley. There are players on the roster who will be able to thrive in Enfield’s high-tempo system, including senior big man Dewayne Dedmon and Terrell. That should make for a far more entertaining team for fans to watch compared to last season, but not necessarily a better one.
In terms of a coaching advantage, it’s just too hard to tell. Enfield had success on the national stage, but in a very small sample size. He does bring in an impressive group of assistants, but their impact is tough to predict.
Cooper-Dyke, meanwhile, has a more sustained track record with a 150-106 mark in eight seasons, though that accomplishment came at three schools even lesser known than Florida Gulf Coast. She also had a so-so performance as head coach of the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, finishing 19-23 in a little less than two seasons.
I think it’s a safe bet that at least one of the two coaching hires will someday make Haden look like a smart man. Problem is, it’s just too early to tell whether that’ll be Enfield or Cooper-Dyke. In the immediate future though, look for the Women of Troy to make more noise in the Pac-12 than Enfield’s squad.
The Trojan men just don’t have the roster in place to be legitimate contenders in the conference yet, but Cooper-Dyke has a star — Harberts — and the talent to bring some excitement to the Galen Center sooner rather than later.

The No. 4-ranked USC women’s sand volleyball team has been selected to participate in the second-annual American Volleyball Coaches Association Collegiate Sand Volleyball National Championship, to be held in Gulf Shores, Ala., from May 3-5.
Title chasing · Junior Brooke Fournier (above) and the Women of Troy will look to win a national championship in Gulf Shores, Ala. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
 
This will be the Women of Troy’s second consecutive appearance in the tournament, making them two for two in their two years of existence as a varsity sport.
The Women of Troy (14-6) are seeded fourth in the tournament and have been ranked fourth in the nation for the majority of the season. Their highest ranking earlier this season was third, but they dropped a spot after narrowly losing to Florida State.
USC will be joining a six-team field that includes all of the top teams in the nation. Defending national champion Pepperdine is set to participate, as is No. 2 seed Long Beach State and No. 3-seeded Florida State. The two teams in the tournament that the Women of Troy have not faced this season are No. 5-seeded North Florida and No. 6-seeded,                        Louisiana-Monroe.
Along with the team tournament, the event will also include a single-elimination, 16-team pairs championship that will feature the top duos in the nation on sand. Both the No. 1-ranked pair, composed of junior Kirby Burnham and graduate student Stevi Robinson, and the No. 2-ranked pair, senior Katie Fuller and freshman Cinnamon Sary, will be representing USC.
USC will begin team play on May 3 against North Florida at 7 a.m. The winner of that match will face undefeated Pepperdine, who has yet to drop a match and is 18-0 this season. Pepperdine also beat the Women of Troy twice earlier in the season.
The Women of Troy’s two pairs teams will begin play in the pairs championship on May 5 at 6 a.m. Portions of both the team and pairs competitions will also be available on the CBS Sports Network.

With the 2013 NFL draft set to begin on Thursday, a group of Trojans are anxiously awaiting the moment when Commissioner Roger Goodell announces their names at Radio City Music Hall and invites them to join one of the most exclusive fraternities around: the National Football League.
Who will it be? · Matt Barkley’s draft stock has fluctuated over the past few months, but the consensus among NFL pundits is he will end up as a first- or second-round draft pick when it’s all said and done. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Quarterback Matt Barkley, one of the most-talked about prospects in this year’s class, is one of those Trojans.
His decision to return to school for his senior year did not bring him the national championship he desired, and along the way Barkley hurt both his shoulder and his draft stock.
Scouts have gone back and forth on whether Barkley will ever be a starting quarterback in the NFL, let alone whether he’ll be successful if placed in the role. Some worry that his arm strength is average and that he lacks athleticism in the pocket.
On the other hand, no quarterback in this year’s class seems as pro-ready as Barkley. He has been schooled in pro-style offenses for the last eight years. Former USC coach and current Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll had this to say about the QB: “He’s thrown every route and read every coverage. … He’s as well-versed as a guy can get.”
Projections about Barkley’s landing spot vary heavily. Some have him going as high as No. 8 to the Buffalo Bills, while others have him going mid-second round to the Arizona Cardinals at pick 38.
Buffalo could be a intriguing landing spot for the 22-year-old. With only the unproven duo of Kevin Kolb and Tarvaris Jackson on the roster at quarterback, Barkley could walk in and instantly be in the running to start.
Moreover, the offense, equipped with tight end Scott Chandler and wide receiver Steve Johnson, would aid Barkley’s transition process. The Bills also sport the impressive backfield duo of Fred Jackson and CJ Spiller to provide legitimate running support.
One of Barkley’s top targets, receiver Robert Woods, will look to break the USC wide receiver curse that has plagued Trojan wideouts of late. Three former USC receivers are on NFL rosters, and none accumulated more than 350 yards last season. Decision-makers in NFL front offices have praised Woods’ route-running ability and believe he is one of the most polished receivers in this class.
However, he lacks the pure speed and strength that many top receivers in the league possess. As a result, Woods is more suited to be a secondary, rather than primary, option. His projections are all over the board; he has been predicted to go as high as the mid-first round and as low as the early third round. One team that has been tied with Woods lately has been the Houston Texans, who seem to be looking for a receiver to complement standout Andre Johnson.
This type of situation seems like it would be a good fit for Woods, as he could learn from one of the all-time greats at the position.
Barkley’s longtime center Khaled Holmes will also be up for grabs this weekend. He has shown that he can move very well for a lineman his size and is extremely coachable. However, he struggles to get low as a result of his 6-foot-4 frame.
Still, any team looking for versatility in the interior of their line has to be intrigued with the possibility of drafting Holmes and adding depth at the center position. If the Bills were to take Barkley early on, they may want to add Holmes to ease the transition to the pros for their prized QB prospect.
Safety T.J. McDonald has a strong pedigree and onfield IQ stemming from his extensive time at USC and his father’s experience in the NFL. McDonald lacks great speed and was often protected by schemes that kept him in the box to utilize his physicality, rather than leaving him floating in pass coverage. Still, his size and natural football intelligence have garnered interest from the New England Patriots and Baltimore Ravens. He could be a fourth- or fifth-round selection.
Standing at a mere 5-foot-8, defensive back Nickell Robey will look to sneak into the late rounds of the draft. He was a tremendous cover corner in college and is an extremely smooth athlete. As the NFL becomes more and more of a passing league, someone who can play nickel corner becomes extremely valuable, especially for teams lacking depth in the secondary. The 49ers might take a look at Robey in the sixth round.
The NFL draft begins on Thursday at 5 p.m. Rounds two and three begin at 3:30 p.m. on Friday, and the final rounds are on Saturday starting at noon. Complete coverage is on ESPN.
Robey lagged it on himself. Hope that 6th round pick was worth it.

Things are starting to get hectic here on campus as the semester begins to wind down. Last-minute assignments and studying for finals are taking up everybody’s time, and it feels like someone is shafting us by stealing hours out of the day when no one’s looking.
In this semester’s coda, most of us are just wishing to go back to a moment when we could lie around and not worry about APA citations. Hopefully this week’s New Noise will be able to help out with that.
We’ve seen before how some artists can take influences from past styles and sounds and incorporate them into their own music. This week’s artists, however, immerse themselves so deep into that influence that they embody that sound completely — these artists sound like the contemporaries of the past.
Black Clouds: “No Reason”
New Jersey rockers Black Clouds have been making a big splash in the DIY world, and rightfully so. The band owns its own studio, books and funds its own tours and has been rocking audiences’ worlds since 2004.
Its latest release, Better Days, was co-produced alongside notable producer John Agnello, best known for working with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Andrew W.K., The Hold Steady and Sonic Youth.
Black Clouds is unique in its grunge-rock style, standing out from other bands that attempt to encapsulate the Northwestern sound of the ’90s. This band truly sounds like Nirvana’s cool cousins from the next suburb over — from the scratchy guitars to the anxious vocals, every song on Better Days is a slice of grunge heaven. Black Clouds is the harder face of grunge, sounding more similar to Bleach-era Nirvana than its later material. From the first growl of the rumbling bass in “No Reason,” it becomes clear that you’re in for a ride back to some seriously better days.

Grant Lyle: “Walk On”
Classic rock always seems to have a timeless quality to it — after all, it’s called “classic” rock for a reason. Toronto’s Grant Lyle has tunes that are built with the same type of archetypal bricks that make up some of the most popular songs in the classic rock realm. His sound is rooted in the canons of blues rock, and he crafts his songs in the vein of Eric Clapton, Duane Allman and Joe Cocker.
His newest release, So There, is a refreshing taste of nostalgia in a contemporary setting, with his blues and classic rock blueprint clearly audible in all of his songs. “Walk On” is a bona fide trip back into the days when solid rock tunes ruled the airwaves and blues guitar vibratos resonated in everyone’s mind.
The track has a distinctive old-school vibe that melded with no-nonsense rock and roll, and the result is a time warp into an era when the longing sounds of blues defined lives for people everywhere.

Generationals: “Put A Light On”
How about some ’80s sounds? New Orleans’ Generationals is an indie-rock band that defines what it is to be a connector of cool. Its music has a diverse set of sounds, and its latest release, Heza, finds the band going in a different direction from its previous release, Astor-Caster (2011).
While that album was full of perfectly crafted pop songs that punched you in the face with optimism, Heza takes a more contemplative tone, instead choosing to take on a more enthralling and almost hypnotizing sound. “Put A Light On” sounds like a proper ’80s avant-garde/prog-rock tune, dripping with overindulgence and excess with every synth note and drum beat.
The song changes gears in the middle and goes on a synth-filled jamming spree, and the carefree vocals and harmonies hark back to days of yore, when things were much easier in spandex and neon.

Mudhoney: “I Like It Small”
Veteran alt-rockers Mudhoney definitely have one of the penthouse suites in the Hotel of Legendary when it comes to grunge. Although the band originally had roots in garage punk, it was the influence of its distorted-guitar madness that helped conceive the beginnings of grunge.
The band has been through a lot in its 25-year career, and its ninth studio album, Vanishing Point, was released earlier this month to positive reviews. The second track on the album, “I Like It Small,” is a raucous in-your-face rock testament that sounds like the B-side to a lost Sex Pistols demo.
The song is absolutely delightful in how authentically punk it sounds, giving ’70s Brit rockers a definite run for their money. Give “I Like It Small” a click, dust off your combats and get ready for some serious stomping.

Hi Rishbha,
This is Dan from the Black Clouds.  Thanks for writing such a great review about our new record!
I was hoping that you could correct two things for us.  We are actually from New Jersey (The Black Clouds from Washington DC are a different band all together and formed last year).  Also, the link on our band name goes to their site as well.  Our url is http://www.theblackclouds.com.  Hopefully they can be fixed.
My brother, Mike Matthews, graduated from USC last year and passed away shortly after so it really means a lot that you chose to write about us.  Thanks again.
-Dan

In 2001, Pixar Animation Studio continued its unprecedented streak of both critically praised and financially successful films with director Pete Docter’s Monsters, Inc.
Freshman-ster · Monsters University follows a young Mike and Sully before they teamed up as the top scaring duo at Monsters, Inc. – Courtesy of Walt Disney Studios
 
The film featured the instantly iconic pairing of Mike Wazowski and James P. “Sulley” Sullivan, played by Billy Crystal and John Goodman. Both characters drew huge laughs, appealed to viewers of all ages and generated large ancillary profits through merchandise.
Thus, the universe of Monsters, Inc. became one the executives at Disney/Pixar and audiences alike desperately wanted to travel back into.
Finally, after 12 years, Pixar’s creative team is set to release a new monsters film: Monsters University, which will have a special advanced screening at the Norris Cinema Theatre on Friday.
Having shown none of Mike and Sulley’s backstory in the original, Pixar tapped director Dan Scanlon and producer Kori Rae to create a prequel.
Scanlon and Rae have both worked at Pixar for over a decade. Scanlon began in 2001 as a storyboard artist. His early work included illustrations for Cars and Toy Story 3. He also co-directed the DVD short film Mater and the Ghostlight with Pixar head John Lasseter, all the while writing and directing his own live-action film, Tracy, in 2009. Monsters University marks his first foray in animation directing.
Rae joined the Pixar family in 1993, beginning her work in the studio’s commercial division. After finding success at each level of production, Rae rose through the ranks, collaborating on such praised projects as Toy Story 2, The Incredibles and Up. With Monsters University, Rae steps into the lead producer’s chair for the first time on a feature-length film.
Scanlon and Rae joined an extensive group of writers from various college newspapers, including the Daily Trojan, to discuss their work on Monsters University. The following Q & A highlights the best of their conversation.
 
Daily Trojan: How did the idea of a prequel for Monsters, Inc. come about?
Scanlon: Well, early on we loved the characters of Mike and Sulley and their relationship and we always wanted to do something with them again. So we kind of got together and talked about what that might be. That’s when we started thinking about how these guys met, which led naturally to the college idea, and we loved the idea of doing something in a university — just the opportunity for sort-of-fun monster antics that could come out of that.
And that led us to the story of Mike and the difficulty when you arrive at college thinking you’re the best of the best but then you come up against some pretty stiff competition. So that was really the germ of the idea and the idea behind doing something that took place before, rather than after.
 
DT: How did you go about presenting a realistic, relatable view of college while staying family-friendly?
Scanlon: What are you talking about? College isn’t family-friendly? We had to be careful about it. The good thing is we were able to get a lot of wild, fun behavior that still reads as fun party college, but is probably no different than the wild, crazy stuff that goes on at an eight-year-old’s birthday party with knocking over tables, eating too much food, smashing things and screaming. So yes, it was a challenge.
 
DT: What was the creative process in crafting the prequel version of the characters?
Scanlon: We had to make them look younger, so our art department did a really good job trying to study how you make an eyeball look younger. And mainly we started to notice that thinning them up really helped. We were all a little thinner in college. We made the characters much thinner and brighter in color. And you know, Sulley is, in my eyes, a top scarer; he’s more muscular and big, so we thinned him up a bit here.
Rae: But it was important that they were recognizable — we had parameters that we wanted to make sure we kept to. We didn’t want to do anything too crazy because they still needed to look like Mike and Sulley and be recognized as Mike and Sulley without a whole lot of changes.
 
DT: What would you like audience members, specifically college students, to take away from this film?
Scanlon: We want it to be a really fun college movie, but we also want to touch something emotionally in people with our films. And we feel like this film is very much about what happens when you come up to a kind of closed door and how you get around that — how you let go of the thing that you think you absolutely have to be to be happy, in order to find out who you truly are.
I think that’s definitely something I experienced in college, that feeling of realizing “This is going to be a lot harder than I thought.”

Disgrace. Prostitute. Sodomite.
These are labels one might hear extremists throw against LGBT individuals in the United States. But in Call Me Kuchu, a documentary following the human rights activism of David Kato, these labels carry even darker undertones for LGBT people in Uganda.
Equality for all · Call Me Kuchu follows the endeavors of David Kato, the first openly gay Ugandan man, and his fellow activists as they struggle to establish basic human rights for LGBT Ugandans.– Courtesy of ACME PR
The film documents a nation deeply at odds with LGBT issues, specifically the politics around the Anti-Homosexuality Bill. This bill advocates life imprisonment (formerly death) for HIV-positive Ugandans engaging in “aggravated homosexuality” and a three-year imprisonment for anyone who fails to turn in a known homosexual within 24 hours of their discovery.
“Kuchu” is a term used by Kato and other members of the Ugandan LGBT community to describe themselves. Derived from the Swahili term “makuchu,” it roughly translates to an equivalent of “queer” except that, for the most part, Ugandans use it as a unifying term, one which draws them together as members of a community rather than identifies them as solitary victims.
Call Me Kuchu begins with an Ugandan religious leader delivering discriminatory propaganda to a manic, applauding crowd. The film then switches to the backyard celebration of a gay Ugandan couple’s ninth anniversary, depicting the duo surrounded by supportive friends.
As these events take place on screen, the distinct cacophony of a printing press can be heard, serving as a juxtaposition of two very different social scenes and symbolizing the media’s influence on Ugandan society.
As the film progresses, the importance of truth in journalism and public perception of freedom of expression move to the film’s forefront. The most novel question that Call Me Kuchu raises isn’t whether the kuchus deserve equality or if the Ugandan evangelicals and government are wrong. Actually, Kato’s fight against Ugandan prejudice is closely tied to the coverage of the Ugandan LGBT community by Rolling Stone, a weekly tabloid published in Kampala, Uganda.
For those reading this article  —and anyone who reads any sort of news publication, for that matter — the actions of Rolling Stone and Managing Editor Giles Muhame are appalling. Under Muhame’s direction, Rolling Stone first outed over 100 LGBT Ugandans with the headline “Hang Them,” then falsely blamed the LGBT community for bombings in Kampala.
The use of misinformation as a weapon against the Ugandan LGBT community is a central aspect of Call Me Kuchu’s portrayal of the last year of Kato’s life. The bigoted opinions expressed by Muhame, delivered with chilling conviction, reflect the opinion of a large majority of Ugandans, encouraged by the influence of American evangelicals such as Scott Lively and Lou Engle.
In the words of Muhame, “We shall ignore the right of privacy in the interest of the public.”
In addition to Kato’s plight, the film closely follows three other kuchu Ugandans who must deal with damaging press coverage and the danger imposed by Uganda’s proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill.
The stories of Kato, Naome Ruzindana, John Abdallah Wambere (better known as Longjones) and Stosh Mugisha each speak to a different aspect of the kuchu experience in Uganda — experiences that, on a superficial level, aren’t so different than those of LGBT Americans. Naome and Longjones fear whether they should officially come out while Stosh endures the confusion and ridicule that comes with being transgender.
Ugandans have differing reactions toward kuchu identity. Humor is, surprisingly, a pervasive element in Call Me Kuchu. It manifests as a coping mechanism for Kato and his fellow activists when faced with hardship, but it also fuels their celebration of themselves, shown during their impromptu drag fashion show.
On the other hand, laughter also becomes a means of ridicule for anti-LGBT Ugandans to express their lack of support and underlying discomfort with the issue. Though it is reassuring to see Kato make light of certain situations, it is equally alarming to view his opponents jokingly disregard the humanity of the LGBT community.
Politics, religion and sexuality aside, equality is an ideal that shouldn’t have to be compromised. In the United States, the issue of equality is debated in terms of marriage — with whom we can choose to legally partner and raise a family.
In Uganda, equality is reduced to an even more basic level. Not only are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people denied the right to marry, they are under constant threat of exposure and persecution.
The depiction of the Ugandan social situation, aided by the raw testimonies of the film’s subjects  is eye-opening and heartbreaking. Before anyone can truly support an argument against the unalienable human rights, they need only consider what the Ugandan bill implies.
As a doctor, would you report a patient who comes to you in confidentiality, asking for help? As a parent, would you turn in your son or daughter to be imprisoned for life, simply because of an identity they are born with?
Despite the hatred promoted by certain groups, beacons of hope still exist in Call Me Kuchu, even after Kato’s tragic murder. Friendship, for one, emerges as a source of strength for the activists; their love for one another is a testament to the veracity of their cause.
This brings the documentary full circle to its original questioning of the true definition of human rights. Can a man love a man or a woman love a woman just as men and women love each other?
At Kato’s funeral, Bishop Christopher Senyonjo says it best: “I am free because I know the truth. And I will stand for that truth.”

Last Friday, the executive committee of the Boy Scouts of America proposed a change to its national policy that would lift an existing ban on openly gay scouts participating in the organization.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
In an interview with CNN, the organization’s public relations director, Deron Smith, said that “if approved, the resolution would mean that ‘No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.’”
Though this is a positive step, the proposal would maintain the ban on openly gay adults serving as leaders, according to the New York Times. This continuing ban is a step back for the organization. The hypocrisy is evident: How can one manage to both be inclusive and exclusive at the same time?
The proposal will be put to an official vote in May at the organization’s national conference in Dallas. If approved, the policy will take effect at the beginning of 2014, according to CNN.
The road to approval, however, might be rocky.
In determining whether to put forth a proposal for policy change, the BSA’s executive committee conducted a survey of its members regarding their thoughts on the issue. The results of the survey indicated a generational split between the older adults, who generally supported a continued ban of openly gay members and leaders, and the younger parents and teenage members, who opposed the ban, according to CNN. According to the BSA’s official website, the organization is “one of the nation’s largest and most prominent values-based youth development organizations.”
Boy Scouts does, in fact, receive a great deal of its support from religious groups. Of its nearly 100,000 units operating a Boy Scouts program, 70.3 percent of these units are chartered to religious organizations and the most represented religious group is the Church of Latter-Day Saints, operating 37,856 total units, according to the BSA website.
Given the involvement of such a disproportionately large number of religious groups with traditional social values, it should not be surprising that the issue of whether to allow openly gay individuals to participate or lead in the Scouts is an especially contentious one.
Yet there’s no denying the increasing support for gay rights, rights that will only continue to become more entrenched within the national conscience as time passes, regardless of what the national board decides in May. Even if it does not happen this year, there should be no doubt that a more inclusive and just policy is in the near future for the Scouts.
Yes, the proposal is a step in the right direction, but it is also a plan dripping with hypocrisy. Accepting gay members as Scouts but rejecting anyone gay as unfit to be a leader ignorantly and nonsensically suggests that being gay is incompatible with the values of leadership and integrity as soon as a boy turns 18.
Richard Ferraro, vice president of communications for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination, said in an interview with the New York Times, “What this resolution appears to be doing is reinforcing the outrageous idea that gay people somehow pose a threat to kids, which experts like the American Psychological Association have dismissed for more than a decade.”
And Jennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian woman who was dismissed as her son’s den leader last year, said in a statement: “One year after sending a letter ousting me as my son’s leader, the Boy Scouts are once again forcing me to look my children in the eyes and tell them that our family isn’t good enough.”
This new proposal is an obvious attempt by the Scouts to please both the socially conservative groups that fund it as well as the millions who oppose it.
Therefore, BSA should certainly be lauded for its step in the right direction. It is time, however, to complete that walk. Instead of tip-toeing around the issues, hoping that they just go away, BSA needs to proactively create a proposal with the goal of including all.
Families such as Tyrrell’s deserve the chance to live their lives as equally as any other so that, one day, Tyrrell can finally look her son in the eyes and tell him that their family is more than good enough.
They’re normal.

In the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building, Timothy James McVeigh killed 168 people. He was arrested, read his Miranda rights and convicted by a fair and impartial jury of his peers. McVeigh was a citizen of the United States of America. McVeigh was a white Roman Catholic.
In his bombing of the Boston Marathon and subsequent flee from police, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is suspected of killing five people. He was arrested and not immediately read his Miranda rights so that he could be questioned under the public safety exception to determine if the public was in further danger, according to the New York Times. In a press release, four Republican senators suggested he be held as an enemy combatant, the same designation given to non-citizens captured on foreign battlefields and held at Guantanamo Bay. Tsarnaev is not white. He is a Chechen Muslim.
An individual suspected of a crime is read Miranda rights to protect him or herself from making self-incriminating statements. The public safety exception to the Miranda rule, as defined by the Supreme Court, allows officials to question a suspect (without Mirandizing him) about imminent threats to public safety, such as the location of a gun.
In certain cases, the public safety exception would make sense. This is not one of those cases. According to Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz in an interview with Newsmax, the grounds for questioning Tsarnaev under the public safety exception are dubious at best.
“In this case the two defendants have been apprehended. One is dead. The other is under surveillance. They have access to his home. They have access to all of the explosives,” Dershowitz said. “The police chief has said there’s no continuing danger. What they’re seeking is information — intelligence information — and the public safety exception simply doesn’t apply to that.”
But other tactics go even further. In an interview with the Washington Post, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he wants Tsarnaev to be labeled as an enemy combatant and recommended he be interrogated for 30 days without the constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants.
Not only is such a designation unconstitutional, it is a designation unfounded in fact and one that suggests a deeper and more sinister problem in America.
The designation of the label “enemy combatant” is given to individuals arrested on the battlefield who are members of an organization known to oppose the United States. Yet,  CNN reports that the brothers supposedly acted alone, without the aid of an organized extremist group.
The constitutional grounds for such a designation are also unfounded. In Hambdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for the Supreme Court, said, “We agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.”
Though the public safety exception, created by the Supreme Court, does allow for a brief interrogation to determine future threats, designating Tsarnaev as an “enemy combatant” would cross a constitutional line.
More troubling is the sudden designation of the bombing as an act of terrorism. Such designation begs the question — does it take a suspect of a crime to be Muslim and nonwhite before the word “terrorism” gets tossed around? Were murderers Adam Lanza or James Holmes or Jared Loughner labeled terrorists, even though they killed far more than people than the Tsarnaev brothers did? No.
Did Graham, who said in an interview with the Post that the Boston bombing “is Exhibit A of why the homeland is the battlefield,” say the same about Sandy Hook Elementary School, the movie theater in Aurora or the Safeway in Tucson? No.
In fact, there are lots of problems with the rhetoric surrounding the bombing in Boston. In the week before the Boston crisis, the Republican Party came together to defeat a plethora of proposals that would, in its eyes, harm the Second Amendment.
The assault weapons ban, the universal background check rule and the high-capacity magazine ban were all defeated because of their potential to harm the Second Amendment. To the GOP, the slightest risk that a law runs afoul of the Constitution is enough to merit its rejection.
But the Constitution does not just apply to gun owners — it applies to everyone. If due process is effaced in favor of an “enemy combatant” label for an individual with no known ties to an enemy of the United States, there is nothing to shield the innocent from the overreaching of bureaucrats. Tsarnaev is innocent until proven guilty, not through trial by media, but through a civilian trial with a jury of his peers.
If the war on acts of mass violence cannot be won without destroying the Constitution, than we have already lost.
 
Nathaniel Haas is a freshman majoring in political science and economics.
Not sure what the debate is all about.  Everyone says he has a “right” to have his Miranda rights read to him.  This simply isn’t the case, and everyone in the media is clueless to the actual law — which is to say, that these Miranda rights are only necessary IF THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO USE THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT AT HIS TRIAL.  If they DO NOT want or need to use those statements, they can talk to him without reading him his rights.  Of course, if anything is coerced out of him and as a result more evidence is found against him as a result of his coerced statements, that presents a problem, but this issue that the police had an “obligation” to read him his Miranda rights and that that’s the end of the story is ludicrous.
Can we stop charging people with “terrorism”? Exploding bombs inside one of these united states is TREASON.
The Boston Bomber also deserves a fair execution as well.
The white “Christians” you mention were not practicing Christians while the Tsarnaev brothers were devout Muslims who strongly identified with Al Qaeda.  You’re comparison is misleading and only serves to muddy the water.
There is little doubt – other than in the deluded minds of liberals – that Islam is a supremacist religion with core tenets that promote and encourage violent and aggressive jihad against non-believers.  It is imperative that our leaders be vigilant when confronted with Muslims who act on these Islamic values.  
I do not understand the nuances of the legal procedures used in treating the surviving Tsarnaev brother differently than they usual suspect, but I have read from experts in this field that there was nothing illegal in doing so.
I’m glad that I’m not the only one who shares this opinion. Thanks for writing about this.
The suspect is an American citizen and by the letter of the law he should have his Miranda rights read and should be tried in a court of law and convicted by a jury of his peers.   The suspect was not born in the United States right? He is not a real American or an American born citizen right? I have a question for the immigration department or anybody that wants to respond.  Why does the United States allow and give people access to immigrate to the United States legally knowing there from Mid-Eastern countries that have a strong Al Qaida presence but we do not allow or give access to legal immigration from individuals from Mexico ?  Which is why most Mexican people risk their lives coming into this country illegally because if they were given the same immigration opportunities the Mid-Eastern people get then they would not com e into our country illegally?   99 percent of Mid-Eastern people are great people it’s the one percent of the people that want to destroy America. I know that some Mexicans come to our country to have kids and live off the government but most come to work jobs Americans don’t want or are too lazy to work.   I served eight years in the US Army and two combat tours so I have met Al Qaida and other Muslim terrorist on the battle field.  My point is that the United States does not allow or provide legal immigration access to Mexicans who come to this country to work jobs Americans don’t want like picking fruit in the California fields but the United  States allows and provides legal immigration access to people that come from the Mid-East and who com e to bomb and kill Americans like in Boston or the guys that flu the two planes into the World Trade Center.  What’s wrong with American when Fox News and CNN are blaming Mexican illegal’s for all the problems in America but not questioning why so many people from the Mid East get papers to legally live in the US so then they can become US citizens and commit a terrorist act on American soil against Americans.  I love America and I’m proud of being an American, I have earned my freedom on the battlefield fighting against our enemies that now allowed to immigrate to our country.  GO ARMY BEAT NAVY!!!
Although not born in America, Dzhokhar became a citizen and was a sophomore in college studying marine biology and wanted to be a dentist. Disregarding the prejudice behind excluding a whole population because they are residents from Middle Eastern countries, the Tsarnaevs are from a region of Russia – not the Middle East. Although immigrating is a difficult, long, and complicated process, it is allowed from Mexico, Russia, Middle Eastern countries….
Nate,
You are correct about this, but you are spending a lot of effort knocking down a “strawman” (a non-issue).  You argue beautifully about an obvious conclusion already made.
Yes, the “enemy noncombatant” designation was bandied about, but naturally nothing came of it. Perhaps it would have made sense if the bomber were caught in Afghanistan waging war against American troops, but nothing like that happened. Instead, a US citizen on US soil committed violent acts against ordinary civilians. Horrible as it was, it was and is for state and Federal courts to try.
Now turn your excellent logiic and writing skills toward a real issue.
Mr. Harmon, 
Thank you for your comments. 
For our sake, I wish it was a non-issue. 
The Obama administration’s statement that Tsarnaev will not be treated as an enemy combatant does not excuse the five Republican senators and representatives who still persist that he be tried as such. Senator Graham suggested on Monday morning that he be detained for thirty days for intelligence-gathering purposes, without access to a lawyer. 
This morning, Senator Graham said in an interview that the Obama administration was “letting its guard down.” 
I think the idea that five elected officials would protect the Constitution in some instances and eschew it in others is certainly a real issue. The correct decisions of the majority to not excuse the dangerous suggestions of the minority.

Chris Paul crossed over at the top of the three-point arc, took five aggressive dribbles, and attacked the right side of the lane. As the floater left his fingertips, there was no doubt over what the result would be. There was nothing the outstretched arms of Tony Allen and Darrell Arthur could do. The shot banked in, and the Los Angeles Clippers took a commanding 2-0 lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.
With the series now heading back to Memphis, the Grizzlies will have to figure out a way, if there is any, to stop Paul. The diminutive floor general – widely considered the best point guard in the league – has had his way with Grizzlies. He’s dictate their pick-and-roll coverage, finding open teammates in the 3-point corner and under the rim, and making unbelievable plays like he did Monday night.
The opening weekend of the playoffs was somewhat of a bore. Six of the eight games were decided by double-digits. Another game, the Denver Nuggets vs. the Golden State Warriors, came down to a buzzer-beater, but it was by wily veteran Andre Miller, who hardly moves the needle among casual basketball fans.
So Paul’s shot was the first dose of exciting playoff basketball, like the first crazy upset in March Madness. The Clippers defeating the Grizzlies was no upset — they led almost the entire game — but it was a dramatic moment on the grandest stage, and Paul calmly showed us why he’s been in the MVP conversation all season.
While 24 points and 9 assists would be a career game for most NBA players, it was just another ordinary outing for Paul. And although he was the primary factor in the Clippers’ victory, he was certainly not alone.
Blake Griffin scored 21 points, a significant increase from an 11-point outing in Game 1, when he dealt with foul trouble and frustration. Griffin made it clear that he was the best big man in the series, at least offensively, and that no Grizzly has a chance of defending him one-on-one. With a series of hook shots, spin moves, and up-and-unders, Griffin flashed the post moves most detractors have been waiting for.
The third leg of the Clippers’ attack was Jamal Crawford, who had found out earlier in the day that he finished second in the Sixth Man of the Year award, a snub in his eyes. The Grizzlies were the brunt of his retaliation, including 15 points and a bevy of ball-handling highlights and step-back jumpers.
The admirable performance of his sidekicks notwithstanding, Paul was the star of the best game in these young playoffs. There will certainly be other close games and game-winning shots, but few will top what Paul pulled off.
Many pundits have been skeptical of the Clippers all season, and picked the Grizzlies to win the series despite not having home-court advantage. It appears, however, that the Clippers have found their mojo and returned to their level of play this winter, when they reeled off 17 wins in a row and went undefeated in the month of December. With the way they’ve played recently, maybe they can even challenge the mighty Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round.
But whether you believe in them or not, the Clippers are sure fun to watch. Leave it to Lob City to properly commence the postseason. Welcome back playoff basketball, we missed you.
I’m tuning in to watch my Nuggets games live when they’re on, but this is a very intense series to watch too, as is the CHI/BKN matchup.  I work a lot of late night at DISH, so the DVR is working overtime, and I’m glad I have one that can finally handle all the games I want.  It used to be a problem recording the games I wanted to watch, and the wife was always mad, but I got the DISH Hopper, and with up to 2,000 hours of storage I have no worries about filling up the hard drive anymore.

The NBA Playoffs are finally here, so I reached out to Daily Trojan sports editor and NBA diehard Alex Shultz to do a back-and-forth for this week’s Trojan Fix.
This is a slightly edited transcript of a back-and-forth between the two of us that occurred during the last game of the regular season last Wednesday. Every Game 1 has already concluded, but I’ve left those untouched for your reading enjoyment.
Agree? Disagree? Want to mock me for being a homer? Leave a comment and let us know how you feel.
 
(1) Heat vs. (8) Bucks
Alex Shultz: Miami wins this series in four and I haven’t been so sure of something in a very long time.
Euno Lee: You know, I’ve heard somewhere that Brandon Jennings and Monta Ellis wanted this matchup since they match up well against the Heat. Obviously that confidence is hopelessly misplaced here. I also have Miami winning in four.
AS: I guess Jennings matches up well with Mario Chalmers, but if he gets hot, they’ll just stick LeBron on him and Jennings will average more turnovers than assists for the rest of the series. Yeah, this matchup doesn’t require much analysis.
 
(2) Knicks vs. (7) Celtics
EL: Boston’s had a rough week. Do you think that emotion counts for something in a series against New York?
AS: I don’t mean this as a shot against the Celtics or their character, because I have no doubt this is weighing heavily on them, but I just don’t see that influencing the series. I’m not sold on New York, even though they’re hot and won 54 games this year, but I’m even less sold on a Boston team without Rondo. The C’s are a proud group and they’ll put up a fight, but I’ve got New York in six games.
Do you think Boston has anyone that can check Carmelo?
EL: I don’t think there’s anyone in the league who can check Carmelo right now except maybe Carmelo. Boston’s known for being one of the more mentally tough teams in the league, especially come playoff time when they really turn up the intensity. I don’t think the Garnett comments from earlier in the season have really cooled off yet, and things like that might really come to a head this series. I think it’s New York in seven.
AS: Interesting. I guess I have less faith in KG and Pierce right now than you do. But considering their respective histories, that might be dumb of me.
EL: They’re both definitely a couple steps from the glue factory, but we’ll see.
 
(3) Pacers vs. (6) Hawks
AS: This is going to be a brutally boring series. I have no interest in watching the Atlanta Hawks play basketball against a defensive-minded team. Indiana is far superior in my mind, even though they only won five more games. I’ve got Pacers in five.
EL: I’ve got the Pacers in a sweep. I really don’t see anyone from Atlanta producing enough to break through that Pacer defense. I also agree that this series is going to be a cure for insomnia.
Let’s move on before I fall asleep.
 
(4) Nets vs. (5) Bulls
AS: Ugh, another snoozer. I’ve found Chicago to be the least-fun team to watch this season without Derrick Rose. Yes, Nate Robinson is fun to watch on his thrice-a-year point explosion, but Chicago’s game plan is clunking mid-range jumpers and playing incredibly physical defense. That actually would bode well normally, but the Bulls are still sort of banged up. Still, I see them wearing down the Nets and winning in seven grueling games. Six of those will probably not be worth your time.
EL: The Bulls might be banged up, but the Nets might be even worse for the wear. You know I was really hoping the Nets would be more fun to watch this year, but their offense is surprisingly impotent despite all the talent. I feel like the slightly-banged up Nets are going to be really banged up after this series, asyou’ve got players sitting out for ticky-tack injuries and I don’t think the Nets have the mental or physical toughness to hang with a Chicago team that’s going to use every little dirty defensive trick in the book to gain an advantage. Chicago wins in the longest 5 games of Brook Lopez’s life.
AS: Five games huh? I guess I’ve got it going longer because Deron Williams is legitimately playing like an All-Star again, and assuming Derrick Rose doesn’t descend from the basketball heavens, I don’t see Chicago’s backcourt helping their cause. But I love Chi Town’s advantage in the paint and I agree on Lopez, who has played really well.
EL: Deron’s back for sure, I’m just not sure if that’s going to be enough against a Bulls squad that’s going to pretty much close off all of his passing lanes. Deron has his fans, but I think his mobility has suffered this season and I don’t see him willing his team to victory in a game with playoff-level intensity.
 
(1) Thunder vs. (8) Rockets
AS: I think it would be the coolest thing ever if Harden went into OKC and somehow just ripped them to shreds. But it’s not going to happen. Houston is dangerous because its offense is so streaky and the Rockets will make this series competitive-ish, but give me OKC in five.
EL: I also want Harden to go into OKC and basically rip the Thunder a new one. I see this team with their two wings in Lin and Harden stirring up trouble, but I don’t think OKC trails at any meaningful juncture in any game the whole series en route to a sweep. OKC is just too deep and has talent in the frontcourt that Houston just can’t match. Also, if Steve Blake can score 24 points on your defense, I shudder to think what Russell Westbrook will do.
AS: The thing with Houston is they’re going to let up 100 points in all of these games, but they’ll score 115 in one of them. But I mean we’re picking at straws here, we basically agree. Here we go, Lakers/Spurs. Euno “Homer Mode”, activate.
 
(2) Spurs vs. (7) Lakers
EL: Alright first of all, for transparency’s sake, I’m being as objective as I can when I say the Lakers are going to win this series. It’s going to take 6 games, but is anyone else wondering what this team looks like when a healthy Dwight Howard has the ball in his hand? With Pau Gasol passing the way he is right now? With Steve Nash back and running this system?
I feel like Howard outmuscles Duncan in the post. Steve Nash can’t play defense to save his life and Tony Parker is going to torch us, )I mean the Lakers), but if Dwight Howard can minimize Tim Duncan’s impact off the ball and be a menace in the paint, I see the Lakers winning hard fought games en route to a huge first round upset.
AS: I am wondering what this team looks like when healthy. Want to know why? Because they’re never healthy! Steve Nash is going to be way less than 100%, and the Lakers haven’t used that lineup all season.
I love the way Gasol is playing. It’s a talented squad and it’ll give a struggling Spurs team some trouble, but the Lakers without Bryant won’t be able to muster an upset.
But let’s be real. Tony Parker is one of the three or four best players in basketball not named LeBron James. Duncan can’t outmuscle Howard, but he doesn’t need to. Duncan might be the smartest player in the NBA. The Spurs have wings that can eat up the Lakers’ wings. I just don’t trust LA to put it together for a complete series against a really tough team. Spurs in six.
 
(3) Nuggets vs. (6) Warriors
AS: Denver-Golden State is so much better than any Eastern Conference matchup. So many fast break points will be scored.
EL: Denver and Golden State is going to be a track meet.
AS: The Warriors are a confounding team, because if they played like they did in the first half of the season I’d actually give them a legitimate shot to beat Denver. But I don’t think they’re the same team anymore. The Nuggets will move past the loss of Gallinari better than most people think they will. I’ve got Denver in five close games. That sounds like a slight against Golden State, but I really think every game will be competitive. They’ve got a bright future. Just not this year.
EL: I think Golden State’s is of hearing “not this year.” This postseason might be the one where they get over the hump. Andrew Bogut is on track to be back in the playoffs for the first time in seven years, and while I don’t think he makes a giant impact, I think people are underrating his potential to contribute. Also, losing Gallinari, who was having a career season, is actually pretty big. It’s hard to guard a guy like him, and it makes the Nuggets a bit easier to figure out offensively when you can contract the floor. I have the Warriors winning this one in six very entertaining games.
AS: I think Gallinari is valuable in the fourth quarter when you need to turn to a scorer and that will hurt Denver against better teams, but Golden State is a pretty average defensive team (that’s probably being generous) and I think Wilson Chandler/Corey Brewer are enough on the wing to allow Denver to win this series quickly.
 
(4) Clippers vs. (5) Grizzlies
EL: I’m taking the Grizz here in six games. To paraphrase my favorite center ever, the Clippers offense is like a Corvette and the Grizzlies’ defense is like a brick wall.
AS: So for the sake of transparency, I’m a die-hard Wizards fan (laugh it up) but I also unabashedly root for the Clippers come playoff time because my actual team never makes it this far. With that being said, I feel like you could’ve made that brick wall comparison last season and the Clippers still prevailed in seven.
I LOVE watching Marc Gasol play and he’s going to eat Deandre Jordan alive, but Memphis can only grind it out for so long. The Clippers are too deep and I think they’ll eventually wear Memphis down. When in doubt, choose Chris Paul. I’ve got Clips in six.
EL: I’m actually rooting for the Clippers to lose in the first round, so that Chris Paul becomes disgusted with the state of affairs in Clipperland and signs with the Lakers after Mitch Kupchak gets his arm twisted by Dwight Howard to amnesty Kobe and sign CP3. Just saying.
