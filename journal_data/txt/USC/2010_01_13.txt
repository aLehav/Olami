It takes the keen eye and direction of fashion designer Tom Ford to express the beauty in desperation, and his first film, A Single Man, does so remarkably.
Based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood, the film, set in Los Angeles in 1962, follows a day in the life of gay college professor George Falconer. Played with inspirational grace by Colin Firth, George, who has recently lost his partner of sixteen years in a tragic car accident, plans to kill himself once the day ends.
Throughout the course of the movie George reflects back on moments spent with his lost love Jim (Mathew Goode), with each memory pushing him closer and closer to his own demise. Along the way, however, he encounters friends and strangers who all seem to resonate some form of romance, whether it be impromptu, failed or even just its possibility.

A Single Man is filled with outstanding performances, the most exceptional one, of course, belonging to Firth. As reliable as ever, Firth finally seems to command his own film by portraying desperation in its most brutal form, as he must hide it from the world that surrounds him.
What is most crippling for George is that to express his grief he must also reveal his homosexuality, creating an entirely new pain.
Firth resonates complete isolation as he is locked within his own ideas of love and sexuality, which — in 1962 — are not shared by the majority of society. The only solace he can find is in his close friend Charley (Julianne Moore,), which unfortunately is half-hearted, since she herself has been pining for his affection for years.
Moore presents the traditional, convenient adoration of heterosexual love that George has so much trouble with, and her performance is phenomenal. She has not been this good since her role in 1997’s Boogie Nights.
And then there is Jim, whose portrayal by Goode gives the film its sweet, sincere tone, but also provides its most bitter one as he represents all which has been lost for George. Goode has charm that he conveys without even speaking, and it fits well into a character that cannot be forgotten.
The three actors each contribute their own talent to the film, but the real artist is designer Ford, who makes his directorial debut with stunning poignancy. His eye for fashion completes this film as it expresses intense romance, even when it is illustrated within such a heartbreaking situation.
Beauty is found in every single frame, whether it is George’s suit, Charley’s chic, mod hairdo — which resonates even more vividly with her stunning red hair — or in more simple scenes in which hardly any words are spoken.
One of the film’s most prominent moments is a dance sequence between George and Charley in which the 1962 classic instrumental song “Green Onions,” by Booker T. & the M.G.’s, intercuts all dialogue and simply hints at the idea of possibility, even when tragedy is close by.
It is the film’s aesthetics, which are also accorded to the cinematography, that acknowledge the beauty George, as a single man, cannot. Ford’s true power as a director lies in his ability to showcase a film involving homosexuality without making a movie that is overtly about homosexuality.
A Single Man is not a “gay movie.” Not once does Ford underplay or exhaust the subject. A Single Man is a film about romance, with homosexuality adding to the isolation and plaguing pain that accompanies the main character’s loss.
Like Brokeback Mountain, Ford’s film moves far beyond the expected presence of a subject such as homosexuality in cinema and centers on the idea of not knowing what to do next after experiencing the loss of a loved one.
With an effort such as this, Ford, who is renowned in the fashion world already, is certainly deserving of a Best Director nomination at this year’s Academy Awards. But whether he receives one or not, his  ability to create beautiful films is undeniable.

These days it is hard to find something good on T.V. Long-form shows tend to get canceled in their first season because of poor ratings and network meddling (like the genius shows Firefly and Traveler), while the ones that are lucky to last long are nearly done, such as Lost.
Because of the recession, it has been harder for studios to finance sitcoms and hour-long dramas, leading to late-night talk shows creeping into prime time and a flood of D-list celebrity reality shows — as if we needed any more of those. No, seriously, we don’t need any more of those. 
Because of the lack of quality programming on our once-trusty television sets, people — and especially students — are turning to the Internet more for their serial entertainment.
Television and the Internet have been in the process of crossing over for the last few years. Apple’s product, Apple TV, has let owners watch iTunes-purchased T.V. show episodes since its debut in 2007, and websites like Hulu allow users to watch their favorite shows online.
But while Apple TV and Hulu are popular for bringing televised content to the web, they aren’t able to match the creative talent that comes from exclusive web series.
Recently, there’s been an explosion of high quality shows on the web, and these days, some of the most innovative and entertaining shows are coming out via the Internet and not mainstream television networks.
This explosion is not just with talk show podcasts like Diggnation or The Totally Rad Show, but is increasingly scripted dramas and comedies. The long running podcast Tiki Bar TV continues to be the funniest thing online with quirky characters, odd situations and cocktail recipes that manage to solve every problem they face, while The Guild takes a whimsical and offbeat look at online role playing and the personal lives of the players.
Meanwhile a lot of studio-backed shows like Angel of Death and the upcoming The Bannen Way are showing that gritty action-noir or complex, Guy Ritchie-esque crime stories are not exclusive to television.
And studios are catching on. The newfound faith the big shots have in web television is showing, with sleeker production values and well-known actors.
Web shows are in many ways an indie filmmaker’s dream. Instead of needing millions of dollars, A-list celebrities and focus groups to make a movie, you just need a camera, a cast and Internet access, and suddenly you have an audience in the millions. People used to struggle forever to pitch a show or a film to studios, and now they don’t have to. The Internet lets someone reach out to the niche they are filming for, and thanks to social networking, videos easily snowball into massive Internet successes.
But these new web series are not limited to just cult audiences and have even been validated by the T.V. Academy. While network television came to a screeching halt during the 2008 writers’ strike, Buffy the Vampire Slayer-creator Joss Whedon wrote and filmed Dr. Horrible’s Sing Along Blog, which went on to win an Emmy.
Big time shows like Heroes and Fringe have struggled with budget concerns (with Fringe recently relocating production from New York City to Vancouver to save money), while web shows thrive on de facto low budgets.
Instead of relying on expensive sets and fancy technology, they utilize camera tricks with guerilla filming, turning something shot in a studio apartment into something that looks as good as, if not better than, something out of 24 or CSI.
A recent six-minute Johnnie Walker commercial made for the web is a good example. Beyond the fact that it starred Robert Carlyle — an award-winning actor who appeared in Trainspotting and as Bond villain in The World is Not Enough — the commercial was an incredibly stripped down production, consisting of one camera, a long track of Scottish countryside, a handful of props and little else. The fact that it was an advertisement geared toward web show watchers is only a mild irony to the fact that it was filmed in the same style.
Web television is also unique enough that many actors and creators are turning to the medium in order to try something new. I was at a recent panel on web television hosted by the  website Tubefilter News, where the creators of The Bannen Way showed off some very cool clips of their show, including ones with well-known actors Michael Ironside and Robert Forster. According to the creators, studios are starting to see the appeal of web series, and so are actors, in some cases agreeing to take lower paychecks to participate in a burgeoning medium.
Television shows will probably always reign supreme in popularity, with big name stars and greater production tools. Web television, however, is an underground movement full of new ideas and alternative stories compared to what you find on T.V. and is home to quirky creators who would never get a chance to see their shows come to life on a network.
So if you’re looking for something entertaining and different from cookie-cutter television, check out what’s online.
Besides, we’re college students, aren’t we already on the Internet a lot already? Why not watch some T.V. while we’re at it?

In addition to the many interpretations of the Bible already available, it is now available in comic book form.
But this isn’t a cheesy, stick-figure comic book. Instead, it’s a graphic novel created by the hands of famous underground comic book artist R. Crumb, and it comes with a warning sticker on its cover: “Adult Supervision Recommended for Minors.”
In the beginning · Underground comic book artist R. Crumb’s latest project — The Book of Genesis Illustrated, a word-for-word visual interpretation of the first book of the Bible — is on display until Feb. 7. - Photos courtesy of R. Crumb 
Crumb spent nearly five years researching, drawing and perfecting his latest creation, The Book of Genesis Illustrated — the pages of which are on display at the Hammer Museum until Feb. 7 — but the real question: Why?
What prompted Crumb — a man known for his outrageous and often vulgar comics — to draw every scene, word for word, from the first book of the Bible?
In the posted introduction to the exhibit, “The Bible Illuminated: R. Crumb’s Book of Genesis,” Crumb writes that he does not believe the Bible to be inspired by God, but instead by man. And that is what “The Book of Genesis” is about — man.
Too often the Bible is given an innocent veneer, but “The Book of Genesis” is full of raw and scandalous stories. The people it follows experienced serious issues and real temptations. And they were rugged, dirty and naked. With this perspective, then, it seems — after taking into consideration the nature of his past work — that Crumb might be the only artist appropriate for a project like this.
Because of the explicit nudity present throughout most of his repertoire, Crumb’s work could be considered controversial, but, when put in the context of the Bible, it becomes less offensive and more realistic than ever.
The exhibit is simply each page of his illustrated “Book of Genesis” laid out in chronological order in a round circle. Crumb made the book first and then decided to display it within the museum. The Hammer was able to maintain the integrity of the work’s intended storybook feel.
Mounted in simple black frames, the pages hang at eye level and then continue onto the inner circle of the exhibit. It is a simplistic setup, but still gives off the overwhelming sense of being in a whirlwind, as if the God who created the universe in Crumb’s introduction had also created the exhibit design.
In this setting, the images are impossible to ignore — you truly become immersed in the world of Genesis as the pages line every wall and the stories seem to jump out at you.
Crumb’s interpretations make the Bible real. There isn’t a distance between the viewer and the page — there is a connection, one that makes a dense and heavily religious subject easy to understand and more enjoyable.
In addition to the whirlpool of comic book pages, the exhibit takes Crumb’s project one step further. Presumably to prove the validity of his illustrations — and possibly to fend off accusations that he is a nudity-obsessed pervert — the museum also displayed the research Crumb conducted on biblical times and several other comic book bibles, all opened to the chapter of Genesis.
Crumb compares these comic book bibles and criticizes them for claiming to be the “word of God.” He points out that these bibles ad lib, paraphrase and add conversations between the characters while he took the bible word for word and added more historically accurate and ethnic-looking pictures.
These comparisons are not to say that his is more “the word of God” than the other, but to raise the question: When is something the “word of God” and when is it the word of man?
To his credit, Crumb’s work prompts much discussion on what is blasphemous, and, regardless of his intentions, his illustrated “Book of Genesis” forces viewers to confront both religious and social taboos that are ordinarily avoided.
Crumb’s work is both thought-provoking and entertaining, and the exhibit is worth going to see simply for the impeccable artistic skills that has made him such an infamous figure in the art world.
R. Crumb has been a master of the comic book arts for more than half a century, and to see his work for free in a museum is a rare opportunity. Definitely take advantage.

Air travel has quickly become an infamous inconvenience in American life.
As a direct result of the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which created the Transportation Security Administration, an organization tasked with improving airport security by way of more thorough screening procedures for passengers and their baggage. Since then, many new security measures have come into effect, requiring all passengers to remove their shoes and restricting liquid carry-ons.
Unfortunately, following the Christmas Day attempt to bomb a Northwest flight by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old man with purported ties to Al Qaeda, it seems inevitable that airport security will become even more of a hassle. The TSA is looking to expand the use of full-body scanning machines, which are able to identify weapons, explosives and wires that evade normal metal detectors. But in addition to detecting hidden contraband, these machines scan through clothing and generate a black-and-white photo of the body, raising concerns about privacy. Understandably, the American Civil Liberties Union is opposed to taking such measures to tighten security.
Daily Trojan | Thomas Curry
Since April 2008, full-body scan machines have already been in partial use at Los Angeles International Airport, which is frequented by USC students. The Los Angeles airport police union is now urging the machines be a requirement for every passenger. Many people might find this inconvenient.
In looking at the overall goal, however, it seems much more important to remain safe and secure. President of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association Marshall McClain recently released a statement in support of the full-body scan: “All available technology and tools must be used to fix an obvious gap in security that puts airline travelers and crew members at risk. Testing of whole-body scanners at LAX has shown them to be highly effective in keeping dangerous materials off airplanes.”
The photo produced by the scan blurs out every passenger’s face and is instantly deleted after viewing. Also, a study by the American College of Radiology concluded that the radio waves used in the screening process are in no way harmful.
These full-body scans may also be preferable to an alternative safety procedure ­— more thorough body pat-downs, akin to police frisking. A test was conducted in 2007 at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, where passengers had a choice between doing a full-body scan or getting a pat-down. According to the TSA, 90 percent of passengers chose to be scanned.
The current pat-down system is generally ineffective, as only the arms and legs are touched. Usually weapons will be hidden in more concealed places, such as the groin area that are off-limits when conducting pat-down searches — a security gap Abdulmutallab took advantage of.
Critics of the full-body scan machine also question the extra amount of time it would require travelers to arrive at the airport. As it is, people tend to arrive at the airport hours before their flight. An added full-body scan, which takes roughly 30 seconds to complete, could potentially tack on an hour or more to travel time. But though spending another hour lounging on the beach during a vacation beats the heck out of waiting in line at the noisy airport, it would be wise to take the extra precautions to ensure a safe arrival in the first place.
Abdulmutallab’s attempted bombing revealed weaknesses in the current air travel system. It seems that once an event like this occurs, everybody gets frightened and airport security steps up in response, but, after a while without incident, things start to get lax again.
Perhaps, if airports were to be consistent with strict security, potential terror attacks would be deterred. It would be ideal if we lived in a world where our airports didn’t have to be under terror watch at all but unfortunately, it’s a very real and very serious issue.
Cooperating with harsher security procedures might make air travel much more unpleasant, but at least we would fly with some peace of mind.

4 words:  High Speed Rail System. 
This is exactly why I miss living in Europe – their rail system is exponentially better than the cattle cars Amtrak provides.  It is real alternative and competition to the airline industry which is why pricing and service on European airlines is so much better than the mess we have here.
“The only reason we don’t have more attacks is that very few terrorists are trying…”
Now how in the world, do you suppose Mr. Disagree knows this?  He nonchalantly writes this as if it’s a well-known fact, when in fact he has no idea that this is true.
Thanks to Islam, Israel’s airport security takes a long time but has prevented any Islamists from achieving their goals.  Let’s face it this is likely where we are heading, and in fact we are a long way toward this major inconvenience.  
Every time I wait in an aiprot security line I thank Islam for all it has contributed to my life.  Things such as having to take my shoes off, remember to bring timy tubes of toothpaste, not to bring bottled water to the airport, and other great things like these. 
Now I understand we can add to this list the inability to go to the airplane’s washroom and hour before landing.  That’s terrific, especially for kids and moms with babies.  Thank you Islam!
It is simply not possible to make air travel 100% safe. I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves how far we are willing to go, how much inconvenience we are willing to put up with, and how much privacy we want to sacrifice for a false sense of security. The fact is that after you walk through airport security you can walk down the terminal to whatever restaurant they have and order a steak with a steak knife. Boxcutter? How do think the people who work at the airport open boxes? These things have already made it past security. The only reason we don’t have more attacks is that very few terrorists are trying, not that our security is good enough to stop them. In the future we will face diminishing returns on all our security measures and increasing attacks on our liberty and privacy. If we allow ourselves to be scanned with these machines then the terrorists have won. They have destroyed the thing that makes us Americans–our freedom.

Nothing says “Happy New Year!” like the sound of hundreds of new state laws taking effect all at once, which, in the case of 2010, might have sounded something like the laments of fast-food restaurateurs, the moos of happy cows, the rapid flight of birds away from all airports and the cheers of college students who, for whatever reason, need to get their hands on a restraining order fast.
This fresh batch of new rules and regulations, cooked up by our friends over in Sacramento for the supposed betterment of our collective well-being, seem well-intentioned in the main, even if their impact mostly won’t be felt by we the people. Here, for casual use only, is a mostly arbitrary guide to some of those laws, chosen either for relevance to college students, Californians or sheer comedy.
But first, a warning to human traffickers, nitrous oxide dealers and paparazzi who reside within state boundaries: Your lives will be incrementally tougher in the new year.
As for the rest of us, we are now one step closer to actually fulfilling our annual weight-loss resolutions, thanks perhaps to the most far-reaching of the new rules: essentially a statewide ban on trans fats in all restaurant food.
The passage of the ban has stirred some minor controversy. Obviously, trans fats are bad, and no one can credibly say otherwise. We might recall from health class that they clog arteries and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. They are also right at the fatty center of this country’s obesity epidemic.
Some say Sacramento is overstepping its bounds with this ban; choices are being made for us by people who think they know best. Well, they are, but, in this case, its fat-free heart is in the right place. Trans fats are cheaper to cook with, and prices could potentially increase as a result of the ban. But, if it means Californians will be a few pounds lighter, mm, mm good.
(There is a minor scandal, however, that must be mentioned: The ban applies to all food facilities in California except school cafeterias — where we cultivate a palate for fatty foods. This seems entirely backwards. Children, be vigilant and boycott.)
For college students specifically, two new measures stand out. Universities can now obtain restraining orders on behalf of students against someone who has threatened them with violence. This is a serious new measure, and should be treated as such. No one wants college officials handing out restraining orders willy-nilly, but if a student needs one, it should be easier now to obtain it.
In other college-related news, companies that sell textbooks in California will have to make them available electronically by 2020. Why this is necessary, one cannot be entirely sure, but, if it reduces costs, who’s to say no? At the same time, the notion of online textbooks makes one wonder: Are “physical” books becoming obsolete? The people at Amazon think so; their Kindle is slowly taking over. But much of the learning process takes place on the physical page — underlining, circling, highlighting. Electronic books sound convenient, but may distance us even further from the material.
Now for a few fun animal-related rules of no immediate consequence. California cows, no doubt happier now than ever, are henceforth safe from tail-docking, a cruel practice whereby dairy farmers cut off part of their tails (think Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh, except he’s a donkey). Also, birds that pose a danger to aircraft can now be killed, state fish and game laws notwithstanding.  Finally, spectators at dogfights will now face harsher penalties.
Other new laws involve very small, but nonetheless welcome, victories for gay rights; the recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states prior to the passage of Proposition 8, and the commemoration of Harvey Milk’s May 22 birthday as a day of recognition.
There we have it — one more year, hundreds of new laws. Most are fairly hard to care about, but we owe it not only to ourselves but also to our statesmen to at least try. These are rules intended to improve society, and even if that improvement is incremental, it is improvement nonetheless. We must constantly be wary, however, of bureaucracy, and, with each new batch of rules, bureaucracy inevitably expands. Although praiseworthy, the ban on trans fats essentially puts our dietary choices into the hands of bureaucrats — a scary notion, indeed.
But at the end of the day, there really isn’t much the vast majority of us will have to do differently in 2010, except wait around for 2011, where we can ignore the indefatigable efforts of our state legislature all over again.

Today, I swiped my meal plan card at EVK, and scanned my options only to realize there was nothing for me to eat. Now, I’m just sitting in my room without any food because I’ve run out of frozen meals … again.
Although students have their complaints about Everybody’s Kitchen and Parkside Restaurant, no one has it worse than students who keep a vegetarian, vegan, kosher or halal diet. 
Having eaten at the two restaurants every day last year, sometimes multiple times a day, I quickly realized that without the meat, poultry and seafood options, students are victims of eating the exact same thing day after day: cereal, salad, pasta and a few rotating side dishes.
But those aren’t meals. They are the appetizers or sides to an entrée. Vegetarian students cannot live on “vegetarian vegetable soup” and undercooked sweet potatoes alone. And students who keep kosher cannot live on the frozen airplane food provided at Parkside. They need substantial meals.
EVK typically rotates through similar veggie choices every week, making it difficult for vegetarians to live on the same food. The salad bar provides just enough choices so that students can switch up the type of salad they eat every day; otherwise, vegetarians and vegans are just out of luck. Fortunately for vegans, some of the on-campus cafés and restaurants like LiteraTea and The Lot make up for what the dining halls lack with their vegan-baked goods.
For students who keep kosher, the selection is absolutely insufficient. Because of the general absence of kosher food on campus, students may have no choice but to surrender to The Man and stop keeping kosher.
Recently, The Lot market started selling kosher sandwiches; until this semester, however, they were kept in the corner of an obscure refrigerator. I will say that some of the sandwiches look quite delicious, except for the one I actually tried.

USC does allow Jewish and Muslim students to live in the Parkside apartments and cook for themselves, which expands their meal choices vastly, but students would greatly miss out on the freshman experience if they did not live in the dorms.
Luckily for me, when I go to EVK, I have the option of meat, chicken or fish, depending on the day. Tuesday is chicken nugget day and every other weekday I can choose from meats inside EVK on the serving platters or outside on the grill. Now that’s what I call options.
So why can’t special diet students have an abundant assortment of food like I do?
They can.
Students’ comments on Yelp.com say that UC Berkeley’s dining hall, Crossroads, offers a splendid array of vegetarian choices for students. Not only does it have a vegetarian section, but also it includes vegetarian options in its “World Flavors” and pizza sections. The dining facilities also provide a wide selection of tofu, beans, soups and meat alternatives daily.
If only USC vegetarians and vegans could brag about such choices.
In terms of kosher food, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign opened a kosher dining hall that serves food from Monday through Thursday.
According to the USC Office of Admissions, roughly 8 to 10 percent of USC’s student body is Jewish. With eight out of every 100 students maintaining a kosher diet, providing hot kosher meals in the dining halls might be a smart move for USC Hospitality.
And as an added bonus, providing kosher food would be killing two birds with one stone. Both Jewish and Muslim students can benefit from kosher meals because Islamic halal dietary laws are similar to kosher meat laws. Therefore, students from both faiths can enjoy a filling and religiously acceptable meal together.
Catering to special diet students isn’t that hard to do. If other schools can do it, so can we. The real issue is whether or not our school is willing to make the effort.
Last year, USC Hospitality hosted a vegetarian recipe contest to stimulate the creation of newer and better vegetarian dishes in the dining halls. From what I noticed after the competition ended, the veggie choices did not improve very much, if at all.
Why put in the effort to make a contest if the effect will be minimal?
I like the intentions, USC Hospitality, but let’s get real and start actually making some positive changes and additions to the food on campus for special diet students.
Danielle Nisimov is a sophomore majoring in public relations. Her column “On the SCene” runs Thursdays.
“I quickly realized that without the meat, poultry and seafood options, students are victims of eating the exact same thing day after day”.
So what you’re saying is that by limiting yourself to eating only vegetables, less options are available to you? I’m shocked.
I can’t eat milk. It makes my visits to the ice cream shop rather limiting. I can complain, or shut up, eat the ice cream and deal with indigestion later. 
The foods you choose to eat are just that: a choice. Eating fish won’t cause an allergic reaction. Perhaps you should put your canine teeth to good use.
Danielle,
Thanks for fighting for us vegetarian folk! I must admit, though, that the problems you bring up for vegetarians are nothing new. Does that mean students shouldn’t fight for more meals for vegetarians in the dinning halls? No, probably not– but it does mean that we, as vegetarians, often “get” the reason why it’s hard to find variety in our meals. It’s a choice we make.  We could complain forever: there isn’t enough low-fat meal variety, or options for those on a gluten-free diet, or folks that are even just lactose intolerant… but as an adult, I hold myself responsible for finding the food I need to fit my selective diet. It’s a good lesson and– quite frankly– I’d rather money and brain-power be spent on increasing our academics and recruiting world-class professors rather than making sure those with food restrictions (like myself) have ever-increasing and always-rotating food options.
Two points:
1) Ever hear of supply and demand? Berkely is full of liberal vegan hippies. More vegeterians and vegans makes it more 
2) The comment that “eight out of every 100 students maintaining a kosher diet” is borderline insulting to Jewish people such as myself. Why are you assuming that everybody who is Jewish keeps Kosher? Most Jewish people at USC – I assure you – do NOT keep Kosher. Jews at USC are typically REFORM Jews, who rarely keep Kosher.

Despite a 9-4 record, USC’s worst mark since 2001, the Trojans anticipate to funnel more than a few players into the National Football League once again. Last season, ‘SC had 11 players taken in the NFL Draft, and in 2010, it hopes to have similar success.
According to a recent list published by the Sporting News, eight USC seniors have been invited to participate in the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine, scheduled for Feb. 24 through March 2 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. (note: underclassmen such as USC’s Everson Griffin, Joe McKnight and Damian Williams, will likely be added later).
The Trojans will certainly be well represented next month in the Hoosier State. OT Charles Brown, C Jeff Byers, RB Stafon Johnson, S Taylor Mays, TE Anthony McCoy, G Alex Parsons, CB Josh Pinkard, and CB Kevin Thomas, are all expected to be in attendance in the hopes of impressing various scouts.
Strong performance in the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, and other combine drills, will be vital for many of USC’s NFL hopefuls.
Just one year ago, quarterback Mark Sanchez proved testament to the theory of a strong showing in the combine leading to a higher selection on Draft Day. Sanchez, who was regarded as a mid-to late first round selection, was so impressive during the Combine that he forced the New York Jets  to trade up from the 17th spot to the 4th spot in order to guarantee they would be able to select the Orange County product.
Using Sanchez as the model, it would be shrewd for these draft-eligible Trojans to take this opportunity seriously.

The first episode of the first season (sans Paula) aired last night and in between laying out pages and sending for finals, I managed to catch a glimpse of the first of several always-infamous audition episodes. Starting with the Boston tryouts, the Idol team (which featured Posh Spice as a pre-Ellen guest judge) sat in a room and rained self-esteem addling comments upon thousands of pitiful wannabes.
Filled with obligatory anime freaks, delusional weirdos and hilarious renditions of songs that are beyond the range of the attempting singers, the ninth season’s inaugural episode didn’t offer anything different than the last eight seasons of laughable rejects. And the chosen few seemed to parody some of the marketable stereotypes from previous seasons.
Ashley Rodriguez (aka Ashley Makailah) seems primed to be the attractive big-toothed ethnic girl, a role previously fulfilled by Diana DeGarmo in season 3 and in season 6 by both Jordin Sparks and Sanjaya (lol).
And Tyler Grady, who came out wearing bell-bottoms and a polyester long-sleeved shirt, could easily be any of a multitude of shaggy-haired classic rock-inspired dudes from previous seasons (see season 5’s Ace Young and Bucky Covington). I even called out his Mick Jagger swagger before they played “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” over his exit.
Maybe they’ll force him to team up with The Stones like Bo Bice or stage an impromptu show with Lynyrd Skynyrd…
The audition episodes continue tonight with Atlanta. Hilarity ensues.

Despite increased security measures at airports after an attempted terrorist attack in the U.S. Christmas day, international students saw little difference in security processes during their travels from their home countries back to USC for the spring semester.
Some of the enhanced security measures, according to TSA spokesman Dwayne Baird are random screening of passengers and secondary screening processes depending on what country the passengers come through. Passengers might also see more law enforcement officers and bomb-sniffing dogs in airports.
Regardless of new security measures, however, USC students said they faced little trouble when traveling back to Los Angeles.
Ivana Filipović, a sophomore majoring in psychology who traveled from Serbia said her experience with airport security was no different than before.
“I can even say that I entered the country more quickly than usual,” Filipović wrote in an e-mail. “The flight and everything else was just as it was each time.”
Satoshi Iwakata, a graduate student studying engineering management, who traveled from Tokyo back to Los Angeles said he heard an announcement on his flight telling all passengers to return to their seats one hour prior to landing. Some airlines are choosing to implement this policy based on advice from the TSA.
Iwakata wrote in an e-mail that it took longer for them to get on the plane than usual, but he didn’t think airport security was unusually strict.
“They checked all the passengers’ baggage,” Iwakata wrote in an e-mail. “They opened every zipper and looked inside. Body check was also for every passenger, but the plane took off as scheduled.”
Juan Orjuela, a sophomore majoring in political science, who traveled from his home country Colombia to Los Angeles said he was expecting a larger increase in airport security after the attempted terrorist attack on Christmas day, but security lines were normal.
“The only thing different was that they opened my carry-on before I went onto the plane,” Orjuela wrote in an e-mail. “Everything else was the same.”

Kyle Prater is officially coming to USC.
The No. 2 ranked recruit in the country, and the top ranked receiver, has finally decided to join the Trojans according to the Chicago Tribune after having reneged on his commitment a few times in the past few months.
Prater was scheduled to enroll last Monday for the spring semester, but he chose to stay home and reevaluate his situation after Pete Carroll resigned. His commitment to USC won’t become binding until National Signing Day on Feb. 3.
However, after hearing that Lane Kiffin was hired as the next coach at USC, Prater all but signed his letter.
“He’s leaving this weekend and will start classes Tuesday,” Sonya Prater, Kyle’s mom, told the Tribune. “Coach Carroll is a great guy and we believe coach Kiffin is a great guy as well. We have a great relationship with him. We believe he can do the same thing he did there a few years ago (as a USC assistant from 2001-06.)
Kiffin already has a relationship with Prater as he was recruiting Prater to join him at Tennessee before he bolted yesterday to become USC’s coach.
“Once (Prater) found out about Kiffin, that was a great thing. He needed that. It was a blow that coach Carroll left,” Sonya Prater said.

In what has arguably been one of the darkest weeks in the history of Trojan athletics, the No. 1 ranked USC men’s volleyball team escaped the purgatory of their Los Angeles campus this past weekend as they began their season on the Hawaiian Islands at the Outrigger Hotels Invitational.
The pre-season No.1 ranking marked the first time in nearly two decades that the Trojans began their campaign at the top of the NCAA. In Honolulu, that ranking was immediately challenged by some of the upper echelon teams from across the country.
In their season-opening match against No. 5 Penn State, the Trojans, behind junior outside hitter Murphy Troy, swept the Nittany Lions with relative ease (30-28, 30-24, 30-24). Troy, a member of the 2009 All-MSPF team, made 11 kills in the match. The biggest surprise of the match came from sophomore libero Andrew Pizula, who was making his first appearance for USC. Pizula carried the team down the stretch with a match-best 12 digs.
USC continued their dominance in the “Aloha State” despite receiving an early scare from No. 10 Ohio State. The Buckeyes took the first set Friday night in resounding fashion (30-20), behind the one-man wrecking crew of Shawn Sangrey. Sangrey recorded a match-high 19 kills and also had seven digs.
After the first set however, the No. 1 Trojans regained their form from last year’s magical run to the NCAA final. USC cruised to victory behind set wins of 30-26, 30-25, and 30-14.
The star of the night was undoubtedly sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who paced the Trojans with an historic eight aces in the match. Ciarelli’s eight aces tied a school record previously held by Beau Rawi since 2001.
“The ace record was somewhat of a surprise to me, when I heard I had eight I didn’t immediately think that it was a record,” Ciarelli said. “It’s something you never expect: to get any record at all. However, now that I know what I’ve done, it is cool to know I have the record.”
In their final match of the invitational Saturday night against No. 12 Hawaii (2-1), the Trojans quickly found out the Warriors were not content with playing the role of a gracious host. Behind an invitational-high 24 kills from junior outside hitter Joshua Walker, Hawaii tripped up the Trojans with a four set victory (30-21, 24-30, 30-28, 30-23).
Troy, the team captain, and Hawaii-native Tri Bourne led USC in the losing effort, with 15 and 14 kills respectively. Senior middle blocker Hunter Current’s .533 hitting percentage was also a match-high.
“Our team understands that in this league, no team goes undefeated,” Current said. “This team is eager to start the MPSF with a slate and continue to prove that our ability and mindset travel much beyond pre-season competition.”
USC (2-1) kicks off the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation portion of their schedule tonight at Pauley Pavilion against cross-town rival UCLA (1-2). The match, which is set to begin at 7 p.m., will continue the team’s string of early season road matches, but the players said they feel as though this match has some extra amount of importance despite being played in January.
“There is a huge rivalry here as they have always been the big dogs of the MPSF,” Ciarelli said. “We want and need the Wednesday game really bad.”

Though property crimes jumped slightly over the past three weeks — due in large part to the absence of students — overall crime rates continue to decrease compared with previous years.
A number of crimes — mostly residential burglaries, bike thefts and auto burglaries — were reported to the Department of Public Safety during the past three weeks, but DPS Capt. David Carlisle said the crime rates this winter break were the lowest they have been in five years.
“We have had a very steady decline in winter break crimes since 2005,” Carlisle said.
Daily Trojan | Leah Turner
DPS is attributing the shrinking crime rates to Compstat, a program initiated by former LAPD Chief William Bratton that helps monitor crime.
“The main thing is measuring where the crime is occurring and really closely measuring crime, monitoring, putting it on a map and holding our supervisors accountable to address strategies that reduce crime,” Carlisle said.
DPS has been consistently working to combat crime during school breaks by offering programs like the Group Initiative for Theft-prevention, which offers free parking for students in the Parking Center, which is patrolled and secured during winter break.
DPS also distributes crime prevention tips to students via e-mail. Carlisle said often when crimes occur it is because students have not adequately utilized DPS’ resources.
“Some of the issues that we have are that people leave over the break and don’t take advantage of the crime prevention programs we offer,” Carlisle said.
Despite the overall drop in crime, Carlisle did cite one serious crime that occurred near campus, when three juveniles tried to rob a woman with a knife near the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and McClintock Avenue.
Though the would-be robbers were caught, Carlisle said DPS is continuing to work to prevent robberies.
“One robbery is too many,” Carlisle said. “But we did catch them and they will be prosecuted.”

After the last Interfraternity Council cracked down on safety during the pre-rush period, the new IFC board is moving to relax those regulations.
On patrol · Department of Public Safety officers and LAPD officers monitor activities on The Row during last year’s Welcome Back Nights, the period before rush. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
During last year’s Welcome Back Nights — the period before rush — IFC banned hard alcohol, common sources of alcohol, such as kegs, and prohibited non-Greeks from attending parties. Though the bans concerning alcohol will remain in place, IFC will not monitor who visits The Row during the pre-rush period.
Instead, both Greeks and non-Greeks will be welcomed at Welcome Back Nights. Parker Adams, IFC’s vice president for public relations, said it is extremely difficult to monitor who attends the Welcome Back Nights party.
“The main reason [for the change] was that it was very hard to enforce that rule and to even determine who is Greek and not Greek,” Adams said. “It was not feasible to assume that members could discern Greeks from non-Greeks.”
Last year’s IFC board had decided to implement the new, stricter rules in hopes of increasing safety after several students were hospitalized during the fall 2008 pre-rush period, according to former IFC president Nick Hamada. The board worked in conjunction with the USC Department of Public Safety to monitor alcohol consumption and compliance with IFC and university policies.
Former IFC President Nick Hamada said the board met with DPS and university officials to develop the regulations for last year’s pre-rush.
“Above all, it was a concern for student safety and recognizing that pre-rush had developed a culture that wasn’t always safe for students,” Hamada said.
Last year’s new measures were aimed not only at increasing safety, but also at preventing chapters from gaining an unfair advantage in the recruitment process.
“Chapters were coming back from break and having social events. That’s a part of fraternity life, [but] these types of social events were not supposed to be used for recruiting,” Hamada said.

Jessica LaBarbera, a senior majoring in communication and memory of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, said although she felt the new rules made last year’s parties more subdued than in previous years, they also created a safer atmosphere.
“Maybe it wasn’t as fun, but I know it was safer, so that’s a trade-off I’m willing to take,” LaBarbera said. “I felt like people were more in control because there wasn’t as much alcohol around.”
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said DPS wants to continue to work with IFC and be proactive in creating safety measures.
“DPS has an excellent relationship with the IFC,” he said. “We share the same goals of maintaining a safe environment in which the Greek community can live, work and go to school.”
Though the new IFC board intends to continue working to improve safety on The Row, current IFC president Eric Ronan said the board will shift its focus to other issues, including creating scholarship opportunities, enhancing communication and expanding community service.

Despite recommendations from student leaders, the group searching for President Steven B. Sample’s successor has decided not to add students to the search committee.
Though members of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee have held sessions with student groups to gather student input, there is no student representation on the committee. This has raised concern among some students and prompted the Undergraduate Student Government to pass a resolution recommending the addition of students to the committee, which currently includes seven trustees and six faculty members.
But even in light of the recommendations from USG and the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, the search committee announced in a leader to the student government presidents that they will not change their process, citing confidentiality, among other reasons.
“We were bummed when we heard that they didn’t want to change their process,” USG President Holden Slusher said.
The last presidential search in 1991 did  include students on the search committee.
But in a recent letter to Johannes Schmitt — the president of GPSS — and Slusher, the Board of Trustees Chairman Edward P. Roski Jr. wrote, “every institution seeks input in a different way, depending on the conditions that exist at the time,” and they “appreciate” the resolution.
Previously, Roski told the Daily Trojan that it was “important” to get student input and that the committee was “making every effort to include student viewpoints.”
Slusher said USG was thankful for the sessions, but  “hopes that student interests were always number one.”
“We trust the trustees in their decision,” Slusher said. “And we understand that there is more to it than what students want.”

No Lexus Gauntlet, no problem in tonight’s early season match between two teams with no love lost between them. As the No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team (2-1) travels across town to legendary Pauley Pavilion to begin Mountain Sports Pacific Federation conference play against their heated rivals the UCLA Bruins (1-2) at 7 p.m.
Different look · Outside hitter Tri Bourne and the Trojans meet a UCLA program that has traditionally been at the top of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference, but has a losing record on the season. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
UCLA, arguably the most successful program in the history of the sport with 19 NCAA Championships, has fallen on hard times since claiming the title back in 2006. Last year, despite a below .500 record (14-16), the Bruins managed to claw their way to the first round of the NCAA Championships. However, UCLA head coach and AVCA Hall of Famer Al Scates was defeated by his former player John Speraw and the eventual champion UC Irvine Anteaters.
This year the team finds themselves in a rare position in the MSPF. While USC received a preseason ranking of No. 1, UCLA will start their 2009-2010 campaign in unfamiliar territory: No. 8 in a conference of 15 teams. Led by senior outside hitter Garrett Muagututia — who led the team in assists per sets in 2009 — and redshirt sophomore opposite Jack Polales — who led the team in kills as a redshirt freshman in 2009 — the Bruins will look to bring back a 20th title to Westwood this season despite a lack of high expectations from outside the university.
In early season play, UCLA finished fourth in last week’s 46th annual Santa Barbara Invitational, despite losing two of their three matches. Although USC players recognize a shift in the balance of power occurring between the two teams in recent years, team members said they understand how meaningful a win at Pauley Pavilion would be so early in the season.
“Of course there is a huge rivalry, they have always been the big dogs in the MSPF,” said sophomore outside hitter Tony Ciarelli. “We want and need the game really bad.”
The match will mark the fourth straight game the road-weary Trojans will be playing away from the Galen Center. The team feels, however, in order to adequately prepare for the level of competition they will likely face during the postseason, these road games are essential.
“Although it may not seem desirable to play tough matches away from home, I feel that our team confidently faces any high-caliber competition out of our comfort zone,” said senior middle blocker Hunter Current. “The lofty expectations on us improve our level of play and prepare the team for a national championship-type environment.”
You are correct…Thanks for reading it, meant to say points per set (conference play)…I appreciate it…
Garrett Muagututia did not lead the Bruins “in assists per sets in 2009”.  You might want to check yourself on that one..

Wow.
Really?
Those were the first two words out of my mouth when I heard Lane Kiffin was hired as the next coach at USC. After it seemed like everyone in the country was turning down the USC job, out of nowhere comes Kiffin. Kiffin’s move is and isn’t surprising.
Like many of the other names tossed around, Athletic Director Mike Garrett is familiar with Kiffin. Kiffin was on the coaching staff under Pete Carroll from 2001 to 2007 — first as a tight ends coach, then as the offensive coordinator for two years — and ran a successful offensive unit through quarterbacks Matt Leinart and John David Booty.
After Kiffin left USC in 2007, he coached the Oakland Raiders for a year and a half before he was let go in a messy firing. He went 5-15 as the coach and was never given a chance by Raiders owner Al Davis.
Yet, while Garrett is familiar with Kiffin, this surprising move reeks of desperation.
Why would Garrett hire Kiffin, who was notorious for his recruiting violations during his one-year stint at Tennessee, at a time when USC’s own program is under NCAA investigation for violations concerning former running back Reggie Bush? And why would Kiffin, who had only been at Tennessee for one year and had, by most accounts, one of the best recruiting classes in the country coming in, bolt from Knoxville, Tenn. so quickly?
The answer is simple: USC needed a coach now in order to retain recruits, and there must not have been many people who wanted the job. Kiffin must have wanted to come back to where he got his start in the coaching ranks and hold a prestigious job in a prestigious football program.
Garrett reached out to four or five candidates (that we know of, possibly more) before he hired Kiffin, who will check his bag containing all his NCAA violations when he boards the plane to come to Los Angeles.
Despite all of this, there is some upside to Kiffin. He runs a pro-style offense, something quarterback Matt Barkley wants, and is a recruiting genius. He also has assembled a highly experienced coaching staff before he has even stepped foot on campus again.
Arguably the most important of those men is Ed Orgeron, one of the best recruiting coordinators in the nation. Orgeron spent a considerable amount of time with USC under Carroll as well at the beginning of the decade. He was one of the men responsible for bringing in the talent that won two straight national championships in 2003 and 2004.
With many of USC’s top-flight recruits wavering on their commitments — including top wide receiver Kyle Prater and MaxPreps.com’s high school player of the year, running back Dillon Baxter — Orgeron will help reel them back in and solidify the recruiting class Carroll started.
Not to be lost in all this is Kiffin’s father, Monte Kiffin, who will join his son’s staff as defensive coordinator. Monte held that title at Tennessee last season, and before that with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1996-2008. Monte is a defensive mastermind who is considered one of the best defensive coordinators in NFL history. He is the father of the famed “Tampa 2” defense that has been imitated by many other coaches across the football world. USC’s defense, which was very strong under Carroll, won’t skip a beat with Monte.
Then there’s Norm Chow. While it’s not official, rumors have been swirling that Chow, currently UCLA’s offensive coordinator, could take on the some role under Kiffin. This would be a dream scenario for Trojan fans who have seen the offense rapidly decline since Chow vacated that same position he held at USC from 2003-2005. It was no secret that Chow and Carroll butted heads, and, with Carroll gone, one of the best offensive coordinators in college football history is free to come back.
Orgeron, Monte Kiffin and Chow are are the core of a very strong coaching staff and USC fans should be delighted to have them wear Cardinal and Gold. This is essentially Carroll’s former staff during his greatest years — minus Carroll.
Still, the hiring of Lane Kiffin is questionable. He went to Tennessee with much fanfare, calling out then-Gators coach Urban Meyer for cheating and providing the now-infamous quote claiming that he would sing “Rocky Top” — the Tennessee fight song — all night long once he Florida. Meyer didn’t cheat, but Kiffin sure did. And Florida beat Tennessee.
Garrett is taking a big gamble with this hiring, and that’s not surprising. This could end up being a brilliant move — or it could also end up being a stupid decision by an athletic director who has proven to be prone to ill-advised decisions.
One thing’s for sure about Kiffin. He will waste no time getting down to business and luring back the wavering recruits
Welcome back, Lane.
I guess I’ll hold my judgment until the end of next season.
 
“Spittin’ Sports” runs Wednesday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Kenny 
at klegan23@gmail.com.
This was totally a move of desperation for Garrett. And the fact that Kiffin bailed on the 3rd best recruiting class in the nation at a university with one of the largest fan bases in the country (you have to admit, selling out 104,000 seats every Saturday is pretty huge), proves the only thing he cares about is himself. I don’t know what he’s lining up these stepping stones toward, unless he eventually wants another stab at the NFL, but Kiffin will not last here. His overall record is a losing one – excellent choice Garrett. Did you mean to hire him as the team manager instead?!
Im not a UT fan however I cant stand Lane Kiffin.  I dont wish ill will on USC only Lane Kiffin and his coaching staff.  What they did was flat our wrong.  I hope USC gets whipped for the next 2 years until they fire LAME Kiffin and all the other losers he is bringing with him.  Actually USC fan base should question why they have hired a Head Coach that has never won more than 55% of his games in a single season.  This guy has not proven anything as a head coach and has only run his mouth with very little to back it up.  Do you really think any recruit is going to believe a word he says?  He isnt respected by fans, the media, his fellow coaches or his own players.  Good luck in the future, I hope you can dump this losers quickly and get someone in there that can bring the respect that Carroll did to your program.
So it seems as though the Vol fans are mad….
You’ll may not want to wait until the end of next season, for he may be off somewhere else by then, he is a liar and a user, oh and a CHEATER. He is just using USC as a stepping stone, just as he used UT, I only hope the NCAA followed him there!!
USC will rue the day Lane Kiffin was named as their coach. He is a confirmed liar and has shown no loyalty anywhere. He is not concerned about the University, the football program, the fans or the players. He is only interested in Lane. No matter what he says, remember, it is a lie. The best predictor of the future is the past.
[…] Fast Hire Seems Desperate | Daily Trojan Why would Garrett hire Kiffin, who was notorious for his recruiting violations during his one-year stint at Tennessee, at a time when USC’s own program is under NCAA investigation for violations concerning former running back Reggie Bush? He is the… […]

Questions abound at USC after the hiring of new coaches Lane Kiffin, Monte Kiffin and Ed Orgeron.
First of all, why Lane Kiffin? The 34-year-old coaching prodigy has quickly ascended the ranks but has made news by alienating many along the way.
Second, how can three high-profile coaches — and possibly four, with former USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow rumored — work together under the microscope in the City of Angels?
And, perhaps most importantly, why so soon?

Kiffin became the youngest coach in NFL history when famed Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis hired him to replace Art Shell at the age of 31, after a six-year stint with USC. He and Davis clashed early and often during their time together with the Raiders, and Kiffin was fired after 20 games at the helm.
He moved to the University of Tennessee in November 2008 and went 7-6 in one season with the Volunteers. Now, just 36 months after leaving USC, Kiffin returns.
Said Kiffin on Monday night in Knoxville, Tenn.: “I really believe the only place I would have left here to go was Southern California.”
USC benefited greatly from former coach Pete Carroll’s uniquely personable attitude, utilizing the icon in a variety of facets across multiple levels and marketing the 58-year-old Carroll and his mantras to no end.
That task gets a lot harder with Kiffin, who has had a love-hate relationship with fans and colleagues on all levels. It won’t be so easy to sell Trojan ideals with Kiffin, a man who already left USC once.
Kiffin was also involved in at least five NCAA violations during his 14 months with Tennessee, the most of any program in the nation.
Obviously — and perhaps boldly, considering recent events — USC isn’t as afraid of possible NCAA sanctions as some might have expected.
But with a deposition from Carroll soon to come in the Reggie Bush case and a university investigation
ongoing on the Joe McKnight, NCAA-imposed sanctions are certainly a possibility.
Kiffin’s hiring won’t decrease that.
But on the field, Athletic Director Mike Garrett will get positive reviews for the coaching staff assembled alongside Kiffin. Joining him will be his father Monte, a noted defensive guru, and Ed Orgeron, a recruiter du jour, former head coach at the University of Mississippi and assistant under Kiffin in Knoxville.
“Lane has surrounded himself with others of similar talent. I can’t tell you how delighted we are to have Ed Orgeron back on staff and to have Monte Kiffin join us,” Garrett said in a statement. “They are some of the preeminent coaches in the game. Ed did a marvelous job during his previous time at USC and we all know that Monte is a defensive guru.
“I know Lane will fill out his staff with other outstanding assistants like them, ones who Trojan players and fans will really like.”
But Orgeron and the younger Kiffin each carry prominent personalities — and, many would say, egos — to USC.
As for the time element, USC  felt the heat from recruits, boosters and fans in the 96 or so hours since Carroll’s possible departure was first rumoured. Multiple USC commits had given hints or outright said that they would reconsider their college choices after learning of the change at the top.
National Signing Day is Feb. 3, and in the two or three weeks prior, recruiting is more important than at any other point during the year.
But putting all of Kiffin’s transgressions aside, the 34-year-old still has a reputation as a tireless, successful recruiter. He put together what was widely termed a top-25 recruiting class in fewer than 70 days on the job with the Volunteers.
That fact — and the fact that many players currently committed to Tennessee could follow Kiffin to USC — should quell many a fan’s doubts for the time being.
At today’s press conference in the Heritage Hall Varsity Lounge, Garrett and Kiffin will take to the mic in what will surely be a sight to be seen.
And they will face many questions.
Seriously, mike garrett just shot USC in the foot with this lousy hire. Of course, many coaches, ranging from the Oregon State coach to Jack Del Rio did not want this job. Heck, even Norm Chow avoided lame kiffin with all his might because he was the jerk who made trouble to Chow back in 2004.  I am one of the few Trojan alums who is skeptical of the hire of lame kiffin, and would like mike garrett to be fired! With president Steve Sample gone, I hope there will be a new USC president who will make SC a better academic institute.
USC won the battle but will lose the war with this one.
I love that we’re already being investigated by the NCAA, and we bring in a coach who can’t keep his foot out of his mouth and even managed to committ a few new NCAA violations as soon as we hired him by calling UT recruits – he left voicemails for God’s sake! This is a horrible decision and he’s only going to screw us over.
Haha, you don’t have to worry about him bolting for the NFL – he’s not good enough, he already tried! Gooo Raiders! He has an overall losing record, and his dad is the best thing about him – Mike Garrett needs his head examined!! He’ll be out of here in 2 years, but b/c we fire him.
I am skeptical of lane kiffing being a good HC for us Trojans. I am very disappointed with the selection by mike garrett. Perhaps people at USC should be questioning if mike garrett is competent enought to be our athletic director. I sure hope that lane kiffing does not bolt for another college or the NFL in a couple of years. I really wish that Norm Chow would have been selected to be the headcoach. And Norm Chow working hand in hand with kiffin? Didn’t the two of them argue and not get along while NC was still at USC?

Inspired by Rudy Klappers top 10 albums of 2009 (the entire top 20 is posted online!), I decided to once and for all clean off last year’s musical slate with a best SONGS of 2009. And surprise! None of the songs are on albums from Klapper’s list, so get over to iTunes and check these babies out.
Micachu and the Shapes- “Golden Phone”
It was hard to choose which song off Micachu’s debut album Jewellry would make the Best Songs list, but “Golden Phone” wins as it aptly demonstrates the Brooklyn-via-England band’s ability to mash up sounds from miniature guitars and household appliances to make an ear-tickling organized mess. Front-woman Mica Levi’s androgynous voice lends a soothing edge to the looping instrument sounds and ambient noises, most of which are played in reverse (and then forward) throughout the album.
 
Fool’s Gold – “Surprise Hotel”
A rotating band of Silverlake hipsters glued together by its Hebrew bi-lingual frontman, Fool’s Gold is America’s answer to Saharan nomads Tinariwen. With upwards of 10 people on stage per show and a museum’s-worth of African drums, the band’s debut single “Surprise Hotel” is a mix of electric guitars and tribal beats that makes the Early Man in all of us want to start a harvest dance.
 Fool’s Gold-“Surprise Hotel (Micachu Remix)”
Imagine the last two blended together in a caucophony of tribal beats and vacuum cleaner ambient sounds that defies all laws of physics and acceptable music.
 Scott H. Biram—“Still Drunk, Still Crazy, Still Blue”
It took three years for one-man band Scott Biram to release his 2009 album Lost Forever/Somewhere Gone and when he finally did, it was  somber and ballad-heavy, a turnaround for the dirty blues revivalist who built his career on raucous, alcohol-fueled hollerin’ songs. “Still Drunk, Still Crazy, Still Blue” is Biram’s intelligent blues-writing trying to cope with a devastating breakup and the result is enough to make up for the lack of his typical hoe-down energy.
 Crystal Antlers-“Until the Sun Dies (Part 1)”
This song was technically released on a limited 7” back in 2008, but the Long Beach psych-rock band re-recorded the jam for their debut full-length album (and Touch and Go Records’ last new release), Tentacles, which came out in March of ’09. Although it’s not as mainstream-friendly as the record’s single “Andrew,” “Until the Sun Dies (Part 1)” is a better representation of the Antlers’ signature sound: a blend of 70s dark-psych and leftover-grunge backed by a fitful Echoplex keyboard and an extra percussionist nicknamed “Sexual Chocolate.”
 Yeasayer – “Ambling Alp”
Bands that have no other genre are usually billed as “experimental,” but Yeasayer’s newest song shows that the Brooklyn band is not only experimenting, but they’re blowing up the lab. Taking 60s classic rock elements and tear it apart with atypical instrumentation, electronic overtones and a heaping dose of weirdo-pop psychedelia, “Ambling Alp” is the first single from the yet-to-be-released album Odd Blood and if you were dancing through the wilderness in a dream, this would be the soundtrack.
This is a great list. If you’re interested, our company produced the video for Scott’s Still Drunk, Still Crazy, Still Blue. You can take a look at it here: http://vimeo.com/6936903.  Thanks.

Less than 48 hours removed from losing their coach of the last nine seasons, USC announced Lane Kiffin will be the next Trojan coach Tuesday night.
Kiffin, who worked under former coach Pete Carroll as both a receivers coach and an offensive coordinator, spent last season as the University of Tennessee’s football coach.
Kiffin will install an entirely new staff to work with him, which, according to ESPN, could include  Norm Chow, who was the offensive coordinator at USC before Kiffin ascended to his position. After leaving USC, Chow was hired by the Tennessee Titans to take the same position with the Titans. Chow spent three seasons working there and was then hired by Rick Neuheisel to be the offensive coordinator at UCLA.

The announcement came just hours after the university began its official search for a replacement for Carroll, who announced his resignation on Monday afternoon.
Kiffin addressed the Tennessee media late Monday night after the announcement broke.
Kiffin made it clear during his statement that the job as USC coach was the only job worth leaving his post at Tennessee.
After his time as a coordinator at USC, Kiffin was hired to be the coach of the NFL Oakland Raiders. Kiffin’s tenure in Oakland was short-lived, however, as he and owner Al Davis clashed over a variety of team decisions. After less than two seasons at the helm of the Raiders, Davis dismissed Kiffin from his position after Kiffin compiled a 5-15 record.
Kiffin was then hired by Tennessee to replace Phillip Fulmer in late 2008 and had moderate success with the Volunteers during the 2009 season, leading the Vols to a 7-6 record and a berth in the Chick-fil-A Bowl.
Kiffin, however, was a lightning rod at Tennessee, bringing controversy with him to the school. The program was cited for a variety of NCAA rule violations during Kiffin’s 14 months at the school.
Althletic Director Mike Garrett released a statement on Tuesday night announcing the decision.
“We are really excited to welcome Lane Kiffin back to USC,” Garrett said in the statement. “He has a coaching background both in the pros and in the best collegiate conferences. He has a great command of the X’s and O’s. He is familiar with the Trojan landscape and will be a great representative of our university.”
Kiffin will also bring a large contingent of coaches from Tennessee to fill out his staff at USC, including defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin (who is his father) and assistant coach Ed Orgeron.
The elder Kiffin is best known for his time in the NFL, where he was one of the engineers behind the success of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers earlier this decade. His “Tampa 2” defensive scheme became a widely implemented system in the pros and in college.
Orgeron, who is also a former Trojan assistant coach, joined Kiffin in Tennessee after a stint as the coach of the University of Mississippi and was integral to Tennessee’s highly ranked 2010 recruiting class.
Haha, we’re soooo excited, that’s why we offered it to everyone else first!

Few things are more sinister than doughnuts. They may be soft and fluffy, but nix the glaze and creamy filling and doughnuts are really just a piece of deep-fried cake.
At least the deep-fried Snickers bar was honest about it. 
Those looking for an alternative to sugary-sweet breakfast pastries, however, could end up dealing with diet foods that can be almost as terrible. With a chemistry set for an ingredients list and a taste somewhere between cardboard and hand cream, most diet desserts fall criminally short of their full-fat counterparts.
Those who despair of ever having their cake and eating it too, meet Holey Donuts!. These New York–based little creations are a great way to satisfy a doughnut craving without the deep-fried aftertaste or the diet food dry mouth.
Holey Donuts are handmade and never touch a deep fryer. Although the exact cooking method is a well-guarded company secret, the company’s founder, Frank Dilullo, spent time in the family’s doughnut business before developing a new way of making them — one that left him with low-fat, far healthier doughnuts.
“[A doughnut] doesn’t have to be this sinful treat you have once a month and feel bad about,” said Brook Baskin, Holey Donuts’ head of customer care. “What makes our doughnuts different is we use all the same doughnut ingredients as everyone else, we just cook them a different way.”
Currently, Holey Donuts come in four basic varieties: traditional ring doughnuts, doughnut holes, filled doughnuts and cinnamon buns. The filled doughnuts have the widest variety of flavors — from lemon graham cracker to coconut cream pie — but the results of Dilullo’s recipe are in the numbers.
For a quick comparison, a Chocolate Crumb Holey Donut has three grams of fat, nine grams of sugar and 149 calories. Its mainstream twin, a Krispy Kreme Chocolate Iced Glazed doughnut, has 12 grams of fat, 21 grams of sugar and 250 calories.
“We’re trying to bring to people the best-tasting doughnuts in the world, ones that people can eat without worrying about putting so much fat into their bodies,” Baskin said.
Unlike Weight Watchers and other diet food systems that use miniscule portions to get away with low numbers, Holey Donuts are full-sized and, as such, don’t eliminate the fat, sugar and calories of traditional doughnuts as much as reduce it to a manageable level.
“Frank wasn’t really trying to create a diet product, he was trying to create a doughnut that happens to have a lot less fat and calories,” Baskin said. “That’s why we get such rave reviews from our customers — people are so used to low-fat or lower calorie foods tasting like cardboard.”
Make no mistake, then; Holey Donuts are healthier doughnuts, not “healthy doughnuts.” Some of the fillings have high fructose corn syrup, but at least they don’t fall back on taste-deadening artificial sweeteners or fat substitutes. Through retooling the traditional doughnut recipe, Holey Donuts have produced an authentic, yet far more sensible doughnut, one that might put off zealous health nuts, but will please those just looking for a lighter alternative.
“The company has taken off in the last year,” Baskin said. “We went on QVC and sold about $30,000 worth of doughnuts in six minutes.”
Holey Donuts are shipped to customers (and Daily Trojan food columnists) in a box of dry ice. To achieve doughnut goodness, however, a 20-second stint in the microwave is recommended. Shining in half-melted chocolate, my Chocolate Crumb awaited its doom.
It was surprise at first bite. Somehow, this slim little creature tastes freakishly similar to its fried cousins, and the texture is spot on. Fried dough has a unique taste that Holey Donuts cannot quite mimic, but its donuts do come close.
For all its doppelganger glory, my heart was not smitten. The Chocolate Crumb tasted just like a regular doughnut — not an amazing doughnut, not a bad doughnut, just a doughnut. Some might be happy with just getting the taste and texture right, but I say no excuses.
Then I tried one of the filled doughnuts, the Boston Cream Oreo Cookie. A big puff of doughy goodness, swathed in vanilla and Oreo crumbles, the doughnut dripped with tangy-sweet cream filling and my mouth knew bliss.
As for the cinnamon buns, these bad boys trump any concoction from the Ralph’s bakery, and with only 240 calories, it’s a great alternative to a hulking food court Cinnabon.
Though delicious, Holey Donuts are not perfect. Because they lack much fat and undergo freezing, these things dry out fast. After microwaving, they need to be eaten quickly, meaning no leisurely breakfasts or sneaking one into the library.
The second problem is getting ahold of them. Because you can only order them online with a minimum purchase of three boxes, they are not a cheap treat. Each box of six is around $11.95, making a minimum order $35.85. And because they are frozen, shipping can run as much as $50 — though they will last a long time in the freezer. The company soon hopes to open actual Holey Donuts stores as well as reduce shipping costs. But at the moment, Holey Donuts are high-rolling desserts.
Because they are not health food, Holey Donuts do not taste like health food. And that’s a good thing — in whatever their form, doughnuts are treats. To make them commonplace, that bite into chewy dough and the burst of warm cherry filling would be far less satisfying, low-fat or not.

I am a big shot at a hedge fund, but I have no problem saying that I love love fat donuts.
Me and the boys will definitely have to try these donuts, I mean what else is there to do in Harisburg, PA
Those donuts are mmmm mmm good.  That Baskin guy really sounds like he knows what he is talking about oo

With an exploding underground art movement centered around Eastside areas, such as Silver Lake and Echo Park, many local bands have avoided playing the traditionally more mainstream Sunset Strip in the West.

But as displayed throughout the Viper Room’s “10 Days of 2010” concert series, some of the city’s most popular Eastside acts can hold their own against the fabled Strip’s rocking reputation.
Last Friday’s show, for example, — which, keeping with the number theme, cost only $10 — was like Los Angeles’ underground-music peacock fanning its pop-rock plumage. The KROQ promotional van was parked outside, and the cocktail waitresses were top-heavy and under-dressed, but the Happy Hollows, Gangi, Useless Keys and the Soft Hands took over the infamous venue like it was a free Monday night show at Spaceland.
With all of the aesthetic requirements for an Eastside band fulfilled (dreamy singer, petite and brooding female bass player, etc.), Useless Keys opened the show with its catchy, Led Zepplin-y jam sessions. Although generic-sounding guitar wailing crept in a few times and several songs evoked drug-related cartoon nightmares, Useless Keys was, in the end, more impressive than unnerving.
Using the night as an excuse to emerge from recording hibernation, the L.A.-via-New York experimental-folk duo Gangi made the most of its short set to showcase a cross section of its sonic abilities. Fronted by sometime-DJ and perpetual sample-maker Matt Gangi and supported by newly added bass player Oliver Hild, the band utilized every keyboard, guitar and synthesizer on stage — of which there were many — to create their masterpieces.
In addition to stripping down to traditional instrumentation for its newly written tunes, Gangi used synthesized keyboard notes, pre-programmed beats and looped sounds from a pedal board-type array to add texture to older, rawer songs.

Throughout the frontline changes, however, new drummer Eric Chramosta’s impressively technical skin-hitting remained constant. Never content with a 4/4 time signature, Chramosta pounds through the heart of the band’s dreamscapes like Zach Hill from spastic Sacramento math-rock band Hella. His drumming style is refreshing in general, but, when placed behind a similarly complex tangle of memorable Gangi jams, it’s impossible not to get sucked in.
With an energetic post-punk repertoire and stage charisma to match, headliners The Happy Hollows proved to be the most universally appealing of the Eastside lineup. The Hollows’ technical skills and catchy riffs pleased not only its group of front-row regulars but even the large number of until-now confused male KROQ listeners — identified by their trucker hats and flip flops — who stumbled into the show through effective radio promotion.
It might also help that singer/guitarist Sarah Negahdari is an amazing performer, not just with guitar playing — which sometimes finds both her hands dancing on the fretboard — or singing — which often drifts into heavy panting and even meow-ing — but also with an adorably bipolar stage persona that hangs somewhere between cute, sexy and intense.
Between songs, Negahdari is almost unbearably nice. Emanating shy-girl sweetness, she wears an ear-to-ear Christmas-morning smile and genuinely thanks the audience for coming as if it were her wedding day. But when playing her guitar, Negahdari transforms from the meek girl behind the microphone to the unpredictable front woman of The Happy Hallows.
With her mind lost in music, she plays: Negahdari’s body fitfully flails around the stage during fierce moments and goes into a stoic, religious-like trance for softer ones. Swinging around sweat-filled hair one minute and politely tossing her pick into the audience the next, her energy evokes a more innocent, less ostentatious version of Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O if she took lessons from Grace Slick and a Kewpie doll.
Despite memorable sets by the other bands on the bill, of all the “locals only” acts playing the Viper Room that night, The Happy Hollows and its three-piece pop-rock beats had the most widespread appeal. Their upbeat ’90s alt-rock throwbacks effortlessly embraced the culturally diverse music listeners in attendance and had the entire Viper Room smiling as wide as Negahdari’s mid-song grins.
When “East meets West” in the Los Angeles’ music scene, good things are bound to happen.

If you’re in need of background music for your next vegan barbecue with your American Apparel-clad hipster friends, Nana Grizol’s Ruth would be a good candidate. It would fit in seamlessly on your “Indie” playlist, and don’t worry —  no song is so fast it makes you bob your head to the point of choking on your soyaki burger or so slow it causes a narcoleptic slip into your ironically placed kiddie pool.

Not to insult Nana Grizol, but its sophomore follow-up to 2008’s rawer and punkier Love It Love It is hardly groundbreaking in the indie-rock landscape.
Perhaps their lack of ingenuity stems from their connection to the Elephant 6 collective, the exclusive Athens, Ga.-based posse of such indie music gods as Neutral Milk Hotel and Of Montreal. Many members of the collective live together on the Orange Twin Conservation Community, and, as a result, there is much crossover between the bands. In fact, two members of Neutral Milk Hotel are in Nana Grizol, and the various Elephant 6 bands often tour together.
Whether fair or not, you can’t help but compare Nana Grizol to their tusked counterparts, and in doing so find them extremely derivative and contrived. Lead singer and songwriter Theo Hilton’s determination to sing off-key in a nasally sort of way is distracting from the sometimes interesting horn and guitar parts, and listeners appreciate when he is joined in by others — specifically the female voice — all the more.
Nevertheless, it’s virtually impossible to listen to the album without bopping along at some point. You wonder if Hilton is suffering from ADD or lack of inspiration, because more than half the songs run under three minutes — hardly enough time for any epic greatness to unfold, though this does mean that the more lifeless songs are over quickly (perhaps mercifully).
But Ruth can still be enjoyable as long as you know what to expect. “Cynicism,” a slow, quiet, melodious mix of guitar and horns begins the jaunt into indie-rock territory, though it’s hardly representative of things to come. The subsequent “Galaxies” and “Black Box” are the quintessential head-boppers with a raw, crunchy guitar, simple but catchy drumbeat and lyrics easy enough to warrant a sing-along.
It’s when Hilton only presents his lackluster lyrics and melancholy guitar sounds that you are tempted to turn to Death Cab for Cutie for a complete serving of despondence. But most of the songs are fun and, for the most part, lack the pretentiousness of similar bands. Ruth ends with “Sands,” a well-composed song lasting almost five minutes, showing that perhaps Nana Grizol has better things to come if they could only escape the collective and venture out on its own.

Amid the number of vampire films emerging from the recent craze, it has been hard to find a true vampire story. While vampire movies released lately do pertain to blood-sucking creatures, they lean toward one of two ends of the vampire myth spectrum.
On one end of the spectrum are the Anne Rice and Twilight vampires, where sappy romance rules and horror is gone. On the other are the monstrous, dehumanizing vampires of 30 Days of Night and Blade, where mysticism and romance is cast aside for gore, deadly viruses and more gore.

That is not to say these tales don’t provide good stories but, compared with the more traditionally-haunting, suspenseful vampire stories — like Carmilla and Dracula — they are inferior.
This brings us to Daybreakers.
Written and directed by Michael and Peter Spierig, Daybreakers falls on the science-fiction horror end of the aforementioned vampire-myth spectrum. Set in modern-day society, the movie supposes that vampirism spread across the world, leaving humans as a rapidly dwindling minority.
Ten years later, however, blood supplies begin dwindling and vampires face extinction as they start mutating into Nosferatu-like subsiders.
Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is the head researcher looking for a blood substitute for Bromley-Marks, a megacorporation specializing in the blood industry and chaired by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill).
Dissatisfied with the condition of society and sympathizing with the humans, Dalton looks for a way to help the hunted minority, which he soon finds in the miraculously cured ex-vampire Elvis (Willem Dafoe).
Despite its science fiction premise, Daybreakers is not a standard vampire horror film. With its apocalyptic overtones and fatalistic view on society, it is reminiscent of 2006’s Children of Men ­— except with vampires. The movie excels at creating a futuristic 2019: cars are modified for “daytime driving” with UV filters and cameras to see the road, while coffee shops offer blood-infused lattes to the masses (“20 percent real human blood,” the signs read).
Daybreakers also looks at the motives people had for becoming vampires — namely immortality — and shows the downsides to that decision with teenage vampires commiting suicide by sunlight rather than going on trapped in a body that doesn’t age.
The most interesting concept in the film is the treatment of blood as a natural resource. In many ways, Daybreakers is an allegory for the haste and overuse humans have shown with our own natural resources. To the filmmaker’s credit, however, the metaphor is handled subtly and is very effective.
News reports of blood starvation in the third world and increased hording of blood haunt the film, adding to the sense of doom. The brief glimpses of the sub-siders are particularly chilling.
Weta Workshop, the team behind the visual effects in The Lord of the Rings and District 9, lent the somewhat low-budget film ­— it was made for $21 million, $9 million less than District 9 — impressive designs and prosthetics. The CGI used in the film, however, is disappointing, with many of the vampire deaths spoiled by ineffective graphics.
The Spierig brothers’ directing is solid for most of the film and even excellent in the world-building segments. But when it comes to drama and action scenes, the film falls apart. Most of the fights — with overdone and somewhat crude effects — are laughable at best.
Similarly, the scene showcasing Elvis’ recovery comes across as slapstick, rather than dramatic. An early scene involving a test on Dalton’s blood substitute should have been chilling and effective, but was instead hilarious, with over-the-top blood spatters and comedic pauses. All that was missing was a laugh track.
Meanwhile, the acting is hit or miss. Hawke presents a subdued performance, giving Dalton a disconnected, pitiable air, and making him the highlight of the cast. Neill’s refined, patrician approach to Bromley’s character thankfully avoids overacting and keeps the character from becoming cliché.
Not so lucky is Dafoe, whose character is given awful lines. Compared to Dafoe’s work in the excellent vampire film Shadow of the Vampire, it seems he decided to forgo seriousness and instead gave his character a wonderfully stereotypical redneck accent and swagger.
Still, the actors, script and directors managed to keep the film interesting, at least until the ending. For all the wonderful buildup the first 80 minutes provided, the climax of Daybreakers is disappointing and, once again, comically violent.
It’s a shame, really. The most engaging concepts in the film — the intriguing futuristic society and the consequences of a cure for vampirism — get tossed out the window for a gory finale.
For fans of the grittier, science-based vampire genre, Daybreakers presents a unique and creative look at what would happen in the aftermath of a vampire outbreak and displays thoughtful consequences to trivial aspects of the myth. The poor handling of the dramatic action scenes in the film, however, effectively kills any of the tension it builds up, and the Spierig brothers seemed to throw out their complex world for cliché action in the end.
