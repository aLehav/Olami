It appears that the only slam dunks coming from USC these days are at the hands of superstar freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu, and while I deeply admire the way that USC basketball has quietly turned into a pacific powerhouse this season, it’s clear that its football counterparts can hardly get an easy win with Trojan fans lately.
As the dust settled and celebrations ceased after the Trojan basketball team’s dramatic 21-point comeback win over a tough Stanford team at Galen Center last Saturday, reports emerged regarding USC’s defensive coordinator search. Weeks after parting ways with Clancy Pendergast following a 49-24 drubbing at the hands of a mediocre Iowa Hawkeyes offense in the Holiday Bowl, the Trojans are now expected to hire Todd Orlando as their next defensive coordinator.
Dismissed earlier in the offseason by Tom Herman in an attempt to rebuild the Longhorn coaching staff in Texas, Orlando landed a spot as the linebackers coach/assistant head coach at Texas Tech before reports arose of his interest in USC. 
After publicly failing to lure Los Angeles Rams linebackers coach and former USC assistant Joe Barry to the coordinator job, USC quickly pivoted to Orlando with the hopes of injecting new life into the defense and bringing a new face to a battered Trojan recruiting effort.
Though he’s certainly not the first choice of many armchair athletic directors — former Seahawks defensive coordinator and Trojan alum Kris Richard was nothing if not the fan favorite — Orlando ultimately appears as another suspect coaching decision for a staff rife with mediocrity and second guessing.
Working as a defensive coordinator at five schools over the past 15 years, Orlando has overseen a fairly boom-or-bust slate of defensive units. According to Bill Connelly’s SP+ rankings, a system by which all FBS units are equally rated based on opponents and game flow to judge defensive efficiency, Orlando has had seven teams finish in the top 27 while six units clocked in at 53rd or worse. 
Despite gaining a reputation for strong initial coaching performances during year one, his defenses have seen a great deal of regression. At Texas, Todd watched as a unit that dominated the Trojans last September and finished that season as the 14th best defense in the nation crumbled due to injury and inflexibility and fell to 68th at the time of his firing in 2019.
Possibly the most troubling aspect of the Orlando hiring, however, is the eerie similarities he shares with the departed Pendergast. One of the most important factors in Clancy’s firing was a perceived lack of flexibility and inability to properly develop defensive talent. Running a converted 3-4 defense, Pendergast relied heavily on skilled pass rushers such as Uchenna Nwosu and Porter Gustin, but when the proverbial pass rushing well ran dry, Pendergast did little to adjust. 
The Trojan defense, among other issues, has become a middle-of-the-road pass rushing team despite the aggressive approach. Considering the youth and inexperience of the defensive backfield for USC in 2019, this was a death knell. 
On top of all of this, Pendergast’s lack of a grip on recruiting has caused talented local recruits in recent years to slip through the hands of the Trojans, such as current Oregon defensive lineman and former top-ranked recruit Kayvon Thibodeaux and incoming LSU defensive back Elias Ricks among others.
In many ways, Orlando mirrored this behavior and reputation at Texas. According to Anwar Richardson, beat writer for the Longhorns Rivals site, “Todd Orlando didn’t adjust his defensive scheme to suit the talent, players were not developed, and he was not a high-level recruiter.” 
In the simplest terms, this would appear to check every box of what the Trojans should theoretically be avoiding in a Pendergast replacement.
That said, it is difficult to argue the merits of fresh blood. For as much as stability, consistency and continuity are great to have in theory, this is a time of upheaval at USC. No one wants a constantly rotating door, but it is clear that the old guard of Heritage Hall is being slowly and painfully churned out in favor of an era of transparency, clarity and — as President Carol Folt and Athletic Director Mike Bohn often point to — integrity.
If anything can be sure, the USC fanbase is not sold. As is the case with pretty much anything the Trojans do these days, seeing is believing. 
Until then, the easy scores will remain on the hardwood.

The No. 1 USC women’s water polo team will begin its search for another national title with opening tilts against California Baptist and Concordia at the CBU Mini Invitational Saturday. 
After  finishing 2019 with a nail-biting 1-point loss to Stanford in the NCAA Championship match, USC will have to continue its historic winning ways to maintain the No. 1 preseason ranking in the coaches poll ahead of MPSF rivals like No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Stanford and No. 4 California. 
“I think this is the resilience, [the] determination of the team, the culture and the program that we stand for,” head coach Marko Pintaric said. “And I didn’t see things change even though our senior class graduated. Even though we didn’t win a national championship, we didn’t achieve our goal … we just started a new season, exact same goals, exact same ideas to keep building the same culture.”
The team will have to accommodate the loss of the four Trojans taking the season off to join their respective countries’ 2020 Olympic campaigns. 
But even with sophomore driver Alejandra Aznar, junior driver Paige Hauschild, senior utility Maud Megens and sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns sitting out, Pintaric has seen the remaining players step up to fill the gaps.
“We are lucky that our senior group is again very, very much team-oriented,” Pintaric said. “They’re great leaders, they’re [the] coaches’ voice in the locker room, same as we had on the boys’ side. And I’m very pleased as a coach and happy and lucky.”
The returning group will consist of All-American senior drivers Denise Mammolito and Kelsey McIntosh, who racked up 29 and 34 goals last season, respectively. Along with MPSF All-Newcomer sophomore utility Bayley Weber, sophomore utility Mireia Guiral and sophomore driver Grace Tehaney will be the returning players from last year’s NCAA title match against Stanford. 
All three tallied 20 or more goals last season over 20, 18 and 14 games, respectively. 
Although the team faces an additional loss with goalie Amanda Longan having graduated this past year, there is no shortage of talented players that have been working to fill her place. Redshirt junior Holly Parker is the most senior of the goalie group and tallied 8.2 saves per game over 13 appearances last season. 
After redshirting her first season, freshman Erin Tharp will aim to get some time in the cage along with freshmen Carolyne Stern and Avrey Larson. 
The group will form the backbone of the defensive effort that has shaped much of USC’s philosophy. 
“For us, it’s always defense and we try to be that team,” Pintaric said. “Amanda graduated, [an] All-American goalie. So, [Parker], you know, she’s stepping into a role. A couple of younger goalies [are] pushing her under and everything is going backward from defense into offense.”
This weekend and the majority of February will be filled with invitational games, as the Trojans will head to Riverside, San Diego and Irvine for the CBU, Triton and Barbara Kalbus Invitationals. Pintaric said other games will be added to bulk up the team’s schedule before facing more of its ranked rivals later in March and April. 
“We are adding more games as we go,” Pintaric said. “As you know, same as with the boy’s season, the situation we found ourselves [in] didn’t allow us to work on a schedule to fill up potentials like in the past.” 
USC’s opening match against Cal Baptist Saturday at 12:45 p.m. will kick off what looks to be a promising season for the Trojans.

In what will be its biggest test so far this season, the USC men’s basketball team is preparing to take on the No. 12 Oregon Ducks in Eugene, Ore. 
The Trojans are coming off their most impressive win of the season against Stanford, while Oregon is coming off a comeback win of its own against Washington.
Both teams have 15 overall wins and four conference wins on the season. USC is currently in first place in the Pac-12, but Oregon is the highest-ranked team in the conference and USC remains unranked nationally.
“Big game — I’m a freshman — Oregon’s definitely one of the spots I have wanted to play at,” freshman forward Isaiah Mobley said. “I heard it’s a crazy environment. They’re a top-ranked team in the country right now, and I think we’re starting to roll … so I think if we execute and work hard we can beat anyone.”
Oregon has been dominant at home — not losing a single game at the Matthew Knight Arena — but that does not mean every game has come easy. The Ducks nearly lost to the Arizona Wildcats earlier this month in a 74-73 overtime battle, but as has been the case often this year, senior guard Payton Pritchard led the Ducks to another victory.
Pritchard is one player the Trojans have to keep in check if they’ll have any chance of winning. The possible front-runner for National Player of the Year has been dominating college basketball all season, averaging nearly 20 points and 5.7 assists on 41.2% 3-point shooting and 48.7% overall from the field.
“Oregon, they are an experienced team. They have some older guys, really good point guard Payton Pritchard and [a] couple good young big men,” Mobley said. “But I think we’re extremely talented too.”
A statement win against the Ducks would more than likely thrust USC into the national spotlight. The Trojans, who have not made the NCAA Tournament since 2017, are on track to finish the season better than that year, when they advanced to the Round of 32.
Head coach Andy Enfield’s Trojans have been hot of late. USC currently has a three-game winning streak, which includes two dominant wins against UCLA and UC Berkeley and a 21-point comeback win against Stanford. USC has won nine of its last 10 overall.
Much of this success can be attributed to contributions from USC’s youth. Sophomore guard Elijah Weaver, who scored the game-tying 3-pointer against Stanford to force overtime, has shot over 40% from the field in his last three games for a combined 27 points off the bench.
Mobley said USC’s coaching staff has helped him and the team’s younger players improve recently.
“Knowing where to be at all points on offense and defense, so if I need to be in a certain position at a certain point in the game, I know better now to be there,” Mobley said. “[The coaches] know we’re young so they know we’re going to make mistakes.”
If USC has any hope of beating one of the best teams in the country, it will have to rely on Weaver, Mobley and the rest of its roster to play cohesively. 
USC also has to do a better job of protecting the ball, as it has turned it over 15.2 times per game this season — compared to 12.2 a game for Oregon.
The Trojans and Ducks will tip off at 8 p.m. Thursday on ESPNU.

Ahead of this weekend’s Grammy awards, the Academy’s Downtown Los Angeles GRAMMY Museum L.A. Live is now featuring exclusive pieces of Amy Winehouse’s wardrobe, along with other memorabilia, in celebration of the star’s legacy. The museum kicked off its GRAMMY Week celebration with a panel and launch party of “Beyond Black: The Style of Amy Winehouse.” 
Winehouse’s friend Catriona Gourlay and London-based costume designer Naomi Parry spoke on the panel, which was moderated by music journalist Eve Barlow. The event was the first time Gourlay spoke publicly about her friendship with the artist.
During the panel discussion, Parry spoke on how Winehouse’s vintage-leaning style reflected her humble attitude and ability to connect with those around her.
“She wasn’t about how expensive something was,” Parry said. “And she wasn’t afraid to wear the same dress twice, three times, even four times.” 
Parry, whose career began at 19 years old when she met Winehouse, designed a clothing line for the artist’s canceled 2011 tour, which is featured in the exhibit along with her other pieces. 
GRAMMY Museum Chief Operating Officer Rita George said the museum has been planning the exhibit for over two years and that the final arrangements fell into place in five weeks over the winter holidays.
“A lot of times, when it is an exhibit about a star who’s deceased, you have to earn the trust of their family,” George said. “Because now we’re talking about a legacy. We’re talking about somebody who can’t stand up and talk for themselves.” 
Panelists Gourlay and Parry also discussed how their relationships were affected by her rising fame. Gourlay said that the two were forced to fend off  paparazzi on the street on a regular basis.
“Because of everything that was going on with her in terms of press, people would go to say not very nice things [to her] down the street to try and get a reaction so [someone] could get a picture so that they could sell up to the photo agency for a lot of money,” Gourlay said. “And some of the stuff that people used to say to the street was so savage and horrible to watch. And that did affect our friendship because I think if anything it just made me so protective of her because I didn’t want her to have to deal with that on a daily basis.”
The “Beyond Black” panel also explored the emotional highs Gourlay and Parry shared with Winehouse during her rising music career. When asked about Parry’s  favorite piece in the collection, she said that all of the items in the display hall reminded her of how she felt working for her friend.
“It’s really difficult to pick one piece out because most of the stuff in there I’ve worked with. So each thing has got a memory for me at that particular time,” Parry said. “The yellow Preen dress is quite a big one because it is one of the first jobs I did with her. It was before it went mental and she became, because I mean after that she was just suddenly a superstar … That was kind of moment I really felt like she came up, she’s like, ‘This is me now.’ Like, ‘This is Back to Black and this is how I dress now’.”
Once the Los Angeles exhibit ends, the collection will go to London, Chile and Ireland. Then the items will be auctioned off, with the proceeds going to the Amy Winehouse Foundation, a charity that works to prevent alcohol and drug misuse among youth.
George hopes that students will visit the installation because they can help carry the memory of Winehouse.
“[We] want to educate and hopefully inspire visitors for every age group,” George said. “I think you realize that you know more of her music or relate to her influences more than you might think. And I think it’s finding there’s something relatable about Amy.”

Some know her as the confident 17-year-old who was one of the top 32 contestants on “The Voice” in 2018. Others know her as the wildly talented member of the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts Vocal Jazz Ensemble, where she received the Top Artist Award for three consecutive years at the Next Generation Jazz Festival. 
Jordyn Simone knows herself as an artist that sings a fusion of R&B and a musician that seeks to defy categorization. 
“I genuinely feel like I am a combination of a lot of genres,” said Simone, a sophomore majoring in popular music. “Someone would, of course, categorize me as an R&B artist, but I have gotten so much influence from rock music and jazz. I’m trying to make a new-age version of R&B.”
With her stint on “The Voice” and high school singing career behind her, Simone said her biggest career goal is not to be the best singer but to be the most vulnerable in her work. 
“There’s a level of authenticity and genuineness that I want in my music that I didn’t realize I even cared about on ‘The Voice’ because I was just singing covers,” she said. 
Simone’s most recent single, “Adrenaline,” which mixes elements of pop and R&B, was released Jan. 10. on Spotify, Apple Music and SoundCloud. Simone described the song as a composition of the sweet and simple possibilities of newfound love, the “butterfly phase,” and lust. 
“It’s really easy to write in depth about serious topics like love and relationships, hate and anger,” Simone said. “It’s easy to write into those intense emotions, but I wanted to create a light-hearted song about love.”
Love is not only a theme in her music, but it’s also what continues to guide Simone’s growth as an artist. More than anything, Simone admits that she is “trying to fall in love with Jordyn Simone as the artist.” 
Simone points to artists like Ari Lennox, Lauryn Hill, Anderson .Paak, Christina Aguilera and Jill Scott as her influences. However, she attributes the majority of her musical prowess to her jazz-enthused father and piano-playing mother. She describes her dad as the person who taught her how to “fall in love and cherish the art of music” and her mom as her “businesswoman” who helps manage her career. 
However, despite her long-lived passion for music, she has mixed feelings about the industry as a whole. 
“The music industry is oversaturated,” she said. “So many people can put music out because of the availability, so it’s hard to decide what’s good anymore and what’s just popular. However, there are a lot of blessings in how available everything is in the industry. I can record ‘Adrenaline’ in my friend’s closet and have someone mix and master it and I can put it out on all platforms and reach people I have never met in my life. From that perspective, I’m really grateful because I am an independent artist.” 
As for her time at USC, Simone sees it as an opportunity that has enabled her to build a network of producers, fellow musicians and creators that can help her further her career.
“Most of the producers that I work with are USC production major students,” Simone said. “Most of the visual artists that I work with for my music videos were all USC kids. Past the idea of education, I wouldn’t even be able to do the outside-of-school stuff that I do if it wasn’t for the USC connections or their network that they’ve given me.” 
Next month, Simone will release another single titled “Paradigm.” In March, she plans on hosting a music video release show for the single, which will be accompanied with a live performance.

“Dolittle,” the Universal-backed fantasy film starring Robert Downey Jr. and a slew of high-profile celebrities voicing CGI animals, was given a seemingly-suitable PG rating. So I was rather taken aback when, in a scene more in line with Brazzers than a family-friendly flick, Downey plunges his entire arm up to his shoulder into a dragon’s rectum and removes, among other detritus, a flag, a suit of armor and a pair of bagpipes. 
This movie is a mind-numbing, soul-crushing, spirit-breaking endeavor that will sap you of your will to live and squash your faith in humanity. Watching it is the equivalent of bashing your skull into a wall for an hour and 41 minutes —  both will obliterate the same number of brain cells. 
It’s hard to know where to start when listing the movie’s faults, but for one, the pacing is totally off. The premise of the movie is that Dolittle, along with his horde of furry friends, must go on a wild-goose chase in search of the fabled Eden Tree; the tree bears a panacean fruit that can revive the deathly ill Queen of England. Dolittle and gang bounce from Buckingham Palace to the kingdom of his ex father-in-law King Rassouli, to the mystical faraway island where the tree grows, and absolutely none of these environments are fleshed out or explored in any meaningful way. 
The action is choppy and the transitions abrupt, with scenes haphazardly stitched together. It’s obviously a rushed job, as the editors were working on it up until the bitter end — hardly surprising, as the script was rewritten several times and there were extensive reshoots following poor test screenings. As a result, “Dolittle” has the same energy as a kid pulling an all-nighter, brute-forcing his way through a 3,000-word essay he only began researching yesterday.  
Secondly, the dialogue is lazy, piss-poor and utterly unsalvageable, even by the big-name cast. The menagerie of animals, voiced by Hollywood luminaries such as Emma Thompson, Octavia Spencer and Marion Cotillard, are reduced to tossing off cheap one-liners and insipid wisecracks. It physically pains me to envision these established talents going into the recording booth and being forced to say things like “Teamwork makes the dream work!,” “Snitches get stitches!” and “Vive la France!” Five — five! — people worked on the screenplay, and this is the best they could come up with? Imagine blowing millions of dollars on rendering ultra-realistic animal fur, just to make them say some shit like “I’m too beautiful to die!” 
Finally, principal player Robert Downey Jr. — who’s arguably got enough star power and charisma to at least mildly redeem the movie — instead hammers the final nail in the film’s coffin by electing to put on a bizarre Welsh accent, thus ensuring that every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely indecipherable. If you insist on watching this movie (which I implore you to reconsider), I would suggest at least watching it on a platform that provides subtitles, because, believe me, you will need them. It’s hard to say whether the manic look in Downey’s eyes should be attributed to his acting or to the fact that he’s contractually bound to stay aboard a sinking ship. 
The only favorable thing I can think of to say about “Dolittle” is that the visuals were quite impressive — hardly surprising, as they were overseen by visual effects legend John Dykstra, who invented the Star Wars lightsaber. But Dykstra may not want to include this gig on his long list of credits, considering how it’s on track to become a major flop; so far, it’s grossed $50 million against a production budget of $175 million.
Despite the overwhelmingly negative response from film critics, most have conceded that the movie’s target audience, young children, will still likely enjoy “Dolittle” due to its potty humor and mildly rude language. But is it really necessary to pander to the lowest common denominator? Why must these big studios resort to fart jokes to keep kids entertained? Do they really have such a low estimation of 8-year-olds? Kids are smart — smarter than we give them credit for. Kids deserve better! The best children’s movies have heart and soul, or, barring that, at least some originality. No such merits are anywhere to be found in this miserable movie. 
Leaving the theater, I felt alternately incensed and depressed. It’s quite demoralizing that the people in power, the influential tastemakers who are granted inordinate say over what constitutes art and culture, have decided that “Dolittle” is worthy of our attention and our dollars. 
In conclusion, “Dolittle” is unbelievably stupid. Anyone who has two eyes and a brain should be able to see this film for what it is: vapid, warmed-over drivel that’s a damning indictment of modern filmmaking, in which good, solid storytelling is sacrificed at the altar of aesthetics.

Hey, you. 
If you are reading this, you must be an avid Daily Trojan reader. Or, perhaps you are the spontaneous type, stumbling across this while scrolling through your Twitter feed, enticed by the mention of the Netflix phenomenon “You.” 
In a recent interview with actress Gina Rodriguez, actor Penn Badgley opened up about his portrayal of protagonist Joe Goldberg and commented on the public response to the show, specifically citing the logline on Lifetime as “How far are you willing to go for love?” 
Badgley instead insisted, “To me, it’s ‘how far are we willing to go to forgive an evil white man?’” 
This discussion raises several questions regarding the intersectionality between race and mental health, with the conversation becoming more complex when we consider the public’s romanticization of Goldberg — a mentally ill, probably sociopathic serial killer — as a “hot murderer.” 
Like Badgley has reiterated countless times, these mindsets are not only toxic but also reinforce a twisted logic in an age that strives for equality regardless of race, gender, or able-bodiedness. We must redirect our conversations when considering the intersectionality between mental health and race. How far will we go in overlooking abhorrent behavior to normalize insanity, but also, how far should we go to fully encompass all aspects of the mental health stigma to reduce it?
Looking at the intersectionality between mental illness and race, Goldberg epitomizes the token white sociopath — charming and alluring on the outside, but manipulative and conniving on the inside. Viewers using sex appeal and romantic ideation to permit his devilish behavior is undeniably predictable; it’s not the first time we have seen it happen — it actually parallels the high-profile case of Ted Bundy and his garnering of female fans during his trial back in the 1970s. 
This kind of glamorization, however, does not happen with black men. Instead of being sexualized, they are criminalized.
In fact, black people are 3.5 times more likely to be incarcerated in jail than white people. Furthermore, people of color in the criminal justice system are less likely to be diagnosed with a mental health problem. After all, the Cook County Jail is also America’s largest psychiatric facility, which shows that our current justice system already innately criminalizes mental illness and consequently worsens mental health stigmas. 
Ultimately, these statistics posit that underrepresented groups are disproportionately affected by stigmas. Because they have less access to mental health services, only about 30 percent of African American adults with a mental illness receive treatment every year while an average of 43 percent of all Americans with a mental illness receive treatment. 
This disparity highlights the intrinsic prejudice in our society that paradigmatically overlooks and undermines marginalized groups, while continually exonerating majority groups. And this is not the only instance where it has complicated a progressive movement for equity. The modern feminist movement, for example, is sharply polarized due to the unique struggles that women of color in America face compared to white women. 
If the public’s reaction and perception to Goldberg can teach us anything, we should learn that stigmatization is multi-faceted and more difficult to dwindle than we previously thought. These social issues do not have one-size fits all solutions, and by ignoring the intersectionality and variation within these movements, we inadvertently perpetuate these stigmas. 
By romanticizing Goldberg, we reinforce the racial dichotomy in mental health conversations and undermine insanity. Because of his whiteness, we look past his state of mind and excuse his otherwise unforgivable behavior. Fundamentally, the way in which we frame a white sociopath warrants the need for a reevaluation of how to approach mental health. 
To destigmatize mental health, we must do more than open up the conversation. Sure, we can continue being cognizant of using phrases like “I’m so OCD” and normalize talking about personal experiences, but we have to expand this to the pervasive trends that counteract these efforts. 
We must address discrepancies, like the inequities in how we characterize insanity and approach them from all angles to understand the systemic reasons for why mental health care is worse in marginalized communities, or why our justice system criminalizes those with mental illnesses, especially people of color. With these refined perspectives, we can move away from problematizing psychological thrillers and work toward having more meaningful conversations. 
In the meantime, let’s continue watching “You” while keeping this in mind. We can get a lot more out of it than a mere scare.

In summer 2018, juniors Clara Diogo and Ocean Ronquillo-Morgan realized that the type of USC apparel they wanted could not be found anywhere. 
None of the bookstore apparel combined “hypebeast” style with a personal connection to the USC spirit, and much of the game day apparel directed toward women was overtly feminine and not inclusive of diverse body shapes.
“I have a really curvy body shape,” said Diogo, who is majoring in architecture major. “I wanted to … get to a point where I could make clothes that people like me could wear to game day.”
Noticing this untapped market, Ronquillo-Morgan and Diogo entered the scene with Geistwear, which means spirit wear in German. 
“We were looking at this idea of hypewear, hypebeast clothes, and we didn’t see that in game day,” Diogo said. “Sometimes you just want to wear a sweater and sweatpants, and that’s not a thing that people sell for game day that looks cool, you know?”
The design for their current line is influenced by Kanye West’s “Yeezus” album, and their overall aesthetic draws inspiration from Yeezy, West’s streetwear collaboration with Adidas. 
In 2018, Cathy Ding, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, reached out to Geistwear over Instagram and became its first brand ambassador. She represents its clothing over social media and has helped with pop-up shops on the lawn of her sorority, Alpha Chi Omega.
“Rather than other brands that do USC-based clothing, [Geistwear has] more elaborate designs, and I found that their apparel kind of spoke to my sense of fashion just as much as it did to my school spirit,” Ding said. “I feel like I could wear it around more, it’s more suitable for everyday wear and it’s more representative of my fashion style and I know a lot of others on this campus’ fashion style.”
Jenny Back, a freshman majoring in business administration, was drawn to the brand for similar reasons, which led her to work with Geistwear for a consulting class project. After providing feedback for Geistwear, she said she was invited to join the team as a brand ambassador. 
“In my mind there’s only two other places where you can get game day merch: the bookstore and the Anti Bruin Trojan Club,” Back said. “Geistwear definitely is very unique in the sense that they’re super street style, definitely Yeezy inspired, and I liked the unique look to it, which is why I was drawn to it in the first place.”
Geistwear’s current line consists of a black 2020 sweatshirt emblazoned with the word “Trojan” in a spiky font and a flaming Trojan skull graphic. But equally important to the “Yeezus” inspired aesthetic is the message printed on the sweatshirt: “The future awaits” on the front and “Moving forward” on the back.
“What I really tied the story into is that the past few years, when I entered USC as a freshman in 2017, it’s always been tied to some sort of negative story by the Los Angeles Times, some sort of scandal,” said Ronquillo-Morgan, who is majoring in computer science and business administration. “I really wanted to come up with something as a testament, as a student, that was really personal to me and has helped me really propel forward.”
Ronquillo-Morgan handles the website, analytics and advertising side of Geistwear while Diogo, with her strong design and artistic background, creates most of the designs and helps with photography and filming for shoots. 
Diogo said the designs for Geistwear are inspired by current trends, especially those popularized by rappers like West and Travis Scott. To avoid getting caught in a niche, they base their design aesthetic around the way Supreme streetwear comes out with a launch one week then switches its style with the next release. 
Diogo’s friend Vaughn Hilsheimer, a junior majoring in architecture, designed the “Bet on USC” T-shirt from last season, which displayed a football playing card on the back. Experienced with creating graffiti art for fraternity parties, he was able to collect input on what many frat members would like to see in college apparel. 
This season, they switched to made-to-order production instead of mass production, which allows them to have more control over how much clothing they order and increase the rounds of apparel releases they drop. When inspiration hits, Diogo and Ronquillo-Morgan can design and release a new line, avoiding waste and producing a quicker turnaround. 
“Sometimes, ordering the clothes as early as we used to, it didn’t give us the freedom to be as creative as we possibly could be,” Diogo said. “This year it’s about pushing the envelope and trying new things for us … When we drop round one and we decide in a month that that’s it for round one, then it’s over. I can start creating a new design.”
New designs are already on their minds, Diogo said. The duo is considering a drop inspired by Coachella, taking notes from the music festival’s iconic look.
“A lot of complaints that we got was that this look was too grunge for us,” Diogo said. “I don’t ever want to get to this place where something is ‘too much’ for us to do.”
From personally reaching out to the customer base through Instagram to collaborating with brand ambassadors and other artists, working closely with students is central to Geistwear, Ronquillo-Morgan said. It’s all part of the college spirit. 
“It’s really rewarding because it’s an actual human being behind the scenes that you’re working with,” Ronquillo-Morgan said. “It’s not just a customer — it’s another student who’s close to your age.”
As for the long-term goals of the brand, Ronquillo-Morgan said she and Diogo hope to scale the company so it can continue to grow through e-commerce after they both graduate and may include USC-unaffiliated fashion.
According to Diogo, the duo also hopes to expand Geistwear and bring the “L.A. vibe” to other schools where there is a strong football culture but lack of clothes that are “cool.” Diogo, who is from Wisconsin, said that her friends at the University of Wisconsin — Madison only have spirit wear at their bookstore, offering another potential market for Geistwear.
