In 2015, Paula Hawkins thrilled the world with the novel The Girl on the Train. A year later, the popular novel was adapted to film.
The Girl on the Train tells the story of an alcoholic divorcee who attaches herself to a web of mystery after the disappearance of a young housewife. The film stars Emily Blunt in the title role, supported by Justin Theroux, Rebecca Ferguson, Luke Evans and newcomer Haley Bennett.
Photo from Paramount Pictures We are going on the right track · Emily Blunt plays lead Rachel Watson, a woman who fantasizes about the perfect couple that her train passes everyday after a divorce. The Girl on the Train is a film based on the best-selling novel by Paula Hawkins. The film has often been compared to Gone Girl due to its similar plot style.
The film opens in a similar fashion to the novel, with Rachel (Emily Blunt) riding the train into the city, glancing out the window at the lives of those around her. With a voiceover narration, Rachel describes her descent into alcoholism after her divorce from husband Tom (Justin Theroux) and his marriage with another woman named Anna (Rebecca Ferguson).
The two live next door to a couple, Megan and Scott, played by Haley Bennett and Luke Evans respectively. Instead of London, the film is set in New York City. Though the setting is different from that of the novel, the film immediately captures its original tone. While the opening scene feels a bit slow and eerie, the story picks up quickly with the introduction of Megan and Scott, the seemingly perfect couple Rachel develops an obsession with. As the film reaches its second act, Megan goes missing and the mystery of her disappearance begins.
The film remains mostly faithful to the novel, but it focuses too much of its plot on Rachel’s point of view. Scott is only in a featured in a few scenes, most of which depict him having sex with Megan. His arc is lost in translation, and his character in the film is easily forgettable.
The minor characters were a bit underdeveloped in comparison to Rachel. Haley Bennett, however, proved her worth with a riveting performance of an incredibly troubled young woman. Each scene in which she is featured revealed a new aspect of her personality, and Bennett effortlessly captured Megan’s reluctance to open up about her troubled life, as well as the demons that haunt her.
Emily Blunt’s performance as Rachel was equally as commendable as that of Bennett. She was captivating, dexterously conveying Rachel’s uncomfortability and growing paranoia throughout the film. Her performance, along with Bennett’s, drove the film.
Justin Theroux, like Blunt and Bennett, made a surprisingly impressive performance in a role unlike any other he had before.
Though Rachel is the main character of the story, The Girl on the Train is a bigger portrait of many deeply flawed characters. The novel indeed does a better job at developing the points of view of each character, but the film stands on its own as a suspenseful mystery.
Every character has his or her morality questioned at some point in the film, and they are all suspects in Megan’s case.
The film’s narrative features several flashbacks. Director Tate Taylor’s direction amplified the suspense, and he did well observing the internal emotions of the characters that were so well-described in the novel. Taylor consistently blurred the line between reality and fiction, visually embodying Rachel’s intoxication through blurred, slowed down shots.
As the film’s mystery reached its end, Rachel was on the brink of a complete breakdown. Taylor skillfully showed this in his direction.
Taylor’s use of shots does well to capture the distress of each character as they attempt to piece together the puzzle. The film’s pace is undoubtedly slow, and viewers of the film unfamiliar with the novel may be hesitant to delve completely into the story.
With that being said, Taylor’s direction and the performers did well to make the film stand with the novel as a compelling, slow-burning thriller. The Girl on the Train found success in its ability to separate itself from today’s thrillers. Because it relied mostly on the studying of its characters rather than action and a fast pace, it stood out in the crowded genre.
The climax of the film was abrupt and may seem anticlimactic, but it kept with the subtle, bleak tone throughout the film. While The Girl on the Train did not translate from novel to film with perfect ease, Tate Taylor’s keen direction accompanied by wonderful performances by Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Justin Theroux made the film worth the watch.

Eduardo Mollinedo-Piñón’s relationship with his professors at USC began before he ever set foot on campus. When hundreds of USC faculty and staff members donated part of their salaries to support programs that helped him pursue his passion for music.
Photo courtesy of Good Neighbors Hardware for success · The USC Good Neighbors Campaign provides support for the Foshay Learning Center, through which local students participated in an international robotics competition in June 2015.
Mollinedo-Piñón, who graduated from USC with a B.A. in comparative literature in 2015, said that in middle school, he had few opportunities to explore the things he was passionate about. However, that changed after he transferred to the Foshay Learning Center just a few blocks away from USC. There, he became involved with programs such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a college preparation program, as well as the USC Thornton School of Music Outreach Program.
“I received a lot of significant support that is catered more to students like me who grew up in very low-income families,” Mollinedo-Piñón said.
These initiatives, which funded his first musical instrument and set Mollinedo-Piñón on the path to a full music scholarship at USC, were supported by the USC Good Neighbors Campaign, which allows USC faculty and staff to collaborate with local nonprofit organizations on projects in the neighborhoods surrounding the University Park and Health Sciences campuses. Since 1994, the Good Neighbors Campaign has awarded more than $20 million to benefit community programs and given over 600 grants to support community organizations.
On Sept. 29, President C.L. Max Nikias welcomed hundreds of faculty and staff members who donated at least 1 percent of their salaries to the Good Neighbors Campaign to his home. Many of the programs funded by the campaign are geared toward education and are focused on enhancing the experience for students from elementary to high school through subjects ranging from the sciences to the arts and humanities.
Good Neighbors Campaign Director Carolina Castillo said that the programs funded by the organization gives students experiences that local schools often can’t afford due to a lack of resources. For example, Castillo brought up the fourth and fifth grade science programs that the campaign is helping fund as an example of how USC students can help younger kids explore their interest in science.
“We hear stories of kids that seem to have too much energy in the classroom — they are smart but disruptive,” Castillo said. “But as soon as they funnel their interest in a way that is productive, they actually can be very successful and use that energy in productive ways. The science program is one of those examples where students engage in something that is of interest to them and they are able to then really nourish that curiosity that children have.”
Castillo highlighted the importance of the opportunities and the support system the funded programs can give members of the community who may be struggling, whether through education or other services.
“Everyone has had some defining moment in their lives that helped to put them on the path to where they are now,” Castillo said. “We need to say how can we do that for others and how can we make sure others have that same opportunity.”
Since graduating from high school, Mollinedo-Piñón has performed at the Hollywood Bowl and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, presented his research at an NYU International Conference while still a junior in college and now works for the Long Beach Opera. He credits the programs funded by the Good Neighbors Campaign for helping him get to where he is today.
“The reason that I was successful in not just going to college but completing college was in part because of these programs,” Mollinedo-Piñón said. “No institution has had a greater positive impact on me than USC, and it was based on the generosity of students, faculty and staff. It is really important for all USC students to see how important these programs are.”
Students, faculty and staff can participate in the upcoming Friends and Neighbors Day on Oct. 15, which aims to give back to the local community through a Saturday of service.

A USC alumnus is spearheading a project to make a Los Angeles elementary school more environmentally sustainable.
Photo courtesy of Virtual Space, L.L.C. Going green · USC alumnus Carlos Rodriguez, class of 2013, hopes to construct an Eco Learning Center that combines technology with sustainability at Malabar Elementary School in Boyle Heights.
Malabar Elementary School lies in the heart of Boyle Heights, a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood east of Downtown, and has been “[fostering] the highest quality teaching and learning for all” for over 100 years, according to the school’s website.
Carlos Rodriguez, who graduated from USC in 2013 with a graduate certificate in geographic information science and technology, aims to construct an Eco Learning Center at the school to teach students about the environment through technology. The project will allow the school staff at Malabar to work in tandem with parents and the community at large to create a space that will benefit everyone.
“The concept is a ‘garden on steroids,’ with two pathways with learning stations along the way where teachers can sit with students and discuss the environment and science,” Rodriguez said.
The garden will utilize technology like apps and Google glasses to enhance how children learn about the environment. Most of the project is being provided pro bono by Virtual Space, the consulting firm Rodriguez founded in Los Angeles in 1987.
Rodriguez, currently the president of Virtual Space, said that the company helps clients understand how to use technology to improve communication.
“My philosophy is a ‘don’t tell me what you can’t do, tell me what you’re going to do’ mentality,” Rodriguez said. “That is a philosophy intrinsic to Virtual Space today.”
This way of thinking is one reason Rodriguez set out to help the Boyle Heights community. His project aims to not only enhance the learning among students, but to act as an open space for the community to utilize.
The initiative is projected to tentatively launch next fall. The first steps in its construction include removing several pre-existing bungalows, which would reduce the building’s carbon footprint and pave the way to install grass. This would create the allocated space reserved for the project, and in turn become a sustainable learning center.
Virtual Space and Malabar Elementary are launching a GoFundMe account this coming week, in hopes of raising enough money to move forward with the project this January.
Dieuwertje Kast, a staff member at USC’s Joint Educational Project, is also looking to collaborate with Virtual Space and Malabar Elementary in the near future.
Kast currently manages two main programs through JEP, the USC Young Scientists Program and the Wonderkids Program.
“JEP and USC at large foster a culture of social good and awareness,” Kast said. “JEP in particular provides a variety of resources to the local community that would not otherwise happen.”
Rodriguez also credited USC for instilling the ideals of philanthropy and community outreach in his personal brand, which he said inspired him to start the project at Malabar Elementary.
“I feel fortunate as a graduate of USC,” Rodriguez said. “It gave me insight, as a resource center, on how to care and give back to the community.”

Two suspects have been arrested and taken into custody in connection with a robbery that took place in the early hours of Friday morning on the 1200 block of West Adams Boulevard, according to a statement released Saturday by the Department of Public Safety.
The Los Angeles Police Department and DPS identified the suspects by reviewing private and DPS security footage. At approximately 11:45 p.m. on Saturday, the first suspect and weapon were taken into custody at a traffic stop in the area. A subsequent investigation after the first arrest resulted in the arrest of the second suspect.
The victim, a female USC student, positively identified both suspects, who were in their early 20s and wearing all black at the time of the crime. The first suspect was described as a 5’10”, thin black male with braces. The second suspect was a 5’4”, black female of average weight with her hair in a bun.
The victim said that she arrived home alone just after 2 a.m. when a man and a woman approached her as she was walking up to the front gate of her house. According to the victim, a USC Uber had dropped her off just a few houses down on Magnolia Avenue and Adams Boulevard.
The pair, who were crouching behind a car near the house as the student arrived, allegedly drew a gun and demanded any cash on her person. Police said the investigation revealed that the weapon used to threaten the student was actually an airsoft gun.
“It looked like they were just waiting for someone to come down the street,” said the victim, who asked to remain anonymous because the robbery was at her personal residence.
She said that when she told them she didn’t have any cash, the two suspects made her walk with them to three different ATM machines at gas stations along Vermont Avenue. They went up to Washington Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, just under a mile from the initial robbery point. The couple eventually escaped with $400 in cash from the student’s account.
DPS said the robbery is not believed to be related to a string of robberies that occurred last weekend on both the 3000th block of Figueroa Street and 28th Street. In those incidents, a group of four men physically assaulted and robbed two students, attempted to rob a third and physically assaulted a fourth.

At the Homecoming football game this year, game day visitors can expect to see several large milk jugs, passed around the Coliseum by volunteers to collect donations to send local elementary school students to camp.
Photo courtesy of Andrew Sonnabend We can do it · Volunteers at the 2015 Pass the Can event, Troy Camp’s annual fundraiser, raised enough money to finance the summer camp, which draws 200 elementary school children each summer.
The fundraiser is an annual tradition of Troy Camp, one of USC’s oldest and largest student-run philanthropic organizations, which provides long-term mentorship for students in South Los Angeles.
All donations made during the fundraiser, known as Pass the Can, are used to help Troy Camp raise the funds necessary to host its annual summer camp for more than 200 elementary school students from 20 different schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
While the Pass the Can fundraiser goes on, Troy Camp also hosts a kids’ event at the game for the 200 students that went to camp the previous summer.
Andrew Sonnabend, executive director of fundraising for Troy Camp, said that events like this fundraiser help foster long-term mentorship in the students that attended camp, and it helps them to reconnect with their friends and counselors from last year’s camp.
“Pass the Can has been a crucial part of the USC community for many years,” Sonnabend said. “For a whole football game, we are able to raise funds to allow local students to be kids. Past Pass the Can directors always say their best time at the event is standing on the field looking around seeing the smiles on the faces of the kids who are going to their first football game and seeing a whole crowd of USC students, alumni and fans who are taking their time to support these students.”
Sonnabend also emphasized the importance of hosting events to fundraise for local students to have the opportunity to be part of the Trojan Family.
“The mission of this event is to not only raise funds for campers to attend camp, but we also take many campers to their first football game and we act as a bridge between the USC community and the local community,” Sonnabend said.
Kelly Pascual, a member of Troy Camp, attended the organization’s summer camp as an elementary schooler and said that she appreciates the chance to be part of the organization as a college student.
“Pass the Can is a great fundraiser that raises money to send kids to camp and has kids at the event that are able to watch the game as well,” Pascual said. “Having been in Troy Camp in elementary school, I know the impact it had on the kids that go through the program because of the dedication of the counselors.”
Pass the Can will take place during the USC vs. Oregon Homecoming game on Nov. 5. Volunteers will receive a free t-shirt, Yogurtland coupon and a game ticket. Volunteers can sign up for the event on Troy Camp’s website.

The prosecution rested its case Friday in the trial of Alejandra Guerrero, who has been charged with the murder of USC graduate student, Xinran Ji.
Jurors heard several rounds of testimony, starting with a forensic expert who confirmed that red stains found on a baseball bat believed to be the murder weapon were a perfect match for the victim’s blood. Mei Ling Cabral Robinson, who works for the Los Angeles Police Department’s Forensic Science Division, also testified that bloodstains found on a pair of jeans recovered by police the night of the murder matched Ji’s DNA profile.
DNA from the handle of the bat, however, turned up inconclusive results due to a lack of testable evidence.
Prosecutors also presented screenshots of Guerrero’s Facebook messages leading up to the night of the murder, which were retrieved with a search warrant. The messages specifically referenced “flocking,” a term that Guerrero used to describe robbing, and established a motive for Ji’s murder. LAPD detectives said that the group Guerrero was with that night was driving around looking for someone to “flock,” the Los Angeles Times reported.
The Facebook testimony had been redacted due to several objections from the defense, which claimed that the full transcript of the messages contained a “racial overtone that would inflame the jury’s passions” and unfairly bias jurors against Guerrero. Language such as the word “n—-r” was removed, as well as references to previous altercations that Guerrero had had.
Ji, an engineering student from China, was killed in July 2014 while walking to his off-campus apartment. Three others are also charged with the homicide, but Jonathan Del Carmen, Alberto Ochoa and Andrew Garcia will be tried separately from Guerrero.
The trial will resume Tuesday morning, when the defense will present its case to the jury.

Last week, before the vice presidential debate, the first general-election debate moderated by an Asian-American journalist, Fox News aired a segment on The O’Reilly Factor filled with every Asian stereotype you could think of.
I remember secretly watching it during one my classes, after scrolling through Facebook and seeing posts of outrage and disgust from my peers as well as dozens of shares on articles by Asian media outlets demanding an apology.
While reporter Jesse Watters intended for his segment to be hilarious and satirical, mentioning that it was supposed to be “tongue-in-cheek” on his personal Twitter, it was offensive and unabashedly racist.
Fox anchor Bill O’Reilly sent Watters to do this segment in New York City’s Chinatown to sample the political opinion of Asian Americans on the election. But instead of a segment actually sampling political opinion, it became a mockery of an entire race.

He poked fun of Chinese people who clearly did not speak English, asking them in a Tae Kwon Do studio, which is Korean, if they knew karate, which is Japanese. The segment also zoomed in on  elderly Chinese people who didn’t respond because they didn’t know English.
He went on to ask if Chinese food in China was just called food, if he had to bow to say hello and how they felt about everything being “made in China.” I thought of somebody interrogating my grandmother in English and then zooming in on her face on national television for humor and felt immediately hurt and disgusted.
Disguised as light-hearted humor, the segment was dehumanizing and openly racist. How is harassing elderly first-generation immigrants and perpetuating stereotypes funny? Especially when it’s so rare that a major news station actually samples the opinions of Asian Americans.
I shared the video on Facebook and a friend of mine, who saw my post, messaged me and asked me if it would have been different if an Asian hosted the segment and if it is different than other Asian people who sometimes poke fun at themselves too.
The difference is that when Asian comedians poke fun at their own stereotypes, they use it as as satire effectively to raise awareness, so everyone can know how disgusting it is that they are being treated that way — not the way that Jesse Watters did in The O’Reilly Factor.
While the reaction from most media outlets (even right-wing websites) was of anger and disgust, everyone knows Fox News is just going to get a slap on the wrist. Just like how Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump always says outrageous things and gets by — even getting applauded for transparency, — Bill O’Reilly continues to stand by Jesse Watters and Fox News is still going to air shamelessly horrible segments.
The best thing that came out of this however, if we’re trying to be positive, is the humorous segment that The Daily Show ran after the incident.
“If you wanna come at Chinese people, make fun of China’s high pollution, or the fact they censor most of the internet, which in this case might actually be a good thing since no person in China will ever have to watch your garbage attempt at comedy,” Daily Show correspondent Ronny Chieng said.

Nick Munoz, founder and president of Dating Trojans, has lamented the hook-up culture present in USC’s party scene since his freshman year. He was never drawn to the excitement of the night life that attracted many students. Instead, he sought substantial relationships but found a lack of options in the USC community for students to meet and interact with prospective partners. The idea came to Munoz when he was in New York, in an environment completely different from USC.
Photo courtesy of Dating Trojans Love at first sight · Dating Trojans is USC’s first club dedicated to forging new relationships with others through activities like speed dating. The club hosted its first speed dating event (above) on Friday.
“I saw that many colleges in New York had speed dating. So I thought, why not bring  the idea back to USC?” Munoz said.
It took him a year to follow through with this idea, and through his entrepreneurship class, Munoz was able to turn speed dating into a feasible project by forming a club called Dating Trojans.
On Friday, Munoz and the executive board of Dating Trojans hosted their first ever Speed Dating session that was open to all USC students. The lights were dimmed and the candles were lit in King Hall, as the club aimed to create a romantic ambience for the 60 students present at the session.
Upon arrival, each student was presented with a name tag, a pamphlet and a pen for keeping track of names throughout the event. Seating was arranged carefully, according to the gender preference students provided in their speed dating RSVP.
For some students, the event served as a unique way to meet new people, and many came with a group of friends to try out speed dating.
“We’re so used to different forms of meeting and talking to people besides, well, face-to-face interaction,” said Laura Gouillon, a junior majoring in computer science.
Dating Trojans aims to counter the impersonal matchmaking system in popular dating apps like Tinder and instead provide an authentic space for individuals to meet.
The event largely attracted students’ attention because many had never had the opportunity to speed date before.
“It’s something I wanted to check off my bucket list,” said Connor Cogdill, a freshman majoring in economics mathematics.
Students came with an open-minded attitude, regardless if they were looking for love, friendships or a unique experience.
For each speed dating rotation, the women  stayed in place while the men moved a seat over. Each pairing was given three minutes to exchange names and interact, and at the end of the event, students were able to fill out a survey e-mail for their potential matches.
The event started at 7:30 p.m. and ended after 9 p.m., giving Trojans a chance to connect with a wide variety of individuals, even if conversations lasted only for about three minutes.
Dating Trojans’ goal, however, is not to simply match-make students. The club aims to host events in a safe environment that promotes inclusivity and aspires to bring together Trojans from all different backgrounds.
“We’re planning on doing an event for graduate students specifically and one for LGBT students as well,” he said.
So far, Dating Trojans plans to host a monthly speed-dating session, but they’re open to the possibility of having holiday or themed mingling events in the future.
“Dating Trojans aims to bring together students who seek an alternative from the hook-up culture and we hope our club will create a safe place for people to meet,” the executive board said.
The new club is still a work in progress for Munoz and the executive board, but they have high hopes for future events.

Christian Zucconi is Grouplove’s main vocalist and guitarist, as well as a New York City native. Though he is attached to his hometown music scene, Zucconi had to acknowledge the high energy of both the group and the crowd on Friday night at the Hollywood Palladium.
“Tonight, L.A. has it over New York,” Zucconi said.
The show opened with the L.A.-based band MUNA, a trio that warmed up the crowd with features from their debut release, The Loudspeaker EP. Their performance fused synthpop with the familiar, pop-rock flair of the headliner. The funky soft-rock set teased the crowd with catchy, feel-good vibes — a taste of what Grouplove fans were looking forward to. MUNA left fans excited for what would come next.
As soon as the synth riff of Grouplove’s “I’m With You” began to fade in, the crowd stirred eagerly with it. A teal backlight gradually filled the stage, and the members entered and positioned themselves at their instruments. As the drums picked up and the lights revealed his face, Zucconi flashed fellow lead vocalist Hannah Hooper a small smile and began to sing. The crowd immediately cheered louder, clapping and singing along.
The show’s overarching atmosphere was happy and loving. For a full floor and balcony venue, the concert felt uniquely intimate. After “I’m With You,” the group performed an upbeat rendition of “Good Morning” from their newest album Big Mess, followed later by the high-charting single “Tongue Tied.”
The audience jumped, danced and echoed the lyrics proudly. The stage glowed along to the beat of the song, with lights swaying with the audience in color pairs.
Pulsating through orange, blue, red and green, the giant collage-style hands hanging in the background lit up to the rhythm of the tracks. Smiles were abounding, and there was a sense of carefree togetherness. Everybody in the Palladium felt community in the melodies.
The set list struck a balance between new and old hits; features from Big Mess were paired in succession with classics like “Shark Attack” and “Borderlines and Aliens.” Both donning edgy, white-lace pieces, Zucconi and Hooper radiated an irresistible energy. They sang and danced for the audience and for each other. The feel-good rhythm of the songs was reflected in their movements and that of their fans. The crowd jumped, nodded and grooved along with them.
Just before their last few songs, the lights suddenly began to pulse to a guitar lick, first in alternating colors and then gaining speed into full white. Surprising the audience with “Sabotage,” a cover of the Beastie Boys classic, the group vigorously belted the verses of the rap-rock song. The response was visceral and sharp as some fans began to dance and bounce quickly to the rhythm of the guitar. Ryan Rabin on drums banged out the rest of the song for the impassioned crowd.
After performing the track, the band regrouped for one of the more subdued songs on their new album, “Enlighten Me.” With an emphatic keyboard and slow guitar, Zucconi sings broodingly, “Won’t you enlighten me? / Won’t you just set me free?”
The audience gradually put their hands in the air, swaying in unison to the tempo of the ballad. Friends hugged and couples kissed — the song ended and left the crowd cheering with a renewed sense of intimacy.
Following a heartfelt rendition of the crowd-favorite “Ways To Go,” fans were left uplifted and optimistic though they knew the show was almost over. As the group prepared for their last song of the night, Zucconi sat down with his guitar and thanked the crowd.
“Everything can be so overwhelming, so thank you,” he said.
He spoke to the unifying power of music, of life and of the fans. The band and the fans mutually understood the “big mess” life could be. Yet by the end of the show, in that moment, they had their songs and they had each other. The crowd experienced a loving, implicit embrace through music that night. Zucconi captivated the entire venue, and the fans hung onto every word he said Without a doubt, the Palladium felt the love of the group.
“This is a crazy f-cking world,” Zucconi said from behind his guitar.

Near the beginning of the third quarter of the men’s water polo game Friday against No. 8 Pepperdine, junior driver Grant Stein was handed a golden opportunity in the form of a 5-meter penalty. Before the shot, junior goaltender McQuin Baron yelled for a teammate to grab the rebound, and then appeared to flash a smile. There was never any doubt. Stein nailed the shot to extend USC’s lead to 9-2.
Katie Chin | Daily Trojan Freshman power · Freshman driver Thomas Dunstan notched two goals against Pepperdine as USC defeated the No. 8 Waves on Friday.
The play was indicative of a dominating performance for the No. 3-ranked Men of Troy. Ten different players scored in the 15-4 victory over the Waves, and five players hit the two goal mark.
The Trojans closed out the weekend by beating UC Irvine 20-4 on Sunday. Junior driver Matteo Morelli scored four goals and both Edwards brothers — Lachlan and Blake — recorded hat tricks in the win. USC led 2-1 after the first quarter but outscored UC Irvine 10-1 in the second quarter and cruised to victory.
Against Pepperdine, the offense looked in sync for most of the game, producing a steady output of scoring after the first quarter in which the Trojans only led 2-1.
“The team chemistry is good,” said junior Blake Edwards, who had two goals. “It’s something that we’re working on. It’s getting better. We have a lot of new players this season, a couple young freshmen, but they’re playing fantastic.”
Four freshmen scored goals against Pepperdine, including two apiece from Thomas Dunstan and Marin Dasic.
The second and third quarters were particularly prolific for the Trojans offense. Dunstan scored his second goal of the game just before halftime, concluding a five-goal onslaught and solidifying a commanding 7-1 lead. By the third quarter, the Waves were conceding frequent point blank goals as their defense diminished over time. USC added five more goals in the third and three in the fourth. Edwards scored his second goal in the fourth quarter; he leads the team with 24 on the season. Pepperdine managed to score its fourth and final goal just as time was expiring.
Defensively, USC continued its string of excellence. Baron made history in the first quarter with his 676th career save, which propelled him to second all time in the school record books. For the game, he recorded an impressive 14 saves, anchoring a defense that allows an MPSF-leading 3.85 goals per game. Pepperdine had its fair share of scoring opportunities, even hitting the post on a few occasions, but Baron was too much of a force in goal. Baron did not hesitate when asked about the team’s biggest strength.
“Defense obviously,” he said. “We’re number one in the country right now.”
Baron was dismissive of his accomplishment, though, instead citing the desire to continue winning rather than worry about personal achievements.
With this key victory over a strong team in Pepperdine, the Trojans improve to 14-1 with their only loss being to No. 2 Cal two weeks ago in the Mountain Pacific Invitational. USC started the season ranked at the number two spot but fell to number three after the Cal loss.
“We’re not too concerned about it,” Edwards said on the slight fall in the rankings. “We just know we have to put in the effort and the work and then the results will show.”
Despite the stellar performance on Friday, head coach Jovan Vavic found plenty to critique. Ever the perfectionist, Vavic vocally reprimanded his team in the second quarter after a goal by senior driver Nick Bell, assisted by junior utility Bryce Hoerman.
“It’s a snap, not a flick!,” Vavic said.
Next up, the Trojans will take on UC Santa Barbara at home next Sunday.

Saturday’s victory against the Colorado Buffaloes was a major one for the USC football team. It was neither pretty nor perfect, but the hard-fought win represented growth. Nothing symbolized this more than the aggressive play call on 3rd and 7 with 1:19 remaining in the game.
Brian Chin | Daily Trojan Inopportune injury · Senior running back Justin Davis was carted off the field during Saturday’s win over Colorado with a high ankle sprain. Davis is USC’s leading rusher this season with 476 yards through six games.
Instead of running a conservative draw play or a safe pass well short of the sticks, USC put trust in its redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold and junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. The trust was rewarded when Darnold found Smith-Schuster in single coverage for a 25-yard gain that effectively ended the game.
This play call represented a stark contrast from the decision-making by the coaching staff at the end of the Utah game. At Rice Eccles stadium, USC ran a safe short pass to Smith-Schuster on third down late in the game that had no chance to move the sticks. That play was the one that preceded the infamous punt call from the Utah 37-yard line.
Though the circumstances were somewhat different, there were a lot of parallels between the two situations. It appears as if the coaching staff has learned from their mistake two weeks ago, and that is the most you can ask for from a young, new group at the helm. They realized that when you have playmakers like Darnold and Smith-Schuster, it is smart to get them the ball when the game is on the line.
Coach Clay Helton isn’t going to turn into Nick Saban overnight, but Saturday demonstrated his ability to learn and grow on the job. Considering Colorado’s offense had scored a touchdown and a field goal on the previous two possessions against a worn-out defense, Helton deserves enormous credit for deciding to let his offense be the aggressor and preserve the victory.
It wasn’t totally the coaching on Saturday. Overall, the Trojans made the plays to win the game. Whether it was junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson shape-shifting for an interception that might have defied the laws of physics or senior wide receiver Darreus Rogers imposing his will on a Colorado defensive back, USC players stepped up. When mistakes are made — which they were to the tune of four turnovers – a team needs its stars to carry them. That is exactly what happened.
The Trojans still have a long way to go to become a complete team this season. There is something holding them back almost every game, whether that is penalties or turnovers or botched assignments. Saturday, the poison of choice was the fumble. It’s very hard to win games when you lose the turnover battle 4-1.
Not only did the Trojans suffer from a rash of miscues, but they also lost senior tailback Justin Davis in the third quarter. Davis, who was on his way to another 100-yard game, left with a high ankle sprain. The Trojan offense just was not the same without the vision and agility of the senior leader.
It was clear the scheme was reeling after Davis went down. For a few straight drives after the injury, the runs that were routinely for six to eight yards with Davis went for two to three with the other backs. This left Darnold in the unenviable position of making plays in third down situations with the Colorado defense bearing down on him. Needless to say, this line of play calling led to three straight scoreless drives in the third and fourth quarter.
Thankfully, the offensive coaching staff finally made some adjustments during the final few drives and put the ball in the hands of Darnold to win the game. The hesitation to let Darnold carry the team was understandable, as the redshirt freshman had a string of turnovers early in the third. After that, Darnold appeared shaky at times. This could also be attributed to the fact that the bulk of his passing situations were on third down facing the blitz. No quarterback is at his best running for his life as soon as the ball is snapped.
Nevertheless, Darnold regained his composure, as all great quarterbacks do, and marched the Trojans down the field for the go ahead touchdown. He was of course aided greatly by Rogers and his superhuman catch. That play seemed to settle the quarterback down, and from there he was back to normal.
To continue to succeed the Trojans need to figure out a way to compensate for Davis’s absence. High ankle sprains are limiting at best, and the team might have to prepare without the running back for the time being. On the bright side, sophomore running back Ronald Jones looked to finally get in a groove on the last drive. Maybe a greater bulk of the workload will help him regain his freshman year form.
The Trojans still have Darnold. Mistakes happen from a redshirt freshman, and he more than makes up for it with his tremendous playmaking. He gets both the receivers and tight ends involved in the game, and if he can hold onto the ball a little bit better, the offense will regain its explosive scoring form next week against the Wildcats.
Each game, the Trojans should be improving. While they regressed in some areas, coaching made a giant leap forward and the defense is starting to coalesce. Combine that with a hard-fought, narrow victory, and the season still has some promise left.

Riding the momentum of a statement victory over top-ranked Stanford, USC women’s soccer welcomed No. 14 Cal to McAlister Field on Sunday looking to claim its fifth win against top-25 opposition this season. The Women of Troy turned heads with its 3-0 shutout of the Cardinal on Thursday, but the Golden Bears took the spoils in a back-and-forth game, scoring a late goal to clinch a 1-0 upset over USC.
Julia Erickson | Daily Trojan All good things come to an end · Senior Mandy Freeman turns upfield in Saturday’s 1-0 loss to Cal, USC’s first defeat since August.
The Women of Troy knew there would be targets on their backs after they took down the Cardinal, and sure enough, Cal arrived determined to stymie their momentum and leapfrog them in the Pac-12 standings. The Bears were the busier team early on, forcing four saves out of redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, who has recorded an outstanding eight cleans sheets in 13 games so far this fall.
As they did against Stanford, however, the Women of Troy settled in as the half progressed and began to string more passes together in the attacking third. The first half ended scoreless, but USC threatened in the second period — and it looked as if the Women of Troy might break the deadlock late. Multiple Trojan shots went just wide, and senior Morgan Andrews had an effort cleared off the line with 10 minutes to play.
But the Golden Bears looked to fashion an opportunity on the break, and in the 85th minute, Abigail Kim found herself in a one-on-one opportunity against Prudhomme after a Cal counterattack. The midfielder calmly slotted into the far post to break Trojan hearts and deny Prudhomme another clean sheet, despite the keeper’s 11 saves.
Now the Women of Troy prepare for a road trip to Tempe,  Arizona trying to shake off the frustration of Sunday’s loss. Head coach Keidane McAlpine hoped his team would learn from its experience to make adjustments going into next Saturday’s game at Arizona State.
“We had a lapse, and it cost us. It’s a great lesson at this point in the year,” he said. “But there are a lot of games to play. We’ve still got an opportunity to finish toward the top, and that’s going to be the goal: get better in the next game and keep moving forward.”
McAlpine also pointed to USC’s two losses to open the season, which the Women of Troy responded to by winning a program-record 10 consecutive matches.
“Losses sometimes teach you a lot more about yourself [than wins],” he said. “We’ve been fortunate to win some games when we made some mistakes and didn’t play well. Today caught up to us, and now we’ve got to grow again from this one.”
The Women of Troy may no longer be on a record-setting run, but McAlpine urged his players to maintain the same mentality that made them so successful before Sunday’s loss. After all, it’s a long season, and USC remains very much in hunt for the Pac-12 title and an NCAA tournament berth.
“I think the approach to our next games has to be the same,” McAlpine said. “Just try to do the fundamental things that got us where we are and keep going.”
USC will go for a bounce-back win on Saturday. Arizona State is also coming off a split week after playing two games that went into overtime in Washington, as the Sun Devils beat Washington 3-2 on Thursday before falling to Washington State 1-2 on Sunday.

Where is the proverbial breaking point for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump supporters? A 2005 video showing Donald Trump speaking to television personality Billy Bush about non-consensual kissing and grabbing women’s genitals has dominated the news cycle since the video’s release Friday. The “locker-room banter” between the two men should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the Trump campaign, known for its leader’s habit of committing one gaffe after another without apology — or in this most recent case, an insincere one. This particular incident is, however, different than the others to which we have grown accustomed. These marked differences led me to my own breaking point Friday night.
I made a promise to myself early on during this election that I wouldn’t provoke political debate with Facebook friends. I would, I told myself, let the handful of Trump supporters on my newsfeed pass by without comment. If the temptation to engage them grew too strong, I would simply unfollow them. This strategy proved successful until Friday night. Just before midnight, I was scrolling through my newsfeed, interested to see my friends’ reactions to the news, when I came across a post from a former classmate and Trump supporter. The post was a video of Donald Trump giving his rehearsed statement in response to the controversy, with a transcript provided in the caption. Once I started reading the transcript, I knew my personal promise was lost.
My resolve quickly faded, as I realized that this latest revelation was not a gaffe like the others. What Donald Trump described in that 2005 video was sexual assault -— the severity of which he now attempted to obfuscate with a rare “apology.” As the clock soon turned past midnight, I found myself drafting something that resembled an essay of nearly 500 words, not a comment. While the outrage  justifiably focused on the indecency of Trump’s comments, I became doubly enraged by the content of this so-called “apology.” What struck me most, and became the introduction of my Facebook comment, was Trump’s reference to the 2005 recording as “more than a decade-old.” Was Trump really trying to suggest that he made these comments when he was younger and immature, and therefore deserves our grace? Trump was 59 years old, not 15 years old, when he spoke of his fondness of sexually assaulting women he finds attractive.
This appeal to time and maturity was the core of Billy Bush’s own apology. “Obviously I’m embarrassed and ashamed. It’s no excuse, but this happened 11 years ago — I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry,” Bush said in a statement. Mind you, in 2005, Bush was 33 years old and married with three daughters.
Both apologies fall hopelessly flat in that they excuse criminality as immaturity and perpetuate a rape culture in which we are told “boys will be boys.” Simply, Trump and Bush’s statements attempt to normalize attacks on women. However, we’re told that Trump and men like him are not the broken ones. Rather, “Washington is totally broken,” according to Trump’s statement, and Trump is the only person capable of saving our government from ruin. Though this might come as a surprise to Trump and his supporters, Washington has always been broken. Washington, like the rest of the world, is a place filled with corruption and greed and pain. Trump is not a savior. He cannot save Washington or the United States or the world, anymore than he could save his multiple businesses that are now bankrupt. As I am assured that Trump will not imbue any shade of greatness upon this country, I concurrently fear his capacity to make not only the United States but also the world a measurably worse places to live — especially for women.
Like Washington, Trump is driven by greed — an insatiable desire for power and status and wealth — and will conveniently apologize to save himself, while, in the next breath, continuing to spew a false gospel. Friday night, this false gospel finally shattered my self-control, leading to the longest Facebook comment I have ever written, which was deleted by my former classmate within a matter of minutes. Though my words no longer live on Facebook, they live here, without interference. While Trump attempts to conceal his abuse of women, I refuse to be silenced.

Hillary’s transgressions against Bill Clinton’s numerous female victims far exceed anything that Trump has said or done.  Nice try, though.
Agreed.  Hillary has broken federal law again and again.  Ditto her husband.  She and Bill sold the policy of the US government for money to foreign interests.  She broke the Federal Records Act.  She destroyed evidence under Federal investigation and obstructed justice.  And she has improperly handled classified information in the course of her Federal employment.  So Trump is crude.  So what.  The Clinton Crime Family should be jailed.  To play favorites for the politically connected (and I’m talking about you James Comey) is what makes a Banana Republic.  That’s what’s at stake folks.

As the November elections veer closer, the topic on most people’s minds is the presidential race. However, in California, there are many important issues to vote on in down ballot elections, including the state’s stance on the controversial Citizens United v. FEC case, bilingual education in public schools and a repeal of the death penalty — to name a few.

One proposition that will have a tremendous impact on the criminal justice system, public safety and the state of California’s economy is Proposition 57. The ballot measure, a proposed reformation of California’s parole system, aims to address the court order to reduce the costly prison population. The primary component of this ballot measure is that judges, rather than prosecutors, can choose whether a juvenile is tried as an adult. This proposition absolutely must be passed, both for fiscal reasons of practicality and obvious moral grounds.
According to the California Office of the Attorney General, by reducing prison population through increased paroles granted, tens to hundreds of millions of dollars would be saved annually. This proposal should please even the fiscal conservatives who constantly proclaim their disdain toward the use of tax dollars for public good. According to the Religious Action Center, In 2014, it was reported that California spends nearly 10 percent of its general fund on our prison system. Taxpayer money will no longer be poured into the multimillion-dollar prison industrial system. Instead, the system of reformation is projected to limit juvenile prison convictions and cycles of criminalization beginning at a young age. This piece of legislation is essential in promoting rehabilitation in California and reducing cycles of incarceration which debilitate our youth.
Prosecutors and criminal justice officials from all over the state are weary of parole reforms because of the potential for rapists, arsonists or other violent criminals to be released under this policy. Among the dissenters include Breitbart News Network, the online news forum where current Trump Campaign CEO Stephen Bannon is executive chairman. One columnist begins by touting that violent crime has increased 10 percent in the past year and that this ballot measure will only worsen the situation by allowing the early release of violent criminals. This is simply not true.
To quote the report he cited, “In 2015, the total violent offense arrest rate increased 1.0 percent.” And in fact when compared to violent and property crime over time, rates are 2.9 and .4 percent lower than 2010 and about half of what was recorded 20 years ago.
According to the report, the most outstanding data shows that violent crime is not rising, but rather hate crimes have increased exponentially more, particularly events involving religious bias. Hate crime events increased over 10 percent in 2015, and events involving religious bias increased almost 50 percent. Among increased targeting groups are Muslims, Jews and Hispanics. Consistently, hate crimes with anti-black motivations continue to have the highest rates. These statistics are truly appalling.
The issue is not violent offenders, but the increasing normalization of bigoted and racist actions against African Americans, Latinos, Muslims and every other targeted minority — who, not by chance, are disproportionately represented in the prison population.
To name a few endorsees of the ballot initiative, The Bakersfield Californian and the San Francisco Chronicle both published statements of support for the proposed legislation. As the San Francisco Chronicle said in their article recommending Yes on Prop 57, “It’s not a get-out-of-jail free card” but rather an opportunity for inmates to get back their life and return to become valued members of society.
Under this legislation, criminals will still serve their time, but they will not have to pay for it for the rest of their lives. While serving time they will be able to participate in programs including college curriculum, drug treatment and more intensive mental health programs. Not only will inmates benefit from these opportunities, they will also be more incentivized to participate if they receive credit that allows them to go before the parole board. The prospect of getting parole rather than serving a full sentence is not only attractive to the inmate, but should be for every taxpayer in California.
Additionally, if the measure passes and judges are given the choice to choose to try 14- and 15-year-olds in court as juveniles rather than adults, judges have the opportunity to truly change the fate of these youth. If tried as a juvenile, the offender can go through rehabilitation and turn their life around. They will not live with the stigma of a prison record for the rest of their life. But if they are tried as an adult, youth are thrown into a system which few can recover from.
California has a serious decision to make. We must support progressive rehabilitation of the community, rather than allowing non-violent offenders waste their lives in prison.
