When you think of a USC fraternity or sorority, what’s your first reaction? Most perceptions of Greek life involve excessive alcohol consumption, money spent on gratuitous partying, hazing of members and other negative stereotypes.
Last weekend I affirmed that these perceptions are often hyperbolic truths that can be attributed to any campus group but unfairly shadow the Greek system. In reality, Greek organizations might do more to benefit the community than the rest of us.
I attended a party at a fraternity house Saturday that showed me how truly generous and caring the Greek community can be. In a matter of weeks, the fraternity — Sigma Alpha Mu — jumped on the bandwagon and co-sponsored an event to help victims of genocide in Sudan.
For two and a half months, the USC Fight On for Darfur organization struggled to put on its “Dance for Darfur” event. Its goal was to raise donations for the people in refugee camps in Darfur by charging students an entry fee for the party. The only problem was it could not find a venue to host the event.
Sigma Alpha Mu stepped in and allowed the Darfur organization to use its house as the venue. In addition to this already kind gesture, the fraternity used its own funds to rent portable outhouses and security guards for the night. With the fraternity’s help, USC Fight On for Darfur raised more than $1,000 to donate to the Jewish World Watch Solar Cooker Project, which provides women in refugee camps a means to prepare their food without requiring them to leave the camp for firewood, which would put them in danger.
By participating in these charitable events, fraternity and sorority members shine. They are allowed to do what they love — such as organize concerts, work with children or play sports — all for the betterment of the community.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
In addition to smaller in-house events such as “Dance for Darfur” and house-specific philanthropies, every year several fraternities and sororities participate in Relay for Life, a 24-hour walk to raise money for cancer research, and Songfest, a performing arts show that donates its proceeds to Troy Camp. These types of events not only help those in need but give USC a positive reputation within the community.
The Greek system is not all about drinking and partying, and The Row should not be labeled or stereotyped for engaging in typical college social activities. Its philanthropic events alone display a sophistication and class among the Greek community and the creativity and effort it utilizes to help others.
Every semester, Greek students pay membership dues to their respective fraternities and sororities. So where does the money go? The organizations break up their finances to pay for social events, recruitment, philanthropies and other activities.
According to Tyler Vanstory, the philanthropy chair of USC’s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, the fraternity spent between $10,000 and $12,000 of membership dues on philanthropic events in 2009.
So the next time you think how awful it is that so much money is wasted on alcohol and music for parties, think of it this way: If fraternities are spending “x” amount on booze — which we know to be a lot of funds — then they must be spending at least a fraction of that on commendable and noteworthy events, which turns out to be a sizable amount of money. And what’s more, they use those funds to raise more money for deserving and noteworthy causes.
Rather than dwelling on the reckless “frat-tastic” image they sometimes send out, give them a break and join in on the fun every once in a while.
With all the good they partake in, it’s time we start associating the Greek system with some positive qualities such as generosity and hard work.
Despite the preconceived notions many have, the Greek community is doing its part to help make a difference.

Biased or not hopefully this will be an inspiration so that others will be interested in doing good deeds as well.
She is not inferring. She is implying. And she is right–this article is inherently biased. The fraternity is an all-Jewish frat. Nisimov is heavily involved with Jewish and Israeli groups at USC. She has friends in the frat. So yes, the article is very biased.
Then again, most of the things Nisimov writes err on the side of bias.
Ps. Despite the bias, the frat does deserve recognition for the fantastic work they did with Dance for Darfur. They were wonderful, and they went way above and beyond what was expected. So yes, they absolutely deserve recognition and gratitude.
Jessie, what are you trying to infer?
I can’t help but think there is some self-interest/bias at play here with your focus on Sigma Alpha Mu.

The first thing I noticed when USC released its men’s basketball schedule was that odd date for the Trojans to host UCLA.
Hey, isn’t that Valentine’s Day?
The scheduling didn’t make sense at first, but now I think I get it.
This is a rivalry game that needs to be shown some love.
Based on the hype for Sunday’s contest, you would hardly know this is a matchup between two teams who are part of a five-school logjam for second place in the Pac-10. But it’s understandable why there has been so little buildup to the season’s second showing of the teams. 
Whatever mid-season momentum the Trojans had built up was sapped dry by self-imposed sanctions, effectively squashing any mass public interest in the program. And it’s well established that this UCLA team won’t be mistaken for any of the school’s past powerhouses.
The Pac-10 is increasingly looking like a one-bid league for the NCAA tournament — and in all likelihood, neither one of these schools is going to be that team.
But with no postseason in play for USC, the team has had to find alternate motivations to keep from derailing this season. As far as intrinsic value goes, beating a rival in the Galen Center for the first time has to rank pretty high.
Yes, for all those millions of dollars spent on the facility, the Trojans still haven’t had their golden moment at home against the Bruins — 0-3 in the last three years of hosting the Bruins at the Galen Center. And over the years, heartbreak has been present in all its forms.
Homecourt advantage · The Galen Center will host its fourth USC-UCLA men’s basketball game this Sunday but has yet to see a Trojan victory. USC is at 45-10 at the Galen Center against all other opponents. - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
USC’s closest bout was its opening one. In 2007, the Trojans looked poised to capture that signature win at the Galen Center after Nick Young converted a four-point play. But Arron Afflalo sank a mid-range jumper with four seconds left to put USC back in its place.
The hype was ripe the following year, when the Trojans had already taken down UCLA at Pauley Pavilion entering the return trip to Galen. But a packed house watched USC’s supernova during a 56-46 drubbing that featured 10 turnovers from O.J. Mayo alone.
Even last year when the Trojans kept pace until the end, the Bruins proved to be too much down the stretch and won by four points on the heels of stellar outings by Darren Collison and Nikola Dragovic.
An all-encapsulating moment occurred during that game when UCLA forward Drew Gordon hit USC guard Daniel Hackett in the jaw with his elbow. No matter the process, the last three years of rivalry games at Galen Center have been an ongoing series of elbows to the face for USC.
“I don’t know if he did it on purpose,” Hackett said after the game, “but that’s USC-UCLA stuff.”
Unless the Trojans finish the regular season in first place in the Pac-10, this season will be forgotten by most because of the assured lack of postseason play. But if USC can beat the Bruins at the Galen Center, it would give the team an accomplishment no one can take away.
A win would also help fulfill that whole “if you build it, they will come” philosophy everyone had about popularizing USC basketball with this arena. Maybe the sport will never be fully embraced by the school, but fans need to have a reason to believe they won’t leave disappointed from the one game that’s well attended all year.
It’s easy to devalue the meaning of this game given that UCLA is but a shell of its former self. But the importance of this contest is as much about branding as it is about results.
You can drop nine figures on a basketball arena, but you can’t buy legitimacy.
With only so much to play for this year, the Trojans have to focus on building for the future. And a good way to start that construction project would be for the Trojans to get that first win against UCLA in their own building.

Finally, the No. 2 USC men’s volleyball team is back.
After playing three straight five-set matches on the road and going 1-2 in those contests, the Trojans  (7-3, 5-2) open up a season-long seven-game homestand Friday night against No. 7 Pepperdine.
Homeward bound · Sophomore libero Andrew Pizula and the Trojans get a chance to play at home after spending three weeks on the road. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“I almost forgot what it feels like. It’s definitely going to be nice to be at Galen again,” junior middle blocker Austin Zahn said. “That was the longest road trip in front of packed houses everywhere we went. It’s gonna be nice to be able to control our momentum that comes from being at home.”
The Waves (4-4, 4-3) beat the Trojans two weeks ago in Malibu, Calif. in a five-set match in which USC held a 2-1 lead, handing the Trojans their first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation loss of the season. Back then, Pepperdine was 1-4. Now, the Waves have reeled off three straight wins, including victories over two different No. 1 teams — USC and Cal State Northridge.
“We got to go into it with the mental edge that we’re going to stick it to these guys this time,” Zahn said. “It’s one of those things that you try to prepare yourself as best you can, but, when you’re in the game, you hope it doesn’t come down to stupid mental errors.”
Those mental errors are what troubled USC two weeks ago. The Trojans had a a chance to close the Waves late in the fourth set but failed to do so. The same thing happened at CSUN the following week in the game’s first set.
Knowing this, the Trojans have been working on their mentality all week.
“A lot of times it’s lapses in focus. We build a lead, relax and the other team comes back and scores three or four points in a row,” junior opposite hitter Murphy Troy said.
This also brings up the fact that the Trojans haven’t been able to put away break point chances — something that cost them during their two-match losing streak.
USC is second in the conference in digs (10.80 per game) and third in the league in opponent hitting percentage (.254) but 11th in kills (14.80 per game). The Trojans are getting the deflections and slowing teams down, but they just haven’t been able to put the point away with the kill.
“We’re getting those opportunities to hit the swing, but we just aren’t converting them,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We had four opportunities versus Pepperdine in that fourth set to get a break point, but our transition game just needs to get better.”
One thing Ferguson is trying to do to help the transition game is getting freshman Clay Knapp more playing time in the libero position. Knapp started last game against UC Santa Barbara, recording nine digs and playing all five sets.
He will start his second game in a row over sophomore Andrew Pizula, who has been getting the majority of the playing time this year.
“There really isn’t any statistical difference between Clay and Andrew, but we feel there’s just a better flow when Clay is on the court,” Ferguson said. “He came on in the third, fourth and fifth sets against Northridge and then played against Santa Barbara and played really well. When he’s been in, there’s been positive flow, and we are just going to ride it.”
If the Trojans do ride that positive flow to a three-set victory Friday, there will be a reward that most players on the team long for. Like the New York Yankees, the team has a no-beard policy.
“If we get the three-set win, the guys don’t have to shave for a week,” Ferguson said.

The No. 9 USC women’s golf team began its spring season the same way it began its fall season, by picking up its second win of the 2009-2010 season with a three-stroke victory over No. 13 Pepperdine at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
Rough start · Sophomore Jennifer Song started her final round 5-over-par through six holes but was able to rebound over her next 12 holes, shooting 4-under-par to close out her round at 1-under-par. Song finished tied for second among individual scores. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The Women of Troy finished at 24-over-par 876 (284-296-296) at the Palos Verdes Golf Club in Palos Verdes, Calif.
They led every day for a wire-to-wire victory, their first win since the Mason Rudolph Championship in September 2009 and their first such win since the 2008 NCAA championship.
The Women of Troy placed three golfers in the top 15 on their way to first place, led by sophomore Jennifer Song.
Song, the No. 1 golfer in the country, tied for second at 1-over-par 214 (67-75-72), three strokes behind of Pepperdine’s Lisa McCloskey. After a shaky start of five bogeys through six holes, Song finished with four birdies through the last 12.
“I kind of struggled with the first six, but I started making par and I came back from it,” Song said.
Having won both two tournaments she played in the fall, a tie for second is the worst finish of Song’s season.
“I feel happy about it [finishing second] because I know what I need to work on, and I know that, if I do, I’ll be on the top,” Song said.
Junior Lizette Salas continued her climb up the leaderboard to finish fifth at 5-over-par 217 (72-73-73), making her the only scoring team member to improve her standing in the tournament every round. Her scores remained constant despite a variety of conditions, including heavy rain that caused an hour-and-a-half delay in the second round. At one point in the final round, Salas was 1-under-par, but four bogeys over her last seven holes knocked her back down to fifth.
Senior Belen Mozo bounced back from an uncharacteristic round two to finish tied for 12th at 10-over-par 223 (69-79-75). Mozo saw limited action in the fall because of the lingering effects of a shoulder injury but appears healthy for the spring.
“She hung in there, and she played well,” said USC coach Andrea Gaston. “She knows she has some things to work on.”
Sophomore Inah Park finished tied for 33rd at 16-over-par 229, good for fourth among the Women of Troy. Though she shot even par on the back nine in the final round, five bogeys on the front nine threw her round off. Like her team’s as a whole, Park’s finish is her best since the Mason Rudolph Championship.
Senior Caroline Kim rounded out the team’s scoring members in a tie for 38th at 17-over-par 230 (76-73-81). Kim played consistently throughout the final round until she hit a triple bogey on the first hole. Since tee times were in a shotgun format, Kim started on the fourth hole.
Tied with Kim at 38th was freshman Cyna Rodriguez            (74-82-74). Rodriguez and senior Stefanie Endstrasser played as individuals whose scores did not count toward the overall team score. Endstrasser tied for 54th at 21-over-par 234 (77-82-75).
The Women of Troy will continue their spring season at the Wildcat Invitational in Tuscon, Ariz. on Feb. 22 and 23.
Until then, Gaston is looking forward to “a few days of nice weather.” The recent rain in Los Angeles has prevented the team from going out and playing frequently, and the good weather will be a welcome opportunity to practice.

The Indianapolis Colts were not the only team to fumble a grand opportunity on Super Bowl Sunday — so did the United States Census Bureau. Using $2.5 million of taxpayer money, the bureau ran a commercial spot intended to inform the largest American television audience ever of the importance and simplicity of the 2010 Census. But the 30-second advertisement did neither.
Deb Berman | Daily Trojan
The commercial, directed by the generally funny Christopher Guest (Best in Show and A Mighty Wind) is a sloppy mix of B-list actors and disconnected dialogue with little relevancy to the U.S. Census, save for the plug of the bureau’s website at the end of a disconcerting 30 seconds.
Viewers agreed. A Wall Street Journal poll slotted the commercial as third in the “Worst Super Bowl Ads of 2010.”
Conservative talking heads spun the ad as another example of government waste and evidence that President Barack Obama does not care about the deficit. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Tweeted, “We shouldn’t be wasting 2.5 million taxpayer dollars to compete with ads for Doritos!” Later, McCain extended his criticism of the ad stating, “The census happens every 10 years. Everybody knows it happens.”
What both parties failed to realize was that a Super Bowl commercial advertising the census was a great idea and a sound economic decision — the execution was just terrible.
Despite McCain’s belief, many do not participate in the census. According to the bureau, there was only a 65 percent mail response. Latino and immigrant communities have been traditionally wary of filling out the government document because of language barriers and fear of deportation. Census officials estimate that roughly 5 percent of the Latino population alone might not have been accounted for.
Underrepresentation has huge implications for Los Angeles County, where almost half the population is Latino and more than one-third of residents are immigrants. Census findings determine representation in Congress and how much of $435 billion in federal funds a city and state will receive for social services. The money is used for hospitals, schools, job training centers and other public service projects that improve the quality of life for Angelenos.
Los Angeles lost millions of dollars in federal funds in 2000 because of incomplete census forms. Many attributed this to the unwillingness of underserviced communities to complete the document.
Taxpayers lost even more money when federal officials attempted to track down those who didn’t complete the form. For every 1 percent of the population that doesn’t mail back the census, the federal government loses $85 million in revenue, according to the bureau.
Because of this, the Census Bureau invested almost $100 million in advertising that teaches minority communities how to complete the census. Advertisements on Univision and even a character on a popular telenovela casted as a census worker are just some of the ways the bureau has attempted to reach Latinos. From this, it is evident why the bureau would invest in a Super Bowl commercial that costs $2.5 million yet has the ability to save taxpayers exponentially. But the opportunity may have slipped through its hands, because the advertisement was a flop.
A public service style message with Spanish subtitles from President Barack Obama, an esteemed celebrity or even Colts quarterback Peyton Manning could have educated a diverse audience on the importance of the census. Viewers could have been told that the census takes only five minutes, has just 10 questions (the shortest ever) and for the first time is available in both Spanish and English.
Stand up and be counted — you won’t even have to leave your couch.

A few days ago, I tried to persuade a friend to take the bus with me to run some errands off campus. The reluctant response I got was one I’ve been hearing since my first visit to USC.
“Dude. There are some really sketchy people around here.”
I won’t attempt to deny that the South Los Angeles neighborhood punctuated by our red brick-and-ivy campus is not exactly the Hamptons. But I can’t get past the idea that it gets a worse rap than it necessarily deserves because it’s a working-class community, and maybe it’s different from what we were used to at home. We judge it for that. Unfortunately, we tend to apply the same preconceptions to people.
When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the failed Nigerian Christmas Day bomber, was taken into federal custody, it didn’t take long for Republicans to start blasting the way the government treated him, which they felt was lenient and not appropriate when addressing a terrorist threat to national security.
Abdulmutallab’s case has been handled judiciously and within the confines of the law. Still, many feel that it is not good enough for a situation such as this.
The reason for our discomfort is obvious: Abdulmutallab is a terrorist, and terrorist attacks often make us so nervous as to forget that we are a nation that tries every individual fairly and by the same set of laws.
America’s fear of foreigners, especially Muslims — a xenophobia found close to home, as well — often causes us to try to ignore the very rights and liberties that we claim separate us from them.
The obstructionist-type critics who have condemned the Obama administration’s handling of the incident have been so eager to protect our country from people like Abdulmutallab that they have overlooked a lack of constitutional basis for their claims.
Consider their main arguments: The defendant was to be tried in a civilian court, not a military one, and that he was read his Miranda rights.
Let’s take a moment here.  
Abdulmutallab is a civilian accused of breaking civilian law on U.S. territory. He didn’t perform a military attack, he wasn’t arrested by the military and he’s not a prisoner of war. There is no constitutional reason that he shouldn’t be tried in a civilian court. This comes down to a case of Republicans trying to push him off into the military system in an attempt to work around the civil rights he would be afforded otherwise.
Miranda rights apply to every defendant accused under our court of law, whether they be terrorists or shoplifters. They can’t be suspended simply because a particular individual makes us more nervous than others. This is a crucial part of our nation’s legal system. It’s what sets us apart from Iran or China — that the person in custody is afforded his basic human rights, no matter who he is, where he’s from or what he’s done.
Our nation prides itself on being unique, on representing fairness and equality. Why not put to use these laws that we are so passionate about defending? Abdulmutallab’s failed attack on Northwest Flight 253, foiled by a defective homemade detonator, was well-documented, with a plane full of witnesses and a syringe full of evidence.
Even in a fair and impartial trial, Miranda rights and all, he is likely to be convicted. And a conviction in such a manner is an opportunity to reinstate in the world’s eyes the idea that, regardless of the background or crimes of the accused, we play by the rules we’ve set for ourselves. To call for unlawful treatment of Abdulmutallab is a waste of that opportunity, recalling instead the less constitutionally supported treatment of prisoners such as those in Guantanamo Bay.
In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, John Brennan, defended the federal government’s conduct, declaring, “we reacted very well to that situation. He was then put into a process that has been the same process that we have used for every other terrorist who has been captured on our soil — whether they be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens.”
This last addendum to his statement is an acknowledgment of the fact that prejudice against foreigners is definitely a pathological issue in cases such as these.
Race and religion are key factors in the critical response that has surrounded Abdulmutallab’s treatment. There’s little point in denying that we as a society get more nervous and demand harsher treatment of an accused terrorist when he’s Muslim.
When Oklahoma City was bombed in 1995, an exhaustive search for the culprit ended in a shocked and confused nation being handed U.S. Army veteran Timothy McVeigh, an Irish Catholic from New York. People had heard the word “terrorism” and automatically looked toward the vague, frightening population of non-white, non-Christian outsiders.
No one demanded that McVeigh’s Miranda rights be suspended.
Brennan was right to defend the actions of our government in this instance. “Counterterrorism professionals deserve the support of our Congress … rather than [Congress] second-guessing what they’re doing on the ground.”
Those professionals acted constitutionally, and any complaints that they did not are the result of either a bias against foreign nationals or the exploitation of that fear for partisan purposes — what Brennan referred to as the “political football” that Republican critics are currently tossing around.
The federal government should be congratulated for conducting Abdulmutallab’s case in a fair and unbiased way, in spite of our painful history with — and nervousness around, — people of his religious background and inclinations. In order to be a nation of equality that we claim to be, we must ensure that the same constitutional rights are granted to every defendant in our court of law, whether we feel safe around them or not.

Hey Diane,
I personally thought what made the U.S. constitution unique for its time was that the founders believed that these unalienable rights applied to all men not just american citizens… “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights”
btw i know i was quoting the declaration…
Hey Diane,
Suspending legal rights for a political agenda is soooo last-administration, dontcha think?
Hey Kastalia sweetie, for better or worse, Tim McVeigh was an AMERICAN CITIZEN. That’s probably why no one demanded his Miranda rights be suspended, doncha think?

Apparently, the sophomore slump does not affect all young upstart bands in today’s evolving music industry. Yeasayer, the talented trio from Brooklyn, has crafted a follow-up to its successful 2007 debut — All Hour Cymbals — that is impossibly fun and brilliantly executed. The band exudes all the irresistible charms that indie groups offer but without the pretentious “hipper-than-thou” attitude that has plagued the egos of the majority of its contemporaries.
Foot-stomping · Filled with infectious beats, Odd Blood is a follow-up to 2007’s All Hour Cymbals. - Photo courtesy of Secretly Canadian  
The dance-floor-loving offspring of Passion Pit and Animal Collective has enjoyed rising popularity because of its ability to stand out from the competition with distinct African and Middle Eastern influences sprinkled throughout its music. In Odd Blood — Yeasayer’s newest album — lead singer Chris Keating’s atmospheric vocals bounce effortlessly off of the group’s psychedelic polyrhythmic pop beats and directly into the hearts of new fans.
For such a strong album however, it starts with little promise for the listener. The opening track, “The Children,” is eerie and unsettling. Cacophonous poundings of what could be imagined as the twisted machinery of a nightmare factory mix with indecipherable, warbling lyrics. The song is a musical mess of epic proportions, and Yeasayer’s botched attempt to create an entrancing experimental opener will unfortunately drive away the casual listener before the first song even comes to a close.
All is forgiven though by the second track, “Ambling Alp.” The lack of confidence displayed in the album’s shaky opener is completely forgotten as the record’s first single quickly establishes Odd Blood’s playful tone and alien soundscape. The song is the type of snappy and lively piece of original music that deserves its place in every music lover’s library. In the chorus, Keating reminds his listeners, You must stick up for yourself, son / Never mind what anybody else done.
Yeasayer’s main struggle throughout the album lies in the band’s inability to produce smooth transitions from its pop-infused songs to its more experimental efforts. Though “Rome” continues the trend of catchy beats that are present in the album’s earlier tracks, Keating’s songwriting weaknesses become distractingly obvious. He seems much more at ease working in the pop genre than trying to imitate the indecipherable phrasings that groups like Animal Collective and Dirty Projectors have perfected. Lyrics such as, Up in a basement / but I’m wearin’ bubble / I’m glad it high heel don’t give fuel to the bubble, come off as cryptic and absurdly ambiguous in their execution.
It is when the band concentrates solely on crafting infectious beats that Odd Blood truly shines. “O.N.E.,” the album’s highlight, is a brilliant tribute to 80s pop with a pulsating polyrhythmic beat that is sure to be fodder for innumerable future D.J. remixes. Yeasayer keeps the energy alive with the following track, “Love Me Girl,” which layers a funky beat with strange animal calls and other pleasantly bizarre noises as background to Keating’s smooth vocals.
Equally worthy of a foot-stomping good time is the confusingly titled “Mondegreen.” A mondegreen is a misinterpretation of words that creates a new meaning in the words’ phrasing. Unfortunately, Keating does not attempt what would have been the interesting task of forming a string of words that would initiate the occurrence of a mondegreen. Instead, the listener is rewarded with the sounds of honky tonk trumpets and handclaps supporting the singer as he belts, Everyone’s talking ‘bout me and my baby making love to the morning light.
Odd Blood’s brisk 40-minute running time is a genius move by Yeasayer. The length is perfect for repeated listens but it will also spark heated demand for the production of another album. Along with the critical and commercial success of Vampire Weekend’s Contra, Yeasayer’s Odd Blood signals a promising new trend in the music industry — namely, the disappearance of the “sophomore slump.” Here’s to hoping that fellow buzz band MGMT will follow in Yeasayer’s triumphant footsteps with its upcoming sophmore album.
Wow what an insightful article! I think that Yeasayer might we worth a listen, just to keep up with my bands. This A.J. guy seems like he really knows what he’s talking about! good reveiw!

This year’s Super Bowl broadcast shattered records by becoming the No. 1 most-watched television program of all time in the United States, kicking the 1983 series finale of M*A*S*H off of its golden pedestal. A grand total of 106.5 million people tuned in to see the Saints beat the Colts,and, though this might be a wild assumption, I am fairly sure that at least some of those viewers were female.
Oh yes, it is true — not all women roll their eyes and huff-and-puff their way through the American holiday that is Super Bowl Sunday. An estimated 40 million women tuned in to watch the game, and guess what? They like sports, they like beer, they like the halftime show ­— and (gasp!) they like watching the highly anticipated, severely overpriced commercials.
So why has the advertising industry failed to acknowledge the female Super Bowl audience year after year? The Super Bowl offers the finest in creative advertising. Each 30-second spot strives to be better than the last, and the ads that debut during those hours often become ingrained in our pop culture (Aflac and “whazzup” should jog your memory). They have become so popular over the course of Super Bowl history that many people look forward to them just as much as the game itself.
Unfortunately, the advertisements consistently seem to stereotype their male viewers and pander to their most primitive instincts and desires. They insult the intelligence of men and every possible feminine characteristic by consistently focusing on advertising topics that deal with female sex objects, dominating wives and grand displays of a Homer Simpson-esque gluttony of beer and junk food.
I typically look forward to the Super Bowl ad lineup, but I have grown weary of seeing the same themes echoed over and over again.
It seems counterintuitive for the advertising companies to blatantly neglect their female market. According to their portrayal of standard American domestic relationships, women are nagging housewives, and men just want to sit around with the guys and belch. But if women presumably do all the shopping, why don’t the companies behind Doritos and Bud Light want to endear themselves to the card-toting gender group instead of the lazy male one?
This year’s collection of advertisements seemed more offensive than those of recent years. Women were physically abused, objectified and negatively depicted — outraging many female viewers and media outlets.
The Focus on the Family ad, which showed Tim Tebow “humorously” tackling his mother, has garnered the most controversy for its loose handling of domestic violence. Although it is disconcerting to see a woman so violently struck down in an advertisement for a religious organization, the outcries seem a bit extreme. At least in the Snickers commercial poor Betty White was tackled just as much as an elderly Abe Vigoda. Because, you know, making fun of old people is just good entertainment.
Then there’s the persistence of the image of the hen-pecked husband. That poor, long-suffering soul who just wants to be left alone. That’s right, men — don’t listen to your wives, don’t take out the trash, be a man. According to Dove, FLO TV and Chrysler, all you need to do to regain your manhood is drop some dollars and buy back your testosterone.
Always working as hard as possible to offend every American each year is the unoriginal GoDaddy.com, which offered up a derogatory commercial. Its ads never focus on what the company does, but rather on how hot its really hot models are. See how hot that girl is? The blonde one is taking down her hair so she can be “too hot for television!” At this point, every male viewer is expected to quietly excuse himself to go somewhere private and cool off because GoDaddy.com is just  that hot.
Sorry GoDaddy.com, Dove, Focus on the Family, et al. — we American females are not so easily conquered. Gender equality might still be in a woeful state, but women are slowly and steadily fighting back. Maybe someday the advertisers will realize they can profit even more by discontinuing their practice of insulting the intelligence and integrity of their Super Bowl fans (men and women alike) and give them commercials that leave them feeling satisfied.
Amy Baack is a senior majoring in cinema-television production.
This is not about being PC, this is about the advertisers being stupid. Many of the Super Bowl commercials were insulting to men as well as women. Take the Dodge Charger “Man’s Last Stand” commercial, for example. Not only does it paint women as overbearing and controlling, but it also portrays men as spineless and “snivleing” [sic]. Maybe instead of buying a car, the men in the commercial could stand up for themselves and actually get what they want out of life. According to Dodge, however, men are just too weak to handle it.
The argument can be extended to several other Super Bowl commercials, including the FLO TV’s shopping spot. And don’t even get me started on Focus on the Family.
In short, Amy – don’t let these bros get you down. I really enjoyed the article. Keep up the good work!
Our entire pop culture is a super let down and Superbowl ads are the epitome of cultural sludge.  Wait….people watch COMMERCIALS for entertainment value? That’s like buying into the car salesman’s entire schtick before he even opens his snout.
haha – what do you want?
a f**king tampon commercial?
For gosh sakes….you are trying way to hard to be complicated and PC. I dont think the commercials are going to start a wave of abuse of women….they are funny, and thats it. stop looking for the “inner meaning” of dumb comedy and grow up. Life is WAY to short to worry about that stuff…and no, childeren and men are not “sent a message” by the commercials. This is the kind of whining that is ruining the country…the attempted feminization of American men. Stop being a weak snivleing individual.

Performing Shakespeare is notoriously difficult to pull off — even more difficult than listening to it. So when the USC School of Theatre’s Masters of Fine Arts in Acting Program class of 2010 learned that it would be staging Shakespeare’s Pericles, Prince of Tyre as one of a series of three student performances, it must have known the challenges that lay ahead. All things considered, its production Pericles was a valiant effort.
Riddle me this · Shakespeare’s play Pericles, Prince of Tyre begins with the title character figuring out the unfortunate answer to a king’s riddle. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Their performance space posed the first of many challenges. The small, cold Scene Dock Theatre put audience members on edge right from the start. When one of the first actors walked out on stage to a lonely chair in the middle of the floor, the lights remained fully lit and the tension in the room seemed to tighten.
King Antiochus (McKinley Belcher III) stared into the theater, holding eye contact with an audience member. Belcher wore a crown and a furry-looking beard with a black tank top and Reebok shoes. Before a word was spoken, an interesting precedent was established: It could already be inferred that the production was not to be a classic rendition of the epic Shakespeare play.
After Antiochus’ entrance, Pericles (Andrew Dits) walked out and proceeded to recite his lines. And at first, that was all he did. The words felt lost in the translation from page to stage, partly because the performance began so abruptly and partly because the words of Shakespeare are about as foreign to a modern audience as an entirely different language would be.
The audience unconsciously began to lean in, as if getting closer to the action would help it decipher what was going on.
But these performers proved their talent within the following scenes, even though the atmosphere was hard to break. Scene Dock’s inescapable emptiness made viewers reluctant to engage and join the actors on their quest through Pericles’ world. But the 11 performers fought hard, feeding off one another’s energy, and, as the performers gradually fell into a place of intimacy, the audience followed.
The plot’s climax blissfully coincided with the peak of the performers’ talent, when Pericles reunited with his daughter Marina (Nicole Maroon). Maroon had a solid performance throughout, showing a consistency of character.
She brought Dits’ Pericles up to her level as they engaged in an emotional and honest scene of a father weeping for the unexpected return of his thought-to-be-dead daughter. The build-up was drawn out to an appropriate length in order to set the stage for a dramatic climax and shift of story. Every eye was drawn in, unable to look away and fully committed to the story being told.
The same cannot be said, however, for the next reunion scene of Pericles and his beloved wife Thaisa (Hong Hoang). For a scene that should have surpassed in emotional relevance — for Thaisa was his one true love and was raised from the dead — the reunion was anticlimactic, short and thoroughly disappointing. There was a moment of brief joy in both of their faces, then the scene was cut and they walked off together as if it had been a couple months of separation instead of years.
But despite the anticlimactic and almost cheesy ending, the depth and raw emotion that drove most of the play made up for it. The MFA students took a difficult Shakespeare play and shook it up, experimenting with simplicity and modernity to create an atmosphere that drew the audience into the imaginary world.

Your article says, “the words of Shakespeare are about as foreign to a modern audience as an entirely different language would be…The audience unconsciously began to lean in, as if getting closer to the action would help it decipher what was going on.”
John McWhorter had an article in the January 2010 American Theater magazine on the difficulty of Shakespeare’s language and why audiences strain to understand. He calls for serious, well-crafted translations. You can read the article at this link: http://tcg.org/publications/at/jan10/shakespeare.cfm.

Valentine’s Day is upon us once again, this time with a well-earned three-day weekend. For many students, this means extra wallowing and maybe a one-night stand or two, but, for those who actually have relationships, the weekend holds a bit more significance and a chance for a romantic evening. But for busy college students, planning a Hallmark-worthy Valentine’s Day can be hard. So what can be done if you’re in a rush? Go online.
No, don’t drop that significant other and sign up for an online dating service — instead use the web to make everything easier for that special day. The Internet is a bottomless well of resources for those in need of a quick fix or a last-minute romantic gesture. Numerous websites offer Valentine’s Day deals and features that make preparing for the day a lot easier.
One of the mainstays of an intimate evening is a romantic dinner. If a nice, popular restaurant is in the works, then book early. Don’t end up with an hour-long wait or, worse, stuck chowing fast food with your lady friend. One of the easiest ways to take care of that reservation is OpenTable.com. The site features an easy-to-use restaurant search that narrows down eateries to the neighborhood and cuisine of choice. Simply choose the desired reservation time and they take care of the rest.
Maybe you and your significant other want to see a movie, but, between meeting that dinner reservation and other commitments, you don’t want to sit through long lines just for the tickets. If that’s the case, check out Moviefone.com and Fandago.com. These two sites offer show times and tickets in advance, so long lines and possible sell-outs for this weekend’s biggest movies don’t end up spoiling the holiday.
A busy schedule can also make it harder to get your partner that gift you’ve been saving up for. Add the fact that many USC students don’t have cars to go to Los Angeles’ shopping centers makes it even harder to get that gift. Instead of tramping across the city by bus, try the Internet.
Many sites offer deals and specials for online orders. Flowerpetal.com offers deals from florists all over Los Angeles and can arrange for delivery too, so you can focus on schoolwork instead of going halfway across town to pick it up.
For those going the traditional route with chocolate, Godiva.com offers a great selection of various chocolate treats with a quick delivery time and prices that won’t break the bank.
If you’re in a hurry and don’t have time for that romantic night or want to send your feelings of love to someone who’s not close by, try an e-card. You can send out that witty, romantic or friendly message without having to go through the hassle of stamps and envelopes. Hallmark offers $1 e-cards on its website, and 123greetings.com offers some for free.
Fear not those in long-distance relationships, there is still a way to have that romantic evening, even if it’s from opposite ends of the world. Get a webcam and sign up for Skype, probably the best video chatting system out there. It might not be face to face, but it’s better than just a phone call.
Also, if you’re looking for something unique and personal to give this Valentine’s Day, try a mix tape. Not an actual cassette tape, though — a modern mixtape. ITunes, the ubiquitous online music store, allows you to gift a music playlist. Simply pay for the songs of your choosing, put together a romantic mix and then send it to your partner. She can wake up on Valentine’s Day with her favorite songs in her iTunes library and a loving message from you.
So don’t let a night with that special someone fall to ruin because of a busy schedule or last minute decision. A little preparation and the relevant websites can make everything right and let you focus on the important things this Valentine’s Day.

While reviewing the elaborate lies on his résumé, Joey from Friends once professed that, if a director needs you to do something, you say you can do it and figure out how to actually do it later. While Joey was not talking about porn, an adult-industry-oriented on-campus event Tuesday night echoed the same mentality.
Both ways · Tuesday’s “Gay For Pay” brought together members of the gay porn industry including three actors of varying sexual orientation. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
As a part of USC’s Five Days of Going Both Ways bisexuality-awareness week, Professor Chris Freeman moderated “‘Gay for Pay’ in the Porn Industry,” a panel that featured working professionals in the increasingly popular gay porn industry. The twist — some of these actors are straight.
Neither excitement nor curiosity was curtailed as actors Nicco Sky, Wolf Hudson and Reese Rideout took the stage in the dimly lit Montgomery Ross Fisher Building to describe their work and answer questions about how they ended up in such unlikely situations. They were accompanied by Kim Kyser and Randy Blue, both of whom are involved in the directing and managerial side of the porn business.
Hudson, who identifies as straight and has been acting in gay porn for about three years, said despite what viewers might assume, the performance itself is “totally non-sexual … It’s always very mechanical.”
As an actor who has worked in both gay and straight porn, Rideout noted that, while his personal relationships are straight, he prefers working in gay porn because the directors and producers are more respectful of the men.
“It’s actually a more comfortable setting. You’re treated more like an actor and less like a prop,” he said.
All the actors agreed that the transition from straight to gay porn acting is not as strange as it seems. They were also adamant in clarifying that, while many actors on that side of the industry are straight, nothing is forced upon them.
Blue, who owns his own gay porn production company, said it is up to the actors to decide whether or not to be in his films.
“If it’s not your thing, it doesn’t make good porn,” he said. “There are a lot of desperate people out there who will do literally anything for quick money. That’s not what we do here … Maybe one out of 100 guys backs out after we hire them. Most people want to do what they’re doing.”
Kyser, who works predominately with a style called reality porn also noted that “actors usually come with a list of dos and don’ts.”
Still, there’s no denying such a lifestyle must have some negative consequences on the panelists’ personal lives. Right?
“As far as your relationships go, you can never tell, at least in the beginning, how someone’s going to react to your job,” Rideout said.
Some panelists had told their families about their work, while others had not. Still, they relayed various anecdotes about their families, which revealed that most of their loved ones were more supportive of their decisions than we might initially think.
For the most part, all five panelists agreed that the impact that working in the gay porn industry has had on their lives has been positive. Sky, a young gay actor who is still relatively new to the business, explained that being in gay porn pushed him to overcome many self-confidence issues that he struggled with as a teenager. The demand of gay porn in particular for a certain kind of physique also introduced him to regular exercise, which he now says “is like therapy for me. It’s definitely a big part of my life since I began working in porn.”
All three actors also agreed that, while porn is an industry in which job security is only guaranteed when young, they don’t feel pressured by the age limits, as they do not see porn as a career.
“I’m not afraid of getting older,” Sky said. “I’m just glad I’m having these experiences while I’m still young.”
Blue said he takes pride in the fact that his work places an emphasis on safe sex and sexual education. The use of condoms is at the actor’s discretion, but he also said it is not uncommon for an actor to leave the job knowing more about safe sex practices than he did before.
The testimonies of the panelists certainly go a long way toward dispelling any notions that straight actors performing in the gay porn business are coerced into doing so or else doing so miserably for the sake of the extra money. The actors are relaxed, the producers are proud of what they create.
“It’s always fun,” Kyser said. “We don’t take ourselves seriously at all”.
The ‘gay porn’ industry is actually crawling with straight guys looking to make money. Yes, there is some fake straight guy porn by some studios looking to cater to that, but alot of it isn’t. Sexual feelings, and committing a sexual act aren’t the same thing. There are gay guys have sex with women, and some of them even enjoy it for what it is, even if sexual attraction isnt involved.
We’re going to need a massive rethinking of sexuality/identity issues, and I find the most resistant to it, are many gay people themselves, and insecure straight males. Interesting
The “Gay For Pay” thing is a mith, they are all gays with no dignity.
Have any of you read the mission statement of the university? Because again I fail to see how glorifying any aspect of the porn industry is contributing to the “noble” goals stated in USC’s own “words.” The “professor” who did this should have to answer for this misuse of the university’s NAME.
To turn this around on you, if you want to watch gay porn, go do so. Don’t have a panel discussion on it and publish it in the newspaper where we all have to read about it too. Seriously, you can’t publicize an event and then get pissed because people comment on it. We have that right, too. 
And PS to “G” — that whole “it’s not a choice” thing is not by any means proven. Repeating it over and over again won’t make it so, either.
Diane, you seem to lead such a sad little life.
You do realize that at least 10 professors at USC perform research and academic analysis of pornography and various aspects of the porn industry? And that TALKING about any issue is NOT the same as “glorifying” it? And that the professor involved was in no way responsible for planning, organizing, or paying for this event?
No one forced you to read this article, princess. You chose to read it of your own free will–and based on your commenting history on this site, you seem to be extremely enthralled with all articles remotely related to GLBT issues. Perhaps you are having a bit of a crisis of identity? A bit “bi-curious” now, are you?
As for the “choice vs. not choice”–you do realize that by calling homosexuality a choice, that (by definition) makes HETEROsexuality a choice as well…So by your standards, heterosexual relationships are just as “unnatural” as any same sex relationships. Oh those unnatural, heterosexual-by-choice heathens!
I didn’t go to the panel but know enough about the industry to tell you that most of what you heard was bullshit.  I think it’s a legit question to ask, why did you have porn performers that identify (publicly at least) as straight? 
I think you can have a good discussion about the industry and their performers but not with this panel.  Considering that Randy Blue’s primary marketing tool is claiming these guys are straight and having gay sex.  In that sense it is a fetish in the respect that some men fetishize straight men and that is the market “Blue” is aiming for.
Was anyone forced to attend this panel discussion? I doubt it. Those people with a stick up their butts need to grow up. Nothing happens in a vacuum, least of all, education. From a sociological and psychological perspective, this subject matter totally appropriate. Way back in the 80’s, as part of a project for a Sexuality and Society course, I moderated a panel discussion on stripping. Some clueless observer could realistically be appalled, and they would remain clueless. This panel wasn’t part of a particular course, so I fail to see what the big deal is. All aspects  of human sexuality are fair game as it applies to understanding the human species. A university is the place where that undertaking can occur without the constraints of some arbitrary moral hang-ups.
Exactly, Jimmy. :) No one was forced or required to attend this event. Nor was it even held at a central location on campus. It was open to anyone who wanted to attend. This campus hosts hundreds of events each semester and people are free to pick and choose which events they want to attend.
So if you don’t want to hear about gay porn, don’t attend the event. It isn’t harming you in any way.
Here is what I don’t get about the program at USC — if the week is about bisexuality, why invite a group of supposedly “straight” guys who have gay sex on film? What does that have to do with healthy attitudes toward bisexuality?
Bisexuality comes in many different combinations.  A bisexual male could have 90% of their sexual and emotional relationships with a person of the opposite sex and maybe 10% of the time with someone of the same sex.  I know many bisexual men who have emotional “dating type” relationships with women, but every once in a while want to have sex with men for the feeling.  If you asked the pornstars what bisexuality is, they’ll probably tell you its 50/50 male and female sexual desire.  That only describes a very small minority of bisexuals. 
It should be noted that Reese Rideout has a conflict of interest since he works for Randy Blue who was also part of this panel. Of course, he’s going to say whatever meme Randy Blue wants him to say since Randy writes the checks.  
How many of these supposedly G4P pornstars have come out of the closet?  Gay porn actor Mason Wyler was marketed as straight by Corbin Fisher.  Gay porn actor Leo Giamani was marketed as straight by Randy Blue, when in real life he’s bisexual. This list could go on and on.
I think they should promote a bestiality week too. Provide some donkey shows, and have a panel discussion to the merits of having a quadruped sexual partner.
“Justmetoo” (I don’t appreciate the name game),
Your student activity fee didn’t pay for this event. It was paid for by the students who were interested in the event and either helped plan it or attended the event. If you don’t like it, fine. Attend a different event and get your money’s worth there.
And sexual orientation is NOT the same as sexual fetishes and paraphilias. Trying to compare any sexual orientation with bestiality is evidence of your astounding ignorance and lack of intelligence, logic, and originality.
What is it that you find so threatening about the Gay for Pay event? Is it that the panelists were men who perform for gay male porn? Would you feel the same way if the panel was made up of women who perform lesbian sex acts for porn? Doubtful.
Same sex relationships are in no way, shape, or form related to pedophilia, bestiality, or any other form of sexual paraphilia. Same sex partners are capable of consenting and entering into legal, binding contracts with each other. They are capable of being in equal, loving relationships and freely consenting to such relationships. None of those characteristics are true of adult-child relationships–or “bestiality.”
As for your suggestion, it sounds like a bestiality event would be far more sexually exciting for you than the gay porn event. Exactly how long have you been fornicating with animals?
College need to stop charging student activities fees for this crap. What a waste of money.
Tim, to an extent, I agree with you. While this specific event perhaps didn’t fit so well with the theme of the week, many of the other events did a great job addressing the issue. This event in and of itself was provocative and informing, even if it wasn’t in keeping with the week.
I am proud of the fact that USC even had a bisexuality awareness week. It is really misunderstood, and it is frustrating to feel like I have to constantly explain myself and my orientation to people who don’t understand. As you said, people assume that being bisexual makes someone hypersexual, when that isn’t true at all. People like Tila Tequila are NOT representative of the majority of bisexual individuals, and it is infuriating to be associated with images like that. Being bisexual does not mean you are overly sexual or that you want to have multiple partners at the same time or that you are incapable of forming committed, monogamous relationships. Being bisexual DOES mean that you could be physically/spiritually/emotionally attracted to someone of either gender–it means that you can fall in love with a man or a woman, that their gender is not the deciding factor in whether or not you have a romantic relationship with them.
I am not ashamed of being bisexual. I am proud of the way GLBTA has brought issues like this to the forefront this year. I am proud of the way they have made LGBT’s feel safer on this campus. Indeed, members of GLBTA are the reason I finally found the courage to come out in the first place. So I am deeply grateful to them for the work they are doing here at USC and the way they are trying to raise awareness and increase the sense of community and safety for LGBT students here.
So props to you, GLBTA. You all are fantastic. :)
The real tragedy here is that bisexuality is often misunderstood, and bisexuals are discriminated against by both gays and straights. This discussion does nothing to further the understanding or advance the dialog about bisexuality. None of the participants even self-identify as bisexual. One of the common misconceptions about bisexuals is that they are hypersexual and will have sex with just about anyone. To hold a panel discussion with straight porn actors who have homosex does nothing to create “bisexuality awareness” only helps to fuel this myth. A major diversity awareness fail for USC.
wolf hudson is lying. reese is lying. they r gay. reese came out at the cybersocket awards and said he’s gay. if u get an erection w/ a guy while having sex and u orgasm from it – u r gay. the allure of the “straight” guy crossing over is completely manufactured. go ask straight guys in porn like keiran lee, james deen or mr. pete if they can get it up with a dude ONLY. no. 
straight men who do straight porn. if they do gay porn, they are not straight. sorry.
hello, i am not a student at the university but i am a huge gay porn fan but i have to say it angers me sometimes when these “gay for pay” actors say that it is all mechanical and not personal.  i have to believe when you are kissing someone and having sex it is not mechanical.  i understand if they have a hard time performing but to use that is a miserable excuse.  reese rideout was “unzipped” magazine’s man of the year in 2009 and he was in numerous clubs and events and was hanging around these clubs getting drunk and partying.  reese is a guy who loves gay porn and really truly speaks highly of it and let’s be clear gay porn is not even talked about half the time and never discussed in the mainstream media.  as to the demeaning part of it i have to say no one is shoving a gun to their heads saying okay you guys will have sex or something bad will happen.  i think it is weird that with the industry that women control the straight side and get paid more then any male actor and when you go into gay porn the man is pay more because gay porn is considered a niche market and not really put out there.  but, when you look at things gay porn does have a great thing going for it because to be honest some women watch gay porn and like the fantasy of two men having sex.  women loved the series “queer as folk”.  i mean there is one bad thing about the gay porn industry that has become very popular over the last few years and that is barebacking.  a lot of new companies are promoting this part of the industry and it is really damaging the people who watch the movies because now they see two men having unprotected sex as opposed to having safe sex.  but, all things considering gay porn is not hurting anyone and if it is a means to take care of bills and to pay for school so be it but i think a lot of these guys are gay and are not willing to accept the lifestyle yet but we will see in the future.
Good for you, Diane.  You stick by your guns, Lady!
The preoccupation with abnormal and foreign life styles is the result of Stephen Sample’s inabilitiy to finish a sentence without using the word, “diversification.”  USC now has a divirsification of everything but a single pillow-fluffing political outlook.  I’m sure glad I’m not having to pay what today’s students have to pay to have the wool pulled over their eyes.  I’d be particularly offended when that wool turned out to be cotton.  Please tell me, Diane, if you ever have a notion to take up with older men.  I have a notion you might work out quite nicely.

Too bad there weren’t people there to call out some of these guys on their BS especially Randy Blue. 80% of gay for pay porn is bs, some companies even have people that will coach you on how to be gay for pay.  Sorry Wolf I’ll take the DaVinchi institute’s study about bisexuality over your manfactured garbage any day. Of the sample group of men they examined more then 75% were aroused by male/male porn while the rest of the men were aroused by only straight porn. Wolf you identified as straight then how come you told Michael Lucas on camera that you were bi and went to clubs to pick up men.  Wolf didn’t start out in straight porn and frankly the only straight porn he does is low budget garbage.  Wolf having sex with men on camera is sexual bub. If you really feel that way then please leave gay porn once and for all. Stop begging your fans to vote for you for every gay award that is out there, stop coming to pride events and please don’t patronize the community by doing the NO8 pictures for publicity.  Once your contract at Cocky Boys ends just leave.
Randy Blue considering you marketed Leo Giamani as a gay for pay man, no one should take a word you say seriously. Rob (his real name) was a out man on the east coast who left his male partner to get into the business. “Many of the actors in gay porn are straight” Oh Randy, why do you continue to to fabricate this stuff.  I’ve seen a number of your performers out a bars, clubs, and around town with boyfriends and their real life voices and demeanor are nothing like what you film on screen.  
Most of the guys that do male/male scenes are gay, claim bi but are gay, addicts, or very very desperate. Sexuality is not discussed and a number of these websites have current/former models act as mentors to these guys to get them to do more sexually.  
I wish someone would have asked about being an escort (prostitute). Most of the men in the gay porn industry are escorts. It would have been fun to have asked the performers about if they were worried about future repercussions from doing porn. One of Mr. Blue’s signature models was begging for money on a porn blog because he couldn’t find work in his previous career due to his involvement in porn.  
About 90% of what you get from the porn world including blogs, websites, and yes probably this forum is made up.  You REALLY don’t want to know the truth about the industry.
This is exactly the kind of “educational activity” that gives rise to scorn directed at academia…and with damn good reason. Pornography is demeaning and inhuman, but even if you think it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread, this is patently ridiculous as an educational event. Good grief. The professor who arranged it has nothing more to offer his students than the insights of gay porn actors? Really? Why even bother getting a degree? You can engage in some socially redeeming pastime (like gay porn) and come share your great wisdom with college students. 
While we’re at it, why a bisexual awareness week? How about a pedophilia awareness week? That’s just a sexual choice, too? Or bestiality week? My point is, why do we have to have a week to celebrate someone’s sexual inclinations? That’s… stupid. Why do we have to hear about who you’re having sex with?
Diane,
While I respect your right to your beliefs, did you at least attend this event?
If not, then how can you say that the event was “uneducational.” 
As someone who was there, the event was in fact academic, and dealt with a provocative subejct matter in an appropriate manner. The professor served only as a moderator and did not arrange the event. Bashing of his background and his degree is completely unwarranted.
Furthermore, and this one might go completely over your head, but sexual orientation is NOT a choice.
Fight on Diane, fight on!

USC is making medical headway right on campus with a new trial seeking to help those suffering from high blood pressure.
Patients with high blood pressure are advised to take necessary steps to decrease their unhealthy numbers. Many patients, however, exhaust the possibilities — which include prescription drugs, workout regimens, and alternative diet plans — and are still unable to decrease the high blood pressure that puts their health at risk.
Now, a groundbreaking trial at USC and other locations could help those who have exhausted their options and still can’t find relief.
The Rheos Baroreflex Hypertension Therapy System consists of a small electronic palate placed underneath the patient’s collarbone. Electric pulses are shot through wires connecting the collarbone to both the right and left carotid arteries igniting the body’s blood pressure control system, which then relays a message to the brain to reduce overall blood pressure.
According to Dr. Mitra Nadim, director of the Hypertension Center, initial results of the procedure have been positive, the Los Angeles Times reported.
In an early trial, patients’ blood pressure dropped on average from 189 to 160 in three months and from 189 to 150 in a year.
According to the LA Times, USC is seeking qualified individuals who suffer from drug resistant hypertension. An eligible patient with a blood pressure higher than 160 and is taking three prescribed medications may qualify for this pioneering procedure.

I understand the pain behind giving something your all only to see it rejected, but after numerous American Idol seasons, I can only take so much of the same. At least things were slightly spiced up last night as Ryan Seacrest told the viewers that the moment that millions of fans have been waiting for with pent up breath has finally arrived — Hollywood Week.
Ellen DeGeneres took her rightful seat at the table of judges that for the last eight seasons has crushed contestant’s dreams and made others’ fantasies a reality. DeGeneres has made a guest judging appearances on other Fox reality programming such as competitive dance show So You Think You Can Dance?, but the point of her presence on Idol — besides comic relief — still eluded many. In a rare serious tone, however, DeGeneres lessened skepticism–mine included–by explaining to the participants that although she lacks musical experience, she understands the pressure of entertaining a crowd and being on stage. Perhaps with this perspective, she can critique the stage presence that gets contestants the furthest besides singing talent.
Indeed, when you are competing against hundreds of contestants to be in the top 12 finalists and then are engulfed by the difficult feat of getting viewers to dial-in and vote for you, you need to have that extra something else. Ellen’s involvement and success in Hollywood equip her perfectly to share insider tips, despite having released no number-one hits. Though I feel she cannot properly judge dancing techniques, she still possesses valuable information about how to hold the attention of an audience–how to entertain. Despite her sincere confession, Ellen’s humorous personality thankfully remained intact throughout the rest of the show. At one point she teasingly told a participant that he seemed like a leopard behind a cage and that there’s a line between “sexy and scary.” Although laced with humor, the comment makes a valid point. When it comes to the world of entertainment, it’s less about what feels right to you and more about what appeals to the audience.
Surprisingly, the cookie-cutter format of the show satisfied me in one respect — there was not too much emphasis on Ellen’s jokes and in the end, I started to forget her presence. After all, the majority of the attention should be on the performers, those average people who somehow gathered the courage to get on a stage in front of four judges and countless viewers watching the television screen. After so many seasons, I found myself unable to disentangle myself from the popular reality show. After all, it showcases the power of music to alter lives and bring together people from a myriad of backgrounds. After one female contestant delivered a melodic performance with her guitar, I found myself clapping from the dinner table.

Just days after possibly losing a commitment from highly touted offensive lineman Seantrel Henderson, USC coach Lane Kiffin may have found a top-flight replacement recruit for his 2010 class.
Safety Latwan Anderson, who had a verbal commitment to West Virginia before national signing day, instead decided to postpone his decision and reopen his recruitment to many of the nation’s top football programs.
After Anderson didn’t sign his letter of intent, Kiffin and USC came calling and the interest seems mutual between Anderson and USC. The all-around athlete and top recruit from the state of Ohio, according to Rivals.com, will reportedly visit campus this upcoming weekend.
Anderson is still considering West Virginia and Ohio State, but hopes to make his decision within the next couple of days, although he has until April 1 to make his decision final.
Anderson also played wide receiver during his days at Glenville Academic Campus in Cleveland, Ohio and is ranked 15th overall in the nation by Rivals.com.
USC’s class already includes a variety of four- and five-star wide receivers and defensive backs, and the addition of Anderson would improve an already highly ranked class for Kiffin and his coaching staff.
Rumor has it Ted Ginn Sr., Latwan’s coach, really wants him to make sure he made the right decision. Tressel has said publicly that Ohio State doesn’t have room for another DB in this class, leaving his last option to USC. LA has said in the past that USC was his dream school, however WVU has been in the lead for his services for months. Kiffin could pull a recruiting miracle, leaving Mountaineer Nation devastated with yet another 5-star decommit. However, USC’s ongoing NCAA investigation figures to way heavily on LA’s final decision, along with close friend and confidant WVU Head Coach Bill Stewart…Stewart gave the thumbs up for LA to visit USC.

Greek students gathered Tuesday evening to discuss perceptions of the Greek community and learn from speakers how they can combat potential stereotypes by giving back to the community and teaching a balanced lifestyle.
Order of Omega, a Greek leadership honor society, sponsored its yearly  “Greek Summit,” and its discussion focused on academics, lifestyle and alcohol consumption in the Greek community.
“Each year we want to have a theme, something we actually fix in the Greek community,” said Nicole Perez, vice president of events for Order of Omega.
Guest speakers gave two separate presentations — one focused on mentoring at local Los Angeles middle schools and the other on occupational therapy — to an audience of about 25 students from various fraternities and sororities.
William Figueroa, program director of Los Angeles Team Mentoring, alongside Kya Kyle, volunteer coordinator, spoke about inspiring Greeks to get out into the community instead of only working on on-campus philanthropy events each semester.
Figueroa and Kyle showed a promotional video for their organization to illustrate the impact mentoring can have on young teenagers who are at usually pivotal stage in their lives to decide if they want to keep going to school or take a different path.
Myka Winder, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, shifted gears at the event to talk about alcohol consumption and how alcohol may affect one’s lifestyle, priorities and goals.
“Thinking about how you want to be perceived and how to combat the image that the Greek system has of being alcohol centered and academically careless,” Winder said.
Winder mentioned a survey that found 75 percent of USC students said they had zero to four drinks the last time they partied. Moreover, she pointed out more than half of the students surveyed perceived the typical USC student had over five drinks the last time they partied. In the Greek community in particular, she said, students think there is more alcohol consumption going on than there actually is.
Winder did note, however, that the study showed that students are more likely to experience binge drinking if they are a member of a sorority or fraternity and new recruits who are typically freshman and are new to living on their own are also likely to abuse alcohol.

It was a monstrosity then, and it’s a monstrosity now.
When the 1985 benefit single “We Are The World” dropped in support of African famine relief, it represented a charity effort as yet unmatched in scale, profile or sheer luminosity — a total of 43 stars were included as either soloists or extras on the recording. The historic track was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie, produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian and was attributed to a collective supergroup called “U.S.A. for Africa,” banded together exclusively for this one recording.
The stars recently aligned — or convened, rather — for another such well-intentioned industry behemoth. On Feb. 1, only four days after the 25th anniversary of the original recording of “We Are The World,” mega-producer Quincy Jones repurposed the already planned recording to benefit Haiti in the wake of its devastating Jan. 12 earthquake. Among the featured artists were resident martian Lil Wayne, jail-bait sensation Justin Bieber, Oscar nominee Jeff Bridges, Canadian rapper Drake, Akon, the incomparable Barbra Streisand, Miley Cyrus, Snoop Dogg, P!nk, Usher, Josh Groban, the performing Jonases, the remaining Jacksons and — dizzyingly enough — many, many more. It is going to be a white-hot mess: how could it come together as anything but?
Anglophiles will delight in another British victory in tastefulness over those brash, rude Yanks. Simon Cowell has produced an all-star charity cover of R.E.M.’s somber “Everybody Hurts,” with proceeds being funneled toward the same end as America’s “We Are The World.” The comparatively less jubilant-sounding “Everybody Hurts” features more than 20 recording stars including Mika, Michael Bublé, Leona Lewis, Kylie Minogue and Cowell’s sweetheart, Susan Boyle.
The video for the song primarily comprises a montage of particularly heartrending footage from the Haitian aftermath, interwoven only occasionally with black and white video of the stars recording their parts in studio. Unlike its showy American counterpart, the emphasis of the British track is on the tragedy, not the celebrities. Overwrought and underdeveloped media-stunts like this generation’s as-yet-unreleased “We Are The World” have long since become the norm, with “let’s-see-how-many-famous-people-we-can-fit-in-one-room” taking precedent over any sort of event with a genuine message. By putting the spotlight on the earthquake’s survivors themselves, “Everybody Hurts” makes Haitian relief seem like a real cause, not just the cause of the hour.
I totally agree! (we Are The World title even sounds tacky: A bunch of Americans claiming “we ARE the World”?

Having been rumored for some time, Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott acknowledged in a news conference Tuesday that the conference is seriously considering expanding to twelve teams.
Scott had called the press together to announce the hiring of former Big XII commissioner Kevin Weiberg as his chief aide, but the conversation quickly turned to what Scott believes would be an opportune time to expand the conference.
Television contract negotiations for the Pac-10 are forthcoming as the conference’s current contract only runs through the 2012 season, and the addition of two teams would help the conference gain an upper hand in negotiations with television networks.
Utah and Brigham Young have emerged as possible candidates, and their possible addition would help the Pac-10 secure viewing audiences across a larger portion of the country.
The addition of two new teams would also allow the conference to hold a title game.
Under current BCS rules, only conferences with 12 teams are allowed to hold conference championship games, a rule which some have criticized for giving conferences like the SEC and Big 12 an upper hand in national title bids with an extra game against a good opponent on their schedule.
Pac-10 school presidents and other officials seem to be behind Scott’s attempt at expansion.
“We have a group of presidents and chancellors who are very engaged,” Scott said. “All of them are very involved concerning an issue as important as possibly expanding the membership.”
The Pac-10 has been a 10-team league since 1978, when they added Arizona and Arizona State of the Western Athletic Conference to the conference.

Similar to last week’s event at the Health Sciences Campus, the 10 doctors from the USC Keck School of Medicine who traveled to Haiti for emergency medical relief will share their experiences on the University Park Campus and are inviting all USC students, faculty and staff to discuss how they can get involved in the rebuilding of Haiti.
The event, “USC’s Response to the Tragedy in Haiti,” is Wednesday from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Salvatori Computer Science Center, room 101. The presentation will have the same structure as last week’s, but this time all members of the USC community are invited. Doctors from the USC + Los Angeles County Haiti Medical Aid Team will share their experiences and photographs from their two weeks’ worth of surgical and medical work in Haiti.
“It’s an attempt to make sure that the broader USC community and our Trojan family actually hear what we were able to do there and learn more about the situation and Haiti, and to the extent that Keck and USC is engaged in the process,” said Dr. Henri Ford, vice dean of medical education for the Keck School and chief of surgery at the Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.
Moreover, Ford said the last event was predominantly aimed at professionals at the Keck School of Medicine. Keck dean Carmen A. Puliafito and others decided it was important to have a similar presentation that would be accessible to all USC students, faculty and staff.
“What we want to do is really broaden the appeal…the rebuilding of Haiti is going to require a herculean effort from the entire international community,” Ford said.
Both Ford and and team leader Dr. Ramon Cestero, Keck School fellow and trauma surgeon at the Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center, will discuss and show the team’s experiences with the public.
After the presentations, Puliafito will moderate an open discussion between the audience and doctors about the next steps the USC community can take to offer support, according to Leslie Ridgeway, director of media relations at the Keck School of Medicine.
Ridgeway said relief effort organizations and student organizations are attending and will invite attendees to learn about donation options as well as other opportunities available to help the relief effort.
Several students have already called Ridgeway who were interested in attending the event, and Dr. Ford expects faculty from USC’s professional schools to attend.
“[Puliafito] has tried to reach out to his colleagues at the various schools, and we’ve talked about it and we think that this is going to be just the opening forum instead of just a meeting,” Ford said.
