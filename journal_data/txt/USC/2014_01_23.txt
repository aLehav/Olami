The 43-year-old Masters of Professional Writing program is slated to shut its doors in May of 2016, but its students and alumni are determined to save the program.
This past November, Steve Kay, the Dean of the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences announced that the program will no longer be accepting incoming students and will graduate its last class in 2016.
In a statement, Kay said that the decision to cut the program was for business reasons.
“I recognize the excellent pedagogy of the MPW program, and have made this determination solely as a business decision,” Kay said. “I have complete confidence in the current program director, Brighde Mullins, and will work in partnership with the program’s leadership and in consultation with college faculty to maintain the high quality of this program through the next couple years as it draws to a close with its final class.”
Howard Ho, our MPW program specialist, said there is some confusion over what Kay referred to as a “business decision.” Students and faculty have received no response from him in inquiries about the reasoning to end the otherwise successful program.
“We are a pretty low maintenance program. In terms of expenses we always come in under budget,” Ho said. “However, we’re not connected to a larger program and I think that perhaps we’re not seen as having an umbrella organization so maybe that’s what the business decision refers to, a reorganization in a certain way, but it’s unclear.”
MPW students and alumni have launched the “Campaign for USC MPW” in order to open a dialogue with Kay about how to preserve the program and how to find a place for it at USC.
The group’s most recent campaign effort is a letter-writing campaign aimed at Dean Kay and the Dornsife administration. They hope to explain the value of the program and how the group is dedicated toward helping the administration find a place for MPW at USC.
“The Dean has not offered any reasoning in his business decision. We have reached out with no response, but we would like to have a discussion and hear an explanation about why the program is closing,” Channing Sarget, a current MPW student and the Campaign for USC MPW chair, said.
One of the benefits of MPW is that it allows students to complete the program over the course of five years, Sargent said. As a working professional, this was one of the unique qualities that led Sargent to USC’s MPW program.
“MPW is so attractive because it is geared toward professionalism, so it allows many working adults to take the time they need to complete the program,” Sargent said.
Doug Greco is one such student who planned to take advantage of MPW’s flexibility. Greco is in his first year of the program, and due to his need to seek employment during the course of completing his degree, he said he depended on the option of completing the degree in up to five years.
“I made the decision to come to USC and pay over  $15,000 a semester in tuition, plus student loans, but that decision was made with the understanding I had five years to complete the program. Now that I have to complete the program in three years it limits my options and makes it much more difficult not having the flexibility that I needed,” Greco said.
Sargent was equally surprised by the dean’s decision.
“I was totally shocked and blindsided by the news. The student body’s perspective was that there has been no sign that our program was in danger, and in fact it was quite the opposite,” Sargent said. “MPW has [an] excellent reputation at the epicenter of the USC and Los Angeles literary communities.”
MPW has over 40 years of graduates, and when the program closes in 2016, we will have no affiliation and no longer a “home” at USC.
What will happen to references and queries for grants and work? What school will we donate money to as alumni? USC is BUILT upon community and the value of its education. MPW alums will have nowhere to go.
We already face challenges explaining our hybrid Masters in Professional Writing degree. After MPW closes, we’ll also find ourselves even more complicated explanations and tap dances, “you see my program was closed.”
I’m a sophomore who was planning on pursuing the MPW as a part of USC’s progressive degree program (wherein one can begin taking graduate courses senior year and reduce one’s time to masters degree). I am currently deferring this school year for personal reasons, to return fall 2014, and to graduate 2017– one year after this program is slated for close. Has anyone thought of beginning a Change.org petition to help save the program? I chose USC largely because of their innovative interdisciplinary mission, and because of the progressive degree and MPW programs. I am very angry that anyone graduating beyond 2016 will be essentially stripped of this opportunity.
I think we’re getting off track responding to someone who clearly knows nothing about our program. We know that if the program had “no reputation” and were, in fact so “vastly overshadowed,” we wouldn’t be getting the opportunities that come to us by virtue of having attended, and our staff would not be chockablock with Guggenheim, Emmy, Academy and other such award winners and nominees. It really isn’t possible for someone who isn’t a multi-genre writer to appreciate what this amazing program has to offer. Yes, there is a film program at USC, but I’m not clear what that has to do with my ability and wish to write film scripts AND other genres. The issue here is that the only outstanding, amazing program of its type in this country (and perhaps in the world), should not go away. It’s not for people who only want to, or are only able to, write in one form (and I applaud that ability–to me a writer is a writer), but the MPW program should continue to exist.
What’s bewildering about the administration’s decision is that they are handling it the way they are.  I mean, it sounds like the students and faculty were given no warning and that the reasons they were given for the program’s closing were vague at best. I don’t understand why the dean doesn’t seem more willing to meet with the students to discuss it.  I mean, they’re still students, don’t they have SOME rights?
mpwhat, why don’t you tell us your affiliation with any of LA’s literary communities, and give us a point of reference for your opinion on the program? That way, we’ll know whether we can put any stock in your comment. As it stands, it looks that you know nothing about MPW. I am a second-year student that applied to and was accepted into each of the MFA programs to which I applied. I chose MPW, and have been continuously thankful that I made such a wise decision. MPW has exceeded all of my desires and expectations for a graduate creative writing program. The faculty is comprised of LA’s top writers; the pedagogy is the embodiment of excellence in education; the curriculum is exciting and challenging. Not only has my writing improved ten fold since being in the program, but my world view has expanded, and my position as a literary artist able to make a living doing what I love has been solidified. I went in to the program as a producer who wanted to finally do what has always been my passion – writing. I am now working on my first book, and am making most of my living (ie, paying my bills), with freelance writing for publications that three years ago I was only dreaming about writing for one day. And I am one of only hundreds of other students/alumni who are living proof of MPW’s excellent recognizability, reputation, and, more importantly, results.
MPWHAT…would you like to share specifically what you mean when you say “MPW has no reputation in either the USC or LA literary communities, etc?” Can you cite a specific example to back this puzzling claim of yours?
I am a USC graduate and have taught writing at other universities and at writer conferences across the US and have written how-to books for writers. I believe writers’ programs are more relevant now than they have ever been before. We need writers who understand the gamut of what it means to write–language, creativity, formatting, editing, marketing, publishing industry idiosyncrasies. To be a fully equipped writer, one needs programs like USC’s. This decision does not fit with what I see as USC’s overall mission.
MPW has no reputation in either the USC or Los Angeles literary communities because it is vastly overshadowed by the multiple literary, creative writing, journalism, and/or film degree programs already and far more recognizably in existence at USC and in Los Angeles. USC is doing the students in this program a favor by saving them the $15,000+ a year they’re spending on a degree that seems invented to anyone more than a mile away from this campus (and most of those on it, as well).
You sound really bitter about not getting admitted to the MPW program.

The Sol Price Center for Social Innovation has been chosen to implement the groundwork for the Los Angeles Promise Zone initiative.
Keeping promises · The Sol Price Center for Social Innovation will lay the groundwork for the Los Angeles Promise Zone initiative. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
In an effort to alleviate poverty, parts of Los Angeles have been designated as “Promise Zones” by the White House, which prioritizes certain cities which apply for federal grants and aid for education, housing and public safety.
The designated parts of Los Angeles include the areas of Pico-Union, Westlake, Koreatown, East Hollywood and Hollywood.
Gary Dean Painter, a professor at the Price School of Public Policy, was the leader of USC’s involvement in this project.
“In our partnership, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the money that will be spent with those grants,” Painter said. “Since the Promise Zones were designated, there is a higher probability that we will be awarded aid.”
Painter’s initial response to the designated areas was tentative.
“I wasn’t privy on the process of how the specific areas were chosen,” Painter said. “We need to fix something that needs to be focused on.”
There has been some outcry about the specific areas designated, and whether targeted aid will help relieve the city’s social issues.
Emily Sommer, a senior majoring in political science and psychology, believes the areas chosen were warranted.
“It doesn’t surprise me that these areas were chosen,” Sommer said. “These are areas that have undergone changes like gentrification and economic development projects over the past 20 years and it is often at the expense of the communities that live there.”
Catherine Schlesinger, a sophomore majoring in business administration, thought Los Angeles was the right choice, but not the specific neighborhoods chosen.
“These areas are probably good areas to receive funding, but I’m surprised that South Los Angeles wasn’t chosen,” Schlesinger said. “I have worked in the surrounding community through the USC Joint Educational Project, and I think that the schools I worked with could benefit from future aid.”
Painter commented on possible challenges with the evaluation process in the future.
“The evaluation process is not an easy one. It is complex to measure the success and outcomes of the grants that will be used in these areas, especially when you have people that move in and out of neighborhoods,” Painter said. “Some grants are harder to evaluate than others.”
It is expected that Los Angeles could receive tens of millions of dollars in funding. The designated Promise Zones will last 10 years.

The USC Rossier School of Education has teamed up with Chadwick International, a Pre-K-12th school in Songdo, South Korea, to expand career opportunities and scholarships to Rossier’s online students located in the area.
The partnership will benefit USC students enrolled in Rossier’s Master’s of Arts in Teaching online program. MAT students located in and around Songdo will be able to complete their student teaching period at Chadwick International and will also be considered for employment once their education is complete.
Chadwick International will also take advantage of the new partnership. Teachers at the school who enroll in Rossier’s MAT program will receive a $5,000 scholarship and gain access to the resources offered by USC, including online seminars and Rossier’s alumni network.
Founded in 2010, Chadwick International is the second campus of the Chadwick School. The first is located in Palos Verdes, Calif. The school has an enrollment of 775 students, from both South Korea and other countries around the world.
This partnership adds to the list of Rossier’s partnerships with other schools that provide support for students pursuing their degrees online. Among the others are the Brawley Union High School District in Brawley, Calif. and the Global Village Academy, a network of four foreign language immersion schools located in Colorado.
Karen Symms Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School, expressed optimism about the new partnership.
“We’re happy to welcome Chadwick International to the USC Rossier Trojan Family. Our partnerships with high quality education systems are critical to the success of our MAT graduates,” she said in a press release. “Chadwick shares Rossier’s vision of preparing and supporting exceptional teachers who can help all students, whatever their circumstances, to learn and succeed.”
Charles Sachs, the head of school at Chadwick International, also praised the new relationship between the two schools in the press release.
“The newly established professional partnership between USC Rossier and Chadwick International in Korea represents an exciting educational synergism,” he said. “Chadwick and USC Rossier understand that the global future depends upon not only successfully preparing today’s students but also investing and training the next generation of teachers and school leaders.”

Six researchers from The Saban Research Institute of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and the Keck School of Medicine of USC have been elected into the Society for Pediatric Research.

To be a member of the society, one must be peer-nominated and then elected.
Election into the society allows researchers to improve their work through conferences and publications in journals.
Some of the elected researchers expressed what this election meant to them and how it is going to affect their research.
“The Society of Pediatric Research is one of the premier elected research societies. It’s an honor to be elected into this society,” said Dr. Vincent Wang, the associate division head for Emergency Medicine at CHLA and a newly elected member into SPR. “It may improve my collaboration with researchers from other institutions. It may also lead to committee involvements nationally and internationally and will hopefully improve my own abilities to do research.”
Toni Frederick, an epidemiologist and research associate professor of Pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine, moved into full-time research on pediatric HIV in 2004.
“It is gratifying recognition to be voted a member of the Society of Pediatric Research,” Frederick said.  “Membership in the SPR will provide access to the ongoing work of leading researchers and opportunities for active engagement in the field,” Frederick said.
Frederick expanded on the benefits of being part of the society.
“The recognition of the Society of Pediatric Research will provide prestigious professional representation that will help us to more effectively advocate on behalf of our patients and research programs.”
Dr. Douglas Vanderbilt, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician at Children’s Hospital and also an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, was excited and honored to be a part of the society.
“It is a tremendous opportunity to be recognized for my important research in optimizing the development of high-risk infants,” Vanderbilt said. “Being a part of this new research community will allow me to see a higher level of excellence in pediatric research.”
Other USC doctors who have been elected include Robinder Khemani, Jamie Wood and Yong-Mi Kim.
Louis LeMesurier, a senior majoring in biological sciences, has volunteered at CHLA and believes that the hospital cares for both its results and its community.
“Its staff is likely to be motivated, competent and caring. These traits can only add to a research society. USC is lucky to have these individuals,”  LeMesurier said.
Virginia Hazarian, a firsty-year graduate student in the gerontology program, thought this news was exciting for both USC and the Children’s Hospital.
“It’s always great hearing about how the Keck School of Medicine contributes to the medical field through its groundbreaking research,” she said. “The fact that six doctors from Children’s Hospital were elected to be in this society is amazing for USC.”

Unlike USC’s men’s basketball team, which earned its first conference win at home on Wednesday night against Cal, the Women of Troy have been rolling in Pac-12 conference play. With a 6-1 conference record contributing to a 13-6 overall mark, the Women of Troy currently stand one spot away from first-place Stanford, who ranks No. 4 in the nation at 17-1 overall.
This weekend, the Women of Troy will be put to the test as they travel north to the Bay Area to take on the No. 4 Cardinal and No. 19 Golden Bears. This Pac-12 road trip should prove to be the team’s toughest pair of games all season.
Heading into the season, though, first-year head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke could not have envisioned a better opportunity to put her alma mater back on the national radar. She sought to change the program’s dynamic into a winning one and her plan   appears to be going well so far.
Winning eight out of their last nine games, with their only loss coming in overtime to Arizona State, the Women of Troy are well on their way to returning to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2006 under Cooper-Dyke. Athletic Director Pat Haden initially hired Cooper-Dyke believing that she could be the one to put the program through a time machine and return it to the glory days of 1983-84 when Cooper-Dyke led the Women of Troy to back-to-back national championships.
This past week, the team received votes in the national polls, and a win against either powerhouse on the road could make a statement to the rest of the Pac-12 — and the country at large — that USC women’s basketball is a force to be reckoned with. Right now the Women of Troy, not the men’s team, are the basketball team to watch on the USC campus.
Though the men’s team is struggling to stay competitive in the tough Pac-12 under first-year head coach Andy Enfield, the Women of Troy are making a much faster transition under their new coaching staff and system.
In  major collegiate athletics  the retention of players is unpredictable and the constant revolving door of talent can make it daunting to rebuild a team. USC has had the talent to be successful for the past few years. Injury problems, however, have prevented the Women of Troy from exercising their full potential.
This year’s roster actually doesn’t look much different than last year’s with the exception of a few freshmen and transfers. The Women of Troy returned 11 players, only losing senior Christina Marinacci to graduation.
Nine of those 11 players started at least seven games during the 2012-2013 campaign. Ninety-one percent of USC’s scoring and 88 percent of the rebounding was produced by those 11 returning players.
Adding to all of this is the return of one of the program’s all-time top players in senior forward Cassie Harberts, who recently surpassed her new coach as USC’s No. 10 all-time leading scorer.
To go with the talent that they brought back, an integral part of the Women of Troy’s success has been that they now have the right coach to pair with that talent.
Former head coach Michael Cooper departed last spring after his first losing season in four years. Cooper was a great WNBA coach for the Sparks, but not even he was able to take the program back to its first NCAA tournament in seven years. Haden proceeded to the coaching carousel and he came away with the right woman for the job.
Unlike the controversial hiring of new head football coach Steve Sarkisian, which many fans would call a base hit, Haden hit a home run with his decision to bring back Cooper-Dyke, who is familiar with the winning tradition of the women’s basketball program at USC. This allows her to relate with her players and bring a unique set of experiences, which is important in women’s college basketball, especially when it comes to recruiting.
To that effect, Cooper-Dyke has already landed four top-notch recruits prior to National Signing Day — three of those players are ranked in espnW HoopGurlz’ Top 100.
By corralling in two five-star recruits led by the nation’s No. 16-ranked recruit in point guard McKenzie Calvert from Schertz, Tex., USC has plunged its way into having the fifteenth-best 2014 recruiting class thus far, according to espnW. They are one of four Pac-12 teams in the espnW top 20 for recruiting.
Cooper-Dyke has developed a reputation for quickly resurrecting college basketball programs. The former Trojan coached at three different programs in seven years before returning to coach at USC, and received three league-wide coach of the year honors in the process. Her 13 wins this season have already surpassed last year’s 11 total wins — with another 11 games remaining on the season.
When Haden brought in men’s coach Andy Enfield on April 1 of last year, he did so in order to instill the sort of basketball culture that our campus seems to be lacking. Cooper-Dyke might  have been hired 10 days later, but she and her team have not wasted any time in bringing back winning basketball to USC.
The USC women’s basketball team is already making a strong case for an NCAA tournament berth this season and racking up highly touted recruits.
The future looks promising for the Women of Troy and their first-year head coach.

After winning four consecutive national championships from 2009-2012, the USC men’s tennis team might consider their 2013 season a disappointment. The Trojans fell in the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament, unable to pull off an unprecedented five-peat.
Back at it · Senior Ray Sarmiento recovered from a foot injury just in time for the Trojans’ 2014 home opener against unranked Santa Clara. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
This season, the No. 4 Trojans hope to return to national prominence and will begin this quest this weekend as they host the ITA Kick-Off Weekend at Marks Stadium.
The men’s tennis team will host the No. 63 Wichita State Shockers, the No. 64 Georgia State Panthers and the unranked Santa Clara Broncos in the tournament, which begins on Saturday.
Should the Trojans come out on top, they will earn a spot in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships next month in Houston, Tex.
Sixty-four teams are competing in similar qualifiers to make it into the ITA Indoors. Last year, the Trojans came out on top of their Kick-Off Weekend tournament, and headed to Seattle for the Indoor Championships.  The Trojans advanced to the finals, falling in the title match to eventual national champion Virginia. This season, they hope to have similar, if not better, results to open up the season.
“Whoever gets through this weekend qualifies for the top 16 teams,” head coach Peter Smith said. “They all meet in Houston in [three weeks]. That’s important for us, that we’re a part of that mix.”
The Trojans are highly motivated to start the season off right with a win this weekend, but ultimately they hope to strengthen their players, new and old, and make each match a learning experience.
“For me, I’m the type of coach that just wants good, hard, tough experiences to make my players better,” Smith said.
The Trojans will aim to remain grounded to the court, and an all-too-familiar one at that. This will be the fifth consecutive ITA Kick-Off weekend held at USC’s Marks Stadium, which the Trojans will try not to take for granted.
“You always want to play in your own living room,” Smith said. “You can get a lot more confidence because you’re used to the conditions here, the way the wind blows, where the sun is [and] the speed of the courts.”
Junior Jonny Wang, ranked No. 67 in the country in singles, is looking to match his accomplishments from the fall season. In October, Wang flexed his muscle in an upset of the then-third-ranked player in the nation — Ohio State’s Peter Kobelt.
Wang insists he and his teammates have maintained an intense workout since then.
“[The] biggest goal is to always improve and get better,” Wang said. “I think we’ve just got to be grounded and focus on improvement.”
Senior Ray Sarmiento and junior Yannick Hanfmann will see their first action of the spring season this weekend after being sidelined by lingering injuries.
Sarmiento is ranked No. 10 in the nation in singles and will play in the top slot in singles throughout the tournament. Hanfmann is the next-highest ranked Trojan singles player at No. 32 in the nation and will play at the two-spot for USC. Sarmiento and Hanfmann will pair up for the top doubles slot as well.
Junior Roberto Quiroz, ranked No. 113 in the nation in singles, will play at the third singles spot for the Trojans and freshman spring enrollee Connor Farren will play at No. 4. Rounding out the singles lineup will be No. 70 Michael Grant and sophomore Max de Vroome.
Following their success early in the spring season, Quiroz and Farren will play at the No. 2 doubles spot. Junior Eric Johnson and sophomore Max de Vroome, who won the ITA Southwest Regional doubles championship last fall, will complete the doubles rotation.
Georgia State and Wichita State will face off Saturday at 8 a.m. at Marks Stadium. Then, USC will battle Santa Clara at 11 a.m. The losers of each match will play at 10 a.m. on Sunday, while the championship match will be held afterward at 1 p.m.

The Women of Troy have a tough road trip ahead of them taking on conference rivals No. 19 Cal and No. 4 Stanford. The team is coming off the high of a win against Oregon in which USC (13-6, 6-1) scored a record-setting 109 points.
Road warrior · Junior forward Alexyz Viaoletama heads into this weekend’s road trip averaging 9.5 points per game and 7.6 rebounds per game. She is second on the team in minutes played, with 28.8 per game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“I see hard work,” said USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. “I see the effort and I see the girls starting to believe in each other and the product we put out.”
USC will have to build off that momentum in order to keep up with some of the toughest teams they will face all season. These games will act as a true litmus test as to where the Women of Troy stand in the Pac-12 conference.
“I think playing away and especially at those gyms is always difficult,” said senior forward Cassie Harberts.
How the Women of Troy prepare is a determining factor in the success they will have against these highly-ranked opponents. Cooper-Dyke said that she has conducted up-tempo practices to prepare her team for the games.
“We are trying to mimic the intensity we’re going to see in the game at practice,” Cooper-Dyke said.
Harberts agrees with her coach’s strategy. The All-American candidate knows the direct effect preparation has on the outcome of games of this caliber.
“You have to know your opponent in and out,” Harberts said. “Plays that they run, player tendencies and the atmosphere you’re walking into.”
The Women of Troy will first face the Cal Bears (13-4, 5-1) who have won the past three meetings against USC, including a 78-59 win in the quarterfinal round of the 2013 Pac-12 Tournament.
Forward Reshanda Gray leads the Bears averaging 16.7 points per game and 7.5 rebounds per game. The Women of Troy will have to contain Gray and Wooden Award candidate Brittany Boyd. The Bears’ point guard is a force, coming off a 24-point game in the win against Arizona.
Once the Women of Troy face the Bears, they will have a two-day break before going up against Stanford (17-1, 6-0), who remains undefeated in conference play.
Cooper-Dyke is among familiar company as fellow Hall of Fame head coach Tara VanDerveer has had extreme success with the Cardinal program.
Forward Chiney Ogwumike is the main contributor to that success. Ogwumike leads Stanford in scoring and rebounding, averaging 27.3 points and 12 rebounds per game, respectively.
She is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the 2014 WNBA draft, meaning the Women of Troy will have to pull out all the stops if they are going to shut her down.
This is where the Women of Troy’s defense-first mindset will surely come in handy. The Women of Troy’s last win against the Cardinal was in 2008. With the recent success Cooper-Dyke and the Women of Troy have had, the Cardinal could very well be on upset alert.
“Winning is a state of mind that we talk about almost every day in practice,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I tell them that it’s a way you should practice, it’s the way that you lace up your shoes before you get on the court and there is a reason why you are out here; now they’re starting to get it.”
The Women of Troy are no strangers to big wins at this point, after beating previously ranked Colorado and a 109-85 win over the Oregon Beavers. Harberts earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for her performance, and can also boast about passing up her head coach Cooper-Dyke on the all-time scoring list.
“I think it’s a huge component,” Harberts said of her teammates’ support. “In my position as a post-player I have to rely on my teammates to do anything effectively.”
Harberts says she would not have been able to do it without the support she gets from her teammates on and off the court.
“We’ve had some players like Kate Oliver, Kaneisha Horn and Alexyz Vaioletama come out and knock down some shots,” Cooper-Dyke said. “It’s really opened things up and not allowed teams to double-team Cassie so much.”
Vaioletama has certainly contributed in recent weeks, and has developed as an offensive threat and top rebounder this season.
If the Women of Troy are going to pull off these road games, “everybody needs to show up from the bench players to the starters,” Harberts said.
An upset is within grasp for the Women of Troy if they continue to consistently apply pressure on defense and allow their offense to thrive by getting every player involved.

Over winter break, I came into the possession of a Los Angeles County Museum of Art pass.
Being the broke college student that I am, I’ve spent a lot of time in recent weeks trolling the LACMA website, looking for exhibits to attend. One show in particular caught my eye: “Fútbol: The Beautiful Game.”
I grew up playing soccer and I’ve always loved art, but I never thought of the two as being particularly connected. In fact, on a superficial level, sports and art are seemingly incredibly disparate. But after digging around a little bit — looking for similar sports-related exhibitions, or other areas of life where the two intersect — I came to realize that there is a good amount of crossover.
“Samuel Ento“, a painting by Kehinde Wiley, is on of the paintings on display at the exhibit. — Photo courtesy of LACMA
Looking toward the semester ahead, I plan to talk about art as a whole (film, television, art, music, literature), what art means to us, how it reflects society and why art itself is important.
These considerations could not be more applicable to the conversation at hand.
How are art and sports connected, if at all? What does this connection mean and what does it tell us about our perceptions of art and sports as a society? With that in mind, there are three main areas of interconnectedness that are particularly striking: sports as the subject of art, the athlete as the artist and sports as an extension of art itself.
“Fútbol: The Beautiful Game,” which opens Feb. 2, is a prime example of sports being the subject of art. It exemplifies this crossover between two areas of our culture. The exhibition, for example, features a portrait of former French soccer star Zinedine Zidane. The piece brings soccer into a long tradition of portraiture.
To Franklin Sirmans, Curator and Department Head of Contemporary Art,  this depiction emits a sense of the “intense hero.” Heroics, of course, are seen in many aspects of life beyond sports, as are some of the greater themes of the show that Sirmans touched on: myth, fantasy, the icon, aspects of the body. More on this later.
Then, there’s the athlete as the artist: Todd Marinovich. Marinovich was essentially bred to be an all-star athlete by his father, Marv. He played as quarterback for USC from 1989 to 1990, but soon left for the NFL. Marinovich’s professional football career was short-lived due to his battle with drug addiction. He eventually turned to art.
Today, Marinovich paints, creating works both related and unrelated to football at his Todd Marinovich Art Gallery. Subject aside, many of Marinovich’s pieces are colorful, somewhat abstract and very expressive.
Sports can also be an extension of art. Consider dance: It’s highly athletic but is also very artistic. Where does one end and the other begin? What exactly is this blurring of lines? Then there’s ESPN’s “Body Issue.” Sports, athletes, they both become the subject of the photograph, but their bodies are also art in and of themselves, highly sculpted and well defined to be presented to the viewer.
Mimicking Michelangelo’s “Pieta”, this photograph turns the bodies of the players into art. — Photo courtesy of LACMA
Additionally, the “Body Issue” resonates with the extensive tradition of nudity in art history. Think: Michelangelo’s “David,” Manet’s “Olympia” and Picasso’s “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon).” Here, Sirmans advises the viewer to be careful because once we start discussing the body, it takes on all these different meanings. But in this discussion, Sirmans brings up the connection between beauty in sports and in art.
“Within the game, there is this idea around beauty and around the human body, as it relates to that,” Sirmans said. “Different people find beauty in different places. I’m interested in how people relate to the exhibition. What is one’s idea of beauty as it relates to the human body?”
Beauty included, there’s a connection here between a number of different things beyond sports and art. As Sirmans touched on, sports carry stories of heroes, adversity, failure, loss and success. We’ve seen these themes throughout art for ages. Again, overlap.
Despite these thematic and artistic connections, we have created boundaries for what “sports” and “art” mean. We have separated the two, categorized them and made them their own very specific entities. If this is truly just a social construct, then why can’t we redefine these words to mean a number of different things?
Sirmans put it best: “For me [the exhibit is] less about it being sports-related as it is about it relating to an aspect of culture that is ripe for exploration on a more influential, educational and entertaining level.”
I’m not sure that I ever really believed that sports and art were so different. I don’t think I put much thought into it until writing this piece. Now I feel that sports and art are really both just aspects of culture. It’s time that we break the divide and consider them as such.

There are few things teenagers today are willing to wait in line nine hours for and those are almost exclusively limited to a new iPhone, a Harry Potter premiere and the gentle flip of Ezra Koenig’s bouncy bangs.
Design by Christina Ellis
At 11 a.m. on Jan. 22, four people sat on Trousdale Parkway, lawn chairs and all, decked in their Modern Vampires of the City paraphernalia. By 4:30 p.m., the measly line had grown significantly.
Vampire Weekend graced USC’s Ronald Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom Wednesday to perform as part of the GRAMMY in the Schools program run by the GRAMMY Foundation, which aims to promote music education for high school students and raises funds for music scholarships in college. The tickets created revenue that will go toward scholarships for high school students interested in studying music.
In addition, the event strived to promote GRAMMY-nominated artists. The company did well in enticing guests to attend by ending its show with an eight-song set by Vampire Weekend. The ballroom was packed with students, parents of the GRAMMY program’s high school performers and special guest Maya Rudolph. Rudolph was a surprise addition to the audience, along with her husband and one of her daughters.
The night began with a lengthy presentation from Ford Motor Company and the GRAMMY foundation. At one point, many Vampire Weekend enthusiasts — along with Rudolph’s daughter — were drifting asleep, feeling conned at what they thought would be a traditional concert. Several performances followed the presentations, consisting of the high school students in the GRAMMY program who displayed their singing and instrumental talent. Even USC students solely present because of their Vampire Weekend fandom had to be impressed by high school student Colby Ewatuya’s moving solo. The execution by each of the GRAMMY in the Schools participants was truly flawless.
“The fact that our money is going towards a cause college kids can relate to and that we get to help high school students afford college while listening to Vampire Weekend is a great system that’s advantageous to us and the GRAMMY Foundation,” said Evelyn Lee, an undeclared freshman.
Tig Notaro, a nominee for Best Comedy Album in the 2014 GRAMMYs, loosened up the crowd with a standup set highlighted by a tale of a chocolate ice cream mustache debacle in Las Vegas.
After much waiting, at about 10 p.m., everyone’s favorite Columbia graduates appeared from behind a cloud of smoke, banging away to “Diane Young.” The audience swayed along, everyone’s hands in the air while screaming “Diane Young won’t change your mind / Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time.”
As the song came to its last beat, Koenig greeted the audience with his East Coast dialect, beginning the never-ending train of “I love you, Ezra” screams from various females in the audience. The band zoomed through itsset, which consisted of “White Sky,” “Unbelievers,” “Holiday,” “Cousins,” “A-Punk,” “Ya Hey” and “Hannah Hunt.”
Traditionally, the band concludes its performance with an upbeat tune, and “Walcott” is usually its song of choice. But yesterday, Vampire Weekend chose to take a different approach. The last song ended the concert on a slower note, as the crowd witnessed Batmanglij’s guitar solo. It was a truly tender moment that brought the diverse audience together. The song marked the climax of the performance, and cherry-faced fans could be spotted with tears rolling down their cheeks. As in every show, Baio threw guitar picks into the crowd to send fans squirming around looking for them. Rudolph’s daughter jumped with joy as she caught one, as every fan in the audience envied her.
What originally seemed unworthy of a nine-hour wait proved to be an unforgettable night as, once again, Vampire Weekend gave a noteworthy performance that pleased fans of all ages while taking them through a whirlwind of a setlist.
Wow this article missed the point that most people in the crowd were duped into purchasing tickets to see an 18 minute set by Vampire weekend.  Yes all were happy to help, but most would not have been there if they were told they would have wait until after 10:10pm just to hear a very short sample of Vampire weekend music.  It was so bad that I was starting to fear for the MC’s safety as many people were booing after the MC started talking down to the audience.
Hey, a well written article! Nice!

They loved it before it even began. When Christopher Plummer took the stage for the Los Angeles premiere of his one-man play A Word or Two at the Ahmanson Theatre on Wednesday, the audience was already on its feet, clapping for a man whose career on stage and screen has spanned more than half a century.
The 84-year-old Plummer acknowledged the welcome with a smile. Plummer treated A Word or Two like an open conversation with the audience, which gave the sizeable Ahmanson a surprisingly intimate feel.
Plummer is no stranger to the Ahmanson, as he performed his Tony Award-winning one-man play Barrymore there nearly two decades ago. Though the venue, which seats 2,000 people, seems an odd choice for a solo show, aided by Robert Brill’s minimalistic set, Plummer plays to the larger setting with ease.
To hear Plummer speak is the real treat. Words roll off his tongue with a masterful elocution as he moves from prose to poetry, interspersing different languages and dialects into his soliloquies. It’s worth it to see A Word or Two just to hear Plummer put new life into old words.
The play does not just rely on Plummer’s delivery, though. There is both a broadness and a specificity to Plummer’s journey, which makes it relatable. He uses the universality of books to talk about his own struggles and joys.
Though A Word or Two can feel a little slow at first, somewhere between discussing religion and sharing his childhood in Toronto, a spell begins to build around Plummer’s words and the play starts to connect itself together, creating something that feels very personal.
It is easy to get caught on a phrase in A Word or Two and drift for a bit with an image, which creates a looseness that invites one to float awhile in a tangent — often a funny one.  Plummer might be 84, but he still understands a good joke.
A Word or Two does have some gaps. It would have been nice to hear more of Plummer’s own thoughts, especially on aging. Despite his age, he comes off as incredibly sprightly. It is no easy feat to go for 80 minutes straight with no intermission. But the production still plays as a chronology of his life and because of that it feels slightly cut short when he only briefly touches on his later years.
Still, it is a great ode to words. Plummer clearly has a deep love of language. Fittingly, the play was first created as a fundraiser for a library in Darien, Conn.
 
A Word or Two will be playing at the Ahmanson Theatre from Jan. 19-Feb. 9.

Last Friday, President Obama delivered a widely publicized   speech on NSA reform, according to the Los Angeles Times. Though the proposed ways to swiftly revamp the intelligence agency are, in principle, a positive step toward transparency, few offer truly workable, effective solutions. In moving forward, conversation should be opened to public debate.
Design by Julien Nicolai
Under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the NSA has been collecting telephone records of Americans. According to the Washington Post, the NSA collects billions of records daily on Americans’ phone calls for the purpose of mapping links among terrorism suspects.
In addressing privacy concerns, President Obama said in his speech, “We will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons.”
The spirit of change for the better seems to resonate with those words. Though it’s true that national security is paramount, surveillance activities such as the bulk collection of this “metadata” need reform. The cloak of secrecy that the agency works under is understandable, but when the program involves such personal information as phone calls to keep records — even if it isn’t call content — the matter should be put up for debate and scrutinized by the public eye.
Though President Obama’s approach to NSA concerns seems fairly progressive, the reforms proposed seem to be more talk than substance. Besides strengthening executive branch oversight and adding restrictions on the government’s ability to investigate communication between Americans and foreign citizens, President Obama still intends to preserve the government’s capability to use the records, only narrowing access with a transition of the bulk collection to a third party. But at face value, that doesn’t really mean much. If anything, it would raise more concerns on the reliability of that third party.
Perhaps the solution is to get rid of the program completely. The proposal seems far-fetched, but looking at the actual effectiveness of the program, scrapping it starts to seem reasonable. In a federal ruling last December that declared the collection of metadata unconstitutional, Judge Richard Leon stated, “The government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.”
The Obama administration has cited 54 terrorist plots by the NSA’s phone call database. Last June, however, when Senator Patrick Leahy questioned NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander on whether only 13 of the 54 cases had any connection at all to the United States, Gen. Alexander admitted that it was true. Perhaps the success and effectiveness of the program has been made to seem like something it really isn’t.
Yet what is certain is that while the spirit of reform is alive and well in President Obama’s address, the actual substance is absent. The President’s new plan has yet to be tested by vigorous public debate. It still lacks the most important factor: the input of the American people.

For many critics of the National Security Agency, President Barack Obama’s speech last week which unveiled new reforms to the government surveillance program, was likely disappointing. Though not without shortfalls, however, these proposed reforms should be seen as a much needed step in the right direction.
Design by Julien Nicolai
In wake of the storm of privacy rights concerns ignited by revelations of mass government electronic surveillance by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, President Obama appointed a task force to review the NSA surveillance program.
In response to the panel’s recommendations, the President delivered a speech to the Justice Department calling for limited government access to the billions of Americans’ phone records collected through the surveillance system, according to the Washington Post. Such reforms would make it compulsory for the government to obtain a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to access these phone records. Other reforms include limiting the scope within which numbers can be reviewed, as well as halting the monitoring on foreign allies.
Many critics of President Obama’s reforms argue that these reforms simply don’t go far enough — that ridding the NSA of the phone database all the while allowing it to retain the vast majority of other intelligence programs, including the government’s access to bulk telephone records (including phone numbers, call durations and locations), or metadata, doesn’t do enough to enact real change.
Yet what people must realize is that the NSA reform President Obama is calling for is exactly that — reform. The measures were never intended to rid the NSA of its intelligence programs deemed vital to ensuring national security.
So rather than asking, “How do we end this program?” The public should start  asking, “How do we control it?”
One recommendation currently in consideration is to transfer the collection and storage of telephone metadata to a third party. In order to do this, President Obama announced a two-step plan: first, limit government oversight over the records currently in its possession and, second, brainstorm ways in which the government can transfer control of the records altogether to a third party.
Though there are still many questions to be answered regarding the scope of certain programs and the implementation of certain reforms, it is wrong to dismiss these proposed reforms as pointless or inadequate. The fact of the matter is that President Obama is ultimately faced with the difficult juggling act of balancing the need for national security with the demands for individual liberties. The decisions taken thus far to address these concerns should be seen as positive steps toward improving an unpopular, but ultimately vital, system.

In conjunction with the Vitebri School of Engineering, Mahta Moghaddam, a professor of electrical engineering, and her research team are working on new imaging and treatment for breast cancer through the use of microwaves.
Breast cancer will affect one in eight women, and it is the second leading cause of death in women, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation’s website. Though risk factors have been identified for breast cancer, researchers are usually unable to pinpoint a single cause of breast cancer.
Research Assistant Professor John Stang, technical lead for the project, noted how past research showed opportunities to use microwaves to both treat and detect breast cancer. He has been working on this project for almost four years.
“Our research started out of research that was done in the late ‘80s or early ‘90s, showing contrast that existed in the microwave properties of breast cancer,” Stang said.
He stressed how breast cancer research is often motivated by emotional intentions.
“Everyone has their own personal relationship with breast cancer, so I think that’s also part of the appeal [of the project],” Stang said.
Stang explained exactly how this new system is utilizing microwaves.
“The system that we are working on now is a combined imagery and therapy system. It is using microwaves, a single modality to do both the image guidance and the therapy,” Stang said.
This new system is proving to be a pioneering technology in the breast cancer field.
“There currently aren’t any systems like that that are using a single modality to guide the focused heating,” Stang said.
The team wants to be able to “cook” the cancerous tissue instead of having to surgically remove it. This will, in turn, reduce the recovery time.
“The system started out as independent projects where we were doing microwave imaging,” Stang said. “The idea was to have an alternative to mammograms.”
The team was motivated to provide an alternative as current mammograms use ionizing radiation, which their innovative cancer treatment would not.
Microwaves are much safer than ionizing radiation, and there would be no pain or discomfort involved with the procedure since the breasts would not need to be flattened as they are in current mammograms. Instead, patients would lie down with their breasts placed in two imaging tunnels.
In addition to Viterbi, the researchers will also work with the Keck School of Medicine and Dr. Eugene Chung, an M.D. who focuses more on the medical aspect of the project.
Currently, the researchers have created a “laboratory prototype,” but this prototype cannot be used in a clinical setting.
“We have explored contracting out a building of something that would be manufactured with a company with medical history,” Stang said. “It is more advantageous to go through a company that has the experience and the track record.”
The laboratory is currently in conversation with a company in order to create the prototype.
The clinical prototype will have amplifiers that lead to several antennae aimed at various angles. These antennae will allow the device to focus the microwaves on specific parts of the breast tissue, allowing the researchers to cook the cancerous tissues the way that a microwave cooks food.
Stang hopes a prototype will be ready for use in a clinical setting in the next few years.
Who owns this technology?  Does USC stand to benefit financially from this discovery in their lab?

Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of the popular website reddit, joined students to discuss his new book, Without Their Permission, as well as his experience with entrepreneurship and the role of the Internet Wednesday night in the Seeley G. Mudd Auditorium.
Entrepreneur · On Wednesday night, reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian expressed to USC students the ups and downs of entrepreneurship. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
Though he is best known for reddit, Ohanian also helped to launch the websites Hipmunk, an online travel search agent, and Breadpig, a “sidekick-for-hire” that, according to the website, assists creators with funding and success.
Ohanian, who is not only an entrepreneur himself but also an investor in more than 60 tech companies, is currently on a North American college tour promoting his new book and encouraging young entrepreneurs everywhere to start building their next company “as soon as they leave this auditorium.”
The founder of reddit.com, not surprisingly, is a huge proponent of utilizing the Internet and taking advantage of the current generation’s constant interaction with digital media.
“We have a certain amount of fluency the incumbents do not have,” Ohanian said.
In addition, Ohanian emphasizes that the Internet is an even playing field, in that everyone has equal access to every link and the Internet is currently “the world’s largest stage” for one to begin his or her own company.
Ohanian described his first startup, My Mobile Menu, as a bittersweet experience. When he and co-founder, Steve Huffman, were called in for an interview by startup financier Y Combinator, they left confident, only to have their idea crushed hours later. Y Combinator, however, was interested in the two recent college grads, and months later the idea of reddit was born.
Ohanian displayed the very first reddit design, which he described as “jenky” and reminded students that every entrepreneur and successful business has to start from somewhere.
“At the end of the day, sucking is the first step to being sort of good at something,” Ohanian said.
Though Reddit’s initial designs were less than extraordinary, the website had more than 100 million page visitors just this past month.
One of Ohanian’s friends, USC alum Ross Boucher, also stepped in to provide students with advice of his own. After working at Apple, Boucher created 280 North, a successful startup that was bought by Motorola.
Like Ohanian, Boucher emphasized spending as much time as possible as soon as possible working on your first start-up.
“If you can devote any amount of time to working on something, that’s great and that’s important,” Boucher said.
At the end of his presentation, Ohanian put up his email address for students to contact him for internship opportunities or any business questions they might have.
“If you all are Lewis and Clark, I’ll be your Sacajawea,” Ohanian said. “I will help you explore this new frontier.”
Several audience members at the event were eager to hear Ohanian in person.
“Alexis has this amazing capacity to instantly connect with his audience when he speaks,” said Stephen Chen, a sophomore majoring in jazz studies. “I’ve watched his videos on YouTube and on the Google for Entrepreneurs channel before, so it was great getting to hear him speak in person at USC.”
