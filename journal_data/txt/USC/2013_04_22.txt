He’s got a firm handshake, a quick answer to every question and an impressive memory. But the most noticeable thing about Dennis Cornell, chief of staff to President C. L. Max Nikias, is his energy.

This energy has been with Cornell from the start. Cornell came to USC after a career in Hollywood, serving as vice president of casting and talent development for Columbia Pictures Television and Sony Pictures Television and working on shows such as “Cheers” and “Who’s the Boss.” He said he just meant to take off one year and teach, but that was in 1991.
“I thought I’ll sort of clear my head, take a break and go back into the television industry,” Cornell said with a chuckle. “And I never went back.”
After serving as the managing director of the School of Dramatic Arts his second through fourth year at USC, he was appointed executive director of University Events. He got to know Nikias when the Viterbi School of Engineering received its naming donation and Cornell planned events for it. A few years later, when Nikias became provost, Cornell helped set up Visions and Voices. And the day he was named president, Nikias called Cornell to ask if he wanted to be chief of staff.
“I’m a believer in my own life about saying ‘yes’ to things,” Cornell said. “If a door opens, you walk through it.”
And now that he’s walked through that door, Cornell doesn’t do much but work, and enthusiastically. He often starts answering emails at 5 a.m. and usually is at his office in Bovard by 8 a.m. If he goes home in the early evening, he said he’ll usually answer emails until 11 p.m., but he’s often working until 9 or 10 at night after events, when he staffs the president.
“The good news is I do get some time on the weekend,” he said, “but it’s not every weekend.”
His week starts on Monday, where he goes over everything Nikias is doing twice: Once with the staff in the president’s office and once with media relations, to go over what will happen at the university for the next few weeks, covering everything from the schedule to speech writing.
“We run a huge organization, a $3.4 billion-a-year operation, which is larger than most cities and some states probably,” Cornell said. “It’s a big place, and a lot can happen here.”
Part of Cornell’s job (and why he spends so much time answering emails) is that chiefs of staff serve as gatekeepers to the president.
“But gatekeeper has a negative connotation, because the point is to keep people out,” Cornell said. “I look at it in a very positive way, which is to let people come to your door, see if you can find a way to solve that problem before it ever has to elevate to a presidential level.”
He said he ensures everyone gets a response, even if the response is just that the letter has been received. Additionally, all correspondence to the president’s office is electronically catalogued, so that a letter sent three years ago could be pulled up with a search for the sender’s name or the subject of the letter. At the same time, USC does have a hierarchy that goes up to the top.
“What’s amazed me about this job, which I didn’t realize when I came on board here before we actually started, is how everything flows right up to the president,” Cornell said. “The buck stops there with him.”
Cornell is also the university’s director of protocol, which means he ensures visitors and guests of the university are treated well and with respect.
“We have a lot of visiting dignitaries,” Cornell said. “Every one of them walks in here and brings a gift — a book or a token from their country — and we reciprocate, and that’s just one part of it.”
Cornell stressed that protocol is especially important when representing USC in foreign nations. His knowledge of this and of Nikias’ vision for the university allows him to occasionally serve as an emissary of the president, most recently to South Korea. And Cornell said the travel, which is usually with Nikias, is one of the best parts of his job.
“I’ve always been someone who’s loved getting on a plane anyway,” Cornell said. “But I really love getting to travel with people and meet people. We really meet the most fascinating people. … The average Joe on the street doesn’t get to do this.”
And the bottomless well of energy from which Cornell draws upon to work has been directed at a variety of causes. Before serving as chief of staff, Cornell also produced seven benefit dinners for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy and lobbying group that promotes the social welfare of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.
“I’m a gay person. And I feel that it’s really important now to make sure that people understand that and know that and know who you are, to take away any fear about being gay,” Cornell said. “Not so much in California or L.A., and certainly not at USC, but there is a world of people out there who are afraid.”
Cornell said he doesn’t have time to organize events for HRC anymore but still supports its mission. And he’s given up other things, such as bowling on Monday nights. He does have a French bulldog (“Napoleon, and he is!”), but the focus of his life is his job.
“I have no time to date really or anything, but I have a beautiful life,” Cornell said. “USC, like every organization, has its quirks and its problems. But when you get down to it, the opportunity here and the people here are incredible.”
And being chief of staff is more than just a job. Cornell said Nikias and his wife, First Lady Niki Nikias, have made him a part of their family.
“Niki calls me her brother because we needle each other like a brother and sister would,” Cornell said. “We’re all around the same age, and we have a simpatico.”
At the end of the day, Cornell said he’s proud to contribute his energy to the university.
“I love USC and it’s taken care of me,” Cornell said, “and I work really hard for it.”
Truly and kind and wonderful man!   Mr. Nikias, USC students and their parents all are privileged to have Mr Cornell working on their behalf!

The Marshall School of Business won the Golden Briefcase on Sunday in its fourth straight Challenge for Charity competition.
C4C is a non-profit organization that focuses on developing a sense of social responsibility within future business leaders. This competition raised $186,500 for three charities: the Special Olympics, A Better L.A. and Junior Achievement.
The Golden Briefcase is awarded during the C4C Weekend’s final ceremony, which was held at Stanford University April 19-20 with more than 13,000 MBA students attending the event. Schools were judged based on the most hours volunteered on a per-student basis, the most funds raised on a per-student basis throughout the year and students’ athletic performance during team events.
Marshall C4C Co-Chair Rachael Stoddard, a second-year in the Master’s of business administration, said the experience of winning was more than a competition — the victory also brought the chapter closer together.
“The selflessness from being willing to give up your time shows what kind of a person you are and translates into conversations with employers, which I think is an important quality to a business,” Stoddard said.
The USC chapter of C4C is led by three co-chairs: Stoddard, Winton Ng and Britt McEachern, all of who are second-year MBA students.
Stoddard said USC outfundraised both Stanford and UCLA on a per-capita and per number basis. Stanford came in second place to USC by raising $130,000. When broken down, each member of the USC chapter raised $344.
The Marshall team competed against eight of the top MBA programs on the West Coast: Pepperdine, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, University of San Francisco and University of Washington.
First-year students volunteered, fundraised and networked within Marshall, hosting events to raise money for their supported charities. The hours of these events were then recorded and used in the final tally of community-service hours, which were then used to determine the winner at the end of the year.
Stoddard said the chapter used both traditional fundraising methods and more social elements, such as hosting tailgates and dances, to draw in students outside of Marshall.
The chapter plans to make its presence stronger within Marshall, beginning with Marshall Dean James Ellis: Ellis will bring the briefcase to graduation, using it to carry his speech.

The runoff election for Los Angeles mayor took center stage Monday night at the first of two mayoral debates to be hosted by the University of Southern California.
City Councilman Eric Garcetti and City Controller Wendy Greuel faced off at the debate, held at Louis B. Mayer Auditorium on USC’s Health Sciences Campus. The debate was co-hosted by NBC4 and its Spanish-language partner, Telemundo52, along with KPCC 89.3 and the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
NBC4 chief political reporter Conan Nolan moderated the debate and was joined on stage by three panelists who presented questions throughout the debate: Jack H. Knott, dean of USC Price; Frank Stoltze, KPCC crime and politics reporter; and Ana Patricia Candiani, Telemundo52 news anchor.

The debate covered a wide range of issues facing the city, including jobs and the economy, pension reform, a growing budget problem, education policy, public transportation and safety.
For two candidates who many view to be similar on policy, each went into Monday night’s debate hoping to draw distinctions in leadership qualities and communication skills.
For Greuel, who trailed Garcetti by 10 points in a Price/Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday, the importance of last night’s debate could not be overstated.
Early on, Greuel demonstrated a strategy built on personal experience and highlighting the failures of her opponent. Greuel singled out what she called mishaps during Garcetti’s city-council term in her first two opportunities to speak.
At other times, Greuel heavily cited her experience in the public and private sector and the endorsement of her campaign by former President Bill Clinton, but had to be redirected to the question at hand on more than one occasion by the panelists.
Garcetti also openly criticized Greuel for what he felt were personal attacks.
“These personal attacks are the signs of a desperate and losing campaign,” Garcetti said. “Let’s get back to the issues.”
Garcetti drew on his tenure as city councilman to boost his record, particularly on the issue of the Los Angeles economy. Garcetti also demonstrated a focused and methodical approach to each question, answering with specific and organized policy proposals, and emphasized strengths, such as his track record in stimulating the workforce.
“In the midst of the recession, my district was No. 1 in job growth,” Garcetti said.
Students who attended the debate shared different perspectives about the issues most important to them, but many agreed that Garcetti was more effective in communicating his stance overall.
“I think Councilman Garcetti won the debate — his point of view was very sharp, and he has a good perspective on job growth,” said Xiaolong Feng, a master’s student in urban planning. “To me, the issue of transportation is most important because my major is transportation  planning. Many foreign students rely on public transit, so that is also very important to us.”
Nandini Ruparel, a sophomore majoring in English, said the issue regarding public transportation also resonated most with her.
“As a USC student, the public transportation issue is really important, especially to students without cars,” Ruparel said.
The second mayoral debate will be held at the Galen Center on May 5.

On Friday, Victoria’s Secret supermodel Karolina Kurkova stepped out for a walk around her New York City neighborhood.
Wearing a short shift, comfy boots and a leather bomber, Kurkova looked like the epitome of downtown chic. Still, a supermodel walking around should not be newsworthy.
What the supermodel is wearing, however, is a different story.
On this particular day, Kurkova’s shift was covered in a print of small machine guns. In light of a failed attempt to pass comprehensive gun reform last week, this dress turned from an interesting frock to one with a whole lot of meaning.
Despite the fact that the original concept behind the design was unrelated to the U.S. legislation, the model caught a lot of flak for her attire from those who called her choice of outfit insensitive to the failed bill.
Israeli-born fashion designer Nili Lotan, who designed the dress, told the New York Daily News that the frock was conceived back in 2006 and that “it was against war and not anything to do with the personal use of guns.”
This incident might have gotten blown out of proportion, but it begs the question: When does fashion take it too far?
It’s not the first time that an outfit has offended someone. Fashion is supposed to break rules, but sometimes the collective majority can agree that some things just go a little too far.
In November, lingerie behemoth Victoria’s Secret apologized for putting an incredibly elaborate, Native American-themed headdress on leggy supermodel Karlie Kloss in their annual fashion show. Animal-print bra and underwear? Check. Belly decorations? Check. Ceremonial headdress that denotes honor to a subset of Native Americans? Let’s not do that.
Some people might think that it’s harmless fun. After all, who doesn’t dress up as Pocahontas on Halloween every once in a while?
But as Michelle Spotted Elk told the Associated Press last fall, “When you see a Lakota chief wearing a full headdress, you know he is a very honourable man. He was a leader. He did a lot of honorable things for his people. It also has religious significance. With them, there’s not a division between spirituality and their leadership.”
Boom. Statements such as that certainly have the power to stop someone in their tracks. Victoria’s Secret was just trying to have a little fun, where’s the harm in that? Unfortunately, no matter how pretty the headdress might look on a scantily clad model, mocking a religion and culture in such a manner is no joke.
Native Americans have had their land ripped away from them. They have suffered as the United States government took their land and sold it. And for all this suffering, they get to witness bad representations of ceremonial garb being modeled with Bruno Mars singing in the background.
Plus, how offended do you think Muslims would get if they saw a lingerie model walking down the runway with a hijab? Or what if she were wearing a nun’s habit?
Yet Victoria’s Secret isn’t the only store to cause some alarm. Somewhere between a Monopoly-like game called “Ghettopoly” in which you get “yo whole neighborhood addicted to crack, collect $50” and a T-shirt with what looks eerily similar to a Nazi-mandated Star of David on it, hipster brand Urban Outfitters has become the spot for easily offensive shopping.
Sure, many minority groups get up in arms over seemingly nothing. As an African-American, I sometimes roll my eyes when even the simplest of things is called racist and demeaning.
However, when someone is profiting over a game in which players pretend like they live in the ghetto — a reality for so many people — that’s when it’s appropriate to get angry. When a store is profiting from a T-shirt that alludes to the Holocaust, that’s when it’s appropriate to get angry.
Last year, designer Jeremy Scott tried to profit from a pair of sneakers he had designed for sports giant Adidas. They looked like a simple pair of sneakers at first, yet on the top were yellow shackles to strap yourself in.
In a column for The Huffington Post, Rev. Jesse Jackson said “The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution, is offensive, appalling and insensitive. Removing the chains from our ankles and placing them on our shoes is no progress.”
Fashion is many things. Fashion is fun. Fashion is crazy. Fashion is individual. But both designers and consumers have a duty to make sure that what they create is a positive reflection of the society we want to be. No one really wants to be insensitive, but if you casually wake up in the morning and throw on a gun dress while the nation reels in horror from a violent attack, you’re playing with fire.
By promoting and selling certain items, we’re helping to continue this idea that shackles are funny, that the Star of David looks so fresh in yellow, that headdresses are fun and sexy and that gun dresses are just so super cute.
Clothes are no reason to lose common courtesy. Clothes are no reason to forget about the troubles that humans face every single day.
By constantly keeping stores and designers in check, we’re helping to make sure that prejudice and insensitivity disappear a tiny bit faster.
Kurkova probably didn’t realize her mistake until it was too late (let’s blame it on the fact that she’s not from the United States) but hopefully she now understands the meaning behind her outfit.
Fashion isn’t all about fun and games. And sometimes, we all just need to grow up a bit.

Oconomowoc: If you Google it, you’ll find it is a city in Wisconsin — Waukesha County, to be exact. However, in the case of the film Oconomowoc, a comedy centered around three Wisconsin slackers, the name foreshadows the silliness of the film.

When the film opens to a half-naked man in a polka-dot bathrobe running up to the main character, Lonnie Washington (Brendan Marshall-Rashid), the absurd nature of the film is immediately confirmed.
But, though the slacker-comedy film, directed by Andy Gillies, stays true to its quirky roots, it does so to its own detriment. Despite some laughs, Oconomowoc eventually feels like just a bunch of bizarre situations thrown together with many loose ends.
After Lonnie’s friend, Travis, persuades him to join his shirt business, Lonnie finds himself in the middle of a “tense” feud with a local middle school student. During this period, he also meets a cute female pharmacist who wants to change him into a more confident and self-respecting individual.
This sets the stage for a feel-good journey, and it is a script audiences know all too well: the slacker-type man who searches to find his place in the world. Still, despite the easy-to-follow format, Oconomowoc can’t seem to find its narrative.
The film focuses so much on making its characters as outrageous as possible that it loses focus on character and plot development. Sure, each character is introduced in a humorous manner that shows off just how weird they are. But the film does not expand on them or bother to give the audience more insight into exactly why they are so weird.
Lonnie’s father lives with his mother and stepfather, yet the audience only sees him for two scenes, and do not even get to see how he would interact with the other characters. The audience does not learn why the parents are divorced, nor why Lonnie is still living in the house.
Even the flow of the film lacks fluidity. The transitions between each situation are marked by a fade to black and some quirky folk music courtesy of the filmmakers. Though the music, a mix of bluegrass and folk, does meld well with the absurdity of the film, it does not help these transitions.
Instead, because of them, the film feels segmented. Rather than working toward a cohesive conclusion, the film highlights each scenario individually and does not bother to build the scenes together to make a full feature film.
The dismal acting, particularly that of Marshall-Rashid, does not help the cause. Even when Lonnie is supposed to be surprised, sad, embarrassed or any other range of emotions, Marshall-Rashid comes across as indifferent. Because of that, several scenes proved to be quite confusing because he does  not express the emotions that the characters were commenting on.
The fact that one hears little about Lonnie does not help Marshall-Rashid’s cause. Early on, Lonnie does not take a job offer, simply because he says it was not in his best interest. That might be the case, but the audience does not learn why he would rather live with his mom broke than take that job. This is one of countless examples of a simple loose end that the film does not address.
Still, that does not mean that all of the characters were unlikeable. Travis Klitz, played by Gillies, is one of the few actors that are able to pull off his dialogue in an engaging and funny way. Sure, his character is just as absurd as every other, but his deadpan delivery makes all of the difference and Travis’ irrationality and quirkiness actually drive the majority of the plot.
Had the film not focused too much on its own weirdness, it could have had a lot of promise. Absurd comedies might be known for being random and bizarre, but the best ones still have substance underlying the comedy.
What Oconomowoc struggles to capture is the essence of each character, a misstep that estranges the viewers from the film as a whole. When every character in the town is crazy and the viewer cannot understand why, it indicates that the film lacks full development.
Unfortunately, these shortcomings overpower the comedic fun of the film and leave the viewer with a disjointed experience.

When you think of a DJ these days, the image of a ego-laden twentysomething in shades jumping to throbbing chaotic beats might come to mind.
Spinning style · French DJ Thibaut Berland, known in music circles by his stagename Breakbot, mixes upbeat sounds that are easy on the ears. Berland is most well known for his international hit “Baby I’m Yours.” – Courtesy of Marco Dos Santo
 
But Thibaut Berland, who recently wrapped up his first tour in America, has a colorful background and distinct style that separates him from many perpetuated DJ stereotypes.
Known as Breakbot to his fans, the French DJ started experimenting with music when he was six years old, but at that age, he was an artist in more ways than one.
“When I was a kid, I loved drawing,” Berland said. “I studied graphic design in college. I even started working in film.”
The covers for Berland’s EPs are testaments to his eye for design. A cartoon version of the artist wearing a regal velvet cloak graces the front of his EP Fantasy, while 1 out of 2 features a plastic-doll version of Berland, nearly identical to the DJ in real life.
Berland also played a role in the creative development of the music video to his most popular song to date, “Baby I’m Yours.” The video, composed of 2,000 hand-drawn watercolor images painted in succession, is vivid and mesmerizing.
Despite his multifaceted artistic talents, he eventually realized that his heart was in music.
“I kind of always wanted to do music. I think I was meant to do it,” Berland said.
So, it almost seemed to be fate when he crossed paths with Justice, a French electronic duo from the French music label Ed Banger Records.
“I was at the right place at the right time. Once I graduated from the graphic design school in Paris, I started making music in my apartment. One night, I heard Justice and loved what I was hearing,” Berland recalled. “They were doing some sort of new genre, a new sound, and I was really impressed so I tried it out myself. I was introduced and soon enough my first remix was released by Ed Banger.”
With support from the Ed Banger label, Breakbot was born. The name, a portmanteau of the words robot and break, represents how Berland relies upon his expansive knowledge of music and his wide range of creativity to pump out his own music — be it original or remixed tracks.
It’s no wonder then that Berland, who has an undeniable natural talent, was signed onto Ed Banger Records so quickly. Using synths that are easy on the ears, upbeat rhythms and catchy choruses, Berland infuses a certain happiness into his music that’s different from the usual head-banging riffs and potty-mouthed lyrics found in contemporary music.
Berland’s lyrics, which are sung by artists he collaborates with, are innocent and even sweet to some extent — reminiscent of days when music didn’t have such  explicit lyrics.
His influences undoubtedly contribute to his small but quality body of work. “I have many, many influences, but the main ones are Hall & Oates, Prince, Daft Punk and Justice,” Berland said.
Since Berland doesn’t do any of the singing himself, he works with other artists, which helps to make each of his songs stand out from one another.
On the record, Berland worked with three different singers. The main one is Irfane, the singer on ‘Baby I’m Yours.’
“We met through mutual friends, and there was a song called ‘Sweet Nights’ [which he sang], and I was really impressed by his voice,” Berland said. “I met him at a concert in Paris three or four years ago and I asked if he wanted to collaborate. He said yes, and we’ve been friends since.”
Berland has worked with artists from all over the world. Berland said he doesn’t necessarily have a set number of artists he wants to work with, but rather he seeks out other creative thinkers who inspire him.
“I would love to make more collaborations, mostly [with] singers. But it would certainly be wonderful to make more and more collaborations, to share music,” Berland said.
Considering that Berland draws some of his own inspiration from Los Angeles, a collaboration with an artist in the area might be in the works, someday.
“[In L.A.], we had a few days off, so we went to vintage shops, looking through records. … I love L.A. We’re thinking about living there for a few months this winter. Either around Echo Park or Hollywood,” Berland said.
Even though Berland’s fame has surged over the past year, he still conveys a certain earnest, humble quality when he talks about his own work.
“As long as they react to the music, that’s OK with me,” he said. “I don’t want anyone to be bored. As long as they feel something, that’s pretty cool.”
I love his music!

Last week, the USG Senate unanimously approved a resolution calling for more funding for the USC recreational athletics programs.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
 
USG, in passing this resolution and demanding more funding for recreational programs, has shown a profound lack of understanding about the amount of time USC students spend at the gym, compared to other daily activities.
Last Tuesday, USG Director of Wellness Wiley Strahan told the Daily Trojan that he “found that the areas in most disrepair are the places students spend most of their time, such as the Lyon Center, which is why [he has] been determined to get a resolution regarding student needs through the Senate.”
Frankly, it is hard to believe that students are spending most of their time, which would be more than 12 hours day, at the gym or playing recreational sports.
However, if USG does believe the recreational sports program needs extensive reform, then USG should recognize that the problem is too big for USG to handle and instead should be handled by the USC administration.
To begin, USG allocates only $314,000 for the programming boards that provide funding to student clubs and organizations, according to the 2013-14 budget, which will be voted on by the Senate later this week. Though USC boasts extensive extracurricular opportunities for students, the ability for student groups to receive funding is incredibly limited.
Besides a massive chunk of time lost after applying for funding, each of the more than 750 student organizations on campus can only receive funding from one of the few funding boards. Each board is limited to a low amount of funding, and student organizations can only receive funding from one of those boards. Other requirements might include that the funding be used solely for events and only after an in-depth budget report is created on behalf of the group.
One group on campus, however, has no need to search for funding. The USG budgeted more than $238,000 for itself in student stipends, according to the budget report. The money goes toward the salaries of the student USG members, from the president and the vice president to each of the 12 student senators. USG had no comment on the official salary amounts of each of the positions.
Thankfully, the stipend rate has now decreased almost 11 percent from the previous administration, according to current treasurer Kameron VanWoerkom. However, this decrease does not justify the secrecy surrounding the huge salaries USG sees fit to award its members.
Senators, who are paid about $2,500 each year, work eight hours a week, half of which are spent in the office, according to two former senators from USG. However, senators do not necessarily have to do anything during office hours. While some senators do lobby administrators, meet with their constituents and write relevant resolutions, some just show up. Part of the fault lies with students who do not put pressure on USG to be more active, but USG must push itself anyway.
On top of that, every year USG allocates a significant part of its budget to send the entire USG student group on an expensive weekend retreat where, according to the treasurer, it receives significant discounts. Although the new Kurth-Park administration has said they are looking for a less expensive venue for retreat, it certainly doesn’t make sense that USC students have to foot the bill.
It’s unfortunate that USG unanimously demanded that USC allocate more money to recreational sports programs instead of reducing its own salaries for the sake of other student extracurricular activities. The majority of students are part of smaller organizations on campus, and these students deserve just as much attention.
Last week, USG Assistant Director of Wellness Affairs A.J. Pinto spoke for USG when he said, “We’re really hoping that administrators will recognize the needs of our campus and will try harder to adequately accommodate those needs.”
Well, it’s time for the new administration to step up.
Dan Morgan-Russell is a freshman majoring in international relations global business.
CORRECTION: The original article incorrectly stated that USG’s retreat was a week long. The retreat only lasts for two days. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
At Mt. San Antonio College, I served as an officer in the Associated Students as a Senator during the 2007-08 academic year and the Chief Justice during the 2009-10 academic year.  During those years, I was not paid for my work.  While I was able to make my work schedule accommodate my meeting schedule for these two roles, many officers in the Associated Students were unable to serve in their elected roles because they could not find the time to fulfill their financial obligations.  As a result, there was a lot of intra-year turnover, and this caused turmoil in executing planned events and creating stability within Mt. SAC’s student government.  
If USC moved to a similar system–as has been suggested by many Daily Trojan staff writers over the past two years–it would prevent USG from maintaining the professionalism and transitional stability it has had over past years that enable it to execute its duties effectively.  While I know everyone hates money that seems to be spent on events like retreats for their representatives, the USG retreat is done on a budget compared to the retreats I have seen other student governments take from other universities at the Region VIII Treasurer for the SSCCC during the 2010-11 academic year. 
In fact, most other student government organizations take multiple retreats, while USC’s USG only attends one brief retreat to inform members about their responsibilities and how to work with other USG officers and USC administrators.  Moreover, the  retreat is held locally, USG representatives share beds, and transportation is not provided for students with USG funds.  Again, this is significantly more cost efficient than retreats held by other student governments at other colleges and universities.  If no retreat was held, as I have seen happen at some Community Colleges in the local area, then I would predict that USG would be much less effective in executing its responsibilities on behalf of the students at USC.  Regardless, it is important to point out that this was one of the issues that differentiated the two tickets that ran for President/VP this year, and the student body voted for the ticket that supported the retreat, so the opinion of the student body has likely been heard to an extent on this issue.  
Most importantly, for USG officers who work with administrators to voice the concerns of students and Program Board officers who try to get outstanding speakers and performers to come to campus, it is critical that we maintain professionalism and stability from year to year to maintain the reputation of our organization.  The fact that our organization is able to do this with a smaller budget than other colleges and universities I have attended is commendable.  While there can always be improvement, I suggest the staff writer responsible for this article do more research because this article neglects any attempt to compare USG’s performance relative to work done by similar organizations at other universities.

When readers sit down to read the newspaper every morning, they probably never think about the people who own it. This might change with a recent controversy surrounding the potential sale of the Los Angeles Times.
Since 2000, the L.A. Times has been the property of the media company Tribune, which owns copious news stations, newspapers, magazines and more. In the past few weeks, however, billionaires Charles and David Koch have become frontrunners in acquiring the prestigious title, according to The New York Times.
It might not seem important at first, but turning over a trusted publication to a powerful individual or individuals is likely to have negative ramifications for the L.A. Times. In an industry that has already seen a rapid decline because of the advent of social media, online blogs and Internet publications, the sale of the L.A. Times to owners such as Charles and David Koch seems unavoidable and, yet, it is a transaction that should be undertaken with extremely careful consideration.
According to the Huffington Post, the Koch brothers are considered the founders of the Tea Party. They’ve boasted a long and successful career based on their libertarian ideas and, according to The New York Times, earlier this year they held a seminar for some wealthy friends in which they proposed a 10-year strategy to shift the country toward a smaller government with less regulation and taxes.
The decision to purchase the Los Angeles Times, along with eight other regional newspaper industry, is part of that strategy.
Although personal beliefs are protected by the Constitution, the possession of a massive media platform, one that reaches millions of people on a daily basis, means it is likely that the brothers’ agenda would somehow trickle down through the pages.
According to Amy Chozick in an article for The New York Times, “The papers could serve as a broader platform for the Kochs’ laissez-faire ideas.”
Such a revelation is alarming for the newspaper industry. Though the Koch brothers, along with every other American citizen, are free to voice those opinions to the extent protected by the First Amendment, a newspaper publication like the Los Angeles Times is not something that should be subject to behind-the-scenes influence in ideology.
Seton Motley, president of the activism org Less Government and a friend of the Kochs, gave a frightening quote to the New York Times: “A running joke among conservatives as we watched the GOP establishment spend $500 million on ineffectual TV ads is ‘Why don’t you just buy NBC?’ It’s good the Kochs are talking about fighting fire with a little fire.”
The idea of handing over the Los Angeles Times — along with several other influential publications — to powerful individuals whose personal political agendas could influence the publications is a potential breach of the journalistic integrity on which most newspapers are founded.
Yet, Tribune is adamant on selling most of its publications, and individual billionaires are the only sellers capable of making the transaction. The loyal readers who have followed the Los Angeles Times for all 125 years of its existence deserve better than to see the paper turned into a fully pulpit, and should carefully follow how its sale unfolds.
Major newspapers across the country have seen cutback after cutback, with many firing veteran reporters and/ or giving reporters smaller salaries. Several large newspapers, most recently the Boston Globe, have also completely gone under.
As James Warren of The Atlantic said, “[The] younger generation wants its information online, and newspapers and magazines have obliged by, after first being too slow to embrace the Internet, giving their content away online for free.”
The industry is already in trouble. And every time a Rupert Murdoch or a Charles and David Koch snaps up a title to put under their belt, the trouble deepens. For newspapers to do their job, there needs to be as little outside influence as possible. Unobjective news isn’t news.
It’s time for the media to get back to the basics of reporting and leave personal beliefs at the door.

Wait, who decides whom can buy what? 
If it is anyone but the person with the money, it is not a free society.
In a regulated market, the government serves the function to keep fraud and violence in check. 
When a government starts deciding whom can buy what, it is setting itself up a master of slaves or father of children that never grow up.
Hmmm. No hand-wringing here about Warren Buffett (D) buying newspapers throughout the U.S. at an accelerating rate. And no concern that Chris Hughes, who handled online strategies for President Obama (D) bought and operates The New Republic magazine. Or that former U.S. Representative Jane Harman (D) took a swing and a miss at saving Newsweek magazine and retains an ownership stake in The (D)aily Beast. Is it your thesis that only (D)emocratic leaning people can be responsible proprietors of newspapers? Because if so then why is The New York Times in economic free-fall back here in New York with good union jobs vaporizing monthly at the hands of a (D)ubious management team, while Uncle Rupert – just a few blocks away – is adding staff – many of them union and confirmed (D)emocrats?
The author interjects their ideological bias and disregards opposite viewpoints. Rather than allow “free speech” whether it’s right or left treated equally, the author claims the Koch brothers are not entitled to purchasing a free enterprise because of their political stance. Once again liberal tolerance is only allowed to like minded entities and opposition minded prospectives are prohibited. Talk about a one sided hit piece.
I’ll renew my subscription and advertise my business once the Koch brothers clean out the trash that currently writes for the LA Times!
Are you oblivious to the fact that the Los Angeles Times already leans way to the left?  The paper seems to put out more hit pieces on anything/anyone that isn’t uber-liberal than it does report on news.
The minute the Koch brothers take over the Los Angeles Times I’ll be canceling my subscription.
I really hope this sale doesn’t go through for the exact same reasons you cited. Thanks for writing this; hope it reaches many students and makes them aware of how important it is.

The daughter sat and listened to the father.
This was May 2008 and Monica Vavic was in the lobby of a Northern California hotel near the Stanford University campus, the site where the USC women’s water polo team had fallen to heavily favored UCLA 6-3 in the NCAA championship game earlier that day.
Her dad, who also happened to be USC head coach Jovan Vavic, thanked his seniors for their effort after four tough, grueling seasons. For many of them, that day marked the end of their playing careers.
And so, as is customary throughout college sports, the coach said thanks as part of a tribute and farewell, wishing them all the best in their future careers, maybe in business, or in finance, or in communication.
His speech, as Monica recalls, was moving.
“When he was speaking, I just remember sitting there and realizing that there’s no one who cares about this more than he does — that I know of,” says Monica, who was 14 years old at the time.
For Monica, that was all she needed to hear. She couldn’t wait to come to USC and play for her dad, very well the nation’s premier water polo coach with 11 national championships and 11 national coach of the year awards while heading both the USC men’s and women’s teams.
She couldn’t wait, so much so that she graduated from Palos Verdes High School a year early and enrolled at USC as a wide-eyed 17-year-old in fall 2011, aiming to bring more hardware to the family’s South Bay home.
“No other school was an option,” says the 5-foot-8 driver with a flair for placing the ball in the back of the net. “USC was the place I wanted to go.”
For the Women of Troy, who have stumbled just once in 22 games this season and are ranked No. 2 in the national polls, her arrival has already paid off. Now a sophomore, Monica, 19, leads the team in scoring with 62 goals (the next closest being junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist with 34). The season before, she was a first-team All-American, the first USC true freshman to earn the honor in 13 years.
This excellence has only continued.
In her latest effort, she scored on a cross-cage shot in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter, taking part in an 11-6 win over No. 4 UCLA on Friday in the team’s regular season finale. It marked her 100th career goal, lofting her into a small group of USC players to achieve the feat by their sophomore seasons.
“She’s a very studious player,” Jovan says. “She’s not one of those people who’s going to go home and not think about it. She really prepares well. That’s her strength.”
By this point, it’s hard for even the tough-minded coach not to smile when asked about his daughter.
Jovan has watched Monica evolve into one of the premier scorers in collegiate water polo. She’s developed so rapidly that he doesn’t hesitate to suggest she could be an Olympian, possibly even as soon as the 2016 summer games in Brazil. Though of course, in usual fashion, the ever-demanding coach prefaced his declaration by saying she can only achieve this “if she commits fully to the training with the national team.”
Not to mention, on the men’s circuit, his son Nikola has helped key the Trojans to three NCAA titles over the last three seasons. The junior driver also remains a finalist for the Peter J. Cutino Award, the Heisman Trophy of water polo, after scoring a school-record 83 goals in 2012.
To say the least: Jovan’s offspring have given his programs an enormous lift, carrying that same nose-to-the-grindstone focus that’s brought quite a few wins.
When in the pool, they’re there to score. And to win.
“I think we both want the ball and we want to be in charge and to dominate,” Nikola says.
Jovan, who lined up at two-meter and driver during his playing days in the 1980s, sees those similarities, too, and the family resemblance.
“It’s interesting, because Monica is actually a similar player to me. Nikola, too,” Jovan says. “They’re both drivers and crafty. They both have my stroke, which is ugly. They’re not particularly gracious swimmers.”
Suffice it to say, they get plenty from Dad. Monica talks about how they, as children, played with Legos in front of the family television set while Jovan watched film from water polo practice.
They were immersed early, and have since stayed in. They’ve been his students for quite some time.
So perhaps, with the NCAA tournament on the horizon, Monica will become the next in the family to be fitted for a ring.
It’s why she rushed off to USC.

The No. 1-ranked USC women’s rowing team capped off another successful weekend up in Gold River, Calif., winning yet another team championship at the 2013 Lake Natoma Invitational on Sunday.
Leading the pack · The No. 1-ranked USC women’s rowing team boasts two first-place finishes in 2013 as it nears closer to the postseason. – Courtesty of Dan Avila
The Women of Troy proved victorious in the varsity eight event and finished second in both the varsity four boats and the second varsity eight.
“This was a very good regatta for us,” USC head coach Zenon Babraj told USCTrojans.com. “It was a good experience and especially difficult because it was after a couple of big wins in San Diego. We beat the No. 2 crew in the country today. We had a good Saturday and won all our races, but the main races were today when we raced Cal and Stanford in the finals.”
On the final day of races, USC was tested on the 2,000-meter course by two of the top teams in the nation, taking on No. 2-ranked California followed by No. 9-ranked Stanford.
In its first race of the day, USC’s varsity four squad, coxed by sophomore Paige Fernandes, logged in a time of 7:20:00, which was good enough for second place behind Cal’s  time of 7:16:10, 3.90 seconds faster than the Trojans.
The foursome, stroked by freshmen Kamali Houston and Darian DiCianno along with juniors Kajsa Olsson and Eglit Vosu, came in 2.20 seconds ahead of the Stanford four in order to capture that second-place spot.
“The four did a very good job. Cal didn’t race its four down in San Diego at the Crew Classic. They are ranked really high and some people think that they are the fastest four in the country,” Babraj told                    USCTrojans.com. “We did well, though, with some fight. Our four was only four seconds behind so that’s very promising.”
In the day’s closest race, USC’s second varsity eight battled Cal’s boat for the entire 2,000 meters, but sophomore starboard Elizabeth Turner and the Trojan bow ball crossed the line just 1.90 seconds after the Golden Bears (6:31:30). Both teams handedly beat the Cardinal, who came in at a time of 6:46:40.
“We had a good race, but the young boat with a freshman stroke struggled a little bit in the middle of the race,” Babraj told                                                          USCTrojans.com. “The fight lasted the entire 2,000 meters. With four weeks to go before the Pac-12 championships, there’s still some work to do, and we can field a second varsity eight that can be even more competitive.”
Determined to overcome two second-place finishes, the Trojan boat strived to come out on top in the day’s main event, the first varsity eight. Coxed by Jennah Blau and with junior All-American Vineta Moca at stroke, the USC boat trailed early to both Cal and Stanford through 500 meters, but made its move across the halfway mark to take the lead.
The Women of Troy held their water the rest of the way to capture the win in a time of 6:20:40 and remain undefeated in 2013. Cal finished 3.6 seconds slower at 6:24:00 and staved off Stanford, who came in at 6:25:90.
“This was a good experience,” Babraj told USCTrojans.com. “It’s something that gives us good information on what we need to work on and what we need to do. This was a very important race for the first eight and they gave a great performance. Everybody was prepared for them, but they were ready and came out on top. That was great for the entire team.”
In the final team standings, Cal finished second behind USC with Stanford and No. 12 Notre Dame tying for third.
USC will have a break from racing next weekend, as it prepares to take on crosstown rival UCLA in their annual dual on May 4 in Marina Del Rey, Calif.

USC head coach Dan Hubbs calls his team the “cardiac kids” because of his players’ propensity for late-inning drama.
It’s unclear exactly how close they came to actually giving him a heart attack on Sunday against Utah, but they couldn’t have been that far off.
Catching fire · USC freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson led the Trojans’ offensive attack on Sunday against Utah, going 3-for-6 with two runs scored and 5 RBI to extend his hitting streak to 12 games. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (16-23, 8-10 Pac-12) blew a 10-2 lead, allowing a game-tying single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, before scoring five runs in the tenth and taking the rubber match of the three-game series against the Utes 15-10.
“Hey, it was nice to jump out to the big lead,” said an understandably pleased Hubbs. “A lot of good happened over the weekend, and we played great on Sunday, really, except for that one inning.”
But that one inning almost did the Trojans in. USC led 8-1 after three innings and 10-2 after five, the highlight being a two-RBI triple by freshman outfielder Timmy Robinson, who was 3-for-6 and has seen his average jump 80 points in the last month and 20 this weekend alone.
Junior Bob Wheatley, the Trojans’ ace for much of the season, returned from injury after missing his last two starts. He tossed two perfect innings in a controlled outing before usual Sunday starter Kyle Twomey came on in relief. The freshman allowed a pair of runs over three pretty rough innings of work before bowing out before the sixth.
“I figured we’d have two guys go two innings each, and then we’re good to go,” Hubbs said.
If only it were that simple.
Sophomore Nigel Nootbaar allowed hits to the first three hitters he faced in the sixth, putting him in a jam with runners at second and third and a run already in. Then the USC defense made three errors on its next two plays, allowing two more runs to come in and cutting the lead to 10-5.
“We really threw and kicked the ball around,” Hubbs said. “And that obviously didn’t help [Nootbaar], especially because he wasn’t pitching well anyways.”
Freshman Brent Wheatley came in with runners at the corners and nobody out and promptly walked the first hitter he faced to load the bases. He induced a sacrifice fly out of the next hitter, but then allowed a single, a double and hit a batter before he was removed with two on, one out and seven runs in.
“It was kind of unbelievable,” Hubbs said of that sixth inning. “You’re just trying to make it stop.”
Fellow freshman Kyle Davis came in to stop the bleeding, getting a pair of strikeouts to mercifully end the inning after seven runs, five hits, three errors, a walk and a hit batsman. What was a 10-2 lead was suddenly 10-9.
Davis pitched well, sending Utah down quietly in the seventh and eighth before the Utes mounted a rally in the ninth, eventually plating the game-tying run on a bloop single with two outs.
Seemingly dead in the water, having just blown an eight-run lead and having not scored since the fifth inning, the Trojans roared back in the 10th. Robinson smacked a bases-loaded single through the left side to score a pair, giving him five RBI for the day.
Freshman left fielder Bobby Stahel followed that up with a two-RBI double and then scored on a wild pitch to put the Trojans up 15-10. Davis came back out for the bottom of the inning to seal a victory for USC.
“Hey, to put up five in the 10th after blowing an eight-run lead, that shows a lot,” Hubbs said. “I was really pleased with the way we bounced back.”
All told, USC set a season high in runs with 15 and hits with 22. It’s the first time the Trojans had 20-plus hits in a game since their 21-hit performance in May 2008 against UC Riverside.
The Sunday finale was in sharp contrast to the relatively routine games that preceded it. Utah smacked the lifeless Trojans 10-0 in the opener on Friday, the first time all year USC was shut out.
The Trojans returned the favor with a 7-4 win on Saturday that wasn’t as close as the score indicates. USC was up 7-1 headed into the ninth, but surrendered three runs in that final frame, perhaps a foreshadowing of the cardiac arrest to come the following day.
The Trojans continue their road trip with the first of a three-game series against Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore. on Friday, with the first pitch slated for 4 p.m.
