USC’s offensive line undoubtedly took a hit when tackle Austin Jackson graduated to the NFL after the 2019 season. 
It took another hit Wednesday. 
Redshirt junior offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker announced via Twitter that he will forgo any potential 2020-21 college football season to declare and prepare for the 2021 NFL Draft. 
“I am extremely blessed and thankful for the opportunity I have to be a part of a football team and earn an education that many dream about, but few get to experience,” Vera-Tucker wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. “It has been an honor to wear the Trojan uniform and represent this great University.”
Vera-Tucker was a left guard for the Trojans in 2019, earning a spot on the All-Pac-12 Second Team and AP All-Pac-12 First Team. Vera-Tucker won USC’s Offensive Lineman of the Year Award despite his teammate Jackson, who would go on to be a first round selection in the 2020 draft. 
Vera-Tucker played guard in 2018 as well — serving as a backup on the right side of the line — but he was a candidate to move to left tackle to fill the void left by Jackson in the next season.
ESPN NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay ranked Vera-Tucker as the 38th best prospect overall and the third-best offensive guard in the 2021 draft class. Draft expert Mel Kiper ranked him as the fifth best offensive guard in the 2021 class back in May. 
The 6-foot-4, 315-pound Oakland native is the second USC player to opt out of a potential spring season. Redshirt junior defensive lineman Jay Tufele announced Aug. 19 he is opting out and declaring for the draft as well. 
“Thank you to my Trojan brothers!” Vera-Tucker wrote, also expressing gratitude for his coaches, academic support staff, parents, family, fans and God. “The bond here is real … Best believe I’m going to miss this family and playing with you. There is nothing like putting on that USC uniform and running out of that tunnel at the Coli with y’all. I know that climb to greatness won’t stop for any of us.”

Last week’s USC COVID-19 testing data has seen a slight decrease in positivity rates, according to testing data released online by the University Wednesday. However, USC Student Health and local public health officials anticipate an eventual increase from Labor Day weekend, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. As of now, University Park Campus has the fastest growing rate of COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County, Van Orman said.
In the week of Aug. 30, during which nearly 2,900 coronavirus tests were conducted, a total of 100 students and two employees tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the testing data. Of the 100 student cases, 44 students tested positive through external testing distributor Color’s asymptomatic surveillance testing with a 1.8% positivity rate. The remaining 56 students tested positive through USC Student Health’s testing for individuals who are symptomatic or exposed to the virus with a 23.0% positivity rate. 
One employee tested positive in surveillance testing, and another employee tested positive through symptomatic or exposed testing.
According to Van Orman, the data from last week demonstrates a slight decrease in positivity rates from the week of Aug. 28, during which nearly 200 people tested positive. However, every other neighborhood in L.A. County has seen more significant decreases in COVID-19 rates. She and epidemiologists from the Keck School of Medicine studying community transmission within USC and beyond reached this conclusion after examining last week’s case rates.
Van Orman said that the accelerating community spread can partially be attributed to students moving to the area surrounding UPC for the fall semester. 
“Anytime you have movements of people, but just for folks to be aware of, this area of the communities around here, this is a really significant amount of community transmission happening,” Van Orman said. 
Even though there is a slight dip in positivity rates, however, Van Orman said Student Health is still “cautiously optimistic” from last week because there are still several reports of social activity off campus, where students are still getting exposed. Additionally, with Labor Day weekend now behind them, Van Orman said Student Health is anticipating an increase in positivity rates in the next few weeks.
“We, along with the county of course, are very concerned about the Labor Day weekend,” Van Orman said. “And if people [were] more socializing over the Labor Day weekend, we would see that in another two weeks, so we’re watching for that potential spike after Labor Day.”
According to Van Orman, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health shared in a briefing with higher education officials that at this rate, it is very unlikely that USC will be allowed to permit any increase in campus activity until after Thanksgiving at the earliest. UPC, which is already devoid of campus activity, will remain this way for the rest of the fall semester, Van Orman said.
“The activities are really driven by the county health orders, and of course, those are grounded in what we see as far as cases,” Van Orman said. “So I think for students that were thinking maybe we’ll have classes back this semester, … I think it’s really important that it’s looking very, very unlikely that we will have any more — any increase — in campus activity this semester.”
Looking ahead to the spring semester, Van Orman said that the University is working toward the goal of having an in-person semester. Due to the uncertainties brought about by the coronavirus pandemic and the upcoming flu season, Van Orman said the University will be requiring students who live on campus next semester to get a flu shot before they come back to L.A. following the holiday break. 
However, Van Orman said faculty and staff are still thinking about contingency plans in case conditions make an in-person semester impossible.
“Everything we’re putting in place right now would have folks coming back through this whole period, though we’re asking unfortunately, it’s a challenge for faculty as well as for folks that they always have to have a contingency,” Van Orman said. “So while we believe at this point, we’re going to be back … It’s really not driven by a USC decision, it’s going to be driven by the local public health conditions.”

Kristal Silva dreamed of attending USC since fifth grade. 
Silva tirelessly worked for her acceptance, turning down a full-tuition scholarship at UC Berkeley to attend USC. Now a senior majoring in communication, she no longer feels like her dream has come true. 
Silva said she has experienced a lack of support from the University, and as a first-generation college student, she faces problems with questioning whether or not she belongs at USC. Adding financial burdens on top of that, Silva said, demonstrates the University’s failure to help its students, only uplifting “the elite.” 
To make matters worse, USC raised tuition by 3.5% for the 2020-21 academic year. Full-time students are expected to pay $59,260 — a cost that had been set in stone prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. 
“People are dying. Families are being ruined,” Silva said. “And by [the University] increasing the amount of tuition, [they’re] not even supporting [the] students through this.” 
According to Dean of Financial Aid Thomas McWhorter, the University has a long history of meeting the demonstrated need of all eligible undergraduate students. In an email to the Daily Trojan, McWhorter wrote that two-thirds of all undergraduates receive some form of financial assistance, with approximately 45% of this year’s first-year undergraduates receiving need-based funding. Additionally, some students receive merit scholarships that can help them meet or even exceed their financial needs. 
However, despite the Financial Aid Office’s efforts to meet students’ needs, some students have long faced systemic inequalities in their access to education at USC as a result of their socioeconomic status. These glaring inequities have only become more apparent with USC’s attempts to provide financial aid amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
In order to obtain additional financial aid, students must go through the appeal process. According to McWhorter, there are two main categories of appeal. Students can appeal for a change in income or resources, or a budget appeal. While an appeal for a change in income or resources will generally be met with additional aid, it is not uncommon for students to also obtain increases in loan or work-study. Budget appeals, however, are usually funded with additional loan eligibility. The further addition of loans, Silva said, does not help students whose families make less than $80,000 annually.
“You know what we’re thinking about when we got to sign up for that loan? ‘How the hell am I going to pay this shit?’” Silva said. “That’s what we’re thinking. Am I going to be able to get a job when I graduate? Was it worth coming to this school?”
In an email sent Sept. 4 to those who forwarded the University email templates on behalf of AffordableSC, a campaign focused on demanding change toward a more accessible USC education for all, Provost Charles Zukoski wrote that the University has not cut financial aid this year. According to Zukoski, USC has instead increased its contributions to financial aid, providing $225 million in grant funding this year, compared to last year’s $215 million.
The University, Zukoski wrote, faces a potential revenue drop of $597 million this fiscal year. According to Zukoski, faculty, staff and senior administrators took pay cuts this past spring to alleviate the financial loss. 
“Despite the negative financial impact of the global pandemic, USC continues to provide an excellent education,” Zukoski wrote, “and we will continue to work toward being a more affordable institution for all of our students.” 
Staying home, with scholarship displacement
When the University announced its fall reopening efforts in early June, Ruth, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, decided to stay home in the South. Since Ruth is immunocompromised, she said that she and her parents did not think her going to Los Angeles would be the best decision.
“My parents weren’t very pleased,” said Ruth, who wished to remain anonymous to prevent potential retaliation from the Financial Aid Office. “People were saying it cost the same amount to go online as in person.” 
In an attempt to alleviate need for students who have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, McWhorter announced in a University-wide email July 14 that the Financial Aid Office will award $4,000 each semester through the Undergraduate Living-at-Home Scholarship to students who normally receive financial aid for housing but choose to remain at home because of the pandemic. 
“For most of you, it has been difficult to plan for the year ahead without knowing where you will be living in the fall,” McWhorter wrote in the July 14 email. “With COVID cases on the rise in Los Angeles, there continues to be uncertainty in our fall plans, and we realize that is a particular challenge to students receiving financial aid.”
As a result, Ruth decided to opt for the scholarship and stay home for the fall. According to Ruth, her family’s financial situation looks better on paper than in reality. For Ruth’s initial financial aid package, she said the Financial Aid Office expected for her to pay around $60,000 per year — in other words, for every $3 her family makes, they give $2 to USC, Ruth said. 
Ruth’s family filed an appeal to the Financial Aid Office, which later tripled what Ruth originally received with the University Grant — grant funds that may be used for educational expenses like tuition and housing, according to the USC Financial Aid website. On top of her University Grant, Ruth had initially planned to do federal work-study and take out loans. 
After Ruth’s appeal was approved, the Financial Aid Office expected a payment of around $38,000. However, once she received her scholarship, Ruth said the Financial Aid Office reduced her University Grant by $11,000 and rejected her work-study. 
“I see it as they’re literally just shuffling — they’re just renaming my University Grant,” Ruth said. “I’m more understanding about [taking away work study], I’m not understanding the [grant] money [reduction], especially when my dad had called the Financial Aid Office, and maybe he interpreted it wrong, but it was the understanding that we wouldn’t get billed for housing and that my aid wouldn’t change, when that was not the case.”
Ruth was dealing with scholarship displacement, which prevents students from receiving the full value of the scholarships they had earned. Multiple students have confirmed to the Daily Trojan that they received less than $4,000 for the semester, with some students noting that their scholarships were repurposed from their work-study. Following McWhorter’s July 14 email, the University and the Financial Aid Office quietly corrected their language to say that students staying home would receive up to $4,000 this semester, rather than guaranteeing the full amount. 
Ruth called the Financial Aid Office mid-July and was told that students should not be paying less than what they would be paying if they were having an in-person semester.
“They basically said [students] must be reading or interpreting it wrong, which doesn’t sound accurate to me because it’s just numbers,” Ruth said. “I think you would know if you’re paying $4,000 less this semester than before.”
The Financial Aid Office told Ruth that the overall price of an in-person semester is higher, so students are given more aid to cover additional costs like housing and dining. But in a virtual semester, these costs are not taken into consideration; therefore, the overall price is lower. For some students like Ruth who are staying home, however, the Financial Aid Office has reduced their aid in order to get the students to pay the same amount regardless, Ruth said. 
According to McWhorter, the Undergraduate Living-at-Home Scholarship is a need-based grant intended to provide additional gift aid to students. However, federal regulations, which require USC to establish a reasonable cost of attendance for students (whether they reside on or off campus or live at home with relatives), limit the amount of total aid that can be provided.
“We are not allowed to provide aid over the Cost of Attendance and cannot provide gift aid in excess of federal need without jeopardizing a student’s federal and state funding,” McWhorter wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
According to McWhorter, the Financial Aid Office is aware of student concerns over securing work-study. However, due to federal regulations, McWhorter wrote that when the Financial Aid Office makes package adjustments to include the scholarship, they have to first remove or reduce federal work-study, followed by changes to unsubsidized direct loans and then subsidized direct loans. 
Not all students who are receiving the scholarship have their awarded loans and/or work study reduced, McWhorter wrote. This depends on the student’s need and the financial aid they were previously offered. For a small number of students, McWhorter wrote that their gift aid already matches their federal need; for example, a student could receive multiple additional scholarships, outside of the Living-at-Home Scholarship, that replaced their loans. In those cases, they are not able to receive the Living-at-Home Scholarship if they choose to stay home. 
Ruth filed an appeal to the Financial Aid Office twice. When she made a second appeal, Ruth noted that her family’s business suffered significant losses due to the pandemic.
“We appealed again, saying sales were down, loans are doubling in medical expenses,” Ruth said. “And then I got rejected.”
According to McWhorter, the Financial Aid Office has seen approximately a 50% increase in family contribution appeals because of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. By early August, it had reviewed nearly 2,000 appeals, with 40% approved. The office also reviewed additional documentation and special circumstances for another 1,000 students to make any possible adjustments prior to releasing their initial financial aid summaries. 
At the end of July, after her second appeal, Ruth found that the Financial Aid Office granted her family a Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan, which is granted to families who are looking for long-term financing, according to the Financial Aid website. The loan covered more than what she would have needed to pay for this semester, with her family getting around $5,000 back for the fall.
With her financial aid package now adjusted, Ruth said that she does appreciate the way the University handled its coronavirus response with forgoing the reopening; however, she does not think that USC deserved some of the positive news it received following the announcement of the scholarship. 
“When you think of scholarship, you think it’s going to make what you pay less,” Ruth said. “I think that’s the general definition, and what everyone would expect. And so, sure, they did offer that, but it doesn’t actually help with what you pay.”
For a more affordable, accessible USC
In response to the University’s refusal to reverse the 3.5% tuition hike — a decision made before the coronavirus pandemic forced the majority of the school’s activities and courses online — students grew frustrated with the University for charging more money for an entirely different experience. 
Some filed lawsuits, others created petitions. Incoming students have tried to voice their concerns with USC administrators as well after the latter refused deferrals to a later semester, but as incoming spring admit Nam Nguyen argues, the transfer student situation is one of the most complex issues to contend with at the moment even as he waits another semester to enroll. 
“The administration and their announcements [don’t] give me great confidence of what’s going on — I really wish they would just make a decision and stand by it,” Nguyen said. “That’s made me feel a bit uneasy about what’s going to happen in the coming months at the end of the fall semester when they start announcing things for spring semester that will affect me.”
Over two months ago, Nguyen created a Change.org petition that argues that with the pandemic disproportionately affecting students from low-income and marginalized communities, it would be prudent for the University to expand the Affordability Initiative, which currently grants free tuition to all incoming students starting Fall 2020 whose family’s annual income is under $80,000. In the petition, Nguyen asks for the University to extend eligibility for free tuition to current and incoming transfer students. The petition has amassed almost 1,700 signatures at the time of publication. 
Other students connected with peers over a group chat and discussed their individual expected family contributions compared to prior semesters or the lack of communication from the Financial Aid Office regarding their package. With many experiences following a similar theme, members of the group chat decided to work together to create a unified and comprehensive list of demands for the Office to address.
With a horizontal leadership model that sees representation of students from organizations across campus and in different stages of their academic career, AffordableSC was created to model the movement to demand transparency from universities that has been spreading across the country.
Students in AffordableSC are involved in a variety of roles beyond organizing, whether that be helping with the design of their Instagram statements, writing letters and email templates to the University or researching trends on the financial aid students receive and the rise in tuition over time. 
A noticeable part of their activism model, an extension of their emphasis on horizontal leadership, are several posts showing solidarity with other student groups that have pushed the University and student body to address issues such as anti-Black racism, resources for undocumented students and institutional support for USC staff. 
Connecting with these campus organizations has been one of the most productive experiences in navigating how to structure demands, AffordableSC said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. It has also been a forum to share resources related to mental health and those which benefit Black and Indigenous students and students of color. 
The group requested the interview be attributed to the organization as a whole rather than a single interviewee as a testament to the multilateral configuration of its action plan.
“We are in solidarity with all of these other movements because we know USC has the resources, and for them to use diversity and low-income students as a selling point for the University but not properly giving support … it’s just ironic to us,” AffordableSC said. 
The makeup of the group reflects the wealth and racial disparity at the University, but also the array of voices that have been left to the wayside on issues of financial security and representation. With AffordableSC’s structure and leadership including Black students, Muslim students, first-generation students, undocumented students, transfers and students from the South Central area, the group is largely made up of students of color. 
“Our demands are always evolving,” AffordableSC said. “And so we just want to … get our demands representing the low-income community as best as it can.”
Nguyen praised the group’s efforts and updated his petition last month to draw attention to and lead people to support its demands. 
“I think AffordableSC has the most comprehensive demand list that really calls out USC for a lot of inequity in its financial aid practices that’s made USC inaccessible to lower income, Black, Indigenous, people of color,” Nguyen said. “When I made that update I wanted them to know, like everyone that signed that petition, to go and support their petition instead of signing mine at this point because they have more comprehensive, better understanding of some of the shortfalls, the shortcomings of USC financial aid practices.”
Since its first post on Instagram July 12 elucidating the group’s mission statement to serve first-generation low-income students and to illustrate its solidarity with the @black_at_usc page, AffordableSC sends its almost 1,000 followers breakdowns of the group’s demands in addition to updates regarding housing, an explanation of a student’s EFC and calls to action. 
The support and visibility the page has amassed came with no shortage of sacrifice. While trying to organize as fast but as meaningfully as they could, members attended a multitude of meetings — many of which took place after classes, jobs and other responsibilities — to unify their sentiments. 
“I think this consumed my life,” AffordableSC said. “This is all that I work on. I have my job during the daytime but I know everybody dedicated a lot of their evening times and honestly some of their, what time period … is it the dawn? Like 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. just trying to get everything polished.”
Stylized similarly to the Financial Aid document portal, AffordableSC laid out its demands July 13 in three categories: an expansion and increase in financial aid, a decrease in tuition and  more accommodations for low-income students. 
Some of the action items are policy changes that would completely transform the way the Financial Aid Office calculates, disburses and continues aid packages, including removing home value and equity from the equation, meeting 100% of a student’s demonstrated need entirely through gift aid, providing new emergency grants for low-income students to last an entire academic year and consistently gifting aid granted through the entirety of a student’s time at USC. 
AffordableSC wants the University to stymie the steady growth of tuition by capping future increases at 1.5% and applying them exclusively to incoming classes while current students’ rates remain the same. Following much criticism and speculation over the quality and value of classes in an online format, AffordableSC also urges for a reversal of the tuition increase for the 2020-21 year and a 35% reduction in the same year’s sum because of the pandemic.
The group’s items aren’t just about dollars and cents. In addition, it lays out a plan for a new resource center and allocation of community guides related to Medi-Cal and Cal-Fresh that the Financial Aid Office should deliver to bolster institutional support for low-income students. And to combat the sometimes daunting process of applying for financial aid, the group sees fit that transparent communication and the assignment of a one-to-one ratio of financial aid officers (who have completed sensitivity training) to low-income students can provide guidance and promote cooperation. 
On Sept. 7, AffordableSC expressed its disappointment in Zukoski’s responses to its demands in his Sept. 4 email. AffordableSC wrote in a letter that Zukoski dismissed its concerns and “invalidated the lived circumstances of low-income students.” 
While Zukoski wrote in his email that over $30 million has been committed to the Affordability Initiative, AffordableSC wrote in its letter that USC has failed to provide any reasoning behind why the initiative cannot be expanded to all students. 
Even though need-based grants have increased by 38% in the last five years, according to Zukoski, AffordableSC noted that figure does not mean that aid covers student needs in full. 
“If need-based grants have increased by 38%, we wonder why we have many students among us who have seen decreases in their gift aid throughout their time at USC despite no changes to family income,” AffordableSC wrote in its letter.
AffordableSC wrote that it expects USC to provide a more “transparent and action-oriented” response to its concerns regarding the University’s treatment of low-income students. Moving forward, AffordableSC wrote that USC should stop reiterating facts about financial aid it already knows and instead listen to its concerns. 
“If the resources provided were as sufficient as USC claims, we would not be writing these letters or committing hours of research to put forth genuine concerns burdening the low-income community,” AffordableSC wrote. 
AffordableSC acknowledges that its demands will change based on the needs of students, and one update coordinated with IDEAS at USC to better support undocumented students July 28 reflects that adaptability. The structure of the organization is also flexible  to prevent the possibility of the administration dragging out solutions. 
“We definitely want to keep up longevity so we do have a few freshmen in AffordableSC helping out. That’s how we can have that momentum, to keep recruiting anybody from newer classes, so that this doesn’t die out,” AffordableSC said. “That’s been an issue with a lot of other [organizations] and we hope that it does not happen — AffordableSC is definitely based in both — like, obviously there’s immediate and long-term demands that we have on that list.”

The day I downloaded Tik Tok, a little part of my soul died. For as long as I could remember, I had been the person making fun of my friends for having Tik Tok, but two weeks into quarantine, my pride gave into boredom, and I watched the little circle fill up as the app loaded onto my phone. I clicked on the blue and red faded music note. Videos flooded my phone as I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled. Seasons changed outside my window. Pages flew off the calendar. 
When I finally emerged from my Tik Tok spiral, my mind felt numb. I couldn’t remember a single video I had just watched. Everything was a blur of catchy songs and wild effects. It only got worse from there. Pretty much every day for the next month, I opened Tik Tok when I was feeling bored or lonely or overwhelmed and ended up wasting hours scrolling through countless videos. I felt subdued, but none of my stress was resolved. 
When quarantine started, a lot of us lost the things that used to make us happy. Those first couple of weeks were a difficult adjustment. We were trapped in our houses with pretty much nothing to do but to binge-watch television, and the fact that we couldn’t see our friends didn’t help. Many people felt bored and frustrated and helpless. I know I did. 
As we embark on a new semester of Zoom University, we’re confronted with many of these same feelings. We’re forced to stay inside and stare at our computers all day long, and breakout rooms just don’t feel the same as in-person conversations used to. 
Art therapy is a form of therapy that allows you to alleviate stress by making art. Usually, it means painting or creating other visual art forms, but it can be whatever you want it to be. Maybe for you it’s playing your guitar or writing angsty poetry or learning pottery. For me, it was making Tik Toks. 
OK, so maybe you don’t think of Tik Toks as art, but making them is definitely therapeutic. Something about the process was really soothing for me. First, I would figure out what I wanted the video to be. Then I would find a song, an outfit to wear and start filming. Afterwards, I would edit and post. That was the best part about Tik Tok — I could go all the way through with something without losing my mind. At a time when I barely had the motivation to get through a movie, the satisfaction of making something, from start to end, was everything.  
I’m not saying you have to go viral to be happy. You could make Tik Toks venting about your feelings or doing your makeup or parodying someone famous or even make your page entirely dedicated to zooming in on and editing random images until they look like the flag of Poland (as about 50 users do). The point is, it doesn’t really matter how you choose to express yourself as long as you are expressing yourself. You don’t even have to publish your Tik Toks. Just making them is therapeutic in itself, and it’s actually a lot of fun. You might just find that sharing how you feel with other people will make you feel a lot less alone.  
Aside from being entertaining, Tik Tok is also extremely accessible. Other kinds of art therapy, such as painting or playing an instrument, require training and expensive supplies. To make a Tik Tok, you don’t have to buy a camera or expensive equipment. In fact, the most popular Tik Toks are often grainy and unprofessional. All you really need is your phone and your imagination. 
This semester is going to be hard. There’s no doubt about it. Zoom takes all the fun parts out of classes and leaves us with the hard part. You’re going to feel overwhelmed and lonely sometimes, and that’s OK you just have to find an outlet for all of that angst. And listen, it might not be Tik Tok. All I’m saying is it doesn’t hurt to try.

Acclaimed Italian novelist Elena Ferrante’s latest release is “The Lying Life of Adults,” which, like Ferrante’s earlier works, explores Neapolitan life. With a Netflix TV adaptation already in the works, the novel was named by the New York Times Book Review as one of the “Most Anticipated Books of 2020” after its initial English-language release was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
In “The Lying Life of Adults,” Ferrante chronicles the coming-of-age story of a young girl named Giovanna. The novel begins when a 12-year-old Giovanna overhears her father tell her mother that their daughter may turn out to be “ugly” like her aunt, Vittoria. This critical moment instigates her personal quest to meet with Vittoria to figure out whether she is as similar to Vittoria as she is told. In her journey to discover herself, Giovanna’s fixation on beauty reflects her own psychological state of adolescence. 
Ferrante renders teenage insecurities with skill and unflinching honesty, as Giovanna’s obsessive fear of “ugliness” and gradual distrust of her parents influences much of her actions throughout the novel. Emotion is a crucial aspect of Ferrante’s writing; “The Lying Life of Adults” is not so much structured around the adults’ lies, but Giovanna’s passionate responses to them that often manifest in her own lies. 
In her initial visits with Aunt Vittoria, Giovanna is exposed to a kind of mirror image of herself. Within these conversations surrounding the complexity of pleasure, Vittoria embodies the possibilities of sexuality and liberation. Throughout Giovanna’s childhood, Vittoria acts as more than a plot device in the novel. 
At one point, Giovanna describes Vittoria’s projection of her identity: “[Vittoria] had unloaded on me all of herself, her hatreds, her need for revenge, her language.” 
Vittoria serves as an implicit model in Giovanna’s girlhood and inevitably shapes her conception of adulthood. The emotional weight of this depiction is a testament to the richness of Ferrante’s characters. 
The lives of the adults in Giovanna’s life parallel the exploration of her own identity. When Giovanna witnesses her parents lying about their marital conflicts and when her father tells her that she is becoming more like her aunt Vittoria, Ferrante identifies Giovanna’s resentful rebellion and simultaneous conformity. These lives, and the lies that shape them, are punctuated by moments of sensitivity in Giovanna’s life where she navigates her own desires and identity in the context of her relationships. 
While vibrant in detail, “The Lying Life of Adults” often relies too much on overt self-reflection that feels repetitive. Dwelling on Giovanna’s internal thoughts does emphasize the subjective nature of truth within the novel, but, arguably, Ferrante takes this a step too far with this form of narration. At times, the reader may find it difficult to situate where exactly Giovanna is and how much time has passed since the last moment described. In these ways, the story becomes more difficult to follow, with the voice becoming the dominant point. 
In terms of her storytelling technique, Ferrante is stunningly self-reflexive. Giovanna condemns the lies of the adults around her while fabricating lies within her own life. Her perspective implies an ambiguity that never clearly delineates the boundary between falsehood and truth, which alludes to the very “fiction” of the novel. In doing so, “The Lying Life of Adults” also sets forth a claim that truth is inherently subjective. As a form of fiction, the lies we choose to tell can express more about an individual than the truths we carry.
“The Lying Life of Adults” tells us that, as teenagers, we unconsciously mold ourselves in the image of the lives we encounter. Throughout our childhood, we reject the adults that live those lives. Yet ultimately, it is in their images that we grow.

Asian Americans have characterized the Pacific Coast food culture all the way back to the California Gold Rush when immigrants planted the United States’ first domestic rice crops. From home to restaurants, the cuisine has seen a rise in popularity, becoming mainstream outside of the Asian American community. More people are familiarizing themselves with the staples: dumplings, seaweed, curry, dashi, ube. Yet, the U.S. food industry’s gold standard has remained purely Western, praising French cuisine and leaving its Eastern counterparts far from fine dining. Chefs Cecilia Leung, Isa Fabro, Sonoko Sakai and journalist Jean Trinh are changing this paradigm with unique approaches. Read more about the recent panelists and moderator in Vision & Voices’ Sweet and Salty: A Conversation With Asian American Women Chefs as they speak about their journeys and relationships with Asian American cuisine.
Isa Fabro: Chef Consultant & CEO of IsaMADE
Isa Fabro’s work extends far beyond her Filipino-inspired pastries. Her company IsaMADE is a collection of projects that include everything from her famous pop-ups at local restaurants to her philanthropic endeavors. Since she traveled to the Philippines in 2016, Fabro has been at the forefront of the Filipino food movement, creating her own dishes at the culinary incubator Unit 120, which allows chefs to experiment with their cooking free from the financial constraints of opening a restaurant.
“I was just making [Filipino] food and then I realized, wow, this is actually kind of important,” Fabro said. “People are saying that the foods I’m creating are making them feel proud.” 
Yet despite not always cooking the food of her heritage professionally, Fabro is proud of the art. For Fabro, cooking Filipino food has been a way to directly connect with her culture, an alternative from “book learning” as she calls it. 
Her desserts combine classical pastry technique with a Filipino twist. Whether it’s in the ingredients or flavors, her heritage shines proudly in her dishes.
When talking about her inspiration behind her signature Mango Royale, she said, “The Mango Royale [is] like having a mango in the Philippines in peak season. You know, ‘how do you capture that experience?’ You know, make a dessert where it really does the fruit justice.”
Jean Trinh: Award-Winning Food and Culture Journalist
As a freelance journalist, Jean Trinh writes about cuisine, history and culture. Her articles include the evolution of Thai cuisine, hybrid pastrami and the importance of tang yuan during the Lunar New Year. The one thing these works have in common? Trinh shares the stories behind the inspiration of each dish, beyond the formulaic cooking methods and ingredients.
“Back in the day, when you wrote about any other food from another culture that people didn’t regularly know, we would have to italicize it then explain what it was,” Trinh said. “And I think it’s moving, now, towards not having title-asides. Like, not everyone’s doing that anymore. And I love that.” 
Despite current increases in representation in food journalism, Trinh suggests there are still more ways the industry can improve.
“It’s a much deeper issue where you have to do mentorship of people of color, or different genders and actually give people opportunities and not just pigeonhole people,” Trinh said. “[Not] like if I’m Asian, I only write about Asian foods. Give people the opportunity to write about other things; don’t tokenize them. It’s changing the way you think about it.” 
Cecilia Leung: Chef Consultant & Former Executive Chef at Little Flower Candy Co. and Lincoln Restaurant
Despite growing up with her family’s restaurant, Cecilia Leung was discouraged by her father from pursuing the culinary arts. Through fierce determination, she watched the restaurant’s chefs and learned how to cook and bake. Leung’s passion powered her motivation and her work ethic. 
“Sometimes I really run on that adrenaline rush of hearing the tickets being printed and just moving those tickets down the rail and pushing the food through,” Leung said. “I mean that it just gets me really pumped up, and seeing what is accomplished at the end of service is amazing.”
In the food industry where more than 75% of chefs are male, Leung said, becoming the executive chef at both Little Flower Cafe and Lincoln, located in Pasadena. Her inclusive philosophy sets a positive atmosphere in her kitchen.
“When I hire cooks, regardless of what their gender is, I have to also set that tone for my staff,” Leung said. “It doesn’t matter who this person is, you have to treat them like you’re their teammate.”
Sonoko Sakai: Culinary Instructor & Cookbook Author
As a child growing up in Japan, Sonoko Sakai was surrounded by artisans, from her mom and grandmother cooking family meals to the chefs she saw through the shop windows on her walk home from school. For her, food emphasized freshness and care. 
When reminiscing about the pickled plums, umeboshi, her grandmother taught her how to make, she said, “I’m making [umeboshi] here every season in May, and I’m just getting the finished product. But they’re not the same plums, because the trees are different, the climate’s different, the environment that you’re in is different, but you still have the memories and those memories are so precious.” 
As an instructor, her classes and books echo this approach to cuisine, emphasizing the stories behind her recipes. Ever since her return to Japan in 2009, Sakai has published “Japanese Home Cooking” along with two other cookbooks to teach people the fundamentals of the cuisine, starting with the basics. Amid the pandemic, though in-person classes have come to a halt, Sakai is offering online courses, making Japanese cooking more accessible to a diverse audience.

This past summer, USC’s Undergraduate Student Government faced severe scrutiny after allegations of microaggressions and racial misconduct surfaced concerning several USG leaders. In the end, not only did former President Truman Fritz and former Vice President Rose Ritch resign, but the entire executive cabinet agreed to step down to pave the way for better representation in USG leadership. 
Today, USG is in rebuilding mode with a new president and vice president, senior Gabe Savage and junior Trinity Moore, respectively. The executive cabinet has also begun its rehiring process to find students to fill the cabinet positions. While this may seem to be nothing more than a roster change for the organization, this step has the potential to revitalize USG’s position on campus by strengthening its core mission: to redefine the student experience. 
USG, with a staff of 140 students and a budget of $2.4 million, has been behind many notable initiatives including fall break, fryft, and the First Generation Plus Center to name a few. These and other projects are made possible by USG’s three branches interacting with one another. However, the general direction and focus of the organization are dependent on the elected senators, president and vice president. These elected positions legitimize the organization’s commitment to the student body by having required office hours and meetings with students to find initiatives to lead. Their roles, in essence, are there to understand student interest to then decide what USG dedicates time and resources to. 
Senators align themselves with standing committees, which are bodies of students dedicated to one specific kind of impact. The legislative branch is where having a diverse set of perspectives becomes a true asset as this is the branch that dictates the impact of USG. This is why it is integral that the perspectives taken into consideration by this body are fully representative of this campus. The system that governs USG acknowledges that, and that is why the positions of senators, president and vice president are elected positions. The integrity of the branch itself depends on those who participate in the voting process for these positions. Without a proper voter turn out, these positions can’t gather the full extent of the student experiences that are possible here. As in any democracy, voting is a sacred right that is essential to the process and success of it. 
Voting for USG is typically done via a digital device. For a week in February, Trousdale Parkway is covered in campaign signs with campaign members running around trying to catch those who regrettably chose to walk. The frenzy continues 24/7, all in the hopes of every stopped individual pitching a ballot toward the USG election. However, the 2020-21 USG election saw a voter turnout of around 23%. This trend is not novel, with the 2019 and 2018 elections also having low voter turnout. This is a clear example of the fact that USG is not known on campus. Nearly 75% of students did not vote for USG elections, which means 75% of students were unable to individually consider and vet the students who were running for paid positions to represent them. When such a large group of students plays a blind eye, we run the chance of having a representative who is not at all who we need in power. 
As in any government, citizen participation is the only way to align systems with those impacted: It holds not only people but also the organization itself accountable to its mission. When only a quarter of the student body participates in elections, USG loses a critical opportunity to gain insight into who our student body actually is. That loss of perspective makes the organization more prone to glossing over critical issues and losing the ability to recognize systemic issues. When that happens, students get left behind and their experiences suddenly are not recognized. That is the opposite of what should happen when there is a form of government. If USG had a much higher voter turnout, that could have resulted in a larger pool of candidates as well. The benefits of having more voter turnout continue. 
While voter turnout is one sure way to increase the visibility of who our candidates are, the recent events surrounding USG point to a clear need for genuine conversations about race and representation. Whether that is on the macro-level of an organization or at the micro on friendships, conversations need to broaden people’s minds around the reality of systemic issues. Education like this includes pointing at systems we have come to rely on, acknowledging inequities in bodies of authority and educating students on microaggressions. The approach to point to problems should be done with purpose. These conversations should be recognized as a valuable insight instead of being written off as a personal opinion. 
The way these kinds of conversations are dealt with and approached dictates the organization’s culture. Consulting firm Bain & Company has published several works on the culture within organizations in relation to their operational success. According to Bain, “Companies that create a winning culture are 3.7 times more likely to be top performers.” Success in the context of USG is a measurable impact. Having that impact is only possible if the organization has more students voting and more students talking. People finding pride in the organization enough to debate and exchange ideas about it pushes everyone forward as long as we can account that we have everyone. USG is having one of those moments of accountability right now. 
Inciting organizational change is no easy task. But it is essential for organizations to have periods of reflection and dissection if they want to hold a reputable place in the future. USG certainly has a long way to go — however, there is a clear commitment to embarking on that journey.

Thanks to the work of various athletes and the Black Lives Matter movement, many sports industries are reflecting on their deep-rooted racism. The esports community should follow suit.
It does not take an expert to realize that racism in esports is rampant. Perhaps one of the most infamous cases was that of Terrence ‘TerrenceM’ Miller.
Miller is a Black professional player who focuses mostly on card games. In 2016, he participated in the DreamHack Austin Hearthstone tournament and reached the finals, which was live-streamed on Twitch. He played well, finishing in second place. However, as soon as the match ended, he was bombarded with racial slurs in the chat. The spam was so overwhelming that Twitch had to come up with a brand new strategy to combat these instances, but the damage was already done.
Maybe we are missing some important nuance. While there are common problems that are widespread in the gaming community, reducing the entire industry to its lowest denominators of racism is not fair treatment. One particular section stands out in gaming’s inclusion potential. Of course, I am talking about the fighting game community.
There are many reasons why the FGC is the exception to the rule when it comes to racial diversity. FGC maintains accessibility, adapts the “face-to-face” aspect of mass participation in tournaments and doesn’t shy away from political statements from its players. 
This last factor is increasingly clear to bystanders, especially with the rise of star player Dominique ‘SonicFox’ McLean. A gay, Black and furry player, McLean has been making headlines for their unapologetic dedication to their political beliefs and for their incredible fighting games ability. 
Their honesty and openness, paired with their master skill, guaranteed them the “Best Esports Player” award at the 2018 Game Awards. But it does not require a celebrity the size of SonicFox to realize the diversity present in the FGC. The tournament roster and content creator demographics, which top all other communities for esport pros of color, show it better than any article possibly could. 
However, even with the praise it has received, the FGC still faces one blatant issue that jeopardizes its survival: the relative lack of sponsorships. 
This issue translates into very tangible consequences, mainly the small amount of prize money in tournaments. For example, one of the most popular championships in the FGC is called “EVO,” and it has various manifestations based on which game people are playing. “EVO 2016” for “Street Fighter V” had the largest prize pool out of any EVO tournament to date, raking in just more than $100,000. While this may seem large, it pales in comparison to the last six “The International” DOTA 2 tournaments, all of which had a prize pool larger than $10 million. Pair this with the fact that many FGC athletes are not in a team, and it’s clear how hard it is to make a living as a professional fighting game player. 
All this leads us to one possible conclusion: If the esports industry truly wants to tackle its racism issues, it should support the FGC. 
Companies should begin sponsoring large-scale events such as “EVO.” While this may seem like a “top-down” approach that is doomed to fail, it fits the current context perfectly. 
The FGC already has solid foundations when it comes to racial diversity. In this scenario, more companies sponsoring events will lead to an increase in prize money. This increase means more people joining the scene, as well as maintaining the professionals already there. With the spotlight on the FGC, the standards for inclusivity would go up, especially if that is how companies decide which tournaments to sponsor. This pressure means that the FGC would have to maintain its diversity or risk losing the support it has gained. 
This suggestion does not translate into a permanent solution for racism within the gaming community. But it is a step toward a better, more diverse industry. Ultimately, video games are supposed to be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. If the professional side of it does not reflect that, then the industry is heading in the wrong direction.

Sports editor David Ramirez spoke to USC wide receivers coach Keary Colbert about his approach to recruiting, game planning and mentoring USC’s talented crop of pass-catchers. Colbert himself was a standout receiver at USC before being selected in the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft.
David Ramirez: What do you think is the biggest difference between college football now and when you were playing?
Keary Colbert: It’s a great question. I think the social media piece. It is a lot different, obviously. Especially with the name, image and likeness coming about in college football. I think college kids now have a larger platform to stand on. Their faces are out there a lot more. I mean, you don’t have to be the star player on the team to have a following or a fan base. I think that’s a big difference in college football today. 
I think recruiting is different. Partly because of social media, the ability to have access to a lot of different recruits for coaches. It makes it a lot easier to be seen and to be noticed if you’re a high school kid. Back in the day, if you wanted to be recruited, you’re sending out VHS tapes and coaches had to physically come and see you play — they’re not just sending an email or a text message with a Hudl link and stuff like that. So that makes recruiting kind of go a little more nationally in my opinion. 
From the game standpoint, I think it’s a lot more spread out as far as style of play, whereas in the past it was a little bit more smashmouth football — downhill run, play action, stuff like that. Now, of course, there are teams that still do that and there’s still situations where you see that in games, but I think the ability to kind of play in space and make defenses defend every blade of grass that there is, I think that’s a big difference in today’s game.
DR: I’m curious as to what approach you take when it comes to a game week. Are you the type of person that’s always trying to improve, always trying to make changes and little tweaks up until the very last moment or do you have a certain time where you’re like, “I’m just going to set it and forget it?” 
KC: Yeah, for me personally, I like to leave it. I like to get to a point of the game or the week where I just leave the player, leave the receivers alone and just let them play. At the end of the day, we do a lot of heavier preparation earlier in the week and then it kind of tails back. We scale it down a little bit, we refine it and then at the end of the day we recruit our guys because they’re talented football players and I don’t like to “over-coach.” Personally, I like to just give them the freedom to go out there and be who they are naturally and just trust that all that we’ve done in the week of preparation will be enough. 
Of course, on game day and during the game, I’m their set of eyes. We have other coaches that are their sets of eyes that can help them see things, process things, give answers to the test while we’re out there. So I don’t really like to take up too much of a player’s time because I didn’t really like that as a player. You know, I like to kind of prepare my own way, especially the day of a game or night before a game and stuff like that. Everybody has their own process now — of course, there’s guys that have questions and want to meet. We make that time available for them. I’m saying I’ll do whatever I have to to help somebody be as prepared as possible for a game. But for me, I like to just kind of cut them loose, man, trust the process and let them go play.
DR: As a fan it’s very easy to say “start this guy” and “bench this guy” because you don’t know them as human beings. You deal with these people on a daily basis, you know them much greater than what they are as athletes. How do you handle that weight knowing you’re dealing with people’s livelihoods? You’re making decisions, but at the same time it’s affecting people very deeply.
KC: Yeah, that’s probably the toughest part about coaching. Everybody works really hard during the week and everybody puts in a lot of time and effort into this game and the sport and the team. But not everybody’s results are the same.
At the end of the day, it is our duty as coaches to do what’s best and right for the team and hard decisions have to be made. The best players play. Sometimes it’s not that other players are not good players. It’s just that there might be a slightly better player in front of you at the time, but as long as guys trust the process, you just never know what happens. I mean, I’ve seen it.
DR: Do you have a game day superstition? Anything that you have to do on a game day before a game?
KC: When I walk up the tunnel at home games, I always touch all the wide receivers that are on the wall inside when you go through the tunnel. There’s pictures of all the great players, I touch all the wide receivers and then also touch my roommates Carson and Troy and some of the guys that I’ve played with that I’m really close to. It’s something that I’ve been doing since I played at USC. It’s something that continues all the way up until now every time I walk in the Coliseum.
DR: How do you feel about the group that you have right now?
KC: Honestly, I’m really sad about the season being postponed. I’m saying that because this is literally the best collection of wide receivers that I’ve ever been associated with — and I’m talking about from a playing standpoint to a coaching standpoint. I’m talking about top to bottom. I’ve been around some great wide receivers. As a group — from one to nine or one to however many is in the room — as a collection, this is one of the best groups that I’ve been a part of. 
I just hate that they’ve been working so hard; I hate that they don’t get to go out and show it. I mean, obviously, it was a good group last year, and I really think that we were in the process of taking another step up. 
That’s what I say about the group: They work really hard. They push each other, which is probably the best thing because when you have good players, the bar keeps rising. You can have good players that just kind of do their thing and you have other players down at the bottom, but when good players push one another and bring another person out of them, it raises the bar in the room. I’ll tell you, man, they’re special. I haven’t been around a collection of wide receivers like them.
DR: There’s a lot going on right now — public health, social justice, a lot of different things. If there’s anything going into this that you wanted to make sure you got off your chest, you want to make sure you had heard, I just wanted to give you that chance.
KC: I just spoke about my frustration, our frustration as a group, our frustration as a team. I think it’s important to understand that there are bigger issues going on bigger than ourselves.
We have to find a way to be better individually and try to be better collectively within our communities. Our guys on our team have done a great job giving back the last couple weeks. They’ve spoken to youth organizations and youth football teams, baseball teams, basically about what’s going on in society and about just everybody continuing to get better and keep their head down, to not be down about the times and just understand that this is a moment. And we have to be aware of the moment; we have to respect the moment; and we’re all fighting for a better cause and we need to all come out of this individually better. 
I think if we can do that individually, then collectively, you have better communities, you have better society, etc. So I commend our guys for being available to elementary and junior high kids by way of Zoom. We’ve set up some Zoom meetings with some youth teams and it’s been really impactful. The kids loved it.
So it was our idea to really encourage the youth as well. To understand that you’re not going through this alone. We’re all going through this together. Fight this fight and Fight On, really. So I’ll end it on that.

Police violence against Black people is nothing new, but never in American history has such graphic evidence of it been so readily available for consumption. You can’t hide from these videos — they’re all over social media. They are shared and reshared by people of all demographics, usually with captions demanding attention. Ostensibly, the goal in sharing these videos is to incite public outrage in hopes of facilitating meaningful change in a system that is resistant to even fractional reform.
The mediums of coverage and ease of dissemination might be new, but the public documentation of racist violence has a long history as a United States tradition. Perhaps the most notable example of this is the lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till. His mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, held an open-casket funeral for her son who was beaten beyond recognition, famously declaring, “let the people see what they did to my boy.” His image was widely published across African American newspapers and galvanized the Civil Rights Movement.
Just as Till was not the first or last victim of lynching, Till-Mobley was not the first or last person who understood the power of documented injustice to push forward racial justice. In the late 19th century, journalist Ida B. Wells heavily documented lynchings across the South. Over a century later, the infamous video of the Rodney King beating brought racist violence against Black people to the forefront of U.S. popular consciousness once again. 
Video evidence has enormous potential to hold bad actors and the state accountable for their actions. There is no equivalent to qualified immunity for victims of police violence, so, troublingly, it is not the fact that unarmed men are being shot in the back or choked to death that captures the public’s attention — it’s the videos, pictures and narratives. The public demands to see the worst, final moments of a victim’s life, to listen to a victim on the floor calling for their loved ones and narrating their own death. Only in the face of damning evidence is the deaths of Black people deemed worthy of inspection. The dissemination of these videos is, on some level, a necessary evil in the typically futile, public pursuit of justice.
But that does not fully rationalize the constant barrage of videos and images of Black deaths that populate my timeline (often slipping through algorithms designed to hide sensitive content). These images are important, but they deserve to be treated with dignity and sensitivity, not casually thrown on the feed alongside thirst traps and pictures from Sunday brunch. Compounding the problem, the prevalence of these videos on one’s timeline makes them unavoidable, often traumatizing unsuspecting users. This is especially harmful for Black people who can see themselves and their loved ones in the videos. 
I don’t know where the line between acceptable and unacceptable sharing of these videos lies. Should they only be shared in the news media (hopefully behind an age block)? Is their public consumption still necessary? It’s hard to imagine there is any person who is waiting for just one more video of police violence to fulfill some self-prescribed evidence quota to believe there is bias in policing. Those who get the reality of racism get it, and those who don’t, don’t. 
Whatever the case is, the callousness with which Black trauma is approached is not relegated to cases of police violence in the U.S. Mainstream U.S. publications have published images of Black African migrants who died crossing the Mediterranean and in terror attacks, along with a litany of terrible situations. Unlike U.S. videos of police violence, these images are without excuse: They don’t offer a crucial piece of the puzzle or tell of a perspective that would otherwise be missed. They are published just for the sake of it.
In a piece analyzing Western dismissal of Black trauma for The Atlantic, Hannah Giorgis utilized the book “In the Wake: On Blackness and Being” by Tufts University professor Christina Sharpe to characterize the way in which U.S. media and society covers and understands Black tragedy. A central argument of the book, which Giorgis was able to summarize with haunting precision, is that “black people do not easily earn sympathy, whether by dying in a plane crash or in an altercation with a police officer. Racist myths challenge the basic tenets of human compassion, even and especially in death. If black people are innately violent, if Africans live on an inherently backwards continent with fundamentally shoddy airlines, then their deaths are not tragedies. They are eventualities. They are facts, not stories.”
Having to write this piece is its own tragedy. Have we not progressed in the 65 years since Mamie Till-Mobley shared her son’s mangled body for the world to see? I want more than to wish for a future where videos aren’t necessary to achieve justice for victims of racist violence. I want a future without racist violence. But in the meantime, please allow me and your Black friends the grace of being able to scroll through the timeline without seeing videos of people that look like us being killed.

Writer and director Charlie Kaufman, with his previous films like “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and “Being John Malkovich,” possesses both a keen understanding of the mind and the ability to smoothly translate this understanding into film. In some ways expanding on those previous films, “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” paints a deliberately garbled and distorted, yet oddly captivating, portrait of the mind.
“I’m Thinking of Ending Things” thrusts the viewer into Lucy’s (Jessie Buckley) rambling poetic monologue that pessimistically describes her desire to end a relationship with a man named Jake (Jesse Plemons) as she goes on a road trip with him to his family’s farm. 
Near the beginning of the film, which is based on Iain Reid’s novel, the protagonist Lucy recites a poem while staring out a car’s frosted window into a thick snowstorm. Suddenly, she turns and stares straight into the camera, continuing the poem with a smirk, “Everything you see now, all of it bone.”
For the most part, the film possesses a delicate balance between organic human interaction and uncanny moments of absurdity until the balance tips in the third act, and the film indulges in the whimsicality of its premise.The opening monologue stream of consciousness eventually embraces and overpowers the film. Curiously, the film repeatedly cuts away from its contained premise to the life of a high school janitor (Guy Boyd). The janitor rarely has lines of dialogue, yet the entire film seems to revolve around him, gradually peering deeper into his psyche. 
A scene early on in the film where Lucy describes her paintings to Jake’s parents at a dinner table conversation functions as a microcosm for the film. Lucy says her paintings aren’t “abstract art,’’ but they are landscapes imbued with a quality of “interiority,” which she describes as an expression of what she is feeling at the time instead of what is physically present in the landscape. Her paintings express an emotional reality that the film also seems to embody. 
With somber shots of the janitor dragging his feet through empty yet claustrophobic school corridors, the film gives the viewer a sense of the “landscape” that the janitor lives within. Thus, it feels rather fitting for the entire film to be presented in an unconventional 4:3 aspect ratio, with the thick vertical black bars framing the film, mirroring the lockers and walls that frame a hallway. Much like Lucy’s paintings, the film is like a manifestation of the janitor’s emotional reality. 
The screenplay is littered with literary and cinematic allusions to works such as the film “A Woman Under the Influence” directed by John Cassavetes or the book “Ice” written by Anna Kavan and authors such as William Wordsworth, David Foster Wallace and Oscar Wilde. Although there is a sense of verisimilitude to the rambling and tangential nature of the conversations that naturally lead to someone mentioning one of these works, the intensely detailed analysis of these works of art seem to break this illusion of authenticity and enter the realm of unrestrained thought.
For instance, when Jake and Lucy are driving home, a casual conversation about being under the influence of alcohol reminds them of the aforementioned “A Woman Under the Influence.” Yet the discussion quickly spirals into Lucy narrating a verbose college paper she had written on it, which could feel somewhat jarring. While some viewers might identify these indulgent allusions as a product of pretension, they work to remind the viewer of the impressionistic reality that these characters live within as one being crafted by the janitor’s various engagements with media.
The cinematography, by Lukasz Zal and editing by Robert Frazen intricately translate the janitor’s sprawling mind. On one hand, the constraining aspect ratio and stillness of most shots encapsulate the stagnance of the janitor’s point of view. The camera movement usually consists of slow mechanical sideways panning, with rare zooms. Instead, jarring cuts are used to interrupt this stagnance to shift the point of view, encapsulating the mental process of indulgently thinking about something but suddenly shifting one’s thoughts to an entirely distinct idea. Moreover, the uniformity of this visual style effectively sets up the third act’s indulgence in the fantastical through an unexpected departure from it.  
In a way, the film’s core presents a continual conflict between the independence of the characters within the fantasy and the man who constructed it. Jake, a surrogate for the janitor, is described as controlling, whereas Lucy’s unrelenting flurry of thoughts seems uncontrollable. Similarly, the janitor wishes to construct an ideal love story within his head, but Lucy overpowers his thoughts, spiraling them out of control and into an unwanted traumatic past. This conflict is what seems to perpetually color the tense atmosphere of the film.
The musical and theatrical climax and ending of the film seem to indulge in fantasy, seemingly resolving this conflict; however, the credits are presented with a peculiar lack of music. Instead, they are backed by unsettling ambient sounds of birds chirping, and they end in the revving of a car engine, restarting the road trip, demonstrating a paradoxical refusal to end things.
