Over 30 people gathered Thursday in the Alumni House Boardroom to discuss the nature of governance, policy and leadership. The conversation, a “Lunch with a Leader” event hosted by the Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, was led by guest speaker Karina Macias, who fielded questions from USC students, faculty and alumni.
Hawken Miller | Daily TrojanPassion for politics · Karina Macias, who was elected the mayor of Huntington Park, Calif. in 2014, became interested in politics early in life.
Not only is Macias a member of the Huntington City Council, but she was also the youngest elected mayor in the history of the city in 2014.
Macias, who grew up in Huntington Park, Calif., explained that back in high school she was often called a “good troublemaker,” as her early interest in public policy encouraged her to get involved in political events like immigration reform rallies and anti-war movements.
Later on, after having obtained her bachelor’s degree in political science and psychology from Mount St. Mary’s University, Macias spent some time observing policies enacted in Washington, D.C., as well as in El Salvador and Honduras. Her travels enabled her to gain insight into the behind-the-scenes workings of local and international politics.
Coming back to Huntington Park, Macias became committed to attending council meetings. She would often try to address issues that went unnoticed by the governing body.
Macias said she often felt like “an outsider” who tried to draw attention to the problems the council was not focusing on by “listening to the community and their interests.” She felt responsible for giving a voice to those whose voices went unheard.
Through her grassroots campaign, Macias tried to let the public know that, as a woman raised by immigrant parents, she was prepared to do her best to improve the well-being of the community.
“I went to individual houses and explained to the people who I am and how I will make sure to come back and thank them for their vote,” Macias said.
Macias said she realized that no amount of resources in the world could guarantee a political victory. Instead, she sincerely believes in the significance of having one’s heart act as the driving force behind any cause.
Those who attended the lunch asked questions about immigration, affordable housing and the public school system. Macias, in turn, described the difficulties she faced handling controversial topics as mayor of Huntington Park.
“It felt like sometimes the council meetings became debates about immigration reforms,” Macias said.
When asked about how the council handled the media, Macias stressed the significance of running a transparent platform. One of her most important goals as mayor was to repair public trust in government officials.
In response to a student asking how to prepare for a career in public service, Macias explained the significance of taking issues into her own hands — sometimes literally —  and actually interact with the community.
“The public might have to see you cleaning up that alley,” Macias said.

The vision for Skillify started when USC alum Shireen Jaffer moved from Pakistan to Palo Alto, Calif. at age 7.
While attending high school in Palo Alto, Jaffer witnessed how the extreme pressures to do well in school damage students. There were six suicides among students from 2009 to 2010 in Palo Alto alone. During that time, Jaffer realized that she did not have the same connections as her peers who had lived in Palo Alto their whole lives. Jaffer said that by age 14 she had become a natural networker to gain a competitive edge. The networking skills that she developed in high school set the foundation for Skillify, which helps students succeed beyond the classroom.

“We are not doing a good job of showing students the true definition and meaning of their success,” Jaffer said. With Skillify, she wanted to “show students how to find their value” by learning applicable skills that were not taught in school.
Skillify provides virtual and one-on-one coaching for students as young as 15 to build their networking skills, prepare for the professional world and find mentorships and job shadows. In addition to one-on-one support, Skillify hosts a monthly conference at USC that bring together high school students to learn networking, communication and time management.
“I’m fortunate enough to have support for conferences at USC,” Jaffer said. “People realize that USC is their dream school, so I’m welcoming people into the Trojan Family.”
Jaffer has worked with high schools to introduce a curriculum that sets students up for success and hosted additional conferences there. College students are also participating in Skillify for the first time this year, because Jaffer believes too many college students are unable to realize their full potential.
“We want to help students go from minimum wage jobs to be able to pursue a paid internship that they would potentially get a career in,” Jaffer said.
In her sophomore year at USC, Jaffer launched what would one day be Skillify with seven students. The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies helped Jaffer build her startup, and in 2013, she rebranded to the name “Skillify” to reflect success that is dependent on skills rather than grades. Now, three years later, Jaffer said she works with 180 schools and 4,400 students. Jaffer hopes that her company helps students look at and approach success differently.
Jaffer is looking to expand to community college students, who she feels have more need than high school or university students. Community college students, according to Jaffer, are settling for jobs they don’t want and do not further their careers.
“If Starbucks is not part of your career path, it won’t add to career development,” Jaffer said.
In the essence of giving opportunities to all students, Skillify gives out scholarships to those who cannot afford tuition. Jaffer said that 60 percent of students in the program are from low-income families.
“We want to make sure we are accessible to students from all backgrounds so there is equal opportunity,” Jaffer said.

Starting Monday, the Metro Expo Line will run every six minutes for most of the day, according to Metro blog, The Source. The more frequent service is expected to reduce crowding and wait time for riders.
From Monday through Friday, trains will run every 10 to 12 minutes before 6 a.m., after which they will run every six minutes. Starting from 8 p.m., they will run every 10 to 12 minutes, and after 9 p.m., trains will run every 20 minutes.
On weekends, the Expo Line trains will run every 12 minutes, and every 20 minutes after 9 p.m. The service will speed up for special events, like football games. Most recently, when the Los Angeles Rams played the Seattle Seahawks at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 26 percent of attendees — 21,000 fans — were aboard the Metro, the most crowded it has ever been, according to The Source.
“I took a combination of Metro trains and buses to and from my internship all last summer,” said Zoe Cheng, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “The commute home is definitely really crowded, so trains arriving every six minutes will be much more convenient and comfortable for everyone.”
Currently, the Metro service during peak periods runs every seven minutes, with mostly two-car trains and some three-car trains. In the past, according to the Los Angeles Times, the Expo Line has been more than five minutes late 24 percent of the time, and during peak rush hour, has been delayed by more than five minutes 35 percent of the time. Metro officials have estimated between 15,000 to 20,000 boardings from noon to 4 p.m.
The number of three cars will increase with the addition of new Kinkisharyo light rail vehicles.

Five international students gathered Thursday to conduct a panel regarding international perspectives on the U.S. presidential elections. The panel was moderated by Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur in King Hall, and featured topics regarding media transparency, the electoral college and the two-party system, among others.
Schnur began the panel by asking the panelists questions about their countries’ perspectives on the presidential candidates and on the election as a whole. Frederik Pruss, a graduate student in the Master of Communication Management program, echoed many German citizens’ fears regarding the U.S. election trends.
“When it comes to content, people are starting to get very scared. Germans see how it’s going and they’re seeing that this year’s election is incredibly American-centric, very stigmatized against refugees and no one talks about the environment — no one seems to care about this very important aspect of the future,” Pruss said. “With people split up to such extreme sides and focusing only on themselves, Germans are afraid for the United States and for the world because the United States is such a global power.”
While Pruss worried about specific issues in the election, Francisco De Assis Magalhaes Paiva De Sousa, a senior majoring in business administration, provided a different perspective from Portugal. De Sousa saw Portugal, his native country, as surprisingly unknowledgeable about the candidates’ policies.
“My understanding is that the Portuguese are uninformed, because I think if they were to vote right now, it would be 80 percent for Hillary and 20 percent for Donald,” de Sousa said. “But if I asked them about issues without giving names, they would side more with Donald Trump’s issues than with Hillary Clinton’s.”
Amrish Ramnarine, a graduate student in the Cinematic Arts, Film and Television Production program, concurred with de Sousa about ignorance concerning the election. However, Ramnarine said that Trinidadians aligned themselves with candidates more according to demographics than policy positions.
“All the wealthy businessmen in Trinidad support Trump, because they want to see a businessman in government; most of these businessmen didn’t go to college and are self-learned people,” Ramnarine said. “The businessman logic is that if someone can run a business, he can definitely run a country. But all of the college students are for Hillary.”
Sumin Kim, a sophomore majoring in international relations and the global economy, explained that the most difficult aspect is knowing about the candidates’ platforms, but not knowing how they would implement them in office.
“It’s unclear what the United States is planning to do with the Pacific Rim in the upcoming years, even though we all know that both candidates want stronger trade relationships with Asian countries such as Korea,” Kim said. “In any case, I think that Korea would have to rethink its status in the United States’ Pacific Rim politics, because whoever wins the presidency will try to gain power in Asia by leveraging Japan’s support.”
After the panelists finished answering Schnur’s questions, they opened the floor up to the general audience. Questions and comments involved China, business-government relations and foreigners’ views of the U.S. status quo.
The importance of holding this panel, according to Schnur, was not necessarily to change people’s views about the presidential candidates, but to open people’s minds.
“There’s really some smart people across that divide, and even if you might not be convinced by them, there’s still something they can teach you,” Schnur said. “The only way any democracy functions is when we take the plugs out of our ears to listen to the other person’s music. We may not like it, but it’ll teach us something we otherwise wouldn’t have known.”

There aren’t many times in your life that you get a chance to recreate yourself in a new place and be whoever you want to be. When I transferred to USC in my sophomore year, I decided to recreate myself as a psychic. Yes friends, a psychic. Why? Well, I had watched a few documentaries online about how some psychics (save the real ones of course) were able to figure out anything about you through a series of deductive skills. I was hooked, and I wanted to try it out. In those documentaries, I learned that psychics figure you out by starting with things just vague enough so that they are always kind of correct. These vague statements are met with affirmation or denial through micro-cues such as minute changes in body posture, facial shape or voice.
Here’s an example: You can start by being vague and tell a college student that lately there has been a relationship on their mind. When they hear this, most will assume it’s a romantic relationship. Read their response to your statement — if it’s an affirmation through a head nod or leaning in, then proceed to make claims about that relationship, such as it has been tiring or it’s been a short time but it feels long, and proceed to make more deductions in that manner. If, however, they respond with a “no” with their body language, then simply reframe your statement. Say, “Well it’s not a romantic one. You’ve been thinking about someone you love, be it a friend or a family member.” In a situation they deny again, then broaden the love to themselves or to an object or whatever it is that gets a “yes” from them.
So here I am, a new student at USC, and I’ve learned this interesting hack of reading people. My name is Samuel Sunito, the new, weird, Australian student who claims to be psychic. I remember my first few weeks I would tell people that I was really good at reading people. I remember one girl who I had only known for a few hours challenged me: “You don’t know me. Prove it.” Definitely not a challenge you want to make. My pride was on the line now, so unfortunately I did as she asked.
There, in the presence of Tommy Trojan, at 2:30 in the morning (and remember friends, nothing good happens after 2 a.m.), I proceeded to deduce and tell her a whole gamut of things that were true about her. I told her about her relationship dynamic with her parents, the number of relationships she has been in and the hurt that she has felt from her most recent relationship (I even told her I knew his age and why they broke up, too). I told her she now finds it hard to trust people, and it has been a while since she’s opened up to someone. I told her some pretty random things too, like what hobbies she likes and how old her younger sister was.
At the end of my tirade, I paused and asked her, “But I’m just guessing. I’m not sure about any of that stuff. What do you think?”She looked up at Tommy Trojan, as if to look for a magical whispering statue behind her.  She eventually replied, “I don’t think I’ve ever felt so known before.” That night, she fell in love with me, and I decided to stop “reading” people.
Now, granted I actually didn’t really know her, it was still very interesting to me because in that moment, she felt really validated and loved. She literally sunk her shoulders as though a huge weight had been lifted off them. It got me thinking about our lives and how ultimately for our whole lives, we as people have a desire to be seen and to be known. This is especially true of us going through transitions in college, far away from loved ones and in new environments. There is a huge power in the ability to know someone and make them feel known.
I find that often in dating, we are focused on ourselves rather than the other person. We focus on trying to make ourselves attractive. We strive to present the best versions of ourselves, and we hope that the other person will appreciate it, like it and buy into it. But friends, there is something much more attractive and magnetic than your slicked, overly greasy hair (cause bro, nothing that touches it right now is getting unstuck). The attractive quality is in your ability to listen, understand and enter somebody else’s world. Loving people better is found in the random Snapchat you send of something you know that person likes. It’s found in the, “Hey, let’s go here. I know you love this type of place” and the, “Hey, I don’t know much about [insert romantic interest’s interest], but I did some reading on it. What do you think about it?” When it comes to loving people too, we sometimes try to love people the ways that we think we would feel loved, and it can feel frustrating when they don’t receive it the way we thought they would. Loving people better comes through understanding them and what they value.
In our selfie-, iPhone-, MySpace- (I am sure some of you freshmen don’t even know what that is) and Me-generation, I pose that a better way to love others is to become a psychic of sorts, figure out your loved ones and communicate that you know and see them.
Samuel Sunito is a junior majoring in business administration.  His column, “Love and Other Things,” runs every other Friday.

Three-quarters of the way through Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Tom Cruise is on a plane and about to knock out a bunch of villains when it starts to feel like a flashback from 2011. That was the same year he starred in the film Knight & Day, a romantic-action-comedy film where Cruise beats up a plane full of different villains as Cameron Diaz puts on lipstick in the lavatory.
In Knight & Day, the effect is charming, but by the time we get to this same moment in Jack Reacher, the story is so far gone that any awe-inspiring moment or chance to maybe just say, “Hey that’s cool,” has leapt right out of the proverbial airplane window. It becomes clear that the title Never Go Back — Tom Cruise’s first return to the big screen in almost a year —  might unfortunately resonate in more ways than one.
Photo courtesy of Paramount PicturesTwice the action · Cobie Smulders joins Tom Cruise in the 2016 film Jack Reacher: Never Go Back as Susan Turner and Jack Reacher, respectively.
At the beginning of the film, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) goes on a date with Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) — a young military woman who he has been helping solve cases remotely from around the country. As Reacher’s calls turn less professional and more personal, the two make tentative plans to have dinner one day. When Reacher finally arrives in D.C., he learns that Turner has been relieved of her duty and charged with espionage.
As Reacher attempts to rescue her, he learns that he can’t get involved because of a warrant out for his arrest. Apparently, Reacher hasn’t paid child support. When he tells the attorney that he doesn’t have children, the attorney shrugs and states a woman with a 15-year-old daughter named Samantha (Danika Yarosh) has claimed Reacher is the father. When Reacher goes to visit Samantha, she quickly skulks away. For the remainder of the film, Reacher struggles to juggle both women as he attempts to clear Turner’s name and hunt down the truth of Samantha’s paternity.
This second installment, directed by Edward Zwick, arrives four years after its predecessor, directed deftly by Christopher McQuarrie, became a relative box-office success and started another action franchise for Cruise, separate from his Mission Impossible series. Yet, while the first Reacher was also written by McQuarrie, Never Go Back seems to suffer from a changing of hands, not only because of Zwick but also other screenwriters.
In the opening scene of the film, an angry police officer balks at the hunched over figure of Jack Reacher, demanding, “Who the hell are you?” Reacher replies, “The guy you didn’t count on.”
Photo courtesy of Paramount PicturesReach for it · Tom Cruise returns as Jack Reacher in the highly-anticipated sequel of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. The film is based on Lee Child’s book Never Go Back, the 18th installment of the novel series.
Reacher’s promise is enticing, but problematic. The way the story sets up Reacher’s character, there’s never a moment when we don’t count on him, which, of course, shouldn’t be a problem for any other protagonist in any other film. What made the first Jack Reacher so brilliant was the distrust in the lead’s ability to solve the mystery or even end up on the right side of the law by the film’s end. But with all this busy work with the daughter storyline, Reacher loses himself in menial plot development and even further in meaningless dialogue.
But the problem doesn’t end with Reacher’s accountability. Tom Cruise’s near-mythic persona eliminates any ounce of believability throughout the film, beginning with the montage of Reacher hitch-hiking his way across America in the first act. Let’s get one thing straight: Tom Cruise is not an every man — and for however much the filmmakers want Jack Reacher to be in this sequel, they fail, because Jack Reacher isn’t an every man either.
The first Jack Reacher film prided itself on a sleekness and mystery; we never quite knew where or who he was, and by the film’s end, we still sort of didn’t. In this film, all cards are played out on the table by the end of the first act, so what follows feels more like a visually weary cousin of Jack Reacher, where the lead is more driven by his libido than by a true thirst for justice or revenge. The age discrepancy between Smulders and Cruise also serves as a jarring misstep. For all of Smulder’s demeanor and physical prowess (exemplified by the many running scenes throughout), their chemistry just doesn’t work.
The action set pieces, however, are splendid. Save for the final showdown set in the New Orleans French Quarter during Halloween (which reads more like a cheaper version of Spectre’s 2015 opening sequence through Mexico’s Day of the Dead celebration) the action is exciting and taut. A particularly good sequence takes place in the military prison cell as Reacher attempts to rescue Turner by bamboozling a lawyer and playing mirror tricks with several hallways and video cameras. It’s visually just the right amount of interesting, confusing and comprehensible.
In the first film, the District Attorney asks a detective on the case, “How do we find this Jack Reacher?” To which the agent replies seriously, “You don’t find this guy unless he wants to be found.” It’s an iconic moment, emphasized by the fact that Jack Reacher shows up at the men’s office door mere seconds later. Unfortunately, the Jack Reacher in Never Go Back loses himself among all the mayhem, making us wish maybe we shouldn’t have found him again after all.

Imagine Regina George lying dead from the bus accident instead of injured in a humorous body brace. That’s Heathers — the dark satirical movie starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. With upbeat songs about blue balls, rape and suicide, Heathers is a musical matched perfectly with its source material, one of the most controversial movies of its time. USC alum and long-time composer Laurence O’Keefe teamed up with Desperate Housewives writer Kevin Murphy to create Heathers: The Musical, which ran off-Broadway in 2014. Rumored to be coming to Broadway sometime next year, USC Musical Theater Repertory’s production is a can’t-miss show.
Julianna Keller, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science, stars in Heathers as Veronica Sawyer, a too-good-for-this-town nerd who decides that befriending the most popular clique in school will grant her freedom from the low-lifes she is forced to go to school with. This almighty popular clique — crowned “the Heathers” from the shared name of the three girls — does not accept Veronica without quid pro quo. Veronica’s uncanny ability to forge anyone’s handwriting tempts the Heathers enough to include her in their mean girl shenanigans. Like any high school heroine would, Veronica realizes being friends with mean girls is more of a burden than she was expecting. However, when Veronica meets the mysterious new kid, J.D., she is swept off her feet from his tragic past and nonchalant penchant for quoting poetry. The two start dating, but before long, J.D. goes from damaged to deranged, forcing Veronica to make some life or death decisions.
Photo courtesy of Musical Theatre Repertory at USCMean girls · Sophomore Julianna Keller (above) plays the role of Veronica Sawyer in Heathers: The Musical. The show, the theatrical adaptation of the 1998 cult film Heathers, became a hit production off-Broadway in 2014.
The original screenplay by Daniel Waters is the black-satire comedy that drew audiences to and away from the film when it was released in 1988. The musical keeps with the spirit of the film and handles dark issues in the same uncomfortably upbeat way. For instance, the two jocks, played by the electric duo Tristan McIntyre and Patrick Olsen, go through many antics to get girls in their beds. Their numbers are spectacular to watch and depressing to think about, giving their characters a magnetic quality.
Specifically, the actor who plays Ram, freshman theatre major Tristan McIntyre, is unequivocally the star of the show with his dance moves. Keller carries the show admirably and is complemented by moments of brilliance from her co-star Sean Soper,  a sophomore majoring in theatre, who plays J.D. Admittedly, one of the best numbers of the whole show features none of the leads but Tyler Ellis and Michael Takla singing about loving their “gay, dead sons” before unabashedly revealing their own homosexual feelings toward one another in a magnificent number. As for the rest of the cast, they are all in, dancing their hearts out, committing to every simulated blow job and dry hump like their life depends on it. When it comes to the music, it might sound strange at first, but just listen. The lyrics have too much acerbic wit for their own good, forcing audience members to let out a disturbing chuckle. The live band, consisting of drums, strings and keyboards, was a wonderful touch, even if too loud during some of the songs.
Perhaps what is so triumphant about the entire show is that the director, Jack McCarthy, is only a sophomore.
“To me, Heathers tells the story of young people searching for love, acceptance and beauty in a damaged world. Who isn’t excluded from feeling a need for love?” McCarthy said. “Although our world certainly isn’t perfect, Heathers show us that if we could accept our collective damaged state and find a way to love in spite of the pain … Well, we can still make the world beautiful.”
Teen angst has been handled in several musicals before, such as in Spring Awakening, Hairspray and Grease, but Heathers is more than horny teens struggling against parents — unless you add in rape, abusive relationships, homophobia, teen suicide, parent disapproval, murder and school shootings. Do not let the depressing sounds of these words keep from seeing this spectacularly well-done show. Heathers makes the audience think about some of society’s biggest issues. The remaining showtimes are  Oct. 21 at 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., Oct. 22 at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Oct. 23 at 2:30 p.m.
The show is playing at the Massman Theater. Tickets are free. For more information, go online.

This weekend could prove pivotal for the men’s water polo team as the Trojans (15-1) travel to Long Beach State on Saturday afternoon to battle the No. 6 49ers (11-5) for the second time this season.
Katie Chin | Daily TrojanDive on in · Senior driver Nick Bell and the Trojans are playing No. 6 LBSU on the road on Saturday. In their previous game, USC won, 9-4.
USC’s 66-15 all-time record against LBSU signifies recent Trojan dominance, as the Men of Troy have claimed 27 straight games against the 49ers in recent years.
This Saturday, however, Beach will be hosting USC with heavy momentum after two top-25 wins over UCSD (10-6) and Pepperdine (7-4) this past week.
Their defense is different from USC’s in that it does not rely on steals or blocks, per se, but rather on Australian goalie Thomas Freeman, who has saved 97 of 168 shot attempts. While his save percentage may not be as high as USC junior goalie McQuin Baron’s, Freeman has allowed only 1.2 more goals per game.
On the offensive side of the ball, the 49ers are efficient with their possessions, netting 75.8 percent of all shot attempts.
According to senior driver Nick Bell, this game could be potentially different with 6-foot-7, 285-pound center Duncan Lynde back in the lineup for Long Beach.
“We’ve scrimmaged with them in the summer so we know the different ways they play and some of their players. We’ve definitely taken some different steps to prepare for them this time,” Bell said. “They’re going to have their big guy back which changes our game plan.”
Baron and his 13 saves kept leading 49er scorers Nolan McConnell (31 goals) and Keegan Wicken (15 goals) at bay. Baron and the USC defense could be challenged by not just McConnell and Wicken, but also 49er sharpshooter Austin Stewart who has scored 14 goals off of 17 shots.
Against the No. 7 UC Santa Barbara Gauchos last weekend, the Men of Troy gave the USC home crowd a reason to cheer with a 16-6 win despite the Guachos playing the Trojans to a 4-4 tie in the first half.
In the victory, the USC offense was firing on all cylinders, with junior driver Blake Edwards netting a hat trick and his 100th career goal within the first two periods of play.
As the 33rd Trojan in program history in the 100-goal club, Edwards leads the team with 32 goals this season and will be a big factor against a Long Beach team that allowed Edwards to score two of USC’s nine goals back in September.
In a 9-4 USC victory that saw seven different Trojans score goals, USC dominated on the defensive side of the ball and went into the final frame with a 7-2 lead.
“We go into every game like it’s the championship game. Defense is one of the things that [head coach Jovan] Vavic always stresses,” Bell said. “Defense wins championships and it’s the backbone of our whole system. McQuin Baron has been doing a great job and locking it down in the cage this season.”
Despite the challenge ahead, the team is confident.
“He’s a lefty which makes him a huge threat. He’s very good and we’ll have to pay a lot of attention to stopping him,” junior utility Mihajlo Millicevic said of McConnell. “Overall, I don’t think he’s going to be a huge problem for us. We can stop him.”

The high-90s heat beat down on McAlister Field Thursday afternoon, as No. 5 women’s soccer hosted Washington State. The Women of Troy came out on top 3-0 in a grueling battle with the Cougars, thanks to goals from junior midfielder Nicole Molen, sophomore forward Leah Pruitt and sophomore forward Hailey Hite.
Katie Smith | Daily TrojanGoal driven · Sophomore forward Leah Pruitt scored the Women of Troy’s second goal of the day. The soccer team is ranked No. 5 and has won their second-straight victory. They defeated Washington State, 3-0.
The temperature made playing conditions brutal, especially early in the second half. Redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme, who locked up her 10th clean sheet of the season, said the heat tired players out quickly.
“It definitely affects the game in the fact that you get tired really quickly. It drains your energy. It drains your water,” Prudhomme said. “But the key was to just keep hydrating throughout the game.”
Head coach Keidane McAlpine agreed with his keeper and praised the Women of Troy for a great team effort in a game with heavy personnel rotation.
“I think both teams got a little sloppy at times. I think you saw people fatigue a little quicker than normal,” McAlpine said. “So it was one of those days when we were using a lot of players, and having players come in and actually execute was very, very good for us.”
Officials helped the teams recover by calling two short water breaks during the game — one in each half.
USC and the Cougars went back and forth early, with neither side able to stake its claim on the match. But after a Trojan shot turned onto the post in the 23rd minute, Molen volleyed in the rebound to make the Trojan breakthrough. Washington State rallied after conceding, though, and the Women of Troy took their 1-0 lead into the half only thanks to two key saves from Prudhomme in one-on-one opportunities.
“Sammy Jo has been so good,” McAlpine said. “That’s what she’s been doing all year: making big saves look simple and making simple saves look real easy. She gives us confidence.”
Despite the praise, however, McAlpine was disappointed with USC’s sluggish first period.
“Washington State … jumped on us, and it took us a while to figure out what they were doing and deal with it, which was a little disappointing,” he said. “I didn’t think we matched their energy.”
The Women of Troy adjusted in the locker room, and they seized the game by the throat just a few minutes after the second-half restart. Pruitt turned her defender on the left flank and cut inside. After playing a one-two with redshirt junior Alex Anthony, the sophomore found herself with only the keeper to beat, and she dribbled around goalie Ella Dederick and buried her shot to double USC’s advantage.
Prudhomme said Pruitt’s goal was a turning point in the contest. From then on, the Women of Troy were in rhythm and dictated the tempo.
“It gave us a little more cushion, and I think it kind of discouraged [Washington State],” she said. “That helped us, because after that, we pretty much took control of the game.”
Indeed, aside from rattling the crossbar late, the Cougars were declawed for most of the final 45 minutes. Hite put the result beyond any doubt with seven minutes to play, rolling a pass from redshirt senior Katie Johnson past Dederick from point-blank range to make it 3-0.
USC has now won two straight games after suffering its first loss in over a month against Cal in early October, and the team remains just one game behind undefeated Pac-12 leader Colorado.
“We know any of these teams in our league can get a result on any day,” he said. “We’ve got to do our part and keep winning, and hopefully when it all shakes out, we’re sitting at the top by ourselves.”
Next up for USC is Washington, who visits McAlister Field on Sunday. The Women of Troy look to make it three wins on the trot against the Huskies.

On Sunday, Colin Kaepernick will make his second start of the season when the San Francisco 49ers play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. When the national anthem plays before the game, he will likely take a knee. The cameras will flash, social media will explode and criticism will keep flowing.
Photo from WikicommonsPeaceful protest · San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has come under fire for refusing to stand during the national anthem.
Indeed, the saga surrounding one of the most divisive figures in sports history will live another week. And boy, has this — a high-profile professional athlete protesting racial injustice and police brutality by refusing to respect his nation’s flag — ever divided us.
Everyone has a take on this. President Barack Obama defended it. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg called it “dumb and disrespectful.” Athletes and coaches across all sports have been quoted on it.
People turned in death threats, burned his jersey and called him a traitor and names far worse. ESPN talking head Trent Dilfer had the hilarious opinion that Kaepernick should “be quiet” because he was a backup. Last Sunday, when Kaepernick made his first start of the season in Buffalo, Bills’ fans sold shirts with a picture of a rifle scope aimed at the quarterback. Critics labeled him a spoiled attention grabber, claiming a man who makes millions playing football has no right to disrespect the flag while soldiers are dying overseas for his freedom.
To me, these people are missing the point. For one, I don’t believe Kaepernick is doing this to seek attention. Those who have followed him since his rookie season know that he hated dealing with the media, oftentimes brushing aside questions during press conferences. This was back in 2013, when he led the 49ers to the Super Bowl appearance and was considered an up-and-coming-star. Now, he’s a has-been who couldn’t even beat out Blaine Gabbert for the starting job when he started his protest. Why would Kaepernick risk his reputation and the rest of his career just to make a political statement?
More importantly, those who continue to condemn Kaepernick are more focused on the nature of his protest rather than the protest itself. I would argue the broader message is always more important than how it is being delivered (assuming it is non-violent). However, while everybody is for better race relations and less police brutality, for some, seeing someone overtly disregard the flag is an automatic turn-off.
It shouldn’t be. Kaepernick has repeatedly stated he is not trying to offend the country, the military or the flag. He is using his platform as an athlete to advocate for an issue he cares about deeply. If you or I sat during the national anthem before a game, nobody would care. But because Kaepernick has a following and is a pro athlete, he knows his actions will ignite a discussion, and he’s done it.
In the weeks that have passed since he started his protest, he’s gotten people talking about race, about what our flag represents and about the requirements of patriotism. Before his protest, I never thought about why the national anthem is played before virtually every sporting event across America. I just went along with it, assuming it was a tradition. But it’s a fair — if controversial — question to ask: Are we obligated to display unconditional love for this country just because we paid for a ticket to watch a game? If so, then why isn’t the anthem played before, say, we watch a movie or go to a concert? How is a football game connected to one’s feelings toward America?
These are obviously contentious points, and it’s understandable for some who have a deep connection to the flag or are in the military to disagree. I know members of the ROTC on campus who are steadfast in their opposition to Kaepernick, and they say their peers almost unanimously feel the same way. I don’t blame them. They feel like Kaepernick is a traitor. They feel like he’s stepping on the flag, wiping his shoes all over it and spitting on the soldiers who fight every day for his freedom. They feel like he’s un-American.
But I’d argue that what he’s doing makes America great. He is vindicating — not disrespecting — the soldiers who fought for his freedom because the alternative would be the very opposite of what America stands for: him being silenced, unable to speak out at all as a dissident.
Kaepernick said as much after last week’s game in Buffalo, where he was loudly booed by fans who loudly chanted “USA” before he took a knee.
“I don’t understand what’s more American than fighting for liberty and justice for everybody, for the equality this country says it stands for,” he said. “To me, I see it as very patriotic and American to uphold the United States to the standards it says it lives by.”
Racial injustice and police brutality are very real problems in this country, and it’s not going to be solved by people screaming and yelling that someone decided to exercise his First Amendment rights. Those who call Kaepernick a traitor without even considering what drove him to make such a dramatic protest are ignoring the bigger issue for which he is fighting. If there’s one thing we’ve learned by what Kaepernick has done — which has dragged on nearly two months — it’s that the longer it lasts, the more truth serum is injected into America regarding how uncomfortable our society still is about discussing race.
However, to end on a positive, we’ve also learned the power of a simple action to spark a much bigger action. It’s refreshing to see so many athletes stand with him and even join in protest, from fellow NFL players to U.S. women’s national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe. The hashtag #VeteransForKaepernick was a nice example that social media does indeed have a humanistic side to it. But most importantly — regardless of how you feel about the method of protest — the fact that we are still talking about Kaepernick means that what he did worked.
Colin Kaepernick may not end racism, but us holding hands, singing “Kumbayah” and pretending everything is fine won’t do anything either. We cannot solve societal issues unless we confront them head on and find solutions, no matter how awkward it may be. Kaepernick has forced the issue and sparked an important dialogue — and all it took was a knee.

Proposition 55 is a step in the right direction for returning education in California to pre-recession funding levels. Entitled the Tax Extension to Fund Education and Healthcare Initiative Constitutional Amendment, it extends the temporary personal income tax increases (enacted in 2012 on earnings over $250,000 for single filers, or over $340,000 for heads of household) for the next 12 years until 2030. Eighty-nine percent of these new tax revenues would be allocated to K-12 schools, and 11 percent would go to California community colleges. It bars the use of these revenues for administrative costs, but provides local school boards discretion to decide, in open meetings that are subject to annual audit, how revenues are to be spent. A “No” vote on this measure means that these income tax increases would expire as scheduled at the end of 2018. California voters should support Proposition 55, as it will prevent a $4 billion cut to school funding and continue to restore cuts made during the recession.
The funding generated from this Proposition could range from $4 billion to $9 billion each year from 2019 to 2030 (depending on the economy and the stock market). Roughly half of the revenue would increase funding for schools and community colleges, whereas upwards of $2 billion would increase funding for healthcare for low-income citizens. The State Constitution requires California to spend a minimum amount on K–12 schools and community colleges each year. This “minimum guarantee” increases over time based on growth in state tax revenues, the economy and student attendance. This year, the state general fund will provide over $50 billion toward the minimum guarantee, which is over half of the state’s total budget of $122 billion.
Proposition 55 only affects roughly 1.5 percent of taxpayers with the highest incomes. Proposition 55 would extend these 1-percent, 2-percent and 3-percent increases which were already established by the existing Proposition 30. In other words, these high-income earners would not be taxed any additional amount — Proposition 55 would simply extend the tax increases that were supposed to expire in 2018, until 2030.
Proposition 55 has strict transparency and accountability requirements to ensure educational funds get to the classroom. Strict accountability requirements ensure funds designated for education go to classrooms, not to bureaucracy or administrative costs, and it authorizes criminal prosecution for any misuse of money. Moreover, Proposition 55 requires mandatory audits, so local school districts must post annual accounting reports to guarantee that citizens know exactly how the money is being spent. This, in turn, provides local control over school funding, as it gives control to school boards to determine how best to use the funds for students’ needs. The state needs an estimated 22,000 additional teachers next year alone. Proposition 55 gives local school districts the money they need to hire teachers and prevent overcrowded classes. It also helps to restore arts and music classes that were removed from schools because of budget cuts during the recession. In terms of the aid given to California community colleges, these funds would help make college more affordable, as they prevent cuts to community colleges, preventing tuition increases and expanding course offerings. Lastly, it increases funding for healthcare for low-income families, as too many families cannot afford basic healthcare, which results in students missing more school days. Proposition 55 helps kids come to school healthy and ready to learn, because all children deserve access to quality education — not just the wealthiest Californians.

Earlier this month, The Washington Post released a tape of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump boasting about his ability to “kiss” women and “grab” them by the genitals without their consent, claiming that when a man is rich he can “do anything” to women. What followed was a slew of allegations from women who claimed Trump had subjected them to the exact manner of treatment he described in the video, along with renewed attention on existing allegations. These ranged from business partners and reporters to an unnamed plaintiff, who claims she was 13 years old when Trump allegedly raped her.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
In a Monday interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Trump’s wife Melania Trump was tasked with offering her side of the story and attempted to humanize him, who has subsequently been widely portrayed as a sexual predator. When it came to the accusations of assault levied against her husband, Melania Trump responded: “I believe my husband. This was all organized from the opposition. And with the details that they go, did they ever check the background of these women? They don’t have any facts.”
Melania Trump’s refusal to believe the accusations against her husband is understandable, but her justification that Americans should assess the validity of these claims by poring through the “backgrounds” of these women advances a dangerous myth propagated by rape culture — that in order to believe women who report assault, these women must be perfect. Despite statistically low rates of false reporting from assault victims, they must have flawless histories and nearly bulletproof narratives involving conservative attire, no alcohol and no sexual history in order to be believed. In citing their backgrounds as relevant evidence to dispute their claims, Melania Trump plays into the dangerously high standards society puts on victims and survivors of sexual assault.
This tactic was similarly used by her husband, who not only led smear campaigns against the women accusing him based on their pasts and encouraging supporters to do same, but additionally cited the appearances of his accusers to defend himself from their claims. Of People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff who accused him of groping and kissing her against her will, Trump said, “Look at her, I don’t think so”; of another accuser, Trump said she “would not be [his] first choice.”
Just as some believe assault accusations against former President Bill Clinton were politically charged, many Trump supporters have also argued the allegations are motivated by politics. They question why the women didn’t come forward earlier, as the dates of the accusations range from the 1980s to 2013.
Criticizing and doubting individuals who report their experiences after a substantial amount of time has elapsed is another tactic to dismiss and write off victims, who understandably hold their silence to avoid retribution, attacks on their character, stigma and abuse, all of which the women accusing Trump have faced since coming forward. With audio of Trump apparently boasting about his ability to assault women, it is likely that Trump’s accusers understandably believed they would have considerably more credibility coming forward.
In the same interview with Cooper, it is worth noting how Melania Trump likens her husband, who was 59 years old at the time he made these controversial comments, to a “teenage boy” who was “egged on” by television personality Billy Bush, despite the fact that Trump seemed to bring up the topics  and boast about his treatment of women by his own accord. This facet of the interview offers just one more glimpse of the many ways men accused of abuse are absolved of responsibility, which in turn is shifted to demonized female victims.
Questioning the credibility of victims by bringing up irrelevant aspects of their pasts, criticizing when they choose to report and highlighting circumstances of the men in question that humanize them all serve as methods to often absolve powerful men like Trump of responsibility. Melania Trump, her husband and his supporters have all fallen back on a culture that is far too demanding of victims of assault and lenient on its perpetrators to defend him. This country needs to begin to support assault survivors. Tearing them down feeds into an already vicious rape culture and threatens equality under the law.
Hey Kylie, I hate to burst your bubble, but here goes…  Pop!  As you hear these accusations, does it occur to you that maybe, just maybe, these are bull$%&#?  All these women decide it is high time to air out their repressed memories of the alleged actions ONE month before the elections, and that does not warrant any suspicions on your part?  I have some swampland in Florida I can sell you at a very good price.
Men are automatically guilty because of their gender?  Women can’t be judged or investigated based on criminal complaints made?  What color is the sky on your planet?

Fourteen years ago, Macon Phillips was shucking oysters in Alabama. Today, he is the coordinator of the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. 
At “Connecting People to Policy,” an event organized by the USC Center for Public Diplomacy, Phillips spoke in depth about his career and how the U.S. government implements digital strategy. 
The Director of the CPD, Jay Wang, believes that individuals like Phillips provide valuable insight to USC students. 
“We hope that students can better understand the skills required to do effective public diplomacy work in the digital age,” Wang said. 
For Phillips, his exposure to international relations and domestic policy issues didn’t occur until he joined the Americorps VISTA and began working for an interim program in Vermont. 
“This was when George Bush was sabre-rattling to Iraq and Colin Powell was shaking up the UN,” Phillips said. “Some of it didn’t make sense to me, and I later realized our world was run by human beings who have strong opinions.”
In 2004, Phillips started working on political projects at Blue State Digital, a web design firm. Though digital tools were in their infancy, they were growing rapidly. 
“YouTube, Facebook, Twitter: none of that stuff existed in 2004,” Phillips said. “In the last 10 years, everything has changed. It’s an incredible time to be alive.” 
In 2008, Phillips became a digital strategist for the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign. When Obama was elected, Phillips took on a new role as the director of new media for Obama’s presidential transition team. 
“On the first day, when the president was taking the oath of office, I was at a cubicle launching whitehouse.gov,” Phillips said. 
At the White House, Phillips focused on fulfilling three goals: amplifying the administration’s message, making the administration’s work more accessible and creating meaningful opportunities for people to participate in different initiatives. 
In September 2013, Phillips was hired as the IIP coordinator. He said the organization supports public policy efforts that shape the news of the day while simultaneously developing long-term relationships between different communities. 
One of the notable projects IIP has been involved with is the Young African Leaders Initiative. The initiative originated as a traditional exchange program that soon became overwhelmed with applications. To solve this, the State Department formed a network that would connect the young leaders with each other and offer them courses in issues like women’s empowerment and climate change. Today, YALI currently connects 250,000 members, many of whom organize their own advocacy events, according to Phillips. 
The success of YALI, Phillips said, can serve as a model for future digital policy initiatives. 
“We’ve developed a network that possesses its own energy. The U.S. government has catalyzed this group of young leaders,” Phillips said. “YALI is an example of a project in Africa that’s actually helping us with our diplomacy interests.”
However, Phillips recognizes that the government faces a number of challenges when trying to use digital strategy to stimulate public policy initiatives. The first is the state’s passivity.
Phillips explained that the state department has always just disseminated information to the world. Only a small group of officials had the agency to bring about policy changes. Now, with social media platforms and other tools, people are able to instigate changes themselves. The U.S. government, Phillips argues, must take on a more proactive role. 
“In a world of connected and empowered non-state actors, we have to figure out how we can call people to action,” Phillips said. “My colleague once said ‘public diplomacy used to be about telling people what they need to know. Now it’s about telling people what they need to do.’ Individuals have more power; they’re able to organize themselves. Institutions like the U.S. government have to not just inform them, but influence and motivate them.” 
Another challenge concerns how the state department shares and organizes information. 
“The State Department is a giant organization. As a result, we tend to share information inefficiently,” Phillips said. “We need to find ways to create a ‘default: open’ culture. So, we’ve broken down the walls in our offices, we’ve implemented tools like Slack. But that’s something we’ve got to keep improving.” 
For Virana Khairunnisaa, a masters student studying public diplomacy, Phillips’ experiences will help her grow own career. 
“I work as an officer handling digital diplomacy for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Indonesia,” Khairunnisaa said. “I think learning from other peoples’ experiences in the field is so much more helpful than learning theory.”

Robots are coming to us — not in the way they did in the 2004 film I, Robot or in the Terminator series- — but as companions. Students can now make their dream of making a robot friend come true. As a collaborative effort of SoftBank Robotics America and the on-campus clothing store the Ave at USC, a humanoid robot named Pepper will be visiting USC and staying on the third floor of the bookstore from Oct. 18 to Oct. 20. Pepper will be greeting the customers, informing them about the Ave and helping them customize shoes.
“We hope the students on USC’s campus actively come to visit Pepper at the Ave and have a full Pepper experience over the next few days,” said Jamie Soper, PR manager of SoftBank Robotics America. “The experience will give students a glimpse into the future of retail and how they might interact with Pepper on a daily basis in the very near term.”
Pepper is an autonomous, talking humanoid robot that is capable of perceiving emotions and interacting with the people around her by adapting her behavior to the mood of the people around her. She was created by engineers at SoftBank Robotics in 2014 and made her first retail debut in SoftBank mobility stores. Based on the perceived body language, Pepper builds empathy and responds accordingly. 
“Pepper can identify joy, sadness, anger or surprise and respond appropriately, making his interactions with humans incredibly natural and intuitive,” Soper said. “At the heart of Pepper is a remarkable technology that analyses what you say, your tone of voice and nonverbal communication cues like the tilt of your head or posture.”
USC is the first college campus Pepper has visited. 
“Our goal is to give the students a glimpse of what’s to come and get them comfortable interacting with Pepper in any given business environment such as retail,” Soper said.
SBRA is the newly established North American headquarters of SoftBank Robotics Holdings. According to Soper, SBRA robots are used in more than 70 countries worldwide and offer innovative applications in the fields of research, education, retail, healthcare, tourism, hospitality and entertainment.
The Ave, with Pepper helping out, was packed. Arnesh Sujanani, a sophomore majoring in economics, did not expect Pepper to be so advanced, though mentioned it had its shortfalls. 
“I was surprised by its high tech interactivity,” Sujanani said. “It immediately recognized my presence and made motions to interact with me. I was however, disappointed by its lack of movement, in terms of feet movement, capabilities. It was mostly stationery. Overall, I was still impressed by Pepper.”
Nick Romero, the owner and the founder of the Ave, found Pepper useful in gaining attention of customers. 
“So far, Pepper has been interacting with guests. He definitely has been an attraction as far as getting people come in, showing different products, explaining history about the Ave,” Romero said. “After seeing Pepper working for three hours so far, I think it is pretty cool, but I can see what we can improve on.”

As a long-time collector of all types of robot toys, many electronic and some of those interactive as well, I can’t wait to get a pepper robot. Originally, the launch date for US consumer purchase was reported to be by summer 2015 but that has come and gone. Maybe by summer of 2017 if I’m lucky.

Students crowded into Wallis Annenberg Hall for a viewing of the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday evening. Debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president were some of the issues raised, and for both candidates this was their last chance to face off against each other before Election Day on Nov. 8.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and USC Annenberg’s Center of Communication Leadership and Policy co-hosted the event, which included a pre-debate and post-debate panel. The panel featured Nick Germain from USC College Democrats; Alan Arkatov, the Katzman/Ernst Chair for Educational Entrepreneurship, Technology and Innovation for USC Rossier School of Education; Mary Perez, the vice president of USC College Republicans; and Justin Wallin, chief operating officer and chief marketing officer at Probolsky Research. Moderators included Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Lily Vaughan, editorial director at the Daily Trojan. 
The crowd cheered as the final debate began and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton walked onto the stage, yet booed when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump walked onto the stage. 
Wallin said the debate would not change voters’ minds about who to vote for. 
“The election is set. The winner on this was really [moderator Chris] Wallace who I think did a remarkable job, and for once allowed for a sensitive talk about policies,” Wallin said. “If you listened, there were some distinct differences between the candidates, but I don’t think in terms of the election it did anything whatsoever.”
Germain discussed what he termed one of Clinton’s more memorable moments. 
“I believe the most memorable moment of the night was when Donald Trump leveraged an attack against Secretary Clinton that she had essentially accomplished nothing over her 30 years in public life, and she countered that with a decade-by-decade juxtaposition of what she was doing during that time and what Donald Trump was also embarrassingly doing at the same time,” Germain said. “I think that moment stuck with me and stuck with many voters at home.”
Perez argued that though Donald Trump didn’t strengthen his stance with voters, he managed to not hurt his position.
“He did an adequate job in remaining civil in comparison to the first two debates,” Perez said. “I think many people already knew who they were going to vote for and this debate didn’t change that.” 
Nick Hernandez, a sophomore majoring in accounting, was among those watching the debate and was one of the few cheering for Trump.
“I support Trump because Clinton has lied so much, and if she does become president, it will be like having another Obama term,” Hernandez said. “Trump will fix our economy, and if Clinton gets elected, nothing will change.” 
Sandra Chang, a junior majoring in communication, cheered as Clinton gave her closing statement asking for the votes of every American. 
“I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she is the candidate with the experience needed to lead our country,” Chang said. “Trump will destroy every single thing I love about this country. He is racist, sexist, homophobic and completely unfit to be president.”
Students were also able to register to vote during the event. 

Students crowded into Wallis Annenberg Hall for a viewing of the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday evening. Debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots and fitness to be president were some of the issues raised, and for both candidates this was their last chance to face off against each other before Election Day on Nov. 8.
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and USC Annenberg’s Center of Communication Leadership and Policy co-hosted the event, which included a pre-debate and post-debate panel. The panel featured Nick Germain from USC College Democrats; Alan Arkatov, the Katzman/Ernst Chair for Educational Entrepreneurship, Technology and Innovation for USC Rossier School of Education; Mary Perez, the vice president of USC College Republicans; and Justin Wallin, chief operating officer and chief marketing officer at Probolsky Research. Moderators included Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, and Lily Vaughan, editorial director at the Daily Trojan. 
The crowd cheered as the final debate began and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton walked onto the stage, yet booed when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump walked onto the stage. 
Wallin said the debate would not change voters’ minds about who to vote for. 
“The election is set. The winner on this was really [moderator Chris] Wallace who I think did a remarkable job, and for once allowed for a sensitive talk about policies,” Wallin said. “If you listened, there were some distinct differences between the candidates, but I don’t think in terms of the election it did anything whatsoever.”
Germain discussed what he termed one of Clinton’s more memorable moments. 
“I believe the most memorable moment of the night was when Donald Trump leveraged an attack against Secretary Clinton that she had essentially accomplished nothing over her 30 years in public life, and she countered that with a decade-by-decade juxtaposition of what she was doing during that time and what Donald Trump was also embarrassingly doing at the same time,” Germain said. “I think that moment stuck with me and stuck with many voters at home.”
Perez argued that though Donald Trump didn’t strengthen his stance with voters, he managed to not hurt his position.
“He did an adequate job in remaining civil in comparison to the first two debates,” Perez said. “I think many people already knew who they were going to vote for and this debate didn’t change that.”

Condoms and tampons covered the tables and desks in the room. Samples were given to each person in the audience, which introduced the conversation of the panel. Stigma surrounds each of these objects, and panelists Margo Lang, co-founder of Conscious Period, and Claire Courtney, co-founder of Lovability Condoms, aimed to fight that stigma by initiating the conversation around sex and periods.
“Our mission is to break down stigmas around really important products, like condoms and tampons, that are health tools,” Courtney said. 
Courtney and Lang discussed how their businesses confronted the social stigmas surrounding sexuality and feminine products Wednesday evening at the Leventhal School of Accounting with moderator Safiya Nygaard from Buzzfeed’s Ladylike. 
Courtney started her company, Lovability Condoms, to break the stigma of using this form of birth control. People are still uncomfortable with using condoms, according to Courtney, and she wanted to empower women to feel comfortable carrying around a tool that is useful to their everyday life. 
Before starting the project, Courtney researched the issue of condom usage. When she found that a majority of the population is not comfortable with using condoms, she decided that technological advancements are required to remedy the situation.
“Every possible place is telling us that nobody likes to use condoms,” Courtney said. “So how do you create a community around something that people aren’t into? I think a huge part of that is innovation.” 
Courtney discussed how the perception people have around the pleasure, or lack thereof, of  condoms affects the consumption of the product, and technology will be able to correct any dissatisfaction with condoms. 
She discussed the history of the condom, which dates back to the ancient Egyptians. Despite the large amount of time since its invention, Courtney stresses how there hasn’t been much technological advancement in the product. For example, Courtney discovered in her research that some women find condoms uncomfortable, smelly and a hassle to dispose of. 
“We are working with the industry that we have and with the product that’s available right now to try to create a different conversation, market and talk about these products differently, and provide a space where condoms are positive,” Courtney said. 
Furthermore, Courtney said that purchasing condoms can be an embarrassing thing to do, and she wanted to make condoms more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to allow women to feel comfortable carrying them around. When starting the business, she struggled with getting businesses and boutiques to accept the possibility of selling condoms to their customers. 
Lang’s business, Conscious Period, also aims to bring positivity to a product that is attached to a negative connotation. Periods are a touchy subject to the public, Lang said, but she wants to shift the conversation to be more inclusive. Lang said women get upset when their periods begin again, but she sees it as an empowering experience and a sign of good health — even something to be celebrated.
“How can we change the conversation?” Lang said. “It’s so much about the product, but it’s also about how we feel about very natural experiences like sex and periods.”
Lang uses her product to bring up education on the subject of women’s health and hygiene. She said that she wants women to question what is in the health products they are using, and hopes that her organic tampons allow women to ask these questions and feel comfortable with using these products. 
Lang’s company not only influences the consumers, but also supports those in the community. Conscious Period sells tampons and uses part of the profit to give pads to women in the United States who are unable to afford feminine products. Government assistance programs do not cover tampons or pads, Lang said, and she wants to raise awareness of the necessity of these products that are taxed as “luxury items.” 
Betty Stearns, a senior majoring in aerospace engineering, called the talk “inspiring” and said that it changed the way she thought about the way gender is perceived in society. 
“I think a lot of these issues really affected me,” Stearns said. “How do I talk about periods, and how do I talk about sex as a woman? It’s very inspiring to know that there are people out there that are invoking this change and are leading this movement.”
Lang and Courtney said that they aim to create social change in the community with their products by introducing a conversation silenced by social stigmas.
“Any time you have a community that has been silenced, the real way to uplift them is by creating a space for their voice,” Courtney said. “It’s about us standing up for ourselves and our own desires.”
