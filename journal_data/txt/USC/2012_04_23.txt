The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident summary between Friday, April 20, and Sunday, April 22.
Crimes against a person
at 1:06 p.m. on April 22, a juvenile reported that another juvenile touched her buttocks with the palm of his hand while she was standing outside a restroom at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The second juvenile was detained for investigation, but after questioning him the officers concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a crime having been committed and he was released.
at 8:21 p.m. on April 21, a student reported that a suspect approached him on an MTA bus and forcibly pulled a chain from around his neck while he was standing at the rear door preparing to exit. When the door opened the suspect pushed the student off the bus and the suspect remained on board as it drove away.
at 5:02 p.m. on April 21, a non-USC female reported that a suspect touched her buttocks while she was standing in a crowd in front of a booth at the center of campus. The female did not report the incident at the time it occurred. DPS officers were unable to conduct a search for the suspect.
Crimes against property
at 10:45 a.m. on April 20, students and faculty members reported that a suspect has been sabotaging experiments in laboratories at Jerry and Nancy Neely Petroleum and Chemical Engineering Building for the past several months and the incidents have caused safety concerns.
at 8:53 a.m. on April 20, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect attempting to sell a bicycle near Jefferson Boulevard and Catalina Street and detained him for investigation. The bike was registered to a student, but the officers were unable to contact her to determine if a crime had occurred and the suspect was subsequently released. The bike was impounded at the DPS office until the student could claim it.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 3:43 p.m. on April 21, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect selling ice cream from a cart near Marks Tower and detained him for investigation. The officers confiscated the cart and the suspect was released after being advised against trespassing on university property. The owner of the cart was advised that he could claim it at the DPS office.
at 7:35 p.m. on April 20, DPS officers responded to a fourth floor fire alarm activation because of smoke in two operating rooms at the Keck Hospital of USC. No fire was found and the officers did not observe any smoke, but they detected the smell of burning rubber. FMS personnel were then requested to check the building but could not locate the source of the smell. The smell began to dissipate and the building was cleared for re-entry without further incident.
at 9:27 a.m. on April 20, a staff member in University Gardens reported that a suspect attempted to make unauthorized travel arrangements through her office via email under the name of another staff member. The reporting staff member did not process the request.
Not one 4:20 related crime!

The USC Board of Trustees formally voted to change the name of the USC School of Theatre to the USC School of Dramatic Arts on Friday. The decision was made so that the school’s name described all majors within the program.
An email sent by Madeline Puzo, the dean of the USC School of Theatre, said one of the reasons for the name change was because the new name better illustrates the reach and intentions of the school’s students.
“Ninety-seven [percent] of our students come to USC with the intention of working in the dramatic arts after graduation but only 12 [percent] intend to work in theatre alone,” Puzo said.
Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, said the new name matches the transforming field of dramatic arts.
“As increasingly diverse modes of performance and exhibition find expression in the dramatic arts, a broad range of new opportunities will emerge,” Garrett said in a statement. “In taking on a name that reflects the practice in a modern context, the USC School of Dramatic Arts firmly establishes itself at the forefront of this exciting transformation.”
Grace Ko, a freshman majoring in theatre, said the broader name change could entice more students to apply to the school.
“The USC School of Dramatic Arts is a more overarching name and incorporates more aspects than the USC School of Theatre,” Ko said. “Many students who want to work in the entertainment industries will probably want to apply to the school now, whereas they may have been deterred by the original name since it only included theatre.”
The name will officially change July 1.

The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at USC will hold two new programs this summer that offer high school students the opportunity to experience hands-on lab research in the biomedical sciences and to encourage them to pursue science after high school.

Early Investigator High School Summer Program in Stem Cell Research gives scientifically minded high school students from Harvard-Westlake School, the Marlborough School and the Lifeline Education Charter School the ability to experience eight weeks in a research laboratory.
The USC Science, Technology and Research High School Summer Research and Creativity program, which has a 23-year standing partnership with the Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School, will broaden into stem cell research with its $264,000 grant from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine.
These programs offer high school students eight weeks in the lab and a weeklong workshop at the beginning of the summer, during which students learn techniques for stem cell research. Participants also attend progress meetings and seminars, and are assigned regular lab duties.
“Expansion of the USC STAR summer research program is an exciting new chapter in our science education endeavors and partnership with Bravo High School,” said Dr. Roberta Diaz Brinton, director of the USC STAR program.
USC STAR will offer 10  high school students the opportunity to intern with a research team either at the Stem Cell Center or one of its 50 associate laboratories. All CIRM STAR interns will give a final research presentation and will aid in planning the Stem Cells, Creativity and the Public forum.
In the EiHS program, students will be placed with a mentor who will guide them through the research process. The program has accepted three students from Harvard-Westlake but is not sure how many applicants it will accept from Marlborough and Lifeline Education Charter School. Students are nominated by teachers and are required to fill out an application and attend an interview.
Dr. Victoria Fox, EiHS program director, said she started this program because of high school students’ interest in science.
“This is a research-run facility involved in training individuals from undergrads to professors,” Fox said. “Every year I got bombarded by high school students who wanted to come to my lab and gain experience.”
Fox said he hopes EiHS will give participants the opportunity to gain practical experience in a lab.
“The program will bring kids from all different backgrounds together through science and take kids from any school that are gifted and give them opportunity to work in a lab at a higher education level,” Fox said.
Brinton said this program is important for the USC STAR program and for the students who will gain from this new opportunity in science.
“The Broad Institute of Regenerative Medicine faculty mentorship of STAR students joins in the remarkable Trojan Family spirit of USC scientists who give so generously of their gifts and talents and who pay it forward,” Brinton said.
” …to encourage them to pursue science high after school.”
This is indeed the best way to pursue science.

The School of Cinematic Arts announced the creation of the Media Institute for Social Change, a non-profit organization that will focus on channeling the power and reach of film and television entertainment for positive social change, on Friday.
Michael Taylor, chair of film and television production, will lead the Media Institute of Social Change and said he encourages film students to write, direct and produce films that will advocate for social and political change.
The institute will provide scholarships to students integrating social change into their films, offer advice to professional filmmakers and conduct research on information in films about social change, Taylor said.
Taylor said the timing of the new institute is important because media continues to have a growing impact on society.
“There is an interest now more than ever before in social issues, and as filmmakers we have a huge impact on the culture,” Taylor said. “We have a huge impact so we can use those films for the greater good by incorporating issues of social change into the movies.”
He said he hopes to expand the mission of his class Making Media for Social Change, which he is co-teaching with Emmy Award-winning director Jeremy Kagan, into multiple facets of media.
“There are 14 students that I have in that class, and out of the 14 films that we’re making on various social issues, only one is a documentary, so 13 out of 14 are fictional films, and I think there is a tremendous interest now in doing that,” Taylor said.
The institute will research the effects current television and film have on public opinion and policy, Taylor said.
“The Media Institute for Social Change is rigorously nonpartisan,” Taylor said. “We do not have a political agenda; we are not taking a position on issues.”
The institute will also establish connections between industry professionals to faculty experts at USC to provide facts and guidance on topics, including social human rights and environmental justice.
“I went to a conference last week at the United Nations in New York and people were really very interested in what we were doing here at USC and how we’re using film and television and new media to incorporate social issues into the work that we’re doing on a variety of issues,” Taylor said.

Professor Wayne Glass said goodbye to 10 years of teaching international relations on Monday in The Forum with a lecture called “Looking Back to the Future,” highlighting important lessons from his past as well as advice for students in the present and future.
“I’ve sort of formulated a series of rules,” Glass said. “I really do think that some of the things I say, I hope you’ll take them with you.”
Retiring · Wayne Glass, a professor of international relations, delivered his last lecture at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Monday. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Glass came to USC in 2002, ending an extensive civil service career in Washington, D.C. that saw him holding positions with the State Department, Congressional Budget Office and as senior defense policy advisor to Senator Jeff Bingaman.
Despite his brief tenure, Glass quickly became a legend among students, making his mark as more than just another professor, said Chris Yon, a senior majoring in international relations (global business).
“He is the most influential professor I have ever known,” Yon said. “He is a true motivator. He really knows how to reach out to students.”
Glass’ first piece of advice was to “never pass up an opportunity.” He shared stories of how he came to learn this from getting a scholarship to Princeton University to getting his first job at the Pentagon to meeting his wife, and told students to apply this advice to their own education.
“USC is a special time and place in your life,” Glass said. “Don’t miss any opportunities. Discover what a great place USC is and take opportunities to see the world.”
Glass created a summer program that takes a delegation of students to Washington, D.C. to research nuclear security and meet with experts and officials to get experience in the field. Glass said he still plans to facilitate the program for as long as possible despite his retirement from the school.
Clara Purk, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she met Glass last summer through the Washington, D.C. program. She said part of the experience is spending a few weeks with Glass himself.
“He’s so comfortable and amazingly fun to be around,” Purk said. “He also just provides a lot of valuable insight into being in D.C. It’s one of the most unique experiences. He’s so positive and so giving.”
Glass also advised students to set and achieve high standards and acquire as much knowledge as possible but to also have a sense of humor in their work. He cited an experience with the Pentagon, when he gave a deputy secretary a speech titled “The Five Pint Program for Improving Defense Acquisition” instead of “The Five Point Program.”
“I saw the ‘Five Pint Program,’ and I thought to myself, ‘Now, I can fix it, but I don’t think the deputy secretary gets a good laugh, so I’m going to let it run and see what happens,’” Glass said. “The draft of the speech went up to the deputy secretary of defense and came back with corrections. One of them was to circle the pint and write, ‘Make mine Jack Daniels.’”
Looking to the future, Glass told students to aim for success, but it is more important to aim for happiness.
“Go to the beach and throw the crystal ball Frisbee that you won in one of my classes,” Glass said, referring to a simulation he conducts in class that allows students to predict who will win upcoming sporting events.
“Everyone gets to guess scores for sports. When you guess the score right, you get a prize. I won a calendar,” said Hanjun Chung, a junior majoring in international relations (global business). “The whole point was like in foreign policy, nothing is certain. You have to make those choices and try to guess based on the stats and history. [Glass] is really insightful about it.”
Glass cited networking as a major factor for much of his success in Washington, D.C., and said he utilizes Facebook to keep in touch with former students and help them make professional connections with other students. He encouraged current students to stay connected with him.
“I love postcards,” he said. “So I want you to stay in touch with me and send me postcards from the most obscure places you can find.”
I have known your “Dr. Glass” for 51 years! In fact, he was the first boy to ask me for a date!  I said yes.  We have been friends since.  To me, he’s just “Wayne”— smart, insightful, fun, committed, clever, great parent, and a teacher to-the-core.  Wayne has always been and will always be a “learner.” The best teachers are consummate learners.  
Best wishes to a dear friend.

The 18-5 win over Kazakhstan on Friday that propelled Hungary to the semifinals was enough for the team to earn a berth in the eight-team Olympic field.
Alumna Sofia Konoukh also helped Russia qualify Friday after a 7-6 victory over Canada, which also consisted of USC graduates Joelle Bekhazi and Rosanna Tomiuk.
Konoukh will appear in the Olympics for the fourth time in her career.
Another USC graduate, Ilse van der Meijden of the Netherlands, barely missed the cut after the Dutch fell 6-7 to Italy in the quarterfinals. Van der Meijden and the Netherlands won the gold in the 2008 Beijing Games.
Though Hungary and Russia fell in their semifinal matchups to Spain and Italy on Saturday, both teams will be joining Australia, China, Italy, Great Britain, Spain and the United States in London.
The United States Olympic water polo roster will be announced next month and could include USC seniors Lauren Wenger, Tumua Anae and Kami Craig.
The three were members of the national team that secured an Olympic berth after winning the Pan-American Games.
Bolonyai will return to USC to help the Women of Troy in the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament in USC’s attempt to qualify for the 2012 NCAA tournament in May.
The tournament begins Friday and will continue through Sunday.

As the 2012 football season rapidly approaches, I can only think about what kind of USC team will exit the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum tunnel Sept. 1.
Immense buzz is circulating the USC campus because of Heisman hopes and the possibility to play in a BCS bowl game.
It is undeniable that USC is one of the most talked about football programs heading into the 2012 season. Fresh off its two-year postseason ban, the Trojans would have the opportunity to return to their bowl dominance.

This return to glory is not something new to USC. Under coach John McKay, the USC football program thrived between 1960-1975. It wasn’t long before USC became known as “Tailback U,” after Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson won the Heisman Trophy in 1965 and 1968, respectively — in addition to the talent of Sam “Bam” Cunningham. Under McKay, USC won four national championships (1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974). McKay’s “Tailback U” moniker continued with other notable players, such as Anthony Davis, Ricky Bell, Charles White and Marcus Allen.
Decades later, players such as Reggie Bush, LenDale White, Joe McKnight and Stafon Johnson revived the title once again. USC continues to use multiple players in its backfield; however that backfield now has a new nickname.
ESPN analyst Brock Huard recently named USC “Quarterback U” because of the school’s recent prodigies. Though USC has consistently had great talent at the quarterback position, most have been overshadowed by the players of the “Tailback U” era. This becomes clear when looking at the list of USC’s seven Heisman Trophy winners, only two of which are quarterbacks.
Huard cites the success of Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez, the inaugural members of “Quarterback U.” Looking at the careers of these three athletes, the worthiness of this new nickname is hard to deny.
The accomplishments of each of the quarterbacks mentioned above alludes to the newfound dynasty at USC.
Carson Palmer, the 2002 Heisman Trophy winner, completed 309 of 489 passes for 3,942 yards and threw 33 touchdowns during his senior season. At the time of his departure, Palmer led the then-Pac-10 conference in passing yards (11,818) and racked up 72 career touchdown passes. An All-American, Palmer was drafted first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in 2003. Palmer spent seven seasons (2003-2010) with the Bengals and is now the starting quarterback for the Oakland Raiders.
Matt Leinart was the second quarterback to win the coveted Heisman Trophy and the first junior quarterback (2004). In Leinart’s career at USC, he finished with 807 completions of 1,245 attempts for 10,693 yards, and 99 touchdowns. Leinart surpassed Palmer for touchdown passes and completion percentage. He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals 10th overall in the 2006 draft. Since then, Leinart has been plagued with injuries thus unable to generate his professional career.
Mark Sanchez emerged as the next top USC quarterback for the Trojans following the departure of Sanchez’s predecessor John David Booty. In his junior season, Sanchez finished the season with 3,207 yards, 34 touchdowns and was the 2009 Rose Bowl MVP. Sanchez chose to forgo his senior season and entered into the 2009 draft. He was selected by the New York Jets fifth overall. At New York, Sanchez has led the Jets to the AFC championship for two consecutive years.
Aside from Palmer, Leinart, and Sanchez, another USC quarterback has generated quite a stir in the NFL. Matt Cassel was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL draft, after not starting one game for the Trojans. After briefly starting for the Patriots, Cassel was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2009. Cassel led the Chiefs to its first division title in seven years.
With Barkley entering his senior season, fans can only imagine what lies ahead. In his career thus far, Barkley has broken the single-game touchdown record three times and has earned numerous other accolades.
Also, USC has many rising quarterbacks in the ranks. With freshmen Max Wittek and Cody Kessler in the Trojans’ arsenal, “Quarterback U” will remain intact for years to come.
“Tailback U” is a thing of the past. 2012 marks the year of the quarterback.

They say baseball is a thinking man’s game. The USC baseball team sure has had a lot of time to think about its loss at the hands of UC Santa Barbara.
The Trojans (20-15) blew a three-run ninth-inning lead against the Gauchos last Wednesday before surrendering the winning run in the 12th.
Must win · The Trojans haven’t had much to celebrate this past week, as they are still getting over a 12-inning loss to UC Santa Barbara. USC faces Long Beach State on Tuesday with a chance to right the ship. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Since then they have had five days off, their longest stretch of the season. That’s five days to think about the disappointment of that loss and to prepare for tonight’s chance at redemption against Long Beach State.
“We’re excited to get back out there and avenge our loss from Santa Barbara,” said freshman pitcher Wyatt Strahan, who pitched two solid innings in relief against the Gauchos. “We didn’t play our best baseball. But we’ve had a week of solid practices and we’re ready.”
USC bested Long Beach (18-19) by a 4-2 score in both teams’ fourth game of the season. The Dirtbags have played 19 games against teams that have also played the Trojans, going 9-10 against those teams. The Trojans have played 14 games against Long Beach opponents, going 6-8 in these contests.
Tuesday’s game against the Dirtbags marks the start of a stretch-run of sorts for the Trojans. They have no more weekends off and will have a midweek game for four of the last five weeks of the season.
“We’ve talked about it a little bit,” said Strahan on the difficulty of the Trojans’ remaining schedule. “But we try to focus more on the single game; not get ahead of anything.”
The strength of their schedule doesn’t help either. Of the Trojans’ 20 remaining games, a full half come against teams currently ranked in the top 12. They have one against No. 7 Cal State Fullerton and three each against No. 10 Oregon, No. 11 Arizona and No. 12 UCLA. Four of USC’s last five Pac-12 conference series come against teams currently in the top half of the conference standings — the three ranked teams mentioned above, as well as 26-12 Oregon State, who the Trojans will host at Dedeaux this weekend.

Framed by a pink sky with tufts of dark pink clouds, a pink ice cream scoop with a single eye, a cone for a lower body and gray shoes stands aghast. Dark pink blood gushes from its head as a flying green creature with pink wings sinks its teeth into what could be seen as the cyclops-ice-cream-scoop’s head. Behind these two figures, a smaller flying creature drips with the remains of its latest victim who stands nearby with a white spot at the top of his head. A third figure sits on a giant scoop of ice cream and screams as another winged creature heads gleefully toward him.
Monster mash · Buff Monster makes his mark on the art world with latest exhibition Legend of the Living Cherry Tree. “Birth of a Zombie” (above) showcases Monster’s signature fantasy-meets-horror style and colorful aesthetic. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
Though it sounds like a scene out of a fantastical horror movie or some disturbed little kid’s mind, this scene actually plays out as an acrylic work on wood. “Birth of a Zombie,” — one of many works in artist Buff Monster’s current show, Legend of the Pink Cherry -— epitomizes the artist’s playful-yet-sinister style.
A seasoned artist who started placing posters around the streets of Los Angeles, Buff Monster’s acrylic-on-wood pieces can cause viewers to either cringe or laugh. The USC alumnus’ current show at the Corey Helford Gallery in Culver City allows visitors to take a journey in a cotton-candy-colored world of violence, danger and adorable ice-cream creatures that could make almost any art lover melt.
The bottom floor of the show continues with the pattern of gore and war-like scenes in a group of pieces that displays not only Buff Monster’s artistic dexterity, but also his complex creativity in rendering fantastical, vivid scenes. Inspired by Renaissance paintings, the works display the artist’s love of the color pink and ability to contrast cutesy creatures and precarious situations.
“The Triumph of Death” shows another poor creature running and screaming while his dead companion lies near him. A skeletal figure armed with arrows navigates an evil flying fiend up above. The piece showcases one very important facet of Buff Monster’s work — even when the composition is nearly entirely pink, there is variety. The landscape in the background of this piece features more ice cream scoops and even a cherry: Different shades of pink create complexity and three-dimensionality. Even the smallest of scoops possess their own texture.
Most of the pieces depict war-like, fantastical scenes, but “The Demon Tamer” simply shows a little cone figure petting a winged evil baby. The portrait has a Renaissance feel, with its simple rendering of a figure filling the whole frame. It resembles the image of any Renaissance man that might have asked to have his figure painted for his wall — except this one is dripping pink ice cream.
No matter the subject matter, all the pieces share Buff Monster’s attention to detail and flawless painting skills. The show marks the artist’s first time working with airbrush, and the technique effectively gives the pieces a sheen that makes them pop even more.
The exhibition continues upstairs in a slightly different vein, featuring a group of five-inch by seven-inch paintings Buff Monster collectively titled “The Melty Misfits.” The 60 works act as trading cards and came to fruition because of Buff Monster’s love for Garbage Pail Kid cards.
Impressively, each card contains the same amount of attention as the artist’s larger works. The pink color scheme continues and the same ice cream creatures take on a variety of emotions. The upstairs portion also includes studies of a selection of Buff Monster’s pieces to give the viewer a sneak peek at the artist’s creative process.
Equal parts fun, horror, fantasy and something uncategorizable and uniquely Buff Monster, the pieces in Legend of the Pink Cherry make a case for both the artist’s talent and the possibilities for art-making. Whether on a wood canvas or the small dimensions of a trading card, the artist’s works blend familiar scenes in art history with a unique sense of humor. Hopefully, no scoops of ice cream were hurt in the process.

Three and a half months ago, my first tack in trying to come up with a name for this column involved attempting to riff off some of television’s more colorful nicknames. Dispiriting as it was to discard a slew of admittedly horrible ideas, it wasn’t nearly as disheartening as the realization of what some of TV’s most ingrained nicknames  — boob tube, idiot box, etc. — seemed to have in common:
None of them were terribly flattering.
Speaking poorly of television is nothing new, but it’s indicative of a broader perception of the entire medium as a guilty pleasure, not just specific shows. Most of us have a program or two that we don’t readily confess to watching, but the fact of the matter is we’re conditioned from very early on to regard television on the whole as one big indulgence, the consumption of which should universally inspire guilt.
Not having cable is sometimes looked at as a marker of intelligence, as if only greater minds are capable of making the radical decision to abstain from the acknowledged brain-rotter that is TV; it’s seen as a badge of honor to go without.
But those who elect to forgo other outlets of entertainment are hardly regarded with comparable reverence. Learning that someone refuses to access the Internet would only draw perplexed stares, just as discovering that someone doesn’t go to the movies on principle would almost certainly inspire pity.
So why is television almost uniquely lavished with disdain, and its devotees shamed within an inch of their lives? There’s no good explanation, but it could stem from the fact that most people’s early interactions with TV are a study in excess. Children, not yet instructed that all good things are best in moderation, are wont to overindulge. (For whatever reason, binge-watching Hey Arnold! as a child will cost you your TV privileges for a week, but binge-watching Breaking Bad as a college student will simply cost you your weekend.)
Early relationships with television tend to get off to a rocky start. They can be unhealthy, abusive or emotionally unfulfilling. But once you’re able to cultivate a mature relationship with TV, it’s hard to remember why anyone ever painted it as a bad thing. The pros grow more numerous, as the cons fall away.
Thankfully, the tide has begun to turn in television’s favor in recent years. The phrase “new Golden Age of television” is now regularly bandied about. Some of the film industry’s finest talents are either returning to or foraying into small screen projects.
The cover of Vanity Fair’s May issue bears the provocation “Admit it… You love TV more than movies.” Los Angeles Times film critic Mark Olsen even felt compelled to write “a defense of movies” in response for Sunday’s Calendar section.
Many of today’s premium cable options, basic cable and even some broadcast networks are as good as anything that’s ever been produced for the small screen.
Today’s best dramas are as beautifully wrought as any form of storytelling could reasonably aspire to, while today’s best comedies are quick, quirky, offbeat and genuinely funny.
Today, a TV habit isn’t merely defensible, it’s sensible: Why on Earth wouldn’t you be watching Mad Men? Can you really justify not catching up on Friday Night Lights when the whole series is on Netflix Instant? Will you be able to live with yourself if Community is canceled because you couldn’t be bothered to tune in for half an hour once a week?
That’s not to say that watching television should ever turn into an obligation. We’ll know for sure that TV has really made it once a new strain of sneering TV snobs emerges to look down on anyone not familiar with the haughty micro-dramas of Downton Abbey. Insufferable superciliousness, now almost exclusively the province of cinephiles, is on its way to the world of television, you can count on it.
Keep in mind, television is a populist medium. Though it is not ‘by’ the people, it’s most certainly ‘for’ the people. TV viewers have more choices than ever before, and every show on television is fighting tooth and nail for your attention.
As an audience member, you are king or queen, and there’s nothing whatsoever to keep you from getting drunk with power. Sample as many shows as you can; give them a few episodes to reel you in (or don’t); watch on any — legal — platform you please (that’s my future livelihood, after all).
More than anything, make sure to wear your fandom with pride. There are no good or bad shows, only shows that you like and shows that you don’t. Whatever you watch, remember that you are a de facto person of taste — personal taste.

Though the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County sits across the street from the USC campus, its presence often goes unrecognized by students. Why? The reason isn’t particularly clear, though it could be attributed to a lack of awareness, a facade that doesn’t impress passers-by or simply underdeveloped interest in the museum’s offerings.
Field trip · Students from the Ambassador School of Global Education admire the Natural History Museum’s new Home Garden, which features a variety of vegetables and herbs and acts as a space for educational purposes. - Eddie Kim | Daily Trojan
But with the Natural History Museum plunging forth into its next-generation improvement initiatives, however, it’s becoming clear that the landmark is more than a place to visit for anthropology extra credit. In light of the museum’s looming 2013 centennial, the team behind the project has ambitiously stepped up the game with a series of impressive developments in an outdoor area dubbed the “North Campus,” parts of which opened for limited prototype use on Thursday.
The good news? There’s enough here to perk up the attention of any Angeleno.
“What we’ve done here is turn 3 1/2 acres of hardscape — asphalt and parking lots — into living, breathing nature,” Jane Pisano, president and director of the museum, said about the North Campus.
And she’s not exaggerating, either. The new area is an impressive landscape of carefully chosen plants, natural features and recreational areas that adds a whole new dimension to the museum experience while taking advantage of a formerly unsightly expanse of asphalt.
Several distinct areas comprise the North Campus project, and highlights include the Home Garden, which offers visitors a showcase of fruit trees and garden vegetables and plants; the Transition Garden, which acts as a living history of the Los Angeles landscape; and a pond, which presents an aquatic environment to study various non-native creatures.
“We went wild,” Mia Lehrer, the president of landscape architecture firm Mia Lehrer + Associates, said with a Cheshire-cat grin.
Case in point: Even the most mundane of features sport fresh, innovative approaches. The museum refers to the retaining wall along the entrance, for instance, as a “Living Wall,” built from rough-hewn rock to support plants and insects within its cracks. The stream that emanates from the aforementioned pond acts as a metaphor for Los Angeles’ own water systems, with a flow that disappears below ground and a section that can dry up in warmer weather.
Even the ground is unique: Instead of the usual concrete foundation, the museum chose decomposed granite, which allows rainwater to drain into underground aquifers but also flaunts a heftier price tag and requires diligent upkeep.
More than anything, North Campus aims to encourage biodiversity and to craft an urban habitat for the many intriguing species, both native and exotic, that call Los Angeles home. Karen Wise, the Natural History Museum’s vice president and leader of the North Campus project team, noted that the project not only offers relevant science for Angelenos to utilize in understanding their environment, but also some incredible insight into the abundant biodiversity of the city.
“We can have a new kind of experience: a public field site as part of an institution, a place where we together — and not just we scientists and educators but we Angelenos — can understand, [for instance], why there are so many birds in Los Angeles,” Wise said. “This is the ‘birdiest’ county in the nation. What? Why is that?”
Herpetologist Greg Pauly put the creation of an urban oasis for wildlife in a slightly a different way: “Build it, and they will come,” he said, cheekily quoting Field of Dreams.
Pauly might as well have been referring to people, too: It’ll be hard to resist features like the centerpiece of the North Campus, the sparkling Otis Booth Pavillion — a massive structure of glass and steel that will act as the museum’s official entrance. There’s also a gleaming, arcing pedestrian bridge that invites visitors into the museum, and it’s no coincidence that all these new developments face Exposition Boulevard, according to project supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.
“All those folks moving east and west on the Expo light rain line will know that [the North Campus] is a complementary piece to the tourism and attractions that make this part of Los Angeles County so exceptional,” Thomas said.
The North Campus project is part of NHM Next, an initiative to aggressively refresh the museum’s content and presentation that largely began in 2006 with indoor renovations.
The initiative, funded in part by the County of Los Angeles and the California Department of Parks of Recreation on top of private donors, has to date raised $105 million of its staggering $135-million goal. Though it’s literally a large price to pay to upgrade the museum, Wise believes it’s a game-changing move that will revolutionize the museum experience.
“You won’t just see the mammals that were alive 65 million years ago — you’ll also see their descendents right outside,” Wise said. “You see the science that’s manifest in the [indoor] exhibits, but it always feels a little static. Out here, the science is always going on, and we’re sharing it. Real science, real time, together.”
Wise pointed out that this is an unprecedented project, one that looks to make the Natural History Museum unlike any other institution of its kind in the nation.
It’s probably a blessing, then, that it’s right across the street.

Generation Y Americans say they are open to the idea of an office romance because it means improved performance and increased morale.
A survey conducted in January by the employee support services company Workplace Options and Public Policy Polling found that 84 percent of employees aged 18 to 29 say they would date a co-worker.
Another 71 percent think that workplace romance is a positive thing that improves performance and morale.
Older generations, however, disagree — only 29 percent of those aged 46 to 65 say they would consider dating someone they worked with. 90 percent of that same age group say it could harm the workplace rather than help it.
Generational differences in opinion exist, but at the end of the day, workplace relationships blur the line between personal and professional lives — something that ultimately does more harm than good.
Jean Baur, career coach and author of Job Interview Answers that Work, said in a Fox News article that Gen Y members have a different perspective on workplace romance for a reason.  In the past, striking a romantic relationship with a co-worker was seen as too risky. People were afraid to lose their jobs.
Younger people aren’t quite as risk-averse. “Millennials are less committed to staying with a company because they are early in their career,” Baur said. “They think, ‘If something happens, oh well, I can find another job.’”
The ease and informality of social media that dominates our generation’s behavior also make it easier and seemingly more acceptable to get to know co-workers outside the office.
We should be careful. Many corporations have strict no-dating policies that make dating a co-worker a firing offense.
Even at companies where dating a colleague is considered acceptable, it can still mean big trouble in terms of lawsuits and settlements if a relationship doesn’t end well. And for relationships between an employee and his or her superior, a skewed power-equation could lead to allegations of favoritism by colleagues and could impact his or her credibility. Not to mention, there is always the awkwardness of having to deal with an ex on a regular basis if the relationship doesn’t work out.
Although problems relating to workplace relationships are not an everyday occurrence, they can happen and will often have a negative, rather than positive, impact. A professional working environment, efficient team working and employee performance are all at stake when our personal and professional lives merge.
With the overwhelming popularity and increasing use of social media in the last five years, certain communication barriers and previously rigid social divisions in the workplace have been turned on their head. Social media also makes it harder for management to regulate office relationships. This is the reality of the digital world that Gen Y lives and works in. Thus, we must remember to keep our personal, online lives from negatively impacting our academic and professional ones.

This semester, I dedicated hours every week — in lectures, labs and observation hours — to a class completely and utterly unrelated to my major. I spent precious time, money and energy on The Universe (ASTR 100) to satisfy one of my General Education requirements that I need to graduate — not with a science or math degree, but with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a minor in journalism.
Does this situation really make sense?
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Needless to say, many students have a bone to pick with the General Education requirements. Frustrations run high when students who are already pressed for time and money are forced to take classes that have next to nothing to do with their majors.
The goals of the General Education program are commendable and should be preserved. But it’s time for the program to actually complement the goals of the students that it is meant to serve.
The university should tailor General Education requirements to students’ majors. A re-envisioning of the requirements would show a better understanding of the reality of student life, both before and after graduation.
Writing and math are two forms of communication fundamental to almost every career. We are all required to take writing classes that relate to our chosen disciplines. Why shouldn’t math be treated the same way?
As a Spanish and journalism student, I won’t use what I learned in astronomy after graduation. But what if all journalism students were required to take a statistics class? Journalists need to be able to understand and analyze numbers so they can better communicate the meaning of a study — or any math-related topic — to an audience that might not know statistics.
For majors even further removed from the math and science sphere, such as theatre or fine arts, an introductory accounting or finance course should be required. A basic understanding of finances would prove invaluable for any major after graduation, especially if that major isn’t known for being financially practical.
General Education requirements should include major-specific requirements that complement students’ areas of study. They shouldn’t be mere distractions to the completion of a major.
The General Education Program web page boasts five principal goals that revolve around helping students become well-rounded, well-educated persons armed with a wide range of skills and knowledge. But the program’s last goal, “To encourage a passion for learning,” is the most important. Currently, the program is not fulfilling this goal. I would love to be passionate about astronomy, but I can’t be when I think about the Spanish and journalism classes I could be taking instead.
This shouldn’t be another problem students gripe about year in and year out. Our four years at USC go quickly, and our time here shouldn’t be wasted.
 
Elena Kadvany is a senior majoring in Spanish.
Elena, as you said in your article, you are a journalism minor, which clearly means you have an interest in journalism. The General Education program makes you a more well rounded student and person, it will probably help you if you decide to pursue a career in journalism. You will have a better understanding of more topics and will be able to write about things that some other people may not be able to write about. I don’t know what you want to pursue but I think that you need to be open minded about things. I have read a few of your other articles and it seems like you have your mind set and you aren’t open to other opinions. Look at all of the different sides of an issue. Not just one.
The people who make the world go round–space shuttles that fly into space; physicians who perform organ transplants; computer science engineers who develop ubiquitious goods like i-products; electrical engineers who use electromagnetic energy to convert them to mechanical–make the world an easier place to live in. Sure, gen-ed classes can lead one to discover new avenues/approaches to thinking. But focusing on STEM disciplines is far more important than frivolous gen-ed classes. Gen-ed classes are “required” so that ultra-intelligent people, like yours truly, don’t become “callous automatons.” I use the allegory of “Karate Kid” when Mr. Miyagi adamantly instructed Daniel-san to perform wax-on, wax-off…You will see the big picture of your rigorgous STEM major after you overcome the abstract grasp/analyzation/algorithms in them. Bullshyt degrees are insignificant, and hence they should be on a pass/no pass basis….utterly worthless.
Elena, though the selection of courses within the GE program can be open to revision, I think your approach to course selection is very much to blame as well. Most students ask around for the easiest GE courses and take them just to get their requirements over with. However, that is not the purpose of the program. I think many of the gripes people have can be alleviated by careful course selection. If the ASTR course is not of interest to you, simply don’t take it and select something that you are actually interested in and may gain knowledge and insight from. Higher education is about learning, not about the final letter grade on your transcript.
The USC 2011 Undergrad salutatorian graduated with a double major: music performance–oboe and cell biology.  She discovered that class while fulfilling a general ed requirement.  While undergrads journey on that trek for a passion for learning, one never knows what you will discover.  Perhaps for you, astronomy was not it but you never know sometime in your future life when what you learned in that class, just might come to some use in your life.
Elena — I bet Steve Jobs had the exact same thoughts when he took calligraphy in college.
You’re negating the fact that Steve Wozniack, a CSCI major, laid the foundation for Apple’s inception. Hardware & software development cannot ensue because of some bullshyt, new-age thinking, artsy endeavor–caligraphy. “Creativity” is overrated; the Bible is “creative” when it explains the inception of the creation of the universe.
The goal of the General Education program is to expand your horizons. As a USC undergrad I’m glad USC gives us the chance to take classes that are utterly different from my major. Going to college, despite what most people think, is not about getting a job. It’s about becoming an educated and well-rounded individual. While the GenEd program has its shortcomings for sure, developing critical thinking skills in fields not immediately associated with your major will not only prove a worthwhile experience, but you will without a doubt find that your job requires you to think outside the box.

The No. 4-ranked USC women’s tennis team pulled off a huge upset Friday defeating top-ranked UCLA 6-1 in Westwood.
After falling to the Lady Bruins twice earlier this season, the Women of Troy had revenge on their mind as well as a chance to claim the Pac-12 title from the grasp of their heated crosstown rivals.
For the Women of Troy, the difference in this match was their ability to get ahead quickly as they picked up the doubles’ point to race out to a rare 1-0 lead.
Sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshman Sabrina Santamaria have struggled in doubles of late, despite sitting at No. 7 nationally. Against the Bruins, though, the duo showed their worth by closing out the doubles point by defeating the No. 11-ranked pair of Robin Anderson and Skylar Morton 8-6 in a tightly-contested match on court one.
Supplementing the Christian/Santamaria win was the performance by junior Danielle Lao and senior Alison Ramos. In her last regular season match, Ramos along with Lao opened up doubles with an exciting 8-6 victory over Jones/Seguso on court three. This match became especially important when the tram of juniro Valeria Pulido and freshman Zoe Scandalis fell to the 9th-ranked squad of Dolehide/Montez 8-6 in the second slot.
In singles, the Women of Troy stuck to their usually game plan as Santamaria and Christian did not disappoint in their respective matches. Usually the two to get USC started on the right foot at the beginning of singles’ play, the players each took home victories to put the Women of Troy up 3-0 before UCLA could blink.
Santamaria, now No. 29 in the country, easily defeated the Bruins’ Pamela Montez 6-2, 6-1, while Christian, who sits at No. 75, also notched a win on court four taking down Skylar Morton 6-4, 6-3.
On the heels of the two wins on courts three and four, Scandalis came up with a massive victory over the higher ranked Robin Anderson to put away the Bruins for good. Anderson, who came in No. 3 in the country, lost the first set 6-2, but came back strong int he second set only to lose in a heated game 7-5. Scandalis has had difficulty in the top singles spot of late and this win gives her added confidence and a big momentum boost heading into postseason play.
Once the match was decided, Lao and Valeria Pulido each would pick up a win against the Lady Bruins. The 18th-ranked junior had a tough day holding off UCLA’s McCall Jones, but she ended up picking up her 26th victory on the season after a 7-6 (1), 6-3 win.
The Women of Troy are surely to move up in the ITA rankings now that they can call themselves Pac-12 champions. While this is a huge emotional victory for the Women of Troy, there is still a ton of work to be done as they have their eyes set on bringing home a national championship back to Los Angeles.
