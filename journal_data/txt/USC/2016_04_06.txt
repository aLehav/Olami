The USC Young Scientist Program held a computer science and robotics workshop Wednesday afternoon at the 32nd Street School. The event was a joint effort between the Joint Education Project, YSP and the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and was sponsored by the Winn family and Union Bank. The workshop included three stations designed to teach the nearly 50 fourth and fifth graders in attendance basic coding and robotics skills.
Directed by Dieuwertje Kast, the STEM program manager at JEP and a USC alumna, about 10 USC students volunteering with JEP helped teach elementary school students about computer science and robotics, fields that senior physics and computer science major Michael Qian sees as vital to their success today.
“Especially today, you can go into any field and knowing a little something about computers and how they work is somehow going to help you,” Qian said. “I think being able to have kids start learning at a younger age how computers work on the inside, how programming, how coding works … that’s definitely going to help them later on.”
The 32nd Street School is one of five in the “USC Family of Schools” that works with YSP to engage more than 1,400 elementary school students in hands-on STEM education. These workshops aim to pique students’ interests in the field, and previous workshop topics have included underwater robotics, sustainability and fitness. YSP workshops often include guests working in the industry, such as USC alumnae Logan (’07, ’11) and Blade Olson (’11), who attended the event Wednesday as a robotics design representatives from Disney Consumer Products and Interactive.
“We’re essentially here to make sure these kids learn something cool about robotics and answer any questions they have about what we do or how we use coding or robotics in our jobs,” Logan Olson said. “But I think it’s most important that these kids have a lot of fun.”
The 50 kids present, all of whom were selected through an application process by their interest, each chose one of three stations: basic coding using an interface called Scratch, making cardboard robots called Recyclobots that students could control with hand-drawn remotes or programming toothbrush robots called Bristlebots to paint and draw. With these activities and special guests, Kast said that she hoped participants learned some valuable lessons.
“What I hope they take away from today is an appreciation for what computer science currently does for them, but also that they can get the skills to be able to do this themselves and potentially get a job in the field in the future,” Kast said.
Fifth graders Michelle Naranjo and Pedro Rojas seemed to have no trouble understanding the possibilities which computer science and robotics can provide. As they worked meticulously on their cardboard Recyclobots, trying to make the best one to win a “swag bag” donated by Disney, they discussed their interest in robotics and engineering.
“I love robotics, and computer science and anything having to do with it,” Naranjo said. “I also came because there’s less women doing engineering and I want to help it.”
Rojas echoed Naranjo’s enthusiasm, highlighting the infinite creative possibilities that robotics allows.
“What inspired me to enter robotics is that there is a lot of engineering in it, a lot of coding, a lot of building — everything,“ Rojas said. “Whatever pops into my mind, I can just create it and that’s why I like robotics.”

The USC Mentoring Awards recognized professors in departments across the University Wednesday evening in the University Club.
The awards program hopes to promote mentoring as “part of the culture” of the University and a fundamental tool for academic success, according to the awards website.
Started in 2005, the awards have been given to nearly 300 faculty for their mentoring efforts in the university community. Each year, 21 faculty are chosen “through a rigorous and competitive nomination and selection process,” according to the award program.
Out of more than 150 nominations for faculty mentoring awards, 21 were chosen. Twelve faculty members reviewed letters from students and fellow faculty members from across the University. Edward Finegan, director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Master of Ceremonies for the event, had words of commendation for nominees.
“It is humbling to come face to face with an extraordinary group of colleagues,” Finegan said.
Finegan also spoke about the three essential themes he found in the recommendation letters and which he believes lead to effective mentoring.
“The first [theme] had to do with caring. The mentees and the mentors frequently talked about how much mentors who are important in their lives had cared about them,” Finegan said. “Another is generosity, how much time they gave, how much dedication they gave, and how available they made themselves to their mentees. The third [theme] is the care that mentors take in cultivating writing amongst their mentees.”
Provost Michael Quick also spoke, discussing the power of mentoring in a university environment.
“I am speaking to the choir,” Quick said. “Everyone in this room understands the importance of mentoring. We are only going to be the kind of university we aspire to be by having the great networks of people who understand how to get ahead, how to be the best scholars we can be, and that only happens because we have great role models. Nobody does this stuff alone.”
Quick continued by saying that the individual attention and little moments of encouragement given by mentors in attendance has a major impact on students.
“You can have all of the formal mentoring in the world, but in the end, we forget how much that one comment at the right time can have all the difference in the world,” Quick said.
As the awards were presented to the 21 faculty recipients, Finegan repeated the points made in their recommendation letters. The letters expressed the important role faculty members played in the lives of the students and fellow faculty members who wrote the recommendations.
“All those who took care to write letters, all those cared enough about their colleagues or their teachers to sit down and write letters explaining how much those mentors had meant to them,” Finegan said. “That’s a very humbling experience, and one I think we all can very much enjoy.”
Of the faculty honored, seven staff members were from the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, five were from the USC Keck School of Medicine, four from the Viterbi School of Engineering and one faculty member each was selected from the Thornton School of Music, Ostrow School of Dentistry, Price School of Public Policy, School of Cinematic Arts, School of Architecture and Marshall School of Business.

Jeff Nygaard did not always know that he would make a career out of volleyball. Named the head coach of the men’s volleyball program this past summer after five seasons as an assistant coach on former head coach Bill Ferguson’s staff, Nygaard did not grow up obsessing over the game. In fact, he only began to play volleyball in the fall of his freshman year of high school because his basketball coach required each member of the team to play another sport in the fall.
“I was too tall for track, and I didn’t like football,” Nygaard, 6-foot-8, said. “So I played volleyball.”
It turned out to be a good decision. Nygaard, who wound up winning three Olympic medals and two collegiate MVP awards in a long and successful career, quickly led his Robert M. La Follette High School squad to two state championships. Needless to say, Nygaard attracted attention from some volleyball powerhouses, including UCLA.
He accepted the Bruins’ scholarship. It was just large enough that he could afford out-of-state tuition for one year. Nygaard admitted he did not know if he would be able to stay at UCLA for more than a year because finances were an issue. He was just grateful for the opportunity to play volleyball one more year, and he hustled on the court to increase his scholarship.
“There was volleyball and school,” Nygaard said. “I wasn’t [at UCLA] to waste my family’s money.”
The ’92 season went by and Nygaard improved enough to boost his sophomore scholarship. In ’93, he was co-Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament on the Bruins’ National Championship team. In ’94 and ’95, he repeated as National Player of the Year and in his senior year led UCLA to a 31-1 record and another National Championship. He finished second all-time at UCLA in kills (1,800) and blocks (658), fourth in aces (123) and 10th in digs (571). He is also first all-time in blocking average (1.88), second in kills per game (5.14) and third in kill percentage (.427).
Nygaard attributes his collegiate success to his playing at the highest levels internationally. In 1991, he tried out for the Men’s Junior National Team and was cut within the first hour, but he improved so much that two years later, he showed up and was told he already had a spot on the team. After playing abroad with the juniors, Nygaard practiced with the National B Team.
“The B Team was on one half of the gym and a curtain separated the A Team on the other half, and we were always looking over to see what they were doing,” Nygaard said. “One day someone got hurt or quit or something, and they walked over to our side and pointed at me and said, ‘You, come on, we need a middle.’”
Thus began Nygaard’s eight-year career on the men’s national team, which included the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Nygaard remembers exactly when he realized he could make a career out of volleyball. It was during his first tournament with the national team: the 1994 World Championships in Greece, where the team played 11 matches in 13 days.
“It was game five versus Cuba that I finally broke through to that other side,” Nygaard said. “From that moment forward, my game blossomed.”
Nygaard — just 22 at the time — was still awestruck by his teammates. He didn’t talk much, but as he was leaving the airport after the tournament, he received an unexpected compliment.
“[USC Hall of Famer] Bryan Ivie of all people turned to me and said, ‘Hey Nygaard. Good job,’” Nygaard said. “Having Ivie — who I still think is the greatest player I’ve ever played with — tell me that let me know that I earned the right to compete at the next level.”
In 1996, when Nygaard was in his prime, USA men’s volleyball finished a disappointing ninth, failing to qualify for the quarterfinals from Group A. In 2000, Nygaard had all kinds of ailments and only played one point for a US team that went 0-5 and tied for last with Egypt.
“The non-glorified reality of [Sydney] is I had mono, jaundice, strep, fever, night sweats,” Nygaard said. “I was a mess. I got quarantined. [All] I needed was a Z-Pak — which is a steroid — so I couldn’t take it. I just kept getting more and more symptoms. I couldn’t eat for four days. [The doctors] tried to give me an IV, but I was so dehydrated they couldn’t find a vein. Yet, I was still practicing.”
After Sydney, Nygaard had reached a fork in his career path. He was 28 — old for volleyball — and was not getting as much playing time. Furthermore, he had lost so much of his love of volleyball. In a word, he said he was “depressed.”
And then his head coach Doug Beal called him into his office.
“Thanks for your years, but you’re done here,” Beal said.
The news devastated Nygaard, but it helped him move forward and toward the next phase.
Nygaard moved back to California to contemplate an advanced degree and to transition into beach volleyball on the Association of Volleyball Professionals’ circuit.
“Life was volleyball, volleyball, volleyball,” Nygaard said. “Not that I was fanatical about it. That’s just who I was. Beach opened up the fact that I actually loved playing again. I liked competing and training.”
In his second year in the AVP, Nygaard won his first tournament — the 2002 Hermosa Beach Open — and was “hooked.” He became one of just three players since 1986 to win a title in one of his first 10 events.
In 2003, he won an AVP-high three events, took in the most prize money and won AVP Most Valuable Player. He teamed up with gold-medalist Dain Blanton who had approached him about winning gold in Athens in 2004. Together they won AVP Team of the Year and two tournaments internationally (in the FIVB), but fell short of the podium in Greece (finishing 19th).
“Of the three Olympics, that was the hardest one to earn,” Nygaard said. “It was an about-face, and I had to go all-in to make it.”
Athens may have been the toughest, but all three Olympic experiences were special for Nygaard.
“In 1996, we lost and our hearts were broken,” Nygaard said. “Some of the veterans put the loss [in perspective], and I realized realistically there are worse things. Two-thousand wasn’t storybook, but I obtained that goal [of making the team]. After 2004, it was way easier for me to detach [because of all I had learned].”
Nygaard continued playing in the AVP through 2010, racking up more wins in 2004, 2005 and 2009. His seven career wins rank him 50th all-time. Around the same time, shoulder problems were holding him back and he was about ready to step away from the game as a player. So he considered coaching.
“The longer you play, the more you end up mentoring the younger guys,” Nygaard said. “Then you just put yourself in those situations where you do end up coaching more and more. As you get older, the pool of the older wiser guys gets smaller and smaller. Eventually, you’re just it.”
Nygaard had a lifetime of volleyball wherewithal and wanted to “give it its due.”
“I had to try [coaching] for at least two or three years to see if I took to it,” Nygaard said. “I also saw far too many of my contemporaries finish volleyball and have nothing. I vowed to not be one of those guys. I had too many responsibilities — a mortgage, a wife, a kid — I was not about to just quit playing volleyball and have nothing.”
The AVP was going bankrupt, Nygaard’s body was breaking down, and he was looking to coach — but he had no coaching experience. But perfect timing enabled Nygaard to wind up at USC as an assistant to Bill Ferguson.
“I told Bill if someone was to offer me a job here and now, I would take it without a second’s hesitation,” Nygaard said.
Indeed, Ferguson gave him an interview and subsequently the job. Hence began Nygaard’s sojourn into coaching.
Nygaard has only played volleyball five times since he retired. He doesn’t miss it.
“I’ve mentally decided not to do it,” Nygaard said. “I’ve got three kids and a wife and a demanding job. I don’t see very many windows for me to compete and have fun, nor do I make those opportunities available. There is laundry to do, food to be cooked, dishes to be cleaned, the yard to mow and recruiting opportunities. I’m all in with this.”
The people he has met and his accomplishments throughout his career is enveloped in his coaching methodology.
“I think I am a collaboration and collection of everyone who taught me the game,” Nygaard said. “Even if the coach was terrible, that guy still somehow taught me patience.”
Nygaard also has quotes from Doc Rivers and John Wooden hanging in his office, but his main role model was UCLA Hall of Famer Al Scates.
“Scates didn’t deal in emotions,” Nygaard said. “He just expected you to compete.”
Nygaard’s style is similar: “dry and point blank.” If something needs to get done in practice or in game, Nygaard tells it to his players straight. He expects accountability and communication from his players and wants to foster those values in the volleyball program.
This season, his first at the helm, both accountability and communication have been operating “around 10 percent” of what he wants to build in his program.
“This year, we’ve simplified a lot of the messages and made them digestible,” Nygaard said. “Now, we’re competing at an acceptable level.”
As a first-year head coach, Nygaard’s thinking about his team and his program has had to change a lot throughout the course of the year. USC started ranked No. 12 nationally but quickly exited the NCAA poll for the first time since 2013. The rest of the year has been rockier. The team has two matches remaining at No. 1 BYU and a 7-17, 5-15 MPSF record to date. No one expected the Trojans to perform this poorly, and the swing of emotions has certainly made an impact on the head coach.
“I don’t think I’ve grown more in a year in my life, or experienced the human condition — the spectrum of emotion, feelings and experiences — on such a deep level every single way that I could imagine,” Nygaard said. “I can take one look at most of the guys on the team and know exactly where they are.”
He acknowledges that his style is different than Ferguson’s, and because of that, the program is in transition. However, by implementing a culture that “sustains accountability and communication,” Nygaard wants to recreate national championships for USC — a school with a tremendous volleyball legacy, including four national titles, but none since 1990.
“USC demands excellence [and] I have always expected to win every match of my career,” Nygaard said. “I do believe that we can recreate a winning culture here. There’s momentum, energy, untapped potential.”
In doing so, Nygaard would be adding to the long and storied legacy of USC athletics.
“There’s a long path ahead of us,” Nygaard said, before pointing at a “Fight On!” lettering hanging over his head on his office wall. “But with the powers that be at ’SC, it’s definitely possible.”
Ask him why he didn’t recruit better players the last couple of years essentially? He has been on the staff now for six seasons.
You get rid of previous coach Ferguson to retain his top asst. which continues any problems that supposedly existed. Micah C. and Robert Feathers were five years ago, and Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli were even further back. Now the program has reached bottom. Going to finish 5 – 17 in conference which is a disgrace!

The men’s volleyball team (7-17, 5-15 MPSF) will conclude their regular season this Friday and Saturday as they head to Utah to face No. 1 BYU (21-3, 17-3 MPSF), which is coming off two wins over then-No. 1 UCLA on the road last Friday and Saturday.
The Trojans are coming off of a split weekend at home. Last Friday night, USC swept UC San Diego (25-20, 25-17, 25-13) but lost to No. 15 UC Irvine in straight sets (21-25, 15-25, 23-25).
Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the Trojans with 17 kills on the weekend. Senior middle blocker Josh Kirchner was second on the team with 13 kills.
Going to BYU is always unpredictable for the Trojans. When the two schools meet, just like with USC and Hawaii, the teams play back-to-back matches.
“[Traveling is] a learning experience for the younger guys,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “It’s a great chance to educate them on what it takes to go on that trip and play in that environment.”
Playing at BYU is a challenge all of its own. Provo, Utah is just above 4,500 feet in elevation. Los Angeles is just over 200 feet in elevation. The difference in elevation alone is a difficult adjustment for teams to make, not to mention the fact that BYU is a mecca for men’s volleyball.
“It’s hostile in that it’s an extremely favorable BYU crowd,” Nygaard said.
“Favorable” would be an understatement. In their 10 home matches this season, BYU has averaged about 4,000 fans in attendance. In USC’s 13 home matches this season, they’ve averaged about 400 fans.
BYU has a home record of 8-2 this season. Their losses were courtesy of No. 3 Stanford in mid-January and No. 6 Pepperdine in mid-March. USC has an opposite away record of 2-8. They’ve struggled this season, but especially on the road.
Despite the daunting conditions, Nygaard isn’t afraid of the challenge ahead of the Trojans.
“I would expect them to win,” Nygaard said. “I don’t see any reason otherwise.”
Nygaard, a former UCLA men’s volleyball standout, has experience playing in BYU and knows what it’s like to head into that “hostile environment.”
“I think it’s a great environment for volleyball,” Nygaard said. “I love going there and I love competing there.”
As the season is drawing to a close, Nygaard shared his belief that all of the ups and downs of the season will help transition the team for next year.
“Everything we’ve done this year is helping us transition for next year,” Nygaard said. “Regardless of what happens, it’s always going to transition to the next year.”
The adversities of this season will aid the Trojans in becoming a more weathered, toughened team. Pair that with a longer time under Nygaard’s direction and plan, and the Trojans look to come out firing for next season.
But before they can move on to any of that, they’ll have to take on the Cougars.

A scorching start · Senior attacker Caroline deLyra pivots in a game against Michigan in March. The women’s lacrosse team is 11-0 this season. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
The unforgettable ending to Monday night’s NCAA men’s basketball title game had everyone buzzing. Everywhere I went in the ensuing 24 hours, people, basketball fans or not, wanted to talk about it — Uber drivers, baristas, professors and even my mother, who texted me after the game. And it was truly incredible, but something has been bugging me and it’s time I storm the Wildcats’ stage to say my piece: “Yo Villanova, I’m really happy for you, I’ll let you finish, but UConn women’s basketball is one of the best dynasties of all time!”
The Huskies’ 31-point win over Syracuse in the national championship Tuesday night gave the program its fourth consecutive title, capping off another undefeated season, and extending its historic winning streak to a whopping 75 games. With his 11th championship overall, head coach Geno Auriemma moved past the legendary John Wooden for most titles won by any coach in the sport all-time. Senior Breanna Stewart also became the first player on the women’s or men’s side to ever win four tournament most valuable players awards.
These are remarkable feats and records that will very likely never be broken by any coach, player or team in collegiate basketball. For some mysterious reason, though, perhaps still lost in all of the crying Jordan memes and game-winning shot reactions, no one’s chatting or buzzing about the history that was just made by the Huskies. I tried bringing it up in conversation with some of my more athletic colleagues and the response I got was, “There was a championship game last night?”
This type of oblivion towards the women’s game brings forward the very sad, yet true, reality of the attitudes towards it. I asked a few peers, males specifically, why they didn’t watch the women’s basketball Final Four and the answer I received each and every time was “because no one cares.” It shouldn’t be that way, but the harsh truth is that this is the way a lot of people, and not just males, use to justify their lack of appeal for women’s sports. It’s really tragic because as someone who has covered multiple collegiate women’s sports and practiced with them on the court, I watch, I care, and more people should begin to as well.
At USC, the spotlight is almost always centered on football, men’s basketball and baseball. That’s because it’s what’s considered the social norm. In fact, I’ve previously been made fun of when I’ve said I was headed to a women’s basketball or women’s volleyball game. That’s just not right.
Why can’t the spotlight shift to sports like women’s water polo, lacrosse or beach volleyball in the spring? In just its fourth season, the women’s lacrosse team is undefeated, as is the women’s water polo team, who is also ranked the No. 1 team in the country. The beach volleyball program is the last USC team to win a national championship after it turned in a perfect 28-0 season. Why do these high-achieving teams garner our attention and fanfare?
One can’t deny the large gap that already exists when it comes to fan interest in men’s and women’s sports. This is nothing new, and the UConn women’s basketball team is just a microcosm of this inequality. One columnist even had the nerve to say that UConn was killing the women’s game. In the men’s game, dominance is celebrated, while in the women’s game, it’s frowned upon. Would I be lying if I said that everyone, including sports talk shows and networks, would be salivating if the Duke or Kentucky men’s teams had won 50-plus straight games and counting?
So what’s it going to take for women’s teams to get the same type of treatment? We’ve grown up on the notion that boys are naturally stronger and faster than girls, but that doesn’t mean women shouldn’t be celebrated for athletic accomplishments. That belief makes it just as much a societal culture issue. Then, there are those that say the women’s game isn’t as “entertaining,” so that’s why they don’t watch.
“They can’t dunk, so what’s the point,” someone told me.
It has even gotten to the point where there’s a lot of discussion around lowering the rim in women’s basketball, which in turn, would add a whole new element to the game. Former UConn star and WNBA player Diana Taurasi powerfully responded to that idea by saying, “Might as well put us in skirts and back in the kitchen.”
Women’s sports have come too far and made too many strides to digress now. Just in the past few years, Becky Hammon became the first female assistant coach in the NBA, Jen Welter became the NFL’s first female coach and former softball player Jessica Mendoza emerged as the first female broadcaster to call a Major League Baseball game on ESPN. While there is a long way to go for total equality, the leagues and the sports themselves have done their part. It’s now the fans’ turn to “lean in” to ensure that the women’s game garners the attention it very much deserves.

People spend their entertainment dollars and TV hours watching events that are the best.  It’s not sexist to say women sporting events are not on the caliber of men’s events.  They are not.

USC’s only virtual reality club will be hosting its first-ever annual student Virtual Reality Festival and Demo Day on April 15. Taking place at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, the event is meant to promote and educate students on the ever-expanding medium of virtual reality.
In early 2015, mechanical engineering student Jake Green realized that there was no organization for students interested in virtual reality at USC. By the end of January of that year, VRSC was founded and is now comprised of a group of fourteen students across the University interested in promoting and creating new stories through VR.
For the month of March, VRSC accepted applications from students with their own VR projects, with the promise of up to $5,000 in cash prizes for the best stories and concepts. With applications for 360 live action video, animation, interactive games and augmented realities, the showcase is meant to mirror the School of Cinematic Arts’ long-running Demo Day meant for peers, professors and industry professionals to gain a look into the ever-expanding new medium of virtual reality.
Virtual reality is a new platform meant to engage users through the use of an immersive, 3-D  landscape. Experienced through a headset that wraps around the user’s face, VR seems to be the buzzword on everyone’s lips. The New York Times sent weekly subscribers Google cardboard headsets to attach to phones last year.
Big-name companies like Facebook and Sony have also started to become involved in the Virtual Reality world. According to technology site TechCrunch, “Virtual reality is no longer creeping into the mainstream: It’s leaping.” Even film production
companies have put a foot in the pool, as Annapurna Pictures — the production company responsible for movies such as American Hustle and Zero Dark Thirty — has begun to develop and release properties for the platform. In 2015, Annapurna released its first VR story, designed by artist Chris Milk, the video Evolution of Verse premiered at last year’s Sundance Film Festival New Frontier section. The just-ended South by Southwest festival — a longtime festival pioneer of interactive media — was a host to a litany of engaging content this past March as well, with a special track of their Interactive section specifically dedicated to VR.
However, according to TechCrunch, VR’s “next major obstacle will be content.” The platform is undoubtedly revolutionary and interesting, but it’ll truly require engaging and arresting stories and content to draw viewers in. Microsoft’s Oculus Rift VR headset and controller retails for $600, which means that users will need to feel drawn to the stories being offered on the headset if Microsoft can hope to make any profit. On the other end of the spectrum, VR headsets like Google Cardboard retail for around $20, but the lower-tech quality of the device may make VR feel like a gimmick or toy rather than a tool that can be taken seriously in the cinematic world.
USC School of Cinematic Arts has long been on the cutting edge of technology. With one of the leading programs on Interactive Media in the world, it’s only a matter of time before whole classes may be dedicated to the emerging Virtual Reality universe. VRSC’s Festival and Promo day is only the beginning.

Two days before the highly anticipated grand opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood, fans, celebrities and Muggles were treated to a celebration of the park’s opening with a performance led by award-winning composer John Williams.
The event began with a red carpet arrival of celebrities that included stars of Harry Potter fame, such as Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the series, and James and Oliver Phelps, who played Fred and George Weasley, respectively. Other celebrities also attended, including Mindy Kaling and Steven Spielberg.
Visitors were invited to explore Hogsmeade village and  had the opportunity to experience the park’s interactive wand features and taste-test Butterbeer and the food that will be made available come opening day.
The event began with a performance of “Double Trouble” — also known as “Something Wicked This Way Comes” — by the Frog Choir, resembling the performance by the choir of the same name in the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
Shortly prior to Williams’ performance, Universal and Warner Brothers executives took to the stage to thank and congratulate those who had a role in seeing the Los Angeles theme park come to life over the past five years.
“Tonight, Universal Studios welcomes one of the most powerful brands of our generation, and the preeminent cultural cornerstone of contemporary literature and movies,” said Larry Kurzweil, president of Universal Studios Hollywood.
L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti was among those mentioned, and in a speech complete with Harry Potter references and jokes, Garcetti discussed the positive impact that the Wizarding World’s opening would have on Los Angeles.
“When I became your mayor I set the goal to bring 50 million visitors to Los Angeles by 2020, because that means jobs and prosperity for all of our communities,” Garcetti said. “We expect the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to bring even more tourists to Los Angeles every year … These are the visitors that bring the same vibrant diversity to our city that help Muggles, wizards, witches, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students face the world together as brave, loyal and strong people.”
Conducted by John Williams, the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra performed two numbers from Williams’ Harry Potter scores. Williams composed the scores for the films in the franchise, including well-known tracks such as “Hedwig’s Theme” and “Harry’s Wondrous World.” As a wave of nostalgia swept over event attendees, the performance was complemented by fireworks and a synchronized digital lighting show projected onto Hogwarts castle behind the orchestra.
Fans of Harry Potter will be blown away by the captivating magic of the theme park for years to come.
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter will officially open to the public on Thursday. According to a Universal Studios press release, online tickets to the theme park are already sold out for opening day.

I’m often asked if I’m so outspoken because my culture and religion call for females to be subservient. “Outspoken” is one of the nicer terms — sometimes people use loud or unsubtle.
“That’s racist!” is what I’d love to say. Instead, I inform whoever it is that no, my religion and culture don’t call for obedient females and that my parents raised me to say what’s on my mind. I also inform the person that, as a child, I was never told that boys and girls are capable of and destined for different things. I played with Barbie dolls and plastic swords, and I only hated science and math because I found them boring.
The usual response to that is that my parents must be pretty progressive, to which I say, “That’s also racist.”
The truth is, the supposed discrepancies between male and female brains are being taught worldwide, in conservative and liberal cultures, and by members of all religions.
Pink is for girls; blue is for boys. Girls are soft and delicate, boys are tough and can take anything. Boys are better at science; girls are better at housekeeping. These are the statements most of us grew up with. “It’s how our brains are hardwired!” say those who believe them.
Cordelia Fine, author of Delusions of Gender: The Real Science Behind Sex Differences, begs to differ. Delusions of Gender is Fine’s scientifically-backed middle finger to all those who believe that gender bias is based in biology — I’m looking at you, meninist in my sociology class.
Why are girls told to aspire to princess-hood and child-rearing, while boys are expected to have successful careers and provide for their future families?
“Measures of implicit associations reveal that men, more than women, are implicitly associated with science, maths, career, hierarchy and high authority,” Fine writes. “In contrast, women, more than men, are implicitly associated with the liberal arts.”
According to Fine, research into associative memory shows that if you place a woman in a housekeeping environment, associative memory will pick up the pattern. Associative memory is very susceptible to accepting subliminal messages, through advertising, media representation and/or societal ideals, whether we like it or not.
Much of the literature “proving” the difference between male and female brains focuses on the empathetic nature of women when compared to their more logical counterparts, men. Fine gives the example of Louann Brizendine’s The Female Brain. Brizendine’s patient, Jane, and her husband Evan are having breakfast when she notices that Evan’s eyes are “darting back and forth.” Immediately, Jane recognizes this behavior and asks, “What are you thinking about? Who are you beating in court right now?”
“To be brutally honest,” writes Fine, as though she is anything but, “at breakfast I prefer to reserve the majority of my neurons for the thinking of my own thoughts, not those of others. But while Brizendine’s claims are somewhat extravagant – is it really true that women have more privileged access to men’s thoughts than they do themselves, or that ‘a man can’t seem to spot an emotion unless someone cries or threatens bodily harm’? – we’re all familiar with the concept of womanly intuition and womanly tenderness.”
Fine deals with gender bias in different environments, ranging from the home to the workplace. Fine also talks about how parents unintentionally teach their children sexism: calling young girls, “princess,” and young boys, “womanizers”; pink housekeeping toys for girls, and blue/green toy trucks and soldiers for boys.
Delusions of Gender is not a late-night easy read. It’s brimming with scientific research and psychology, and at times I had to put it down so I could focus on absorbing what I just read. Nevertheless, Fine conclusively finds that although there is a difference in male and female brain, it is created through perpetuating neuro-sexism through societal standards, media, and culture. That is how gender is “wired.”
“But,” Fine writes, “the wiring is soft, not hard. It is flexible, malleable and changeable. And, if we only believe this, it will continue to unravel.”

Two weeks ago, the U.S. Library of Congress announced its decision to abrogate the use of “illegal aliens” as a subject heading. Instead, it will use “noncitizens” and “unauthorized immigration” as bibliographic terms to organize the catalogs’ literature on immigration. This recent decision highlights not only two years of devoted activism on the part of Dartmouth College students and the need for greater student activism across the nation, but also a progressive shift in the public conscious, confronting institutional support of dehumanizing and racially charged language.
This initiative began in the summer of 2014, after Dartmouth student Melissa Padilla noticed the appearance of “illegal aliens” as a subject heading while she searched the Dartmouth catalog, organized by the Library of Congress, for a project. In response, she and other students brought this issue to the Dartmouth Coalition for Immigration Reform, Equality and DREAMers — an initiative that emphasized the pejorative connotations of this term and subsequently petitioned the Library of Congress, which also organizes the USC catalog, to remove it. In early 2015, upon the Library’s initial rejection of the group’s proposal, the American Library Association joined the student’s cause, thus forming a partnership that would influence the library’s decision to replace “illegal aliens” with neutral language.
The CoFIRED initiative and the Library of Congress’ consequent decision are a reflection of the gradual movement away from the use of this term, particularly in the media. The Associated Press, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times comprise just a small portion of the news sources that have, over the years, abandoned the word “illegal” to describe immigrants. The library noted this phenomenon in its March 22 executive summary. To this point, Robert Labaree — librarian in the Von Kleinsmid Center library — stated that subject headings are a “sign of the times.” In the past, changes to the library’s catalogs, like the eventual rejection of the n-word and other racial slurs, have similarly recognized insensitive and antiquated terminology that fails to reflect evolving discourse.
Critics, however, bewail decisions like this one as a concession to political correctness. Ira Melman, media director for the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which promotes strict enforcement of existing immigration laws, described the change as unwarranted.
“It’s giving into political correctness,” he said. “‘Illegal alien’ is a proper legal term.”
Melman’s own appeal to semantic precision and the preservation of political incorrectness is misguided. The use of “illegal alien” is neither legally nor morally defensible. Firstly, the term is legally inaccurate. The word “illegal” suggests criminality when, in reality, one’s presence in the U.S. without proper documents is a civil offense, not a criminal one. Moreover, the term suggests that a “guilty” verdict has been rendered and the individual in question is a criminal defendant. Secondly, the term is morally unjustifiable. Its propagation scapegoats undocumented individuals suffering at the hands of a system unwilling to confront its own deficiencies. Moreover, words like “alien” are dehumanizing and promote racial and ethnic hatred, akin to that seen from some presidential candidates.
Recognizing the truth that semantics indeed matter, a number of representatives have made it their personal mission to remove this language from the country’s legal codes. Last August, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill that will remove “alien” from the state’s labor code. During the same period, the California Republican Party — seeking to distance itself from the likes of Donald Trump — erased the term from its official platform. In a national effort, Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from Texas, has proposed a bill that would expunge the terms “illegal alien” and “alien” from federal laws. The bill unfortunately remains untouched in the Republican-dominated House.
In the face of political gridlock, student activism, like that of the Dartmouth College students, is not only powerful but also necessary. As members of the academic community, promoting values like equality and justice, students are responsible for taking part in this effort to correct information that furthers the disenfranchisement of vulnerable communities. As the CoFIRED initiative illustrates, effectual change is possible.
“Illegal” can refer to both a civil or a criminal infraction.  
To mislead the reader into believing otherwise is disingenuous and leftist.
Great idea. At the same time, perhaps Dartmouth College activists can drive changes to the nasty, evil labels used against other criminals, e.g., murderers, muggers, burglars, robbers, drug pushers, thugs, rapists and so on. If they reflect for a few minutes, they  surely can come up with a variety of mild, neutral and non-disparaging names for these sweet, kindly people who contribute so much to our country.

For better or worse, smarter or dumber, the booming industry of wearable technology continues to shape the landscape of health and fitness today. Fitbit announced last week that it has sold more than a million units of Fitbit Blaze, the company’s first smartwatch, in the first month of sales. Fitbit Alta, its newest fitness tracker, has performed equally well. As these statistics show, there’s no doubt we live in a time of hyperawareness when it comes to fitness — and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
In an era plagued with an obesity epidemic, building a culture of self-surveillance just can’t hurt. Nearly one in three people alive today is obese or overweight, a global issue affecting people of all ages and incomes. No country has succeeded in lowering its obesity rates since 1980.
In these dire times, wearable technology may be our saving grace.
A trend that brings fitness and healthy eating back into the spotlight, wearables have become increasingly present in the lives of Americans — and in particular, millennials. Currently, according to a Nielsen Connected Life Report, one in six Americans owns a wearable tech item. Of these owners, 48 percent are ages 18 to 34.
The reach is global as well. According to the International Business Times, Forrester Research reported that 35 percent of millennials will buy a fitness wearable in the next year. The International Food Information Council’s 2015 Food and Health survey found that 36 percent of millennials track daily food and beverage intake via an app or other means. Diet documentation is especially important because no matter how much exercise, you can’t outrun a bad diet.
This phenomenon results from the tech advances of the past decade. The Nike+iPod Sport Kit debuted in 2006 as a wireless sensor placed in specialized shoes to sync biometric data to iPod Nanos. At the 2008 Techcrunch50 conference, Fitbit CEO James Park showcased a tracker that had transformed the age-old pedometer into an aid that would give people a better sense of their daily activity levels, from caloric burn to sleep patterns. Today, hundreds of different fitness trackers exist. Devices include the Apple Watch, Nike Fuel Band, Jawbone UP and Samsung Galaxy Gear.
In addition to function, form and aesthetics also carry great weight in design, a testament to how integrated these devices have and will become in consumers’ daily lives. Wired magazine deemed 2015 the year “wearables will stop being so ugly,” a statement that notes how intertwined fitness, fashion and tech are. In March 2015, Intel partnered with Google and the Swiss luxury watchmaker, TAG Heuer to develop a “distinctive smartwatch.” According to Wired, Swarovski has been working with wearable manufacturer Misfit since 2013 to develop the Swarovski Shine collection, which features bejeweled activity trackers synced to your phone, marking the advent of smart jewelry.
In recent years, the industry has even embedded sensors into clothing. The world’s first “smart” bra, the OMbra, debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show this year. The team behind the OMbra also designed 2014’s Ralph Lauren Polo Tech shirt, which features silver fiber sensors knitted in to collect biological and physiological data synced to an app.
Though it may all seem too futuristic for comfort, wearable tech has its benefits, especially for athletics. Just this week, according to the Associated Press, Major League Baseball’s playing rules committee approved two devices for use during the game — the Motus Baseball Sleeve measures elbow stress and the Zephyr Bioharness monitors heart and breathing rates. Both will help catch harmful habits before they lead to injuries.
Wearable tech has great transformative potential in healthcare as well. Here at USC, the Center of Body Computing promotes collaboration among experts from technology, healthcare and entertainment to develop transformative healthcare solutions, including wearable sensors.
Outside the hospital room, these trackers also boost motivation for the everyday person because they hold their owners accountable. When every step you take is recorded, reaching a daily goal becomes more fulfilling. In the same way, they force us to reflect and confront different health issues, such as how much — or little — we sleep, an underrated concern especially among college students.
At the end of the day, these data-crunching gadgets that promise to help us live better, longer,and more fruitfully will prove helpful only if we understand that a Fitbit alone doesn’t work magic. Health is holistic, and the effectiveness of our Fitbits still boils down to us. After all, no matter how invincible a fitness tracker can make us feel, we can’t escape our midnight snacking or weekly all-nighters.

The Voice has become one of the most popular musical shows on television, far surpassing American Idol and others in the genre in the last several years. With it’s famous judges and all-star talent, the show presents one of the most collective and honest evolution of talent on television. 
Two of the judges, stars Adam Levine and Blake Shelton have been on the show since its inception. With several winners each, these two have become the power duo of the journey. For its upcoming 11th season, two new judges are taking over the spots of previous stars Pharrell Williams and Christina Aguilera. The newcomers are soul-queen Alicia Keys and pop diva Miley Cyrus. These two judges are definitely an interesting dichotomy to add to the show with their highly differing styles. 
Keys, multi-award winning artist will be adding a new soulful approach to the show that many past judges haven’t been able to bring. Keys is an accomplished musician, playing instruments from piano to drums and will be able to add a more technical approach to the judging ring. Her stylistic approach will also be new to the group combining soul, jazz and pop all together. The contestants on her team will be opened to a whole new level of technical perfection and old-school influence that could shoot them right to the top. 
Cyrus on the other hand, should be interesting and unpredictable new addition. This pop-star started on Disney (not exactly known for its long-standing stellar talent) and broke through the ceiling becoming an overly sexualized and characterized image. Despite her outlandish self-presentation, Cyrus could introduce another new concept to the contestants on the show. Cyrus’s ability to form her own character and image could greatly influence the contestants. She will have a keen eye for the marketable contestants, people who have a “look” or just something about them that could help them take their talent to the top. 
Both of the new judges served as mentors on past seasons and proved to be greatly helpful and liked among the past contestants. Despite the differences in style, image and genre, these two leading lady stars have the potential to create winning teams on this upcoming season of the show.
