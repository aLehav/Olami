A New York State Supreme Court judge ruled against releasing pop star Kesha out of an exclusive six-album contract with Kemosabe Records on Friday. Kesha’s suit included claims of sexual, physical, verbal and emotional abuse against the head of Kemosabe Records, Lukasz Gottwald, also known as Dr. Luke. Regardless of legal logistics, Kesha’s case has also incited much dialogue surrounding rape culture in today’s society. With recent stories surrounding sexual assault and consent politics, especially on college campuses, Kesha’s case affirms why a majority of abuse victims choose not to report assault. Taking into consideration the ugly stigma already unjustly associated with rape survivors, rarely is there ever a situation in which justice is served in favor of the victim.
Kesha’s case began in October 2014, when she officially filed suit against Dr. Luke and Kemosabe Records. Kesha also stated that Dr. Luke’s abuse was so severe that she “nearly lost her life,” according to Rolling Stone. Kemosabe Records, a sub-label of Sony Music Entertainment, has been run exclusively by Dr. Luke since 2011. In addition to his work on Kesha’s last two albums, Dr. Luke is also known for his collaborations with Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Pink and many more. Dr. Luke also holds a large amount of power in the industry, thus complicating the case.
In a society that not-so-unconsciously sympathizes with the abuser, it is understandable why so many incidents go unreported. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, also known as RAINN, a whopping 68 percent of sexual assault goes unreported to the police. In this same study, it was reported that 98 percent of rapists would never spend a day in jail. It seems that victims must go to extraordinary lengths to be taken seriously. Part of the reasoning behind the court’s decision was insufficient evidence to corroborate Kesha’s claims. However, what most fail to realize is that rape and sexual abuse are often spotless crimes, making it nearly impossible to provide concrete evidence.
In addition to invalidating Kesha’s claims, this ruling also forces her to work exclusively with Dr. Luke, according to the initial contract. This decision forces Kesha to remain in an environment in which she feels degraded and unsafe. In essence, the court’s decision dehumanizes Kesha. In this realm of legal battles and contracts, Kesha is treated as a conglomerate or brand name, almost as if her entity created by the entertainment industry is her only identity.
Regardless of the court’s decision, Kesha’s support continues to build among the public. The issue has also sparked a whirlwind of controversy via social media. The hashtag #FreeKesha was created by fans to show their support to release Kesha from her contract with Kemosabe Records, as well as a GoFundMe campaign to raise $2 million dollars to buy Kesha out of her Sony contract. Celebrities in support of Kesha include Fiona Apple, Margaret Cho and Taylor Swift, with Swift donating $250,000 toward buying out Kesha’s Sony contract. On Tuesday, Kesha released her first statement since the court’s ruling via Instagram. She stated, “Thank you is not enough but it is all I have. A million times over and forever thank you.”
The battle doesn’t seem to be over, either. Taking into consideration the torrential amount of support Kesha has already received, Kesha’s freedom may be attainable. Her case paints a very real picture of not only abuse in the entertainment industry, but also a greater antagonistic attitude toward sexual assault victims.

Diversity is a pretty word. At face value, the word conjures up images of middle-school illustrations of differently colored people holding hands, standing on top of a badly drawn globe. And perhaps it is this view of diversity as a superficial ideal of American pluralism that drives the growing discrepancy in diversity conversations between students and administrations, both on USC’s campus and on college campuses nationwide.
Some of the discrepancy — and cluelessness on part of the administration — could be a symptom of the fact that “diversity” means something different to students than it does to university officials. Whereas the administration is quick to point to our low-income and international student populations as proof that diversity issues are not as bad as we say they are, students are more interested in using “diversity” as a term to provide structural support to students who have been marginalized. It’s not about access — it’s about supporting students once they get here
The reality is that the issues that “diversity” cover are much more displeasing than the term itself. Whether they vary from blatant prejudice or offensive party themes, students are seeking institutional support against the — to borrow from Provost Michael Quick — “wicked problems” of racism, sexism and injustice.
For student activists, university officials and members of the community, we’re up against a lot.
And yet, again and again — whether it be in C. L. Max Nikias’ State of the University speech or in continuous open forums — the attitude toward creating tangible solutions for dismantling these structures has been superficial at best. Yes, the university has made progress toward implementing diversity training and funding inclusivity initiatives. And they have stressed — stressed — the importance of creating a “dialogue,” be it through open forums or task force meetings or a strategic planning committee. Moreover, the importance of transparency and communication between the administration and students cannot be understated. But many marginalized students are asking — why have these conversations not manifested into the adoption of the legitimate plans of action passed by the Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government last semester?
To a certain extent, it’s fair to contend that students should be patient. A hostile environment cannot be transformed instantly — and advocacy at a university as large as USC comes with significant red tape. But the tangible measures that the university has adopted so far — diversity trainings and increased funding for diversity — much more closely suggest a university placating students with band-aid solutions while delaying the more large-scale actions. On one level, it’s because these solutions require a more critical — and not-so-favorable — look at why USC, as an institution, has failed marginalized students. To improve diversity among our mentors in the classroom, it takes recognizing that our faculty remains dominated by white men to take steps. To improve our cultural centers, it takes admitting that they are understaffed and underfunded — and nonexistent for many communities, like Middle Eastern or disabled students. To fix current administrative structures, it takes realizing that they do not fully support students now.
For student leaders who have worked tirelessly on this issue, USC’s tone-deaf attitude certainly doesn’t help forge stronger relationships with students. When Nikias gave his State of the University speech earlier this month, he focused on diversity — but instead of recognizing the work that still needed to be done, he congratulated the creation of a “dialogue” and spotlighted the role of K-12 educators to create a pipeline for marginalized students to come to college. And while those notions are admirable, they’re blatantly missing the point — USC students want to see tangible policy change to create a supportive environment, not more empty words.
When student activists embarked on the overwhelming task of creating a more inclusive campus climate, they began a journey that will likely cement our generation’s collective legacy in a world in which university students come from more divergent backgrounds than ever. Such is a symptom of an increasingly globalized world that has had to grapple with creating common identity among a system that still oppresses minority communities.
For now, it seems that the university has embraced the feel-good, sugar-on-top definition of “diversity.” But students haven’t — and students shouldn’t. When students showed their collective force last semester — be it at unprecedented attendance in Senate meetings or in demonstrations outside Bovard Auditorium — the administration was responsive. Trojans — it’s up to us to continue this conversation.
The Campus Climate Coalition held their first meeting Wednesday night. As the next phase of advocacy for diversity initiatives continues, it’s important to continue to hold the administration accountable for implementing the change we want to see.

Why don’t you be specific when you say you want the university to “support students once they get here”? What does that really mean?  Should they be coddled? Should they be given breaks that other students don’t get?  Ironically, the discrimination that you are fighting against is exactly what you advocating for, only in reverse form.

The Library Foundation of Los Angeles hosted novelist Hanya Yanagihara in conversation with Matthew Specktor on Tuesday. The discussion, which was held in the Mark Taper Auditorium at the Los Angeles Public Library’s Central Library, revolved around Yanagihara’s latest novel A Little Life, which received mass acclaim and unexpected popularity upon its release.
Hailed as “a writer to marvel at” by The New York Times Book Review, Yanagihara appears through Library Foundation of Los Angeles’ ALOUD program, a “celebrated literary series of conversations, readings and performances,” according to its website. Past events have featured Salman Rushdie, Judy Bloom, Toni Morrison and Margaret Atwood, among others. Tuesday’s discussion was a sold-out event, as reported on the event’s website.
Prior to the release of A Little Life in early 2015, Yanagihara was a relatively unknown writer. Her debut novel, The People in the Trees, was released in early 2013, and though the work received positive reviews from critics, her work remained under-the-radar. Following the release of A Little Life, the novel soon gained heavy momentum, becoming a sleeper hit and establishing Yanagihara’s credibility as one of the foremost novelists of this generation. A paperback version of A Little Life was released last month.
Set in New York City, A Little Life follows the lives of four college friends post-graduation, examining their evolving relationships over many decades. Despite the highly sensitive material present throughout the novel and the hefty length of the book itself (topping at just more than 700 pages), the novel has not only received praise from critics but also developed a huge fan base. In the discussion, Yanagihara stated her editor’s apprehension to publish a book of its length with such challenging content.
“One of the arguments I had with my editor was this idea of ‘What is too much for the reader to bear?’” Yanagihara said. She went on to discuss that what draws readers to these themes are the deeply personal ways in which they’re able to process these subjects.
“There are points in this book in which the characters know more than the reader, and there are points where the readers know more than the characters themselves,” Yanagihara said.
Yanagihara also discussed the artistic inspiration that impacted this book. The novel features many references to classical music, which she stated was a nod to her father, who loved opera and German lieder.
“The book is arranged and structured like a symphony,” Yanagihara continued. “The little themes that come up … I really want it to feel like a little bit of melody that loops in again and again.”
Yanagihara isn’t the only high profile novelist featured this year. The ALOUD program is renowned for hosting some of the most influential and well-respected authors in the world. Earlier this month, LFLA announced its spring season for ALOUD. The spring season will open on March 10 with an evening honoring science-fiction writer Octavia E. Butler. In addition, future events will include Sebastião Salgado, Helen Macdonald, Vivian Gornick, as well as author and professor at USC Viet Thanh Nguyen.
Most ALOUD events are free to the public, with priority reservations available to members of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles. More information regarding ALOUD’s spring season can be found online.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a man, when in conversation with a woman, will always explain things unnecessarily.
I recently met a fellow Trojan at an event. He seemed a little out of depth, standing to the side on his own, staring down at the gathered people — he was by far the tallest person in the room. He seemed uncomfortable, as though he couldn’t understand how he ended up at this particular event.
If you’ve ever been at a USC event where pizza was served, you know how crazy things can get; free food and starved, broke college students is always cause for a frenzy. Having been focused on grabbing a cheesy slice before it was all gone, I didn’t notice that he’d moved until he was standing next to me in line, paper plate and napkin in hand.
“Hi,” he said, his voice barely loud enough to be heard over the din.
“Hi,” I replied, distracted by the possibility of pizza running out.
In hindsight, I should have probably pretended to have not heard him. Why? Because what followed was the most excruciatingly mind-numbing hour of conversation I’ve ever endured.
The guy, who shall go unnamed, was a self-proclaimed Expert On All Things, whether it be philosophy or comic books. For the latter, he fired question after complicated question at me, clearly of the mind that I was a “fake geek girl,” which is an insulting stereotype for females across the world.
Halfway through his explanation of why drones are so much more intricate than I, a mere girl, could understand, I was struck by this guy’s need to explain things to me. Every topic I brought up, he quickly took control, as though establishing his position as an alpha male.
That night, after venting about the ordeal on Tumblr, my friend sent me a commiserating message and a book recommendation: Men Explain Things To Me by Rebecca Solnit.
Men Explain Things To Me began as an essay which went viral. Solnit’s hilarious, yet critical tone was so familiar to many women, who have had similar condescending interactions with men. Solnit also inspired the popular term “mansplaining,” which gave rise to other terms such as “manspreading.”
Mansplaining happens in all environments, but its effects are felt more in the academic world, where men’s entitlement to intellectual space often silences their female counterparts.
“Yes, people of both genders pop up at events to hold forth on irrelevant things and conspiracy theories, but the out-and-out confrontational confidence of the totally ignorant is, in my experience, gendered,” Solnit writes. “Men explain things to me, and other women, whether or not they know what they’re talking about. Some men.”
Solnit is, of course, correct. Although generalizing all men is not very charitable, it’s reasonable to say all women and girls have been catcalled or patronized or demeaned by men. That is not to say that all men are evil; it’s just that the patriarchal society we live in has conditioned boys to grow up thinking that females lack that fundamental something that makes them as worthy as males.
“Every woman knows what I’m talking about,” Solnit continues.
In  an interview with The Guardian, Solnit revealed that even after the success of her essay-turned-book, men still explain things to her! Can you say unreal?
“If there were awards to be handed out, one might go to the man who told me and a woman friend that 1) women actually like all those catcalls 2) as a man who’s spent time in men’s-only locker rooms, he knows men don’t actually speak to women that way,” Solnit said. “Just ask an expert. Who is not a lady.”
Noorhan Maamoon is a junior majoring in print and digital journalism.  Her column, “The Hijabi Monologues,” runs on Thursdays. 
Men over explain worldly topics. Women over explain social topics. Deal with it because we sure have too. 
If you don’t like the way men communicate, just avoid them and stop complaining.

Despite being a health nut who seldom eats added sugar — save for the occasional piece of 95 percent dark chocolate — visiting Donut Farm, a new all vegan doughnut shop, was a must. Since its opening on Feb. 13, Donut Farm has been booming with business. Located in the trendy hub of Silverlake, where hipsters and vegans alike frequently flock to the innovative shops throughout the neighborhood, the shop has so far been well-received.
Josh Levine founded Donut Farm in 2007. With the help of the community eager for a vegan doughnut company, Donut Farm was eventually born. Based out of Northern California, the other three Donut Farm shops are located in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.
Donut Farm is the first vegan doughnut shop in Los Angeles. The bakers produce high quality doughnuts from scratch, using ingredients that are free of chemical stabilizers and dyes. The head baker, known mononymously as Mack, described the delectability of the doughnuts, which are made of premium ingredients such as organic cane sugar, organic soy flour, organic flax seed and, for certain doughnuts, organic coconut milk.
“We’re not going to claim that it’s health food, since it’s still a fried doughnut and still sugar, but it is the lesser of two evils, and vegan!” Mack said.
Indeed, the vegan doughnuts are the lesser of two evils, since no animals were exploited in the process, and most of the ingredients leave small carbon footprints. These cruelty-free and environmentally friendly doughnuts are incredibly satisfying for vegans and non-vegans alike. Light and airy in texture, it is easy to quickly consume these delicious doughnuts.
“They’re really light, I can have three of them, and ask myself, can I have another one?” Mack said.
After praising the doughnuts, Mack hand-picked six doughnuts to sample: matcha green tea, blueberry (made with fresh organic blueberries), roasted red chili, salted caramel, classic glaze and lavender earl grey. All of the doughnuts were equally delicious, with distinctive tastes. Each bite burst with a multitude of flavors — predominantly sweet, of course. For someone easily overwhelmed by ample doses of sugar, the doughnuts resulted in no negative aftermath, and instead resulted in pure bliss.
In addition to their variety of doughnuts, Donut Farm also sells hibiscus teas, juices, cold brew coffee and merchandise. Their in-store merchandise consists of mugs, t-shirts and zip hoodies that all have the stylish Donut Farm logo on them. They also give away complimentary stickers and pins (great for decking out laptops and backpacks!).
If they couldn’t be any more innovative, Donut Farm is in the process of developing their own ingredients.
“We are working on cultivating our own yeast right now, and it’s going to take a few more days for us to be able to actually use it. So until then, we are still using commercial yeast. After that, we are going to be totally self-sufficient,” Mack said.
As far as future plans, Mack and Josh Levine are constantly brainstorming new flavors. They have 30 so far and are continuing their flavor expansion.

The Trojan track and field teams will be heading to Seattle, Washington, this weekend to compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Indoor Track and Field Championships. The women’s team will seek to hold onto their title for the third year in a row, while the men’s team will attempt to dethrone Oregon, who narrowly beat them last year.
The MPSF ITFC is a competition created in 1992 and designed for Division I West Coast schools. This year, 14 men’s teams and 19 women’s teams will be in attendance. Though the Trojan men’s team is looking solid, as they are currently ranked ninth in the nation by the USTFCCA NCAA Division I National Team Computer Rankings, they will have to be wary of strong competition from Oregon’s squad, which is ranked second on that list, and Washington’s, which is ranked twelfth. Meanwhile, the No. 10 Women of Troy will have to battle Oregon’s first-ranked roster and Washington’s seventeenth-ranked team.
Though the women of Troy aren’t number one in the nation, junor sprinter Destinee Brown is still convinced that she and her teammates have targets on their backs. Brown said she is willing to do whatever it takes to earn the victory.
“I feel like we’re definitely the team to beat,” Brown said. “[Personal records] are great, but I would rather win than PR. But if I have to PR to win, then that’s what we’re trying to do.”
Coach Caryl Smith Gilbert echoes the sentiment. Though most teams facing SC this weekend are not ranked, she acknowledges that competition will still be tough.
“At the end of the day, the ranking doesn’t matter,” Gilbert said. “It’s about what you do on the day. There are a lot great teams and a lot of great competitors in the conference that want to make sure to give us a run for our money.”
The men’s squad will make their second-ever appearance at the indoor event, and their good performances so far this season suggest that it will be a strong one. Most notably, two weeks ago, in the Tyson Invitational men’s triple jump event, junior Eric Sloan set a personal record (55ft, 10.50in) to win the competition and claim the farthest jump by a college athlete this season. Sophomore Randall Cunningham placed fourth in the high jump (7ft, 3.25in) at the Tyson long jump event.
The women’s lineup is also looking very competitive. USC currently holds the MPSF ITFC women’s 1600m relay record (3:33.58), which was set last year. It may be beaten, as the quartet of sophomore Kendall Ellis, junior Amalie Iuel, senior Jaide Stepter and Brown set a school record (3:28.82) at the 2016 Tyson invitational in the women’s 1600m relay. Also at the 2016 Tyson invitational, Iuel set personal records in the women’s 400m (52.52) and in the women’s 60m HH (8.504). The same day, Katerina Berdousi placed second overall with a PR of 4:57:43 in the women’s 1600m, and Rebekah Ent posted a PR of 2:12:91 in the women’s 800m to place seventh overall.
Following the MPSF ITFC, the Trojan track and field athletes can look forward to closing out the indoor season with the NCAA Indoor Championships in Birmingham, Alabama, in early March.

“If all I knew about Africa were from popular images I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars.” – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
Alya Omar | Daily Trojan
In my weeks leading up to my departure, I would be lying if I said I didn’t notice the flick of raised eyebrows when I told people I was spending a semester in South Africa. I got a few “Wow, Africa?”s and more than a few “What will you be doing there?”s. The unspoken question under these conversations pointed at the belief that it made more sense for me to go there to do something for a semester, like build a library or feed the entire continent with a suitcase full of McDonalds, and not that I had the privilege of attending the best university on the continent and maybe even the planet. For me, attending the University of Cape Town was no question. I’ve always been interested in the way that media portrays the African continent and how that translates to the limited Western perception of both its complexities and triumphs. I actually chose this issue as the topic for a video project for my digital studies class back at USC, and flipping through films and images of South Africa was largely the reason I fell in love with it in the first place.

Nevertheless, South Africa is a country with first-world infrastructure and third-world problems. In the morning, I run down six flights of stairs to catch the Jammie bus up the road to the university, and then I watch as several townships pass by. These shacks are urban living areas in which black Africans, Coloured Africans and Indians were forced to relocate to during the late 19th century until the end of apartheid in 1994.

Seeing as the era of separation was a mere twenty years ago, the discourse about race relations and reconciliation finds a place just about anytime and anywhere: in classroom discussions, during chats while in line for a sandwich and even during 10-minute Uber rides on the way to Long Street for a night out. Sadly, the pain of discrimination is present even on campus, but I’ll get to that another week.
I met Tumi, my roommate, when we got stuck in the elevator together in my first few minutes in the country. She was three weeks early for school, as were many others because they deferred their exams from last semester to this semester, due to the Fees Must Fall campaign. The issue with the UCT system is that if a student is unable to pay the fees for last semester, then they are banned from registering for the next class and are forced to drop out. Loans are difficult to come by and fees are outrageously high for some students who struggle to afford a textbook, much less one of the highest tuitions in the country. “So what do you do since you can’t get a loan?” I asked Tumi over dinner.

“Just pray,” she laughs, but not for too long. Protests and demonstrations happen often, not only because people are frustrated, but also because people in South Africa are so passionately engaged with the political and social issues at hand. To say that Americans are apathetic toward politics would be false, but conversations about our own idiosyncratic elections come up even with the more pressing domestic problems at hand.
On a personal note, I am having the time of my life. After bumping into approximately half of Cape Town’s population by walking on the right side of the street, I’m learning the customs of foot traffic. I’ve found my favorite braai (ridiculously good barbeque), favorite candy and favorite place on campus to read a book. South African slang has crept its way into my everyday language and I’ve learned the un-American way to say water, in the hopes of establishing street cred. I’ve successfully jumped off the world’s highest bungee jump bridge and less successfully avoided being “that kid” that runs after the Jammie with arms waving and backpack slinging. In due time, I reckon.

The School of Cinematic Arts hosted a conversation with actor and former adjunct professor James Franco and SCA alumni Clara Aranovich and Nicolaas Bertelsen on their new film, Yosemite, Tuesday night. Franco stars in the film that Aranovich and Bertelsen produced, which was released on DVD and became available for online download Tuesday. 
The film was written and directed by Gabrielle Demeestere, who based it off of the short stories “Yosemite” and “Peter Parker” from Franco’s book, A California Childhood. Its opening scene — a father with his two boys on a family trip in Yosemite National Park — was, according to Franco, the part of the film that was most closely based off of his personal experiences. 
“It was strange, re-living those experiences from my father’s perspective,” Franco said. “Going there and playing the father made me realize what a gift it was, the time and effort my father spent to take us out there and share that with us. I saw it from a completely different angle.”
Yosemite follows the lives of three fifth-grade boys in 1985 Palo Alto, California, a quiet Bay Area suburb where a mountain lion is on the prowl and each child has to come to terms with his identity and his relationships with others. The film runs on an undercurrent of tension, a building dread that something terrible is going to happen — but even as each threat fails to materialize, viewers are still left with a sense of lingering unease. This feeling, according to Franco, is what the producers of the film hoped would echo the discomfort and fear of the unknown that comes with growing up.
“I wanted [that feeling] to be on the fringe, to be a kind of haunting force rather than something they actually have to battle,” Franco said. 
Franco, whose experiences formed the basis for the film, said that he hadn’t originally planned to take on an acting role, instead focusing on promoting a campaign that raised $325,929 for the film and its sequels on Indiegogo. However, when Demeestere asked him to appear in the film, Franco agreed, recognizing that the small-budget venture — which plans to donate all of its profits to charity — would need as much help as it could get. Throughout the process, Franco realized that despite his role in writing the book that inspired the film adaptation, he wanted to let Demeestere and the producers adapt the story as they saw fit.
“If I did give feedback it would be more as a participant in a movie as if it were any other movie, not one based on my stories,” Franco said. “I wanted to make sure it worked in the best way possible rather than having [the crew] follow my version of things. A movie is a different thing than a piece of prose, and I had no desire to enforce my opinion; I wanted it to become something new.” 
Filming in Palo Alto, according to Bertelsen and Aranovich, had its own unique set of challenges, from the time limit — only 12-13 days — to the limited access to locations such as train tracks, which came with a host of legal and ethical complications. Throughout the experience, however, Bertelsen explained that he appreciated having the opportunity to work on location for a film where the setting is integral to the story. 
“I loved shooting in a place that feels like a small town, where you get that moral support from locals,” Bertelsen said.
Toward the end of the discussion, the filmmakers gave their advice for SCA students looking to pursue a career in the film industry, from production to acting. According to Aranovich, the key is to remain conscious of others in a field that so often prioritizes the individual.
“The experience of working with you should speak for itself,” Aranovich said. “A lot of people neglect the fact that they are their own brand as a collaborator, as well as what they’re producing. Remember to be good to people, and you’ll make good work.”
