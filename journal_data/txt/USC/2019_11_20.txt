USC should consider keeping at least one of its dining halls open for 24 hours. Currently, the only place students can get food and drinks on campus 24/7 is the Starbucks at Trojan Grounds near Leavey Library. While Starbucks is absolutely convenient and may be the perfect place for a late-night snack, students need access to a more substantial menu on campus — and this could take the form of a 24-hour dining hall.
All three dining halls on campus close at 10 p.m. on weekdays. While this is usually enough time to get in that last meal of the day, many USC students have busy schedules with classes and other obligations that often extend well into dinnertime. Because of this, a strict, three-meals-a-day routine is not always feasible. Especially during exam season or for those who have tight schedules, it is difficult to get back from class or study closed doors. 
After 10 p.m., students may often resort to off-campus eateries that are less convenient and may not be as healthy. Not only does this force students to leave campus after dark, but most of the surrounding restaurants are also fast-food chains that clearly do not provide the most nutritious food options. 
In the case that students choose not to go off campus, they may opt to skip meals or settle for snacking instead, which poses further health concerns. Adequate nutrition is essential to any healthy lifestyle, and while it may easily slip the minds of busy college students, USC should take the initiative to promote healthy eating habits, which can be done by keeping a dining hall open for 24 hours.
Having to eat off campus also means that students are spending extra money outside of the thousands of dollars they may already spend on meal plans. If this extra spending is not something that a student can afford, this may also lead to unhealthy eating habits. Since students may be paying more than $3,000 each semester on “unlimited” dining, why not make the dining experience truly unlimited by implementing a 24-hour system? 
Additionally, all three dining halls do not open until 7 a.m. on weekdays. This is sufficient for the majority of students, but there are some students who, because of early start times for work or class, could benefit from a 24-hour dining hall. Starting off the day with food in your system is extremely important, especially for those with the rigorous academic and professional lives that USC students often lead, and the University could better support this by opening the dining halls for 24 hours to accommodate.
A 24-hour dining hall would also mean that students would have a reliable place to eat at all times, whereas with the current system, students must schedule eating times around the 30-minute to two-hour breaks that the dining halls take to transition between meals.
There are obvious drawbacks that must be considered if a dining hall were to be open 24 hours. It may become more common for students who have been at parties to come back to dining halls late at night, and it could be difficult for dining halls to support hordes of incapacitated students. It may also be a burden in terms of resources because the University would have to hire more employees and purchase more food to support around-the-clock service.
That being said, the general population of students may greatly benefit from access to a 24-hour dining hall. To alleviate some of the stress of hiring more employees, the University might consider hiring students to clean up, for example. This would create more job opportunities for students, in addition to expanding the accessibility of on-campus dining.

There are three things that USC is famously known for: scandals, corruption and perhaps most traditionally, football. Out of the three, Trojan football has created a distinct reputation that comes with the name. Here at USC, the football season in the fall dominates every aspect of students’ social calendars. 
Every home game is accompanied by tailgating to build school spirit and excitement. The team and games are covered by local news, and virtually every student on campus recognizes the players’ names. But can all of this be too cliche? 
USC football is nationally recognized as one of the best college football teams in the Division I league. Since 1888, it has a win-loss-tie record of 839-346-54. Additionally, the team is No. 8 in the nation in bowl-winning percentage. USC is also one of the top producers of NFL draftees, claiming to have a nation-high of 509 student-athletes to be drafted thus far.  
The success and talent from the Trojans and the campus sports culture undoubtedly shape a unique aspect of the overall USC experience for students. However, the University’s current atmosphere echoes cliches that are often depicted in classic teenage rom-coms. 
Common tropes from these types of movies depict the school’s star athletes as jocks and royalties who dominate the social hierarchy. Of course, the writers exaggerate the way these fictional characters exist. USC’s football team carries the same recognition, where the quarterback’s name is plastered everywhere on social media and local news outlets that cover the games.
In the movies, the student body celebrates the team with an intense amount of school spirit and pride. This is widely encouraged here, too. At USC, the Trojan spirit and pride are everywhere, especially on game day. Tailgating is our equivalent of the celebration — a day where everyone in the community gathers on campus to build the excitement of the upcoming game, parading how awesome Trojans and the team are. 
Because USC encourages this kind of enthusiasm surrounding our football team, the players inevitably are put into a spotlight and pedestal in no fault of their own. Common students may be fascinated by the popularity that comes with the football title. Seeing players on campus instantly initiates a feeling of praise, similar to being star-struck, as is usually depicted in the movies. 
USC football culture and school spirit are unlike any other. Living in this reality feels unreal sometimes, like something out of an adolescent romantic comedy. The way we perceive and celebrate this school sport transcends the common fictional clichés from the movie screen, embedding them into reality. When everyone contributes to this celebration, these clichés are inevitably ingrained within the culture, turning it into what we eventually identify as school traditions.

Tensions were high in the Annenberg School for Communication auditorium as Clayton Dube of USC’s U.S.-China Institute sat down with Ambassador Jeffrey Bader and Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles Zhang Ping for a discussion on United States-China relations Tuesday. 
The discussion was held just hours after the U.S. Senate approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, legislation dedicated to supporting protesters in Hong Kong fighting for democracy. 
Zhang, the former Chinese ambassador to Fiji, opened the conversation with a statement on China’s development since the beginning of U.S.-China relations in the 1970s. Zhang said China is “going through profound changes unseen in a century,” in reference to the recent technological boom as well as the protests happening in Hong Kong. 
“China-U.S. relations are also going through some profound changes,” Zhang said. “Some people perceived [China’s development] as a threat to the U.S. supremacy, so they are trying to depict China as a major adversary.” 
Bader, the founding director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, outlined what he believes has changed between China and the U.S. over the last few decades, criticizing the current state of the trajectory of the country’s economic reform. 
“Since 1978 when Deng Xiaoping presided over the … Chinese Communist Party, China has been committed to restructuring its economy away from the Maoist, state-centered model towards a market-driven model,” Bader said. “There was, for some period after that, sort of a drift in economic restructuring and reform in China under subsequent leadership. In the last five or six years, it’s the consensus of most Western observers that there has been backsliding. The drive towards economic restructuring and reform and market-based change has been substituted for by an emphasis on civility and party control.”
In a later response to both Bader and the moderator, Zhang rebutted claims that economic reform in China has halted.
“China is a very big country. As we said, it’s pretty easy when you start reform because there are lots of things that can be changed easily,” Zhang said. “After certain years, what’s left? what we called hard blows, which are difficult because that kind of reform needs to be studied carefully in order to minimize the negative impact on the people … I don’t think the reform process has been slowed down.” 
As the hour wound down with a discussion on trade and economic ties between the two countries, the unease in the room did not. Dube discussed the state of human rights in China, directly referencing the government’s detention centers in Shanghai, prompting Zhang to criticize American coverage of Chinese affairs.
“The pressure on China is very much, I’ll say influenced by the Western media reports on China, which in most cases we think is pretty biased, or intentionally biased,” Zhang said. “I think they try to portray it as an issue of human rights. That kind of media influence has played a role in the perception of China. That’s why I think we need to present China in a very objective way.” 
Some students in the audience scoffed at Zhang’s response. Some got up and left the auditorium. Of the students who stayed were seniors Shichen Liu and Siyi Zhang, two public policy graduate students from China. They both criticized Zhang’s tendency to be out of touch with the people of China. 
“[He] has a tendency to… represent the officials,” Liu said. “He said a lot of official words and didn’t say a lot from his own perspective. He was there to represent the government.” 
“We want to hear something different from the Chinese side, like not what the Chinese media will say,” Zhang said. “Maybe something from his own interpretation and experience.”

After going 13-4 in the regular season, the USC men’s water polo team will compete in the MPSF Tournament this weekend in Berkeley.
USC enters the tournament as the top seed after going 3-0 against MPSF opponents, but it will have to overcome a number of talented programs to take home the championship.
The team has been playing under a new head coach this year for the first time since 1992. Although he’s been with the program for more than two decades as a player and assistant coach, Marko Pintaric officially took over the head coaching job this past summer, and the team attributes much of its success to his leadership style and approach.
“[I credit his success to] hard work, diligence, a positive attitude and mental toughness,” junior driver Jacob Mercep said. “He’s been a bedrock of our resiliency, and he demonstrated a way for us to fight off all the noise, all the negativity and just keep on doing what we’re doing and what we know how to do, which is play water polo.”
Besides USC, the tournament field includes Stanford, UCLA, Cal, Penn State Behrend and Austin College. While the Trojans may be the championship favorite in the tournament, Stanford is tied with USC as the No. 1-ranked team nationally, UCLA comes in at No. 3 and Cal enters at No. 7. Clearly, the Trojans have their work cut out for them this weekend.
Victories over these opponents will not come easily, but the Trojans have been a dominant force all season and appear to have found a rhythm in recent weeks. They concluded the regular season on a four-game winning streak, and three of their four losses on the season came by just 1 goal. Their other loss came against UCSB in mid-September but USC got its revenge with a win over the Gauchos in early October. 
Despite the team’s success so far, Pintaric said the Trojans remain focused on the task ahead of them.
“There’s always a confidence but there’s always a skepticism,” he said. “That’s just the nature of the coaching job, [but] with the guys all being healthy, I am really looking forward to this weekend.”
The tournament begins 9 a.m. Friday when Penn State Behrend and Austin College play to determine who will be the No. 5 and No. 6 seeds. The winner of that game will play Cal, while the loser will play UCLA later in the day on Friday.
Due to their top seeds, USC and Stanford will begin play in the semifinals Saturday. USC will take on the winner of Cal’s game and Stanford will play the winner of UCLA’s game. Neither Penn State Behrend nor Austin College rank among the top 20 programs nationally, so the Trojans will most likely have to overcome Cal in its own pool for the second consecutive weekend to advance to the final.
If it loses Saturday, USC will play the loser of Stanford’s game to determine the tournament’s third- and fourth-place finishers. If they win Saturday, USC will move onto Sunday’s finals and play the winner of Stanford’s Saturday contest.  
Although the Trojans appear ready to take on whoever comes between them and the MPSF Championship, they know the job is not yet done.
“This is still ‘mission not accomplished,’” Pintaric said. “To be successful in [the] postseason, we have to keep winning.”
The tournament begins Friday morning with the seed-determining game between Penn State Behrend and Austin College, but USC will begin its campaign Saturday at 11 a.m.

The No. 9-overall USC women’s soccer team is set to face No. 22 Texas A&M Friday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament as it looks to stay in the hunt for the program’s third national championship.  
The Trojans enter the game coming off a resounding 5-1 victory over Cal State Fullerton last weekend. Sophomore forward Penelope Hocking dominated the tournament opener, carrying the team with 4 goals and one assist. Her outstanding performance gave her the USC record for points in a single game with 9 and tied the program record for most goals in a game at 4.
Junior forward/midfielder Alea Hyatt also played a key offensive role as she assisted Hocking three times to tie the program record for most assists in a game. Prior to the game, Hyatt was switched from midfield to attack, filling the role of injured junior forward Tara McKeown, who has been phenomenal for the Trojans all year.   
Last season, McKeown played less of an attacking role, but personnel changes this offseason moved her into her more natural position, and it has paid off. Hyatt saw a similar leap in production when she was moved. Before playing Fullerton, she had been quiet statistically, but her outburst now puts her at five assists on the season.   
The decision to move Hyatt was made quite late, and Hocking said she was “surprised” when Hyatt began practicing as a forward. However, the move ended up being for the best. 
“I am glad we had that connection,” Hocking said after the win. 
If McKeown is unable to return against Texas A&M, the Trojans will need someone other than Hocking to step up offensively. Last week, that person was Hyatt, and it could be her time to shine again.
Whoever ends up playing that second forward spot will face a tough Texas A&M defense that has been stellar all season, earning 11 shutouts on the year.  
The 14-4-3 Aggies also took care of business easily in the first round. They took down Texas 4-1 and will have had a week to prepare for anything USC throws at them.
The Aggies played a tough SEC schedule in the regular season. They’ve only lost once to then-No. 8 Arkansas and then-No. 10 BYU and twice to Florida. BYU is now No. 4 while Arkansas maintains the No. 8 spot. In addition, the Aggies knocked off then-No. 13 Santa Clara in their second game of the year. 
The only common opponents that USC and Texas A&M have played are Pepperdine and Florida. USC played significantly better against both opponents while the Aggies struggled against Florida, losing 3-1 and 2-1.  
USC may look to exploit the same weaknesses that Florida did, but last week head coach Keidane McAlpine emphasized that USC needs to stay true to itself to make a deep playoff run. 
Hocking said the team needs to “stay focused” and “stay working together” heading into playoffs. 
“It’s just important that we all work super hard,” Hocking said. “This team is really special.”
Defensively, USC will need to watch out for the offensive prowess of senior forward Ally Watt — who has 15 goals on the season — and junior defender Jimena Lopez, who is dangerous from the backfield with 14 assists.  
Overall, USC should feel comfortable heading into this game. With Hocking on fire and the defense playing well, the Trojans will make a formidable opponent to any team they play for the time being.  
“I think we just realize it’s win or go home,” Hyatt said. “We want another week.”
If USC takes care of business Friday, the winner of No. 20 Santa Clara and No. 13 Oklahoma State will provide a daunting third-round challenge.  
Friday’s game kicks off at 1:30 p.m. at McAlister Field.

Movies have changed a lot in the past few decades. Studio films came to comprise mostly superhero action flicks instead of diverse stories that push the boundaries of filmmaking. While those were also once given bigger budgets, arthouse films today are mostly produced by indie film companies. But among the mainstream Hollywood films that have defined this decade with modern, flashy competition of superheroes and sci-fi fantasies, “Ford v Ferrari,” an old-school underdog that effectively tells a real-life story with artistic flair, emerges as a rare breed of film. 
Led by two powerhouse performances by Matt Damon and Christian Bale, “Ford v Ferrari” retells the classic underdog story — a group of misfits fighting against all odds in a battle with the champions.  
Taking place months before the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car race, “Ford v Ferrari” follows the bitter rivalry between its titular companies. While the Italian Ferrari automotive manufacturer has been leading the entire industry, Americans at Ford were aching to show their company’s true potential on the world stage. That’s when automotive designer and engineer Carroll Shelby (Damon) is hired by Ford to lead a team to defeat Ferrari at the next world championship, the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in France. With only a few months left to defeat the fastest car in the world, Shelby hires the hot-headed yet brilliant race driver Ken Miles (Bale) to pull off the feat. With the highest stakes of their lives, the two men must not only overcome their differences, but also their own internal struggles to have a chance at defeating Ferrari. 
“Ford v Ferrari” establishes itself as one of the strongest biopics in recent memory from its very concept. Sports biopics are not as common as they used to be, making this film even more welcomed and delightful. However, director James Mangold, who directed “Logan” and “Walk the Line,” deliberately never lets the racing details deviate from what’s really important in the film – the characters. 
Without a doubt, the greatest strength of the film is in the chemistry between the dual lead characters, performed masterfully by two of the best actors working today. Both Damon and Bale create an electric interplay with their colorful characters, making the film vastly entertaining. In fact, their own public personas match their respective characters, enhancing each performance. 
Damon’s eye for filmmaking mirrors Shelby’s ability to meticulously plan and strategize, while Bale’s eccentric methods fit perfectly with Miles’ arrogant, perfectionist person. Both of these characters work as great foils for each other: Shelby leads the plot forward, whereas Miles’ relationship with his son (played by rising star Noah Jupe) lends the film its emotional depth. 
From the opening sequence to the final shot, Mangold directs this film with an intent to both entertain the audience and make them emotional invested in the film’s stakes. 
In its technical presentation, the film does not falter in the slightest. The cinematography makes the film one of the most pleasing to watch in the year, even without doing anything too exceptional. When it comes to the racing scenes, Mangold creates some of the most exhilarating sequences of the year with amazing stunts, camerawork and effects. Meanwhile, the film’s editing creates a very engaging rhythm for the story to follow in the two and a half hour runtime. 
In an industry oversaturated with far-fetched blockbusters, it is refreshing to see a grounded story depicting real people overcoming the obstacles life throws at them. And even though the film’s classic optimism is a bit old-fashioned, it reinvigorates the modern cinematic landscape with a nostalgic perspective. “Ford v Ferrari” conveys a universal theme of perseverance that can resonate with anyone in any hardship, making it a relevant, uplifting story.

In A24’s slick coming-of-age crime drama “Hot Summer Nights,” awkward and angsty teen Daniel (Timothée Chalamet) gets caught up with dealing weed in Cape Cod, Mass., in 1991. The film depicts the beginnings of his infatuation with cannabis and details the story of his fleeting business.
In one scene, as Daniel tentatively hits a bong for the first time, experienced stoners observe him with careful yet blank concentration. When he takes the entire hit, one of them raises his hand gently, trying to communicate that the rookie inhaled way too much smoke. Daniel’s eyes widen with alarm as he abruptly stands upright, the camera immediately zooming in to catch his expression.
A montage of cartoons and a shot of severe winds blowing back lines of trees in an orange haze follows an omniscient, premonitory voice narrating cannabis’ effects on the brain. When we return to Daniel, he’s already high as a kite, his eyes instantly drooping as he faints onto the floor, the stoner squad following his descent with their synchronized head tilts.
Light, airy music plays in the background as the camera pans to the former cannabis virgin, his body language and facial features indicative of the euphoria he feels as he mumbles, “Oh my God.” 
The first time I watched the scene, I believed it was absurd, comical and ridiculous. That is not what being high feels like, I thought. But, while dramatized, the depiction is honestly not too far off.
Considering the fact that inhaling a large amount of smoke in one breath can make a person feel faint and that Chalamet’s character has asthma, it’s not too outlandish to think he could be so strongly affected by the bong hit. 
Even more so, highs come in many different forms, especially with various consumption methods. Bong hits are particularly notorious for hitting really hard, really quickly — kind of like a train (but in a good way), a “whoosh” as I call it or, in Daniel’s case, like a wind blowing back some trees.
But what I appreciate most about “Hot Summer Nights” is that it’s a film about weed that offers so much more than most because it avoids cannabis cliches and worn-out tropes.
The best films and television shows, which arguably comprise the pinnacle of American popular culture, play with the idea of the subversive, the deviant and the taboo. Cannabis, along with other drugs, is at the top of the list, with entire movies dedicated to depicting its possession, sale, consumption and cultural impact. 
Weed movies aren’t even that niche or specifically tailored to stoners but rather span genres like comedy, romance, crime and drama. When we look at the prevalence of cannabis depiction in film, it’s interesting to see what this portrayal looks like.
While we’ve come a considerably long way from the bizarre inaccuracy of “Reefer Madness” —  a 1936 propaganda film that depicts weed as a gateway to committing acts of violence — and films like it, it’s not like we’ve exactly transcended far beyond stereotypical representations like the “criminal outcast,” “foolish philosopher” or the “lazy stoner” archetype. 
After “Reefer Madness,” there was a significant 20-year gap between the next generation of stoner movies because of the Motion Picture Production Code, which restricted the showing of drug use on screen.
The 1960s, the counterculture movement brought along with them the revival of stoner movies, which portrayed weed in a considerably different (yet still stereotypical) way, with the iconic duo of Cheech & Chong and their late ’70s comedy film, “Up in Smoke.” 
In the ’90s, stoner comedy films saw an increase in representation, with Black men starring as protagonists in classics like “Half Baked” and “Friday.” However, this was short-lived, as the turn of the century brought a return to played-out, predictable comedies led by white men. Think “The Big Lebowski,” “Dude, Where’s My Car,” “Pineapple Express” and “Ted.”
Let me step back for a second: Far be it from me to call for the end of all comedic depictions of stoners. Most stoner comedies are hilarious, and poking fun at stoners is too easy — what with the poor reaction time and tendency for paranoia. 
I live for the iconic weed circle in “That ’70s Show,” the absurd weed dream scene in “Harold & Kumar go to White Castle,” the strange monologue about George and Martha Washington’s weed habits in “Dazed and Confused” and even the horrible giant cartoon joint in the god-awful “Mac & Devin Go to High School” as much as the next person. 
But I am tired of the boring, repetitive portrayal of the white male protagonist stoner who ends up on a misadventurous journey with an equally unintelligent sidekick because they got high. I’m tired of the lack of representation of women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities in stoner narratives. 
“It became depressingly clear how often films failed to represent the varying identities of smokers by bundling anyone who’s ever enjoyed a joint into the same patronising pile,” writes Charlie Graham-Dixon in Dazed, an English style magazine.
Not only do stoner comedies exclude marginalized identities, they also portray cannabis in the same basic way, without taking into consideration the complexities of pot nor the various reasons why people use it. Where are the stoner dramas where cannabis is used to treat severe illnesses? What about telling the story of the War on Drugs and how Black and brown men are exponentially more likely to be imprisoned for posession than white men? What about stoner comedies led by women of color? What about more documentaries?
Better yet, I want to see films treat cannabis like they now treat alcohol — like a normal thing any person would do. It can be a major plot point, but I’d rather see it depart from that mold. Pot no longer adds a risqué factor to films, and I desperately want Hollywood to do better.
Films like “Dude,” a coming-of-age story about young women in high school and shows like “Broad City,” “High Maintenance” and “Atlanta” have started breaking the mold in unique ways. These shows treat weed seriously, tackling topics like mandatory drug tests and self-medication in ways that are poignant and funny.
At the same time, we have shows like “Weeds” and “Disjointed,” which try to break molds but ultimately fail. While “Weeds” tells the story of a suburban mom who has to sell weed to survive, the show also makes it very clear she does not smoke and is forced into the cannabis business. 
“Disjointed,” a show about a medical dispensary, takes strides for great representation through characters like Travis, who is business-driven, rational and occasionally smokes weed, and Carter, an Iraq veteran and Muslim who uses cannabis to combat his recurring PTSD. But it falls into annoying stereotypes with the portrayal of the absurd, stupid duo Dank and Dabby who (spoiler alert) realize they used to be academic geniuses when they get stuck on a roof deprived of cannabis for many hours.
While we have made leaps over the past several decades, I would venture to say we’re not too far removed from the likes of “Reefer Madness.” Our modern stereotypes are seemingly better and more accurate, but they’re still profoundly ignorant, dangerous and ridiculous. 
Now, more than ever, we need nuanced cultural depictions of weed in television and film. Popular culture drives change, and as legalization efforts sweep across the country, we need more accurate, touching films than stoner comedies can offer. Cannabis has more stories to tell, if we let it.

Theodore Haber, a junior majoring in composition, spends much of his time lost in a world of musical creation.
Haber’s passion for music began at a young age, starting off with a simple red guitar his father gifted him. Noticing his appreciation for music, Haber’s parents enrolled him in ukulele lessons that led him to take an interest in the violin. 
Haber, who attended a music-focused middle school in the Bay Area, was given the opportunity to attend an after-school program that allowed students to compose their own music in seventh grade. Haber continued playing the violin throughout high school but gradually honed in his focus on composition.
“I kind of view a composer as someone who’s shaping an experience for the audience sonically,” Haber said. “A composer has the role of a kind of commentator on what they’re experiencing.” 
As a composer, Haber is in charge of both writing the music and facilitating the audience’s experience through the performance to help them feel whatever it is that the music brings out of them. 
“I recently realized this: Music, for a lot of people, it’s this thing that kind of helps you almost transcend,” Haber said. “For me, the composer’s role is to … guide the listener into that experience.” 
Bradley Bascon, a friend of Haber’s and a junior majoring in violin performance, said Haber is extremely passionate about the music he creates.
“He has a love of music that is unparalleled by few here, and it seems that sometimes all he can talk about is music,” Bascon said. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard him talk about anything else but music.” 
Haber gained experience throughout his musical career as a member of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra and as an active participant in the Yellow Barn Young Artists Program, which trains young composers across the country. He also showcased his talents in the summer workshop for the John Adams Young Composers Program, which cultivates students’ love of creative expression through composition. 
Haber said he is thrilled with his time at USC and thoroughly enjoys performing with the University’s new musical ensemble, Thornton Edge. He emphasized that his major classes provide him with the ability to prosper under the tradition of classical music, while also providing a strong academic footing on which students can improve. 
“USC is honestly one of the top composition programs out there,” Haber said. “In L.A. there’s a very solid kind of contemporary classical music … scene for that, and the faculty here are very much a part of that.” 
Luca Mendoza, a close friend of Haber’s and a junior majoring in composition, said Haber’s enthusiasm for composition inspires both the audience and those he collaborates with. 
“He has a constant thirst for finding different things,” Mendoza said. “We’re gonna make some music that no one else has heard before and blow people’s minds. It’s cool to have somebody else doing that.” 
When constructing any sort of creative work, Haber takes into consideration the “what, how and why” of the piece. In doing so, Haber is able to design musical products that have a narrative arc, facilitating the audience’s emotional experience. 
”USC really does a good job at helping you kind of contextualize that ‘why,’” Haber said. “I feel like the faculty here really cause you to consider what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.”

In recent months, many initiatives led by student governments and faculty members at USC and UCLA have called for increased cooperation between the two universities. One of these initiatives came directly from Emily Carter, UCLA’s executive vice chancellor and provost, who called the two historical rivals to work together to solve key issues.
“The reason I’m back in Southern California and the reason that I decided to take this job is because I think that places like UCLA and USC have a tremendous opportunity to have an outsized impact on the future of cities,” Carter said at the USC Women in Science and Engineering Presidential Distinguished Lecture last month.
And this call makes sense in many ways. USC and UCLA are similar in size, academic standing and location, which, besides being the main causes of their rivalry, can also be a source of cooperation and innovation. Similar environments make for similar issues and therefore call forth similar solutions. 
One of the most pressing issues that both USC and UCLA are trying to tackle is campus sustainability. The issue of sustainability is inherently global. Emitting carbon dioxide is only problematic because too many people all around the world are doing it. However, the way we do it differs by location. Therefore, each cause calls for its own solution. 
It is safe to say that USC and UCLA students have comparable carbon footprints because they live on similar campuses in the same city and share the consumption habits of a typical college student. If we looked for solutions together, we could make great strides in food and transportation sustainability or waste management, for example.
These are all great subjects to collaborate on not only because the issues and context are similar, but also because solving them requires great human capital and financial resources. Solutions are usually found through scientific research and implemented through legislation, which is why USC and UCLA scientists can better work toward their respective schools’ sustainability goals if they agree to research common topics together. Research is often a way for colleges to build prestige and compete with other universities. However, that should not prevail over the issue at hand. 
As world-renowned research institutions standing in the middle of California’s fight against federal environmental policies, USC could emerge as a leader in environmental policymaking for a more sustainable future in America.
At the city level, USC and UCLA can also work together to tackle the main issues affecting their city. Carter said the reason why she accepted her new position was that she thinks that “places like UCLA and USC have a tremendous opportunity to have an outsized impact on the future of cities.” She insisted that both schools can collaborate on “everything from sociology to public health to engineering to the arts and beyond to see whether or not [USC and UCLA] can transform Los Angeles together, in a way that shows the rest of the world how to do that.”
Fortunately, Carol Folt  — an environmental scientist who has reaffirmed her commitment to sustainability and collaboration with other schools during USC’s first-ever zero-waste presidential inauguration — might spearhead the beginning of a new chapter for USC-UCLA relations.
This is especially true considering both schools have set similar sustainability goals which include, among others, supporting environmental research and education, increasing energy conservation and waste diversion towards zero-waste and reducing potable water consumption as well as the use of single-occupancy vehicles.
By collaborating with UCLA, USC could also help UCLA achieve its “Sustainable LA Grand Challenge,” which aims to transition L.A. County to 100% renewable energy, 100% local water and enhanced ecosystem health by 2050. By doing this, both schools could reaffirm their commitment to sustainable practices and public service to the city.
Collaboration between USC and UCLA is worth our consideration. It could not only help us find innovative solutions to environmental issues, but also improve the lives of Angelenos and others throughout the world.

USC men’s basketball came away with a 91-84 win against Pepperdine Tuesday night behind valiant efforts from freshmen forwards Isaiah Mobley and Onyeka Okongwu and senior forward Nick Rakocevic.
The Trojans’ win over the Waves brings them to a 5-0 start to the season. The last time USC was able to pull this off was in 2016 when the team kicked off its season with 14 straight wins.
USC started off the game slowly, shooting 2-7 from deep and giving up six turnovers, which allowed Pepperdine to climb to a 23-14 lead heading into the second media timeout of the contest. Poor overall ball movement and shooting were to blame for this, but the Trojans’ second-half sped up the team’s offense quickly.
“It was a good win against a very good team,” head coach Andy Enfield said after the game. “I thought our guys played hard all night.”
Okongwu led the Trojans with 33 points on the evening and had 21 out of USC’s 34 free-throw attempts, but Waves junior guard Colbey Ross was arguably the game’s most impressive performer. Ross knocked down a career-high 38 points and shot 65% from the field. His efforts kept Pepperdine in the game, especially down the stretch.
Each team shot about as well as the other from the field, from 3-point range and from the line. However, USC was able to edge out a win by earning more rebounds, assists and free throw attempts than Pepperdine.
Enfield and the rest of the Trojans’ coaching staff took advantage of the team’s depth to create a solid all-around win. Redshirt senior guard Quinton Adlesh made just one field goal in 20 minutes, but it was a momentum-boosting 3-pointer to give USC a 32-31 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the first half.
“In practice, we’re a pretty good shooting team,” Enfield said. “We had to take open shots, and at some point, the guys that are supposedly shooters have to make them.”
Mobley’s usage percentage was a game-high 39% despite only playing for a total of 18 minutes. Rakocevic — who was honored before the game alongside senior guard Jonah Mathews for reaching USC’s 1,000 point club — made his first 3-pointer of the season and contributed some efficient passes.
“[Rakocevic] made some really nice passes that led to easy baskets,” Enfield said. “If we can get that productivity out of our three bigs, or even close to it, that would be pretty good.”
Pepperdine only had five total assists compared to the Trojans’ 22. Three of its assists came from Ross, while Rakocevic — who was named Pac-12 Men’s Basketball Player of the Week Monday — led USC with six assists.
On the defensive end, despite Ross’ performance, USC was able to prevent sophomore Pepperdine forward Kessler Edwards from scoring a single point. Coming into Galen Center, Edwards led all Pepperdine players with an average of 17.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game. However, the Rancho Cucamonga native shot 0-7 from the field Tuesday.
Heading into Friday’s game against Temple, USC will have to prepare to face a second opponent that made the NCAA tournament last season. Temple made a First Four appearance before losing to Belmont.
“Our schedule is going to get a little challenging here with Temple coming in,” Enfield said. “We have to come out and defend like we have for most of the season.”
USC will take on a 3-0 Temple squad at Galen Center Friday at 8 p.m. before traveling to the East Coast to take on a 1-4 Fairfield team. Friday’s game will be televised on Pac-12 Network.
