Throughout its history, the Trojans’ storied football program has sent more players to the NFL than all but one other school in the nation. This year, USC has continued to establish itself as a breeding ground for NFL-bound talent, as four Trojans were drafted into the league and one signed as an undrafted free agent.
OT Chuma Edoga
Round 3, Pick 92 Overall 
New York Jets
Chuma Edoga was a full-time starter for two years at USC and appeared in 34 games throughout his college career. Now a Jet, he will reunite with former USC quarterback Sam Darnold in New York. This preseason, Edoga has seen increased action with Darnold and the starting unit due to an injury to starting right tackle Brandon Shell. Edoga’s chemistry with Darnold should help him learn the Jets’ blocking schemes quickly and allow him to communicate effectively throughout his rookie year. Edoga is projected to be a backup offensive tackle and has a chance to see the field this year if the Jets’ offensive line should suffer any injuries. However, he will need to improve his pass protection before becoming a full-time starter in the NFL. 
CB Iman Marshall
Round 4, Pick 127 Overall
Baltimore Ravens 
Iman Marshall was a four-year starter at the cornerback position for USC. As a Trojan, the 6-foot-1 207-pounder was known as a big hitter and never shied away from contact with smaller Pac-12 receivers. In the NFL, he may struggle guarding faster, more disciplined wideouts one-on-one. The Ravens have considered transitioning him to safety, where his physical style and experience as a cornerback should certainly benefit him. Marshall is not projected to have a starting role in Week 1 but will be on the team’s radar throughout the year. Marshall has been sidelined due to injury. 
LB Cameron Smith 
Round 5, Pick 162 Overall 
Minnesota Vikings
The leading tackler for USC’s defense in 2018, Cameron Smith was drafted by the Vikings in the fifth round, joining star linebackers Anthony Barr and Eric Kendricks in Minnesota. Smith is a high-IQ player adept at diagnosing offensive calls and seeking out the ball carrier. His highest tackle total for USC (112) came in 2017, when he played in all 14 games. In his three other seasons as a Trojan, he averaged just over 80 tackles a season. Smith is still battling to make the Vikings’ 53-man roster this year, and it wouldn’t be a shock if he does, but he is unlikely to see significant game action this season. 
CB Marvell Tell III 
Round 6, Pick 144 Overall 
Indianapolis Colts
At USC, Marvell Tell III proved to be a playmaking free safety whose speed could help him make an impact at any level. In his junior year, Tell made 85 tackles and had three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Indianapolis drafted Tell intending to use him as a safety, but teams were wary about taking him due to his smaller stature, believing him unable to be a consistent tackler. Tell earned a spot in Pro Football Focus’ “Team of the Week” after allowing no receptions on two targets and breaking up one pass in the Colts’ preseason opener. He will continue to be a promising prospect that Indianapolis will hope to develop into a contributing corner in the near future.
LB Porter Gustin 
Undrafted Free Agent
New Orleans Saints
At USC, Gustin was a dominant outside linebacker with a knack for getting to the quarterback. However, his injury history and a positive test for Adderall (considered a performance-enhancing drug) at the 2019 NFL combine caused his once-promising draft stock to plummet, and Gustin was not selected. The Saints picked him up hoping to convert him from outside linebacker to defensive lineman. Gustin played defensive end in 2016 for the Trojans and picked up 68 total tackles, 5.5 sacks and four deflected passes. He may have to bulk up for the position change; while his 6’4” stature is average for NFL defensive ends, his weight of 260 lbs would put him at a disadvantage against massive offensive linemen. Gustin has seen valuable action throughout the preseason and tallied a sack and tackle in the Saints’ matchup against the Jets. Gustin is unlikely to see much regular season game action this year.

Like other large universities, one of USC’s pride points is that students come from all walks of life. The boy who grew up on a farm in Idaho takes the same classes as the Fortune 500 CEO’s daughter. College is often the first time young adults experience freedom from their home lives. Inevitably, this freedom comes with greater access to sexual relationships. USC needs to do a better job of educating its students on an important topic: sexual relationships. To bridge this gap, USC should offer a two-unit sex education class to prepare its students for safe and consensual sexual practices. 
Just 24 states mandate sex education courses before students enter college, and only 10 of those states require that the education be medically accurate: California is one of those 10. For this reason, a class like this would surely be incredibly popular. According to Jill Anderson, a writer for Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, sex education is often taught with a focus on abstinence, “despite decades of research showing that this approach results in higher teen pregnancy rates and STDs.” Anderson makes it clear that sexual education is a social issue and a public health issue. The nation’s sexual education is failing its students, but USC can rectify those gaps in learning. 
Navigating sex as a young person can come with triumphs, but it almost definitely comes with tribulations. Many of these misunderstandings could be mitigated with a thorough sex education. For example, it could help the young man who thought putting two condoms on would make sex extra safe. Or the girl who did not know that antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of birth control. Don’t forget the young men who have no idea how menstruation works. These are all issues a comprehensive sex education course could address. 
Planned Parenthood describes comprehensive sex education as that which discusses human development, relationships, personal skills, sexual behaviors, sexual health, society and culture. A two-unit course could easily cover this ground. A room full of adults should be able to learn about sex without judgment. These are not lewd, saucy topics; they are important matters of health and personal relationships. 
Consent is an essential part of sex education. Sexual assault has come up again and again on campus — former gynecologist George Tyndall allegedly sexually assaulted hundreds of USC students and former men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly is accused of sexually abusing several gay and bisexual men.  The University needs to set the record straight for its students on what consent means. 
The rise of the #MeToo movement makes clear this issue isn’t confined to USC —  America is failing to teach consent. In the safe haven of a classroom, students can explore the concept of consent and set the record straight. It is important to learn how to give, understand and ask for consent because it can seem awkward and not instinctual. Consent is non-negotiable for a healthy sexual life, and everyone should formally be taught how to navigate it. 
USC’s peer institutions have had sex-ed courses become successful. UC Berkeley has a sex-ed course called “Sex 101: Topics in Sexual Health” that students have to apply to because of its popularity. The class was created “to achieve this goal of providing sexual health education and services on campus.” 	
USC could house this course under the Department of Biological Sciences, Biology department or the Gender and Sexuality Studies department. Sex education is a vital aspect of personal health and well-being, and USC is free from state laws that might prevent them from constructing a comprehensive, genuinely informative sex-ed class. It’s USC’s responsibility to prepare its students for the world, and sex education is an irrefutable part of preparing for a successful adult life.

Sophomore quarterback JT Daniels will be USC football’s starting quarterback Saturday against Fresno State, head coach Clay Helton announced Aug. 20. The decision, long awaited but not unexpected, came after months of competition.
After a 2018 season in which Daniels led the Trojans to a paltry 5-7 record, Helton made it clear that the starting job was not simply handed to the young quarterback. 
“We came into the process and said it’s not going to be about age or who’s been on the field,” Helton said. “It’s going to be about how people play and how people compete on a day-to-day basis and execute the offense and how they do it consistently. JT did that.”
Daniels returns to the starting job as one of USC’s most scrutinized players. After being named the 2017 Gatorade National Player of the Year as a junior at perennial power Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Daniels left high school a year early and was named the Trojans’ starting signal-caller a week before the team’s 2018 season opener. 
Daniels’ first year behind center was inconsistent but showcased his raw talent. As a freshman, he threw for 2,672 yards and 14 touchdowns in 11 games while offering occasional flashes of brilliance. 
This year, the sophomore got the nod from Helton marginally earlier, just two weeks before USC’s first game. According to Helton and offensive coordinator Graham Harrell, Daniels put forth the most consistent performance throughout fall camp. 
Daniels is a prototypical pocket passer with the ability to put touch on the ball and fit it into tight windows. Still, the young quarterback is not resting on his laurels. 
“I’ve made a big emphasis on pocket movement and just pocket mobility in general,” Daniels said. “I’d definitely say that was a big focus. Just moving through progressions faster [and] a big emphasis on taking no sacks.”
While many fans speculated that Daniels would ultimately earn the starting job, the announcement of freshman Kedon Slovis as his backup was unexpected. 
“We were very surprised with Kedon coming out of the spring, very impressed,” Helton said. “We went through this camp and another 15 practices to see if it wasn’t just spring. He did it again.”
Slovis was an unheralded three-star recruit out of Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. The freshman enrolled early at USC last semester to participate in spring practices. Since arriving, Slovis’s ability to make tough throws has made a lasting impression on the coaching staff. 
“Kedon’s a special talent. Talent-wise, he’s as good as I’ve ever seen,” Harrell said. “Kedon can make some throws that other people can’t make.”
Redshirt junior Matt Fink and redshirt sophomore Jack Sears round out the rest of the depth chart behind Slovis at three and four. 
Fink returns for his fourth season at USC after nearly leaving the program. He entered the transfer portal in April after it was reported that he was discouraged with his starting prospects following a meeting with Helton. 
Fink’s father told the Los Angeles Times in May that his son would be transferring to the University of Illinois. Fink quickly shut down his father’s claim and announced in June that he would remain with the Trojans. 
Over the course of seven games played in relief of either Sam Darnold or Daniels, Fink completed 72% of his passes and rushed for 106 yards. The veteran is accurate on short to intermediate routes and possesses underrated athleticism.
Sears is returning for his third year as a Trojan. He started one game last season after Daniels and Fink were sidelined with a concussion and broken ribs, respectively. 
Sears performed admirably in the only start of his career, completing 20 of 28 passes for 235 yards and two touchdowns in a narrow loss to Arizona State. 
USC’s quarterback competition began in the spring and extended over 30 practices. The coaching staff remained committed to a democratic process throughout fall camp. All four quarterbacks received an equal amount of reps at practice and split time between the first- and second-team offenses. 
According to Daniels, the competition brought out the best in himself and the rest of the team.
“Having Kedon in there everyday, having Fink play great [and] having Sears play great definitely pushes you to make sure you’re on yourself,” Daniels said.
After facing many critics as the battle for the starting job carried on for weeks, reporters asked Daniels whether or not he felt he finally had an opportunity to prove his detractors wrong.
“I’m not excited to go out there to prove them wrong,” Daniels said. “I’m just excited to play football.”
Daniels and the Trojans will get the opportunity to do just that when they kick off against Fresno State Saturday at 7:30 p.m.

The 2020 Democratic primaries are just around the corner, and college students are one of the largest target groups for the candidates competing for the nomination. Candidates know that if they can energize liberal college students to come out to the polls, they can counter the older, conservative-leaning citizens who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. 
The candidates are speaking directly to college students by revealing plans to ease them out of student debt. While more than a handful of candidates are talking about free public education, some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have gone on the record promising students that the government would repay anywhere from part of to the full amount of their existing student loans. 
These are short-term solutions designed to gain popularity points among students — who would gladly take free money — and win an election rather than do what is best for the country and its students.  
Put aside the tremendous cost and economic strain that would inevitably occur should the government truly pay back the banks with interest; forgiving student debt simply will do nothing to address how unaffordable a college education has become. It will exacerbate costs, causing private colleges and banks to applaud in greedy approval. Government repayment of student debt will incentivize colleges and universities to continue to raise tuition because that tuition’s payment will be guaranteed and incentivize private banks to give out more loans at a higher interest rate because the repayment risk will be minimized.
Sending someone to college for four years who is not ready for such a step and letting them graduate with an unhirable degree or a weak transcript puts that person in a worse position than they were before. Instead of entering the workforce directly after high school and beginning to earn money, that person now has accumulated four years of debt without working full-time. Repaying that person’s student debt does not solve the problem. 
Take Warren’s plan to repay $50,000 in student debt for everyone with a household income less than $250,000. Instead of putting that person in financial strain because of student loans, the government should incentivize them to find a job without going to college, perhaps by encouraging more affordable vocational schools and associates degrees and fighting the rising depletion of manual labor jobs due to automation. It would save both the individual and the government tremendous amounts of money. That person would also contribute to the economy instead of hindering it. 
Sanders’ plan is even more problematic. In June, he proposed wiping away all student debt for 44 million borrowers, regardless of household income. Not only does this give an enormous break for the wealthy — something he has spent his whole career advocating against — it goes against the very principle of contributing to the economy as opposed to taking from it. 
Repaying all loans regardless of profession and public service is not fair to those who have dedicated their lives to low-paying jobs that directly serve the country. Take, for example, the lawyer who dedicated her life to public service — and is sustained by public interest loan forgiveness — while she is drowning in $200,000 debt and earning under $60,000. Or the ROTC students who committed to four years of active military service and additional years on the reserves in exchange for a fully-funded college education. Certainly, not everyone should receive the same benefits as them. 
John F. Kennedy, former leader of the Democratic Party, said in his inaugural address, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” College graduates can either demand their country pay back their bills, or they can actively invest their labor in the country in exchange for private benefits from the government. 
The rising cost of college tuition is problematic. It financially restrains graduates from getting married, having kids and maintaining their inalienable right to pursue happiness. Promising to repay thousands of dollars in loans with no questions asked is not the right solution. FAFSA and private college financial aid need to be revamped before the government promises to hand out money. Repaying loans should be the final step after a system is in place that ensures people can afford college without taking on tremendous amount of debt to begin with. 
Presidential candidates who come up with creative solutions to tackle the root of the problem — the sticker-price cost of college — will appeal both to college students and graduates who have already paid off their loans.

The Fall semester is upon us, which means students will soon find themselves deep in the throngs of tedious lectures, enraging assignments and horrific all-nighters. Fortunately for all, The Suspenders, USC’s premier sketch comedy troupe, will be around to provide some relief — comic relief that is.
The Suspenders, founded in Spring 2014 by alumni Mark Rozenweig and Dom Bournes, does not do improv. Though often confused as such, sketch comedy is a form of scripted comedy in which performers act out a series of short pre-written sketches on stage, the prime example being NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” 
The troupe primarily spends its time preparing its own sketch comedy show performed at the end of each semester. In previous years, the show was performed at USC’s Massman Theater with themes ranging from “Debauchery Drive” — a parody of “Sesame Street” — to an “Awkward Prom Night.” 
Preparation for the show begins with writing. According to Evan Macedo, the artistic director of the troupe, writing workshops are held twice a week for nearly half the semester. During this phase, writers and performers brainstorm sketch ideas, ranging from open mics in East Berlin to tone-deaf USC students. After multiple rounds of table reads, sketches are finally selected and rehearsals begin.
Macedo, a senior majoring in theater, auditioned for The Suspenders during his first semester at USC. After performing with the troupe for a couple of years, he eventually rose to his current position, where he runs rehearsals and directs sketches. 
“[The best part is] getting to help someone’s sketch come to fruition and make it as good as possible,” Macedo said. “Helping everyone write to their fullest potential and act to their fullest potential is something I’m very excited to work on with everyone.” 
Macedo runs The Suspenders with Taylor Rivers, a senior majoring in theater, who serves as the troupe’s technical director. As technical director, Rivers directs lights, manages the stage and works to ensure that Macedo’s vision is executed.
“[The troupe] showed me in particular what my strengths and weaknesses were,” Rivers said. “[It] allowed me a place to be wild in my writing and experimental in my acting, and through that I found my voice.”
Macedo also credits The Suspenders with personal and artistic growth. 
“I can say that we both have grown a lot as artists, just from getting notes every week about our writing and seeing what works in shows and what doesn’t,” Macedo said. “I credit a lot of who I am today as an artist to The Suspenders.”
Outside of the troupe, Macedo serves as the voice of Ander on the Netflix original series “Elite.” Rivers is a published poet and professional lighting designer. However, they’re not the only Suspenders members doing big things. 
Several Suspenders alumni work at United Talent Agency and Creative Artists Agency, the top two talent agencies in the country. Many continue to write and act, and some, like Rozenweig, have even gone on to found their own production companies, Macedo said.
Aside from providing laughs, The Suspenders also pride themselves on having a diverse cast. Troupe members come from a host of academic backgrounds, including business administration and dentistry, Rivers said. The troupe places a particular emphasis on diversity, especially because the field has largely been dominated by white actors. 
“We are very diverse in our genetic makeup as well, whereas a lot of comedy troupes I think have the reputation of just being straight white men,” Macedo said. “The past two presidents have been an African American woman and a Latina woman. We did a sketch where we had Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker [in] a Rush Hour Parody. We pride ourselves on being able to do that because we have a very eclectic group.” 
Though many of the troupe’s members come from film and theater backgrounds, Macedo and Rivers hope students from a host of different majors and minors aren’t deterred from giving the troupe a try. 
“[We look for] people who are wacky and unafraid to be weird, people who have a range of characters, and people that are fun to work with” Macedo said.
Auditions will be held Sept. 9 and 10. Performers will be asked to perform pre-prepared monologues released during the second week of classes. Writers will be asked to submit two sketches and a writing supplement. 
“The Suspenders is great for people that want to take control of the art they make, people who like comedy and community” Macedo said. “It’s a great opportunity to learn from people who are going to be in this industry.”

Shortly after Carol Folt was named USC’s 12th president in March, she conducted an interview with National Public Radio. There, she drew attention to diversity as a priority for USC and for herself. 
“We want to get the best students from all walks of life, irrespective of their socioeconomic status,” Folt told NPR.
One such pipeline USC has created to allow students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to attend the University is its Tuition Assistance Benefit program. The program currently allows children of employees who are admitted to attend USC 100% tuition-free and spouses at a 25% to 50% discount. Furthermore, those eligible for Tuition Assistance also qualify for the Tuition Exchange Competitive Scholarship, which allows students to apply for scholarships to a select number of USC’s peer institutions that would greatly reduce their cost of attendance. 
Even though this University program is one of “the University’s most appreciated benefits,” according to its employee directory, it leaves an important group out.
Since 2001, USC has subcontracted its custodial services through a company called Aramark. These subcontracted employees, mostly custodians, are an integral part of the USC experience. However, these employees are not considered “full-time, actively at work benefits-eligible staff employed by the University,” meaning that their children are not eligible for the program.
The University can help create pipelines for socioeconomic diversity at USC and serve employees necessary to the University’s daily function by including Aramark employees, their children and spouses in the program.
In 2018, USC custodians, students and faculty carried out demonstrations calling for higher wages and better accommodations from Aramark. Their efforts resulted in a $2.35 rate increase over the course of four years, amounting to $15.50 per hour by 2021. Over 200 families received this minimally improved contract, and if USC’s Tuition Assistance Benefit program were to get implemented, these families would generationally benefit from open access to postsecondary education, creating lasting impact by allowing their employees’ families to become socially mobile.
Two hundred families might seem like a small number compared to the scope of students, faculty and staff in the Trojan Family. However, when Aramark employees are treated as second-class employees at USC, the University makes it clear that some of its hardest working employees aren’t part of that family.
Moreover, the majority of Aramark employees at USC come from Black and Latino communities in Los Angeles — communities historically underrepresented at the college level. Racial minorities often face major barriers to entry to opportunities like higher education, keeping schools like USC predominantly white. By easing Aramark employees’ access to postsecondary education, USC can help build lanes of access to achieve both socioeconomic and racial equity at the higher education level. 
It’s become clear that success in the American economy is dependent on workers possessing increasing levels of knowledge, skills and abilities — ones best acquired through higher education. As a result, USC can provide a stimulus for families who couldn’t otherwise afford a college degree and help close the growing opportunity gap present in modern-day America. 
A 2013 New York Times study  found that USC students’ median family income was $161,400 and that 63% of students came from the top 20% of household incomes in America. While education is considered the road to a better life, its high cost makes it something that is largely inaccessible for lower income families. USC must use its power as an elite higher education institution to create a new ladder of opportunity while expanding its own diversity initiatives. 
For USC to acknowledge the needs of its subcontracted custodial staff would be a reparative recognition and a promise of affordability, commitment and open access for some of the University’s most important and undervalued employees.
Folt has the opportunity to take a step back and become a leader in fostering lasting change in modern education.

There’s a lot of content out there. Finding the best media to pass the time can become a bit overwhelming. To help you separate must-see media from casual, second-screen viewing, the Daily Trojan spoke to students at the School of Cinematic Arts, one from each of its six undergraduate programs, and asked which media from this year were truly “essential.” 
“Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse”
“By far, my favorite [film] to come out of animation last year was ‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,’ and I say this as someone who really dislikes superhero movies. In an age where 3-D animation dominates the animation industry, stylistic animation has been rare, as studios tend to lean toward realism in CG. This has culminated in most CG movies having almost the exact same look, regardless of studio. I loved ‘Spider-Verse’ so much because it was such a drastic departure from the conventions of 3-D animation. Instead of striving for realism, ‘Spider-Verse’ did the opposite: they made the movie look like a living, breathing comic book. By using graphic shading, animating on 12 frames per second and incorporating many hand drawn elements into the movie, ‘Spider-Verse’ differentiated itself from the hyper-realism of most CG movies. With its success, it will hopefully open the door for more experimentation in the styles of 3-D animation!” 
– Meg Howes, junior, animation & digital arts 
“Euphoria”
“The reason ‘Euphoria’ should be the priority on anyone’s TV watchlist this year is simple: It is a show about teenagers for everyone. It captures the isolation felt by a generation raised on the internet [and] the disconnect between teenagers and their elders as a result of their parents’ inability to understand the very ‘adult’ problems they face nowadays. The ensemble of characters struggle with their own uniquely mature problems, and the show in no way sugarcoats them. Body image, sex work, domestic abuse, toxic masculinity and addiction are all heavy themes — a television show [touching] upon them in its first eight episodes, especially under the umbrella of adolescence, is ballsy. While shows targeted at and centered around teens in the past have also dealt with similar themes, very few have been as graphic and up-close-and-personal as ‘Euphoria.’ The incredible script and powerhouse cast devoid of weak links, combined with a colorful soundtrack, unique cinematography and thought-provoking artistic direction, make ‘Euphoria’ one of the coolest and most innovative new TV shows for young people in recent years.”
– Krupa Naik, junior, cinema & media studies
“Climax”
“Mind you, I have never actually seen this movie in English, but I did not need to understand all of the words for ‘Climax,’ the newest movie from director Gaspar Noé, to be one of the most memorable movies I’ve seen recently. The plot is extremely simple: A French dance troupe gathers in a remote building to rehearse and celebrate, someone spikes their drinks with LSD and things go very poorly. What unfolds is some of the most beautifully shot dance and terribly disturbing horror sequences imaginable. Noé’s bass-heavy 80/90s dance music soundtrack and mesmerizing ‘ghost train’ camera work makes ‘Climax’ something to be experienced, not watched. The movie’s prevalent use of improvisation allows the characters and their relationships to feel organic even as their perceptions become further and further distorted ‘Climax’ does what the greatest horror does — reveal something about the monsters lurking within everyday people.”
– Luke Greenwood, sophomore, media arts & practice
“Hypnospace Outlaw”
“I only recently played Hypnospace Outlaw for the first time. [However], I know that [it won’t be my] last. There’s so much to do in this seemingly simple simulation. You play as a member of the Hypnospace Patrol Department, making sure those who visit certain sites are behaving within the Hypnospace guidelines. The game is visually captivating, [parodying] the internet in the 90s so your screen is going to be a jumble of neon colors, Comic Sans font and weird pixel art drawings at any given moment. The music and sound effects also help magnify the setting and made me feel like I was playing on an early PC, not my gaming laptop. The puzzles and objectives require more attention and increase in complexity as the game continues. When I finished these puzzles, I felt such a strong sense of gratification. This game is fun, captivating and hilarious. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone.”
– Mattie Rosen, junior, interactive entertainment
“Fleabag”
“The first season of ‘Fleabag’ was about as perfect as a season of television can be, but the second season is just gorgeous. While Season 1 gave us the story of a woman continually contributing to her own destruction, Season 2 is about that same woman making an effort to change for the better. Ultimately, this is how ‘Fleabag’ elevates itself above other dark comedies of its ilk — it pays off its own fourth wall-breaking style in a way that feels authentic to its main character, and ultimately to her character growth. ‘Fleabag’ talks directly to us, the audience, to avoid connecting with other people [which] is what makes the final shot of the series so stunningly powerful. I have a thousand things to say about the way Phoebe Waller-Bridge writes characters, formulates jokes and expresses the unique pain and pleasure of womanhood, but it would probably be faster to just watch the show.”
– Hannah Cesleski, senior, writing for film & television
“Midsommar”
“My must-see film for 2019 is Ari Aster’s ‘Midsommar’. Coming off his 2018 instant classic, ‘Hereditary’, Aster takes us into a world that is a polar opposite to any I have ever seen depicted in the horror genre … It is almost entirely set during the daytime under the gaze of the sun. Very few horror films have taken on this challenge. Having horror play out when everything is visible to the eye is no piece of cake. The lack of light in dark spaces, whether that be indoors or outdoors, is a tool that the majority of horror films rely on for the purposes of creating jump scares. ‘Midsommar,’ however, shows us the horror of what this town does to people without trying to make us jump. In this way, the film is much more disturbing and discomforting because it is so graphic and visible. After nearly 2.5 hours I came out of the theater with this sick feeling in my stomach. My reality seemed off. Aster’s collaborations with his cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, and his production designer, Henrik Svensson, are highlighted with the architecture and design of the village and [its] shot compositions. Even if horror is not your favorite genre, I recommend seeing ‘Midsommar’ to observe Aster’s masterful control over the audience. ‘Midsommar’ is not just a film, but an experience — an experience that has to be witnessed in the movie theater.”
– Graham Byers, sophomore, film & television production

Matthew Olson, an incoming freshman from Corona del Mar High School, died Saturday in a traffic collision. He was 18.  
Olson was struck by a vehicle travelling south on the I-110 freeway near 37th Street while he was walking in the FasTrak lanes shortly before 2:45 a.m. Saturday. He was then struck by a second vehicle. Though the first driver stopped to help Olson, the second vehicle drove away, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics pronounced Olson dead on the scene. The CHP, which is investigating the incident, said it doesn’t know why Olson was walking in the FasTrak lanes at the time of the collision. Police have arrested the driver of the first vehicle and are still searching for the operator of the second one. 
Olson was matriculated to study business administration at the Marshall School of Business after graduating from Corona del Mar High School this past spring. 
He played on Corona del Mar’s 2018 National Championship volleyball team and earned a Coach’s Award for Hardest Working Player. In high school, Olson was also a member of Future Business Leaders of America and the Best Buddies program, where he volunteered with people with disabilities, President Carol Folt said in an email to the USC community. 
“[Matthew] was the consummate teammate, always looking out for the interests of his friends and teammates before his own.” Corona del Mar volleyball coach Ryan Schachter wrote in a statement emailed to the Daily Trojan. “His legacy is much more than his incredible achievements in the classroom or in the athletic arena, he was a genuinely kind person and those who were fortunate to have known Matt are much better for it.”
Corona del Mar principal Kathy Scott said the high school has resources available for students and staff affected by Olson’s death.
“We understand that a loss like this can be traumatic and that everyone grieves differently,” Scott wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Folt and Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp sent a memo to the University community Monday expressing condolences for Olson’s family and friends. The University also offered counseling services to students, faculty and staff through the USC Counseling Center. 
“Whatever your circumstances and wherever this new semester may take you, we ask that you please keep Matt and his family in your thoughts and prayers,” Folt and Crisp wrote. 
Folt wrote in her email that the University will inform students of memorial plans as information becomes available.
