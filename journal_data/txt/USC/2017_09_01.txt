With a sly smile and reserved demeanor, redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns is excited for the opportunity to make his presence felt. When asked whether or not he was ready to make his debut against the Western Michigan Broncos in the historic Los Angeles Coliseum, Vaughns couldn’t hold back his smile.
“Yeah,” he grinned. “I’m really excited.”
You would be, too, if you were Vaughns. He’s waited a year for his chance to shine in the spotlight. Like JuJu Smith-Schuster, Nelson Agholor, Marqise Lee and plenty more before him, Vaughns hopes to be the next USC receiver to break out and make a name for himself. Following an excellent spring and fall camp, Vaughns looks like he’s ready to make the jump. 
But it didn’t happen overnight. 
Coming from Bishop Amat High School, just a little over 20 miles away from the USC campus, Vaughns was seen by some as one of the top five receivers in the country when he was a high school senior. Vaughns has always had the physical talent. In his final season of high school, Reign of Troy writer Alicia de Artola described him as having “glue-like hands.” But the jump from high school to college was a big one. 
While he had always stood out on the field growing up, Vaughns struggled to set himself apart from his teammates for the first time in his football career. Vaughns was redshirted his freshman season at USC. However, it was a humbling experience for him, and he says he’s better because of it. 
“It really helped me in terms of knowing the game, knowing the playbook and all that,” Vaughns said. “So I’ll never take that year for granted. I worked my butt off. I was going against Adoree’ Jackson and [junior] Biggie [Marshall] everyday. So every day it was work. It wasn’t ever like ‘I’m a redshirt so I can just take it easy and chill.’ No it was business. It was a really good year for me.”
As the Trojans prepared to play Penn State in a Rose Bowl for the record books, Vaughns studied the play books. As a redshirt, his role remained on the sidelines in the heart-stopping victory over Penn State. 
“During the bowl practices last year, I was up in [offensive coordinator Tee Martin’s] office going over the defenses,” Vaughns said. “I couldn’t recognize any of it. He’d quiz me on it, I’d go in and write it on his board or he’d give me a packet of routes to draw up.” 
The learning curve was steep, but after spending time learning the X’s and O’s, the lightbulb turned on and the game has slowed down. Before, he was unfamiliar with the plays, taking his routes slow to avoid mistakes. Now, Vaughns is ready to go full speed.
With an offseason full of hype around redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, one storyline of interest going into spring and fall camp was who would emerge as the big receiving threats for the Heisman candidate this season’s squad. And in a room full of talented athletes, Vaughns has stood out.
“Sometimes it looks like [Sam Darnold]’s just gliding out there and just kind of floating,” Martin said. “He gets open for the quarterback. He just has a knack for doing those types of things. I think it’s special, it’s unique.” 
As for any personal goals ahead of the 2017 campaign, Vaughns has one: to start. He currently trails behind Jalen Greene in the depth chart, but Vaughns is determined that by the end of the season, that will have changed.
“He’s playing so much more confident right now,” Martin said. “He’s gotten bigger and stronger in the weight room. He knows what to do now so he’s playing bigger and faster and now you can see his skill set. Very smooth, great route runner, catch radius. He’s just a football player.” 
As Trojan fans make their way into the Coliseum on Saturday, fans won’t be the only ones ready to start the season. After putting in the work, Vaughns will be a player to watch from now on, and he’s just as excited as anyone to see if this year will be his breakout season. 
While the team had a remarkable season last year, he and the Trojans are hungrier for more. And this time around, Vaughns hopes he’ll be the one making the big play instead of watching history from the sideline.

The No. 7 women’s soccer team will be well-rested for its second match of the season against Missouri on Friday, as it’s been 14 days since they beat UC Davis in their season opener. 
While the Trojans spent their recess on the practice field, the Tigers competed in four matches. Mizzou opened the 2017 season with two wins, although the outcome of their four-game stretch left the Tigers with a 2-1-1 record heading into Friday. Their most recent match — Sunday against No. 14 Nebraska ­— was the Tigers’ only matchup this season in which they played a ranked team. The result was favorable for the Trojans, as Mizzou fell 3-0 to the Cornhuskers. Nebraska dominated in shots, similar to how the Trojans outshot UC Davis two weeks ago.
Mizzou was only able to put two shots on the Cornhuskers’ goal. On the other side of the field, the Tigers’ goalkeepers — junior Kelsey Dossey and redshirt senior Kristen Rivers — have split playing time in every game this season. They have earned two shutouts this year, but faced a low volume of shots on goal in each game. 
For the Trojans, shots on goal were not a problem against UC Davis. Two weeks ago, head coach Keidane McAlpine noted that his team paid special attention to their offensive game in practice and were able to show that off against UC Davis with a 2-1 victory. However, McAlpine went on to say that his team needs to apply pressure for the entirety of the game. 
In addition, USC also must pay attention to their back line. McAlpine was not satisfied with the Trojans’ defense against the Aggies. 
The defense is led by junior defender Ally Prisock, who played a key role in last year’s national championship victory. Prisock started all 25 games last year and played a total of 2,277 minutes — the second most on the team. Moreover, she was selected to the 2015 PAC-12 All-Freshman team. McAlpine stated the importance of the center back leading the team and thinks Prisock fits the role. 
“She’s on the watch list, she’s had the most experience, she’s started the most games, and she was a part of that defense that was so special,” McAlpine said. “So it’s on her and she catches it.” 
Finally, the Trojans need to capitalize on their scoring opportunities. So far, the Trojans have been able to put a lot of shots on goal but few have reached the back of the net.
The defending national champion Trojans were ranked No. 3 before their match against UC Davis on Aug. 18. Due to being idle, the Trojans fell to No. 7, but with three matches in the next week, they will look to catch up to other teams in volume of games and will most likely move back up in the rankings.

We’re finally here. Let’s pat ourselves on the back and trade a few clichés about “surviving the offseason” or getting Christmas in September. Fans always cherish opening week, especially in a sport like football that makes us wait eight months between campaigns. Everyone loves a fresh start, and as the tired phrase goes, all teams believe it’s their year on Week One.
The excitement that engulfed this campus after the Trojans’ Rose Bowl victory hasn’t subsided — if anything, the summer months built the hype up to a fever pitch. But as I re-watched USC’s 2016 season on repeat all year (the Pac-12 Network has been running all the games nonstop since January), I realized this fall doesn’t feel like a fresh start, per se. It feels more like an encore.
That’s not a mentality Trojan fans are used to as of late. Most season openers in recent memory have presented the opportunity to turn over a new leaf at USC after a disappointing previous campaign. When was the last time an opening-day crowd filed into the Coliseum still riding the high of the year before — and expecting even more?
This optimism stems largely from the return of redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, the preseason Heisman favorite. He saved the Trojans’ 2016 season, and we are running out of superlatives to praise him. Having said that, this USC squad as a whole is chock-full of talent, with multiple national award contenders on both sides of the ball. Without significant contributions from players like junior cornerback Iman Marshall and junior linebacker Cameron Smith, the Trojans won’t go anywhere, no matter what Darnold does.
Fortunately, Darnold and the rest of the team know this — despite the media’s single-minded obsession with the potential No. 1 overall pick in next year’s NFL Draft. During Pac-12 Media Days in July, a throng of reporters gathered around Darnold, peppering him with questions about his game and about adjusting to the limelight. Someone asked if he had a secret weapon on offense.
“You guys know about RoJo [junior running back Ronald Jones II], right?” Darnold laughed. “We’re looking to have a balanced attack this year … If we can run the ball, we’re going to have success throwing it.”
Darnold’s mentality reflects USC’s greatest strength this year — because head coach Clay Helton loves to establish the ground game and Darnold relishes spreading the ball around, it’s difficult for opponents to key in on a specific Trojan threat. Jones was a 1,000-yard rusher last fall; redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe has emerged as a deadly threat in the red zone; junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett reeled in 56 receptions for 622 yards and caught seven touchdowns as a sophomore — including three scores against Penn State last January. 
To add another cliché, it has become about the team, not the players. It’s a far cry from just two years ago, when Cody Kessler force-fed JuJu Smith-Schuster 1,454 yards, with no other receiver on the team even reaching 500 receiving yards for the season (Adoree’ Jackson — a natural cornerback — had the second most on the team with 414).
Of course, USC will undoubtedly miss NFL draftees Jackson and Smith-Schuster this season: The duo turned in three stalwart campaigns during a turbulent era of Trojan football program that saw leadership changes in both positions of head coach and athletic director. 
Despite the odds, they delivered an iconic Rose Bowl win to cap their college careers. But it’s time for the next generation to spur the program to even greater heights — the heights Jackson, Smith-Schuster and every other recruit dreams of when he signs with the Trojans.
That climb begins this weekend, as Western Michigan visits the Coliseum to open the season. The Broncos enjoyed the best season in program history in 2016, but they have lost the services of former head coach P.J. Fleck, who jumped at the chance to coach in a Power Five conference and took the reins at Minnesota. 
Quarterback Zach Terrell, the school’s all-time leading passer, graduated, and wideout Corey Davis was drafted in the first round of the last NFL Draft. Unlike the Trojans, WMU has been forced into pushing the reset button.
It’s a fortunate break for Helton’s squad. If the defending MAC champions still had their superstar trio, they would have almost certainly begun the year in the top 25, and USC would have had three consecutive games against ranked opposition to open the season. Not to say that the Broncos will be a cakewalk, but their weakened roster will be a relief to Trojan fans, considering most other Pac-12 teams square off against the likes of Rutgers and New Mexico State this week.
However, unless the Trojans take a shocking loss, no questions will be answered on Saturday. If USC suffers an upset, the team’s lofty preseason dreams could very well go out the window on day one. And if Darnold and company trample the Broncos, it will just mean the first win of many needed over the course of the fall. 
As much optimism and excitement surrounds this program, there is an equal amount of paranoia. But that’s how you know your team is good — and that’s how you know football season is finally here.

Saturday’s season opener will mark the first time in program history that USC has ever faced a team from the Mid-American Conference. Western Michigan finished last season 13-1 and as MAC Champions for the first time since 1988. They also made an appearance in the Cotton Bowl this January, where they lost to Wisconsin by eight points. 
The Broncos suffered several key departures from last season, but also have several key pieces remaining. The most noticeable difference is at the head coaching position. For the last five years, the Broncos were coached by P.J. Fleck, the youngest head coach in Division I football. Fleck’s energy and ability to recruit top players were vital factors in the Broncos’ rise. Fleck took WMU from the bottom of the MAC to the Cotton Bowl in five years. He singlehandedly changed the culture of  both the team and Western Michigan University before leaving to the Big Ten to coach Minnesota.
With Fleck exiting, WMU alum Tim Lester steps in. Lester is a former Western Michigan quarterback himself, finishing his college career then ranked fourth all-time in passing yards and sixth in touchdowns. He also set 17 WMU and MAC records as a Bronco. Lester has been coaching college football since 2004, including a stint at Western Michigan, but his most recent coaching position was at Purdue University in 2015.
Lester is focused on making the program his own in a variety of ways. He made waves by choosing not to name any captains of the team for this season, instead allowing team leaders to naturally emerge and picking players for the coin toss on a game-by-game basis.
“I know the captain thing is a big deal, but the way I’ve done it is that I don’t feel like four people is enough leaders on the team,” Lester said in a press conference. “Four people to lead 103 doesn’t make any sense to me. We have a leadership group of 20 guys, and we’ll rotate captains every week.”
Offensively, the Broncos lost arguably the best wide receiver in college football last season in Corey Davis. Davis finished his WMU career with 5,278 yards, making him the Football Bowl Subdivision all-time leader in receiving yards. He was drafted fifth overall by the Tennessee Titans. Along with Davis, the Broncos also lost starting right tackle and second-round draft pick Taylor Moton and WMU’s all-time leading passer in quarterback Zach Terrell. The quarterback position will be filled by redshirt sophomore Jon Wassink, who led his high school to two state championships before committing to Western Michigan. 
“I have a lot of experience playing young quarterbacks,” Lester said. “You have to play defense and run the ball to keep them out of bad situations, so there is a lot our team can do to help Jon. I don’t think he’ll let his nerves get in the way, but the thing for him will be the speed. The speed of the game the first time you go out there is unlike anything you’re ever used to.”
The Broncos will undoubtedly have to replace a lot of firepower on offense if they plan to remain amongst the top offenses in the MAC. They’ll do so with three returning offensive linemen. Behind those returning linemen are two of the best runners in the MAC, Jarvion Franklin and Jamauri Bogan. Franklin finished last season with 1,353 yards rushing, while Bogan finished with 923 yards. Both yardage totals ranked in the top six rushing totals in the MAC last season. 
The main departure for the Broncos on the defensive end was Keion Adams. Adams was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the seventh round of this year’s NFL Draft after being a key piece in WMU’s 13-1 season last year. Even with that loss, the Broncos still return cornerback Darius Phillips, last year’s conference leader in interceptions and kickoff return yards. 
After leaving the team for a short period this summer, starting linebacker and leading tackler Robert Spillane also returns. Spillane was named to the all-MAC second team after a strong junior season in which he finished with 105 tackles and three interceptions. Linebacker Asantay Brown and safety Justin Tranquill return as well, making the defense this team’s strength. 
It is undoubtedly difficult to replicate a nearly undefeated season, so the Broncos will have to take somewhat of a step back. Doing so with a new coaching staff and a game on the road against a top-five team makes the sledding even tougher. The Broncos may struggle in a tough opener Saturday at the Coliseum. However, the Broncos can make it through the first two games of the season — on the road against USC and Michigan State, respectively — they should be in the running for another MAC Championship.

Brian Chin | Daily Trojan
When USC scheduled this year’s season opener against Western Michigan in 2014, the Broncos were a middling team in the Mid-Atlantic Conference, an easy warm-up to Pac-12 play. Three years later, Western Michigan enters the Coliseum coming off of a MAC Championship, an undefeated 13-0 regular season and a berth in the Cotton Bowl. 
Granted, this edition of the Western Michigan Broncos is not the same as last year’s. Gone are several star players, most significantly the NCAA’s all-time leader in receiving yards — and top 10 NFL draft pick — Corey Davis. Also gone is 36-year-old head coach P.J. Fleck, who took his frenetic energy and exuberant “Row the Boat” slogan to the University of Minnesota (neither a Bronco nor a Gopher has anything to do with boats, but Fleck doesn’t seem to care). Replacing him is former Western Michigan quarterback and Syracuse offensive coordinator Tim Lester.
Despite losing several elements of its elite 2016 roster, Western Michigan is still no cupcake opener. The team returns eight members from a solid 2016 defensive unit, along with running back Jarvion Franklin on the offensive side. The 225-pound bruiser trucked his way to over 1,300 yards last year.
“This is as quality of a backfield [as you’ll find],” head coach Clay Helton said. “They have the three-headed monster that you hate to see: a really good running game, a really solid defense that held teams to 19 points a game and they’ve got the special teams player of the year in the MAC [Darius Phillips].” 
Another factor that will make Western Michigan a particularly challenging opponent is the heat. The Broncos run a fast-paced, high-volume spread option attack, and with temperature projections for Saturday in the mid ‘90s, hydration will be key for the Trojan defense.
“One of the things we do from a sports science standpoint, and we’ve done for the last year, is our hydration testing,” Helton said. “It’s a daily, consistent basis of testing of where guys are throughout the week that way so we are able to catch [hydration issues] before they cramp up.”
For the most part, USC enters its first game in healthy form. Senior right guard Viane Talamaivao (foot) and sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe (hip) both returned to practice this week, and Helton is optimistic that both will play on Saturday. However, the Trojans may be without sophomore wideout Michael Pittman Jr., who is doubtful with an ankle injury.
Getting the start at receiver alongside junior Jalen Greene and slot-man redshirt junior Deontay Burnett is redshirt senior Steven Mitchell Jr. He is coming off an injury of his own, as Western Michigan will be his first game since tearing an ACL in the seventh week of last season.
Another absence — however, not an injury-related one — is junior linebacker Cameron Smith, who is banned from playing in the first half. He is completing a one-game suspension as a result of a targeting penalty in the Rose Bowl. Despite being named one of the team’s captains, his suspension prevents him from being present at the coin toss, while sophomore Jordan Iosefa is set to make his first career start in his place.
When USC released the team’s official depth chart for Western Michigan last week, kicker and punter were two of the only positions left unsettled. On Thursday, Helton officially concluded both competitions with redshirt freshman Michael Brown handling kickoffs, true freshman Chase McGrath taking over placekicking duties and junior Reid Budrovich unseating incumbent junior Chris Tilbey at punter. In previous weeks, Helton appeared pessimistic about the team’s kicking prospects without the dismissed Matt Boermeester. However, his tone seemed to change after Thursday’s practice. 
“I feel a lot more confident than I did [in weeks past],” Helton said. “I think [Brown and McGrath] have grown. I think the competition has really, really helped.” 
With Sports Illustrated covers, ESPN features and high pre-season rankings, the Trojans’ summer has been filled with lots of buzz and high expectations. On Saturday, they finally get to just go out and play football. 
“I told the guys [at the end of Thursday’s practice] I have nothing left to say,” Helton said. “It’s time to play. We’ve gone five weeks now and I’m really excited just to see where we are.”

The USC Conscientious Living Organization: Veganism, Environmentalism, Reducetarianism club, a campus organization which encourages students and staff to consider sustainable eating habits, began its annual Reducetarian Project on Thursday, marking the beginning of a 30-day pledge to reduce animal product intake.
“Through that 30-day process, you can choose whatever method works best for you, whether that’s meatless Mondays, vegan on the weekends, dairy-free,” said Jennifer Cui, president and founder of CLOVER. “[You can do] whatever you feel like is sustainable for 30 days.”
The club, which focuses on veganism and the environment, comprises both members from last year as well as members of the USC Animal Rights Association and the Vegetarian-Vegan Club. The three organizations decided to merge together this semester due to shared member interests and previously co-hosted events. 
Cui first put the Reducetarian Project into action last year after speaking with Brian Kateman, one of the founders of the Reducetarian Project, to destigmatize veganism. She had to consider a lot of things when altering the project for USC’s campus.
“I kind of just went in a little bit blind and tried to figure out, structure-wise, how am I going to make sure people actually stick on this diet, where am I going to do this, how is this going to work, so I kind of just worked through all that and then had [the foundation] as support,” she said.
The Reducetarian Project formed around the idea that sustainable eating does not have to be all or nothing.
“You don’t have to be vegan or vegetarian,” Cui said. “You just have to be open-minded and want to learn more about why people are using plant-based [diets], what are the benefits [and] how to do it. We’re there as a support system to help you through whatever way you decide to be a reducetarian.”
The Reducetarian Project kicked off with a screening of Okja, a Netflix film focusing on the meat industry, and ended with the screening of What the Health, a documentary exploring the health benefits of a plant-based diet and the aspects of meat, eggs and dairy that can be potentially damaging to health and the environment.
“What we hope to do is to get students and faculty members involved in plant-based eating,” Cui said. “We already have a new plant-based section in the new dining hall in the Village, which is awesome; we’re just moving toward having plant-based options at all events, educating people on what a plant-based diet is and mitigating the negative stigmas that vegetarianism and veganism [have] on campus.”
Those who opt to participate in the 30-day pledge are encouraged to send in photos of their food and comments about their progress, which make them eligible to receive tickets for weekly raffles. Students can also receive raffle tickets for attending CLOVER’s weekly meetings during the span of the project. CLOVER is expecting increased participation in the pledge this year, in large part because of the recent involvement fair, Cui said.
“We doubled our number on our mailing list this year, so we’re at … 313 people,” she said. “We’re trying to max out as much as we can too.”
Club members are also looking forward to developing improved sustainability habits through the Reducetarian Project.
“I’m going to continue to develop in all the goals that I’ve set out for myself,” said Irena Preda, a member and graduate student studying vocal arts and opera. “I think it’s a great opportunity to really test how much I can adhere to the goals that I set out if I really focus on it. [It’s a great opportunity to] be able to talk to people who feel the same way about the issues that are important to me.”

Professor Robert Hernandez’s classroom is a unique, innovative space where digital journalism comes to life, immersing students and audiences alike with technologies like 360-degree video and augmented reality.
“Hands on Disruption: Experimenting with Emerging Technologies” is a course at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism taught by Hernandez that creates an innovative and collaborative space for students to engage with one of the newest journalism technologies: virtual reality. To abbreviate, the group of students enrolled in the class call themselves the JOVRNALISM Team. 
“For this class, I needed students to know and be comfortable with trying to figure out what the unknown is, where the professor doesn’t have all the answers and no one does because it’s brand new,” Hernandez said. “What you need is that curiosity and that commitment, that work ethic, to work with a team of folks who are as dedicated and passionate as you are, to figuring this stuff out.”
The Salton Sea Project, the JOVRNALISM team’s third and largest production to date, was nominated this summer as one of the finalists for the 2017 Online Journalism Awards under the Pro-Am Student Award category.  In 2016, Hernandez’s class created an interactive project on Houston’s vulnerability to coastal storms, foreshadowing the destruction of  an event like Tropical Storm Harvey.  
Every year, students are assigned a collaborative project with a media partner. Their nominated Salton Sea Project was produced and finalized in May 2017 in partnership with The Desert Sun. Students were divided into multiple video teams to create a seven-part series that virtually displayed the history, environmental disasters, visuals and possible future of California’s Salton Sea. 
“The goal visually was ‘How do you capture this beautiful, breathtaking place and capture the story in 360 video?’” Hernandez said. “We also incorporated drones because it’s just breathtaking to view it from above. We put a camera underwater to do a background for an infographic to explain the environmental issues that are happening in the water.”
Hernandez explained that the Salton Sea Project’s goal was to fully immerse the audience into the setting, allowing viewers to understand the stories of those affected by the dying sea.

Prior to working at USC and creating this course, Hernandez’s professional career revolved around discovering how digital technology and other forms of media can advance today’s media coverage. He was interested in experimenting with 360-degree videos, mobile devices and coding.
In 2013, Hernandez started off by introducing augmented reality and Google Glass courses to Annenberg and eventually created the VR class in 2015. He originally formed the JOVRNALISM team to prepare students for the professional world by providing opportunities to work with developers, designers and storytellers.
As an elective, Hernandez welcomes any student — regardless of their major — who wants to practice and have a hands-on experience with different journalism platforms. For the 15-week instructional period, Hernandez created a basic framework focused around stories, technology and partner-based media projects. 
“We’ve covered the Women’s March on Washington, done work for The New York Times, the Trump inauguration,” Hernandez said. “We’ve done work with ProPublica and The Texas Tribune — two amazing, award-winning investigative journalism organizations.” 
The students work with a basic guideline, pitching and creating ideas on how to use technology for storytelling. Throughout the semester, a variety of technological skills and methods such as video production, computer graphics and game development are taught. 
“Robert really teaches the class like a startup where he really lets the students run the class with our ideas,” Cameron Quon, former JOVRNALISM student and USC graduate, said. “Every class, we start off with a blank slate, and he asks us what we want to talk about and we throw out ideas. He tries to adjust the class to our interests so that’s pretty different compared to other campus courses.”
Because the class is not restricted to students within the journalism major, the JOVRNALISM team has a range of people from different grade levels and colleges. 
“It’s diverse in every sense of the word,” Hernandez said. “While Viterbi may skew more male or Annenberg may skew more female, my classes are about 50-50. I would lean back and see how a student from Viterbi was joking with an Annenberg student, giving each other nicknames … just respecting each other’s craft and trying to develop how this [VR] could work for journalism.”
Kaitlyn Mullin, a former JOVRNALISM student and USC graduate, emphasized the importance of the class, as there is always new technology being integrated into newsrooms. 
“Visual journalism is expanding rapidly to include AR and VR as part of the everyday reporting process,” Mullin said. “Students should take advantage of the resources and knowledge Robert has at his disposal to experiment in these fields … and start pushing the boundaries of what developing technology could mean for the future of journalism.”
In addition to his goal of informing the USC community of the advantages of VR in today’s journalism, Hernandez hopes that his course will teach his former and future students how to work with others of diverse backgrounds and talents in their respective career fields.

Disasters and tragedies have been formative chapters in nearly every modern American presidency. Former President Ronald Reagan urged a national reverence for those lost in the Challenger disaster. Former President Lyndon B. Johnson rallied a grief-stricken people with the famous phrase, “Let us continue.” Former President Bill Clinton knew the road to healing would be long after the Oklahoma City bombing — still, he said, “We must begin.” Even former President George W. Bush promised the American people that the terrorist organizations responsible for 9/11 would “hear all of us soon.” And former President Obama sang with parishioners after the Charleston attack. President Donald Trump greeted us with more wise words: “Great crowd, great turnout,” “A great book by a great guy, highly recommend” and, finally, “Nobody’s ever seen this much water.” 
Now, it would of course be premature to criticize Trump’s response to the hurricane effort as a whole, considering the relief effort has in large part just begun. But as first responders, NGOs and individual volunteers make their way to Houston to rescue victims and abate further damage, the president must remember that his response to this disaster will largely characterize the retroactive view of his presidential performance as a whole. Ostensibly, if you believe in Trump’s business acumen (a notion I think his track record speaks soundly against) then this sort of situation is exactly what you would expect him to master: multiple moving parts, fast-paced coordination, delegating responsibility, pleasing survivors as customers of the government they pay into and rely on.
 But other than a lackluster and remarkably unempathetic visit bookended by a meeting with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Trump appears to be mastering nothing but another one of Twitter’s armchair volunteers, a removed cheerleader — congratulating first responders, thanking the involved, and not getting any more or less involved than political decorum requires. Trump has a real chance to prove himself at the one thing he outwardly and constantly claims to do well — managing. That chance is quickly dissipating. Those who support the president, and who lent him the mandate to govern, should remind him of that mandate. Trump feeds off of his supporters — so tell him to start allocating funding, managing relief, sticking around during briefings and paying attention as one of the country’s largest cities sinks under 50 inches of water.
Even Abbott stated, politely but pointedly, that he expects the president to be “very concerned about what he sees, about the damage Texas has suffered.” Even from a supporting member of his party, the message to Trump is clear: Do more. 
The presidency has always maintained the ethos of a parental role over the nation at large; the aforementioned former presidents each served as a moral leader, a rock in times of crisis, a figure to look to for unity and national strength. Whether Trump has ever embodied any of these virtues is up to individual interpretation; mine, of course, is a resounding no. However, just as Trump so acutely perceived (and gleefully tweeted about) during Obama’s response to Hurricane Sandy, national disasters and tragedies often result in boons for presidential approval ratings — and this disaster gives Trump a real chance to change the course of the narrative from his recent string of faux pas and failures (and a shoddily handled, ill-advised pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio) to demonstrate what he advertised to supporters on the campaign: a straightforward, management-minded leader capable of doing things right and doing them quickly. But as we have observed, empathy is not one of the president’s strong suits, nor is detailed coordination (Re: the half-staffed State Department.) Nonetheless, Houston stands to benefit greatly if the president uses his federal power efficiently, listens to his advisors, attends briefing meetings and possibly — even barely — demonstrates real concern for the city of Houston. And perhaps he will. Time to show out, Mr. President. The nation is watching.
