The Little League World Series is one of the biggest non-professional sporting events of the year. Thousands travel from all over the world to Williamsport, Pa., while over one million viewers tune in to watch over 200 kids compete for a title, seemingly without a worry in the world. 
None of it would be possible without the support from the athletes’ parents.
Even though sports like football and basketball don’t have similar national events for young athletes, many local communities devote plenty of time to attending high school games, so parents do everything they can to make their childrens’ dreams a reality. 
Sometimes, though, they do too much. In many cases, parents make practice and training a higher priority than focusing on academics. 
This is partially due to the hope that elite athletic ability will lead to scholarships. However, just over 7% of high school athletes go on to play at a college, and only 2% get to play at a Division I school.
In most cases, the end goal is unattainable. Most teenagers that aspire to become a professional athlete fall short. Pursuing lifelong dreams and scholarships is great, but when do teenagers and parents realize they must start pursuing other goals? Are parents devoting too much time and money to athletic endeavors when they should be paying more attention to other aspects of their child’s life?
Let’s go back to the LLWS. There’s quite a long process required just to get to the tournament. There are over 200,000 little league baseball teams in the world. Most of these teams get eliminated before summer even begins, but for the teams that keep winning, there is plenty of additional travelling and costs that go into supporting a player.
From driving to practice to traveling across the country for tournaments and everything in between, parents devote a significant chunk of time and money to their child’s athletics. Many parents are even directly connected as coaches or unofficial team moms or dads. 
According to a MassMutual blog, “the typical parent spends between $100-500 per month, per child on elite sports … but $1000 per month is not unheard of.” This means that parents can spend an absurd amount of over $10,000 a year on their child’s athletic success.
The problem is that some parents want their children to do better and practice harder than the children do themselves. In extreme cases, parents go beyond training their children for the right reasons (such as getting exercise and staying healthy) and might start to become aggressive and abusive toward their own children — often for the purpose of chasing money, in whatever form that might be. 
This can cause the child to want to stop trying and quit sports altogether. When parents constantly push their children to train harder or become better, sports can have an unintended consequence of inducing depression rather than boosting confidence or self-esteem. 
So what’s the point? Maybe parents hope for their child to one day become a professional athlete and reward them with money. Or maybe they hope their child can one day become famous, making the parents feel accomplished themselves.
Spending money to support childrens’ athletic goals is often a great thing to do — but only within reason. Doing so becomes a problem when it starts to affect the child’s health. Of course, there are many factors that play into why parents spend so much money on youth athletics. Cultural norms and reputation can make a large impact on parents when dealing with their own children, even if these influences are only subconscious.
Sports are fun and extremely valuable tools for personal growth, fulfillment and child development, but life does not have to be all about sports. Parents should look beyond production and statistics to support their child’s athletic pursuits to what children can apply to their lives off the field. Wins and losses go, but the impact that sports can have on a child’s life last — and parents need to understand that.

Pancakes are an inevitable facet of any functioning society. Before noodles were crafted out of flour and starch, before bread was baked fresh in ovens, before rice was tenderly dried and boiled, there was the pancake. The mummified stomach of 5,300- year-old Otzi the Iceman was filled with pancakes. Unlike other carbohydrates that needed to be baked and processed, the pancake was simple — pan-fried, versatile, incredibly easy to make. 
Pancakes were the first food I ever learned to make. Too small to see the pancakes bubble and crisp at my own height, I stood on a kitchen chair, staring down at the stove. I dressed them in gooey, grocery store syrup and margarine, sometimes with fruit, sometimes with chocolate. 
Like many Americans, my first and only conception of pancakes was of the sweet kind. It wasn’t until I started living in Los Angeles that I realized my understanding of pancakes was incredibly limited. In fact, pancakes can be found across dozens of cuisines in varying forms and flavors. All of them I love. All of them I rely on for the most basic sense of comfort, the simplest kind of happiness.
Here are some of my favorites:
Traditional American Pancakes
Sometimes, I just want to press them to my face and inhale that sweet, warm flour smell, steam and butter deep in my pores, buried under a blanket and safe from the world. I was raised on these, and sometimes a plate of well-made pancakes was the closest thing to home all week. 
Most pancakes in America, from diners to breakfast cafes to fancy brunches, are bound by their sweetness. Served with syrup and butter, sometimes with a scattering of fruit or chocolate, pancakes have fallen into a comfortable monotony. The recipe to American pancakes hardly changes, but when it does, it’s noticeable. My favorite American pancakes in Los Angeles are from The Original Pantry Cafe, which spikes each batch with a healthy dose of sugar and butter within the batter. They weigh about three pounds and taste exactly like pound cake. In American pancakes, the only deciding factor in a “good” or “bad” pancake is the recipe used and the preparation. Griddle or pan? It makes a difference.
Korean Jeon
Every week, I pass by the H Mart in Koreatown, and every week, I fall prey to the temptation of pancakes. Eggy and tender, Korean jeon (or buchimgae, or pajeon) spans a variety of styles: kimchi, green onion, crab and pollock are just a few popular in America. Jeon serves not as a breakfast entree but as a side dish as a part of banchan, an elaborate spread of side dishes to accompany a main meal. Jeon, a ubiquitous side, can be found all over Koreatown, especially in Korean BBQ restaurants. In H Mart, they sell several varieties of jeon, made earlier in the day and sealed for casual purchase. Fresher and tastier pancakes can be found at restaurants like Kobawoo House, which serves a fantastic haemul pajeon, a pancake filled with seafood and scallions. Mostly, however, I find myself eating jeon on the street outside of H Mart, still in its packaging. I do not care. It’s delicious anyways.  
Chinese Bing
My first experience biting into crispy layers of delicate, onion-infused pastry was almost a religious one. Scallion pancakes are a popular side dish and an essential component of Chinese and Taiwanese cuisine, found lurking under dumplings and rice dishes. Pan-fried and full of flavor, scallion pancakes are an incredible feat and one that I will never fail to order if I find it on the menu. 
Unlike American pancakes, cong you bing is delicately fried from a dough instead of a batter, speckled with chunks of green onion. As a result, the scallion pancake is irresistibly crisp and crunchy. 
Similar to the Korean jeon, bing encompasses several dishes and preparations of flatbread — jianbing is a large, crepe-like pancake and popular street food, to name another variety. But in my eyes, there is no better bing than the scallion pancake, usually served in neat triangles, sometimes wrapped around pieces of steak in the quintessential Los Angeles beef roll. San Gabriel Valley is flooded with excellent scallion pancakes — Flavor Garden and J & J Restaurant serve two delicious preparations of it. In Silverlake, Pine & Crane serves crispy pancakes and beef rolls under romantic candlelight. There is nothing quite as satisfying as a fresh scallion pancake. It will leave behind onion-scented oil and plenty of crumbs, but it will be worth it. 
Ethiopian Injera
A typical display of Ethiopian food embodies a grandeur that is only matched by the table-long dishes of banchan served in Korean restaurants. Typically served on top of a thin, massive sourdough pancake called injera, multiple types of stews and dishes are placed onto one plate alongside extra sheet-like rolls of the pancake. 
Popular injera toppings include kitfo, minced raw beef mixed with fragrant clarified butter and spoonfuls of spice; tibs, a sauteéd meat and vegetable mixture and wat, an onion stew with dozens of variations. But in my eyes, the star of the show is always injera. Tangy from the sourdough, soft but just sturdy enough to pick up the thinnest of stews, injera is more than a side dish. It is the utensil, the plate, a prominent flavor, an essential element of Ethiopian cuisine. 
Instead of forks and knives, the injera itself is used to pick up its toppings. Its spongy texture soaks up residual sauces, tasting better and better as the meal comes to a close. Try the fantastic Meals by Genet in Little Ethiopia — the injera will change you for the better.

Every Wednesday, the Trojan Farmers Market supports local vendors from the L.A. area. Swarms of hungry students have dozens of options to choose from as vendors set up tents selling everything from chicken and waffles to Hawaiian juices to fresh produce. On Sept. 11, a new vendor made its second-week debut — Jay’s Hot Dogs was ready to bring the spice to campus. 
Palmdale resident Johnny Richard decided to channel his passion for cooking into a business around a year and a half ago. He began cooking for himself at age 13, learning the art of spices from his parents. However, he said his friends were not aware of his culinary talents until he started making meals for them two years ago.
A little while after Richard began cooking for his friends, he started Jay’s Hot Dogs, founded on what he said is his creative take on a classic recipe. 
“I’m not a big fan of bland food,” Richard said. “I like to dibble and dabble with different seasonings — play with this, see how it tastes.” 
Since Richard started his business, he found success at different events and markets around the Antelope Valley. Now, through his connections at other farmers markets, Richard has found himself in an upgraded spot at USC in the past two weekly markets. 
“I think it fits in [the USC market] because a lot of people like the raw material stuff, but they also want to try different foods,” Richard said. “I’m sure all the stores and restaurants around campus, everyone’s probably been through them over and over and over.”  
As a local chef in search of support, Richard believes his tent brings something distinctive to the market: a tasty and satisfying alternative to typical college food. 
“I specialize in Philly cheesesteak fries,” Richard said. “Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, fried fish, chicken wings, deep fried cornish hens, the whole chicken, also homemade macaroni and cheese … and BBQ.” 
As next week approaches, Richard prepares for his second venture at the farmers market, nervous but confident in how well his food was received last week.
“I want to see how it goes,” Richard said. “Because [it was] my first week, I was surprised about the customers I was getting. It really picked up, real quickly. I think we did pretty well, even though it was our first time, because there were lines of people.”
By the end of the day, J’s Hot Dogs was ready to throw in the towel. Richard explained that it had sold out of mac and cheese, fries and fish. In anticipation for next week, J’s Hot Dogs looks forward to keep bringing out more culinary treats.

USC and UCLA’s storied crosstown rivalry will be renewed Wednesday when the No. 25 Trojans women’s volleyball team travels to Pauley Pavilion. 
The Trojans enter the matchup after an up-and-down weekend in San Diego. USC lost in a hard-fought five-set match to USD then bounced back with a dominant sweep of Long Beach State. 
The Trojans have seen their ranking steadily drop from No. 14 all the way to No. 25 after a shaky 6-4 start. Battered with injuries, the talented roster has yet to reach its full potential. 
The tilt between USC and UCLA will begin conference play for both teams. UCLA enters the match with a record of 5-4 but is coming off two straight 3-0 defeats. 
The Trojans’ current starting rotation still lacks experience and faces various injuries — but head coach Brent Crouch sees a silver lining.
“So while we haven’t started clicking yet with the starting group, overall I think because people are getting out there and playing a lot … the team-building part is way more advanced than it was last year,” Crouch said. 
Though as the team is fighting through injuries, it is coming closer to full health. Senior opposite hitter Emily Baptista is expected to make her full return this week. Baptista, still recovering from a knee injury, has only played in 10 sets so far this season — all in the Trojan Invitational two weekends ago.
Crouch hopes to have a more consistent rotation once everyone is healthy. Just two players for the Trojans have played in all 39 sets this year: last year’s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year setter Raquel Lázaro and senior middle blocker Jasmine Gross.
This past weekend, Crouch began that process by subbing just four times all match. 
 “We were really clicking against Long Beach [State], and I didn’t want to disrupt that flow,” Crouch said. 
The Trojans can now count on consistent contributions from All-American senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who recovered from a concussion suffered earlier in the season. Despite missing two weeks of play, Lanier is third on the team in kills with 92 and has posted a .316 kill rate this season.
The team’s leader in kills, freshman outside hitter Kalen Owes, sat out in the matchup with Long Beach State. 
 Facing UCLA on the road is always a difficult matchup for any USC team, but the atmosphere at UCLA’s home opener will prove even tougher than usual. 
“There’s the challenge of the venue, of the energy that will be for UCLA in that match,” Crouch said. “The emotions that are connected with playing your rival and learning how to play our game despite those distractions will be important, and I think we are getting good at that.” 
To prepare for UCLA’s attack, the Trojans are practicing defending against a mix of roll-shots and hard swings. USC struggled to defend this mix of shots against Yale, and UCLA excels at mixing up its hits. 
UCLA mostly runs an offense that includes two setters, meaning there are always three hitters available — making the offense difficult to defend.
Though the Bruins run a tricky offense, they have only two hitters with over 50 kills this season compared to five for USC. The Bruins’ leading hitter is junior outside hitter Mac May, an All-American honorable mention last year. 
USC went 2-0 against the Bruins in 2018, sweeping them in the first matchup and winning a five-set battle in the second. 
“They are going to be fired up to play us,” Crouch said. “We won the last few, but they are always going to be motivated to give us their best.”

Late on Tuesday afternoon, a roar could be heard from the west side of University Park. It wasn’t from the brass of the Trojan Marching Band or from a swim meet at Uytengsu Aquatics Center or a baseball game at Dedeaux Field. 
Instead, the deafening cheer came from speakers at Howard Jones Field mimicking crowd noise at USC’s afternoon football practice. 
The Trojans are simulating stadium noise to prepare for what’s expected to be a raucous and hostile environment when they face No. 17 Washington at Husky Stadium this weekend. 
Washington is coming off a 45-19 victory over BYU, a team that upset head coach Clay Helton’s Trojans in overtime Week 3. The Trojans are coming off an impressive win of their own, having just defeated Utah at the Coliseum. 
Utah was the No. 10 team in the nation and a favorite to win the Pac-12 before No. 21 USC’s Friday night victory. Prior to the game, it had been two years since USC last won a game as an underdog. In 2016, USC upset the No. 4 ranked Huskies 26-13 in Seattle, and they’ll be looking to upset Washington again this weekend. 
More of the Same
After only two passes against Utah, freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis was tackled to the ground and knocked out of the game with a concussion. Redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink stepped in for Slovis and had a breakout performance, orchestrating USC’s upset victory to the tune of 351 passing yards and 3 touchdowns through the air.
Fink’s breakout performance revived what many feared was a lost season for USC after losing to BYU the previous week.
Still, despite the attention and new concerns over USC’s health at quarterback, Fink isn’t changing anything about his play. 
“My game hasn’t changed whatsoever …  you know, my game is my game, and I’m going to play to the best of my ability,” Fink said after practice. “Obviously, I’m going try to protect myself because I know the situation, but like I said, I’m going to keep playing the way I play.”
USC is once again the underdog this week against Washington. Despite the Huskies being favored to win by more than a touchdown, redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie said the team isn’t going to change what it does.
“We don’t care if we’re the underdog and we don’t care if we’re supposed to beat them. We’re going to get every team’s best because of who we are,” McKenzie said after practice. “We have to bring that same intensity every week.”
Quarterback Depth
Slovis’s injury means USC now has only one healthy scholarship quarterback available in Fink. Behind Fink on the depth chart is redshirt junior quarterback Brandon Perdue. Perdue joined USC in Fall 2018 after transferring from junior college, where he finished with a career completion percentage of 53.3 and two touchdowns. 
Despite Perdue’s inexperience and less than stellar junior college career, the quarterback still has the confidence of his head coach.
“He was the quarterback on our service team last year as well as this year, and I watch all the tape,” Helton told reporters after practice. “He’s done a tremendous job and he’s a competitor. “He’s a good athlete that not only was a quarterback but also helped us out at safety. Now, he’s being asked to be a backup quarterback for this game. He’s over here mentally getting reps and physically getting reps, and he said, ‘Coach, if I’m called upon, I’ll do my best for my brothers.’”
Helton and offensive coordinator Graham Harrell also confirmed that redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns received reps at quarterback during practice.
Injuries
Sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga is currently in concussion protocol and recovering from an AC sprain. Sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin ran around at practice and looked good, according to Helton. Griffin left last Friday’s game with back spasms and a slightly bulging disk. The cornerback’s status will be evaluated day to day. Slovis, meanwhile, is still not medically cleared for Saturday.

The USC women’s tennis team competed in the Milwaukee Tennis Classic this weekend to open their 2019 season, in addition to the Battle in the Bay tournament in San Francisco. The Trojans left Milwaukee with a singles title win from senior captain Angela Kulikov.
Kulikov was seeded No. 13 in the singles draw for tournament, and her path to the championship was not easy. She defeated both the No. 3 and No. 7 seeds on the road to the final against No. 5-seeded sophomore Daevenia Achong of the University of Miami. 
Kulikov narrowly defeated Achong 7-6, (5) in a close first set tiebreak. She went on to take the second set 6-4, securing the MTC title. Head coach Alison Swain believed Kulikov was well prepared heading into her matches and that she maintained an elite degree of focus. 
“Angela came into the tournament prepared to compete and executed her game plan throughout the event,” Swain told USC Athletics. “It was tough to transition from indoors to outdoors throughout the weekend, but Angela handled it well and competed at an exceptionally high level.”
Kulikov’s title earned her a wild card spot in the Oracle ITA National Fall Championships in Newport Beach this November. 
Kulikov’s teammates also enjoyed a successful weekend in Milwaukee. Sophomore Danielle Wilson reached the semifinals of the MTC, defeating three top 16 seeds before her 6-2, 6-2 loss to Achong. 
Wilson and Kulikov teamed up in the doubles bracket and reached the semifinals along with the duo of senior Constance Branstine and junior Ana Neffa, but both pairs fell short of the championship match. 
Milwaukee wasn’t the only destination for the women’s team this week, as several Trojans participated in the Battle of the Bay Classic in San Francisco. Senior Sydney Van Alphen defeated top-seeded sophomore Solymar Colling of the University of San Diego in three sets 1-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
Sophomore Estella Jaeger also competed in a three-set match in the first round, taking down freshman Elise Frigout of the University of Pacific 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
Both Van Alphen and Jaeger advanced to the tournament’s quarterfinal, while freshman Payton Saca gained her first collegiate experience by winning an extra match 6-2, 6-3 against freshman Alicia Yue from the University of San Francisco.
Jaeger and Van Alphen were also paired in the doubles bracket and lost 8-2 to Arizona graduate student Abby Amos and junior Talya Zandberg. 
“We had great results from everyone representing USC at the tournament, and it’s exciting to begin the year by taking home a title in our first event,” Swain said. 
The Trojans look to continue their success after a 20-8 2018 season that ended in a Round of 16 loss to South Carolina. After graduating only one senior, the program will continue to build and strengthen its roster with a blend of youth and experience. 
With the No. 7-ranked recruiting class in the nation according to the Tennis Recruiting Network, the new class comprised of players including Carson Branstine, Eryn Cateyano and four-star Payton Saca figures to be a strength for the Trojans in 2019 and beyond. 
The program also features the promotion of Rachel Manasse to assistant coach, who served as a volunteer coach on the staff this past season. 
“I’m very excited to be back this season as an assistant coach,” Manasse told USC Athletics. “It’s such an amazing opportunity. This team has so much potential, and I can’t wait to be a part of their continued success.” 
The Trojans are slated to play Thursday at the ITA Oracle Masters in Malibu, Calif.

Whenever senior Daphne Armstrong visited Greek Row after a weekend full of parties, she always thought about the thousands of plastic red Solo cups littered on the ground that would end up in landfills.
After realizing how wasteful and harmful party cups were for the environment, Armstrong, who is majoring in psychology and public policy, decided to take matters into her own hands by creating startup SUPCUP, which aims to reduce the amount of waste caused by college parties.
Launched in September, the company sells reusable red party cups made of stainless steel as an alternative to the traditional plastic ones typically used for many social events. SUPCUPs look identical to their counterpart and are sold individually and in packs of four, 10 and 20. Since its launch, over 400 cups have been sold, Armstrong said.
“Traditional red party cups are made from plastic No. 6, polystyrene, which cannot be recycled,” Armstrong said. “So all of these cups, even if you use them for 15 minutes, are on Earth like in landfills or the ocean where it takes 450 years to decompose into microplastics.” 
Despite lacking background knowledge in entrepreneurship or business, Armstrong was inspired to create SUPCUP due to her love for nature. When she moved from Missouri to California for college, Armstrong began to immerse herself in the environment by becoming an avid surfer and a trip leader for Peaks & Professors, a student group that organizes outdoor adventures. 
She then decided to take courses on climate change, where she first learned of the environmental impacts of plastic and that party cups were not recyclable. 
“[That fact] was a huge shock to me because I had always assumed they were, even as someone who’s hyper-aware of their plastic usage,” Armstrong said. “So we’ll go through four or five cups a night, just not really thinking about it. Learning that fact, coupled with seeing all the waste [at Greek Row] everyday, just made me have to do something about it.” 
Armstrong also attributed the development of her startup to Blackstone LaunchPad at USC, a campus resource that provides mentorship, ideation and venture creation to aspiring student entrepreneurs. 
James Bottom, project director of Blackstone LaunchPad USC, said SUPCUP was a unique company. 
“I’ve been meeting Daphne for a while,” Bottom said. “It started off as an interesting idea that she had, mostly because she wanted to figure out a way to improve the sustainability of some of the things that she’s seen.”
He also added how transitioning to the use of sustainable cups is important for college culture. 
“There’s a lot of pregame activities that take place all over the United States, and I think that a lot of college campuses, certainly if they have a big football crowd, will have a whole lot of people that are using red styrofoam cups or red Solo cups for their pregame activities,” Bottom said. “It’s just a lot of ways that is potentially easy to mitigate. 
William Koch, a customer and senior majoring in international relations, said he admires the company’s goal to push sustainability on campuses. 
“The college lifestyle is inherently fairly wasteful,” Koch said. “[The problem] is very easy to ignore and go for something that’s easier and quicker, especially red Solo cups, which are a defined part of college culture.”
Koch purchased SUPCUPs for Delta Phi Epsilon, USC’s professional foreign service and international relations fraternity, because he wanted the organization to be mindful during tailgates while still enjoying the social experience. 
“I like SUPCUPs because they look like a regular red Solo cup,” Koch said. “You know you’re not losing anything out there … you can still be sustainable while doing the same things that you would with a regular solo cup.” 
In the future, Armstrong hopes to expand her company to other college campuses and added that she would like to create reusable cups in different colors depending on a college’s colors. 
“Even if people don’t buy the cups, my goal is to start conversations and create conscientiousness around single-use plastic consumption and to advocate wrecks on our planet,” Armstrong said. “I believe that even the tiniest behavioral changes cannot help but seep awareness into other habits in our daily life, and every cup can make a difference.”

Senators unanimously passed a resolution to publish course evaluations on a student-accessible platform at an Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday. 
The resolution, co-authored by former Senators Jacquelyne Tan and Matthew Crane and former Senate Aide Divya Gupta, calls for a more comprehensive review of classes and professors to be available to students.
USG President Trenton Stone emphasized the importance of a well-informed, student-accessible platform for course evaluation.
“As of now, students are making their class decisions and who to take a class from based on things like RateMyProfessor and old PowerPoints or syllabi that they find,” Stone said. “It’s a pretty basic thing to be able to allow students to make the most informed decision about what classes they are signing up for and making course evaluations more accessible to students.” 
Stone expressed concern about students’ current reliance on peer feedback site RateMyProfessor and supported the resolution’s focus on a more reliable platform.
“I think RateMyProfessor is kind of almost like using Wikipedia for a research project … People use RateMyProfessors because there is just not a better solution to get accurate, detailed information about classes and professors,” he said. 
During the meeting, senators passed amendments to the resolution, adding incoming Provost Charles Zukoski, Information Technology Services Senior Project Manager Nishu Emde and Director of the Office of Institutional Research Ray Gonzalez to the list of administrators who will receive the resolution. 
Stone said he hopes USG can work to improve professor evaluations.
“We are working on what is called the student services initiative and they’re doing a whole overhaul of web registration, of the financial aid portal and many other platforms,” Stone said. “When you’re registering for a course, you can look at the syllabus, you can look at the professor’s evaluation, you can look at so much more information than just the 25-word sentence that gives you the course description.”
Following the passage of the resolution, Sen. Hailey Robertson spoke about her work on a new initiative with the mobile therapy company Talkspace. She developed an anonymous survey with USG Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard to gather data about how students perceive the University’s mental health services and the potential willingness of students to use Talkspace services.
“If we can [hope to] get more student perspectives on what their needs are before just hopping in and saying this is the solution to mental health care,” Robertson said. “We figured that a survey would help us reach as many students as possible.” 
Robertson said she is currently speaking with representatives from Talkspace, who have partnered with other universities like Williams College to provide mental health care services to employees and students.
“Our goal for the initiative is to, ultimately partner with Talk Space to have a subscription paid for all students who wish to use Talk Space,” she said. “Currently, it’s a pretty expensive service … We hope to have it free for all students.”

A father and businessman who paid $250,000 for his son to be admitted to USC as a fake water polo recruit was sentenced to four months in prison Tuesday in Boston Federal Court, against protest from his attorneys. 
Devin Sloane, the founder and CEO of waterTALENT, started working with William “Rick” Singer, who ran the backdoor admissions scheme, in 2017 to guarantee his son’s admission to USC as a water polo recruit, according to an FBI investigation released in March. The investigation found over 20 students who were admitted to USC using bribes and fake athletic profiles, and Sloane is the first USC-connected parent to be sentenced. 
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani also ordered Sloane to complete 500 hours of community service and fined him $95,000. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, Sloane’s attorneys pushed for three years of supervised release, a $75,000 fine and 2,000 hours of community service instead of prison, advocating on grounds of good character. 
Sloane’s attorneys did not respond with comment on the sentencing in time for publication.
Sloane wrote a letter to the judge Sept. 14 asking for leniency, calling his actions “wrong and shameful” and acknowledging he “failed miserably by doing too much, going too far and crossing the line.”
“The realization of the horrible mistake I had made and the crime I committed became clear to me after 15 armed agents raided our home on March 12, arrested me and took me away from my wife and our young children in handcuffs,” Sloane wrote. 
Sloane is one of 15 parents who plead guilty in the college admissions scandal and the second to be sentenced. He is the second parent to receive a sentence, following actress Felicity Huffman last week who will face 14 days in prison and was fined $30,000 for paying $15,000 to change her daughter’s SAT scores. 
Sloane plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one of honest services mail fraud. 
Records show Sloane purchased water polo gear on Amazon that his son wore in a posed photo in the family’s swimming pool. Sloane later emailed a graphic designer to modify the image to make his son look like a water polo player for a false recruiting profile.
“We researched a few water polo athlete images and the majority are cropped against a background so they can use them in promotional materials,” the graphic designer wrote in an email to Sloane, according to court documents. “We were able to adjust the color and complete a clean extraction to mimic this look.”
In November 2017, former assistant athletics director Donna Heinel presented Sloane’s son to the USC subcommittee for athletic admissions and sent him a conditional acceptance letter, calling him someone who could “make a significant contribution to the intercollegiate athletic program.” 
Sloane paid Heinel $50,000 and sent an additional $200,000 to the Key Worldwide Foundation, the company owned by Singer that allegedly worked to conceal bribes as donations, after his son received an official acceptance late last March.
USC may have caught Sloane after a high school counselor questioned his son’s college water polo recruitment when he wasn’t part of the school team. 
“They know about USC,” Singer wrote in an email to Sloane. “One of the counselors questioned [your son] getting in as water polo player this week. My folks at [USC] called me, so we could restate [your son] playing in Italy as [his high school] does not have a team.”
In response to a request for comment, USC directed the Daily Trojan to an informational page on its website last updated Aug. 11. 
“The University is conducting a full review of the matter and continues to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation,” the page read. “We are in the process of identifying donations that may have been received in connection with the alleged scheme and determining how to redirect those funds … We will take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity of our admissions process and to ensure we conduct ourselves in a manner consistent with our values.”

Trousdale Parkway was lined with tables representing various student organizations and an ice cream truck for VoteSC’s National Voter Registration Day event Tuesday. VoteSC, a nonpartisan voting initiative, helped over 150 students pledge or register to vote in the 2020 elections, surpassing the numbers from 2017, the last non-election year.
Student organizations and volunteers, including the Environmental Student Assembly, Latinx Student Assembly and even the Los Angeles County Registrar’s Office, encouraged students to register.
During the three-hour event, volunteers asked those walking on Trousdale if they were registered to vote or if they were willing to pledge to vote in 2020. As an incentive, students were offered free ice cream. 
Sally Rakestraw, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said the event helped her figure out how to register for her first election.
“It’s just more convenient,” Rakestraw said. “It’s an easy way to get people to register, and there was also a great incentive with the ice cream truck.”
VoteSC was originally directed by the Political Student Assembly, the Center for the Political Future and the Unruh Institute of Politics. The initiative was launched as a means of making voting more accessible to students on campus and encouraging civic engagement. Since then, VoteSC has become an established student organization. 
One of the co-presidents, senior Eleonora Viotto, said that VoteSC’s first year faced a lack of recognition and response from school administration, making its efforts to develop partnerships with branches of the University difficult. However, President Carol Folt’s appearance at the event Tuesday made VoteSC hopeful about the new change in leadership. 
VoteSC founders Viotto, Alec Vandenberg and Brianna Miles presented a letter to Folt, outlining their goals for the club in an effort to have their purpose better integrated at the University.
“[Folt] seemed very open and receptive and was very excited about partnering with us,” Viotto said. “So we’re really looking forward to that partnership, and we’re hoping she’ll sign the memorandum.”
From their experience in registration drives leading up to last year’s midterm elections, the student organization plans to develop more partnerships on campus to increase connections and registration for 2020. 
“Reaching out to different organizations and making sure that we have those partnerships going is really helpful,” Viotto said. “People tend to gravitate toward people that they know on Trousdale, so rather it being five random strangers wearing VoteSC T-shirts yelling at people  ‘Register to vote!’ and it’s your friend or an organization you’re already a part of, you’re more likely to wander up just to say hi … and proceed through the process.”
Carissa Martinez, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said VoteSC’s event was not only helpful in not only reminding her to vote for next year’s elections, but also encouraging her to get others to register. 
“People don’t think that their vote matters,” Martinez said. “So if one person decides to vote, it will lead other people and their friends to vote.”
VoteSC’s goal is to make sure to be inclusive and offering that right to all those who can vote. Vandenberg, senior adviser of VoteSC, said the organization plans to provide the opportunity to everyone.
“Basically, register, engage and educate all students on this campus,” Vandenberg said. “Even taking our efforts off-campus and making sure that voter engagement is year-round and as inclusive as possible.”
The club has been successful in partly meeting this goal on campus. Grace Power, a junior majoring in theatre and economics, pledged to vote in 2020 and said events like these are important since voting is the main way to make a difference.
“Voting is not the most convenient thing, especially when you’re in college,” Power said. “We can talk about the issues all day, every day with each other, but that’s not going to actually make a difference. Maybe our voting systems aren’t perfect right now, but it’s the best shot we have.”

“We choose truth over facts,” former Vice President and 2020 Democratic nominee hopeful Joe Biden announced at the Iowa State Fair last month, much to the confusion of his supporters. This misquote is one of many gaffes that Biden has made on his current campaign trail. In addition to providing fodder for President Trump’s campaign, these moments have also led voters on both sides of the aisle to wonder if his age is impeding his ability to serve as a political leader. 
Considering the effect of aging on the brain in healthy adults, it appears that these ruminations have legitimate scientific backing that should influence the way voters evaluate presidential candidates.
At age 76, Biden is not the oldest of the presidential candidates — that distinction goes to Bernie Sanders, who is 78 years old. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another front-runner, is 70. And in the last three years of his first term, President Trump, 73, has said plenty of nonsensical things, like referring to Tim Cook as “Tim Apple” and mixing up his grandfather’s birthplace with his father’s, that have compelled some people to wonder if he is in the early stages of dementia.
Senior rights activists are swift to label this kind of criticism as ageism, and it certainly appears that way on a surface level. However, the scientific evidence supporting cognitive decline in elderly adults shows that in presidential elections, age is a legitimate concern, not just unfounded bias.
The typical course of aging results in a trade-off between the two types of intelligence proposed by psychologist Raymond Cattell in the 1940s: crystallized and fluid. Crystallized intelligence, more commonly thought of as wisdom, is the accumulation of experiences, education and factual knowledge over the years. In contrast, fluid intelligence refers to one’s ability to problem-solve in unfamiliar situations, think analytically and learn new things.
As people age, their crystallized intelligence improves, but fluid intelligence peaks around age 40 and begins to decline soon after. For presidents, both types of intelligence are important — crystallized intelligence is needed to make informed decisions, and fluid intelligence is necessary for coming up with quick solutions in times of crisis. Because it is not possible to peak in both types of intelligence simultaneously, it is important for presidents to surround themselves with Cabinet members who possess the type of intelligence they lack.
Another neurological consequence of aging is the disproportionate loss of prefrontal cortex matter, a phenomenon that begins at the age of 60. As stated in a study by professor of neurology Mark Fisher at UC Irvine, the prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain responsible for executive functions like organization and decision-making. 
Fisher’s study shows that while all areas of the brain show decreasing volume with age, the prefrontal cortex shows the greatest volume loss as a result of age. To clarify, this loss of executive function is the typical course for healthy individuals without severe age-related impairments like dementia. Considering that decision-making is perhaps the most important role of the president, this finding has significant implications for the older pool of political candidates.
An important factor to consider in the loss of the prefrontal cortex is the aspects of executive function that it affects. The same study by Fisher states that executive function also encompasses memory and communication, yet interestingly, these abilities are not impacted by the decline in prefrontal cortex matter. This means that even political leaders who come across as sharp in speeches and public appearances may struggle with rapid decision-making in the situation room. Thus, when electing leaders, it is important for voters to consider not just the appearance of candidates and their proposed policies, but also how well they will function in meetings behind closed doors.
Given all this evidence, it is worth noting that there are individual differences in aging, meaning not everyone experiences cognitive decline at the same rate. For example, there are protective factors that can delay or prevent its onset. 
According to a review published in the Journal of the Formosan Medical Association, staying physically, mentally and socially active are scientifically proven ways to reduce the risk of severe cognitive decline. The same review also linked less higher education to a higher risk of dementia after the age of 60. Considering that presidential candidates meet all the above criteria, they likely experience less severe cognitive decline than the average senior citizen.
Despite the overwhelming evidence that age-driven cognitive decline plays a role in how well someone can serve as president, it is not a topic that is seriously discussed by the White House or the public. 
While presidents do go through physical check-ups that look for cognition problems, they set too low of a standard for someone leading a country. These tests look for conditions like dementia and stroke-related problems, not symptoms of typical age-related cognitive decline that can impact a president’s problem-solving and decision-making capabilities. 
Furthermore, these medical examinations come after a president has already been elected, and there is no legal requirement for the all the results to be made public or even for presidents to take them. Without this information, it is up to the voters to gauge how candidates perform on the campaign trail and whether or not they are mentally prepared to take on the decision-making roles that come with the presidency. 
With the 2020 elections coming up, voters should factor in how age-related cognitive decline may impact their candidate’s ability to serve as president.

Chrissy Marshall is a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production at USC. She’s active on YouTube and TikTok, where she posts videos about accessibility, American Sign Language and her experiences as a deaf student. Marshall is just one of millions of deaf and hard of hearing people around the world who depend on sign language for communication, yet USC, which boasts inclusivity and global perspectives, fails to recognize it as a foreign language.
In 1988, California recognized ASL as a foreign language, allowing it to satisfy language requirements for a high school diploma. ASL isn’t just pantomime — its expressive, intricate movements and gestures are vital to understanding the language. It has its own grammar and syntax rules that separate it from traditional spoken English. 
Recognizing and offering ASL as a foreign language would be a practical choice for students. ASL is the third most studied foreign language among college students. That’s because ASL is the primary language of an estimated quarter to half a million Americans. This is extremely important considering the implications for deaf children, who will likely need this language to communicate and develop throughout their lifetimes. Offering ASL as a foreign language option will lead to better child care for deaf children.
USC’s main arguments against ASL as a foreign language are its lack of a written component and the fact that it is indigenous to America, thereby making it not foreign. However, multiple languages that the United States recognizes as “foreign,” such as Navajo, have both of these qualities. Navajo, the most-spoken Native American language in the United States, is purely verbal and is indigenous to America.
Other arguments against ASL call it a derivative of English. While ASL was created for the purpose of non-verbally conversing in English, ASL has been such a powerful resource for the deaf and hard of hearing that it has spawned many varieties around the world, from French Sign Language to Puerto Rican Sign Language. The fact that it originated from English doesn’t mean it isn’t an incredibly useful tool, can’t be translated and shouldn’t be taught. 
As it stands, USC does not accept ASL transfer credits, but one of USC’s biggest transfer schools, Santa Monica College, offers two ASL courses. We should not punish students for wanting to make the world an easier place for those who are hard of hearing, especially in a time of increasing inclusivity and awareness.
Not only is rejection of ASL as a language audist, but it also fails to understand the true purpose of learning a foreign language — to break communication barriers. It’s imperative to give the deaf community the respect it deserves by offering courses that will allow us to communicate more fluidly with it.

The USC women’s soccer team is perfect no more — but the Trojans remain unbeaten. 
No. 2 USC tied with unranked Baylor 2-2 in its final non-conference match Friday in Waco, Texas. 
The Trojans came into the game with the program’s all-time best start to a season at 7-0-0, and it was business as usual to open up the game. 
Baylor narrowly survived the first wave of USC attacks as the Trojans failed to convert on numerous opportunities to open the game. 
Head coach Keidane McAlpine made a few adjustments, and the first goal of the night came from the bench for the visitors. Sophomore defender Ashley Soto found freshman midfielder Jaelyn Eisenhart  for a header, and the Trojans took a 1-0 lead close to the end of the first half. 
Junior forward Penelope Hocking continued her incredible start to the season as she found the back of the net yet again, bringing her total to 7 goals this year. Freshman midfielder Olufolasade Adamolekun picked up her second assist of the year on the play. 
McAlpine praised his team’s first-half play as USC continued its streak of eight straight games with multiple goals. 
“I thought we started the game extremely well today,” McAlpine said in an interview on the team’s Twitter after the game. 
With both of Baylor’s leading goal scorers not in uniform, USC seemed primed going into halftime to extend its perfect run. But Baylor head coach Paul Jobson knew the Bears had their backs up against the wall. He told the Waco Tribune Herald about the necessity to find goals outside their two top scorers after the game. 
“When [senior forwards Camryn Wendlandt] and Raegan [Padgett], your two leading goal scorers, are out, you wonder where you’re going to generate some goal-scoring,” Jobson said.
But the Bears were able to overcome the absences in the second half. It only took 10 minutes for sophomore forward Elena Reyna to squeeze one past goalkeeper Anna Smith to shrink the USC lead to 1. 
Baylor continued to play ultra-aggressively in the second half, outshooting USC 11-6 and finding the back of the net one more time when sophomore midfielder Giuliana Cunningham equalized the game with 30 minutes to play. 
USC was lucky to get out of the second half and into overtime. As time expired, Cunningham’s strike hit the post, and the rebound fell to Reyna, whose shot flew over the crossbar. 
“I was extremely disappointed with the way we played that second half,” McAlpine said. “I didn’t think we rose to the level of [Baylor’s] intensity, and we let them get back into the game that we had under control. That’s something we’ve got to get better at.”
In the first overtime, Baylor controlled the tempo, and Reyna had an opportunity that ricocheted off the right post as the Trojans barely avoided their first loss of the season.
USC picked up play toward the end of overtime and outshot the Bears 6-3 in extra time. It took two big saves from Baylor junior goalkeeper Jennifer Wandt to secure a tie for the Bears. McKeown shot a dart toward the goal and Hocking had a one-on-one, but Wandt saved both shots. 
Despite the tie, the Trojans still finished non-conference play at a program-best 7-0-1 while Baylor continues its non-conference play at 4-2-3.
With No. 3 Stanford visiting McAlister Field and a rocky last two non-conference games for the Trojans, McAlpine’s team must learn from these games and move forward. 
“This was great preparation going into conference play,” McAlpine told USC Athletics. “We’ll take that, and we’ll move forward.”
USC will open conference play this Saturday against Stanford at 1 p.m. on its home turf.

The USC Fisher Museum of Art and the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education opened its Fall 2019 exhibit “Facing Survival,” an interactive testament to Holocaust survivors, Wednesday. 
The collection, which will be held at Fisher until Dec. 7,  includes 14 paintings by international artist David Kassan and the “Dimensions in Testimony” holograms, or interactive biographies, of Holocaust survivors Eva Schloss and Pinchas Gutter, which can each answer questions about their experiences inside concentration camps during World War II. 
According to Executive Director of the USC Shoah Foundation Stephen Smith, several USC faculty and staff members have been working hard to make “Facing Survival” a reality. Smith said the project was conceived seven years ago when he conferred with a colleague who had a vision for the foundation’s role in a frightful near future where Holocaust survivors’ stories became lost and forgotten history. 
“[At the gallery’s opening ceremony] 10 Holocaust survivors were here, we got to speak to them, then they can tell us that story personally,” Smith said. “When they are no longer able to do that, how will you continue to [get visitors] deeply engaged? The idea behind [“Dimensions in Testimony”] is they can still tell their story.”
While the USC Shoah Foundation continues to add to its video archive of over 50,000 Holocaust survivor testimonies, “Dimensions in Testimony” aims to replicate a similar emotional connection through an interactive medium. This process is meant to be intimate, forcing visitors to think, ask questions and make connections between survivors’ experiences and injustice in the world today.
Smith said that the Schloss and Gutter interactive biographies are programmed to answer comprehensive questions about their history and that their responses are nothing like what students can find in a traditional textbook. When visitors speak into the exhibit microphone to ask their questions, they should feel as if they were having a conversation with a survivor who had just sat down to tell their tale, Smith said.
“I noticed in my own research that when survivors were telling their story, [students] would ask, ‘Do you hate the Germans? What they did to you? How do you feel when you see racism in the world today?’” Smith said. “And the questions were about the consequences.” 
Each interactive biography was made using 360-degree video footage. The virtual images of Schloss and Gutter will be available at Fisher on a rotating basis. 
Similar interactive biographies in “Dimensions in Testimony” created by developer Conscience Display have been exhibited in the Swedish History Museum and the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Selma Holo, director of the Fisher Gallery and a professor of art history, said visitors need to remember stories about the Holocaust because genocide and persecution are not things of the past.
“There’s been a whole change in the way people understand history,” Holo said. “There is the distance and the danger of forgetting.”
“Facing Survival” aims to make history accessible to a generation faced with diminishing eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust.
Kassan’s paintings, which fill most of the gallery space, represent another type of testimony in “Facing Survival.” Smith said that Kassan’s work affects viewers in part because it follows Shoah Foundation methodology and incorporates survivors’ stories into his work.
“He would sit with the survivors, talking, working with film and photographs — that is exactly what we do,” Smith said. “And in his case, the output is a piece of art. He gets the intensity of that story, which I think speaks through the artwork, because of his engagement with the survivors … I think he’s done justice to their legacy.”
Kassan started painting Holocaust survivor portraits when he asked a colleague if he could paint her parents; the project later grew into the series now on display at the Fisher Gallery. Kassan said that a single painting can take between two months and two years to complete.
“I just take my time,” Kazan said. “I’m not making products, I’m making paintings. They’re more about the experience as opposed to making something to sell. There’s a saying: the brushstroke lasts longer than the hand that made it, so these things are hopefully going to outlive me. And then if it takes me an extra month or a year to finish a painting, that’s worth it, because they’re going to live on way past me.”
Kassan, whose earlier work has been featured in the Smithsonian, does not think of himself as a portrait artist but rather as a painter with a wide range of interests who combines abstract and impressionist backgrounds with raw human figures as the subjects. He plans to continue painting Holocaust survivors because, as he says, listening to survivors’ testimonies makes painting them an intimate process. 
In attesting to the power of these testimonies, Kassan said that Eva Schloss’ story highlights how giving testimony has helped Holocaust survivors make peace with their own pasts. 
“There’s the whole spectrum of humanity, or how people deal with things,” Kassan said. “Some people lock it away. Other people were very angry, and they weren’t able to talk about it early in the 1960s and 1970s. And then when they started to talk, they lost that anger, and they actually became more compassionate human beings because they were able to discuss what happened.” 
Kassan and the USC staff and faculty who worked to bring “Facing Survival” to the museum want students to share the experiences they gain at the exhibit with others, including those on campus who have never visited the Fisher Museum. 
Currently, the Fisher Gallery is the only place visitors can interact with Schloss’ and Gutter’s interactive testimonies. Fisher will hold a series of remembrance and social justice events related to the Holocaust throughout the semester as part of its “Facing Survival” programming. The gallery is open to the public. 
“This is not your mother’s, your father’s or your grandparents’ museum,” Holo said. “If you come here, you’re going to see how we have embraced technology, how we’ve taken ancient techniques to portraiture and then made them come alive with the [interactive biographies]. It’s very powerful.”

The USC men’s tennis team played in the Battle in the Bay Classic and the Milwaukee Tennis Classic last weekend, picking up some impressive victories along the way. 
Junior Brandon Holt hoisted both the singles and doubles trophies in San Francisco, and sophomore Mor Bulis took home the singles crown in Milwaukee.
Following last weekend’s tournaments, head coach Brett Masi said he was pleased with the team’s showing at both events.
“Everything was positive in terms of seeing what the other guys did who didn’t win at Milwaukee — they had good tournaments, they had good runs, they beat some good players,” Masi said.  
After making it past the Round of 16 in the Battle in the Bay, Holt defeated TCU freshman Jacob Fearnley in two sets at Saturday’s quarterfinal by a score of 7-5, 6-4. He then advanced to the semifinal on Sunday where he squared off against fellow Trojan and senior Riley Smith.
The Battle of Troy was a close one. Holt won the first set 6-4, but the second set went to Smith by the same score. In the final set of the match, Holt had the upper hand with an excellent 6-1 victory, advancing to Sunday’s championship match. 
He defeated No. 2 seed  Michigan freshman Ondrej Styler handily 6-2, 6-4.
Over 2,000 miles east of Holt’s championship run, sophomores Mor Bulis, Jake Sands and Bradley Frye represented the Trojans in the Milwaukee Tennis Classic.
Bulis caught fire in the tournament. Following Friday’s Round of 64 victory, Bulis won both of his matches Saturday to advance to Sunday’s quarterfinal. He battled No. 2-seeded senior Giovanni Oradini from Mississippi State and took a commanding win 6-2, 6-4. In a much closer semifinal, Bulis outlasted UNLV senior Alex Kobelt 7-6 (1), 7-5.
On Monday, Bulis earned the Milwaukee Tennis Classic singles crown by defeating Notre Dame junior Richard Ciamarra 6-3, 6-2.
Sands and Frye enjoyed wins in the singles Rounds of 64 and 32; however, both were ultimately defeated in the Round of 16. Sands fell at the hands of California junior Jack Molloy 6-2, 6-3, while Frye received a 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 loss from No. 5 sophomore Paul Baretto, also of Cal. 
Bulis and Frye partnered up for the doubles tournament but were stopped short of victory in the Round of 16.
Back in the Bay, USC fared well in the doubles portion of the tournament. Holt and freshman Stefan Dostanic represented the Trojans alongside senior Riley Smith and freshman Ryder Jackson.
The two teams faced off during Sunday’s championship after both won tiebreaker sets to advance from the semifinals. In the end, Holt and Dostanic bested Smith and Jackson 8-2.
Among those to fall short in their respective tournaments were the two freshmen, Dostanic and Jackson.
In the singles Round of 32, Dostanic and Jackson won their respective matches and advanced to the Round of 16. It was in this round, however, that their tournament ended.
Dostanic lost his match 7-6 (4) to Stanford sophomore Sangreet Sridhar after a close tiebreaker, while Jackson lost his final set to Cal sophomore Yuta Kikuchi with a 6-4 score.
Despite the defeats, Masi spoke highly of their performances. 
“The freshmen just beat two boys who are No. 1 on their teams,” he said. “That’s pretty solid to show that two freshmen coming in here in their first tournament can go and do that.”
Masi’s faith in this talented men’s team is certainly no surprise after such a successful weekend. The freshmen’s play during the tournament showed their coach just how much potential this year’s team has. However, he says there is still work to be done. 
“There’s still a lot of things we can do better,” Masi said. “We’ll do that after we look back at this weekend and see what we can improve on.”
The Trojans look to maintain their strong start to the season with the Oracle ITA Masters in Malibu beginning Sept. 26.

Reds, blues and yellows line the hallways of the sixth floor of Fluor Tower Residential College, adorned with paintings of suns and moons done in the style of Mexican folk artists. From behind the doors of a few rooms peek Latin American flags and small trinkets. The space is home to El Sol y La Luna, a residential community dedicated solely to Latinx culture at USC that helps soften the transition to college for the small number of Latinx students attending the University. 
This lively environment is reflective of the residents themselves, who constantly visit one another’s rooms and embrace the Latin sense of community. 
“There is a deep sense of culture,”  said Ernesto Ortiz Zamora, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering. “I feel like we all have this open-door policy where we can really talk to one another.”
Roman Rodriguez, a freshman majoring in architecture, said living on the floor has allowed him to reconnect with his Latino heritage through weekly meetings, hangouts and talks. Rodriguez, who grew up in a military family and moved frequently, said he often felt cut off from his culture.
“I came across [El Sol y La Luna] when I was looking for housing options; I heard that there was a Latino floor, and I thought that was a good way for me to come back to the culture,” he said. “I didn’t grow up speaking Spanish, but most people here do at least understand it.” 
Other residents, like Selene Castillo, a freshman majoring in international relations, wanted to continue to feel connected to their heritage back home by finding a same similar of community at USC. 
“For me it was the opposite … I grew up speaking Spanish, it was my first language and I wanted to find that same family here,” Castillo said. 
Senior Director for Residential Education Emily Sandoval said these spaces create a community for students to connect with one another, learn about their identities and form relationships that will help them succeed during college.  
Sandoval also acknowledged that according to USC, the Latinx community only made up 15% of the student body in Fall 2018. Sandoval said that for that reason, these spaces are necessary to help students find and connect with one another and connect.  
“Starting college can be challenging for many students, but having a place to live where students can create a sense of family — having similar traditions and cultural backgrounds — can soften the experience,” Sandoval said.
But the floor does much more for its residents than simply help them find their niche. El Sol y La Luna collaborates frequently with La CASA, a Latinx organization on campus. Jennifer Arias, a freshman majoring in theater on the floor’s executive board, said they plan group outings to attend events on campus. Earlier this month, they coordinated an outing to a campus event that hosted John Leguizamo, a well-known Latino actor. La CASA also plans events for holidays like Día de los Muertos.
Billy Vela, the director of La CASA, said the floor also welcomes residents who don’t identify as Hispanic or Latinx as long as they’re willing to learn about new cultures.  
“The floor has also had non-Latinx members throughout the years, and the same goal [to successfully transition to USC] was set for them because all students living on the floor should feel like they belong by community connections being made on the floor,” Vela wrote in an email. 
Freshman computer engineering and computer science major Nick Imig, who is not Latino, was randomly assigned to El Sol y La Luna . 
“Even though we aren’t Latinos, they always try to include [me and my suitemates] in all their events,” he said. “They want us to be immersed in their culture too. Just the other night, one of them had their mom bringing us flan.” 
Imig’s suitemate, Carlos Casillas, identifies as Latino but said he didn’t choose to live on the Latinx floor — he was also randomly assigned. Casillas, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics & law, said he thinks residential communities can be isolating and limit students to one group of potential friends.

James Gray, a School of Cinematic Arts alumnus, is no stranger to making films about fathers and sons. His 2016 film, “The Lost City of Z,” tangentially explores the tenuous relationship between a workaholic father and his cloying son — but this year’s “Ad Astra” takes that theme to a whole new level.
“Ad Astra” takes place in a future where humans have colonized the moon, Mars and have even begun to explore other parts of the solar system. The movie follows Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), an astronaut lauded for his ability to keep his emotions under wraps. He’s a broken man — estranged from his family, emotionally repressed and utterly consumed by his work, an unending cycle of missions and incessant mandatory psychological examinations. 
His father, the esteemed H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), is a Neil Armstrong-level icon who is lost on a deep space exploration mission called “Project Lima.” When mysterious bursts of cosmic rays from Project Lima near Neptune disable technology all over Earth and its settlements, Roy is called in to investigate, kicking off a journey through the solar system and his tumultuous relationship with his father.
“Ad Astra” is a rare aligning of the stars, pairing a director at the height of his craft with an incredible late-career performance from one of the last bastions of classic movie stardom. 
Gray employs his particular brand of classical direction — a type of quiet formalism far more concerned with effectively and interestingly conveying the story than being stylish or flashy. He also borrows from different genres — the most memorable sequences in the movie are a horrific creature attack on an abandoned ship and a “Mad Max”-inspired ambush by moon pirates. The direction, paired with Hoyte van Hoytema’s stellar cinematography, makes the entire film a visual treat. Simple shots such as Major McBride walking down a hallway or traveling on a rover are elevated to magnificence, making the entire story feel like a modern epic.
Brad Pitt, who has already enjoyed a great year with his lauded role in “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” is also at the top of his game here, giving a mostly silent performance that forces him to be extremely expressive. There is one scene in particular where he valiantly attempts to hold back tears while recording a message for his father. It seems destined to be his Best Actor in a Leading Role clip. 
The script, written by Gray and Ethan Gross, deftly deconstructs Major McBride, exploring the conflict between father and son and how toxic masculinity can be passed on. “In the end, the son suffers the sins of the father,” muses McBride in a voiceover on his way to Neptune to meet the source of his troubles.
Prior to release, “Ad Astra” had its fair share of production drama, resulting in some elements of the film being clunkier than others. It was initially slated to be released this January, but wasn’t completed, so Fox pushed it to May. Then, when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox, they again pushed it to September, ordering a fair number of reshoots. These were probably ordered to add in the voiceover that permeates the film and, unfortunately, tends to over-explain moments that may have resonated more if they were left silent. 
The end product, however, is a true masterpiece. Although on the surface it is easy to compare “Ad Astra” to the string of contemplative sci-fi movies that have come out in the past decade — “Interstellar,” “Arrival” and “The Martian” come to mind — it is more indebted to films like “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “Solaris” and “Blade Runner: 2049.”
“Ad Astra” is an exercise in a type of quiet, contemplative cinema that uses the vastness of space to comment on the delicate minutiae of the human spirit and to get at something more ineffable about the human condition.

 A smile comes across my face whenever I hear 702’s “Get it Together” fade into “I put the new Forgis on the Jeep.” “Ballin’” isn’t the rapper’s victory lap or celebratory dunk — it’s a warm-up track.
For those who don’t know, there is a host of reasons to be proud of Roddy Ricch. Aside from being another rapper on the rise, the 20-year-old already has a feature on Meek Mill’s “Championships” and two mixtapes to his name. His career has just started its marathon. 
“Ballin’” comes after the brutally honest “Die Young” and an ode to his late friend “Ricch Forever.” A common theme in the Compton-born Ricch’s music is the threat of early death or incarceration, a fate he’s all too familiar with. But “Ballin’” goes beyond detailing the come up, it celebrates the successes. 
In an interview with MTV News, Ricch talked about his future plans. “I want to buy more property, start a couple of small businesses, and if my cousin wants to go to college, I want to put him through with ease,” he said. 
“Ballin’” is the lyrical representation of these hopes and dreams. He’s detailing what he can do through the success of his art. 
Twitter user @MrSirCool, calls it a “fuckin negro spiritual,” and I could not agree more. If we could rework the definition of it to fit into today’s musical landscape, it wouldn’t solely include the “struggle” or the pursuit of freedom; it would taste like happiness and success⁠ — a sentiment that Mustard and Ricch capture on the track. 
The rags-to-riches celebration is almost standard material for most rappers. Think about all 12 minutes of Kanye’s “Last Call,” Cole’s “Blow Up” or Biggie’s quintessential “Juicy.” They are stories of “the come-up,” deeper than surface-level lyrics about ostentatious glamour, but they are ultimately tales heavily rooted in the art of the hustle. 
The Rolls-Royces, the cash and Audemars Piguet watches we hear of are more than boastful mentions of material possessions. The lyrics are signifiers of how far not only their individual lives have come but how the genre of hip-hop has developed as a whole. 
Just as Ricch has moved beyond but has never forgotten his native Wilmington Arms projects, hip-hop has progressed past 1520 Sedgwick Ave. It has widened beyond a form of expression for urban Black youth rooted in DJ culture and conscious lyrics to detailing not only their struggle but their victories. 
One of the most common critiques of songs like Ricch’s and the genre as a whole in its modern-day context is the same element that exemplifies moving beyond the struggle: materialism. 
I think about when Miley Cyrus distanced herself from hip-hop in 2017. Describing seemingly superficial lyrics rap songs she says, “That’s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much ‘Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock’ — I am so not that.”
At the surface level, her criticism can seem valid; she wants substance in her music and the current climate of the genre didn’t provide that for her. But when one thinks about where and how Ricch grew up compared to Cyrus’ life, much is lost in translation. 
A girl who grew up a Disney Channel star, with Billy Ray Cyrus as a father might not understand what it means or what it feels like to make it out of the projects. The feeling of touching money and that level of success was an attainable trajectory for Cyrus. For Black youth like Ricch, the same that is not necessarily true. 
Noting the differences in their upbringing and paths to success are not commentaries on Cyrus’ or Ricch’s talent but on the set of circumstances like the school-to-prison pipeline and other facets of institutional racism that have prevented those who look like Ricch from reaching their full potential. 
From Cyrus’ perspective and position of privilege, the talk of material items is boring and peripheral. But for Ricch it’s not just about the “stuff.” The stuff represents how hard he’s worked and the situations he’s overcome. 
Hip-hop as a genre has often been criticized for being too loud and boastful for a world that is hell-bent on subjugation, not the celebration of Black lives. But a classic rags-to-riches anthem tells a different story than the common narrative seen on CNN, NBC, Fox, etc. It’s the people’s honor roll.
And in the same way, The New York Times riddled Lorde’s anti-bling “Royals” as a “class-conscious” anthem, Ricch’s “Ballin’” is too. He’s loud about his triumphs and he’s not afraid to stunt. It’s the perfect song to wake up to and face the day. It’s about where the grind can take you.

Following its three-win performance at the Trojan Invitational — including a sweep of Villanova, which entered the game with a 5-1 record on the season — No. 20 women’s volleyball fell to San Diego 3-2 Thursday before swiftly defeating Long Beach State 3-0 Friday.
The match against San Diego was a tough fight throughout the full five sets. USD won the first two sets, and USC struggled to keep up given the Toreros’ effective blocking. However, the Trojans stayed resilient after going down 2-0 and were able to battle back in the third and fourth sets to tie it up 2-2. 
The fifth set was tight, but USC fell behind 14-11 due to an overturned call. The Trojans couldn’t come back from the deficit, losing 15-13 and ending in a three-games-to-two loss. 
Senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier had a season-high 18 kills along with 19.5 points against the Toreros.
USC regained its strength in the second game of the week against Long Beach State. The Trojans had 15 kills and four aces in the first set, taking it 25-21. They easily won the second set 25-11 with an additional 15 kills. The third set proved to be more difficult, but USC held the lead, finishing the sweep 25-20. 
Lanier led the Trojans in the second match with 20 points and 17 kills. Junior outside hitter Brooke Botkin had a career high with six kills, six digs and four of the Trojans’ 12 service aces. 
Head coach Brent Crouch was proud of the effort his squad displayed despite injuries and is confident in its abilities going forward.
“We are not 100% [health-wise],” Crouch said. “We are getting there … We are looking forward to getting everyone practicing at 100% and really [hitting] the Pac-12 schedule in stride.” 
This is USC’s third 3-0 sweep this season, and it hopes to carry this momentum into Pac-12 play beginning Wednesday against UCLA. The Bruins were swept in their last two matches by No. 11 Hawaii and UC Santa Barbara, while the Trojans enter conference play ranked No. 25 in the nation.
With 10 of their 20 remaining matches coming against ranked opponents, the squad will be challenged to respond to adversity as it has done early on this season if it wants to build on last year’s strong performance.

A Rance’s Chicago Pizza co-owner is speaking out after the restaurant closed its USC Village location earlier this month amid an ongoing lawsuit against the University.
Rance’s and The Butcher, the Baker and the Cappuccino Maker, another restaurant in the USC Village that shut its doors this semester, are suing the University for promissory fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. The store owners allege USC told tenants that students would be allowed to use dining dollars to pay for meals and claimed the University never told them there would be a dining hall in USC Village. 
Aaron Tofani, co-owner of Rance’s and a 2011 Price School of Public Policy alumnus, said the restaurant, which runs two other locations in Southern California, never turned a profit at its USC Village location. 
“We had no choice but to close,” Tofani said. “We couldn’t afford to pay the rent because [it was] pretty high relative to the amount of sales that we were able to generate partially due to the significant amount of competition and other factors on the project.” 
Tofani said the University didn’t disclose information about the establishment of the USC Village Dining Hall, which he said took away many of the restaurants’ potential customers. 
“When you’re on [financial aid] and then you have to buy these meal plans, you don’t have a lot of extra spending money,” he said. “We were under the impression that we were going to have access to the USC Card. Being on campus it made perfect sense, and the students have been asking for it, too.” 
USC denied the claims made in the lawsuit regarding dining dollars and the dining hall.
“The University believes the allegations that Rance’s and BBCM have made in their lawsuit are inaccurate, and we will vigorously defend against them in court,” USC wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
The University also wrote that it had filed a separate court action against Rance’s for falling behind on its rent payments over the last several months. Tofani confirmed the restaurant had failed to pay its rent on time for two months. 
Tofani said Rance’s worked on a new business deal with USC over the summer when the University wanted them to sign off on a clause that would exempt the school from any current and future claims the restaurant had.
He and his co-owner began going through past documents and said they hadn’t reached their profit projections because of the promises left unfulfilled by the University. Other tenants they talked to had similar experiences, he said. 
The tenants were afraid to come together because when they wrote draft letters on the issues in May 2018 and early 2019, a USC Real Estate and Asset Management executive allegedly threatened Rance’s and other tenants against signing the letter, Tofani said.
When the tenants started talking to one another, Tofani said they realized they had similar stories about the University’s promises compared with their actual profit numbers.
“We’ve been set up in a situation where USC is acting as the banker with all these mealing plans, and they’re acting as the landlord, and they’re also the competition with the dining hall,” he said. “We just realized that there’s no way to succeed here.”
When BBCM closed its doors last month, the University told the Daily Trojan that it expects to see retailers in USC Village change over time. 
“It is common for retailers and restaurants to make business-based decisions about when to leave a location,” the statement read. “Ongoing change is expected as USC Village continues to partner with retailers and restaurants to provide the best mix of services for the University and the community.”
BBCM said in the suit that the REAM executive framed the dining dollars as a selling point because it would bring a “significant boost” in revenue and used Seeds, another storefront at USC that accepts dining dollars, as an example. 
Rance’s and other USC Village tenants continued asking for permission to accept dining dollars in their restaurants but were denied each time, the suit read. Rance’s and BBCM also said the University promised USC Village would hold farmer’s markets, tailgates and other events to draw traffic from the local community. Instead, Tofani said that during the summer and holiday breaks, USC Village vendors made little profit. 
Tofani said Rance’s had relied on revenue from its other locations to help retain the USC Village restaurant, and he hopes the lawsuit will help pay for the seven figures in losses he said Rance’s gave up since the location opened in December 2017. He also said he hopes the University will improve conditions for other stores at USC Village by beginning to accept dining dollars and hosting community events that draw in customers during breaks in the school year. 
“The [USC Village] is a ghost town when the students and the workers are all gone for the winter,” Tofani said. “That three weeks, you can have a cool experience for the community. Make the parking free, invite them in and they might discover their new favorite restaurant.”

Three weeks of the NFL season are in the books, and I know what you’re thinking: How do we know which hot-starting teams are contenders and which are pretenders? What are the big games to keep an eye on these next two weeks? Worry not, dear reader, you’ve come to the right place; this week’s deep dive will answer all these questions and more. 
Let’s start by looking at each team that has made it through the first three weeks undefeated, along with how likely I believe it is that they make the playoffs.
Kansas City Chiefs
Combined record of opponents: 4-5 
Head coach Andy Reid has built a video game offense in real life, and it seems no one has the answer for stopping it. I came across this bizarre statistic, courtesy of Scott Barrett with Pro Football Focus: In just the first half of games, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is averaging 300 yards and 2.7 touchdowns through the air. Extrapolate those numbers over a season and you get 4,800 yards and 43 touchdowns. That’s only been done six times in NFL history by a few guys named Dan Marino, Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Mahomes himself last year. Can you imagine what those numbers would be if he needed to keep his foot on the gas in the second half? Playoff chances: 95%
New England Patriots
Combined record of opponents: 0-9
Raise your hand if you’re surprised the Patriots are off to a 3-0 start. No one? That’s what I thought. The biggest story for New England has been the turmoil wide receiver Antonio Brown brought to town, but those days are over. After his release Friday, it looks as though Brown won’t be on an NFL roster ever again. This team will very likely cruise into the playoffs regardless — they’ve got an easy schedule up until a five-game stretch in November and December where they’ll play the Ravens, Eagles, Cowboys, Texans and Chiefs. Playoff chances: 90%
Los Angeles Rams
Combined record of opponents: 4-5
The Rams have the most impressive three wins among the undefeated teams with two road victories and a win in their NFC title game rematch with the Saints. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp’s return has been the key to unlocking the Rams’ offensive potential, and head coach Sean McVay spent the offseason designing plays to overcome the offensive woes that limited the Rams to 3 points in last year’s Super Bowl. The NFC West is looking very competitive this year, but this team isn’t going anywhere. Playoff chances: 85%
Dallas Cowboys
Combined record of opponents: 1-7
The Cowboys’ new offense continues to impress. Quarterback Dak Prescott is leading the league in quarterback rating, ESPN’s most thorough efficiency rating, and has the second-most touchdown passes behind Mahomes. Thanks to a rash of injuries and bad luck affecting the Eagles, Dallas already has a two-game lead in its division, which will be difficult to overcome down the stretch. Jerry Jones probably likes his playoff chances right now, but I still have the Cowboys slightly below the Rams since their wins are less impressive. Playoff chances: 80%
I’d be surprised if any of the above teams missed the playoffs, but the jury is still out on the remaining undefeated teams. 
Green Bay Packers
Combined record of opponents: 3-5
The Pack has not looked particularly sharp in any of its games, but it’s found a way to stay undefeated. This offense is far from clicking on all cylinders — Aaron Rodgers’ quarterback rating is below that of Jaguars’ sixth round rookie Gardner Minshew, and star wide receiver Davante Adams has also underperformed. They also face some stiff competition within the NFC North and some tough tests in the coming weeks, including games against the Eagles, Cowboys, Chiefs and Chargers. The early leg up will help their playoff chances given the challenging stretch ahead. Playoff chances: 55%
Buffalo Bills
Combined record of opponents: 1-8
With a strong defense and some timely playmaking by quarterback Josh Allen, the Bills have looked better than expected. They’ve faced three unimpressive offenses, but they’ve been taking care of business, holding them to under 5 yards per play. The Bills’ schedule will get more difficult, but they have enough winnable games — including two against the Dolphins — to grab one of the two AFC wild card spots. Playoff chances: 50%
San Francisco 49ers
Combined record of opponents: 1-8
It appears quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo is back to his winning ways after returning from tearing his ACL last season. He hovers around the league average in quarterback rating and found a way to win against the Buccaneers despite conceding five turnovers. The NFC West might be the strongest division in football, and the 49ers still have to face the Rams and Seahawks twice apiece. The Niners still have much to prove, but they’ll be alright if head coach Kyle Shanahan can continue his offensive wizardry. Playoff chances: 45%
Detroit Lions
Combined record of opponents: 2-6-1
With two wins and a tie, the Lions are technically still undefeated, and they’ve mustered wins over good teams in the Chargers and Eagles. They’d be 3-0 if they could’ve just held on against Arizona Week 1. Matthew Stafford appears to have rebounded from a down year, and the defense has come up with big stops in both wins. However, the Lions have three tough divisional opponents, and it won’t be easy to grab a wild card in the NFC. Playoff chances: 30%

During the school year, USC students can engage in the news cycle as much or as little as they choose by attending political panels, discussing current events in class, speaking directly with professors or becoming involved in one of the many campus groups devoted to civic engagement. 
But what do these students do outside of USC? What about after graduation? It’s understandable to be overwhelmed by the multitude of political conversations. It’s a lot like being in a crowded room at a party: Everyone is speaking loudly, and everyone has a lot to say, but why is it imperative that we keep listening? 
Here’s why: Serious issues like climate change, immigration, healthcare, gun control and prison reform are about to become problems specific to Generation Z. This generation has a chance to make tangible changes before these problems become irreversible. It has  a hand in reshaping the political fabric of our country through voting. 
Fortunately, many young voters are passionate and invested in civic engagement and thus invested in their futures. The most impressive statistics came from the 2018 midterms, which were indicative of just how much the youth vote can influence pivotal races across the country. Even though only 31% of eligible 18- to 29-year-olds participated, it was the highest midterm showing in 25 years. It also resulted in the most racially and ethnically diverse Congress in history. Given the high engagement level for 2018, 2020 is predicted to include more young voters than ever before. This is especially noteworthy because they will comprise 40% of the electorate. Young voters do have power, and their actions are already changing the political landscape. 
In the short term, checking out or stepping away may not be a big deal, but it’s simply not enough to scroll through Twitter or Instagram for news every now and then. Social media is becoming the primary news source for younger voters, with most of Gen Z relying on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. Social media provides a quick take on the news, but it’s difficult to find clarity in a landscape where viewers are constantly bombarded with information. 
We need young voters who are informed enough to make educated decisions in the voting booths. This year, VoteSC, a new nonpartisan campus organization dedicated to registering students to vote and demystifying the registration process, launched a comprehensive website and social media campaign to keep students informed, educated and ready for the 2020 election. Last year, the organization engaged over 2,000 students in the registration process. Sept. 24 marks one of its largest efforts this fall: National Voter Registration Day. In collaboration with Undergraduate Student Government, the Political Student Assembly, USC Dornsife Center for the Political Future and Unruh Associates, VoteSC will be on Trousdale from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., encouraging students to register and ask questions about the voting process. 
Clearly, there are politically active organizations doing important  work on campus to promote civic engagement. PSA, Center for the Political Future and Unruh Institute are active throughout the school year, putting on informational events, organizing voter registration drives and providing opportunities for community involvement on and off campus. Additionally, there are many options for students not involved in these organizations to stay engaged year round.
USG provides students with free digital subscriptions to The New York Times, offering a comprehensive and well-researched account of the news. For those hoping for a trimmed down version of The New York Times, there’s “The Daily,” a short podcast diving into single subjects with more detail, or the “Morning Briefing,” a morning newsletter in highlights of important issues. “TheSkimm” is a great daily newsletter service presenting readers with a basic understanding of both news and the election cycle. At USC, Annenberg Media’s “The Rundown” provides an overview of the week’s biggest stories, easily watchable on your phone or readable in a weekly newsletter. 
As the school year progresses, students are faced with a new task: finding an online service, a newspaper, an account, a podcast, a show or a website they trust. With one of our country’s most divisive elections barreling toward us, it’s time to arm ourselves with knowledge and vote. The ballot box is one of our most powerful tools.

Felicity Huffman — the first person charged in the college admissions scheme — was sentenced to two weeks in federal prison Sept. 13. She will also pay a $30,000 fine and commit to 250 hours of community service. 
Many on Twitter went berserk over what they called a light sentence and a failure of the justice system to apply the law equally to all citizens. Several blue checkmarks on the site gave examples of objectively less severe crimes being punished with objectively much harsher sentences. 
These pundits are angry that Huffman did not receive a stringent enough punishment because of her white privilege and high social class. While certainly true, framing the issue this way misses the mark. The justice system isn’t wrong to sentence Huffman “lightly;” it is wrong in punishing others too harshly. Yes, we should be talking about the inequities in the justice system, but the focus needs to be on those harmed unfairly, not benefited unfairly. It’s the media’s responsibility to report and bring to light cases when prosecutors overcharge, when judges over-sentence and when juries convict despite insufficient evidence. 
The Huffman case brings to light a fundamental question about the justice system’s purpose: Is it a means to a better society, or does it exist solely to punish and seek vengeful retribution against criminals? Suggesting these two be true simultaneously is misguided. California’s prison system is administered by an agency dubbed the “Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,” but prison cells don’t correct wrongs. And, in most cases, they surely don’t rehabilitate. Prisons are a reflection of our society. They exist because our society values revenge over forgiveness, coercion over correction and penalty over mercy.  
Punishing someone does not benefit society. Study after study shows that harsher punishment does not deter crime. And the act of punishing clearly fails to rehabilitate because over 60% of California inmates will return to prison within three years of being released. A 2019 report released by the California State Auditor acknowledged that the state’s attempt at rehabilitation has failed well over half of the inmates released in 2017-18. It is illogical to argue that locking someone behind bars for dozens of years and then throwing them back out into a radically changed society with a few hundred bucks and a permanent criminal record will do them any good.  
Malcolm X put it best when he wrote, “I am not saying there shouldn’t be prisons, but there shouldn’t be bars. Behind bars, a man never reforms.” 
Of course, prisons serve an important purpose in keeping the public safe, especially from violent criminals. But the reality is that the public would be just as safe if we spent as much money keeping people out of prison as we spend putting people in prison. Few people truly deserve prison. Too often, the justice system looks at the actions someone did as opposed to the individual’s motivations. An analysis of a person’s motivation will typically show incitement stemming from drug problems, mental health issues, abuse or a different societal failure against that individual. Rarely is someone truly “bad to the bone” with the only solution being locking him away.  
Sending Huffman to prison doesn’t really benefit society. It’s also unlikely it will deter others from acting similarly in the future. Societal pressure and condemnation will prove to have a more potent impact on the college admissions scandal than any number of days behind bars. 
John Legend summed this up well — and made it fit with 280 characters: “I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one. The answer isn’t for X to get more; it’s for both of them to get less (or even none!!!). We should level down not up.”
