Four Trojans from the men’s basketball program are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Sam Barry, Jack Gardner, Alex Hannum and Bill Sharman. This weekend, there will be significantly more.
In progress · Freshman guard Maurice Jones is averaging 18.3 points per game, but shot only six-of-15 in USC’s loss against Rider on Wednesday. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
As a result of competing in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament, the Trojans (2-1) will take a tour of the Hall of Fame on Friday in Springfield, Mass., allowing them to witness the plaques honoring former Trojans.
After visiting the “Hoop Hall,” the Trojans will play two games in two days at the MassMutual Center, located just minutes from the Basketball Hall of Fame.
On Saturday, USC will play Bradley. The game will be the first road contest for the Trojans and the Braves (3-0).
The Braves are coming off a narrow victory against Loyola-Marymount, who beat the Trojans last season in the Galen Center.
Less than 22 hours after tip-off against the Braves, the Trojans play New Mexico State Sunday afternoon. The Aggies (2-1) are a high-scoring team, averaging 94 points per game in their first two games. As a team, the Aggies shoot 43.5 percent from 3-point territory, and 52 percent overall.
More than a quarter of the Aggies’ points have come from forward Troy Gillenwater. Gillenwater is averaging 25.5 points per game, and has made seven of his 13 3-point attempts. He leads the team with an average of eight rebounds per game.
The Trojans are hoping to play better in the tournament’s final two games than they did in the first. On Wednesday, the Trojans lost at home to Rider, 77-57. The Broncs (2-1) shot 60 percent from the field, and 63.2 percent from beyond the 3-point arc, while USC only made 37.7 percent of its shots and one of its 15 3-point attempts.
“We obviously have a lot of growing up to do,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “In my two years, that was the worst we have been defensively. To give up 60 percent is unacceptable.”
The young Trojans, who have three freshman playing significant minutes — forward Garrett Jackson and guards Maurice Jones and Bryce Jones — hope to use the first road trip of the season as a chance to regroup and bond as a team.
“It seemed like nothing went right [against Rider],” senior forward Alex Stepheson said. “Hopefully we can learn from that and get some wins on the road.”
USC is three games into a stretch of eight games in 17 days, the most games the Trojans have had in a 17-day period since the 1983-1984 season. Depth has been an issue for USC, with only seven players earning any playing time. Against Rider, the third game in a five-day stretch, the Trojans seemed fatigued. Maurice Jones, Bryce Jones and junior forward Nikola Vucevic — who all average 32 or more minutes per game — entered the Rider game averaging a combined 56 points per game, and yet only managed to score 27 against the Broncs.
The Trojans return home to face Cal State Fullerton on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

To Loko or not to Loko?
That was the question.
On Wednesday, the FDA issued a warning to manufacturers of alcoholic energy drinks that effectively banned such products in their current state, following a one-year study on the harmful effects such beverages have on the body.
The announcement came on the heels of a recent wave of state-wide bans implemented across the nation.
While Four Loko was not the only beverage mentioned in the study, it has been the subject of intense scrutiny following several incidents in which those who consumed the drink were hospitalized or seriously injured.
Phusion Projects Inc. has already modified its flagship beverage, announcing that the Four Loko will no longer be produced with caffeine, taurine or guarana.
But many are up in arms, calling such measures “Prohibition-like,” with others speculating that such regulations will only encourage people to seek out their own haphazard ways to replicate the “blackout in a can.”
All things considered, we want to know:
Do you agree with the FDA’s hardline stance on caffeinated alcoholic beverages?

The regular season is quickly coming to an end, and with just three matches left, the No. 6 Women of Troy are hoping to come away with three wins away from home.
USC has its final big road trip this weekend, as it heads north to face Oregon State tonight followed by No. 23 Oregon on Saturday.
“We’re ready to go on this trip. We’d really like to go up there and try to get two wins if we can,” said USC coach Mick Haley.
The Women of Troy already beat both of these teams at the Galen Center this season. The team swept Oregon State in three sets on Oct. 23. USC also defeated the Ducks, but it was a more difficult task. USC went up 2-0 but lost the next two games, eventually coming away with the win in five sets.
Despite past success against these teams, Haley is not overconfident about his team’s upcoming matches.
“I can’t tell you that I think anything’s going to be easy this weekend,” he said.
Though Oregon State has an overall record of 8-20 and is just 1-13 in the Pac-10, when asked about the Beavers, Haley only had good things to say.
“They’re maybe the best blocking team in the conference right now, and they’ll use that at home to get the fans going,” Haley said. “They’ll be very, very loud, so we expect a much better match from them than we had last time.”
Saturday’s task will not be any easier for USC. The Ducks are 6-8 in conference play and look to improve this record as their season winds down.
“They know that they have to have at least some big wins here in the end to get a better seed in the NCAA tournament, so we really have to win the serving and passing game if we can,” Haley said. “We expect a really tough match in Eugene.”
With the season getting down to the wire, and USC playing in a stacked Pac-10 conference with seven ranked teams, it’s reasonable to think the players, especially the six freshmen, might be feeling the pressure. But Haley doesn’t seem to think his youngsters are intimidated.
“We’ve got them pretty well focused,” Haley said. “They don’t have much time to think about pressure.”
The Women of Troy are coming off two wins last weekend against Arizona State and Arizona, who was ranked No. 20. It seems USC might be peaking at the right time.
“The team’s done very well this week,” Haley said. “We’re looking for two really big matches.”
With only two weekends left, Haley hopes the team’s recent performance will carry over into the next few games.
“[We’ll] try to win the last three,” he said. “See if we can maintain this momentum into the tournament and get the best seed we can possibly get.”
Both of USC’s matches this weekend start at 7 p.m.

After spending their last four weeks in the greater Los Angeles area, the Trojans take to the road this weekend for their season finale at No. 6 UC Irvine.
But despite 17 consecutive victories against the Anteaters, including a 14-10 win during the NorCal Tournament in September, a road win is not guaranteed for the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (22-2, 5-3).
“[UCI has] played some of the top teams very closely,” said USC coach Jovan Vavic. “They have beaten tough teams. They have a winning record in conference; they’re 4-3 and they’re very dangerous. Their strength is experience, and they’re even more dangerous at home.”
Through eight home games, UC Irvine has posted seven wins, one of the best home records in the country, and in recent weeks, notched a 7-6 win over No. 7 UC Santa Barbara at Anteater Pool.
Despite the aforementioned challenge of winning on the road, however, a win remains crucial for the Trojans’ postseason hopes.
With a victory, USC can sew up the No. 2 seed in next week’s MPSF Tournament provided top-ranked California can defeat Stanford in its regular-season finale Friday.
A loss, though, and the Trojans could stumble all the way to fifth in the conference.
“Absolutely seeding matters,” Vavic said. “It’s a big game for an NCAA at-large berth as well. Every conference game is big, and it’s no different in this one.”
If a win is on the horizon, the Trojans will need production from an offense averaging 13.38 goals per game — the best in the country, yet one that has had its fair share of struggles as of late, with a seven-goal showing as recently as a week ago against Pepperdine.
Yet, Vavic remains unfazed with his unusually young unit.
“Seven goals is not bad, as long as you keep your opponent under six,” said the Trojans’ coach of 16 years. “I’m really not concerned about our offense. I think it has plenty of power to score. We really just need to stay focused.”
In its most recent outing, a 10-4 win over No. 9 Long Beach State, the Trojans showed a glimpse of their offensive capabilities.
Freshman driver Nikola Vavic notched a hat trick, his 12th multi-goal game of the year, while the offense went on a five-goal run in the first half to break up an early 1-1 tie.
Nikola Vavic and fellow freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie have combined for a total of 73 goals on the year, and although 21 players have found the back of the net at least once in 2010, it has been the freshman duo that has largely kept the team afloat.
“Our team is definitely capable,” Jovan Vavic said. “We showed that in the NorCal and SoCal Tournaments we can be really successful.”
But despite USC’s offensive prowess, a strong defensive performance will be necessary against a UC Irvine team that features two of the Pac-10’s best seniors: driver Brandon Johnson and two-meter Griffen Lerman, who have amassed a combined 80 goals on the season.
With a young team, however, it’s tough to overlook a postseason run, which is scheduled to begin with the MPSF Tournament in Palo Alto, Calif., on Nov. 26.
“We have so many young players who have not been in this situation before, so we’re trying to prepare them [for] what these tournaments are going to be like,” Vavic said. “Our focus needs to be at the highest level.”
THIS IS OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL TEAM AND PROGRAM ON CAMPUS.  WE ALL OUGHT TO PAY THEM TRIBUTE BY ATTENDING THEIR EXCITING GAMES.
COACH JOVAN IS AMAZING!!!  HE RECRUITS, COACHES, AND IS A SUPER GUY.   PLEASE BEAT UCI.
I WILL BE AT MPSF…. IN PALO ALTO.   WE MUST GET TO FINALS….TO GET AT LARGE BIRTH…..
OR WIN AND GET AUTO BIRTH IN FINAL 4 IN BERKELEY DEC 4&5……
THE MPSF IS THE TOUGHEST EVER.   THE  BEST 7 TEAMS IN USA ARE IN THE MPSF….

In the midst of an up-and-down campaign on the field for his football team, USC coach Lane Kiffin is quietly doing what he does best off of it: recruiting.
With scholarship reductions set to kick in once the NCAA decides on USC’s sanctions appeal, this year’s recruiting season might be the Trojans’ last chance to bring in a full class for several seasons.
USC’s coaches are off to a good start: 16 high school seniors have already verbally committed to play their college ball for the Trojans.
Although nothing is written in black ink just yet — National Signing Day isn’t until February — it is likely that most of the 16 will suit up for the Trojans next season.
USC fans certainly have reason to be excited.
De’Anthony Thomas, a senior at Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, headlines the class. Recruited as an Athlete by USC, the 5-foot-9, 160-pound standout is a five-star recruit at both running back and defensive back.
Defensive end Jalen Grimble of Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas, Nev., the cousin of USC freshman tight end Xavier Grimble, is ranked the No. 4 player at his position by Scout.com.
Wideout Victor Blackwell, a speedster from Mater Dei in Santa Ana, Calif., will add to USC’s already impressive young wide receiving core led by freshman Robert Woods.
The Trojans also snagged verbal commitments from two of the nation’s top four pro-style quarterbacks as ranked by Rivals.com. Max Wittek, a teammate of Blackwell’s at Mater Dei, and Cody Kessler of Centennial High School in Bakersfield, Calif., will likely compete with current USC freshman Jesse Scroggins to replace Matt Barkley, once the sophomore ultimately heads to the NFL.
The real headliners, though, play at a much more underappreciated position.
With this class, the Trojan coaching staff seems to finally be addressing USC’s need for a stronger kicking game.
Kicker Joe Houston’s struggles this season have been well-documented. The senior has made just seven-of-13 field goals while his longest make came from only 34 yards. A former walk-on who transferred from El Camino Junior College and just earned a USC scholarship this year, it’s hard to blame Houston for not being one of the nation’s top kickers.
USC simply hasn’t been able to recruit elite high school kickers during the last several years. In fact, the last time the Trojans brought in a kicker or punter directly from high school was way back in 2005, when Troy Van Blarcom came to USC from Orange Lutheran.
Enter Andre Heidari of Stockdale High School in Bakersfield, Calif.
Scout.com ranks the 5-foot-11 kicker as the nation’s top recruit at his position. Heidari committed to the Trojans in June after attending a kicking camp at USC.
Heidari has connected on six of his nine field goal attempts this season for Stockdale, including a 50-yarder last week in his school’s homecoming game. He’s also made kicks this season from 47, 44 and 41 yards.
Heidari said he plans to graduate in December and enroll at USC for the spring semester.
Senior Jacob Harfman has done a respectable job handling the punting and kickoff duties for the last two seasons. USC is tied for 21st in the nation with 14 touchbacks on kickoffs.
Harfman, though, will graduate this year and leaves no apparent heir to take over as the Trojans’ starting punter.
That’s where Kris Albarado of St. Louis Catholic in Lake Charles, La., comes in.
Ranked the No. 5 punter in the nation by Scout.com, Albarado committed to USC two weeks ago.
Albarado is averaging just less than 48 yards per punt for his high school team, besting Harfman’s 42.5 yard average for the Trojans. Gifted with a strong leg, Albarado has booted punts this season of 65, 62 and 61 yards.
It’s much too early to say that Heidari and Albarado will vastly improve USC’s kicking game. Heck, it’s not even a sure thing that these two will honor their verbal commitments and play for the Trojans.
It can be said, however, that by aggressively recruiting these two kicking prodigies, Kiffin and the rest of the USC coaches are putting their best feet forward.

USC Athletic Director Pat Haden confirmed weeks of speculation on Thursday, officially announcing that the university will introduce a Division I women’s lacrosse team for the 2012-2013 season.
“Women’s lacrosse is another opportunity to showcase the talents of young women, who we hope will come play for us and win us a national championship,” Haden said on Thursday.
Women’s lacrosse will become USC’s 21st NCAA sport, and its 12th women’s sport. Although lacrosse has a presence on campus in the form of men’s and women’s club teams, USC has never been represented at the Division I level.
Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson said the decision to add the team was a well-thought-out process, adding that it was important to ensure that the new sport would carry the same weight and attention from the athletic department that all of USC’s other D-I sports demand.
“USC likes to do things in a first-class way, and that’s exactly the way this will be approached,” Jackson said. “We’re not taking this lightly by any means. This is hugely important to both [USC president C. L. Max Nikias] and [Haden] as one of their first initiatives athletically, and we’re going go about this just like we go about all of our 21 sports.”
Lacrosse’s rise began on the East Coast, but has grown rapidly in popularity across the United States and has spread westward as more and more universities embrace the sport.
“It’s really exciting — if you look at the sport itself, Max and Pat and the department recognize this trend in participation amongst lacrosse players in California and nationally,” Jackson said. “It was a brilliant move — the timing of this sport, our campus, our brand, our academic profile, the kind of kids we’re going to recruit. It all just fits right.”
Jackson also noted the important role that Haden played in creating the team.
“Haden was integral,” he said. “In just a few months time to turn around a program like this is certainly indicative of what he’s about and where he sees the department headed.”
The decision came as no surprise, considering the team was unofficially announced almost two months ago by Nikias. The official announcement was pending while the athletic department searched for a coach, though one has not yet been selected.
The team will join the Mountain Pacific Sports Conference as its seventh team. Competing in the MPSF already are Stanford, Oregon, UC-Davis, Fresno State, Denver and St. Mary’s.
In Syracuse, NY the school with the most national championships for Lacrosse they get crowds of 10,000 plus for lacrosse.  Definitely a money maker for the school.
Wouldn’t it be a better idea to have a Men’s Division 1 team first? That way the school could see the excitement of Division 1 Lacrosse, and reward the club team members, before being relegated to a “Losing money Women’s team.” Instead they are just creating another program to balance the Title IX problems with the Men’s Football team.
Seems like the Male Lacrosse club athletes are being ignored out of “Political Correctness,” and that’s not fair.
I agree.  If you are going to add a sport, you should add it for both men and women.  I think it’s ridiculous not to have a Men’s Soccer or Women’s Softball team as well.  Softball at least would have fit into the Pac-10 already.
Double Agree,
     In Syracuse, NY the school with the most national championships for Lacrosse they get crowds of 10,000 plus. Definitely a money maker for the school.

Podcast: Can the Trojans break their cold-streak in the State of Oregon?
In 2005, the Trojans left Eugene, Ore., satisfied after delivering a hearty 45-13 thumping to the Ducks.
Forging ahead · Redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler had 31 carries for 160 yards and a touchdown against Arizona last Saturday. The Trojans enter their game against Oregon State with a 7-3 record and a No. 20 ranking. - TIm Tran | Daily Trojan 
Since then, USC has found no joy playing in the state of Oregon, losing alternatively to Oregon State and the Ducks for four consecutive years.
The No. 20 Trojans look to finally snap that mysterious streak Saturday when they travel to Corvallis to face the Beavers. Kickoff is at 5 p.m.
The Beavers, who were ranked No. 24 in the AP at a few different points this season, suffered their fifth loss this season in embarrassing fashion last week at home against Washington State, which had not won a Pac-10 contest in 16 tries.
But the Beavers still have elusive running back Jacquizz Rodgers, who infamously ran for 186 yards and two touchdowns in the 2008 upset of the No. 1 Trojans. That game, of course, was played at Reser Stadium.
The 5-foot-7, 191-pound Rodgers is third in the Pac-10 with 99.2 yards per game behind Oregon’s LaMichael James and Cal’s Shane Vereen.
“He’s a lot like LaMichael James,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said.
The Trojans have been tackling at practice during the last three weeks, something USC coach Lane Kiffin was reluctant to do early in the season because of the risk of injury. Galippo said there has been a measurable improvement as a result of the change.
“Absolutely, especially in the games,” Galippo said. “It’s been incredible how low that missed tackle ratio has gotten in games ever since we started doing those drills.”
Improved defense and the continued stellar play of the offense have put the Trojans on an upward swing. They have won back-to-back games for the first time since opening the season 4-0.
But Kiffin said the Trojans must be wary of overconfidence, which seems to have seeped into the team’s practice mentality this week.
Kiffin said there was a “disappointing” lack of intensity in practice at the beginning of the week, something the Trojans could not afford heading into their final true road trip of the year.
“This is the time of year that this happens to some teams as you get close to finals and everything, and you’ve been going for a long time,” Kiffin said. “These guys have been out here for a lot of weeks in a row. It’s a challenge and one that we’re going to have to figure out before Saturday.”
To add injury to insult, freshman tailback Dillon Baxter was hospitalized Thursday for unspecified reasons.
Another thing the Trojans might have going against them is the weather. The forecast for Saturday calls for temperatures in the 30s and a 60 percent chance of rain in Corvallis. USC practiced with a wet ball this week to prepare for the potential inclement weather.
The Trojans should have the advantage up front, however, especially when the Beavers have the ball. The Oregon State offensive line gives up almost three sacks a game and starts mostly walk-ons or former walk-ons.
USC is seventh in the conference in sacks, but the defensive line has been hampered by injuries. Redshirt sophomore defensive ends Nick Perry (ankle) and Wes Horton (back) haven’t been at full strength all season.
Still, Saturday could present the right matchups for a breakout performance.
“I think the big issues for us are handling their defensive line,” said Oregon State coach Mike Riley. “Whatever we’re going to try to do, it’s going to be very important that we can block.”
The USC offensive line has hit its stride the last few games, opening up holes for redshirt junior tailback Marc Tyler. Though Tyler complained of soreness earlier in the week, he is on track to start against the Beavers. Tyler has rushed for 279 yards on 43 carries in his last two games.

Halloween was a few weeks ago, but that didn’t stop more than 100 people from congregating at the famous Hollywood Forever cemetery on Wednesday night.
People weren’t there to visit deceased loved ones or to scare themselves, but to experience a night of comedy at the monthly “Comedy is Dead” event.  Most would argue that there’s nothing funny about a cemetery, but the all-star crew — including Todd Barry, Chris Hardwick and Joe Rogan — did their best to prove that theory false.
This was the 13th installment of Comedy is Dead event, a fitting number for such a dark and eerie venue.
“This is the creepiest comedy venue ever,” said Matt Kirshen, a British comedian and former finalist on Last Comic Standing. Kirshen served as the night’s host, getting the crowd into the spirit of things before the sets began.
“At the end of the show we’re all going to run naked into the cemetery and start dancing around a tree,” he said.
Most of the other comedians felt similarly compelled to comment on the unusual venue for the show.
“Where there are thrones and a pentagram, there have been sacrificed babies,” Duncan Trussell said during his set.
The show, however, was not held in the grassy areas surrounding the graves, as some concerts at the cemetery are.
Instead, it took place on the second floor of the historic Masonic lodge.  Despite the pentagram dangling from the ceiling and abundance of candles lining the stage, the inside of the lodge is more Hollywood than cemetery, with classic movie posters decorating the walls.
“I never knew the Masons were such big Star Wars fans,” Kirshen said.
Last Comic Standing judge and regular Chelsea Lately contributor Natasha Leggero was the first comedian to perform.  She exhibited quality material about Snooki and Bristol Palin that would fit in on the celebrity-bashing Chelsea Lately Show, but much of her set consisted of imitating obnoxious accents that were entertaining at first, but ultimately grew annoying.
Following Leggero was Sean Rouse, an uninhibitedly vulgar and, at times, offensive comedian.  He sat in one of the lodge’s large, ornate chairs as he told off-kilter jokes about rape, abortion, race, religion and his own crippling rheumatoid arthritis.
“Rheumatoid arthritis means you’re so much of an asshole that your own immune system turns against you,” Rouse said. Despite the subject matter, the crowd laughed loudly to his offbeat comedy.
Self-proclaimed nerd Chris Hardwick followed Rouse.  When Hardwick wasn’t telling jokes about rednecks from his native Tennessee or nerdy gadgets and games, he discussed ghosts, a popular topic for the night.
He described testing out a failed ghost detecting device at that very cemetery, making the observation that ghosts are always described as more than a hundred years old, never as Sunset Strip-frequenting hair metal fans from the 1980s.
“Every channel has a ghost hunting show, except the news,” Hardwick said before going in to a rant about how the media would react if ghosts were actually real.
Comedian Duncan Trussell, perhaps best known for the “Drunk History” sketches on FunnyorDie.com, also had a few jokes about supernatural phenomena.
“I’m afraid that I’ll get an exorcism and I’ll come out,” he said.
Todd Barry was originally listed as the show’s headliner, but performed second to last.  His soft-spoken observational humor told in a deadpan monotone seemed to  with the crowd, some of which left immediately after his performance, thinking he was the show’s finale.
Those that left early definitely missed out on the best performance of the night.  Michael Ian Black, veteran of sketch comedy show The State and star of former Comedy Central shows Stella and Michael & Michael Have Issues, was slated to perform until he was replaced by UFC commentator and former Fear Factor host Joe Rogan.
Rogan had a much louder and more aggressive approach to his comedy compared to Barry, providing a refreshing burst of energy to the night.
“Gaze upon my douchebag attire,” Rogan said as he took the stage wearing a backwards cap and a leather jacket. “I’m 43 and still wearing a wallet chain.”
For those that don’t know Rogan outside of his stint on broadcast television’s Fear Factor, his jokes are usually profane and often include descriptions of his frequent drug experimentation.
“Marijuana and mushrooms are some of the most important things I’ve done in my life,” Rogan said before admitting that they occasionally make him come up with stupid observations, such as, “A unicorn is a donkey from the future.”
Rogan finished his headlining set with an extended joke comparing the boring and depressing nature of emotional songs such as “Hey There Delilah” with the ridiculous but enjoyable nature of hip-hop songs such as Ludacris’s “Saturday.”
As the show ended the crowd didn’t run into the cemetery naked and dance around the trees, but they did walk past the graves to their cars with smiles on their faces.

Creators of the local indie/punk music festival FYF Fest (along with Goldenvoice and L.A. Record) brought Portland trio The Thermals to the El Rey for a performance on Tuesday night.
FYF Fest is known for its assortment of loud, fast punk bands, calmer indie bands and then those that span the ambiguous border between the two loosely defined genres.
This year’s line up featured bands such as ’80s hardcore heroes 7Seconds and slower indie band Local Natives. The bands that played at the El Rey on Tuesday night would have no problem fitting on any FYF bill.
The show began with local quartet Lovely Bad Things, whose raw and fast yet poppy and polite style was definitely more lovely than bad. The quartet fit on the indie side of the spectrum, with their songs made up of in-tune vocal melodies and a mostly calm and reserved stage presence.
The next band, White Fang, represented the opposite end of the FYF spectrum.  Although their predecessors were polite and reserved, White Fang was flat out punk. The singer jumped, kicked, punched, cart wheeled, somersaulted, did jumping jacks and performed uninhibited dance moves to songs with titles such as “**** Up a Fascist (I’m Down),” “Portland Sucks” and “Grateful to Shred.”
When he wasn’t flailing around, the singer spent most of his time eccentrically facing sideways as if something interesting was happening on the side of the stage.  Things did get interesting in that area when someone backstage began good-naturedly throwing carrots and ice at the band, adding an extra touch of chaos to the already unruly performance.
The band’s energy did not slow down throughout their short, 25 minute set.  Mid-way through the set, the drummer ripped off a mask and wig he’d been wearing and threw it into the crowd.
The singer jumped on the shoulders of the guitarist from the first band (who was in the crowd watching), and sang the lyrics to his “song about drinking.”  The set ended with the singer tackling the guitarist to the ground and then frantically slapping the neck of the guitar and randomly twisting knobs on the connected pedals.
What White Fang lacked in complex musical and lyrical competence (sample lyric: Oh no it’s raining outside and I can’t skate / I guess I’ll stay inside and get real high), they made up with unabashed, entertaining energy.
Although Lovely Bad Things leaned towards the calmer indie side of the musical spectrum and White Fang leaned strongly toward the crazier punk side, The Thermals were the nearly perfect blend of both.  Their music was occasionally slow and at times poppy, but still inspired a mosh pit throughout much of the show.
The Thermals opened with “I Don’t Believe You,” the first single off of the recently released album Personal Life. Fellow Portland band White Fang’s energetic set was a tough act to follow, but the much larger, cheering crowd made it clear that the fans were there to see The Thermals, who are veterans of the Portland scene.
The band’s relative calmness was disappointing, especially because their songs are so high-energy and they are known for raucous live shows, but they made up for that with their classic songs and a strongly positive reaction from the crowd.
“I’m losing my voice.  But if you came to see anyone sing well, it wasn’t me,” said singer Hutch Harris from the stage in between songs.
It’s true that Harris might not be a classically trained or technical singer, but he does have a unique and intriguing voice.  In fact, his style of partly speaking, partly yelling is one of the band’s strongest assets.
That voice lasted throughout the band’s hour long set, which consisted of a mix of both new songs from Personal Life and older popular hits such as “Here’s Your Future,” “Now We Can See” and “We Were Sick.”
Kathy Foster’s loud, distorted bass and carefully controlled feedback complemented Harris’s singing, and drummer Westin Glass occasionally stood up to point at the crowd and sing along with them.  Older songs such as “No Culture Icons,” the band’s first single, sparked the strongest reactions from the crowd, but the fans seemed to enjoy the newer songs as well.
Members from the opening bands watched from the side of the stage throughout the entire show and, during the last song of the regular set, “Pillar,” jumped into the audience to dance with the crowd. Even if they’ve lost some of the energy that propelled them to fame, The Thermals still know how to put on a fun, entertaining live show
For the last song of the encore the band covered Weezer’s “My Name is Jonas,” providing an unexpected and entertaining end to the night that undoubtedly pleased fans both young and old.
I was at that show and I am a bit confused about the “calm and reserved” quote about the first band The Lovely Bad Things. They never stopped moving and I found them full of energy and a great start to the show. I went to see the Thermals, but I will definately go see this band again.

USC students from various academic departments will participate in TEDxTrousdale, an event that aims to explore ideas about social and environmental change, Saturday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
TEDxTrousdale is an independently organized event that was inspired by the nonprofit organization TED, whose motto is “ideas worth spreading.”
TED hosts annual conferences that bring together innovative thinkers from around the world to convey their new ideas regarding technology, business, science and more. Past speakers have included movie producer J.J. Abrams, Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Nobel laureate James Watson.
The event at USC aims to reach out to both undergraduate and graduate students as student speakers will encourage their peers to think about how they can contribute to this change and make an impact on their world.
Rachel Tobias, co-organizer of TEDxTrousdale and a senior majoring in international relations, said the purpose of the event is to profile students and give them a chance to showcase their passions.
“The theme of the event is ‘Make Your Mark,’ and we really want to show students that you can be a 20-something and still make a difference,” Tobias said. “You don’t need a Ph.D. or a career to make a positive impact on the world as a young person.”
Tobias said she first began thinking about creating a TED event at USC after interning for the organization over the summer.
“I was personally inspired by the work I saw at TED, so in early September I started going to different departments around USC to see if they wanted to sponsor us,” she said.
The event is sponsored by the USC Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics, the USC Marshall School of Business and Business Lab, the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, and the USC Stevens Institute for Innovation.
This is the first year of TEDxTrousdale, but Tobias and co-organizer Megan McAninch hope that it continues in the future.
“We’re both seniors, so we hope that we can pass the torch to the sophomores and juniors that are participating in this event in the years to come,” said McAninch, who is a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies.
Sarah Barrett, a junior majoring in business administration, plans to speak at the event about how students can positively effect change through business.
“It’s an honor to present with such amazing leaders in our own generation here at USC,” Barrett said. “I really believe that this is a great collaboration of students with a variety of different interests to share our experiences with each other and broaden our sense of learning.”
Tobias said she hopes those who plan on attending TEDxTrousdale will gain a new perspective on how they can make a difference at USC and on a larger, community scale.
“We want to really challenge students to open their minds to new ideas,” she said. “Students can have these assumptions and stuck perceptions, and we want them to re-evaluate those and incorporate these new ideas into whatever they want to do in the world.”

Moreton Fig, the upscale restaurant in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, has extended its hours to include dinner and happy hour Monday through Friday.
After its grand opening in August, Moreton Fig was only open for lunch, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The restaurant has expanded its hours, however, and is now open from 4 p.m. to 7 pm. for happy hour and 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. for dinner.
“To have Moreton Fig available for lunch, dinner and happy hour — that’s what we had always planned. Since, we opened nine restaurants at the same time, though, we thought it more beneficial [for Moreton Fig] to be open for lunch first,” said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality.
Adding dinner hours meant adding a dinner menu, which offers similar items to what is served at lunch — with a few specialities just for the later meal.
These new hours has also opened the restaurant up to a broader audience, Klinger said, attracting more student customers who might be available for dinner instead of lunch.
“I see a lot of grad students coming in around happy hour,” said Blake Shaw, a junior majoring in business administration and a waiter at Moreton Fig.
Although Moreton Fig aims to service everyone on campus, Klinger said, the majority of its customers are professors and administrators, as most students are not willing to pay for a more expensive meal. Klinger admits that most people will likely not eat there everyday, but said he expects customers will frequent the eatery once a week or once a month.
“College students are known to be on a budget; I can’t afford to spend so much money on one meal,” said Thalia Ertman, a freshman majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.
Some students disagreed, however, saying there are reasonably priced items on the menu and that the price reflects the quality of the food and the quality of the experience.
“I often come [to Moreton Fig] for lunch; it’s usually a lot faster than going to the rest of the campus center, and it can also be cheaper for the quality of food you get,” said Madison Orgill, a sophomore majoring in fine arts and a waitress at Moreton Fig.
Moreton Fig is meant to be the nicest out of the nine dining options in the campus center, she said, so its atmosphere helps perpetuate the fine dining experience.
“Moreton Fig is classy,” Orgill said. “It’s a great place to bring a date because it’s not too formal, but it’s nicer than some other places on campus.”
Moreton Fig has tried to bring local and sustainable food choices into its kitchen, stating on its menu that the restaurant uses and supports “organic, small family farms whenever possible.”
“We’re trying to be reasonable and approachable; we’re trying to match our food philosophy with the setting of the restaurant,” Klinger said. “Both the quality of food and the quality of service speak for themselves.”

USC professor Michael Quick has been appointed to the position of executive vice provost, the second ranking administrator in the Office of the Provost.
Quick will work closely with Elizabeth Garrett, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, and will be responsible for advancing the undergraduate curriculum and enhancing the undergraduate experience.
Quick step · Michael Quick, the new executive vice provost, was the executive vice dean of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
The position of executive vice provost was previously held by Jean Morrison, who left USC to become provost at Boston University. Morrison had been on the faculty since 1988.
“To me, Michael represents the very best of USC’s faculty,” Garrett said. “He is a gifted academic administrator who has a vision that can move the university further toward its goals of academic excellence.”
As executive vice provost, Quick will play a key role in the university’s strategic planning process and will represent the provost in the academic program review process, Garrett said. He will also represent the provost on many committees regarding academic policies and procedures, the hiring of faculty, athletic-academic affairs, and curriculum.
Quick said he is excited about his new position and will still be able to continue many projects that he has been working on, but on a larger scale.
“In a way, a lot of the things I’m going to be doing are similar to what I’m doing in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences,” Quick said. “Instead of solely working in the College, it’s going to be exciting working with a variety of schools and academic disciplines such as the theater, medical and public policy schools.”
Quick began working at USC as an associate professor of biological sciences in 2002.
He was then appointed as the vice dean for research in the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and most recently worked as the executive vice dean of the college. He has also served as director of the Neuroscience Graduate Program.
When looking back on his career at USC, Quick said he is amazed at all he has accomplished.
“When I first started here, I had no idea I would come this far. I just wanted to teach undergraduates, which is really something that I really enjoy doing,” Quick said.
Quick will also be responsible for managing the progress of the Ph.D programs along with overseeing the Postdoctoral Fellowship Scholars program. He will oversee the Office of Undergraduate Programs, led by vice provost Gene Bickers, and the USC Graduate School, led by Vice Provost Sally Pratt, and the Office of Continuing Education and Summer Programs led by Associate Provost Eileen Kohan.
Quick said he is thrilled to begin his new position.
“I’m excited to help move USC forward,” Quick said. “I think I have one of the best jobs in the university.”

As part of USC’s Healthy Trojans wellness initiative, the University Park Campus is beginning to make steps toward becoming smoke-free.
The USC Academic Senate — composed of faculty members — began considering a smoke-free campus last December, when it started to conduct research on the feasibility and the possible benefits.
Though this idea is only in its conceptual stages, members of the Academic Senate are pushing for a smoke-free campus to become a reality — as soon as within a few years.
Chris Chomyn, a member of the senate and co-chair for the provost’s advisement on family rights, said he heard many arguments from USC community members in favor of going smoke-free.
“One of the most compelling reasons that I heard was from Dr. Joseph Randolph,” Chomyn said. “He basically let us know that smoking causes tumors in nine different organs of humans. Additionally secondhand smoke causes cancer in people, and tobacco can be linked to more than 30 percent of all human cancers.”
When research and statistics were presented to the Academic Senate in April, an initiative was almost unanimously passed to turn USC in the direction of a smoke-free campus. Since then, the USC Staff Assembly has also proposed and passed a similar initiative after talking with the Academic Senate.
As the smoke-free initiative becomes more of a realistic possibility for USC, the Academic Senate has begun to think of the logistics involved in making USC smoke-free, said Patty Riley, co-chair of the faculty environmental committee of the Academic Senate.
“It might follow the process that other organizations have used, which is a phased process where they first designate smoking areas for some amount of time,” Riley said. “Then, eventually the campus or the hospital or whatever sort of organization it is goes completely smoke-free.”
Currently, there are a few designated smoking areas on campus, near the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and the Pertusati Bookstore.
Though there is no campus ban on smoking, there are restrictions already in place, including a ban on smoking in or within 20 feet of university buildings.
Administrators are not sure when the initiative will become a reality, said Peter Conti, head of the Academic Senate, but they do agree on one thing: USC’s transition to a smoke-free campus will attempt to be understanding of the students’ experience.
“The most important thing here is that it’s not going to be a punitive process; it’s going to be an educational process,” Conti said. “I think we want to make it more of a joint effort between communities, saying, ‘We can do this as a community.’”
Though the faculty and staff are in favor of the smoke-free initiative, it must next be approved by student groups in order to move forward.
The Faculty Environmental Committee, along with the Advisory Committee on Work and Family Life, plan to speak to both the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate and Professional Student Senate this year to learn if students are in favor of the initiative.
Alex Williams, a freshman majoring in theatre who does not smoke, said she is in favor of a smoke-free campus.
“I just find it inconvenient to have to walk around and smell cigarette smoke everywhere outside because people don’t follow the rules necessarily of being far away from buildings or staying in the designated smoking areas,” Williams said. “I personally think [a smoke-free campus] is fine because my own personal view is that smoking kills and it is hazardous to people’s health, long-term and short-term.”
Williams said student input should be a large part of the process, and suggested public forums or school-wide surveys to gauge student opinions.
Other students said they felt differently.
William Hellwarth, a freshman majoring in interactive entertainment who smokes, acknowledged that smoking is unhealthy, but said he believes it is a choice.
“A lot of kids value very strongly their rights, including stuff like smoking on campus,” Hellwarth said. “They would feel trodden on, certainly.”
Conti said although students do have the right to make their own decisions, others also have the right to be healthy.
“People around you have a right to be healthy too. And we want to encourage people to choose that right as opposed to choosing the right to smoke,” he said.
The university already has programs to help students stop smoking with the aid of counseling services, patches and even prescriptions. As the initiative progresses, the emphasis will be on helping students to make healthy decisions.
“It’s important that the students get involved,” Conti said. “If the students want this to happen, it will happen.”
To be smoke-free, I think it will also mean that their will be designated areas where smoking could take place. At least that is what places that have banned smoking seems to have done. A healthy environment is important.
this is kind of foolish. instead of banning smoking entirely, why not just actually enforce the 20-foot rule once in a while?

Fans of graphic novels have read every plot imaginable. Radioactive mishaps are a yawn. Apocalypse is old hat. It’s time for some space gladiators.
The Reconcilers is a new graphic novel series published by Viking Warrior Press and created by the superstar team of Erik Jensen, R. Emery Bright and Jens Pil Pilegaard.
Bloodsport · In The Reconcilers, war has been replaced by gladiator-style combat, which decides diplomatic issues and also placates the masses from challenging those in power. - Design by Renee Cohn, photos courtesy of Prodigy PR 
In addition to award-winning writer Jensen and two-time Eisner nominee artist Shepherd Hendrix, the legendary artist Neal Adams (of Batman and Green Lantern fame) contributes to the graphic novel by providing the cover art, additional character design and crucial consultation.
Taking place in the year 2165 A.D., the first issue follows the workers of a small mining outfit (Hansen Lunar Engineering) as they defend their claim to a large “Liberty Ore” deposit found deep beneath the Moon’s surface.
After the great Corporations Wars, the ruthless CEO Maximillian Sokor comes out as victorious and institutes a formalized Gladiator-style process, known as Reconciliation, to settle disputes — imagine Ender’s Game meets Gladiator meets Battle Royale.
Insulted by Sokor’s measly offer of 10 percent of the Liberty Ore’s net worth and upset by the death of her father Alex Hansen, the female protagonist, challenges Sokor’s proxies to full Reconciliation.
It is the classic underdog story of a ragtag group of working-class heroes matched up against the better-equipped and much more powerful Sokor Reconcilers. The Hansen team, however, does have one secret weapon: Sean Hexhammer, a widower and father turned unstoppable warrior.
In a world where corporations are the dominant political and economic force, people are no longer proud and patriotic members of their country, but rather die-hard fans of their favorite company.
The fight-to-the-death Reconciliation is televised for the world, functioning as an opiate for the masses and a means for maintaining power over society. Despite Reconciliation eliminating the need for war, Earth has already been reduced to wreckage from the Corporation Wars and people have lost all faith in their government and themselves.
Bright pointed out the double meaning of the graphic novel’s title.
“All of these characters have something to reconcile within themselves,” he said. “So the title and the process of reconciliation does not necessarily stop within the arena; it goes on internally as well.”
Jensen had his own thoughts on the topic of this kind of internal, moral reconciliation.
“How do we reconcile our massive consumption of energy with the lives that it costs to excavate it?” he asked.
Almost four years into development, the series is a labor of love from the creators. After the years of hard work, the first issue of The Reconcilers is now available for purchase online. It hits bookstores Dec. 8, with the second issue following in February.
In the backdrop of the book’s action, the roles of capitalism, corporatism and brand loyalty play major roles, permeating every aspect of the series.
Bright, affected by the presence of real-life corporate shadow forces during the Liberian coup d’état in the 1980s, became interested in exposing the impact that mega-corporations can have on the disenfranchised, especially in places that are rich in resources.
With The Reconcilers, Bright said that he wishes to show readers a world “where corporation can no longer be content with being shadow forces and start to open the operative sovereign entities, and we are starting to see that.”
Although it might sound dystopian, Jensen was quick to point out real-world versions of the science-fiction story.
“They have all the rights of an individual but none of the responsibility,” he said, something that he points out is supported by a January Supreme Court decision.
According to the decision, corporations can contribute money to elections, potentially allowing them unprecedented influence on candidate’s positions. With huge corporations allowed to financially participate in our electoral process, it seems a real possibility that this merging of business and politics could produce a reality where corporations control the world.
Jensen said he views comic books as an underused medium for telling the kind of stories he wants to share.
“We live in a culture with lots of dirty little secrets. Comic books are perfect for telling these stories,” Jensen said.
The creators’ focus, however, is not their politics. Rather, using their experience in film and television on shows such as The Wire and Law & Order, they concentrated on the development of their characters.
Each character stands out and becomes easily distinguishable to the reader, all the more important in a series with a large cast such as this one.
Jenson reiterated the writing team’s dedication to character development.
“As actors, we are always asking what is the character doing and why is he doing it,” he said. “A lot of our sessions are based solely on character … so they aren’t just two-dimensional blobs of color — they actually have some life in them.”
The writers and artists have an obvious passion for their project and it translates onto the comic page, creating colorful panels filled with clever dialogue.
Their intention to adapt and evolve with the times adds extra incentive to follow this series to the end.

Earlier this week I was talking to a non-cinephile friend of mine who expressed an interest in delving into the beautiful and emotionally charged world of French film. A chance to share some of the best, under-appreciated cinema with someone excited me.
I recommended a few directors she should check out if she had a genuine interest (Godard, Renoir, Clouzout) — one of which was Michael Haneke.
Now, I understand that Haneke is Austrian, but I’m including his work here as his style is evocative of the best of French cinema.
This conversation led me to rewatch the movie Hidden again, which is — excepting perhaps The White Ribbon — my favorite Haneke film.
Hidden is a thriller about a bourgeois couple (Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) placed under surveillance by a stranger. Tapes of the couple’s front door mysteriously begin to appear, accompanied by violent drawings. Though neither the tapes nor the drawings seem to have any motivation, they begin to drive a wedge between the happy couple.
Hidden is a wonderful and disconcerting film that explores the nature of guilt and how a simple watchful gaze can bring it frothing to the surface. Haneke’s direction is brilliant, keeping the film’s tension pitched and taut throughout. In short — as you can probably tell — I like it.
As I was watching Hidden, I was struck by the silence and stillness of the film. This is a common Haneke motif, so “struck” is probably an ill-considered use of the predicate nominative, but nonetheless it resonated with me in a different way than it had on previous occasions.
Hidden was the third Haneke film that I watched, the previous two being The Piano Teacher and The White Ribbon, and in each I had appreciated his restraint — a restraint that seemed to place the characters and the story on a higher plane, allowing the audience to engage with the film on a conscious, intellectual level rather than on a subconscious, emotional one.
I used to think Haneke’s silence was merely a formal strategy designed to enhance the effect, a byproduct of his realist tendencies. It was something integrated into the story for dramatic and psychological effect, not a driving force of the story itself.
I now believe that I was wrong, or rather, intellectually lazy and negligent. Haneke’s sound design is not merely a post-script to the story; rather, it is a portal into his mind and the fountainhead from which the stories are sprung.
This came from watching Hidden on the first day of spring vacation, a day which, for most college students, full of hustle, bustle, travel and, most of all, noise.
Noise: We soak it up and let it rattle around in our minds, obfuscating our thoughts. Our ears take it all in, all the sounds of the city, all the rambling, unorganized notes that make up the songs of our lives. And we can’t take it. Our minds can’t make sense of it, so we retreat into ourselves, into our own thoughts and own perspectives. It isolates us.
What films like Hidden do is explore that isolation. Instead of bringing characters into their surrounding world, the films push the characters into themselves.
This is what lies at the base of Haneke’s work. He’s not trying to get us to look at life through a different person’s perspective. He’s not trying to get us to walk a mile in another person’s shoes. He’s trying to get us to view ourselves as we are, to see ourselves in our own environment.
Look at how the presence of a simple, stationary camera unravels the lives of a self-satisfied intellectual couple. Might the same be true of us? Are the bonds that hold our lives together likewise tenuous?
When our lives are reduced to fundamentals, when the noise that fills our lives is stripped away, what are we left with? Who are we as human beings?
Now that’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it?

How often do people get to eat sweets for a cause? Not often enough. Cupcake Camp L.A., an annual cupcake bake-fest with proceeds going to local charities, is changing that.
The idea of Cupcake Camp is simple: a place for like-minded foodies to hang out and taste cupcakes created by professional and amateur bakers alike, all while helping a good cause.
Cupcake Camp L.A. is organized and produced by Babette Pepaj, the creator of the food-centric social networking site BakeSpace, an online grassroots community for people who enjoy baking and cooking.
“I volunteered to start Cupcake Camp in Los Angeles because I felt I had to get involved,” Pepaj said.
Cupcake Camp was originally started in San Francisco by Ariel Waldman, who called it an “ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and eat cupcakes in an open environment.”
“Cupcake Camp began as a grassroots community type of cupcake party,” Pepaj said.
The concept has since been adopted in cities and communities across the country, from Ottawa, Canada to Orange County, Toronto to Tallahassee, Fla.
It quickly evolved into a philanthropic event. The producers of the event in each city choose a charity, or multiple charities, to benefit from the profits from ticket and tasting sales.
The Los Angeles event benefits three different charities: Angel Acres Horse Haven Rescue, American Tortoise Rescue and InvisiblePeople.tv. Angel Acres Horse Haven Rescue, founded in 2004 by Jo Deibel, is a non-profit organization that saves horses from being slaughtered or abandoned.
With American Tortoise Rescue located in Malibu, Calif., Marshall Thompson and Susan Tellem work to ensure that turtles from other countries are not imported illegally into the United States, where they not only have a difficult time adapting to a new environment but can also be detrimental to the ecosystem of the Pacific Ocean.
Invisible People was started by Mark Horvath, a former TV producer who once found himself homeless after a battle with drug addiction.
With InvisiblePeople.tv, he not only works to tell the unheard story of homeless people in Los Angeles but also uses social media networks to help them re-enter the job market.
Other than the charities, no one involved in the event profits from it in any way.
The bakers involved volunteered their time to help out.
Pepaj said she felt that after “claiming” the city of Los Angeles as her home, she has a responsibility to fill. Cupcake Camp has a large following wherever it goes, and Pepaj is expecting about 2,000 attendees at Cupcake Camp L.A. this Saturday at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood, Calif.
With all the work involved, Pepaj equated producing and hosting the Cupcake Camp event to hosting a birthday party.
“What better kind of birthday party to throw than one where you can give back?” she said.
But Pepaj isn’t doing this alone. She has been contacted by dozens of people willing to volunteer their time.
“It’s easy to produce an event like this when people want to participate,” she said.
The bakers range from amateur to professional. They not only donate cupcakes (some will be bringing as many as 600), but also their time.
With more than 30 bakers scheduled to offer cupcakes for tasting, everything from vegan cupcakes to gluten-free, sugar-free and organic cupcakes will be available.
Some of the bakers will be featuring classics such as red velvet, while others will be debuting new flavors or holiday-themed cupcakes, such as Nutella cupcakes and pumpkin brown butter cupcakes.
“If the cupcakes are for a good cause, the calories don’t count,” she said.

The USC audition round is on Monday, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., at the Hollywood Comedy Club. Each comedian will perform three-minute sets in hopes of moving on to the next round, in which the top-10 auditions from both schools will be posted online. The five Trojans and Bruins with the most votes are promoted to the semifinals in January.
USC students are encouraged to come out to the Laugh Factory on Monday. In addition to seeing some talented Trojans, USC students who make it to The Laugh Factory Monday will watch stand-up sets from professional emcees and a special comedian guest.
Laugh Bowl creator and Laugh Factory executive producer Daron Moore said she originally thought of the show as a way to increase student interest in comedy.
“What better way to get students interested, as well as search for new talent, than to create a college comedy competition and utilize the great rivalry to get the students passionate?” Moore said.
But the school rivalry and the local talent turned it into something else. Instead of a promotional event, it became a matter of collegiate pride. The first show surprised Moore, who said she was impressed by the variety of student turnout.
“There were a few students from last year that had never performed stand-up before and those who were experienced comedians and/or actors. We had a wide range of students who tried out, from athletes to frat boys to theatre and acting majors,” she said.
One of the more experienced comedians was Laugh Bowl winner Devin Field, a junior majoring in screenwriting and member of USC’s Second Nature improv group.
Field began doing stand-up at age 15 at open-mic nights at his high school, where he was one of the few comedians.
“It was mostly bad poets and singer-songwriters. You’d sit through so many unrequited love poems, [the audience] was so tired of feeling sad they would literally laugh at anything,” he said.
But the Laugh Bowl offered a tougher crowd, and though Field has been performing stand-up in small clubs for years, he found the competition to be a learning experience.
“You have to constantly be honing a good seven to 10 minutes of material, which is really valuable to have as a stand-up comedian,” he said.
Field was also able to make industry connections through his participation in the Laugh Bowl.
Although it wasn’t part of his official prize, Field met with an MTV representative who attended the finals and has since run into him at shows around the city; eventually the representative offered Field an internship at the network.
Similarly, Field was given the chance to be a part of the Laugh Factory’s Fresh Faces lineup after the competition ended.
“That was the coolest part. I got to perform with a bunch of really great underground comedians who are just starting to get on TV,” he said.
When MTV contacted Moore about attending the final round of last year’s competition, she couldn’t have been happier.
“I was delighted that the student comedians who had worked very hard to make the auditions were going to get the exposure they deserved,” she said. “It was a great feeling to see that the event was getting so much attention.”
This year, the Laugh Bowl hopes to be even better positioned to give college comedians a start in the industry, with MTV talent and casting representatives attending every round of the competition.
The winner of the Laugh Bowl will receive a meeting with MTV and a spot in the MTV Comedy Showcase, an event attended by industry people looking for new talent for upcoming projects.
In addition to networking opportunities and industry exposure, participants gain valuable performance experience and educational guidance.
“Student who make it past the semifinal round will get the chance to attend every open mic at the Laugh Factory in Hollywood and receive one-on-one training from [Laugh Factory founder] Jamie Masada.
Getting up to perform in front of seasoned professionals and industry scouts can be daunting for some college comedians, but being among fellow students during the competition helped. Field was joined by other members of Second Nature, which helped ease his nerves.
“I could just go out there with my friends. I wouldn’t have done it otherwise,” he said.
But the Laugh Bowl is also a friendly competition between crosstown rivals. In a recent Daily Bruin article, a UCLA competitor from last year argued that, despite Field’s win, the Bruin comedians were funnier than Trojans throughout the entire night. But Field would beg to differ.
“Look at the results. USC came out on top,” he said. “You wouldn’t say that the Texas Rangers were better than the Giants. Because they weren’t. They lost.”
Moore notes that she was very impressed by the turnout at UCLA’s audition round, which took place last Friday. Given the performance, Trojans might need to watch out.
“The level of talent has risen considerably from last year,” she said. “USC needs to bring their A-game.”

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 [rated PG-13]
The film’s trailers call it “the motion picture event of our generation.” Today, audiences can experience part one of this two-part cinematic event and begin to say their farewells to Harry Potter. After entertaining adults and children alike over the last decade, the Harry Potter film series has reached its epic conclusion in The Deathly Hallows, the first half premiering this weekend with the second part of the story coming out next year. In this installment Harry, Ron and Hermione must not only destroy the Horcruxes, but stop the increasing power of Voldemort and his wicked army.
The Next Three Days [rated PG-13]
Russell Crowe plays a man hell-bent on finding the truth after his wife is convicted of murder in Paul Haggis’ latest thriller. The writer and director of Crash seems to have switched his attention from racism and classism to elaborate chase sequences and fiery action in the remake of the 2008 French film, Pour Elle. Along with Crowe, the film features performances from Elizabeth Banks, RZA and Liam Neeson.
Made in Dagenham [rated R]
If big Hollywood movies such as Harry Potter and The Next Three Days aren’t your cup of tea, then try out this rousing English film about female empowerment. The movie depicts a series of events in 1968 that occur when a group of female workers at a Ford car plant protest unequal pay and sexual harassment in the workplace and walk out on their bosses.

As the spring semester nears and USC seniors prepare for graduation, the lagging economy has led many job-seeking students to modify their post-grad plans. Some have dodged the career hunt entirely, favoring graduate school as an option to duck out of the real world until the market improves.
During times of economic instability, many students who have recently earned a valuable bachelor’s degree will dive back into academia for a master’s degree and safe haven.
Students who advocate for this investment in education have a valid argument; those discouraged by sparse employment prospects might build their skills and then re-enter the job market when the economy strengthens. Seniors must not be too hasty to rely on further education as the solution, however, because not all career paths will benefit from an additional degree.
Rather than return to college and become prisoners to additional student loans, it might be more prudent for students to recast their career expectations and continue applying for jobs. By widening their pool of prospects to include various industries and types of positions, students can bolster their ability to secure a job.
“It started off as desperation,” said Nikki Ryu, a senior majoring in business administration, of her decision to apply for positions in finance, management and education. “But it has turned into an opportunity to open different doors that I didn’t know were there.”
Ryu said she submitted a résumé to every listing for which she was qualified on USC’s On Campus Recruiting website. She has already received one job offer, and continues to interview for others as she awaits the outcome of her application to Teach For America, a non-profit that recruits recent college graduates to teach in various low-income communities as part of a two-year program.
This method of starting one’s career in a role a student might not have considered originally is becoming more common. Students might apply a bachelor’s degree in engineering to operations management, or a background in journalism to an advertising agency. Blair Jason, a senior majoring in international business and Chinese, had an internship experience based in entertainment, yet said she found it valuable to restrategize during the job hunt.
“Entertainment doesn’t pay well and their focus is not the same as mine. Then I applied for consulting jobs but they want students with an IT background,” said Jason, who recently accepted an offer to join British Petroleum’s rotational program. “I just became open to anything where I could pursue and develop a career. And BP was the choice.”
Students might consider alternative career paths not only to secure a first job, but also to determine the effectiveness of different degrees. Students working first jobs in an industry with which they are relatively unfamiliar have the opportunity to observe which graduate degrees prove most successful for earning increased pay or as a link to an ideal career.
Although some master’s degrees are required for professions, such as medicine and law, most professionals must use their discretion in deciding whether a second or third degree will make a significant impact on their desired career path.
Some factors to consider when choosing a graduate program include whether alumni have earned increased pay or opportunities for upward mobility. Ultimately though, students must decide whether the cost of an additional degree will result in equal or greater value added to their careers and long-term goals.
“I think it’ll be a matter of whether it makes sense in the career path I choose to follow,” said Ryu, when asked about her post-USC options after returning home from a final-round interview with a San Francisco bank. “I hope to go to grad school at some point — it’ll just be a matter of the opportunity and the time.”
For now, Ryu said she will consider employment in a diverse range of industries. She said that although pursuing multiple paths made her nervous, “casting the net really wide has helped me learn about myself, and help me learn about other opportunities that I wouldn’t have known otherwise.”
Scouring for jobs amid the recession requires boldness and persistence. And whether students continue the quest or apply to graduate school instead, all can benefit from a broadened view of how to apply their educations.
“My vision of what I can do with a theatre degree has really expanded,” said Shaheed Sabrin, a senior majoring in theatre and minoring in entrepreneurship. “My preferences would be directing and acting, but through the career fair, I came to realize that there are other opportunities for me even if they are not labeled as acting. I can be a spokesperson, or a sports journalist. So I’m not limiting myself.”
Kelsey Clark is a senior majoring in print and digital journalism.
This bad economy has deemed some…no, many majors, null. When you become disillusioned to realize that your once pragmatic degree is now a pseudo-science, because some degrees shouldn’t have “science” as titular in B.S., you realize that you should’ve killed yourself to get into med-school. 
I work at firm in which majority of the people come from prestigious schools, namely the UCs and especially our crosstown rival. But what I notice is that all my coworkers have degrees such as “management science,” euphemism for economics, political science, pyschology and the likes. No wonder we’re all in the same boat–futile degrees–from

One evening, I was reviewing for exams with five or six other students. Things had gone smoothly; we had rattled off key terms like model students, and not one of us had defected to Facebook (shocking, but true). During break, one person posed a question that stumped the entire room:
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
“What do you want to do after graduation?”
Instantly, our faces went from “I’m in control” to “I’m scared and possibly in kindergarten.”  
I’ve witnessed this reaction countless times. Actually, I’ve given it. It seems like nothing scares a college student more than the idea of not being a college student.
This fear has an understandable basis. It’s hard to know if you’ll like a so-called dream job after a few short internships in the field; plus, if there really are endless possibilities, some of them are bound to be terrible.
Of course, the job question is not one we can avoid if we plan on being financially independent. With this in mind, I’ve wondered why it’s still so difficult to answer.
I haven’t found “the” answer, but I think I’ve found one of them. People usually approach the question by thinking of jobs that exist and trying to pick one of them. This approach works for people who see a career as a means to a comfortable life — but if you happen to want more, it can be pretty unfulfilling.
I’m neither a career counselor nor a fortune teller. There’s no magical equation for career-related happiness. Still, I think there’s a different way to look at things.
Step one: Ask yourself what you love to do for hours on end. Step two: Find a way to get paid for it. Step three: See if you can stand the working conditions. If you can’t, find the next best thing.
This approach avoids determining a grand goal and coming up with obstacles to fight on the way. I know that when I think like that, I come up with massive, video game-worthy obstacles and end up imagining myself homeless. I prefer the path of least resistance.
I’ll give an example from someone I worked with last summer. He went to Stanford for studio arts — weird, yes, but commendable. Along the way, he found a passion for food and went to culinary school. He worked in catering before one thing led to another, and now? He’s doing marketing for a small tech company.
At first, I could not fathom the switch, but he explained that his current job involves both drawing and event planning. In other words, it combines many of the things he liked in ways he hadn’t expected.
I’m sure his path was uncertain, but for anyone who dreams of finding a job that really fits, that journey should be encouraging. The economy might have tanked, but that means jobs in general are limited, not that all nontraditional jobs have gone away.
If you’re willing to take some risks, you can try to fashion your own job. The Internet helps — big time.
Perez Hilton, the Hemingway of the blogosphere, actually started out as an actor (and failed). He then freelanced, blogging on the side “because it seemed easy.” Well, blogging is now his job. He now says he finds the trappings of fame exhausting, but you can’t deny the appeal in getting paid to do something you would have ended up doing anyway.
The Internet option isn’t limited to people who like being snarky. Like vintage clothes? Some people make a living off eBay. Spend all your time stalking celebrities on Twitter? Many companies now pay people to tweet.
These are starting points, but if they pay the bills, you don’t always have to think of where they’ll lead — you can trust yourself to get there when you get there.
I realize that this path-of-least-resistance stuff might lead to a rather jumbled résumé. However, many people with a lot of experience are saying that the days of having one career are gone.  
In One Person/Multiple Careers: A New Model for Work/Life Success, Marci Alboher explains the slash concept. She is a writer/teacher/public speaker and according to her, leaving the stable job sphere used to be “like burning a bridge.” Now it’s becoming much more socially acceptable to blur the lines — especially, she said, among young people.
I’d be surprised if you haven’t heard a professor say something similar. The point is, having experience in both sales and massage therapy doesn’t make you unfocused anymore. In fact, it can make you more multi-dimensional. You might not be as experienced as some of the other job candidates, but at least you can count on standing out.
If someone asks you what you’re going to do after graduation and you have the urge to panic, resist. Stop thinking about 20 years from now. What about next year?
Here’s my answer: I’m going to find the best possible degree/party. 
Maya Itah is a junior majoring in communication and international relations. Her column, “Wait, Think Again,” runs every other Friday.
Dear Maya,
Least resistance pate has it’s own shortcoming as you should know. There is a say that one learn only from failures, You do not get it from successes usualy.
We really enjoy your writing, keep it up!

Freshman year of college is a very memorable time in most people’s lives. It is a time when young people decide what kind of adults they want to be in whole new surroundings around brand-new people.
TBS’ upcoming comedy series, Glory Daze, tries to revive that atmosphere, only for those who went to college in the ’80s. The show follows the lives of four college freshmen at the fictional Hayes University and their experience pledging a fraternity.
The pilot episode follows the students as they move into their dorms and embark on what they hope will be the four most memorable years of their lives.
Within the first episode viewers can recognize experiences that most college students can relate to — awkward roommates, insane professors and an overwhelming amount of temptation.
In each character featured in the pilot episode, you will probably see a little bit of someone you have met in college.
The pilot episode allows viewers to take in the different personalities of the show’s lead actors. Joel, (Kelly Blatz, Aaron Stone) is the show’s main character and soon finds himself falling for his dream girl on his first day of class. Because of his fear of having a boring social life and in pursuit his dream girl, he decides to join a fraternity.
Eli, (Matt Bush, Adventureland) is a virgin desperately hoping to change his image in college.
Jason (Drew Seeley, Campus Confidential) is a stone-cold conservative coming to college with his high school sweetheart; both hope to join the most prestigious fraternity and sorority at the university, respectively. But as soon as the couple gets to campus, they realize that they both want different things out of college.
Rounding out the cast is Brian (Hartley Sawyer, Killian), who plays baseball for the university but is desperate to fill his father’s shoes in the sport.
Together, the guys decide to rush fraternity houses, but they struggle to find one they like. As they continue to tour fraternities, they are drawn to the Omega Sigma fraternity and their insane partying.
Eli is introduced to the Oracle, a “super-senior” stoner, who lives in the basement of the fraternity. The Oracle tells Eli all about Steve Byerson, a man the fraternity recognizes as a legend; and in his inebriated state, Eli takes it upon himself to get Byerson the recognition he deserves from the university.
After one crazy night of partying at the house and eventually being arrested for their actions following the party, the guys receive bids to pledge the fraternity. Soon after, they see how quickly — and how painfully — things turn from the fun of rush parties to the challenge of pledging a fraternity.
Unfortunately, the show’s ’80s setting — its main gimmick — does not add much to the pilot except for a few Ronald Reagan references. Although the students do dress differently than what you would see in a lecture hall at USC today, that is about as far as the 80s setting goes in the pilot.
Hopefully the era’s influence will be featured more prominently throughout the season.
Because of the show’s college theme, it does have the problem that its content does not delve into any unchartered territories. The pilot never really strays far from the stereotypes, especially when it comes to fraternity life.
The entire pilot episode gives the viewer a sense that we’ve seen this all before. The writing struggles to escape from cliché, mostly because college life has been done too many times in television and film to really make things both funny and unique. The show’s pilot episode will certainly remind many viewers of films such as Animal House and television series such as Undeclared.
The series is lead by a very young cast with a few familiar faces scattered around. The most familiar face is probably that of Tim Meadows (plays professor Haines), who you will probably recognize from his roles in Mean Girls and Saturday Night Live.
Although it is easy to see the potential in the show’s leads, it is still obvious that many of the actors lack experience in comedic delivery. Some of the jokes come off stale and many of the serious scenes come off unconvincing. Also, many of the show’s comedic attempts were so over the top that they lost their humor.
Despite the flat jokes, the pilot still had enough laugh-out-loud moments to bring hope for what the rest of the season has to offer.
Glory Daze premiered on TBS on Nov. 16.

With the food-centric holiday season fully underway, the only topic more salient than how to make our favorite seasonal foods is how to avoid our favorite seasonal foods.
Although the horror stories of an exclusively elastic-waistband wardrobe come January might be outliers, the winter months are infamous for good reason. In fact, the National Institute of Health estimates an average weight gain of one pound owed to holiday indulgences.
But like all diets, nothing is set in stone. With help from Patricia Barber, USC’s resident registered dietitian, here are a few ideas that can help curb the tide of a heavy holiday.
Keep Your Routine:
Eating around the holidays, particularly Thanksgiving, promotes a twisted idea of “strategizing” for meals. Suggestions of skipping meals and fasting as a means of expanding your consumption capacity are substantially misguided.
In fact, when trying to maintain a healthy weight, going without food — particularly breakfast — is one of the most disadvantageous approaches.
Waking up in the morning, your body has exhausted its reserves of glycogen, which store the blood sugar needed to function. Even a quick nutritional reload — an apple or some cereal — gets the body working with enough fuel to make it through the day.
In fact, countless studies have shown that people who skip breakfast are more likely to be physically inactive throughout the day.
Some scientists have even proposed an evolutionary basis for breakfast. In the old hunter-gatherer days, if prehistoric man woke up without something to eat, his metabolism would hold tight to every precious calorie, in case the next meal was days off.
This way there would be something in the fat reserves to provide energy while roaming the plains.
Fortunately, modern man rarely has any uncertainty about his next meal, but the same evolutionary triggers still lay dormant. Going without breakfast tells your body the food supply is inconsistent; as a result, metabolism slows down and the body hoards every calorie for the presumably inevitable famine.
Even a small meal to start the day signals to your body that food is here to stay and kicks your metabolism into gear.
Cheat:
After a few weeks of holiday eating, your eyes will begin to glaze over with the prospect of another baked good spread loaded with cookies, bars and treats with above and beyond the daily amounts of sugar, butter and processed white flour.
One small inroad in the waistband war is to cheat your way through cooking; few recipes are set in stone, and some good substitutions can go miles toward your health.
The most familiar step in baking is to tote out the bag of white flour and dump it into your mixing bowl. Stripped of any nutrients or protein, white flour appears strikingly similar to sugar in your body. It spends little time being metabolized and quickly leaves you feeling hungry.
Try substituting any variety of wheat flours for some or all of the flour in a recipe. Particularly, the protein in whole wheat will leave a lasting sensation of fullness, keeping you away from the seconds. Some options include:
1. Whole wheat flour: Regular whole-wheat flour is fairly dense and can be hard to incorporate into a recipe without leaving a dry, brick-like product. Try replacing a third of the required flour and increase from there depending on results.
2. Whole wheat pastry flour: Pastry flour is aerated and noticeably lighter than its non-pastry cousin, meaning it can blend seamlessly into recipes. With a low gluten content, only substitute half of the recipe’s amount in breads, but for items such as cookies, scones, or brownies, pastry flour can be a one-to-one alternative.
3. White whole wheat flour: Milled from the white wheat plant (versus the traditional red wheat), white whole wheat flour behaves like white flour but packs the nutritional punch of wheat. It can be substituted one-to-one in recipes.
Fat content is another area ripe with opportunities to cheat. Start small — in almost all baking and culinary situations, low fat or soymilk can tag in for whole seamlessly (be careful only with custards, which depend heavily on the amount of fat, not the amount of dairy).
A real caloric home run can come from replacing the oil in recipes. The main function of oil is to keep the dish moist; replacing with a wet alternative does this as well. For lighter cakey or sugary desserts, used unsweetened applesauce as a one-to-one substitute (or half oil, half applesauce for a denser result).
When working with chocolate, go one-to-one with prunes run through the blender or any prune puree baby food. Since these substitutes are water, not fat-based, they are best soon after cooking.
Embrace the Sentiment:
Food around the holidays — more so than any other time of year — has that warm, fuzzy aura of nostalgia clouding our judgment. The impulse is to overdose on pumpkin, cranberries and peppermint.
There is nothing wrong with embracing these desires; food is strongly tied to our emotional memory, and what we eat contributes to our sense of a “successful,” joyous holiday season.
Moreover, denial of a food craving simply intensifies it — wanting a slice of pecan pie today morphs into gorging on an entire pie next week. So, if there are cornerstone foods for you this winter, eat them, savor them and move on. In fact, guilt about eating can often be as damaging mentally as fatty, salty foods are physically.
The one caveat, however, is to make sure to compensate your festive eating with similar reductions; the ubiquitous bag of Tostitos or 2-liter Sprite at a potluck is the same in December as it is in July; take a pass on these as you load up on latkes.
So don’t let the holiday season be a catalyst for looser jeans or a sudden obsession with fasting. It’s the holidays — be smart with what you eat but have fun.

From its beginnings, Glee promised good, old-fashioned high school choir fun.
But once the ball got rolling, the show upped the harmonies and tackled covers of hits from iconic stars ranging from Lady Gaga to Queen. No one was left behind in this music-filled flurry, from Jane Lynch as Madonna to the madness of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. 
And now, they’re covering the King of Pop himself.
The episode will run after the Super Bowl and will feature not a complete tribute in usual Gleek fashion, but a performance of “Thriller,” mixed in with another song, which has yet to be revealed.
With such an ambitious cover and the sponsorship of General Motors, the show will either ring heavenly notes in Gleeks’ hearts or fall short of die-hard Michael Jackson fans and any choir-hating counterparts.

Sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard was named to the Pac-10 All-Academic second team Tuesday, the only Trojan player to receive the honor this year. Kennard is majoring in communication at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism. He has maintained a 3.37 grade point average while managing his time between studies and sports.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley, redshirt sophomore offensive lineman Khaled Holmes and redshirt junior offensive lineman Michael Reardon all received honorable mentions on the All-Academic team.
In order to be named to the All-Academic team, the student-athlete needed higher than a 3.0 GPA and also needed to be a starter or a significant substitute on the team.
USC had the least amount of players on the All-Academic team. Every other Pac-10 school had at least three players named to either the first or second team. Washington State led the pack, with seven first-team players on the roster. Stanford had 11 All-Academic players overall, with four on the first team.
First-year special teams coach John Baxter is highly regarded for his “academic game plan” which teaches students about study skills and organization tactics. During his tenure as special teams coach at Fresno State, 141 players from his team were named to the WAC All-Academic team. Baxter has begun to implement the “Academic Gameplan” at USC, which should lead to a heavier Trojan presence on the All-Academic team.

In the last few months (and the last few years), Kanye West has been everywhere.  His tweets have become the must-read literature of the year for their ridiculously egotistic nature (sample tweet: “Hotel robe got me feeling like a sheik”).
He’s released several controversial album covers, performed at the VMAs and apologized to George Bush on national television for his infamously accusatory comments during the Hurricane Katrina telethon.
Perhaps his most perplexing and most creative artistic move was the strangely captivating 45 minute film he released on his website entitled Runaway.
All of this promotion and media attention will lead Kanye to the release of his fifth studio album on Tuesday, entitled My Beautiful Dark, Twisted Fantasy. Based on the official track list of the album, many of the songs have already been released as free downloads through Kanye’s weekly G.O.O.D. Friday promotion on his website or previewed in Runaway.
As followers of the free releases know, almost all of these songs are feature-heavy (and almost all feature former Clipse rapper and newest G.O.O.D. music member Pusha T, whose lyrics about dealing cocaine are only tolerable for so long).
With all of these free releases it will be interesting to see how many fans flock to the stores (digital music stores count, too) for the album release.  Acts such as Radiohead and Girl Talk have already proven that there’s still money to be made if an album is given away mostly for free, but it remains to be seen how many albums Kanye West will sell this Tuesday.

The UC Board of Regents approved an 8 percent tuition hike on Thursday morning for students in the statewide public school system.
The hike, which will go into effect the next school year, adds up to about an $822 fee increase for undergraduate students.
The board voted 15 to 5 in favor of the increase, with student regent Jesse Cheng and alumni regent Darek DeFreece among the “No” votes.
“Those are the ones who are silently crying. They are not at the microphone,” DeFreece said. “They are at work trying to figure out how they are going to pay for it all.”
Though families making less than $120,000 will not be affected by the hike next year, DeFreece said it is the middle class families that will suffer the most from the additional tuition fee.

The terms of USC’s relationship with the neighborhood in which it’s situated are notoriously difficult to pin down.
Although university officials have long advocated for student engagement with the surrounding area, the pervasive paranoia many students experience when faced with the prospect of exploring their surroundings on foot — a feeling somewhat validated by the university’s eager provision of a Campus Cruiser service — keeps many members of the USC student body from ever truly experiencing some of the local architectural marvels that the North University Park area has to offer.
Hidden gem - The Stimson Residence on South Figueroa street is one of the many architectural highlights in the neighborhood. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
This sort of institutionalized isolation is unfortunate, if only for the reason that it’s easier to take in great architecture from a sidewalk than through the window of a car. The greater University Park neighborhood boasts a truly remarkable richness of sites, all of which are best experienced on foot.
And with one absolutely necessary exception, all of these often-overlooked structural wonders can be found south of West Adams Boulevard.
One of the area’s most prominent landmarks might well be the former Second Church of Christ Scientist (948 W. Adams Blvd.), which has only recently been occupied by The Art of Living Foundation (so recently, in fact, that the Google Map street view image of the edifice features “Available Location For Filming” banners stretched across chain-link fences in front of the entrance).
The enormous structure bears a discreet bronze plaque near the steps leading up to its main entrance that recognizes it as an historic site — it was completed between 1907 and 1910 and features Italian Renaissance architecture. An imposing arcade of Corinthian columns stands guard before the main entrance, but the most impressive part of the one-time church is its tremendous green dome, easily visible from nearby freeways.
Sunshine Mission-Casa de Rosas (2600 S. Hoover St.) is similarly high-profile but more for historic reasons than in the sense that its profile is a recognizable part of our neighborhood’s skyline. Built in 1892 as part of the burgeoning kindergarten movement, the Sunshine Mission has served as home to budding debutantes and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard at different times in its rich history.
It wasn’t until after World War II, however, that the building assumed its current role as a shelter for women who have fallen on hard times as a result of domestic or substance abuse. Every year, Sunshine Mission collaborates with USC occupational therapy students to provide residents a hot Thanksgiving meal.
As a matter of fact, the university’s Center for Occupation and Lifestyle Redesign has set up permanent shop right across Hoover in the historic Cockins House (2653 S. Hoover St.). The majestic Queen Anne Victorian residence was designed and constructed in 1894 by a noted Los Angeles architectural firm and, though three-stories high, it functioned as a single-family residence until it was converted into a duplex in 1911.
It’s rumored that Charlie Chaplin once stayed there while the building operated as a boarding house, and now a decidedly creepy effigy of the silent film star is situated on the balcony of one of the upper levels, presumably to scare the living daylights out of any reporters who might happen to be riding their bikes around at night to do research for an article.
Student-saturated 27th Street is a veritable repository for beautiful residences as well. For fear of issuing an unauthorized invitation to admire fellow Trojans’ living arrangements, specific house numbers won’t be mentioned, but the stretch of 27th between Orchard Avenue and Hoover is particularly dense with beautiful Victorian homes, including the SoCal VoCal house.
Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 212, the Stimson Residence (2421 S. Figueroa St.), is the last remaining mansion in a line of costly manors along Figueroa that was once adoringly referred to as “Millionaire Row.”
Declared an historic site in 1979, this structure is said to be the city’s last standing example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. The Los Angeles Times once called it “the costliest and most beautiful private residence in Los Angeles,” but the beauty of visiting a site in person is that you can make such judgments yourself.
Much of North University Park’s most impressive architectural gems have histories that can hardly be done justice in print. The Saint Vincent de Paul Catholic Church and the Automobile Club of Southern California Building — situated on the northwest and southwest corners of the intersection of Adams and Figueroa, respectively — are staggering when seen in person, but tours such as Angels Walk LA enhance the experience of seeing Los Angeles on foot by pairing sights with history.
Whether you bike or walk, exploring these architectural wonders is well worth the time spent out of the car.

Even though Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief John Thomas is a Bruin, he admits his ties with USC go much deeper than those with his alma mater.
DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said connecting students with DPS officers is one of his foremost priorities for the department. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
After growing up in the neighborhood surrounding USC’s campus, patrolling the area around the university as an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and now serving as a top DPS official, Thomas calls USC home.
“Even as a UCLA student, I spent most of my time studying at USC — but I didn’t wear my [Bruin] gear, obviously,” Thomas said with a laugh. “I studied in Doheny Library, VKC … USC was more my home.”
Thomas’ familiarity with USC began during his childhood. He grew up near campus, and, even after moving to a different part of Los Angeles, spent every summer up until college with his grandparents, who still live nearby.
As a child, Thomas said that USC was entirely different from the neighborhood he lived in — a place he could go to feel safe.
“Students take it for granted, but it was like night and day stepping on that campus. The first time [I walked on campus] was like walking into Disneyland for the first time,” Thomas said. “[In the neighborhood], people slept in bathtubs because they were afraid of stray bullets coming in through their walls — this kind of stuff happened all the time.”
USC’s impact on the neighborhood itself was incredible, Thomas  said. The area around campus had a movie theater, a grocery store and an arcade in the University Village that he and other members of the community visited often. Many areas in South Central Los Angeles didn’t even have one of those, he said, let alone all three.
The greatest impact USC had on Thomas, however, was motivating him to excel academically and strive toward higher education. Thomas said that being surrounded by an academic environment made him see college as a real option.
Eventually, he became the first person in his family to attend college, going to UCLA and majoring in political science.
“I don’t say it lightly as a Bruin, but if I hadn’t lived in close proximity to USC, college would not have even been on my radar,” Thomas said. “It would have been just words from my teacher. It wasn’t a tangible thing. I would not have been taking AP classes. I would have been like so many of my peers who just wanted to get out of high school.”
After graduating college, Thomas enrolled in the LAPD Police Academy. During Thomas’ 21 years at LAPD, he monitored the same neighborhood he grew up in: South Central Los Angeles. Thomas worked in patrol, undercover narcotics and gang units. He also collaborated with former LAPD Chief William Bratton  — the man many say revolutionized law enforcement strategy in the city — as his adjutant.
After fulfilling his goal of working at LAPD for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant, Thomas decided he wanted to go into a different branch of law enforcement. He worked for a brief time at the University of the District of Columbia but soon decided to return to his roots, becoming a captain at DPS four years ago.

“In the first meeting [at DPS], I looked at all the officers and said, ‘There is no place on this campus that I am not familiar with. The buildings may have changed, but I know every inch,” Thomas said.
“I know all the hiding places,” he added. “I used to climb the trees outside of Moreton Fig as a kid.”
Two years ago, Thomas was promoted to assistant chief of DPS, the position he holds today. His job includes overseeing patrol operations, communications and investigations. He says that his knowledge of the area — both from his time at LAPD and his childhood — has greatly influenced the work he does.
At DPS, Thomas said he aims to educate students about law enforcement and build relationships with officers and students in less traditional ways, ultimately showing students that DPS is there to help them.
Thomas emphasized the need for transparency between officers and students at USC, something he said arises from his own personal experiences. While living as a minority in South Central Los Angeles, Thomas said he was often detained because he “fit the description” of a suspect and that he was threatened for asking why he was detained.
He is determined to make sure that no student feels mistreated at USC.
“This is your department, and if you feel like you were not treated properly, there are avenues for you to pursue,” Thomas said about his relationship with students. “For me, it’s personal — I haven’t been beaten, but I have been threatened and I have been handcuffed without justification just for asking, ‘Can you explain to me why I was stopped?’”
“No one is meant to feel that way,” he said.
Now, Thomas said he sees the difference in the neighborhood that he grew up in, calling it considerably safer than it was even 10 years ago. Crime has gone down significantly, there are no open drug or narcotics markets, and gang activity has gone down — progress Thomas said can be attributed to USC and its relationship with the community.
Looking to the future, Thomas said he hopes to build a stronger relationship between DPS officers and students, as well as make DPS more professional and continue to drive down crime in the community.
Thomas also hopes that USC will continue its relationship and work with the low-income communities in its neighborhood, something he said he feels President C. L. Max Nikias and the university are accomplishing — and something, he said, that is vital for the people who, like him, grow up with USC.
“Living around USC was monumental for me and so many other kids,” Thomas said. “It had an impact on my life and it will continue to have an impact on countless other lives.”

Not many Trojans can say they’ve been a part of the USC family from infancy, but Jairo Umana can.
The Information Technology Services staff member kick-started his career at the Multimedia University Academy, a USC neighborhood outreach program that offered at-risk, inner-city kids opportunities in multimedia. But his USC education didn’t begin there.
Umana attended a USC Head Start preschool before moving on to 32nd Street Elementary School across the street from USC and adjacent to the Shrine Auditorium. The K-12 school also includes the USC Math, Science and Technology High School, Umana’s alma mater.

“His entire life has been really shaped by and molded by USC programs,” said Kim Thomas Barrios, executive director of the USC Neighborhood Academic Initiative Program, who has followed Umana’s academic and professional careers.
32nd Street is also a part of the USC Family of Schools program, the brainchild of former USC President Steven B. Sample, which has had a lasting impact on the university and its surrounding community.
Sample assumed presidency of the university in 1991, a tenuous period in Los Angeles history. Census data from the year before painted a dismal picture of education in the area — 30 percent of Los Angeles County residents older than 25 had not finished high school. More than 26 percent of teenagers between 16 and 19 years old were not even enrolled in school.
But the communities that surrounded USC — including Umana’s — saw significantly higher numbers than the rest of the county.
In an address to students, staff and community members shortly after the Los Angeles riots in 1992, Sample made community engagement a priority — specifically within schools.
“We want parents from all over the region to look at our community schools and say, ‘That’s where I want to send my child,’” he said.
“There were five initiatives that he outlined for the neighborhood in terms of engagement with the university, and one of those was education,” Barrios said. “That’s when the Family of Schools was born.”
It began as a partnership between USC and the five neighborhood schools nearest the university — Foshay Learning Center, Norwood Street Elementary School, Vermont Avenue Elementary School, Lenicia B. Weemes Elementary School and 32nd Street School/USC Magnet School.
The original schools are now referred to as the “Family of Five,” but the Family of Schools has since added 10 more schools near the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus to its roster.
The outreach didn’t stop there.
In 1994, Sample created the Good Neighbors Campaign, a fundraising effort aimed at USC faculty and staff. Since then, more than $11 million has been donated to support programs that not only supplement English and math education but revive arts programs that are  often among the first to disappear when district budget cuts are made.
“Music education pretty much went the way of the dodo,” Barrios said. “When money’s tight and students need English and math instruction, the money’s going to go to English and math instruction.”
The Family of Schools didn’t invent community engagement, as several high-profile USC service groups, such as the Joint Educational Project and the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, existed long before the Family of Schools. But even if they were connected to the community, the programs were disengaged from each other.
The Family of Schools pulls these programs together so that they’re working toward unified goals specific to each school, Barrios said.
“The principals are engaged,” said Barrios, who meets with each principal to discuss their schools’ needs and goals. “What is it that they would really like to see happen with a partnership with USC?”
Lynn Brown, the principal of Weemes is a part of such discussions — but not just with Barrios.
“I’ve met with USC students, USC readers, students who tutor our children during the day and after school,” Brown said.
USC President C. L. Max Nikias has also made an effort to reach out by visiting 10 of the 15 schools to better understand their needs.
“It’s been a wonderful experience for me to visit them on their grounds,” Nikias said in a Nov. 9 discussion with USC students. “I had a hard time going to sleep in the evenings. I was having a lot of ideas of what we can do to make a difference, especially for the kids.”
Now the differences come in the form of more than 400 USC service programs. Weemes benefits from several of these, including Kid Watch, a safety initiative where volunteers direct traffic and help get students safely walk from their cars and into school.
“Kid Watch, because of USC, has helped get our parents trained by the Department of Transportation to do what we [do],” Brown said.
The list doesn’t end there. JEP, one of USC’s oldest programs, sends tutors and teacher’s assistants to the schools. KUSC Kids exposes children and their families to classical music. After School Sports Connection offers students an instruction in a variety of activities, including swimming, soccer and martial arts.
Still, the Family of Schools doesn’t just benefit the community’s kids.
Emily Brooke, a sophomore majoring in sociology, is the assistant coordinator of the USC Readers Program efforts at Norwood. She said her experience has been inspiring.
“We were teaching them geography and they couldn’t put Los Angeles in California,” Brooke said. “Seeing that happen around me makes me want to make sure they have an opportunity to learn and that they love learning.”
“It’s a symbiotic relationship, you don’t just get a good feeling — you actually know that you’ve made a huge difference,” Barrios said.
No research is available about the measurable changes the USC Family of Schools has made overall, Barrios said, but statistics for each of the programs have shown a positive reflection of the their effectiveness.
Ninety-five percent of the students are accepted to higher education institutions. Eighty-three percent of those go to a four-year university, Barrios said.
And 35 percent, like Umana, end up attending USC.
“Now we’re an elementary school. People aren’t really thinking about college,” Brown said. “But one of my goals this year is to make sure that every student from kindergarten to fifth grade says that they’re going to USC.”
This is a huge win for both USC as well as the surrounding schools. Why are we not hearing more about this sort of thing happening in other locations?

On April 29, 1992, Los Angeles erupted.
Large chunks of the city were shredded and set aflame as Angelenos clashed with police officers and violence spread throughout the city. Witnesses compared the looting, burning buildings and shootings in South Central to a war zone — and the area immediately surrounding USC was in the heart of the chaos.
The riots began when tensions between the black community in South Central and LAPD were stressed after a video of officers beating Rodney King — a black man — during a traffic stop was nationally broadcast. The officers were put on trial and acquitted — sparking the violent eruption of the riots, many of which took place in the area around  USC.
The university, however, sustained  only minor damage. Although thousands of Angelenos were injured and 53 died, only four students were injured and none were hospitalized. Twelve thousand people were arrested, seven of them USC students. Students and buildings were robbed, but USC was relatively untouched compared to the estimated $1 billion in citywide property damage.
Complete coverage · Though the Daily Trojan had ended production for the semester, it printed a special edition covering the 1992 riots to inform students of the events — including rioting and looting — that were occurring. | Daily Trojan file photo
Still, USC went into lockdown, enforcing the 9 p.m. citywide curfew and adding measures to protect students. The Row and much of off-campus housing was evacuated, according to Daily Trojan reports. Students in Parkside Apartments and the North University Park area were moved to Birnkrant Residential College, the Lyon Center and Webb or Fluor towers.
An emergency earthquake drill had been held the week before the riots broke out, and the Emergency Operations Center was utilized to deal with the disarray caused by the riots. The Division of Student Affairs was open 24/7 to field calls.
A non-university man was shot in the leg on campus near Parking Structure A, and when an ambulance failed to arrive, university security had to commandeer an escort van to take him to California Hospital, according to a Daily Trojan report.
Former USC President Steven B. Sample rode along on a routine security patrol on the second day of rioting with a police lieutenant, who told the Daily Trojan that Sample’s eyes were “as big as his head.”
The university also had very visible security on and around campus. Students and alumni volunteers helped patrol buildings, USC security officials worked double shifts, LAPD officers ate at Everybody’s Kitchen and the National Guard was headquartered at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“It was not simply a miracle that USC came through unscathed; rather, it was in large part because of the hard work and dedication of thousands of individuals who love this university and the community of which it is a part,” Sample said in a letter published in a special edition of the Daily Trojan.
This sense of community helped the university endure the riots and helped shape it after the violence ended.
Reverend Cecil “Chip” Murray, now an adjunct professor in the USC School of Religion, served as reverend of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church for 27 years, including during the riots.
Daily Trojan file photo
“When the burning, the looting and the rioting started, USC was exempt because the community considered it a part of it,” Murray said. “USC did not pick up and run from the community. It did not isolate itself. It said, ‘We are part of the community; it is part of us.’”
Other schools did not do the same when faced with similar crises. Pepperdine University, now located on the bluffs of Malibu, Calif., once sat in South Central Los Angeles. After the Watts riots of 1965 broke out near the campus, deeply rattling the Pepperdine community, administrators began to look for new locations for the college. Two years later, the land in Malibu was offered to school officials, and in 1972, the new campus opened.
“USC could have found another place. It could have found another fortune among the most fortunate,” Murray said. “Even if it had chosen to stay as the impoverished communities began to surround it, it could have built walls — not just mental, but physical walls — to keep people out.”
Murray said this more welcoming mentality also deters criminals from targeting the university now.
“Even today, the crime rate — you have some criminals and you get reports from our public defenders here on campus — it could be 20 times worse,” he said. “But the image is such that we welcome free thinking. We welcome free thinkers. We welcome all who are within our reach.”
After the riots, Sample offered use of USC’s facilities and services to the city in its efforts to rebuild Los Angeles, which were headed by Peter Ueberroth, a lifetime member of the USC Board of Trustees.
“Let me encourage all of us to share our good fortune and deliverance by lending a hand to those of our neighbors who have suffered directly from this tragedy,” Sample said at the time. “USC has played an integral part in the life of this city for more than a century, and I expect we’ll play an even more important part in the years immediately ahead.”
Daily Trojan file photo
At the time, USC was involved in more than 60 different outreach programs, reaching nearly 250,000 children yearly. That number would continue to grow under Sample’s leadership. The Neighborhood Academic Initiative, which gives local children the chance to earn a full scholarship to the university if they complete a six-year academic program on campus, and the Joint Educational Project, which pairs university students with local children as mentors, are both still active.
Murray said that programs like JEP continue to make USC accessible, a key aspect of making the university a neighbor in the community.
“The fact that, in the poorest sections of South Central, when I said, ‘I’m out at USC,’ I hear, ‘Oh yeah, yeah — that’s our school.’ From a person who may not have completed seventh, eighth grade — ‘our school.’ It’s because ‘our school’ reaches out,” he said. “If we were not reaching out, this would be an island mentality because people would be awed by this world university and not even come to the campus and come on tours. The campus doesn’t wait for the people to come to it — it goes to the people.”
USC also created its own volunteer organization after the riots, the Coalition in Response to Civil Unrest, led by Professor of Religion Alvin Rudisill. The coalition submitted a report on improving race relations in the community on June 23, 1992 — about two months after rioting ended on May 4, when the city curfew was lifted.
The report gave two recommendations: to promote discussions, dialogues and lectures about the community, and to encourage diversity. It also noted that USC faculty should incorporate city issues into their courses.
Most students don’t remember the time when these riots happened — many freshmen were born after they occurred. There have also been myriad changes in city policy since 1992, which has altered the conditions that led to the riots.
Daily Trojan file photo
Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism Professor Judy Muller covered the Rodney King trials and said the mentality of the police force helped create the tension that sparked the violence.
“Back then, police had a mentality of us versus them. They went into these neighborhoods like it was a war zone — there was no community policing,” Muller said. “Now, that’s all changed. Today, if something like this happened, I don’t think you’d see that kind of an eruption.”
Murray said his experience in Los Angeles has led him to the conclusion that USC’s inclusive philosophy has been a leading factor in the university’s rise in national and international standings.
“Living in the south of Los Angeles, and talking with the people of all levels … being minister of First AME church for 27 years … you get to hear a lot. I am not certain that I have ever heard negative expressions regarding the University of Southern California,” he said. “There obviously had to be a time in its earliest days when it was enshrouded with racism and discrimination [but] in the last 25-30 years … we have seen firsthand the profits of being inclusive rather than being exclusive.”
“We could never walk backwards,” Murray said. “We can only go on.”

You can’t blame USC for looking forward.
Our university is still rising in stature at a breakneck pace. In two decades we have begun to transition from a commuter to a residential school, seen our admission rate plummet by 46 percent and leapfrogged over our crosstown rival in the U.S. News & Word Report rankings, resting at No. 23.
With the torch passed to newly inaugurated President C. L. Max Nikias, future Trojans can expect exciting improvements to the school’s landscape as well as its prestige. With an expected remodeling of the area surrounding campus in the plans, USC is staged to become an integral part of Los Angeles, a leader in the nation, and a powerhouse on the international stage.
But as the university continues growing, it cannot overlook one of the most important factors influencing its every move. How do we make sure that USC’s expansion doesn’t come at the expense of the surrounding community?
As administrators, staff and students eagerly look into the university’s future, we encourage our university to look into the past and let our storied history with the community serve as a road map for the coming years.
In his short time as president, Nikias has already emphasized the importance of community engagement.
From touring the USC Family of Schools and promising additional support to planning a job development initiative for local businesses, it’s clear that Nikias understands not only how important USC is to its neighbors but how important the community is to the university.
It’s time for all of USC to follow suit. Students must go beyond their traditional service-learning experiences and other high-ranking administrators must venture outside of their offices for us to truly understand the area that surrounds us.
A crucial part of that understanding is knowing how our current relationship came to be.
“We live in a community, and we live for a community,” Nikias told students earlier this month.
It’s time to take these words to heart.

Located in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the world, it’s no surprise that USC’s Department of Public Safety works closely with the Los Angeles Police Department to ensure the university’s safety.
Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan
“LAPD is not here dealing with the students smoking marijuana or drinking alcohol underage, but certainly anytime you’ve got arrests, we’re working together with them, and if there is any kind of investigation, we’re working together with them,” DPS Chief Carey Drayton said. “Because of this, the campus community and the citizens in this community are safer because there are more people working on the same issue — and that is safety in the community.”
Shaped and fostered by a series of Memorandums of Understanding between DPS and LAPD, the relationship between the two entities changed during preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.
With several of the Olympics’ main venues located in and around USC, including housing for the Olympic athletes on campus and the use of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for events, the summer of 1984 was the turning point in which LAPD became more closely linked with DPS.
When Drayton joined DPS in 2005, he facilitated additional changes to the standing memorandum because the university had grown since the last time the memorandum was put together. Drayton adjusted boundaries for what areas of the USC campus and surrounding neighborhoods were public safety patrol areas, public safety response areas and LAPD reporting districts. Additionally, the position of LAPD senior lead officer was altered so that the individual’s sole jurisdiction is USC.
On a day-to-day basis, LAPD and DPS officers work together intricately, communicating on every hour of every watch.
“We’re working together closely and doing things every day, so when something major happens or if something occurs … I don’t have to call up some stranger,” Drayton said. “It’s somebody that we deal with on a fairly regular basis.”
In addition to communicating and sharing information, DPS and LAPD work hand-in-hand to assist each other in different areas. Through the current memorandum with LAPD, DPS officers have limited arrest powers, though anyone arrested by DPS must be delivered to a LAPD officer without unnecessary delay.
LAPD also helps DPS follow up on crimes reported to DPS. According to Sgt. Brent McGwyre of LAPD’s Southwest division — which presides over USC and the majority of the surrounding area — has officers and a detective assigned to the USC area.
In return, LAPD often calls DPS to handle crimes dealing with students which, as at any university campus, frequently involve students who have had too much to drink.
“In the field, oftentimes if we encounter a USC student, and we feel that it’s better recourse to have them handled via the school, then we can call DPS officers to come and deal with the student.
Typically this is with students that are drunk in public,” McGwyre said. “We as LAPD officers can arrest them for being drunk in public, but sometimes it’s in the best interest of all the parties involved that it’s handled administratively with USC.”
As the relationship between DPS and LAPD has steadily strengthened over recent years, crime statistics have shifted.
“Crime has significantly been dropping in and around the USC campus,” McGwyre said. “And some of that is because of the relationship that has developed between the two agencies.”
According to the 2010 DPS Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, the number of burglaries, robberies, motor vehicle thefts and aggravated assaults on campus are down from last year, though liquor and drug law referrals have skyrocketed — liquor referrals jumped from 29 in 2008 to 107 in 2009, and drug referrals from 47 in 2008 to 95 in 2009.
Off-campus, drug law referrals and burglaries have decreased significantly, while liquor law arrests have increased. The numbers of cases dealt with by LAPD has risen for most crimes.
For larger issues that arise, DPS operates using  what it calls the Instant Command System. Although all USC cases start out being handled by DPS, the department that ends up in charge depends on the type of incident.
“On any major incident that happens, we start out with a single command, with us being in place, and then depending upon the situation, we develop a unified command system that would include LAPD, the Los Angeles Fire Department and others,” Drayton said. “As federal reports after 9/11 showed, it was the lack of inter-agency cooperation that caused some of the problems that were generated on the day of 9/11. Just like those kinds of relationships hurt, our relationship conversely helps.”
Freshman Ellen Kaster, an out-of-state student who said she isn’t very familiar with the area surrounding USC, said she was reassured to hear of the close relationship between DPS and LAPD when touring the school, especially after hearing negative stereotypes about the USC neighborhood.
“It’s comforting to know that the safety of our campus is reinforced by such a strong entity that is the LAPD,” said Kaster, a freshman majoring in public relations. “If there was a real problem, it’s good to know that DPS works so closely with the LAPD.”
Caitlin Dowling, a freshman majoring in communication, said she is also impressed with the strength of DPS and the LAPD, specifically their presence on campus.
“The other day I got an e-mail about someone’s personal property being recovered,” Dowling said. “That is amazing and a sign of the growth of our public safety department.”
Drayton anticipates that the relationship between DPS and LAPD will continue to strengthen in years to come, and both agencies will work to provide the other with what is needed to make the USC community safer. McGwyre agreed.
“Anytime DPS needs anything, if it’s in our power to do it, we’ll do it for them, and vice versa,” McGwyre said.

A lackluster effort defined practice for the second day in a row, according to USC coach Lane Kiffin, who mentioned a lack of intensity from his players on Wednesday.
Its own worst enemy · USC coach Lane Kiffin said the Trojans have been unfocused in practice this week. The coaches upped the intensity Wednesday, but the players didn’t sustain it the entire practice. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
“I don’t know whether it’s guys feeling good about themselves after a couple wins [and] not remembering [that] why we’ve played well lately is because we’ve practiced extremely well,” Kiffin said.
Kiffin said the coaching staff tried to up the intensity at the beginning of practice on Wednesday, and though the Trojans initially responded, they faded as practice wore on.
This is no time for a letdown as USC looks to finish off its season on a roll. The Trojans (7-3) can finish the season with 10 wins if they run the table in their final three games.
First stop is Corvallis, Ore., to face Oregon State on Saturday. The Trojans have not won in the state of Oregon in five years.
“I’ve lost every time I’ve gone up there, my whole career here,” senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said. “This is kind of the last one for me, so I’m giving every effort I can.”
The hype surrounding the matchup has lost traction after Washington State shocked the Beavers in Corvallis last week. Redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said that the Trojans, however, aren’t expecting the challenge to be any easier.
“We know that this is [the] game of their season,” he said. “We understand that they’re going to be coming out with all bullets. For us, I think we’ve just got to play our game.”
Meanwhile, Galippo refused to buy in to any talk of an Oregon curse.
“It’s not the state of Oregon, it’s more of us controlling our game,” he said.
For that to happen, Kiffin said he wants to see a turnaround from the “disappointing” level of passion the Trojans have shown this week. Still, there is time to get back on track before game day.
“There’s still enough time for us to get right and get ready to go up there,” Kiffin said.
—
As the season nears its end, injuries seem to be catching up with the Trojans — especially in the secondary.
Junior cornerback T.J. Bryant has a torn labrum in his left shoulder, an injury he first suffered in high school and one that he said has been recurring since. Bryant, who did not practice, is awaiting the results of an MRI, which will determine if he will play again this season.
Sophomore safety Jawanza Starling, who missed last week’s game with a sore hamstring, sat out of practice Wednesday, as did redshirt freshman cornerback Torin Harris.
“Unfortunately we thought we were going to be getting healthier, but we seem to not be getting healthier,” Kiffin said. “But we’ll go [to Oregon State] with however many we can get on the plane.”

A male graduate student was stabbed at the Arco gas station located at the intersection of Vermont Avenue and Exposition Boulevard Tuesday night, according to the Department of Public Safety.
The student argued with a suspect after walking into the A.M./P.M. mini mart at around 8:50 p.m., before the suspect stabbed the student in the chest, said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
The suspect, who has not been located, is described as a Hispanic male between 20 and 30 years old.
The student called 911 from his cell phone and was transferred to California Hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, Carlisle said.
Because the incident appears to be isolated, Carlisle said he did not believe students should be concerned.
“This sounds like [the student] wasn’t a person who was necessarily targeted for an assault or robbery,” Carlisle said.

Luckily for the USC men’s basketball team (2-1,  0-0), a 30-game season is a lot like life: It’s not black or white but rather shades of grey.
Pacing the way · USC freshman guard Maurice Jones (10) and senior guard Donte Smith led the Trojans with 13 points each in their loss to Rider. Jones and fellow freshman Bryce Jones combined to go 8-for-28 from the field and had seven turnovers. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
For the majority of Wednesday’s ugly 77-57 loss to Rider (2-1, 0-0), a calamity of errors over 40 hard-to-watch minutes cast a highly visible tone of darkness over what initially looked to be an impressive start to the 2010-2011 campaign.
The Trojans didn’t wait long to fall apart against the visiting Broncs in the Galen Center, spotting their New Jersey-based foes an 11-4 lead within the blink of an eye.
For most of the night, USC’s freshman backcourt — Maurice Jones and Bryce Jones — looked every bit their age with a bevy of bad misses, forced passes and defensive missteps. The two marquee players in USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s 2010 recruiting class finished a combined 8-for-28 shooting with seven turnovers.
Midway through the first half, O’Neill went to a temporary Plan B: senior guard Donte Smith.
After awkward misfires on his first two 3-point attempts, Smith connected on his next three shots to even the score at 21 a piece.
But USC’s much-improved Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference opponent didn’t cower under the L.A. spotlight and instead turned to its most-experienced scorers: guards Justin Robinson and Jhamar Youngblood.
The Broncs’ backcourt proved to be the better tandem heading into the locker room, going on a two-man 15-point run to give Rider coach Tommy Dempsey’s team a 36-27 lead after 20 minutes.
Just minutes in to the second half, it appeared the 15-minute intermission was all for naught, as the Broncs’ knocked down two long 3-point attempts off the hot hand of Robinson and guard Jonathon Thompson.
Three quick personal foul calls on junior forward Nikola Vucevic and a moving screen by senior guard Marcus Simmons later, and the Trojans found themselves staring at an insurmountable hole at 48-30 with 16 minutes to play.
And on a night in which highlights were few and far between, even when Maurice Jones tried to rally the troops with a few fancy dribble-drive penetration moves, O’Neill’s lackluster team found a way to squander any momentum the freshman from Saginaw, Mich., attempted to single-handedly create.
“We were outplayed A to Z,” a visibly frustrated O’Neill said after the game. “The bottom line is it’s unacceptable. We didn’t play the right way. We didn’t play together. We split apart.”
From quick-fire shots that fell aimlessly off the mark, to errant passes into the stands to two uncontested 3-point shots by Robinson, with just less than seven minutes to play, USC’s faulty comeback attempt came to a crashing halt, as the Broncs ungratefully poured it on en route to a 25-point lead with just more than six minutes left in the contest — the Trojans’ largest deficit of the young season.
When the final buzzer finally sounded to conclude a night even video tape wouldn’t do justice to, the boisterous Broncs and their senior star Robinson — who led all scores with 28 points on 9-of-10 shooting and 5-for-5 in 3-point attempts — walked out of the lifeless Galen Center with a 20-point victory that was never in doubt.
“I just thought we looked like we were in chill-out mode,” O’Neill said. “And we can’t be in chill-out mode against good teams.”
For the Trojans there simply was no silver lining in a game that was as grim as a nonconference home blowout can be. The listless squad gave up an uncharacteristic 12 field goals from behind the 3-point line — one more make than the Broncs had from 2-point range — and offensively failed to crack a rather basic 2-3 defensive zone that Rider employed throughout Wednesday’s one-sided matchup.
“It seems like nothing went right,” senior forward Alex Stepheson said. “Our defense wasn’t getting stops. And our offense was taking bad shots and making bad turnovers. It was just a terrible game for us.”
But the Trojans will have little time to dwell on their embarrassing home defeat, as the team wraps up the three-game Hall of Fame Classic Tournament this weekend on the road in Springfield, Mass., against Bradley University on Saturday and New Mexico State on Sunday.
“We are going to go up from here,” Stepheson said. “We’re young and so everyone is going to learn from it. We are just going to take this as a bad experience and move on.”
The team will return home next Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. to face inner-state foe Cal State Fullerton, in what it hopes will be an opportunity to prove that one night of enervated play doesn’t define the ultimate shade of their potentially bright future.

The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Wednesday to manufacturers of alcoholic energy drinks such as Four Loko about the dangers of added caffeine, but USC students say it’s the low price that makes these drinks so popular.
The FDA warning said the combination of caffeine and alcohol is dangerous and told manufacturers they must take action to reduce risks to those consuming the drinks.
“[Four Loko] is probably the most popular drink this semester,” said Charlie Scully, a senior majoring in business administration. “I’m not for it being banned, but I understand why.”
A 23.5-ounce can of Four Loko typically sells for less than $3, and one can is equivalent to about four 12-ounce beers.
Students such as Scully and Ari Jakobson, also a senior majoring in business administration, said most of their peers drink Four Loko because of its low price.
“It’s definitely a popular drink among my friends, partly because it’s so low-priced for the amount of alcohol it contains,” Jakobson said. “I think the negative publicity surrounding it recently also gives it a positive effect for college students who are looking to be a little crazier and rebel a little bit.”
“Drink one of those and you’re set for a while, and two of those you can go crazy,” Scully added. “People like that feeling.”
Health experts say the combination of caffeine and alcohol often results in students becoming unaware of how drunk they are, because of the masking effect of caffeine.
Four Loko contains 135 mg of caffeine in one can. When the caffeine wears off, drinkers feel the full effects of the alcohol.
“Four Loko is dangerous because it causes students to get drunk without even knowing it, causing impaired judgment and health issues,” said Jennifer Unger, a USC professor of preventative medicine.
Before the FDA warning, however, the maker of Four Loko, Phusion Projects Inc., already said it was removing the caffeine content from its drinks.
Four Loko has become popular among college students around the nation for several months, but it entered the national spotlight when nine students from Central Washington University were taken to the hospital after consuming the drink.
“It is likely that Four Loko is chugged, producing the effect of downing a half-pint of vodka,” said Steven Sussman, a professor at the Keck School of Medicine.
Four states — Washington, Michigan, Utah and Oklahoma — have already banned alcoholic energy drinks, but federal regulators have not confirmed that a national ban is imminent.
“Alcohol toxicity is a real issue here; students who down a can will get drunk unless they are heavy drinkers,” Sussman said. “What is needed is a large social climate change regarding what the rights of passage and entertainment in college might best be.”
Keely Flanagan, a junior majoring in screenwriting, said the effects of Four Loko aren’t always pleasant.
“When you finally sober up, you feel dizzy and really sick to your stomach. It’s like you’re hung over, but wired and wide awake so you can’t sleep it off,” she said. “I think it’s popular because of the mythology of it. It’s the drink of our generation — part energy drink, part alcohol. It’s like liquid nitrogen that won’t necessarily kill you.”

Gmail killer?
That’s what some are calling Facebook’s new messaging system, which was revealed by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday. Not that Zuckerberg himself said that.
“This is not an e-mail killer,” Zuckerberg said during the announcement. “This is a messaging system that includes e-mail as one part of it.”
And in many ways, Facebook Messages doesn’t seem to want to replace e-mail at all. Sure, it has an e-mail client — Facebook users will eventually be offered an
“@facebook.com” address, if they choose to have one — but at first glance it seems that Messages will simply be a better, more integrated way to communicate with your friends.
Text messages will rub shoulders with chat instant messages alongside e-mails, providing a seamless way to access all three without constantly switching between programs and clients.
So, there is no Gmail killer after all.
Zuckerberg, however, didn’t leave it at that. While stating it wasn’t about abolishing e-mail, he added another nugget of insight: “We don’t think a modern messaging system is going to be e-mail,” he said.
And although it might have just been subtext, it was this philosophy that reigned supreme in the announcement of the new system. Seemingly, Facebook isn’t out to fight traditional e-mail — instead, it’s saying that e-mail is slowly but surely receding to that shadowy technology graveyard where floppy disks and Windows Me reside.
This attitude is what led Facebook to apply some drastic changes to its e-mail client within the new messaging system. Exhibit A: no more subject lines. Exhibit B: no more blind carbon copies.
It’s hard to imagine e-mails being sent without subject lines, but in the eyes of Facebook, it’s simply not necessary. According to Zuckerberg, the future of messaging is defined by seven characteristics: seamless, informal, immediate, personal, simple, minimal and short.
Well, at least no one can claim that Facebook isn’t ambitious. Although the new system might be a very large step forward for web-based communications, it’s difficult to say if it really is the move that Zuckerberg wants it to be.
In a way, Zuckerberg’s vision of the future seems mildly utopian: Imagine a world where both bosses and friends and clients and partners communicate on the same platform, informally and in real time. It’s certainly optimistic, but Facebook might be making a critical error somewhere along the line in assuming that people are going to be able to fit into such a system.
After all, these are the same people that forced Google to ditch its “save everything, don’t delete, just search” approach with Gmail. With pressure from the public, a prominent delete button was finally added at a later date.
As for e-mail without subject lines? The public couldn’t even handle Gmail’s attempt to remove folder-based organization. Facebook intends on organizing all messages around the sender. This obviously will pay dividends in terms of communication with friends — say, going back-and-forth about plans for the weekend — but it’s hard to imagine how it’s logical in any other sense.
Technology of the future? Maybe, but not the near future.
One should also consider the issues with imagining a world where savvy workplace bosses and interns can interact over social media. For all of Facebook’s lofty goals, Zuckerberg has potentially squandered the possibilities of making Facebook more appealing to the old-school, double Windsor knot types.
Yes, Facebook is becoming more popular with older, more professional audiences, but the fact of the matter is that social media has always been the jungle of the young.
Zuckerberg’s idealistic view of “Facebook for all” is contradicted by his actions: Instead of more smoothly incorporating the familiar with the new, he’s decided that a radical approach is best. Although it’s impossible to say whether this tactic will fail, precedent — particularly in the experiments of Google with Gmail — doesn’t necessarily point to success.
Courage or foolhardiness? Time will tell.
One advantage Facebook does have over practically everyone else? It’s working backward. Whereas companies like Google have been hard at work trying to incorporate forward-thinking, interconnected qualities of social media to their foundations (see: Google Buzz), Facebook is looking back at how to innovate traditional mediums of communication.
This inherently puts them in a position ahead of the other usual web powers, such as aforementioned Google and Yahoo.
However, this advantage might disappear if Facebook charges too fast forward into the innovation abyss, leaving Zuckerberg to lick some unforeseen wounds. And as far as I can tell, there are a lot of people who are skeptical about the new messaging platform.
Of course, things are still in a very early stage; it’s not at all stupid to trust a company that has had explosive success in the recent past. Maybe this new form of messaging really will be a smashing hit.
But the doubts forming in people’s minds seem to signal that Facebook’s revolutionary mindset might not fly as well as Zuckerberg and company believe.
There’s a very crucial plot point in the film The Social Network, in which Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, chooses to nurture a growing population of users instead of risking the appeal of Facebook by chasing advertisement revenue. It’s implied that one aspect of Facebook’s rise to eminence was that its business model favored intuitiveness and user satisfaction above all else.
Zuckerberg and Facebook are rolling the dice by introducing a potentially polarizing new way of communicating. Sure, it looks like a great way to connect with your friends, but it’s a little overreaching to say that it’s the wave of the future. After all, it won’t be worth anything unless users take to it like fish to water. With all these question marks in the air, will they?
Something tells me it’s going to a long time before Zuckerberg’s communications utopia becomes reality.

These days, nobody is immune from curses.
There’s the Curse of the Bambino, which affected the Boston Red Sox for 86 years. Then there’s the Unforgivable Curses, which did not come from Harry Potter but actually that YouTube guy who just wanted a chicken sandwich and some waffle fries. Anybody in theater knows about the Curse of Macbeth, which has recently been changed to the Curse of McNabb since anybody who gives Donovan McNabb money must exit the stadium and punch themselves in the face three times before seeking permission to re-enter.
Run over · Senior running back Allen Bradford has yet to beat Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore., in his five years on the team. With the Beavers coming off a loss to Washington State, the Trojans have a good chance to win Saturday. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The USC Trojans are also suffering from a curse — the Curse of Corvallis.
For some reason, USC has had trouble winning at Oregon State, located in Corvallis, Ore. The Trojans have lost two in a row in the city that won the 2003 Sidewalk Award from the da Vinci Days Community and Design Committee.
But Saturday’s game presents the best opportunity for the Trojans to dash past the Beavers and break the curse.
Yes, the Trojans are ranked higher than the Beavers and are favored coming into this game. But that’s not why this year gives them the best chance to win. In fact, in the previous two losses USC had better odds of winning than those of Tony Parker and Eva Longoria breaking up. Both losses cost the Trojans shots at the national title. The 27-21 upset in 2008 came when USC was ranked No. 1 in the country, and the 33-31 loss two years prior came when the Trojans were ranked No. 3. Oregon State was unranked both times.
So, what happens in Corvallis?
“I couldn’t tell you,” senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said. “It’s kind of eerie because I haven’t won there yet in my career here. But we’re switching things up a little bit. I know we’re staying at a different hotel, so I think that might be the reason. I think they’re poisoning the water or something like that.”
It’s not like Oregon State has been untouchable at home, although the Beavers have been pretty good. In 2006, two of its four losses came at home. Since then, it has lost six home games over the last four years.
It’s just that USC has taken up camp at the bottom of Crater Lake. The Trojans haven’t won in the state of Oregon since 2005 and have lost eight of their last 11 games played in Oregon dating back to 1998. Part of the reason USC won the national title in 2003 was because it didn’t have a game in Oregon that year (in the interest of full disclosure, it did play in Oregon in 2004 and 2005 and won, though it eked out a 28-20 win in 2004 after going down 13-0 to the Beavers).
There are a couple things that set this year up so nicely for the Trojans to eradicate the angry Beavers. First, Oregon State is coming off of a humiliating loss to Washington State at home. Nobody loses to Washington State. Even Sarah Palin could beat Washington State.
So the Cougars, who got their first Pac-10 win since 2008, showed that there’s no magic to beating the Beavers in Corvallis. If that’s not the ultimate confidence booster for the Trojans, then they can take solace in this: UCLA beat the Beavers the week prior to Washington State’s first victory since the Great Depression.
For those of you who haven’t been following the Bruins this year — which I assume is a large majority because there really is no reason to — they are on about their sixth quarterback, although to their credit they do have a solid field goal kicker who’s made 10-of-13 field goals from 50-plus yards, including the game-winner to defeat the Beavers.
That’s all without mentioning that the Beavers are without half of their gin and tonic. They still got the gin, the smooth, silky, effective running back Jacquizz Rodgers, but the tonic, Rodgers’ big brother James — the Beavers’ primary receiving threat who neutralized defenses and kept them from focusing on Jacquizz — is out for the year after he injured his left knee against Arizona in early October.
However, that all focuses on other teams. Although this Trojan team is not as strong as the ones that visited Corvallis in 2008 and 2006, it nonetheless has the weapons to defeat the Beavers. Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley is tied for fourth in the nation with 25 touchdown passes, and redshirt junior running back Marc Tyler ran 31 times for 160 yards in last week’s win against then-No. 18 Arizona. The defense is finally coming into its own, especially the front seven, and freshman receiver Robert Woods looks to be cured after falling ill a few weeks ago.
Word on the street was that he was healed by a voodoo witch doctor from the middle of the Amazon Rainforest.
Yup, the time is right for the Trojans to go up to Corvallis and break the curse – once and for all.

Lane Kiffen is a great football coach who takes very challenging jobs.  Last night he had bad dreams of Quizz dancing past his d-line like Arthur Murray!
I guess you are right, we have a curse going.  I thought the Trojans would be better than they played last night. with the Pac-10 expansion maybe this thing can last 86 years.  Please keep Lane Kiffen as a coach because he is a proven winner as a head coach.  Only Notre Dame could use a coach like him.
I forgot that seven wins is not enough for a lame bowl for USC this year.  One more win and I am booking my tickets to El Paso.  Too bad Jim Harbaugh and Chip Kelly can coach.  Looks like no bowl game for either of us!
Don’t steal Brady Hoke from my other Alma mater – Dude can coach.  Let’s start at new curse at Qualcomm!
Kenny may be able to sing like Anne Murray, but two losses in Corvallis in the last twenty times that they have visited is not at all like not winning a World Series for 86 years.  As a long time Beaver Fan, I have watched dozens of games shivering it what is now called Reser Stadium as great tailbacks (Simpson, Allen,…) ran for hundreds of yards over my hapless Beavers.  Two in a row is not a curse, it’s just a historical blip.  
This game means nothing, as the Ducks and Stanford now are the teams to beat in the conference.  The winner of this game, hopefully my Beavers, will have a better shot at some meaningless bowl game. (Las Vegas,   Emerald, or, god forbid, the Sun Bowl).

The Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism will host a new innovation lab geared toward developing social technology that changes how people interact with media, it announced today.
Jonathan Taplin, an Annenberg professor who will serve as the director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab, said the lab will serve as a collaboration between those at the school and companies outside USC who want to be involved in the development of technology. The inspiration for the lab originally came from IBM executive Irving Wladawsky-Berger, Taplin said, who served as Annenberg’s first innovator in residence last year.
“It’s a place where the best students and professors across lots of different departments in USC can interface with the big corporations that are making media,” Taplin said. “What we’re trying to do is reinvent how media is delivered in the next 10 years.”
Companies such as IBM Corp., Verizon Wireless, Mattel Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co. will work to both fund the lab and create new projects with students and faculty members.
One of the main focuses of the lab will be interdepartmental collaboration at USC, Taplin said.
“We’re trying to make it very interdepartmental, people from the cinema school and people from the Rossier School of Education,” he said. “We have some very specific projects we’re working on.”
These projects include the creation of an eBook reader — so students will not have to carry textbooks to class — and geolocation devices. Students will also be involved with the lab in a series of design challenges, where they can win prizes for the best design innovations.
“We have very specific projects that are based in new tool sets for journalists,” he said. “It’s a place where many professors can interface with companies that are leading the change.”

It’s hard not to miss the turquoise-clad officers riding bikes along Figueroa Street, or the signs promoting the Figueroa Corridor that dot lampposts around USC. But the Figueroa Corridor Partnership does a lot more for the community than students might realize.

Established in 1998, the partnership — which includes the area between the Santa Monica (10) Freeway and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, and Flower Street and Vermont Avenue — aims to stimulate economic growth and make the Corridor attractive to businesses.
According to Steve Gibson, executive director of the partnership, the goal of the non-profit group is to promote a positive environment for businesses and customers.
“We want to provide clean and safe services, which are the basics for providing an enjoyable Corridor,” Gibson said.
The partnership was started by former USC President Steven B. Sample and Darryl Holter, current chair of the partnership’s Board of Directors and the CEO of the Shammas Group, a business made up of several properties based south of Downtown. Both men were troubled by the Corridor’s conditions in 1998 — and understandably so.
“The local Chevrolet dealer was told by General Motors to relocate to a better neighborhood, area museums saw attendance drop significantly [and] the University of Southern California had trouble recruiting students,” the partnership’s website reads.
After the partnership formed, things turned around.
The Corridor has attracted more than $2.2 billion in investments since the partnership’s inception, much of which has come in the form of new housing complexes and businesses, as well as a multi-million-dollar restoration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum completed in 2003.
“We have built new housing complexes such as University Gateway in order to stop profit-driven landowners from converting working-class properties into insufficient student housing,” Holter said.
The increase in investments has also had a positive effect on property owners, said Margret Farnum,  retired chief administrative officer of the Coliseum Commission.
“Property owners have taken more pride in their buildings and have upgraded them, creating a new sense of life in the area,” Farnum said.
Small businesses such as the Vagabond Inn have also profited from the partnership, according to Charles Valentino, the inn’s director of operations.
“With the removal of graffiti and cleanliness of the sidewalks, you can now tell when you go in and out of the Corridor,” Valentino said.
Also monitoring the Corridor’s streets are safety ambassadors, who patrol the area on bikes.
David Roberts, USC’s associate director of local government relations, said these ambassadors have worked tirelessly to make the Corridor a crime-free area.
“[They] are watchful eyes on the streets,” he said.
Even business owners operating outside the boundaries of the Corridor said they appreciated having that extra set of eyes.
“The bike control is a great calming influence on the Figueroa area,” said Patsy Carter, proprietor of The Inn at 657 located just outside the Corridor at 657 W. 23rd St.
But the partnership hasn’t just been good for businesses. USC continues to be an integral part of the partnership and has benefitted greatly from the improved Corridor, Roberts said.
“The partnership has changed the perspective of folks visiting USC and Exposition Boulevard and improved the quality of life in the Corridor and the surrounding neighborhoods,” he said.
The partnership has an annual budget of approximately $1 million. Members pay extra taxes based on their assessed property value, which is returned to the partnership from the government — extra money they say is well spent.
“In my 42 years working for the Coliseum, I have never felt so safe walking around the Corridor,” Farnum said. “It feels almost like home.”

When Time magazine and The Princeton Review named USC “College of the Year” in 2000, they praised the university for supporting “the most ambitious social-outreach program of any university in the nation.”
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
A decade later, USC’s commitment to community service has changed little — but its landscape has taken leaps and bounds. As the university continues to make the transition from a commuter to a residential school, it faces a difficult maneuver: how to accommodate the needs of a burgeoning student body without stepping on the toes of the community.
Approved by the Board of Trustees in 2008, the University Park Campus Master Plan is a commendable step toward affirming USC’s dedication to the surrounding neighborhoods of South Los Angeles and USC’s community organizations while continuing to serve the evolving needs of the student body.
According to the proposal, the 20-year Master Plan set forth by former USC President Steven B. Sample seeks “to promote integration and connectivity between the University Park Campus and the surrounding urban community.” Improvements and construction will concentrate on academics, housing, open space, athletics, administrative support, transportation and parking.
The key focus for the Master Plan centers on redeveloping the the University Village into a more modernized and student-friendly hub of residential buildings and tailored retail stores. As USC’s student demographic shifts, efforts are underway to guarantee four years of university-sponsored housing for undergraduates and one for graduate students, an endeavor that requires the addition of 7,600 new beds.
Most of the renovation will occur on Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street, with more than 2.5 million square feet of academic and university space slated to be added. The new $130-million Ronald Tutor Campus Center only marks the beginning of an ambitious goal to restructure the university while maintaining respect for both the school’s history, tradition and partnership with the community.
Beginning in 2012, expect District 3, the area around the University Village, to undergo renovation that will add new housing complexes for 5,200 more student beds, a new grocery store, restaurants, a fitness center, a 2,000-seat movie theater, a bookstore and a hotel. The current University Village, Cardinal Gardens, Century and La Sorbornne apartments will also be replaced or expanded in the process.
To improve the flow of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic, sections of McClintock Avenue will be converted to pedestrian- and bicycle-only streets with narrower walkways and more open, park-like greenery and streetscapes.
In this sense, the Master Plan adheres to the five principles of USC’s neighborhood engagement efforts: “great schools, safe streets, good jobs, home ownership and respectful partnerships.”
The Master Plan emerged partly in response to the gradual displacement of community members by students seeking housing, which has stirred some controversy. Individuals also expressed reservations about high-end retailers displacing cheaper options such as Dollar Dollar and Superior Grocers while simultaneously drawing customers away from local businesses.
But USC and the surrounding area are interdependent. The new University Village needs local patronage to survive, and USC’s entrance brings myriad social and economic benefits, especially considering the university is the largest private employer in the City of Los Angeles.
The university has already held more than 75 meetings since the initial motion, discussions to address the community’s concerns, open forums and presentations on campus to encourage student input. A Master Plan Advisory Committee with representatives from neighborhood organizations, churches and other groups guided the proposal so it reasonably satisfied everyone involved.
The resulting product will offer benefits from every perspective. Students will receive more conveniently located housing, a revitalized modern commercial complex in place of the University Village, and expanded academic buildings. The community will receive an influx of business and economic benefits that have become so vital in recent times of economic hardship.
With the Master Plan, USC seeks to cultivate the surrounding close-knit community and central park-like atmosphere and facilities of a small college town in South Los Angeles, accurately anticipating the needs of USC — and the community — for years to come.

Few universities in the country maintain as large of a community presence as USC does in South Los Angeles. With its 300-acre University Park Campus located in the heart of a bustling Downtown, its physical presence alone is enough to warrant attention, along with its attempts to act as a good neighbor to the surrounding communities.

Currently, USC is undergoing a planned transformation from the largely commuter school that it once was to a truly residential university. At the center of this change is the University Park Campus Master Plan, a 20-year outline of redevelopment and expansion for the university approved in 2008 under the direction of former President Steven B. Sample.
According to Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president for university real estate and assessment management, the plan was created to ensure the physical growth of the university while accommodating the needs of the University Park community.
“The city asked us to provide a Master Plan to illustrate our planned growth for the next 20 years,” Raspe said. “We agreed that it was important for us to articulate our plan for the city and the surrounding community, as well as the students, faculty and staff.”
Included in the Master Plan is the construction of on-campus facilities such as the recently announced $70-million athletic facility that will be built on the site of the current intramural field.
An issue of greater contention for USC’s community, however, is the planned construction in what is known as Master Planning District 3, which consists of the area including University Village, Cardinal Gardens and Century Apartments.
“It was important to the community that we preserve a retail presence in that area,” Raspe said. “There was also a sense that students’ demand for housing was overrunning the neighborhood and displacing local residents, so the No. 1 issue that was raised by the community was the need for student housing.”
When USC began formulating ideas for the current Master Plan in 2006, university officials held several meetings with members of the community to include their input in the plans. Many neighbors expressed concern that the planned renovation of the University Village — an estimated $900-million undertaking that will produce graduate and undergraduate student housing, faculty offices, a new movie theater, stores and a parking garage — would be too upscale for the area. USC officials, however, have stressed that the new University Village will serve students as well as the community.

“Based upon the market analysis we’ve done, the new Village will not survive or be financially viable if at least 50 percent of our shoppers don’t come from the community,” Raspe said. “We are completely incentivized to fill the retail shops with retailers that are attractive to both the students and the neighbors from the local community.”
“The price point for the students very much overlaps the price point for the community,” she added.
“A lot of people think all of our students are high-end shopping, wealthy individuals, when in fact over 60 percent of our students are on some form of financial aid and very much enjoy shopping at places that are fiscally appropriate for community shoppers as well.”
In addition to worries of unaffordable retail overtaking the area, some local residents also feared that university expansion would encroach on the community.
“People are always worried about things like displacement, although a lot of it is based in past history and old fears,” said Shawn Simons, president of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council, an organization dedicated to involving local residents with development in the area. “With the Master Plan, USC doesn’t have plans to build on anything that isn’t already USC property, and that’s something that isn’t clear to a lot of people within the community.”
Redevelopment in the area stands to provide several benefits to the community, Simons said, and local residents are starting to become aware of those possibilities.
“The community was more focused on negatives that might happen rather than looking at the positives that it might bring,” Simons said. “Part of what NANDC has been doing is talking about the community benefits package and helping the community to have input on the massive amounts of money and infrastructure and jobs that this project can bring into our community.”
As the largest private employer in the City of Los Angeles, USC already brings a large amount of revenue to its community, whether through local hiring initiatives or attracting customers to local businesses. With the planned redevelopments, the local economy could be jumpstarted at a much-needed time.

“USC is a huge economic factor,” said Chris Pearson, policy director with the South L.A. Initiatives Program in the Mayor’s Office of Economic and Business Policy. “The biggest thing they have to embrace is providing the opportunity for the community members around them to benefit from the developments that are going to be happening in the coming years.”
Economic concerns have fueled much of the debate surrounding redevelopment in the area.
According to Eddie North-Hager, the USC staff representative on the NANDC, most of the issues brought up at the council’s community meetings revolve around these economic concerns, and most residents would welcome anything that improves their situations.
“Everybody’s a little bit worried about the future right now, in small ways and big ways,” he said. “It’s hard on this community, just like it is for everyone, but it was probably already harder on this community than it is in most places.”
The possibility of an economic rebirth being assisted by the university’s developments in the area embodies the Master Plan’s goal of improving the community while also expanding the university.
With such a possibility on the horizon, local opinion regarding the Master Plan has begun to change course from concern to optimism.
“This could bring an enormous amount of jobs to our community, a community that right now that has a median income of $26,000 a year,” Simons said. “If we’re able to bring real jobs to this community and our median income is able to go up by $10,000, that’s a huge change for our community.”
A major proponent of stimulating the economy within the community surrounding USC has been President C. L. Max Nikias, who has said he intends to create an initiative to help generate job growth in the area this spring.
Nikias also has other plans for the community. He’ has expressed interest in bringing free high-speed Internet to the 100 homes closest to campus and providing additional support to the schools USC partners with.
“We live in a community, and we live for a community,” Nikias said in a Nov. 9 discussion with students.
Though many local residents have sometimes expressed frustration with living in such close proximity to college students, they have also acknowledged that USC has always been a benefit to the community at large and will continue to be in the future.
“The school has to expand, and I think that they’re doing it responsibly,” said David Martinez, a resident who lives among student housing on 29th Street. “The community has to adapt to the school, just as the school has to adapt to the community. It’s a two-way street.”
Simons agreed that the community and the university will have to work together and reconcile their differences in order for legitimate improvement to come to the neighborhood.
“It’s important that the community continues to get involved and make their voices heard in terms of what’s important to them,” Simons said. “Change is definitely going to come, but we have an opportunity to focus the change.”
Until such change does manifest itself in South Los Angeles, students, faculty and community members alike will all have to focus on living together in the current situation. As USC continues with its Master Plan, officials said the community is sure to play a large role.
“Even in the current University Village, as much as it’s a product of the 1960s, students who go to USC, students who go to local high schools, and moms and dads who use the grocery store all come here and they eat together,” North-Hager said. “That’s the perfect picture of coexisting in the community.”
Yes, of course the university is partners with the city and most importantly with our surrounding community–I don’t think any school does more for its community than USC does. Both benefit immensley from this symbiosis.
At the same time, the present administation has an OBLIGATION to the present and to the future trojan community to secure physical space north of Jefferson, above and beyond the present land owned by the university, in order to provide for growth over the coming decades. One hundred years from now, the campus will surely look much different, aside from our UPC core campus, than it does today. Specifically, the only sensible area for physical expansion is into the area between Hoover and Figueroa and Adams and Jefferson. USC will undeniabley require sites for future buildings and athletic fields to service its 35,000 strong student population. It would be negligant not the plan for growth beyond the warren that will soon be University Village/Century/Cardinal Gardens. Letting outside developers like University Gateway determine the economies of USC makes no sense–this is the universities responsibility.
