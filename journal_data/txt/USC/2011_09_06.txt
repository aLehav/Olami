It was almost effortless.
With the No. 9 USC women’s volleyball team’s Pac-12 opener against No. 8 UCLA a mere three days away, it looked more than ready to face off against the Bruins, as it routed Cal State Northridge on Tuesday in straight sets — the final game of the team’s nonconference slate.

“We’re lucky we got out of there in three,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It was good to see[freshman setter/opposite] Emily [Young] with an excellent performance [at the end of game two] and we’re hoping she keeps coming since she’s got such great potential.
Despite an upset loss to Central Florida on Friday, the straight-set victory over the Matadors propelled the Women of Troy (5-2) to their fourth consecutive win. It also marked the 12th consecutive set the team had won — its fourth straight sweep.
Even with pre-game temperatures nearing 102 degrees as a result of no air conditioning at the Matadome in Northridge, Calif., USC got off to a hot start, grabbing an early 14-4 lead in the first set behind strong play from senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who led the Women of Troy with a team-high 13 kills.
While eventually winning the set 25-16, Jupiter and company ran into a bit of a dry spell in the second frame, leading just 15-13 midway through the set. The Women of Troy, however, went on a late 8-3 run to make it 23-16 in the waning moments. Eventually, they closed the set after freshman setter/opposite Emily Young posted back-to-back kills.
“We need to figure out how we are going to score more points because that seems to be the problem lately,” Haley said. “We need good production out of Kirby. Alex [Jupiter] has been great, while [junior outside hitter/opposite] Katie Fuller has been hot and cold.”
Holding a decisive 2-0 lead, USC struggled at times during the final set, as Cal State Northridge was able to grab a 18-17 lead.
Jupiter knotted the score at 18 with another kill.
USC eventually closed out the set, 25-21 following kills from Fuller and freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer. The duo also finished with a total of 14 kills — seven each.
USC will open Pac-12 play on Friday against UCLA at Galen Center.
The Bruins remain undefeated, while USC has fallen twice this season — to then-No. 1 Penn State and Central Florida.
“I don’t think either team is playing the way their coaches want,” Haley said. “But I think if we can get our legs back, all this traveling to the East Coast has taken a toll, and we can get rested by Friday we can deliver a good game.”
As it hosts crosstown rival UCLA in what will be the first ever Pac-12 women’s volleyball game for both programs, the Women of Troy will attempt to break the school’s all-time attendance mark.
“I think people are going to have to get there early, because what I hear from the ticket office it is going to be packed,” Haley said.

At approximately 4:37 p.m. Saturday, either USC placekicker Andre Heidari or his Utah counterpart Nick Marsh will send a commemorative football soaring high into the late afternoon Los Angeles sky, officially beginning the first game in Pac-12 history.
By that time, however, the Pac-12 might already be a thing of the past.
Rumors are swirling that Texas and Oklahoma, along with Texas Tech and Oklahoma State, could be heading west to form the nation’s first super-conference.
University of Oklahoma President David Boren stirred the conference realignment pot again this weekend.
“I don’t think OU is going to be a wallflower when all is said and done,” he said before reports surfaced that Oklahoma and Texas officials have been talking with Pac-12 brass about joining the league.
Boren was reacting to Texas A&M’s announcement last week that it’s leaving the Big 12 contingent upon acceptance into another conference, which threatened to start a domino effect that could reorganize major college football into four, 16-team leagues.
The already numerically confused Big 12 is expected to be left with nine teams going forward and is seemingly being held together by a mixture of Scotch tape and the romances of what college football tradition once was.
The possible addition of Oklahoma and Texas, two of the sport’s most storied programs with 11 national titles and seven Heisman trophies among them, would certainly boost the Pac-whatever’s profile.
Oklahoma State and Texas Tech are no slouches, having both been ranked in the nation’s top five at one point in the last four seasons.
The added star power and depth of the new Pac-16 would turn the conference into the premier league in college football.
But would it be a good thing for USC?
Just a few years ago, the answer would have been a resounding yes.
Back then, things were much simpler in the land of Troy. USC owned college football in the Pacific time zone, winning at least a share of seven straight conference championships between 2002 and 2008. The Trojans’ 38 Pac-10 titles, more than double any other school’s total (UCLA is second with 17), and their 33 Rose Bowl appearances are far and away the conference’s most (Washington is second with 14).
Only three years ago, USC’s biggest hurdle was its in-conference schedule strength. The Trojans missed out on playing for the BCS title in 2007 and 2008, despite finishing the season with the same amount of losses as the eventual national champions.
Fans and media reasoned the Trojans really needed a college football playoff to just prove it was just as good as LSU and Florida, which won the BCS title those seasons. On the biggest stage under the brightest lights, no one could compete with USC’s NFL-factory talent. It was just those darn Beavers, Bruins and Cardinals that would unexpectedly trip up USC each year, preventing another national title trophy from being dollied into the Heritage Hall lobby.
The situation now, however, is different.
The West Coast college football power began to change hands even before the conference plates began shifting during summer 2010.
The NCAA effectively sanctioned USC out of national title contention for at least the better part of five years (and quite possibly longer) with a postseason ban and scholarship reductions.
Oregon’s historically average football program was transformed into a neon juggernaut by a combination of Phil Knight’s Nike money and Chip Kelly’s spread offense.
Utah’s rise as a BCS-buster and its subsequent move to the Pac-12 has added another nationally respected opponent to USC’s yearly schedule.
It’s unlikely the Trojans will ever again win seven straight conference titles playing in a league with Oregon, Texas, Oklahoma, Stanford and Utah.
USC’s goal would go from dominating rivals to earn points with voters to being the last team standing in a Pac-16 battle royal that would even outstrip what goes on each fall in the SEC.
The decision on whether to expand the conference will not ultimately be about what is best for USC’s national championship hopes. Like most decisions in college football these days, it will be about money.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has proven he has a strong business sense by bringing in more than a few dollars into the conference’s coffers. The 12-year, $3-billion television rights deal Scott signed with ESPN and Fox made the Trojans (along with every other school in the conference) a whole lot richer.
The main hurdle to this deal is Texas’ ownership of the Longhorn Network, to which ESPN will pay $300 million for 20 years. The first network dedicated solely to one school’s athletic program, Texas’ revenue advantage over other Big-12 schools is one of the principal reasons Texas A&M wants out.
Scott would need a way in which Texas could keep its network without angering the current Pac-12 schools, all of which share TV money equally.
The bottom line is that USC is never going to back down from a challenge — that attitude is not in the nature of the football program or the fans that support it.
One thing is certain: If the Pac-16 comes to fruition, college football will never be the same. For a program that has dominated the sport for decades out west, that change might not work in USC’s favor.

This article makes it sound as if the Trojan nation is a bit scared of some real competition.  As an OU fan and alumni I hate to see the big12 dissolve, it has arguably been the second best conference of the BCS era.  However, I am stoked about the concept of the PAC-16.  It would clearly be the best conference between having 4 big-gun teams in OU, Texas, USC and Oregon, not to mention the loads of mid-level talent.  Plus it would be nice to go to the Rose bowl every year instead of the fiesta
I like it, bring on those Longhorns
Great article.  I’m a Utah alumna living in Texas, and for those very selfish reasons I want the Pac-12 to add UT and OU.  Here’s how I see for a guarantee that the Pac-16 always sends a team to the national title game:  four four-team divisions, a semi-final round, and a conference championship.  Here is how USC’s schedule would look:
Years 1 & 3:
Oregon
Oregon State
Arizona
Arizona State
Oklahoma
Oklahoma State
Stanford
Cal
UCLA
(semi-final)
(final)
(bowl)
And years 2 & 4:
Washington
Washington State
Utah
Colorado
Texas
Texas Tech
Stanford
Cal
UCLA
(semi-final)
(final)
(bowl)
This system allows USC to play every opponent every-other year, while playing the other California schools every year.  Likewise, every Pac-16 team would visit the state of California every year (important for recruiting).  USC would go to the state of Texas every-other year, but during the off years, they would still be visiting the state of Oklahoma.  This means two visits to the Central Time Zone and two to the Mountain Time Zone every year.  
The hang-up, if there is one, is in getting permission for two semi-final games.  But if it could be done, then two of the four rounds required for a sixteen-team playoff are accomplished during the regular conference season.  If the SEC were to adopt the same format, we would quickly find ourselves with four sixteen-team conferences.
… and USC, like 63 other teams, would find itself with a clear, known path to the national title.  For USC:  win its four-team division, and then win four games.

Senior tailback Marc Tyler is officially back.
In anticipation for the inaugural Pac-12 game against Utah, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Tyler will be on the field Saturday against the Utes.
“Yes, he will be playing,” Kiffin said. “I don’t know how much [though].”
Back in action · Senior tailback Marc Tyler, pictured here on Oct. 16 against California, will play in the Trojans’ Pac-12 opener against Utah on Saturday at the Coliseum. As a junior last season, Tyler ran for 913 yards and nine touchdowns. - Daily Trojan file photo
Tyler was previously serving a suspension from all team activities following his conduct on a video posted on the TMZ website. Tyler has been working with the scout team for the past several weeks.
“We had a number of things he had to do and he did all those things,” Kiffin said.  “He’s looking very good … there’s still a lot of work to do but it’s great to have him.”
The return of Tyler, however, gives USC another player in an already crowded backfield that includes junior Curtis McNeal, sophomore Dillon Baxter, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan and freshman Amir Carlisle.
Of those four, only Morgan and McNeal logged carries in Saturday’s home opener against Minnesota, while Baxter had one reception for three yards. Baxter’s lack of playing time led to a meeting with Kiffin following the game.
“I need to work hard every day and work harder than everybody else,” Baxter said. “I thought I didn’t go as hard as I could last week and that is what coach let me know. I just want to know what I can do to get better.”
—
Despite scoring 19 points in the first half against the Golden Gophers, the USC offense was shut out in the second half.
“Basically, it was two different halves,” Kiffin said. “The first half, we scored three touchdowns, special teams played good, very few penalties … that’s how we expect to play. The second half was very disappointing.”
The Trojan offense was also visibly frustrated with its lack of scoring in Saturday’s game.
“As an offense, we are looking to score every drive,” junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil said. “We strive for perfection. Any slight off of that, we’re upset with ourselves.”
Senior linebacker Chris Galippo echoed similar sentiments in regard to the defense, although he feels the team will be more prepared this week because of its familiarity with former offensive coordinator Norm Chow.
“We had an idea on what they were going to run, but we didn’t know exactly,” Galippo said. “The team feels more confident going into the second week of the season. We know coach Chow. Our coach knows him very well. I think it will just be a different week.”
—
One question mark going into the season opener was the play of the offensive line. On Saturday, however, they did not give up any sacks. Despite the unit’s play, Kalil understands Utah’s defensive line will challenge the Trojans up front.
“They’re a lot bigger, they’re really big up front,” Kalil said. “We need to be more aggressive. We can’t be as passive as we were [against Minnesota]. This is a lot bigger, faster, better team that we are playing.”
Despite Utah struggling to win against Football Championship Subdivision-school Montana State, Kiffin expects a tough game.
“This is a good team,” Kiffin said. “They’ve played in big games. They’re not going to be intimidated by playing USC or in the Coliseum.”
—
The Trojans did not add any to the injury list after the season opener.
“Not having to deal with injuries, allows us to go back and work on all the little kinks,” Kiffin said.

Monday’s All Hail A Capella event had a lot to sing about.
Seven of USC’s a cappella choirs showcased their talents in a long night filled with triumph, beauty and soul.
Vocal chords · USC’s Reverse Osmosis hit the stage with a medley of Mumford and Sons and joined forces with other talented Trojans, including Asli Baat, Khoir Practice, Troy Tones, SoCal VoCals, The Sirens and The Trojan Men. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
Asli Baat, a group of South Asian fusion singers opened the show and  served as a welcome detour from  traditional a cappella. The group stunned the audience with a mixture of haunting South Asian lyrics and decent execution of more contemporary pop hits.
Beautiful voices, however, could not hide juvenile choreography. The singers were awkward with their movements and seemed less than assured.
Asli Baat’s vocal stylings were lackluster in a few numbers. Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles” and Jay-Z and Alicia Keys’ “Empire State of Mind” could have burned down the house, but sloppy vocal execution made these songs fall short.
With its beautiful harmonies, Asli Baat’s rendition of “Love the Way You Lie” by Eminem and Rihanna was the best of the set. The surprising foray into rap impressed and excited the audience, which finally elicited the singers’ confidence.
Khoir Practice was one of the night’s pleasant surprises. After a less than impressive showing at last year’s Absolut A Cappella, Khoir Practice sang almost perfect versions of The Wings’ “Maybe I’m Amazed,” Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn” and Maroon 5’s “Misery.”
The group’s lead soloist was brilliantly on pitch during the performance of “Maybe I’m Amazed.” The choreography, however, was generally static and the group could have had a more commanding attitude while performing.
Masters of stage presence, the members of Troy Tones were spirited as they sported outlandish outfits inspired by Katy Perry’s “T.G.I.F. (Last Friday Night)” video. Their vocals weren’t too shabby either.
Troy Tones junior Allison Robbins left the audience in awe as she belted out “Cowboy Casanova” by Carrie Underwood. Additionally, the Troy Tones’ rendition of Duffy’s “Mercy” felt fresh and inventive.
The Troy Tones ended their set with a beautiful cover of “Circle of Life” from The Lion King, showcasing impeccable vocals and intoxicatingly fun choreography.
More subdued than the Troy Tones was one of USC’s mos known a cappella groups, Reverse Osmosis. Beginning with a medley of Mumford and Sons tunes, Reverse Osmosis epitomized the utilization of the voice as an instrument.
What seems like the 1000th cover of Coldplay’s “Fix You” found an eerie presence in the group’s sublime execution, illustrating that complicated choreography is unnecessary if the voice itself is exceptional. As for their finale, “Find My Way Home” by the Gabe Dixon Band was sexy and seductive while serving as a good cap to their set.
USC’s other perennial favorite, SoCal VoCals, showcased its personality in Beyonce’s “Best Thing I Never Had.” SoCal VoCals’ soloist had more attitude than Sasha Fierce. The group’s covers of “Hold my Heart” and USC’s “Alma Mater” were not quite as memorable, but in SoCal VoCal style, they were delivered in top-notch pitch.
The Sirens, USC’s all-female troupe, performed commendably, but the ladies missed their mark on each of their numbers. Sara Bareilles’ “King of Anything” was sweet but not special, while the soloist in a cover of Adele’s “Turning Tables” completely ignored the heartbreak and pain Adele puts into each word, barely skimming the surface of the vocal power necessary to cover such a masterpiece.
Mariah Carey’s “Always Be My Baby” was the best out of the three as the soloist showed the most personality, but as a whole, the group sounded hollow when compared to the rest of the performers.
The night ended on a high note with a powerhouse performance by the event’s hosts, The Trojan Men. USC’s a cappella’s heartthrobs worked the stage into frenzy with “Hard to Handle,” “Lullaby,” “It’s a Man’s World” and “Vehicle.”
The vulnerable yet strong vocals in “Lullaby” were breathtaking and emotional. “It’s a Man’s World,” on the other hand, was a fun end to the evening, infused with soul and depth, which other acts were lacking.
Auditions for USC’s a cappella groups will take place Sept. 7 and 8 at 8 p.m. in Taper Hall. Open auditions for Asli Baat will take place on Sept. 6-8 at 6:30 p.m.

After its eighth year, FYF Fest proved itself as one of the season’s biggest and most impressive music festivals.
This year, FYF grew in size and resources so it offered more helpful amenities — like food trucks, water fountains and staff — and featured a lineup that is thought to be one of the festival’s best to date.
FYF Fest has previously featured up-and-coming and under-the-radar bands like Panda Bear and Best Coast. But this year the festival took quite a turn in putting alternative rock superstars Cold War Kids, Broken Social Scene, Explosions in the Sky and Guided by Voice in the lineup. And the abundance of resources offered to help with the expected throngs of people meant less time standing in line for tickets and more time frolicking in the beer gardens and listening to some good music.
Here are a few highlights from the 12-hour festival:
Chromatics
Under the shade of a tent in the “Splinter’s Den,” Chromatics created a magical ambience with blasé riffs and airy vocals. For a band made up of only three members playing chilled-out tracks, its songs were catchy enough to draw in a surprisingly large crowd.
Cold War Kids
Cold War Kids hit the stage running, serving up energetic beats and powerful vocals. Have you ever been to a concert where the songs sound disappointingly different than they did on the album? This wasn’t the case with Cold War Kids. If anything, their onstage sound was even more vibrant than it has been on their albums.
They played hits such as “Saint John” from their breakout album “Robbers & Cowards,” and newer songs from their most recent album “Mine Is Yours,” giving each song an equal amount of strength and precision.
No Age
No Age was quite a detour after seeing Cold War Kids. Though its sound was a little mushier than Cold War Kids — probably because of the stage and acoustics — its punk rock energy was a reminder of the festival’s origins. Though there wasn’t too much strange, out-of-control festival behavior at FYF, during No Age’s set two teenagers drew attention when they tied themselves together with Saran wrap. But for the most part, the crowd was calm and perhaps even a little unenthusiastic, while watching members of the lively No Age rock their hearts out.
Broken Social Scene
Broken Social Scene made for a beautiful 7 p.m. slot. With its poppy sound and magical instrumentals, the band made for a captivating performance as it played hits like “7/4 (Shoreline)” and other nostalgically upbeat tracks. Because the main stage was conveniently located next to the beer garden, listeners could grab hot dogs and drinks while still watching the band play its dreamy vocals and pretty trumpet solos.
Guided by Voices
It was dark by the time Guided by Voices came on, and in true rock star fashion, each member had a cigarette dangling from his mouth as the band emphatically hit the stage with a vibrant sound that was viciously energetic and tightly rehearsed. The band’s ability to rock hard without sounding muddled or messy was reiterated by Robert Pollard, who introduced the band as a “professional traveling rock ‘n’ roll band.” Because Guided by Voices has so many one- and two-minute songs, the band was able to play several tracks like “Bee Thousand” and “Alien Lanes.” Among the most entertaining songs were the dark, bluesy “Hot Freaks,” the catchy “Game of Pricks” and the famous, lo-fi hit “I Am a Scientist.”
 
The late-night hours were filled with high-energy bands that ranged from punk rockers Descendants to smooth dance jammers Simian Mobile Disco. Death From Above 1979, who went on hiatus in 2006, played the late-night 11 p.m. slot; and though it is five years later, the band still retains the dark dance feel that made it so popular around 2005.

It’s no secret that Nintendo has had some problems these past few years.
Lately, the company has been garnering more ridicule than it has praise. We constantly hear about the Wii’s pitfalls — how its graphics lack detail, how its games are generic and lackluster and how its target audience is the casual, noncommittal gamer. Evidently, Nintendo has fallen behind in creative and technological innovation.
Now, however, Nintendo is attempting to pull themselves back into the competition with their latest console, the Wii U.
Announced June 7, the Wii U will be a direct successor to the Wii, making it Nintendo’s sixth home video game console. The company’s newest creation will hit stores sometime next year at a soon-to-be-announced retail price.
In theory, the system sounds relatively ideal. The Wii U is the first Nintendo console to allow 1080p resolution, which effectively places it on equal footing with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles. It also flaunts backwards compatibility — the ability to play old Wii games and use old Wii accessories — with all Wii games and Wii console accessories.
One of the biggest draws — and also, complaints — is the massive, 6.2-inch touch-screen controller, which dually functions as a second perspective during gameplay and a limited portable console. In other words, you can use the controller’s touch screen to play a Wii U game without having to turn on your main television set.
With an array of appealing features, you’d think the system would be the talk of the town. So, then, why are so many people bashing the Wii U?
Since the release of the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 consoles in 2005 and 2006, most hardcore gamers have demonstrated allegiance to Sony and Microsoft, primarily because of the Wii’s childish style, inferior graphics and online capability. Therefore, to a large number of gamers, the Wii U is simply an overdue and unnecessary attempt to compete with the familiar and reliable Xbox 360 and  PlayStation 3 consoles.
It’s also difficult to give the Wii U a chance given its price tag. If Nintendo’s 3DS and Wii offer any grounds for comparison, the Wii U will most likely enter the market at a much higher rate — probably anywhere from $300 to $400. A high price alone is enough to sway any hesitant purchaser away from the newest addition to the Nintendo family.
But Nintendo might be able to negate any problems with the Wii U via a new generation of games. One of the system’s few silver linings is its potential for a remarkably versatile game selection. Nintendo announced plans for the newest installment in the Super Smash Bros. series to be included in the Wii U’s list of titles along with Super Mario Bros. Mii and Pikmin 3.
Other popular, non-Nintendo games, such as Rocksteady Studios’ Batman: Arkham City, are also slated for release on the Wii U. Such third-party games could entice hardcore gamers back to the Nintendo field and promote a more positive opinion of the company once more.
But one problem is inevitable: The PlayStation Vita, Sony’s successor to the PlayStation Portable, is also due for a 2012 release. Following its release, Sony’s portable device will certainly steal some of the limelight away from Nintendo’s novel creation.
According to a poll by Japanese gaming publication Famitsu, 87 percent of Japanese gamers are interested in buying a Vita, whereas only 38.3 percent of gamers expressed interest in purchasing a Wii U.
The findings are not terribly surprising. The Vita is like the Wii U controller with a basic touch screen and high-definition graphics. But games can be played virtually anywhere online, and the Vita’s starting price is a very reasonable $250. And, for just $50 more, the portable game system includes 3G capability, a feature the Wii U lacks.
The Vita is pretty much everything the Wii U should be — a sleek, sophisticated handheld device. Nintendo, however, opted for a home video game console when it should have created an innovative, transitional piece of technology that has all the features of a home console plus more.
Even with some interesting attributes and a possibly impressive game selection, the Wii U just doesn’t hold much promise on its own, particularly in battle against the Vita. Nintendo is trying its hardest to return to its glory days, but this next step just isn’t in the right direction.
Though the company is by no means a failure, Nintendo needs to take a few hints from Sony and Microsoft if it ever seriously hopes to get back in the game.
 
Hannah Muniz is a junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures and English. Her column “Game Over” runs Wednesdays.
Seriously, the ONLY way Nintendo can fully regain its lost ground is to appeal to the hardcore gamers that it obviously neglected with the release of the Wii.  I hold great respect for Nintendo, especially as an avid Zelda fan, but their showings these past five years have been pitiful from the eyes of a “non-casual” gamer such as myself.
I have a few things to say here, to start off the vita is not competing with the wii u, its competing with the 3DS, and really ”Nintendo needs to take a few hints from Sony and Microsoft if it ever seriously hopes to get back in the game.”
Nintendo beat them both in this gen, the only reason the ps3 and Xbox have stayed in the game this long is because they stole ideas from Nintendo, Sony stole the d-pad, the portable, analog sticks, the wii mote, shoulder pads, touch screen on a handheld, and rumble. microsoft got the idea of the avatar from the mii, and the idea of kinect from U-force,
i think nintendo will do great. all consoles from the past were great. they may LOOK childish but the way they work is just amazing for adults as well. so good luck nintendo :)
Nintendo need to take hints from Sony oir Microsoft if they’re to stay in the game?!!  Seriously, where on Earth did this writer come from?  The Wii sold more than the 360 and the PS3.  Just because it’s slowing down, where does this make it a failure, or place Nintendo in the $hit pit?  I’ve noticed how Sony and Microsoft both take hints from Nintendo and copy them!  Also, The Wii controller comes with the system.  The Vita and PS3 are 2 systems.  The Wii U is more powerful than both the 360 and PS3, so it really should not suffer from ports and the very fact 1080p is rarely featured in the 360/PS3 games also means it’s superior and in TRUE HD.  Good night from my rant of haste!  gah.
Where did I come from?  My writing is worse!!!  hehe.
you getting it all wrong vita is not wii u’s competttor its the 3ds wii u has the next xbox n playstation to worry about.one last thing nintendo are still living their glory days does wii ring a bell hell yea it still selling like hotdogs even hthough not like it used it.
I suppose if you have a ps3 then a Vita would be the way to go. Assuming the WiiU was 250 bucks. You could theoretically get that tablet experience with the handheld on the system you already own.
Potential problem? How PS3 handled motion control in their sixaxis controllers. I’m saying that this tacked on experience is replicating another system that made said experience its core. Even if it can compare it won’t compete as well.
The real question is does grand turismo allow for sixaxis motion control now? Their past gimick tech has been washed away by newer tech. I wouldn’t be surprised if the tablet attributes of vita get replaced by “playstation certified” tablets.
It’s not exactly fair to make unverified (and indeed, unverifiable) general public feeling and a Japanese poll your main sources when talking about the possible success or failure of the Wii U as compared to the Vita worldwide. Of course interest in the successor to the PSP is high in Japan. The PSP outsold the Wii in the land of the rising sun (by a margin of 50% of the Wii’s total sales no less), which is not true of any other region. I’m not saying that the Wii U will be the runaway success that its predecessor was, nor that Vita couldn’t very well trounce it this gen (as much as the markets for handhelds and consoles cross over, which is truthfully not much); but to take a Famitsu poll and extrapolate those results as an indicator of the console’s future success in all territories is poor journalism, even in a college publication, and smacks of a writer who isn’t very familiar with the video games business.
Muniz should be comparing the possible success of the PSVita to that of the 3DS as they are actually in the same market. There’s plenty of juicy Nintendo-bashing material there. Or, if she wants to talk home consoles and compare the functionality of the Wii U to that of the PS3 + PSVita (not taking into account the limited support that non-standard control options receive) then she should also be comparing the price of Nintendo’s next console to that of both Sony platforms combined, which exceeds even her projected price of the Wii U by a wide margin. Running games NATIVELY in 1080p would put the console head and shoulders above its “HD” competitors in the graphics department, not on equal footing. Finally, why the hell would Nintendo need to take hints from the competitors that it absolutely trounced this generation on both the handheld and console fronts? Return to the glory days? By whose reckoning?
All in all, a poor column. The author takes into account only those facts that suit her argument. Sadly, this puts Muniz at par with most of the spin-happy media channels out there. Sad day.
This article is written by a stupid person, yes I used the word stupid. 
At first I was like… Oh ok that is a fact but when this idiot started comparing with the vita, I wish I would go to him or her and strangle him or her so hard. I thought only poor minded fanboys would do that. I mean come on, a HOME CONSOLE NEEDS 3G. You know how ridiculous that is?
Real gamers are smart enough to tell who is trying to show off ( that’s the case with idiot up there) and who is passionate about it. GAMERS DON’T COME HERE.GO TO A MORE RELIABLE SOURCE LIKE IGN, KOTAKU or something like that. NOT SOME WEBSITE THAT WAS NAMED BY A VIRUS
My village is no longer missing its idiot.  Time for your medication, Mr. Ravyu.
vita will never take away or outsell the wiiu now that dragon quest X has been announced for the wiiU say goodbye to vita sales japan will want wiiU DQX

Today marks what would have been the 75th birthday of Buddy Holly, the world-renowned singer-songwriter and producer who passed away far too soon, in a 1959 plane crash at 22. In honor of his numerous milestones — including a flurry of hit singles as a solo artist and as the front man of The Crickets, the entire music community recognizes the cultural significance and incredible talent of one of America’s most beloved entertainers.
Pop icon · The infamous Buddy Holly endures eternally in Hollywood and the music world as a pioneer of pop music, composition and songwriting. - Photo courtesy of Universal Music Group
Holly will be remembered by his widow, Maria Elena, and Peter Asher, of the famed duo Peter and Gordon, as his star on Hollywood Boulevard will be revealed. To further commemorate Holly’s memory, Verve Forecast has put out a tribute album, Listen to Me: Buddy Holly, an album that features a star-studded array of artists reinterpreting some of Buddy Holly’s most famous hits, such as “Peggy Sue” and “Take Your Time.”
Asher, the album’s executive producer, said he believes the new album celebrates the legacy of a man who had forever changed the music industry in both content and style.
“Well, you know, I don’t think I was right on Buddy Holly from the beginning,” Asher said, regarding Holly’s breakout onto the world stage. “I believe I was introduced to Buddy by my partner at the time, Gordon. He knew all the Buddy Holly songs. They were quite simple songs, using chords that we could easily play, and yet they were just tremendously great, catchy, harmonic songs!”
The music is, after all, what continues to make Holly an influential figure today.
“I think it’s still all about the music. Just like Mozart — what made Mozart famous was his music and then, nonetheless, you start looking at him after his life and find out that he was an incredibly interesting guy,” Asher said.
Asher also recognized that Holly embodied more than his music.
“He was clearly very smart. He had a nerdishness about him,” Asher said. “In fact, he was significant culturally to us, specifically to me, because he showed that you didn’t have to be tall, dark, and handsome — an Elvis type — to be a pop star.”
Holly’s less-than-glamorous image was undoubtedly a part of his universal appeal. As a self-proclaimed “white, nerdy type,” Asher admitted, “It was great for me to have someone to say ‘Look! Buddy Holly did it, so can I!’”
Beyond his noticeable cultural influences, it is important to consider all Holly could have been.
“He took his career seriously,” Asher said. “It was a shame — had he not died he would have been one of those people who wouldn’t have gone on to be a rock ‘n’ roll casualty. He was the kind of guy who would have gone on to producing records and starting a new label and all kinds of stuff that we’ll never know.”
But dwelling on what could have been is not what the celebration is about.
“I think he’s important for how much he did do in a terribly short time,” Asher said.
Asher is not the only Holly enthusiast; the 16 artists who are a part of Listen To Me are as well. Many were asked to be on the record, but Asher said some “didn’t care about Buddy Holly in the first place and then some people just jumped at it!”
Those who took on the project would typically express song preference themselves, but Asher had a hand in the process from time to time.
“Very often it was me trying to cast it,” Asher said. “In the case of The Fray, a band I love, they didn’t quite see how they were going to do a Buddy Holly song and I gave them a sort of treatment saying here’s the kind of song and here’s the feeling I think you should do it.”
Listen To Me: Buddy Holly is available now.  Pick up a copy to hear some of your favorite artists’ interpretations of some classic tunes.

Shark Night is about a group of college students who take a breather from classes at a picturesque lake, only to discover the lake is full of deadly sharks. It’s a simple (and fairly crass) premise, and there is ultimately a reason for the setting to be a lake rather than an ocean. That being said, it’s never justified, nor does it ever seem any more logical than it first appears.

This is the latest film from David R. Ellis, who helmed such notorious, critical pariahs as Snakes on a Plane and Final Destination 2. As with his other works, Ellis imbues this film with an aura of self-satirizing ridiculousness. He also brings his deficiency of visual storytelling.
To the film’s credit, however, it manages to escape the clutches of Ellis’ severe shortcomings by reaching an intellect — not necessarily a quality one — absent in the rest of his filmography.
The film is clearly trying to capitalize on the recent demand for high-gore, high-shock, low-intelligence monster movies. Thankfully, it doesn’t quite succeed, largely because of the wit present in some scenes of the film, but also because of the PG-13 rating and overall lack of excessive gore. Shark Night is a distant relative, rather than a sibling, of last year’s egregious Piranha 3D.
That said, there is certainly plenty to criticize in the film. The cast of obnoxiously good-looking, banally diverse college students is, on the whole, unlikeable and pedestrian. Dustin Milligan, the film’s lead, stands out as the worst in the film; he is totally uncharismatic and unforgivably inauthentic. The rest are mostly forgettable even if not markedly poor, with one notable exception: Chris Zylka, who plays the pretty-boy character, initially a stand-out as a detestable character, but then a redemptive figure with two or three moments revealing considerable talent.
The direction of the film, technically speaking, can only be described as deficient. Ellis relies on long takes that emphasize nothing but laziness, and he never even attempts to craft creative or interesting framing, making the movie very boring to watch. Adding injury to insult, the CGI that is so prominent in the film, depicting the sharks themselves, is appalling — many video games have better graphics.
What lean quality the film can claim originates with the screenplay. There were clearly multiple writers at work here because amid the incompetent dialogue and annoying plotting, there are several redeeming elements. The script smartly recognizes that human nature can be much more frightening than computer-generated sharks.
Genre stereotypes and clichés are fairly consistently subverted, which shall be admired even if it sinks too often into exploitation. The film manages to make something resembling a human connection with its audience, generating a small degree of pathos, where other horror films opt for more violence and gore.
More simply, there were a few small, seemingly insignificant story beats that resonated a great deal, clearly reflecting that someone who worked on this script knows how to tell a decent story. There is an instance in the third act, for example, when an element of pop culture is wisely brought into the mix in a way that will make audience members laugh, but also no doubt make them think.
At the end of the day, Shark Night will be forgotten. It alternates between the bland and the radiantly absurd, but never attains a sufficient paucity of quality to make it infamous. On the other hand, its few strengths are not nearly enough to turn any heads.
The movie seems the result of a struggle between the capitalistic-minded studio and director, and important but suppressed writers just trying to generate a good story — the result of which is worth considering, but probably not worth watching.

No need for tabloid coverage
I am a frequent reader and admirer of Daily Trojan news coverage. Daily Trojan news stories— for example, the recent feature on USC’s new fundraising campaign and the article on Cindy McCain’s involvement with the Rossier School of Education — often focus on subjects important to the USC community. The Daily Trojan has developed a reputation for real news coverage of important events on and off campus.
As such, I was surprised and disappointed to see the headline of the Aug. 31 paper — “Parties pushed to 901 bar, West 27th.”
I thought the Daily Trojan concerned itself with issues more important than the weekend fraternity/sorority social scene.
Quite frankly, I don’t read the Daily Trojan to find out whether parties took place on West 27th Street or West 28th Street.
Headlines like that are fit for a gossip newsletter or a social tabloid. USC is an important American research university that takes itself very seriously.
It deserves a newspaper that takes itself seriously as well.
I hope that in the future the Daily Trojan will focus its news coverage on the sort of important issues that it has covered so well in the past.

Parking laws not enforced
I believe I speak for many clients of USC Transportation-Parking in complaining about scofflaw SUVs.  At any given time, my estimates suggest, as much as 10 percent of “Compact Cars Only” parking spaces are occupied by large pickups, vans, and especially SUVs.
Today it was a “Yukon” obstructing not only its own but an adjacent “compact” space as well with its decidedly non-compact bulk — driving me up another two levels to find a truly empty space.
Yesterday it was a “Tundra” that I squeezed my Honda Civic alongside — able to disembark only by crawling over the stick-shift to the passenger side and squeezing out a partially opened door.
Officers are quick to ticket for a missing or improperly displayed permit, but routinely ignore SUVs in “Compact” spaces.  USC Transportation’s General Parking Rules caution against misuse of “Reserved” or “Carpool” spaces, but say nothing about abuse of “Compact” spaces.
These spaces — like HOV lanes on the highway — exist in order to encourage efficiency and discourage big polluters.
Routinely ignoring violations, then, is tantamount to allowing single-occupancy SUVs in the HOV lane.
At present, USC’s compliance with this supposedly “green” policy is largely token; spaces for compacts are set aside, but anybody can use them.
Let these low-mileage, high-emission, space-hogging beasts park in unrestricted places on the structure’s roof, if none other are available.
Let parking officers enforce all, not just some, of the rules.  If it means some advantage for compacts and inconvenience for SUVs, well, that’s the whole point.
Robert English
Professor, international relations
ACTUALLY, Dr. English, different-sized spaces in parking facilities have the purpose of, in effect, squeezing smaller vehicles like yours into spaces whose size consumes less of the total space of the facility (in other words, taking advantage of their small size for the benefit of ALL sizes of vehicle, large AND small). They aren’t meant to favor or disadvantage anyone and, when used as intended (not always easy, or even possible), they don’t. That is, not unless one size or another is advantageously placed, as handicapped spaces are.
This takes nothing away from your point. I just thought I’d offer a corrective to your theory as to the purpose (AND effects) of different-size parking spaces.

Recently, the Office of the Provost, the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences Dean Howard Gillman and the Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito decided to end the Baccalaureate/M.D. Program. Keck ended the program because it “corresponded with a loss of diversity of majors and uniqueness among its applicants.”
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
This reasoning evaluates students on a very limited basis. Making any assertion at all about the uniqueness of applicants reveals an arbitrary judgment by the university.
A major does not say everything about a student’s academic ambitions; many students take classes outside of their majors and participate in other activities that set them apart.
Dismissing their uniqueness discounts many students’ other accomplishments and interests.
Through an intensive selection process, the program admitted a limited number of incoming freshmen to be guaranteed admittance to Keck each fall so long as they fulfilled a number of requirements.
The security of a program like  Baccalaureate/M.D. encourages students to worry less about the high-stakes game of getting into medical school so they can focus more on other areas of their undergraduate experience.
The “loss of diversity” meant that students were not showing (on paper at least) that they were exploring areas of the undergraduate experience beyond science.
The Baccalaureate/M.D. program was a talent magnet for USC. Terminating this program runs contrary to the university’s objective of improving its academic prestige.
Many students who choose to come to USC as undergraduates keep the university’s professional schools in mind. Destroying this incentive will steer many talented students away from USC, toward other schools, such as Penn State, which offers programs similar to  Baccalaureate/M.D.
As USC undertakes initiatives to expand its reputation as a prestigious research university, driving away talent in science-related fields is counterproductive. Attracting more pre-med students to USC means attracting more students eager to contribute to research and other projects that will add to the university’s reputation. Twelve percent of the fall 2010 incoming class were pre-med students.
The aforementioned reasons for ending the  Baccalaureate/M.D. program doesn’t seem consistent with USC’s goals of enhancing its national reputation.
The Dornsife-Keck Pre-Health Center has also stated that in terminating the  Baccalaureate/M.D. program, it has “progressed to [its] ultimate goal of opening a comprehensive Dornsife-Keck Pre-Health Services Center which provides involvement opportunities and advisement for all of our pre-health students, rather than just a few selected students.”
Though such statements are comforting to those outside the  Baccalaureate/M.D. program who might rightfully feel those in the  Baccalaureate/M.D. program have an unfair advantage at medical school admittance, this approach might also eliminate the very reason many students have chosen to attend USC.
Eliminating a program because it provides additional opportunities for only a select group of students challenges the rationale behind any special program — honors programs, in particular.
This way of thinking could likewise target any other selective program, such as Thematic Option, the alternative honors set of General Education classes that a select few students are admitted to each year.
A private university like USC, which gives a select number of students more opportunities and advisement than the rest of college students, should embrace specialized programs like Baccalaureate/M.D. to set it apart.
The reality is that trying to justify any sort of equalizing-of-opportunity approach in a highly competitive field is practically impossible.  Baccalaureate/M.D. provided some students with distinct advantages over other students, but pre-health students were all given as equal opportunity as possible to apply to the program to begin with.
Terminating  the Baccalaureate/M.D. program might make some pre-health students feel more relieved, feeling some of their competition no longer gets a free ticket into medical school. But does the university want to eliminate unfair competition by destroying an incentive that draws many talented undergraduates to USC each year?
Though the  Baccalaureate/M.D. program might not have fulfilled its original intentions on paper, the program nevertheless furthered some of USC’s other objectives, namely increasing academic prestige and showing that USC, a private university, has opportunities to offer students that many other universities lack.

Some students woke up Sunday morning still shaken by the events of the previous night, during which an armed gunman wounded two USC students after a confrontation escalated at a party at West 37th Place and Catalina Street.
But when most reached for their phones, there was no Trojans Alert to be found, no email from the Dept. of Public Safety and no message of reassurance from the university.
It was only through the power of our connected generation and local news coverage that most of the USC community was informed of the incident. Finally, Monday afternoon, a crime alert was issued by DPS, nearly 36 hours after the incident had occurred.
Officials from DPS told the Daily Trojan the delay was a result of non-specific descriptions of the suspect and a focus on handling the situation before alerting the community.
Simply put, that’s not enough.
Student safety is and should be the top concern of DPS and the university, and by refusing to send any kind of alert to the community until 36 hours later does not live up to the edict.
More than anything, in the hours that followed the initial reporting on the incident early Sunday, the top concern among students was the lack of an alert from any university authority, be it DPS or otherwise. Just as in a shooting last year when no alert was issued, students deserved to know.
Yes, people recognized the possibility of Trojans Alert-induced panic and concern, but mostly they just wanted to know what DPS knew.
The Trojans Alert system should aim to give students the information they need to stay safe and in short order, regardless of lack of description or resources available. That information was sorely missed early Sunday morning. At the very least, the crime alert should have been sent out earlier even if it lacked some minor details.
There has always been an uneasy relationship between the USC community and the west side of campus, one the university was slow to recognize. The university recognized the need to add security to that side and responded accordingly by bolstering security presence last year.
When violence did rear its ugly head in the area, university officials once again had the chance to step up to the plate, but this time they didn’t follow through.
This situation is reminiscent of the shooting last Spring just a few houses from my son’s home on 10th… a “safe” area.  No alert, nothing… It is not up to DPS to decide what might or might not be appropriate to post.  Like the news media, it should just post exactly what happened and when, as soon as possible and let the students decide what’s relevant.  There was a gunman loose near campus… that’s not serious?   The reputation of USC will continue to be smeared by these incidents and more so when it seems that DPS and the administration don’t find these incidents of concern.
Think about this… what if the assailant, instead of a gun at a student’s house, had a bomb and was making threats against the university?  We’ve have the Feds involved!  Let’s treat all incidents with such gravity!
On a related note, the university needs to buy up the properties around USC, improve them, and then encircle the campus…it’s the simple reality of the area….
DPS&USC=Fail!!!
The poor thing about this article is that it does not include possible reasons that DPS did not issue a Trojan alert. A Trojan alert could have caused panic, bring unwanted attention to the immediate area, and provide the community with incorrect or inaccurate information regarding the shooting. A lot of agencies are not allowed to comment or provide details during an active investigation, and the little info they do release, has to have accurate suspect description. If DPS sent out a text “shooting on west side of campus, no further details”. What next? Who was shot? I have friends that live on the west side, was it one of them? I live in the area, I’m going to check out the crime scene. These are all things that need to be taken into consideration, which this article did not.
Dear DT Editors,
Thank you for keeping us posted with updates throughout the long weekend. Because of the fear this incident caused, I felt safer knowing exactly what was happening and how it was being handled.

During the last five seasons, USC has outscored its opponents in each of the first three quarters over the course of a season, sometimes by a decisive margin. The results, however, vary when studying the Trojans’ performance in the fourth quarter.
From 2006 to 2008, USC never lost the fourth quarter battle. During that span, the Trojans outscored opponents 306-132 in the final period, also posting a 34-5 record.
By contrast, the Trojans have been outscored in the fourth quarter the past two seasons by 57 points and have posted a 17-9 record over that time frame.
Fourth Quarter Scoring Differential
2010: Opponents 118 – USC 72
2009: Opponents 88 – USC 77
2008: USC 105 – Opponents 32
2007: USC 76 – Opponents 76
2006: USC 125 – Opponents 66
That inability to stop opponents in 2010 late in games is well documented. Washington and Stanford drove to kick field goals as time expired to win, and Notre Dame engineered a late drive to beat USC as well.
In the season opener Saturday against unranked Minnesota, the Golden Gophers outscored the Trojans 7-0 in the fourth quarter. In fact, the Trojans failed to score at all in the second half. Although the lack of second half production might be unsettling to fans, sophomore cornerback Torin Harris’s interception that sealed the victory should provide optimism after watching leads vanish late in games a year ago.
Moving forward, the Trojans must outscore their opponents in the fourth quarter. They can’t rely on building big leads early and then trying to hold on for dear life. As the last five years of data show, winning the fourth quarter is an important indicator of how successful the season will be.

Researchers at the Keck School of Medicine have found that men in California’s Central valley who have been exposed to certain pesticides exhibit a greater prevalence of prostate cancer than those who were not.
The study used the cancer state registry to recruit 173 men, aged between 60 and 74, from the Tulare, Fresno and Kern counties. These men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer between August 2005 and July 2006.
The researchers then studied where these men had lived and worked between 1974 and 1999 and compared it with the pesticide use in those regions.
Researchers observed a greater cancer risk among persons exposed to pesticides with prostate-specific biologic effects; specifically, methyl bromide and a group of organochlorines.
The study brings into focus the pesticide drift related laws in the state, especially because the study focused on residential, and not occupational, exposure to the pesticides.
Dr. Myles Cockburn, one of the researchers, noted that “California’s Central Valley has by far the largest use of pesticides and the largest population potentially exposed to them in the U.S.”
However, the study is not without its critics. Dr. Robert Krieger, a toxicologist at UC Riverside, stated “pesticide use doesn’t equal pesticide exposure of bystanders” and it would have been better to calculate potential for absorption.
He also questioned the ability of research participants to accurately provide details of locations of pesticide exposure, which would skew the results.

Madonna has been awfully busy lately. The Queen of Pop recently debuted her film “W.E.” at the Venice Film Festival on Sept. 1, severed ties with her label at Warner Bros. Records and tried her hand at opening a series of international fitness center chains.
And just last week, Madge shocked airwaves when she announced her new studio album will be ready for release in 2012.
The pop diva made the announcement about her 12th studio album via an interview with Swedish television company, Sveriges Television. In the interview, Madonna was promoting her new movie “W.E.,” but dropped the news about the album as well. She has since received a much greater response for the record than for the tepid reviews the film has been getting.
The album will follow-up 2008’s No. 1 hit, Hard Candy. Spawning singles like “4 Minutes” featuring Justin Timberlake and “Give It 2 Me,” Hard Candy proved a massive worldwide hit. Since everything Madonna touches seems to turn to gold, this record should be equally successful.
It is rumored Madonna will be working with producers from her Ray of Light album, such as William Orbit, and it is confirmed that the singer is already in the studio.
On July 4, her manager tweeted “1st day in the recording studio for the new album;” so fans should be expecting a lead single in February or March, with the full album due in the spring.

Only a few blocks away from USC in Little Tokyo lies a quaint restaurant serving the infamous, spiciest ramen soup “on the planet.” Featured on Man vs. Food, Orochon Ramen has become a popular restaurant for another reason: its notorious challenge.
The famous Special #2 is what many flock to the restaurant to try. Customers who can finish the ramen and all of the soup within 30 minutes get their ramen free of charge, and their picture on the restaurant’s wall of fame as well.
Sound like an easy way to get free lunch? Think again. The dish is so spicy many aspiring wall-of-famers give up after only the first bite. Charlene Nguyen, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said she could only finish the noodles, pork and bamboo.
For those who cannot take the heat of Special #2, the rest of the menu has other delicious, milder items to choose from. There is even a scale to help customize how spicy you want your soup.
Orochon Ramen is the place to go if you are craving a steaming hot bowl of ramen, spicy or not, but taking up the challenge is an experience that everyone should try. Your burning taste buds might be worth that victorious picture on the wall of fame.

Many students begin their years as college careers with only vague ideas of how they wish to spend their time. At a large school such as USC, the on-campus opportunities are seemingly endless; however, it is difficult to refute the benefits of studying abroad. This upcoming week, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences plans to hold its annual study abroad fair Sept. 7.
Though many students who choose to study abroad do so their junior year, numerous foreign programs at USC accept younger students. With 50 different programs in 28 countries — and more opportunities being added each year — students are sure to find something to suit their academic and personal requirements.
Some programs are major-specific, such as the Fine Arts program in Cortona, Italy, while others have GPA and language requirements, like the exclusive Sciences Po Paris program, but most accept a wide variety of applicants.
During the Study Abroad Week, students can pick up information on various programs, talk to other students who participated in overseas study and discuss academic options with advisors and professors. In addition, they can learn more about other study abroad programs, such as summer sessions and Problems Without Passports.
To provide students with optimum flexibility in regards to the fair, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences is sponsoring a number of events during the week. Dornsife will hold a brief luncheon September 6; a general fair on Trousdale on September 7; a more detailed series of information sessions, based on country, on September 8; and two walk-in days September 9 and 10. Locations of each day’s activities are listed on the website.

Phone company Sprint filed a lawsuit against the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile, which comes on the heels of a similar suit by the federal Department of Justice last week.
 
The lawsuit alleges that the takeover of T-Mobile by AT&T would harm all mobile phone customers by reducing competition, raising prices and stifling innovation. AT&T plans to buy the Deutsh Telecom company for $39 million to expand and improve the company’s network, the company says.
 
“With today’s legal action, we are continuing that advocacy on behalf of consumers and competition, and expect to contribute our expertise and resources in proving that the proposed transaction is illegal,” Sprint said in a statement.
 
The DOJ filed its antitrust case against AT&T five months after the initial proposal. President Obama’s administration has said that the merging of the second- and fourth-largest phone companies would be a blow to consumers.
 
This action by the government came a surprise to both AT&T and Deutsh Telecom, representatives from both companies have stated. But, the DOJ has said it is open to negotiation in the coming stages of the antitrust investigation.
 
Sprint is the third-largest mobile phone company in the United States and Verizon currently sits at number one.
AT&T is attempting to buy T-Mobile for $39 billion, not $39 million.

Best Drama Series
Mad Men is the hands-down frontrunner right now, having won the award the last three years and featuring another critically-acclaimed season. Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire are perhaps more deserving for their sheer scope and incredibly dense storytelling, but Mad Men is Emmy voters’ perennial favorite.
Will win: Mad Men
Should win: Game of Thrones

Four out of the five nominees (the exception being Glee) would be completely deserving winners. Parks and Recreation really stepped it up in its second season, creating more well-rounded characters and finding hilarious gags in the mundane world they inhabit. Perennial winner 30 Rock had another excellent season and The Office has the advantage of just finishing its final season with Steve Carell, but last year’s winner Modern Family is just too good and too beloved by audiences and critics alike to be stopped.
Will win: Modern Family
Should win: Modern Family
 
Best Actor, Drama Series
Steve Buscemi is really the only person who could knock Hamm from the top spot, but that is unlikel,y as Hamm’s Don Draper is the most fascinating and multi-dimensional character in television.
Will win: Jon Hamm (Mad Men)
Should win: Jon Hamm (Mad Men)
 
Best Actor, Comedy Series
Steve Carell will win this in a cakewalk. In his final season as the iconic Michael Scott, Carell showed us his character’s previously-unseen emotional side and gave a fantastic performance in the season finale. He also created a character that will go down as a television legend. Emmy voters will not let this go unrewarded.
Will win: Steve Carell (The Office)
Should win: Steve Carell (The Office)
 
Best Actress, Drama Series
Critics love Juliana Margulies’ performance in The Good Wife and the show itself, so she is the best bet for the award. All of the nominees are deserving, especially Elizabeth Moss in Mad Men, but Margulies is the frontrunner for now.
Will win: Juliana Margulies (The Good Wife)
Should win: Juliana Margulies (The Good Wife)
 
Best Actress, Comedy Series
In a perfect world, Amy Poehler or Tina Fey would win this, but Emmy voters love giving the award to dramatic actresses in “dramedy” shows (see: Edie Falco in Nurse Jackie). This is why Laura Linney will win, even though hers isn’t really a comedic performance.
Will win: Laura Linney (The Big C)
Should win: Amy Poehler (Parks and Recreation) or Tina Fey (30 Rock)
 
Best Supporting Actor, Drama Series
Peter Dinklage was my favorite supporting performance of the year as the wisecracking dwarf Tyrion, but the Emmys’ love for Mad Men will give John Slattery the advantage in this race.
Will win: John Slattery (Mad Men)
Should win: Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones)
 
Best Supporting Actor, Comedy Series
With two-thirds of the nominees hailing from Modern Family, chances are the winner will come from the hit ABC sitcom. Right now the best bet would be Ty Burrell as the charmingly dorky dad, but don’t be surprised if Emmy voters go with someone else from the show.
Will win: Ty Burrell (Modern Family)
Should win: Ty Burrell (Modern Family)
 
Best Supporting Actress, Drama Series
Margo Martindale earned rave reviews for her turn as the matriarch of a Southern crime family in Justified, so right now she is the frontrunner. Archie Panjabi in The Good Wife shocked everyone when she won the award last year, but it is unlikely she will repeat.
Will win: Margo Martindale (Justified)
Should win: Margo Martindale (Justified)
 
Best Supporting Actress, Comedy Series
Last year’s winner Jane Lynch is once again the frontrunner, despite Glee’s writers completely mishandling her character this past season. Julie Bowen is the unsung hero of Modern Family, but sadly, it’s the showier performance that usually wins.
Will win: Jane Lynch (Glee)
Should win: Julie Bowen (Modern Family)

While waiting to be seated at the well-known Blu Jam Cafe on Melrose Avenue, I decided to explore the nearby shops.
Turns out I barely had to walk 10 feet before I struck gold. I’m always in search of fabulous vintage anything, and in my experience, it’s hard to find. American Vintage has everything from cowboy boots to floral ’80s rompers, and it’s all incredibly affordable.
The store is a particularly good find for petite shoppers. I was only there for 20 minutes, but I found two adorable floral rompers, each for $23, as well as a light pink dress for $18 that will make for a perfect beach cover-up .
Though not necessarily the go-to shop for high-end vintage pieces, if you’re in search of inexpensive, yet trendy vintage clothing, American Vintage is worth checking out.

Indie pop duo He Is We has a knack for turning meaningful narratives into love songs. The band released its newest single, “All About Us,” featuring Owl City last week.
The video for “All About Us” unfolds like a suspenseful romance. It begins with a couple enjoying a sunny day in the woods, but flashes in and out to clips of the girl sitting in a doctor’s office.
Viewers are left to wonder if the girl’s visit to the doctor is a happy or tragic event. When the climax of the story is reached, it is clear that something is wrong. Throughout the song, the words “all about us” keep the focus on the couple and go well with the flashbacks to happier times.
When the bad news is revealed at the end of video, viewers might get a little teary-eyed, but the love between the couple remains intact nonetheless.
A line from the chorus, “every heart in the room will melt,” is appropriate for a video that accomplishes just that.
He Is We is holding an “All About Us” cover art contest allowing fans to use photos of themselves and a person or thing they love. Winners will have the chance to win posters, shirts and more.
Look out for He Is We this fall on the Rise and Fall of My Pants Tour, with All Time Low, The Ready Set and Paradise Fears.
