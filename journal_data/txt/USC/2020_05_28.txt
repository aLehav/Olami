The California Court of Appeal overturned a court decision Thursday involving former USC kicker Matthew Boermeester, who was expelled from USC in 2017 following a Title IX investigation into an intimate partner violence incident with girlfriend Zoe Katz. 
Both Boermeester and Katz denied the presence of foul play in the January 2017 incident during which Boermeester put his hand on Katz’s neck and pushed her against a wall. Boermeester filed a lawsuit in March 2019 alleging that his subsequent expulsion ruined his academic and athletic careers. 
“We are very pleased that the Court of Appeal has again recognized that accused students under Title IX must have a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine critical witnesses at an in-person hearing,” said Boermeester’s attorney Mark Hathaway in a press release Thursday.
According to Hathaway, Boermeester was expelled after the Title IX Office presented security footage that depicted the two “clowning around and celebrating” in an alleyway. Two students witnessed the event.
In a 2017 statement, Katz maintained that she was not mistreated by Boermeester. 
”Nothing happened that warranted an investigation, much less the unfair, biased and drawn out process that we were forced to endure without speaking publicly,” Katz said in court documents. 
The decision also cited Doe v. Allee, a case regarding sexual misconduct allegations against former USC football player Bryce Dixon that resulted in Dixon’s expulsion, as precedent for extending cross-examination to third-party witnesses. The trial court ruling was reversed in January 2019 when the California District Court of Appeal court concluded that USC’s disciplinary proceedings neglected to provide a fair trial by failing to allow the cross-examination of key witnesses. According to court documents, the Title IX investigation also denied a live hearing involving cross-examination for Boermeester’s trial. 
Earlier this month, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos made changes to the department’s Title IX regulations, which, among redefining sexual assault, include the right to cross-examine evidence in a live hearing. 
USC is still reviewing the appellate court’s decision, the University told the Daily Trojan. At the time of oral argument before the California District Court of Appeal in early March, the University maintained that its disciplinary proceedings were fair and that the process of sexual misconduct did not apply in Boermeester’s case. 
“[The case] involves violence toward a girlfriend, not sexual misconduct,” the statement read. “It is not a case where ‘credibility of witnesses is central to the adjudication of the allegation,’ another requirement for having a live hearing as part of an investigation of a sexual misconduct case. It is a case of violence, perpetrated in public, witnessed by numerous people and caught on video camera.”
USC did not comment on the situation following the court’s choice to reverse the decision.    
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Hathaway said he hopes USC abides by the reversed decision and previous rulings regarding the University’s disciplinary proceedings. 
“The court set forth the requirements for a fair hearing in a number of cases involving USC … all of which pointing out that USC’s process for student discipline is fundamentally flawed and has been lacking in due process,” Hathaway said.

Senior Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Keck Medicine Thomas Jackiewicz is leaving USC May 31 to assume the role of president of the University of Chicago Medical Center and Chief Operating Officer of the UChicago Medicine health system, President Carol Folt announced in an email to faculty and staff Thursday.  
Jackiewicz had served in his position at Keck since 2012, during which Keck tripled its revenue to more than $2 billion. Jackiewicz and Keck integrated the USC Verdugo Hills Hospital into the school’s network and also set up more than 60 clinics across Southern California and Nevada. 
“Tom is widely recognized for building strong and collaborative partnerships with the Keck School of Medicine, and for overseeing a clinical operation that has proven to be skilled, caring and agile, as well as for effectively creating a team culture across our campuses,” the email read.
Folt also praised Jackiewicz and Keck for the school’s efforts during the coronavirus pandemic, commending Keck’s front-line workers for assisting in the school’s recovery efforts. She highlighted Keck Hospital and USC Norris Cancer Hospital’s standing on the US News and World Report’s Honor Roll, where the former ranked No. 16 nationally.
Rodney Hanners, COO of Keck Medicine and CEO of Keck Medical Center, will serve as interim CEO of Keck Medicine following Jackiewicz’s departure. Hanners has been with the University since 2015. 
Folt applauded Hanners’ involvement in helping Keck earn a Magnet designation by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, winning a Lantern Award from the Emergency Nurses Association for USC Verdugo Hills Hospital and creating a medical partnership between Keck Medicine and the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings team. 
“Rod has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues and under his leadership, Keck Medicine will continue to thrive and grow,” the email read. “Our community and our patients depend on the professionalism and excellence that our medical enterprise has come to embody. This incredible team will continue to meet and exceed the challenges ahead.”
Folt said Hanners and Jackiewicz will work together over the course of the next month to facilitate the transition. 
“Tom is always quick to credit his team — pointing out that the key to our success lies in the strength of our doctors, nurses and staff,” the email read. “We will all miss him and are grateful that his leadership will live on in the amazing group of medical professionals he brought to our ranks.”

JT Daniels’ USC tenure has officially come to an end. 
The redshirt sophomore quarterback announced Thursday via Instagram and Twitter his transfer to the University of Georgia to play for head coach Kirby Smart’s Bulldogs of the Southeastern Conference. USC head coach Clay Helton announced April 16 via USC Athletics’ Twitter that Daniels had entered his name in the transfer portal, but the possibility — albeit slim — remained that Daniels would stick with USC. 
As of Thursday, that possibility is no longer. Daniels is now expected to compete with graduate transfer Jamie Newman and incoming freshman Carson Beck for the starting job at Georgia. 
Daniels was a five-star recruit out of Mater Dei in the Class of 2018. 247Sports’ No. 2 pro-style quarterback in his class, Daniels won the starting job his freshman year and again in his sophomore year before going down in the 2019 season opener with a torn ACL and meniscus, causing him to redshirt.
“THANK YOU USC,” Daniels’ social media posts announcing his transfer read. “Excited for the future #GoDawgs.” 
As for USC, Daniels’ transfer figures to all but lock up the starting job for sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis in 2020. There had been speculation about an open competition in the fall, though Slovis was presumed the frontrunner for the job even if Daniels had stayed with the Trojans. Slovis posted the third-highest completion percentage in the nation last year at 71.9% and threw for 3,502 yards, compared to marks of 60.7% and 2,887 yards for Daniels in his lone full season at USC — though Slovis benefitted from an Air Raid overhauled offense led by offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Graham Harrell in 2019. 
Slovis and redshirt senior Matt Fink are now the only two scholarship quarterbacks on USC’s roster. 
The Trojans also added graduate transfer Mo Hasan in February, but their 2020 recruiting class included no quarterbacks. The scarcity at the position could create intrigue for USC after two starting quarterbacks in Daniels and Slovis missed time with injuries last season, forcing then-redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns to take snaps at quarterback in practice prior to USC’s Week 5 matchup with Washington. Worth mentioning as well is the departure of left tackle Austin Jackson to the NFL, meaning USC will look to fill that void to prevent the Trojans from being forced to dig deeper into their quarterback room. 
Of course, Slovis can put to rest those depth concerns by remaining healthy and productive the entire season — an outcome USC will hope for.
