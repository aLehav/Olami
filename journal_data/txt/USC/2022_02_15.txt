Rick Caruso will step down from his role as Board of Trustees chair “once a transition process is completed” to run for mayor of Los Angeles, he announced in a communitywide email Tuesday. President Carol Folt also released a communitywide message Tuesday morning announcing Caruso’s decision to step down. 
“Chair Caruso has been an inspired Board leader and his passion for and commitment to USC run deep,” wrote Folt in her message. “Ensuring the well-being and opportunity to excel of our students, staff, and faculty has always been his guide.”
The nomination and governance committee, which Caruso is a member of, has begun the selection process and expects to finish by the end of the semester, Folt said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. The mayoral primary elections will be held June 7, less than a month following commencement. 
The Board’s bylaws do not require trustees to resign if they hold public office, Folt said, but trustees must step down “whenever there is a conflict of interest in anything that we’re doing.”
“I don’t think he would need to recuse himself prior to the determination of the next Board chair,” Folt said. “But, again, if any sort of issue came up, we absolutely would do that.” 
Whether Caruso remains as a voting member of the Board if elected mayor is “his choice,” Folt said. Addressing the possibility of Caruso staying on as chairman if he loses the election, Folt said, “he’s made clear what he’s going to do, and the Board is moving forward with that process.”
Caruso, a billionaire real estate mogul and a Marshall School of Business alumnus, has served on the Board since 2007. He assumed his chair position in 2018 a week after former President Max Nikias resigned following multiple University scandals, including decades of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall’s sexual abuse becoming public. 
In his communitywide email, Caruso emphasized the  University’s steps since he took over as chairman, including altering Board governance policies and navigating the pandemic.
Following Caruso’s election to Board chariman, he pledged to conduct an investigation and report into Tyndall’s sexual misconduct as chairman. However, in a 2021 media briefing, the chairman said no report was ever created — saying that a report would cause “more pain and suffering to the victims.” 
The Operation Varsity Blues scandal embroiled USC during Caruso’s chairmanship. Olivia Jade was on Caruso’s yacht when she learned that the federal government had indicted her mother, actress Lori Loughlin, of taking part in a bribery scheme led by Rick Singer to admit Jade into USC. 
The Board also made efforts to modernize its voting laws and diversify its members during Caruso’s chairmanship. The changes, announced in November 2019, were set to take place over the next three years. The modifications, among others, promised to reduce the number of voting members on the Board from 55 to 35 and  to decrease the number of committees from 11 to nine. The Board currently comprises of 40 voting members and nine committees.
The reforms also included age limits, term limits and increasing diversity to mirror USC’s student population. The University does not collect information on the Board’s diversity, a spokesperson told the Daily Trojan.
USC alumna and University Park Campus congressional representative Karen Bass is also running for Los Angeles mayor. In Folt’s Tuesday email, she wrote that the University “never endorses or supports any political candidates,” but previously included that Caruso “guided the university during a period of great turmoil” and “led the way with openness and an unwavering determination that helped propel us forward.”
Folt said she intentionally only included details about Caruso’s actions at USC and did not include information about “his service within the community.” 
“We are very careful. It would be completely inappropriate for me to be selecting a candidate,” Folt said. “I’ve already spoken to several of the candidates about this, and I will be reaching out to all of them because we are really deeply committed to Los Angeles.”

USC and Los Angeles County will look to alter mask mandates as coronavirus rates continue to decrease in the University community, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a student media briefing Tuesday. As of Sunday, USC recorded a positivity rate of 1.94% for students and 0.9% for employees, a decrease from the 3.3% and 1.9% positivity rates the week prior for students and employees, respectively. 471 students and 15 employees tested positive for the coronavirus this week.
Cases continue to drop in L.A. County with a new case average of 4,666 compared to 41,682 cases the month before. The mask mandate for outdoor mega-events will be dropped Wednesday, the department’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said in a Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday.
“USC will follow the county guidance,” Van Orman said. “The County will continue to have the indoor masking requirement as long as cases remain elevated, but we are really heading in the right direction, both at USC as well as in the County.”
The Pardee Marks coronavirus testing site at University Park Campus will close Wednesday in light of the Rams Super Bowl Celebration parade. The Jefferson Lot site will remain open and fully staffed. For routine care and non-urgent appointments, Van Orman encourages appointment rescheduling through TeleHealth.
Students participating in the parade are encouraged to wear masks, especially for  attendees in close proximity to others. 
USC Student Health has not seen any increases in coronavirus cases as a result of the Superbowl, Van Orman said. Although previous variants with longer incubation periods required around two weeks to determine an event’s coronavirus spread, the omicron variant’s effect on an event can be judged more quickly due to its quick transmission, Van Orman said. Student Health expects to see spreads related to the Superbowl by the end of this week. 
As cases continue to drop, Van Orman said the University will look to scale back coronavirus-related requirements and policies, including lifting USC Housing’s “no-guest policy,” and Trojan Check. Policies will likely change within the county and school in the next few weeks, Van Orman said. 
However, limited masking at large indoor events, such as at USC basketball games, may cause a delay in the timeline of coronavirus policy changes.
“For folks to be patient and masking, particularly in an environment like a basketball game, can be effective,” Van Orman said. “Right now, numbers are declining, so we hope that things like [unmasked spectators] are not too big a setback, but compliance with the policies actually just makes it move faster, which is what we all want.”
As of Tuesday, the indoor mask mandate changed in California, although L.A. County currently warrants indoor masking. Once the County drops the mask requirement, USC intends to follow.
“The good news is that our mask mandate will go away when the County provides that direction,” Van Orman said. “It’s really going to be when the community prevalence falls, which we think will be within the next several weeks.”

In the first edition of my column, I’d like to make a formal introduction: My name is Sarah Hendartono and I am anti-Joe Rogan. Say what you want and call me a hater, but this is not a hot take. If you won’t take it from me, take it from the artists protesting against him. 
Over the past few weeks, Spotify and Rogan have been under fire for Rogan’s spread of coronavirus misinformation and a video compilation circulating of the podcaster using a racial slur during various episodes. 
The controversy began when Neil Young pulled all of his music from Spotify in late January in protest of the misinformation that “The Joe Rogan Experience” promoted. In a three-hour long episode, Rogan sat down with Dr. Robert Malone, an infectious disease researcher and vaccine skeptic, and made baseless claims about the pandemic and vaccines. Following the episode, hundreds of medical professionals signed an open letter to urge Spotify “to immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.”
While few other artists followed Young, the singer’s actions made this a high-profile issue and gathered press attention nationwide. In response, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the streaming site is a platform rather than a publisher, which makes them responsible for distribution instead of supervision. So my question for Spotify is this: How do you market yourself as a platform when you have a multimillion-dollar deal with Rogan to exclusively stream his podcast?
Honestly, Ek’s statement seems like an easy way out. It’s not like any other platform currently faces the same problem. If you exclusively host one of the most listened-to podcasts worldwide, you need to take responsibility for its content. Or, better yet, Rogan should stop giving a voice to people that will spread misinformation. Either Rogan is ignorant and doesn’t realize the influence his podcast has, or he simply doesn’t care – my guess is the latter.
Of course, the controversy doesn’t stop there. India.Arie, another artist that pulled her music from Spotify, shared a video of Rogan uttering a racial slur multiple times across past episodes. The podcaster has since posted an apology video on Instagram and said the clips were taken out of context but that the video looked “horrible, even to me.”
I shouldn’t have to explain why racial slurs shouldn’t be used in any context. This is a grown man that understands how language should be used and made the conscious decision to use slurs multiple times. Even in his apology, something about that “even to me” doesn’t quite sit right. It’s almost as if he knows he’s not a good person… 
After meeting with Spotify executives, Rogan took down 70 episodes from the streaming site.
These episodes shouldn’t have gone up in the first place. All of this comes down to Spotify’s irresponsibility and Joe Rogan’s moral corruptness. Spotify standing by him is not a good look. On its hiring website, the company states that it “wants to help shape a world that is welcoming for people of all backgrounds and identities, that centers justice and equity.” Yet, here it is in reality, exclusively promoting a podcaster that is willing to use racial slurs across 12 years of his show. If you advertise social responsibility as an incentive for people to work for you, you should probably apply it to your content.
While I’m not one to say cancel culture is always beneficial, people should’ve canceled “The Joe Rogan Experience” a long time ago. Let’s listen to what artists pulling their music have to say. It may be a small group, but their influence is finally bringing the problem with Rogan to light. They exemplify what it means to have a platform and how to use it for good. Hopefully, their influence can bring change to the streaming industry. But, frankly, they also shouldn’t be the ones responsible for this issue.
Either Spotify needs to better moderate its content or people need to stop giving Joe Rogan a platform to begin with.
Sarah Hendartono is a sophomore writing about current events in the entertainment industry. She is also the page design director at the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Showbiz, Baby,” runs every other Tuesday.

The Asian Pacific Alumni Association hosted the USC Asian Pacific Film Festival Saturday night, an event for students and alumni to highlight exemplary Asian Pacific Islander cinema and filmmaking from USC. Showcasing short films produced, written, directed by and/or starring API Trojans, the film festival allowed API USC community members and the entertainment industry to come together and celebrate the power of storytelling.
With screenings of a selection of eight short films, both live-action and animated, the 2022 APFF also included notable guests such as Amy Hill, an actress and stand-up comedian with more than 180 film and television credits. Known for her breakout performance as Yung-Hee “Grandma Kim” on the ABC sitcom “All-American Girl” and voiceover roles in “American Dad” and “Lilo & Stitch,” Hill served as one of three jurors for the film festival.
Hill spoke about her experiences playing characters of different Asian descents, including Korean and Filipina characters, and the way she approaches these roles to maintain accuracy and entertain the audience.
Hill, who often uses different accents in her performances, said “If the joke is the accent, I’m not into it. I don’t do jokes. I will do characters that have accents, but they have to be real people.” 
Jaimie Woo, a recent master’s graduate of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and another of the festival’s jurors, serves as the senior director of development at Culture House Media — a “Black, Brown and women-owned film and television production company and cultural consultancy.” Woo also serves as a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant and co-author of the New York Times bestseller “Yes She Can.” Woo produces various work promoting DEI in the workspace and emphasized its central focus in her production company.
“[The question on a set is]: How do you create an inclusive environment for all of your storytellers to come together and work in a collaborative way?” Woo said. “And also in the storytelling: Are we being accurate in our portrayals of certain populations? Are we giving in to stereotypes or bias?”
All of the films presented in the festival were intricately created with clear narrative threads and exciting visual design. Notable shorts included “SFGovTV Portraits: Sheriff Paul Miyamoto,”“The Best Friend,” and “Busan, 1999” — the latter winning the jurors’ award. “Busan, 1999” focuses on a Korean American woman’s return to her mother’s rustic home. They bathe and scrub each other, searching for reconnection and redemption after being driven apart.
Another short, titled “Imperfectly Perfect,” won the audience award through a voting process. In the film, Lucy takes care of Owen, a blind guitarist she has admired for years. When Owen is about to get his vision back, Lucy faces the struggle of whether to reveal her identity as a transgender woman to Owen.
Jon M. Chu, director of hits such as “In The Heights,” “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Now You See Me 2,” and one of the jurors for the competition, spoke about the revolutions in the entertainment industry today, one being the phenomenon of streaming platforms and the lesser emphasis on traditional box-office results.
While giving advice to the API filmmakers of the future, Chu spoke on the exciting changes he foresees being made by API artists in the world of cinema.
“It’s not easy being a filmmaker that has something new to say and something important to say in a world where the landscape is changing really quickly, and you don’t know where your job is coming from,” Chu said. “You don’t even know where the medium is ending up … There’s a whole new place that you are trailblazing and hopefully I will follow you and hopefully your stories will push me and we’ll do this all together.”
From buff animated frogs to tender moments of tragedy, the screened films at APFF demonstrated how content created by API Trojans can make an audience laugh, cry, smile or simply feel something special without coasting on stereotypical Asian tropes. Instead, the films touched on universal themes to capture the general audience and communicate that innate human feelings, such as loss or love, transcend culture and heritage. As Chu said, the future is bright for API filmmaking, and Trojans are at the forefront of that revolution.

If you took the Mission Road exit off of Highway 101 on Friday night, you probably got a quick glimpse of a completely reworked L.A. Skate Club, with people lining up on East Alviso Street in front of a giant poster created by senior Jack Parker, or p0sted, anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated Live2 Showcase 4. 
With an artist lineup featuring Nemo Lakes, Allen Haley, CHASE PAVES and Bay Area hip-hop group AG Club as the headliner, Live2 and 29th Street Productions organized a concert in just two months that defied a lot of odds — and they offered it to 500 people for free.
“I don’t like doing things that have been done before,” said Live2 founder and CEO McClain Portis, a senior majoring in business, cinematic arts. 
Friday’s showcase was the fourth of a concert series produced by Live2 and 29th Street that began in September. The goal of the series, Portis said, was to document the process and drive it takes to put on a show that just gets better and better. As a multimedia company with branches in digital marketing, live concerts and music video production, Live2 values telling the full story behind its unconventional work to “break the industry in any way that [it] can.”
“I wanted to be able to take people on the journey of being able to watch something grow from the ground up and knowing every single bit of work that went into it,” Portis said. 
The first to take the stage, alt-rock artist Nemo Lakes — whose first ever single “Piggy Bank” was released Feb. 4 — made a call to the dancing audience that began to fill the venue with great anticipation for the show. 
“Make some noise if you don’t know who I am,” said Nemo Lakes.
The crowd erupted, and it was the first sign that it was going to be a show to remember for all involved. Despite the inexperience of some acts and being only the fourth show orchestrated by the collaborating organizations, all signs of anything amateur were completely disguised by the production level and efforts from those involved — which included several worthy-of-attention up-and-comers in the music industry.
For Nemo Lakes — also known as Tyler Simpson, a senior majoring in business administration — this was his first live performance since 29th Street’s show dedicated to the passing of his friend Colin Jacobs last July. Starting off his set with his recent single, Lakes captivated the crowd through a variety of hip-hop and punk tracks and showed off his impressive skills on the guitar, certifying that he is an artist to keep an eye on. 
“Feels like dreams are coming true,” said Nemo Lakes in an interview following his set.
Allen Haley, an artist out of Pennsylvania who “got to meet everyone through the internet,” took the stage after and made his mark for a Los Angeles crowd. Two weeks prior to the show, Haley flew out to L.A. and shot a music video for his debut song, “TAKEN BACK,” released Feb. 4, all while crashing on a mattress on Portis’ floor — a tell to the level of dedication that went into this show. 
Haley’s drive was evident as he performed. Beyond immediately connecting with an audience previously unknowledgeable of his craft, a noticeably large group of the new performer’s family members in the crowd served to ground the otherwise surreal experience. 
“My whole family was here; it was an insane, super crazy moment,” Haley said. “It was the beginning of everything. It really is the beginning of something absolutely insane, I can’t even fathom.” 
The new artist brought on Arden Jones during his set as a special guest to perform “Serotonin Highs,” an unreleased song Jones wrote and posted on TikTok last December. Jones, discovered by Atlantic Records after going viral on the app the year prior, asked artists to duet the video and add their own verse, allowing Haley an opportunity to rise to the challenge. Ever since, Jones has been one of the many people in Haley’s corner. 
“[Haley’s] at the very beginning of it. Two years ago, I was at the very beginning of it, so I’ve been trying to show him the ropes as much as I can, and I know he’s got a shit ton of people out here doing that,” Jones said. “I’m just happy for him.”
Returning for his second showcase — the first being the inaugural show of the series — CHASE PAVES, a senior majoring in music industry, was an immediate crowdpleaser. With a deeper catalog than the former artists, his experience shined through his flow on both his solo songs and EDM-esque track “Guest List” produced by Nitti Gritti and shnd. 
As the crowd roared with energy following three impressive acts and a quick transition set from their DJ, the entirety of AG Club rushed the stage. Although leading vocalist Baby Boy, rapper Jody Fontaine and singer/rapper Mick Anthony comprise the core members, the Avant Garde Club is not complete without its dozen-or-so crew of rappers, filmmakers and designers. 
The blaring horns and bass rumble of “COLUMBIA” engulfed the room — thanks to the notably impressive sound system built entirely by the people of Live2 and 29th Street — and ignited battle cries from the crowd. After the hit track from their album “Fuck Your Expectations PT. 1,” captured the audience, Fontaine, who notoriously has asthma but no inhaler, placed himself at the front of the stage and (in between catching his breath) asked the crowd for a simple favor: Have a good time. 
“If I, like, asphyxiate or whatever it’s called, y’all gon feel really bad if y’all wasn’t going crazy. So y’all gotta match my energy, because otherwise I’m guilt trippin all of y’all,” Fontaine said. “So let’s turn up.” 
Students who attended the Welcome Back concert hosted by USC Concerts Committee in August are familiar with the intoxicating vigor the group yields from a crowd. Almost exactly at midnight, the group finished their final song — following a small sound issue — and the audience was left nothing short of satisfied.
According to Portis, Live2 was born out of a desire to put small artists on and tell stories of passion, work ethic and an overwhelming love of music. After coming to USC, Portis noticed that, to be a successful new artist nowadays, one has to build and maintain a following online, which requires an entirely different skill set beyond their craft. 
“I knew that I could tell stories and I’ve always loved building followings online so I was like, ‘Why don’t I start a brand where the entire idea of it is: I find people that deserve to have the spotlight, and I tell their stories and try to jump start on their career that way?’” Portis said.
For the three openers at least, there is no doubt that Portis succeeded in accomplishing this goal, and it will continue to be bolstered by the community he and 29th Street co-founder Joseph Arboles, a senior majoring in communication, have fostered.
“They really gave me one of the biggest opportunities of my life,” said Simpson of the organizers.
The first three showcases were held in the backyard of houses located within University Park, so organizing an event at an off-campus venue was a new feat for the crew. The price of attendance, or rather lack thereof, was also a decision Portis said he made in good conscience to prove that everything’s not about money. 
“I’m going to try and keep the concerts free moving forward which makes it cooler because then, with the artists … I can be like, ‘Hey, we’re not trying to make money off of you guys coming to play. We just want to do something really cool, and it’d be dope if you guys came back to the roots,’” Portis said. 
Blood, sweat and tears — and sponsorships from Liquid Death, Red Bull, Stash Co., Nectar Hard Seltzer and Study Break Hard Seltzer — made the show come together. 
When asked if they would take a break to celebrate the success of the show, Portis laughed and made it clear that the work never stops. 
“No, tomorrow I’m going to start on the next one. It’s too addicting,” he said.

The first Community Input Session for the hiring of a new Department of Public Safety Chief was held over Zoom Monday, led by Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance, Erroll Southers, and two co-facilitators who are both members of the DPS Chief Search Committee. Students, staff, faculty and community members from the University’s surrounding areas attended the session.
After former Chief John Thomas’ retirement Jan. 12, the Search Committee was tasked with finding a replacement to fill the role. David Carlisle, who previously served as assistant DPS chief, assumed the position as interim chief Jan. 13. 
During the session, the facilitators posed questions about the traits desired in the next chief. Participants vocalized the importance of accountability, one community member said that DPS should raise awareness of its roles and restriction for everyone on and around the University’s campus.
“We’re really pleased to hear that, because accountability was one of the four pillars in the Community Advisory Board report that we released in July,” said Southers in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We heard that from community members, we heard it from students today and that’s critical. [Accountability is] something we’re definitely going to focus on.”
The Community Advisory Board, a group of students, faculty and community members that oversee the University’s public safety practices, created the report, which also includes alternatives to armed response, community care and transparency — the pillars upon which the DPS Community Advisory Board aims to “re-envision public safety” and “create an independent DPS oversight body,” Southers said.
Participants also discussed improving the relationship between DPS and the USC community. Several participants said the next chief’s actions and views for the role should align with University values and create more positive engagement with the University and surrounding communities.
One community member asked about the University’s openness toward safety measures as alternatives to policing, to which Southers responded that the University’s focus is on progress. This semester, clinicians will accompany officers performing student welfare checks, while officers engaging with unhoused communities will partner with social workers.
Nathaly Fernandez, the special project manager at DPS, attended the session to voice issues on behalf of DPS. In the department, her primary responsibilities include sending out timely warning notifications and crime alerts.
“DPS is home to me, so I just want to make sure that the best interest of the organization is also taken into consideration through this process,” Fernandez said.
Fernandez said the session had a “good discussion” and that attendees brought “very valid concerns to the table.”
Southers said applications for the position are currently rolling in after the open position was announced Feb. 8. 
“I’m really delighted to say that in less than 24 hours, we had nine applicants from across the country,” Southers said.
Community Input Sessions will continue over the following months as the committee proceeds in its search, hosting six sessions until Feb. 26.
Southers said he encourages even more community involvement in the process in the weeks to come. 
“We want people to have this opportunity,” Southers said.  “Everything that they tell us, we’re going to be looking at, analyzing, and using as part of this process.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that John Thomas resigned. He retired. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

As a first-generation student from a low-income background, Vivian Wu did not know about the steps she’d have to take to apply and go to college. Enrolling in College Track, a program designed to assist students from low-income communities in achieving their post-secondary goals, gave Wu a guarantee for success in college.
College Track started in 1997 as an effort to help underrepresented and first-generation students from low-income backgrounds continue their education and pursue their bachelor’s degrees. Today, the program operates nationwide at various on-site locations and has partnered with various organizations and institutions, including USC. 
Through the program, Wu, a junior majoring in communication. attended financial aid workshops and received help writing her personal statements. When she decided to attend USC, Wu said she was paired with a college completion coach that guided her through internship and job opportunities. 
College Track operates across the Los Angeles region in Boyle Heights and Watts, and its newest site in Crenshaw, which opened to its first cohort of students last February, is located a few miles away from the University Park Campus. 
According to Senior Vice President for University Relations Samuel Garrison, the University’s partnership with College Track Crenshaw is just one of the many ways the University servies families. With the University providing hundreds of community programs to thousands of local families, he said the partnerships with programs and organizations intend to maximize positive impact and create opportunity in communities.
“Partnerships like College Track are part of President [Carol] Folt’s comprehensive commitment to expand college access and opportunity across Los Angeles, especially on the Eastside and South L.A.,” Garrison said. “Collaboration is essential, which is why we’re partnering and supporting organizations like College Track. We learn from each other, and we collaborate to build a shared vision in service to the communities we serve.”
Wu said it’s “great to hear” the University is collaborating with College Track, as both institutions have sets of “valuable” networks and resources that students enrolled in the program will benefit from. 
“Being able to have that partnership happen is great in hopefully getting those resources to people who need it and who desperately want it as well,” Wu said. “USC is known as such a prestigious and privileged place, so it’s great to see that they’re taking a step toward sharing some of those privileges and sharing some of those resources.”
Among those part of the College Track’s Los Angeles Advisory Board for the Crenshaw location is former alumna and Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix, who joined the board last July. Felix, who graduated from USC in 2008, grew up in the Crenshaw District.
“College Track having a center in the Crenshaw District is so huge because there’s so many students there that can benefit and have such bright futures,” said Felix in an interview with College Track. “I know the impact that it’s going to have on their lives, and it’s really going to not only affect the students but really change families and [the] community as a whole.”
Across the College Track sites, including those located in the L.A. area, the program sticks to a plan that serves students for 10 years, beginning in the ninth grade and ending in the student’s final year of college. By doing so, College Track aims to eliminate “academic, financial and social-emotional barriers” that prevent students from attaining a college education. 
According to Crenshaw Site Director Wintor McNeel, students who visit the locations and commit to the program receive guidance and preparation from its academic affairs department, student life department and wellness department. Each department carries a different purpose, such as one-on-one tutoring.
McNeel also said College Track aids parents by explaining the college process through informational nights that talk about topics such as the college admission process and financial aid.
“Be that many of our students are first generation, we want to ensure that they are able to overcome any systemic barriers that their family members face that prevented them from getting into college and ensuring that our students are prepared and the families, as well,” she said. 
Across all of its sites, College Track has 15 active students who currently attend USC in the program, three of whom are from the Los Angeles region. Apart from those enrolled, four more students are alumni of the program and have already received their bachelor’s degrees.
One of those active 15 students is Jordan Sosa, a freshman majoring in electrical and computer engineering, who is part of College Track San Francisco. He enrolled in College Track during his freshman year of high school and joined after hearing about the ACT preparation and essay writing help it offered. He also said the guides of the program kept track of his academic progress. 
“The most helpful part of it was definitely the mentors and the staff,” he said. “They keep tabs on you a lot. They make sure you’re on top of your things and make sure you’re on track to graduate high school and get into college.”
Like Wu, Sosa recognized the partnership between College Track and the University as a “great thing,” considering how families may not be able to afford college tuition costs. 
“There’s a lot of bright students out there and underserved communities that without the right guides, they wouldn’t be able to make it to these prestigious schools without the guides,” Sosa said. “I think that the partnership really helped that a lot because they will motivate them to apply here.”
L.A. Regional Executive Director of College Track John Lee said the partnership between the University and College Track will allow students the chance to connect to more offerings from the University, such as the USC Bovard Scholars Program, which helps high-achieving students with financial barriers find admission at top colleges across the nation and even help them matriculate. 
“I’m confident that our partnership is going to help expand the pipeline of College Track students who apply to USC and for the University community to be strengthened by the presence and the experiences of our students,” Lee said. “The partnership enables us to offer College Track services to more students in our region, regardless of where they enroll in college, and for that, we’re extremely grateful.”
Lee said he hopes others will have the opportunity to hear about the program and potentially join.
“We joke within our College Track team that College Track is one of the best kept secrets,” he said. “We don’t want to be a secret anymore … What I expect to see is that we’re gonna see more and more students each year.”
Since the Crenshaw location is new, it currently only serves high school freshmen and sophomores. However, Lee said he expects those students will eventually graduate from high school and go off to college and that the Crenshaw site will see an increase in enrollment over time. At full capacity, Lee said that the Crenshaw location would serve at least 240 students spanning from the ninth to 12th grade. 
McNeel said serving in College Track gives her the opportunity to see herself in the students. Being a part of the program, McNeel said, aligns with her educational philosophy of meeting students and being able to support them.
“It speaks to my soul in so many ways because I was the students, and I am the students that we serve growing up in the Crenshaw district community — a first-generation college student,” McNeel said. “Being able to return to my community has always been a dream of mine; to serve the community and help students know that college is not an option, but it is an opportunity that they have access to is invaluable.”

As the child of Indian immigrants, Jan. 26 has always held a special place in my heart as India’s Independence Day. This year, the day carried a double purpose, as it also marked the return of the USC Farmers Market.
The farmers market spans across McCarthy Quad, filled with rows and rows of fresh produce, locally made treats and delicious meals. There are few joys in life that compare to sitting under the sun and enjoying a pupusa from one of the vendors at the market.
However, like most economic structures, farmers markets are significantly more complicated than they seem. While farmers are set free by the lack of regulatory practices, low-income consumers pay the price for the lax structure of farmers markets.
From the perspective of the vendors, farmers markets offer a direct line to their consumers, cutting out the corporate middlemen who often shortchange farmers.
In the popular New York Times podcast “The Daily,” reporters learned about the economic hardships ranching families have experienced over the last few years. Steve Charter, a third-generation cattle rancher, explains that 85% of the meatpacking industry is controlled by only four major companies.
As a result of this monopoly, corporations force farmers to sell their cattle at an astoundingly low price only to turn around and inflate the cost of beef in grocery stores. At the end of the year, Charter and other family ranchers are lucky to break even when they sell their cattle.
Ranching is one of the many sectors of agriculture dominated by corporate control. Economists use a concept known as the concentration ratio to measure and describe the corporate control over a certain industry; they estimate that if an industry’s concentration ratio is 40% or more, corporations can use their power to force out smaller competitors and inflate prices for consumers.
From poultry to corn, every aspect of agriculture has a concentration ratio of over 40%. This level of corporate control increases the cost of farming and decreases the prices at which farmers can sell their goods.
In the meantime, consumers pay higher-than-ever costs for their produce. Rather than fulfillment of the promise to use corporate efficiency and new technology to bring down the cost of food, consumers have seen the cost of their food remain stagnant or even increase as corporate profit grows.
This phenomenon was only worsened by the coronavirus. As consumer prices for everything from toilet paper to beef skyrocketed, farmers’ profits decreased even as demand increased. Even in these unprecedented times, consumers and farmers struggled financially to make room for corporate profits.
This is where farmers markets come in. Instead of blindly hoping for fair corporate pricing, farmers and ranchers can sell directly to the people eating their food. This transaction is the best of both worlds: Consumers pay fair prices, while farmers do not have to worry about the middlemen eating into their profits.
The beauty of a farmers market lies in its simplicity. By creating a casual space for transactions, farmers and consumers can come together to help one another. However, this lack of regulation makes it harder to ensure accessibility for community members reliant on food stamps.
Though some farmers markets accept Electronic Benefits Transfer or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, these markets must be specifically licensed. Since farmers markets have fewer administrative structures, many lack the resources or incentive to receive such licensing.
Many low-income individuals live in food deserts where they do not have healthy and affordable meals. A local farmers market could make a big difference in such a community. They have the power to bring fresh, healthy and affordable ingredients much closer to community members.
However, farmers markets that do not accept SNAP or EBT only worsen conditions in a food desert. They would serve as competition for any newly opened farmers markets or grocery stores in the area, thus disincentivizing developments that could aid low-income community members.
Like most things, farmers markets are not all good, nor are they all bad. From the farmers’ perspective, these markets serve to regain control over a corporate-dominated industry. However, the residents who are most in need of access to food are those who cannot enter the space.
As consumers, it is our job to protect the good that these marketplaces offer while pushing for more equitable practices. Like with most capitalist structures, there is work to be done.

After begging my mom for months to let me download it, I finally became a proud user of Instagram in the sixth grade. My name wasn’t in my username and I wasn’t allowed to post pictures of myself, but I didn’t let that stop me. I immediately got to work, posting every relatable Teenager Post screenshot I found on the internet. 
There were so many cherishable trends I look back on — the days when I listed every single one of my middle school friends in my bio, when Squaready was all the rage, when VSCO filters (C1 if you know what I mean) took Instagram by storm — all of these trends defined eras in my life on Instagram. 
However, one thing has always stayed constant: Social media has always been a way of sharing the best parts of life. This is where Instagram gets complicated. By all means, I am not an Instagram hater. I’m not the mom that tells you it’s killing your brain cells or wasting your time. Instagram creates a special space for many, whether it be an outlet for creativity, a way to promote work or a space to catch up and share with friends, old and new. It can also be the confidence boost you need — I’m guilty of doing photoshoots with my friends for Instagram, and I’m sure most people reading this are, too.
The real issue has always been the inherent sense of comparison that comes with Instagram. I see it as less of what you post yourself but rather how you digest the photos you come across. Whether it be a beautiful person, nice clothing, pretty vacations, a healthy relationship or a plenitude of friends, it is easy to feel like others have what you are lacking. It is a rabbit hole of insecurities that  build when you forget this is someone showing only the most beautiful parts of their life, just like you do for yourself.
Because social media has become so tied to the identities of others and how we judge each other in our generation, it is used as a means of best representation. I have heard many judge whether someone seems cool and if they would consider being their friend just on the basis of a glance at their feed. Because of the effort put in by so many, it is important that said effort is recognized and understood by all users.
In the last year, there has been a huge movement toward “casual posting.” People are trying to lose the effort behind Instagram in order to show a more authentic, casual side of their world. The thought is there, but the execution is dangerous. If I scroll through my feed now, it’s filled with slideshows or “dumps” with mirror selfies, cute food, flowers, pretty scenery, lots of friends and fun nights out.  Mixed with an absence of filters and an emphasis on funny photos rather than staged, this has changed the feel of Instagram in a move toward authentic posting. 
The problem is Instagram can’t be casual. Believing in this will only hurt users’ mental health. An unedited album showing every pretty part of one’s casual life leaves behind the mutual understanding of users everywhere that Instagram is showing only the best parts and enters a fuzzy gray area that makes people believe what one is posting is a more accurate representation of what their day-to-day life looks like when really it is just a another facade.
It isn’t that posting can’t be casual — it can be and there are a few users out there who really try to capture their life authentically, but it is not the standard or the status quo. Instagram is a way of putting our best foot forward in a neat package that anyone on the internet can access and use to judge us. Just because the aesthetic changes from orange filters and white borders to effortless dumps doesn’t mean each photo isn’t hand-picked to create a particular image of the user at their best. 
By acknowledging  Instagram can never be casual and rather that it is society moving between aesthetics of casualness, we can better protect users of social media everywhere. Jealousy and insecurity bred by Instagram will always exist, but it is also now deeply rooted in our culture. A shared understanding this is all of us representing our best selves and that the casual beauty of one’s photo dump isn’t the true image of their everyday life is the best way to support and navigate the complicated relationship between Instagram and mental health.

What a time for basketball around the country. Six of the top 10 teams in the AP top 25 lost in a strong week for NCAA underdogs. In the NBA, a couple of blockbuster trades rocked the league. 
I’ll take you through a few of my thoughts on this roller coaster ride of a week.
What’s wrong with Baylor?
After a 15-0 start, Baylor has sputtered out in Big 12 play. An 83-59 drubbing at Kansas bookended a 4-4 skid for the Bears. So why have the reigning national champions looked so mediocre since their sizzling start? 
The absence of sophomore guard LJ Cryer probably has something to do with their recent duds. Baylor’s leading scorer remains out, and the first three games he missed were a disappointing 1-2 stretch. 
Despite recent victories over Kansas State and Texas, the Bears have not looked like a convincing bet to repeat as national champions more than a month. Cryer was only out for two of the Bears’ four losses. Clearly, something else is at play. 
Senior guard James Akinjo has hit a rocky stretch recently, posting a combined 5 points against a pair of Oklahoma teams and failing to hit a single shot against Kansas. In games the Bears have dropped, Akinjo averages 7 points per game. In games Baylor has won, however, the senior guard averages 14.3 points per game. 
It seems the team’s success goes as Akinjo goes. For the Bears to reemerge as a credible national title contender, Akinjo will have to rediscover his shooting touch.
Andrew Wiggins. All-Star Starter.
What a ride it’s been for Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins. As a freshman out of the University of Kansas, Wiggins was the number one overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. Wiggins had an enormous amount of hype among NBA observers, perhaps more than any other prospect since Lakers forward LeBron James. 
Unfortunately, the veteran wing hasn’t quite lived up to expectations. Despite averaging a respectable 19.4 PPG over his career, Wiggins hasn’t done much else. He’s never displayed much of the playmaking ability that top-level wings must show today. On defense, he looks more like a traffic cone than a useful help defender.
Wiggins’ player efficiency rating for this season, ostensibly his best season, is 16.56. For context, a league-average player would sit at a 15, putting Wiggins just a hair above the mean. Still, it hasn’t all been bad for the “Maple Jordan.” 
The forward scored 8,710 points on the Timberwolves, making him their third all-time leading scorer. With his All-Star selection, Wiggins became the third first-time All-Star to be named a starter in his eighth season or later, according to Elias Sports Bureau. Realistically, the lofty projections for the Canadian forward were always far too high. 
Wild ways to win in Wyoming
Wyoming has bounced back from an eighth place finish in the Mountain West laset year to sit top of the league at 10-1. Sophomore forward Graham Ike has led the Cowboys’ turnaround. After an injury-hit freshman season, the forward from Aurora, Colo. has exploded to the tune of 20.6 points per game. That average puts him 10th in D1 NCAA rankings, a ranking he’ll hope to retain as the Cowboys head into the stretch run that’ll decide their NCAA tournament hopes.
No loyalty in the league
It’s easy to look at the recent rise in player movement around the NBA and mourn the loss of loyalty. Current Lakers forward LeBron James’ move to the Miami Heat kicked off an era of unprecedented player turnover that shows no signs of slowing. With all these moves, it’s easy to miss the lack of loyalty franchises around the league are showing in return. 
Nowhere was this loss more clear than in Sacramento last week, the scene of a blockbuster trade. Budding star and Sacramento Kings guard Tyrese Haliburton was part of an exchange that moved Indiana Pacers center Domantas Sabonis to the Kings. It seems the only place on Earth this trade made sense was the Kings’ front office. 
Haliburton was known around the league for wanting to be the guy to try to lead this franchise out of the doldrums. According to former Kings forward Matt Barnes, “the team was in shock, devastated; Tyrese was in tears.” 
Recently named to the NBA Rising Stars Game, Haliburton came crashing down to the harsh reality of basketball last week. Welcome to the league, Tyrese.

Men’s tennis will kick off a week of competition in Seattle with a neutral match against Portland Tuesday afternoon. 
After a loss to No. 8 Stanford and an impressive comeback victory over UC Berkeley during their last road trip, USC will look to double its win streak as they head into this weekend’s ITA National Team Indoor Championship.
ITA’s most recent coaches’ poll saw the Trojans fall three spots to No. 11 after suffering their first season defeat to the Cardinal. 
Head Coach Brett Masi said he believes the team’s energy led to the loss.
“We came out incredibly locked in …, and then we let down going into singles,” said Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “So it’s really sustaining that energy through the entire match that needed to happen.”
After USC doubles point victories from freshman duo Ryan Colby and Peter Makk and junior Stefan Dostanic and senior Bradley Frye, Stanford captured four straight singles points to win the match 4-1. 
Players saw the loss as a valuable experience, since the Trojans will face Stanford again next month and will likely encounter the Cardinal a third time in April’s Pac-12 tournament.
“It showed us that we need to keep on building our chemistry,” freshman Wojtek Marek said. “We cannot be happy with our level now. We have to keep on growing.”
USC followed its loss to Stanford with a 4-2 comeback victory against the Golden Bears. The win featured impressive singles performances from Marek Makk. The two each allowed only three points in their two set victories.
“We came on the court and showed a completely different attitude,” Makk said. “I feel like we have a lot more confidence after that match.”
The Trojans have relied heavily on their newcomers this season with three freshmen in their starting lineup. Makk currently sits at No. 46 nationally in the ITA’s singles rankings, reaching as high as No. 35 earlier this season. 
USC will return its entire starting lineup next season, including ITA singles No. 4 ranked Dostanic.
“[Makk and Marek] are definitely very electric. And Ryan Colby, he’s had a great start to his freshman campaign,” Masi said. “All of these guys are great in their own right. They all have their pluses, but they all have their minuses … and that’s why they’re here: To grow and to get better.”
USC will look to build on their success against Cal as they head into Tuesday’s match against Portland. The victory featured USC’s first doubles point loss of the season, which Masi hopes won’t become a trend.
“Overall, we had a little bit of a letdown starting in the Cal match from the energy we put forth against Stanford,” Masi said. “We tried a few different combinations … and maybe we were mispositioned a little bit but, either way, the biggest difference was just our energy going into the match.”
Masi thinks that focus will be the team’s key to victory Tuesday after more than a week off from competition.
“Just being sharp, having good focus and awareness, and just going out and playing our tennis,” he said. “If we play our style of tennis, I don’t see us having too much trouble.”
The Trojans take on the Pilots in neutral play at 4 p.m. in Seattle.

No. 1 USC traveled to La Jolla this weekend to face top ranked opponents in the Triton Invitational. The Trojans handled business early, winning their first three games against No. 16 UC Santa Barbara, No. 13 Long Beach State and No. 6 Hawaii. USC came up short in the title match against No. 3 UCLA, losing 11-10 on a game-winning goal scored with only 23 seconds left.
Despite playing two games per day, the Trojans won with ease Saturday. USC won its first game of the tournament against the Gauchos 10-4, with 2-meter redshirt sophomore Tilly Kearns and utility freshman Honnie Vandeweghe-O’Shea leading the charge with three goals apiece.
Later that day, the Trojans took down the Beach 17-6, in which USC never trailed. Although Kearns had a hat trick, it was senior utility Bayley Weber who stole the show by scoring two goals in the first 75 seconds of the game. Weber finished the game with four total goals.
USC started Sunday with the semifinal match against Hawaii that proved a much closer game than the previous two matches. USC looked set for victory, but two back-to-back goals by Hawaii had the game deadlocked at five with more than four-and-a-half minutes left in the third. 
The Trojans would then rally off three straight goals to take back control of the game, winning 9-7. The win secured a spot in the final against crosstown rivals the Bruins. The main charge against the Rainbow Warriors was led by senior driver Grace Tehaney, who scored five goals in the game, tying her career high.
A back-and-forth game with 11 total lead changes throughout the contest, USC came up just short against UCLA, losing 11-10. Weber and Kearns once again scored three goals each, but it was just not quite enough, as the Trojans came up on the losing end of the matchup. 
This is USC’s first matchup against the Bruins since last year’s National Championship when the Trojans were victorious in claiming their seventh NCAA title.
Although disappointed with the outcome, Head Coach Marko Pintaric was pleased with the team’s overall performance.
“Our final six defense was actually holding well, and, offensively, we scored enough goals to win the game,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Every loss like this, it’s a learning experience for the team. I think they took it in the right way.”  
USC will look to rebound from their hardfought loss as it hosts No. 2 UC Berkeley next weekend in their first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matchup of the season. Following their play against the Golden Bears, the Trojans will take part in the Barbara Kalbus Invitational to face additional top ranked teams. 
Pintaric is ready to embrace the tough competition in the next few weeks.
“We’re very excited about a good game this weekend against Cal,” Pintaric said. “The weekend after, where we meet all the top 16 teams and be tested again, so I can only see the progress moving forward.” 
The season fully underway, USC will begin the MPSF conference season against Cal Feb. 19 then move on to the Barbara Kalbus Invitational Feb. 25-27.
