Despite facing its toughest stretch of play since February, USC added two resounding conference victories to its streak of 45 consecutive wins.
The No. 1 Trojans (25-0, 6-0) took down No. 12 California 6-1 Sunday after sweeping No. 11 Stanford (14-6, 4-1) on Saturday for the second time this season.

The clinching point over the Golden Bears came courtesy of No. 17 senior Daniel Nguyen, who defeated No. 57 Carlos Cueto 6-4, 6-2 to give the Trojans a 4-0 lead.
USC began the day with its seventh straight sweep in doubles, giving the Trojans an early 1-0 advantage.
The effort was headlined by senior Steve Johnson and freshman Roberto Quiroz, who captured their 11th straight win together with a 8-3 victory over No. 3 Nick Andrews and Christoffer Konigsfeldt.
“All of us have been working hard in doubles and working on the small things,” Nguyen said. “We’re gaining a lot of confidence together, and hopefully we can keep it rolling.”
Before Nguyen’s clincher, Johnson took down No. 55 Andrews 6-2, 6-2 for his 57th straight singles win, while No. 34 freshman Yannick Hanfmann defeated Konigsfeldt 7-5, 6-2.
“I needed that match today. I think it was the best performance by me in a couple weeks. I needed some confidence, and I got it from today’s match,” Hanfmann said.
With the victory in hand, No. 20 sophomore Ray Sarmiento fell to No. 41 Ben McLachlan 4-6, 2-6 for Cal’s only point of the match.
Quiroz and freshman Eric Johnson then capped off USC’s 6-1 win with two straight set wins. Quiroz’s win marked his 14th straight singles victory.
The back-to-back was originally slated to begin with the matchup against the Golden Bears on Friday, but the match was delayed to Sunday because of rain. Instead, the Trojans began the weekend with a 7-0 win over the Cardinals.
After a sweep in doubles play led by Johnson and Quiroz’s win over No. 5 Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher, Hanfmann and Nguyen took their respective singles matches in straight sets.
With a 3-0 lead secured, No. 56 sophomore Emilio Gomez clinched USC’s victory over Stanford with a 6-2, 6-4 finish over John Morrissey.
No. 46 Klahn, who was the last player to give Johnson a singles loss in collegiate play last January, could not achieve the feat again, falling 3-6, 4-6 to the reigning NCAA singles champion.
Sarmiento and Quiroz took down their respective opponents in No. 30 Thatcher and Daniel Ho to cap off the perfect win.
The Trojans are now 132-33 all-time against the Golden Bears and 105-76 all-time against the Cardinal.
“It’s definitely a great confidence booster to beat some tough teams,” Nguyen said. “We had the mindset to seize that moment and play aggressively, and we executed.”
The Trojans will look to finish with an undefeated record in their regular season finale against No. 6 UCLA (19-2, 5-0) at 3 p.m. on Friday at Marks Tennis Stadium.
OOOOOOhhhhhh Nooooo!

On a chilly, windy Saturday, the USC women’s sand volleyball team participated in the first day of USA Volleyball Beach Collegiate Challenge, held in Hermosa Beach, Calif. The team posted a 2-2 dual match record for the first day.
USC first defeated Hawai’i 4-1, then later swept Loyola Marymount 5-0. They lost matches, however, to Pepperdine and Long Beach State by 3-2.
In the afternoon’s pairs tournament, USC’s No. 3 pairs team of junior Katie Fuller and sophomore Natalie Hagglund and freshman No. 5 Kati Duddridge and graduate student Megan Thornberry both ended with 3-1 records, while the No. 4 team of senior Kendall Bateman and freshman Eve Ettinger were 2-2.
As for USC’s No. 1 team, graduate student Geena Urango and sophomore Sara Shaw ended the day with a 1-3 record, with two of their losses coming in three sets.
In standout volleyball play, however, USC’s No. 2 pairs team of sophomore Kirby Burnham and graduate student Kelly Irvin won all four of their matches, defeating Hawai’i, Loyola Marymout, Pepperdine and Long Beach State’s pairs teams.
Burnham and Irvin were one of four pairs that won all four of their matches. Long Beach State’s Cailtin Ledoux and Tara Roenicke and Pepperdine’s pairs teams of Kelley Larsen and Stevi Robinson and Victoria Adelhelm and Kellie Woolever were the other teams to play through the pairs tournament undefeated.
Pepperdine did not lose a single match and ended the day at 4-0 and Long Beach State went 3-1. Hawai’i went 1-3 while Loyola Marymount did not see a single win and lost all four of its matches.
The team will now focus on reaching the American Volleyball Coaches Association Collegiate Sand Volleyball Championships, to be held in Gulf Shores, Ala., the last weekend of April.

Seventeen straight wins and a Mountain Sports Pacific Federation regular season title later, the USC men’s volleyball squad is riding high entering the postseason. Saturday night, the top-ranked Trojans (22-4, 18-4) went on the road and swept No. 11 Cal State Northridge 25-19, 28-26, 25-17 to clinch the top seed in the conference tournament.
After a relatively stress-free first set, the Trojans earned their stripes in a see-saw second set that had five lead changes and an incredible 22 score ties before it ended fittingly with a Tony Ciarelli-kill. The teams continued to go back and forth in the third, with the score tied at 11 before the Trojans went on a 9-2 run to pull away in the clinching set.
Setting up success · Freshman setter Micah Christenson (above) is a big reason the Trojans have won 17 straight matches and are ranked No. 1. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Senior co-captain and outside hitter Ciarelli had another monster performance with a match-leading 19 kills, contributing three blocks and hitting a stunning .818 with only one error.
“No question,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said when asked if Ciarelli should be named AVCA Men’s Division I-II National Player of the Year. “No one has faced what he has and done more for their team than Tony.”
Junior opposite Maddison McKibbin had eight kills to go with four blocks, while freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers had a match-leading six blocks along with six kills.
USC hit .425 for the match while holding the Matadors to a .247 clip. Opposite John Baker and outside hitter Brandon Lebrock led the way for CSUN with 11 and 10 blocks, respectively.
Though the offense was firing on all cylinders, the Trojans’ impressive defense was key to the victory.
“Defensively we were very efficient,” Ferguson said. “We did a better job of watching film in the week and slowed their key attackers down by forcing them to alter shots.”
After losing at home to UCLA in early February, the Trojans have been close to invicible ever since. The 17-game win streak is USC’s longest since the 1990-91 season.
“We’re more relaxed,” Ferguson said about this year’s team in comparison to last year’s squad that lost in the Final Four to underdog UC Santa Barbara. “They [the team] buy into our team concept a bit better, and I feel that they’re a much closer group.”
Having made it two of the past three years, the Trojans will continue their quest for the Final Four on Saturday when they host CSUN at the Galen Center in the first round of the MPSF tournament. If the Trojans advance, they will face the winner of UC Irvine and UCLA in a crucial semifinal matchup.
Great article. Yes this year’s team is a closer knit group. Studying film really works. Coach Jeff Nygaard’s brilliant advice to MBers about blocking and hitting have paid huge dividends.
The players are confident but not cocky. They are pushed every practice by the best teammates in the USA.
These guys make the starters work hard and are ready to step in when needed.
Maddison McKibben has added quality to the Opposite Hitter position. When he plays the other team has to contend with a quick thinking, super fast reflex guy who can HIT, Block, Dig, and Set when called upon. I am amazed by his court smarts every match.  Tony has been the MAN!!! Happy Birthday Tony April 13th…..
deserves Player of the Year. Tony has grown into a super on-and off court LEADER, as well as being an awesome HITTER.  God willing, we will advance to the Final Four and Capture the NCAA at Galen on Cinco de Mayo…[I will be sitting in 116-row 1-seat 7] come by and say hello….lets DANCE!!!
We should all cross Figueroa and cheer on this Magnificent  team & Its head Coach Bill Ferguson,
who has resurrected our Volleyball Program and lead it to the Pinnacle of College Prowess.  Still lots of work to do….but the next 5 are all at Galen……its there for us …now lets go out and capture the Crown, always
Fight ON!!!

There doesn’t seem to be an explanation, not an adequate one anyway.
Four broadcasters — whose names were not made available — showed up to the Coliseum on a surprisingly blustery Saturday afternoon to audition for USC’s public address announcer opening. Over the four periods during the annual spring game, the quartet rotated, each sitting behind the microphone for one quarter.
But nobody knows exactly how the position became vacant to begin with.
Dennis Packer, a retired police detective since 2008, has served as the school’s PA announcer for 22 years, his voice booming throughout the 88-year-old stadium, introducing the Trojan Marching Band and signaling touchdown after touchdown.
But earlier this month, USC issued a press release on its website, stating that Saturday’s auditions were part of an “ongoing effort to update the football game day experience.”
I have no idea what that means either.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the athletic department was looking into the “possibility of a new voice to usher in the latest era of USC football.”
Because of the vagueness, I asked a school spokesman for more information. After all, 22-year employees don’t typically just disappear — not without at least saying some sort of goodbye or farewell.
My request, however, was declined.
Packer’s sudden absence has been a bit surprising for a number of fans, primarily because he was well-liked, amicable and, most of all, rather pleasant to hear on Saturdays in the fall.
His deep voice meshed almost seamlessly with USC’s “Tribute to Troy” march. His touchdown calls resonated with sold-out stadium crowds.
It should hardly come as a surprise that a number of fans, as a result, have taken Packer’s side in this ongoing ordeal. A few have created online forums supporting Packer — a Facebook group with more than 400 members titled “Save Dennis Packer” and an online petition with 95 signatures have circulated in recent weeks.
“When you talk to people, you won’t find a single person who thinks this is a good idea,” said Roy Nwaisser, commonly known as “USC Psycho” and the man who started the online petition. “One-hundred percent of the people you ask, ‘What would you think about USC getting a new announcer at the Coliseum for football,’ …  [would] tell you it’s a bad idea. They don’t like it.”
Packer, understandably, has tried to handle the situation with dignity. He isn’t bitter. He doesn’t let on that he is.
“Whether I’m there or not, I’m still a Trojan fan through and through,” Packer said Saturday night.
But no matter how recent events are spun, it remains a bizarre situation, mostly because USC officials haven’t exactly offered much of an explanation or any sort of rationale. The lack of transparency remains somewhat jarring.
The school’s initial release suggested the “likely” possibility that Packer could return in a reduced role, announcing the band’s pregame and halftime shows.
For now, though, the San Fernando Valley native is unaware of such a prospect and doesn’t expect to return to the Coliseum press box — not for the time being at least.
Packer said he received a telephone call on March 27, from Craig Kelley, the university’s associate athletic director for marketing, in which Packer was notified he would no longer be needed as the team’s PA announcer and USC was headed in a different direction.
He says he has tried to follow up with the athletic department, as his brief communication with Kelley slightly differs from the release posted online on April 2.
But his attempts have been to no avail, and he has been left to twist in the wind as a result.
“I thought that after all my service and time someone would talk to me about it,” Packer said.
Maybe we’ll eventually find out what happened. Heck, maybe Packer will too.
It’s a rather abrupt change. A change that appears unprompted.
So for now, we’ll have to wait for information and clarification. USC, for whatever reason, is keeping its cards oddly close to its vest.
“I have a lot of different emotions about it,” Packer said. “I really enjoyed the opportunity to be the announcer for USC, so [the news] was rather startling.”
He isn’t the only one startled.
 
“The 19th Hole” runs Mondays. If you would like to comment on this story, email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or comment below.
i need not give you specifics as to why but really do we think it was “just because”. not about the voice. i can and will belittle anyone who makes comments without merit. whether i disclose the info i know the fact of the matter is that there are reasons as to why. like it or not. have your opinions of not wanting him to go but dont judge without the facts. i have them…do you. PS maybe the writer should have actaully spoken to the right people. that i know he didnt do
Willy, you’re full of it.
Of course there are reasons why they’d get rid of him.  They must not have liked something they did, and they’re not idiots, I’m sure it’s something they’ve clearly documented, like any smart employer would do.
The problem is that they’re not explaining why.  All fans know is that the voice they’ve heard on Saturdays in the fall for 20 years is gone, and nobody will explain why publicly, and that’s going to tick off the fans.
Anyway, go ahead and keep patting yourself on the back on the internet for knowing such awesome insider information.  Aren’t you a special little man.
At USC we pride ourselves on tradition and do not take to change very well.  Mr. Packer’s voice echoing through the Coliseum is for many just integral to the USC experience as many traditions.  We alumni lost our minds when the athletic dept. considered changing the football team’s SOCKS or using a new gimmicky uniform.  Why are they quick to boot the voice of USC football at the Coliseum.
This is a terrible decision.  But then again, this is the same athletic department that thinks keeping Kevin O’Neill around for another year is a good idea.
This is very troubling, there is a trend as Jim Hefner has been let go as the color announcer for the USC Men’s Basketball team also no reason given
I’m a Cal fan, but even I can see that Dennis Packer is a class act and big part of the USC gameday experience.  He deserves better than this.
Dennis Packer is owed a huge apology…he has a very strong and pleasant voice that none of the people trying out had.
He adds so much to the coliseum experience.  What are they thinking in the athletic department?
This is absolutely ridiculous!
I have friend who work in athletics and there is a legitimate reason why he is no longer employed by the university.  The voice may be great if that’s what you care about only but when mistakes are continually made on the job any of us would be let go. Don’t judge until you know all the facts.
The university will not make all of the facts public. We are left with no information, thus it is impossible not to judge this decision. If you are interested in backing up the athletic department, you need to provide more support than just saying there is a “legitimate reason” for Dennis’s removal. If everyone knew this reason, they might be more inclined to agree with your perspective. Therefore, either explain what the reason was, or stop belittling Dennis’s supporters for being “judgmental”.
This is just awful.  No reason for it.  For everything the administration does right, there’s another massive mistake like this.
Excellent article. This is a rare disappointing choice by USC

Though senior quarterback Matt Barkley got the majority of the applause from the 15,515 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at the annual spring game Saturday, it was the defense that made the biggest plays of the day.
The defense, wearing white jerseys, beat the cardinal clad offense 34-27 in the annual contest that marks the end of spring practice.
Playmaker · Senior cornerback Isiah Wiley made several big plays during Saturday’s scrimmage, including a pair of interceptions off the cardinal team’s quarterbacks. He is slated to start opposite junior cornerback Nickell Robey. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
Barkley started the contest and went 23-39 with one touchdown and one interception. Redshirt sophomore running back D.J. Morgan had a 47-yard touchdown in the first quarter, but the offense was stagnant after that.
Instead, it was senior cornerback Isiah Wiley and the defense who ended up being the stars, forcing several turnovers and making play after play while constantly blanketing the receivers.
“He came out today. He came out big time today,” junior cornerback Nickell Robey said of Wiley.
Robey said the reason the defense shined Saturday was because of veteran leadership and experience.
“We have a lot of older guys that take leadership [and] that have stepped up a lot,” Robey said. “The young guys … are following along, and that’s the biggest thing. That’s the key. As long as we keep that going, the sky’s the limit.”
Though this was the last official practice until August, Robey acknowledged he has a lot of work to do before summer practice opens in August.
“It’s going to be a big offseason for me,” Robey said. “I’m going to … just have everything down to a ‘T’ … game in, game out, even on my bad day, I want to have the greatest day.”
The defense scored 34 points Saturday, with each stop worth three points and each turnover worth five points.
Barkley, along with redshirt freshmen Max Wittek and Cody Kessler, took the majority of the snaps at quarterback during the game.
Though it was a game dominated by defense, a few stars shined on the offensive end.
Redshirt junior receiver De’Von Flournoy had seven catches for 69 yards and redshirt sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble led all receivers with 73 yards.
“When coach calls my number, just be ready to go pretty much,” Grimble said. “When the opportunity comes, you got to be ready to make them.”
Grimble said that one of the reasons the offense has been out of sync the past few weeks is because of injuries.
“We got a lot of guys hurt. We haven’t really got everybody together yet,” Grimble said. “But this spring was good. We got some good reps, and as long as we keep working hard, stay humble, stay focused and just look to the end of the tunnel, and just keep moving forward, things are going to be just fine.”
Grimble did not appear alarmed by the lack of firepower at the spring game and said the offense looks better than it did a year ago.
“We’re more ahead of where we were last spring,” Grimble said. “You got to focus on the small things, like little details on routes or blocking and stuff like that, and just master the small part, and the big part comes.“
The Trojans are expected to be ranked in the preseason top five when the college football polls are released in the summer, and expectations are very high for the group.
Grimble said that the pressure has not gotten to the team, and that they haven’t bought into the hype.
“Our coaches do a great job of keeping us grounded,” Grimble said. “That’s the good thing about this team, even within the team — we keep ourselves grounded … it’s not about the hype, it’s about the prep. Coach Kiffin preaches that every day. And as long as we follow that … we’ll be just fine.”
The Trojans will resume organized practice at the beginning of August.
By that time, the team will likely be able to take advantage of the new John McKay Center, which will house football offices, locker rooms and treatment facilities for the team.

USC Transportation has secured funding to create six permanent shelters for passengers to wait under.
The tram stops will provide students with a safe and comfortable location to wait for the shuttles, said Jared Ginsburg, outgoing director of campus affairs for the Undergraduate Student Government, which has been advocating for the project.
Safety · USC Transportation plans to construct six tram shelters on campus to help increase use and safety of passenger riding shuttles. - Yasamin Yeganeh | Daily Trojan
The shelters will include electronic signs with information about the arrival time for the next tram, additional lighting and a seating area, Ginsburg said.
USG supports the tram shelter project because it will improve student safety and confusion about riding the shuttles, Ginsburg said.
“We have found that students are often unclear as to where to wait for the next tram, what the schedules of shuttles currently [are] and more generally, the overall safety of waiting in a dark area at night,” Ginsburg said.
Ginsburg said the project is slated for completion on Oct. 2.
The funding for the tram shelters will be divided between USC and advertising company MSS Media. MSS Media will pay for the shelters and USC will pay for the installation.
Michael Cowan, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said the shelters will make it easier to ride the tram.
“This is beneficial for students because it’s convenient to know when the next tram will arrive,” Cowan said. “Also, a tram shelter will create a more welcoming environment for students to use campus transportation.”
Joe Huang, a junior majoring in communication, said the shelters will increase tram usage.
“Some students might be more inclined to use [the shuttle] if the shelters were built,” Huang said.
Ginsburg said the tram system will be easier to use and enhance safety.
“I’m sure the addition of tram shelters will make using the trams easier, but the most important part of the addition of tram shelters is the safety aspect,” he said.
Sounds great! Thank you USC and MSS Media :-)

Monday marks the beginning of USC Earth Week, a weeklong event sponsored by the Office of Sustainability to raise awareness about the environment leading up to Earth Day on April 22.
“The focus of Earth Week this year is to engage people and enable them,” said Sustainability Program Manager Halli Bovia. “We’re trying to not only get them engaged and interested in talking about the topics, but give them the tools to enact change in their personal lives and maybe on campus, as well as the region and maybe the world.”
Events include a clothing swap, yoga in the park, a film screening and One World Café, a forum on sustainability.
Sydney Morical, a senior majoring in environmental studies and gender studies who coordinated Earth Week, said she wants the weeklong celebration to facilitate dialogue on sustainability.
“The intention behind the week is not to dump more programming on an overly entertained student body, but rather to create an engaging, impactful dialogue, showcasing different facets of sustainability,” Morical said. “Most of all, I want students to walk away with new perspectives and goals of how they will act differently to enact a positive environmental impact.”
Jonathan Cousimano, a senior majoring in political science, said it’s important for the university to promote a sustainable lifestyle.
“I try to use renewable resources such as canvas shopping bags, but I’m sure that I could do more than just put my trash in the right receptacle,” Cousimano said. “The university should help teach us ways we can do more because we’re responsible for our planet.”
Christine Archer, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and psychology, said she has her reservations about Earth Week being a product of pop culture.
“The whole green movement has become such a fad that it’s hard to decide if it’s genuine,” Archer said. “The challenge for USC Earth Week is to inspire students to see past the hybrid cars and canvas bags that celebrities promote.”
The Office of Sustainability’s series of events targets a fun and educational way for students to learn more about the cause and motivate students to act, Bovia said.
“I’m really hoping this Earth Week will raise awareness for USC students on environmental issues and help them realize there are a lot of places they can get involved,” Bovia said.
The Office of Sustainability also runs an urban garden on Shrine Place that is available to students, faculty and the community.
“We’re in an urban jungle and there’s actually a big disconnect for people between where they think their food comes from and where it actually comes from,” Bovia said. “Helping build that connection back will help reconnect them to being more self-sufficient with food. We’re hoping it’ll help build healthier lifestyles.”
Bovia said students can have a positive impact on the global environment by making local changes.
“There’s a phrase that I really like and it’s ‘think globally, act locally,’” Bovia said. “You need to think about your impact globally, but you can focus your actions locally. Especially with USC being such a global institution, this is really not a stretch.”

The university and the Los Angeles Police Department held a press conference Friday afternoon to encourage public help in finding the suspect or suspects responsible for the deaths of two graduate students shot dead early Wednesday morning. Officials also used the press conference to officially announce a $125,000 reward, funded by USC, for information leading to a suspect’s arrest and conviction.
Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students Ming Qu and Ying Wu were fatally shot while sitting in Qu’s car near the intersection of Raymond Avenue and 27th Street.
Global · Chen Zhumin, head of the education office for the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles, spoke to the press Friday. - Otto Hsiao | Daily Trojan
LAPD Deputy Chief Pat Gannon said detectives will work in the same fashion that they do to solve all murders, but they also need the public’s help.
“A successful resolution to this case will only happen with the help of the public,” Gannon said.
The FBI and the LAPD Operation Save Our Streets II Joint Task Force are assigned to the investigation.
The possible suspect was last seen wearing dark clothes running southbound on Raymond Avenue at about the same time a black sedan was leaving the area. The race and gender of the suspect are unknown.
Gannon noted that the rainy weather at the press conference was similar to the weather during the morning of the murder.
“[The rain] is exactly like the weather that evening, if there is any symbolism to that,” Gannon said.
The area near the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue, where the crime took place, has seen a decrease in crime in the past few years, Gannon said. Violent crime is down 50 percent in the last five years.
“This is a great neighborhood,” Gannon said. “This is a great community. We’ve had a total of three murders in the last five years.”
Jacqueline Hamilton, Wu’s host mother since June 2011, said Wu was a determined young woman. She spent a lot of time at the library and enjoyed cooking.
“She was a member of our family,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton said she doesn’t know if Wu and Qu were dating, but Wu and Qu saw each other frequently and had developed a close relationship.
“I’ve never seen Ying happier than in the last three weeks,” Hamilton said. “They were at that stage in their relationship where they couldn’t bear to be apart.”
Chen Zhumin, head of the education office for the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in Los Angeles, said he hopes USC’s award will help catch the suspect or suspects.
“We are very grateful that USC is offering this award for information about the suspect and we appreciate the efforts made by LAPD to track down the suspect,” Zhumin said. “We hope that with this award more information will be gathered, hopefully before the parents arrive because the more information we can give to the parents, the better. And more importantly, I think with the help of the public and also the Chinese consulate, LAPD will get [the] suspect soon and bring him to justice.”

Community members and graduate students of the Viterbi School of Engineering gathered in the Seeley G. Mudd Building on Friday to mourn the loss of Ying Wu and Ming Qu, who were fatally shot Wednesday morning on the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue.
USC administrators and members of the Los Angeles Police Department addressed questions ranging from safety concerns to community healing at a town hall-style meeting.
Wanted · The Los Angeles Police Department announced USC will offer a $125,000 reward for information on the murder of two graduate students. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Yannis C. Yortsos, dean of Viterbi, said it was the most tragic event to occur within the Viterbi community.
“[The shooting] was an unprecedented event in our history,” Yortsos said. “I’ve been with USC since 1979, and I don’t remember an event of this magnitude.”
Yortsos said it is hard for students to comprehend the death of Wu and Qu, who were graduate students studying electrical enginnering.
“We engineers are very analytical,” Yortsos said. “We are people who want to know why things happen. When we are confronted with this unexplainable, atrocious event, we are unable to comprehend how these two young people, full of life, that came from across the oceans to explore the worlds, have been taken away from us. It is something that we simply do not have the capacity to understand.”
Wu’s and Qu’s deaths should be seen as a call for the Viterbi community to improve the world, Yortsos said.
“We should move a step up and see how, with our capacity, with our commitment, with our enthusiasm, with our talent, how we can make the world a better place,” Yortsos said. “This is an important challenge for us. This is a debt that we owe to the memory of Ming and Ying.”
LAPD Deputy Chief Pat Gannon said though safety has improved west of campus, it is important the USC community remains aware.
“The area [around USC] has changed dramatically and even though it is safer, it still has a variety of challenges,” Gannon said. “You always, always have to be careful — even in the safest areas of Los Angeles. Make sure you’re aware of your surroundings, make sure you know where you’re going, make sure your cell phone is charged.”
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said that students should not view this one incident as indicative of a bad neighborhood.
“The neighborhoods surrounding USC are safe,” Carlisle said. “We have seen decreases in crime consecutively each year, for the 5 1/2 years that I’ve worked here. Do not judge our neighborhoods by one act of violent crime.”
Denzil Suite, associate vice president for student affairs, said that the university has a plan to increase housing opportunities to graduate students by adding 3,120 beds to The Village at USC for graduate students.
Derek Zhou, a former Viterbi graduate student, said losing a child can be especially stressful for Chinese parents because of the country’s one-child policy.
“I didn’t even tell my parents about the shooting,” Zhou said. “Most Chinese parents only have one child and if they lose their child, they’ve lost everything. It’s a loss that you can only imagine.”
USC needs to petition L.A to clean out the rubbish from the area-send the Army and have them go door to door. Its obvious who are the criminals in the are.
“Wu’s and Qu’s deaths should be seen as a call for the Viterbi community to improve the world, Yortsos said.” 
What utter nonsense! 
I wish USC would stop the self-serving sugarcoating of the tragedy. 
2 students died needlessly in a crime is a call for USC to improve the safety of its students and the local neighborhood!!!
I’m from L.A. and I think USC wants to give people who don’t know L.A. a false impression that the neighborhood it’s located in is as safe as the rest of L.A.. 
But in fact USC is located in one of the most dangerous part of L.A.
For comparison, the part of of L.A that I live in is called Racho Palos Verdes. It has about 41,000 residents, so roughly the same as the USC population.
Over the last 5 years, there have been a total of 3 killings in my town: http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/rancho-palos-verdes/
During the same time frame, in the 2 mile neighborhood of USC, there has been 99 killings: http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/search/?address=2700%20Raymond%20Ave,%20Los%20Angeles,%20CA%2090007,%20USA&lat=34.0309102&lng=-118.2980541&g=Geocodify.
The crime statistics show that you’re 33 times more likely to be murdered in the USC neighborhood vs RPV!
I think it’s time that USC stop hiding the truth about the danger of living around the USC neighborhood so that innocent and probably naive prospective students won’t be lulled into a false sense of security should they decide to enroll at USC.
Otherwise, USC has blood on it’s hands!
Terry-What a stupid comparision; Ranch PV versus the in inner city LA. Try living down below in Carson, Gardena, Compton where most people are. Not everyone is as lucky as you to live on the hill. For where you live, why even three killings!
Brian, 
I think Terry’s point is valid – some parts of L.A. is safe while other parts of L.A. is definitely not. 
USC has always try to portray itself to the world outside as having crime problems that is typical of the city of L.A.. 
But L.A. locals know that USC is in fact located next to a very dangerous part of L.A.
You’re right in that the USC’s neighborhood is far more dangerous than safe parts of L.A. such as Rancho Palos Verdes that Terry mentioned and is more similar to other tough parts of L.A. such as Carson, Gardena, and Compton.
But did you know that the USC’s neighborhood is actually even more dangerous than those tough towns that you mentioned?
For example, Carson, one of bad parts of L.A. that you mentioned, with a population of 90,000 people (double the population of USC), has only 38 killings in the last 5 years: http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/carson/
Gardena, another bad part of L.A. that you mentioned, with a population of 58,000, has only 21 killings in the last 5 years: http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/gardena/
Even a terrible part of L.A. such as Compton that you mentioned, with a population of 94,000, has less killing on a per capita basis with 159 killings in the last 5 years: http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/neighborhood/compton/
As you can see Brian, the USC neighborhood is even more deadly than even those tough parts of L.A. that you mentioned!
Rancho Palos Verdes is a very nice place. 
I guess that’s why lucky people like Terry and USC president Nikias chose to live there instead of living in the “safe” neighborhood next to USC like the rest of us poor USC students!
USC should stop giving outside world the false impression that the neighborhood is safe. 
Just because the neighborhood crime rate went down does NOT mean that area is safe.
The truth is the neighborhood merely went from terrible to bad!
A current USC student posted in a another article that USC has already sent out robbery alerts to students that average to about a robbery once a month this year!
These 2 victims had been studying in the library and the guy was dropping the girl off at her house. He was double parked and had his engine running when someone approached the car and shot them to death.
USC’s advice of knowing where you are/making sure you know where you’re going/having your cell phone charged would have made no difference in the case whatsoever!
A robbery once a month? Do you realize how few that is in a community of over 40,000 people?
I look forward to seeing Viterbi’s response; the families deserve  nothing less

This week, the USC community mourned the death of two graduate students, Ying Wu and Ming Qu, after a fatal shooting in the area west of USC’s campus. There was no denying that a dark cloud hung over campus.
Grieving is a natural process that most of us have been through at some point in our lives.
Still, people might not be aware of the potential long-term physical and mental effects of violence that hits so close to home.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
USC needs to take a stand and assure current and incoming students that it has their health in mind.
This assurance should take the form of better off-campus safety measures as well as more visible on-campus health services.
According to Human Impact Partners, neighborhood crime causes feelings of fear and insecurity.
In a study from Greenwhich, London, participants who said they were afraid to leave their homes during the day were “64 [percent] more likely to be in the lowest quartile of mental health.”
Another study at the New York Academy of Medicine found that women who witnessed violent acts in their neighborhood were twice as likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety.
People who live in neighborhoods where they fear for their safety are more likely to experience myriad physical ailments, too. Obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure are common problems for people living in violent areas.
In reality, the USC area is not necessarily more or less unsafe than other parts of Los Angeles — and the shooting last week is more of an anomaly than a common occurrence.
But what counts most is how people perceive their environment.
Students who need to worry about studying for their final might not feel safe staying on campus late at night, knowing that Campus Cruiser stops providing cars at 2:45 a.m.
How comfortable USC students feel in and around campus has a direct impact on their schoolwork, health and social interactions.
As recently accepted students debate between USC and other universities, one has to wonder: How is USC going to assure students and parents that the surrounding neighborhood is safe?
Though there is no way to guarantee that an event like this will never happen again, increasing the number and hours of the CSC security ambassadors, increasing Campus Cruiser hours of operation and installing more lighting and security cameras on the streets surrounding USC are all means by which USC could increase security, along with the confidence USC students have in their safety.
Ensuring that students have peace of mind in their neighborhoods is important. Many students live on the west side for cheaper housing options, and they should not have to sacrifice their safety or comfort simply because they can’t afford to live elsewhere.
USC needs to realize that neighborhood safety is also important in the context of the greater student body’s mental and physical health. The impact of violence in a neighborhood goes beyond the first few weeks.

God i freakin hate this column. Literally the epitome of redundancy week in and week out. DT & New Editor in Chief, please fix the opinion section next semester. It’s been horrible this spring. The columns lack originality and have nothing new to say. Really over it…
Thank you for pointing out the airheadedness of these Op-Eds…what the hell is this article saying? How many patrolman would make you feel safe to the point your health is stabilized? 
Are there any students attending USC that is not used to the protective cocoon of Mommy and Daddy’s house?

On Wednesday, graduate students Ying Wu and Ming Qu were fatally shot in front of Wu’s residence west of campus.
The university has delivered a heartwarming response to the shooting. But varying community responses have also highlighted campus divisions. Wu and Qu were international students from China — and that fact has received more attention than it deserves.
The response should not be about race, wealth or country of origin.
As we cope with the aftermath, we can’t lose sight of the fact that the shooting isn’t just a tragedy for the international student community: It’s a tragedy for the entire Trojan Family.
As of 2011, USC had 8,615 international students. About 2,500 of those students are from China. The group’s size is a source of pride for the administration, but it also makes the formation of separate communities within USC more likely.
For one, the majority of students who attended the vigil were Asian. Word about the vigil circulated through social media, including RenRen.com, a Facebook-like social network based in China. Many students who did not attend said they simply didn’t hear about the vigil soon enough.
Further highlighting the divide, the media has repeatedly framed the incident in terms of nationality. On Thursday, LA Weekly reported that a Chinese media outlet blamed the shooting on the students’ supposed display of wealth. (The Daily Trojan initially reported that Qu drove a late-model BMW. Later sources clarified that the car was a used 2003 BMW.) Neon Tommy published an article about the vigil titled “USC Shooting Brings Together Divided Asian Community.” The headline seemed to suggest that the shooting was an event to be mourned largely by Asian students.
Finally, some students have claimed that Wu and Qu became victims because, as international students, they had a poor understanding of safety in Los Angeles. One comment on the Daily Trojan website said that “international [students] should . . . make an effort to assimilate with their native U.S. classmates.”
This line of thinking might allay the fears of non-international students, but it disregards the fact that, as second-year Viterbi graduate students, Wu and Qu were hardly naïve newcomers. Moreover, throngs of students — students of all backgrounds — walk, bike and drive home from Leavey Library in the early hours of the morning.
What happened to Wu and Qu could have happened to anyone. Their plight is our plight.
 
Staff editorials are determined by the senior editorial board. Its members include Maya Itah, Melissa Caskey, Sean Fitz-Gerald and Giovanni Osorio.
I understand what the authors are saying but I wonder if these editors would have the same courage to say this about the Trayvon Martin case. The Trayvon shooting case has received way too much media attention with the heavy emphasis on racial overtones. Will the editors speak out that the Trayvon/Zimmerman case needs to stop talking about race?

Venice Boulevard, one of the busiest streets in Los Angeles, houses a flurry of restaurants, retail space and other attractions. But one place that’s under the radar for even native Angelenos is a museum dedicated to a mostly unexplored era.
The Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City offers a quirky look at unusual historical artifacts and relics, many of which feature “curious technological qualities.” The museum contains pieces from a permanent collection and each section of the space centers around a theme. The locale does not charge an admission fee but suggests a donation of $3 for students and $5 as a general fee.
Haven · The Museum of Jurassic Technology offers a vast assortment of finds, including a courtyard with a central fountain and bird cages for a patron to enjoy a cup of tea and the relaxing surroundings. - Eva Recinos | Daily Trojan
When visitors first enter, they can feast their eyes on everything from the skeleton of a mole to a display exploring the history of man-made gems. Most of the displays feature buttons that trigger an auditory explanation visitors listen to through vintage phones. The museum focuses on historical events as well, such as the writing of unusual letters to Mount Wilson Observatory when it first opened.
The museum also extensively utilizes videos and creatively designed displays. The most notable of these is the section dedicated to the life of opera singer Madelena Delani. The display reveals the life of a woman who dealt with memory issues, and the room holds photographs that light up in groups as the story of her life unravels through the speakers. Glass displays also include materials like the singer’s gloves and hair pieces.
The exhibit creates an interesting atmosphere and allows museum-goers to slow down and take in the intriguing story of the singer. The Delani/Sonnabend Halls explore her story in conjunction with that of Geoffrey Sonnabend, a neurophysiologist who wrote about memory. Together, the figures’ stories create an intriguing look at memory through the ages.
Another portion of the museum, titled Lives of Perfect Creatures, reveals a room dedicated to the dogs of the Soviet space program that didn’t make it back to Earth. The walls bear reproductions of portrait paintings of the dogs, complete with a small candle in front of Laika, the first to travel to space but also first to die from the voyage. The paintings seem eerie in a certain light but keep alive the memories of dogs that we might not even think about today in an era where space travel looks less fantastical.
The next room reveals a small theater with various videos rotating throughout the day. Visitors can walk into the quaint space and pick up a pair of glasses, which make the images on the screen semi-3-D. A small sign near the back indicates viewers to ask a tearoom assistant for help with the videos.
The tearoom proves a good spot for relaxation, meditation and any other forms of mental decompression. The room’s low doorway, soft white curtains, candles and vases with flowers create a bright, mellow atmosphere very different from the rest of the museum. A friendly employee serves visitors tea and a small table holds cookies for visitors. The tea comes at no charge but a small bucket sits on the table for any generous visitors willing to tip.
A small flight of stairs leads tea-sippers to a small courtyard with large white material draped over the top, revealing bits of sky. The area, decorated with birds in cages, offers more seating to visitors. A small fountain decorates the center of the courtyard, and an arched doorway leads to a room with a long cage filled with even more birds. The entire area ends the visit to the museum but still invites the visitor to linger.
On the way out, you can also purchase trinkets from the museum’s gift shop. Contrary to the usual gift shops that hawk shirts and mugs emblazoned with a museum’s name or logo, the Museum of Jurassic Technology offers more than such overt souvenirs.
Kooky items, such as a music box that creates tunes with holes visitors punch in and commemorative matchboxes dedicated to the Soviet space program’s dogs, line the shelves and add a touch of curiosity and amusement to the end of the experience.
In the end, visitors can leave with new morsels of information and perhaps a new fascination with the past — but definitely a new area to sit and have a cup of tea.

The marketing campaign for The Cabin in the Woods wants to make potential audiences aware of one thing: This is not simply a movie about a cabin in the woods. To go into much more detail than that, insist the creative forces behind the film, would be revealing too much. In the interests of keeping things vague: Five college-age friends decide to take a trip to the scenic cabin one of their cousins recently acquired.
Challenge accepted · Kristen Connolly (above) stars as the likable and innocent Dana in The Cabin in the Woods, Drew Goddard’s horror flick that plays with the tried and true themes and motifs of the genre. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Entertainment
All the standbys of the genre are proudly represented. There’s the promiscuous blonde (Anna Hutchison), her meathead boyfriend (Chris Hemsworth, before he was Thor), the less boisterous smart guy (Jesse Williams), the likable, innocent girl (Kristen Connolly) and the comic relief stoner (Fran Kranz). If they sound like they could be the cast of any horror movie, well, that’s by design — and not in the way one might think.
Cabin in the Woods is a feast for the pop-culture savvy, a bold and ridiculous deconstruction of its genre. What is horror anyway? Why do audiences line up again and again to see the same stock characters brutally murdered for their sexuality, their drug use or for being too clever?
Oh sure, that’s not what literally happens. There’s a cursed book, or a prank gone wrong or a mystical conch shell of the damned that the teens stumble upon and before they know it, some force of nightmare emerges to exact its revenge. But that’s all metaphor, isn’t it? In these sorts of movies, we know the girl is doomed the moment she takes her top off, whether or not the zombies, vampires or gargoyles have even bothered to show up.
The way our culture repeats these tropes — ad nauseam — without audiences ever really growing tired of them can feel like a ritual. Why is that? What would happen if horror just tried something new for once? At the risk of saying too much, The Cabin in the Woods is a meditation on all these ideas. It confronts the horror genre head on, seeking out a possible reason for the patterns found in our media. It goes so far as to propose an explanation.
This is not a film with one big twist at the end. In fact, by the time the title (hilariously) appears on-screen, viewers who have really paid attention might have a pretty good idea where the movie is headed. The opening scene doesn’t appear to have anything to do with some teens off for a weekend getaway. Just a few very average-looking people getting ready for the daily minutiae of some sort of office job. But really listen to what they’re saying. That discussion, paired with the first few gory images that precede it, tells viewers a lot of what they need to know.
But even then it won’t be long before the premise is more or less revealed to the audience. This movie doesn’t have a big twist; it has an iceberg. It reveals the tip right away. As the story progresses, viewers simply get a better idea of how much mass is below the surface.
For the first hour or so, The Cabin in the Woods is a very clever look at what goes into creating horror. Fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased that the script he penned, along with director Drew Goddard, is much more witty than bone-chilling. The five young actors play their parts well, both their dialogue and performances add depth to characters that might be tempting to immediately write off as stereotypes.
Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are also phenomenal as the office workers — hybrids of studio executives and NASA mission controllers — who draw laughs with a tongue-in-cheek approach that’s endearing one minute and disturbingly callous the next.
There’s a point toward the end of the second half when it feels like the film has said all it’s needed to say. That maybe the film will be satisfied by offering a few scares and calling it a day.
Then come the last 30 minutes: a grandiose ballet of visceral insanity where everything comes to a deeply satisfying head that ties it all together brilliantly. There’s a glaring missing piece in the plot or two, and filmgoers seeking out typical, simple scares might be disappointed by the emphases on comedy and self-reflection. But for true horror fans and anyone looking for something fresh or different, The Cabin in the Woods is a bloody slice of nirvana.
I watched this a couple of times, and still enjoyed it haha
