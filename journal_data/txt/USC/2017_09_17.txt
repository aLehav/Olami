For much of regulation, what was hyped as a rematch for the ages between No. 4 USC and Texas didn’t live up to its billing.
But a furious finish in the fourth quarter, capped off by a 27-24 USC win in double overtime, made the wait worth it for the 84,714 fans who filled the Coliseum on Saturday.
“Credit to [head coach Tom] Herman,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I have respect for him and Texas. I’m so glad we caught them early in the season because that team is going to be really, really good.”
With the game tied 24-24 in the second overtime, junior cornerback Ajene Harris recovered a fumble — his second of the game — giving USC the ball. And freshman placekicker Chase McGrath delivered a game-winning 43-yard field goal to give USC the win.
“I kind of think it’s funny because it gives me more time to lock in and stay warm,” McGrath said about being “iced” before his game-winning kick. “It felt really solid coming off my foot. Once I looked up and saw it go through the upright, I was excited.”
In the first overtime, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold fired a strike to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett on the very first play to give the Trojans a 24-17 lead. Texas, however, answered when quarterback Sam Ehlinger converted on third down and then on first-and-goal found tight end Cade Brewer to even the score.
For much of the first two quarters of Saturday’s clash with Texas, USC struggled to gain separation. And it nearly cost them, as Texas marched down the field in the final minutes of the fourth quarter to grab the lead with under a minute left.
With USC ahead by four in the final minutes, Ehlinger found wide receiver Collin Johnson on a 47-yard strike that set up the Longhorns inside the USC 30-yard line. Then, on a fourth-and-10 play, Ehlinger connected with Armanti Foreman in the back of the end zone to give Texas the lead with 45 seconds to play.
But the Trojans answered. Darnold marched USC down the field in rapid fashion, finding Burnett, freshman running back Stephen Carr and redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. and setting up a 31-yard field goal by McGrath to force overtime.
“I don’t think I’ll ever forget in my life, the best two-minute drive I’ve ever been associated with,” Helton said. “Having to go that far in that little of time, you hope for perfect execution and that’s what you got.”
While both offenses had a difficult time scoring points over the first two quarters, during the last three minutes of the first half, the game opened up in dynamic fashion. With the Trojans deep in Texas territory facing third-and-two, Darnold scrambled outside the pocket to his right and launched a 15-yard pass to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett, who made a leaping grab in the back edge of the end zone. USC had drawn first blood, scoring the game’s first points on the touchdown.
Texas quickly responded with a highlight reel catch of its own, as Johnson made a 28-yard catch with junior cornerback Iman Marshall draped all over him. But three straight sacks (two for junior linebacker Porter Gustin, one for redshirt sophomore linebacker Christian Rector), placed all the momentum in USC’s favor as the Coliseum crowd came unglued. Gustin entered Saturday as a game-time decision, as he underwent surgery for a broken toe on Wednesday. He had four tackles and two sacks in the first half alone, although he did not play in the second half due to a bicep injury.
The momentum shift would not last long, however. With less than a minute to go in the first half, Darnold fired a pass to redshirt junior wide receiver Jalen Greene, who dropped it. As the ball bounced off his hands, Texas cornerback DeShon Elliot stood in perfect position, intercepting it and taking it to the house for a 38-yard pick-six. It seemed like the game would remain tied at 7-7 apiece entering the second half, but this was no conventional game. With five seconds left at their own 38-yard line, Darnold threw short of the end zone to Jones at around the 20. Facing an army of defenders, Jones broke a pair of tackles, then changed direction, racing into the corner of the end zone and completing a 56-yard touchdown catch aided by a key block from Mitchell. USC led 14-7 heading into halftime.
“It was supposed be a Hail Mary,” Mitchell said. “Sam just dumped it down. Once I saw the defender, I knew if I got that block then Ronald would score.”
Texas would respond with a field goal on the first drive of the second half and the game stayed deadlocked at 14-10 for the rest of the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, Darnold made a critical mistake on third down, overthrowing a pass to junior tight end Tyler Petite that floated into Elliot’s hands. USC’s hopes looked bleak as Texas now held possession deep in USC territory, but the Trojan defense once again bailed the team out, as junior safety Marvell Tell jumped a route on third down diving for a key interception, his second of the season.
“Anything the offense does we feed off of,” senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu said. “We knew we couldn’t let them down. We practiced hard all week. We just had to play for each other.”
After the Texas turnover, Darnold threw a strike over the middle to Burnett, who escaped defenders for a big 22-yard gain. Burnett finished with 123 yards and two touchdowns, his fourth straight 100-yard game dating back to the Rose Bowl.
For the Longhorns, Ehlinger got the nod at quarterback over incumbent Shane Buechele. He began his second career start with a bang, launching a 50-yard pass on his first attempt. Although he had his struggles, turning the ball over on two straight possessions in the first quarter (on a Jack Jones interception and Rector fumble recovery), the true freshman shined late in the game.
Not sure what game the author was watching to say that the rematch had not lived up to its billing until overtime – the entire game was well played by both teams and the final moments were classic!  Congrats to a fine USC team and program, we at UT look forward to doing it again soon!  Until then, best of luck!

This past weekend at the Maryland Challenge, the women’s volleyball team improved its record to 8-3 with a four-set victory over Oklahoma (25-19, 23-25, 25-20, 25-20).  The Trojans were ranked 18th when entering the match, whereas Oklahoma was unranked.
Against Oklahoma, the Trojan offense experimented with a new player in the mix: sophomore opposite hitter Daley Krage, who had a breakout performance, putting down a career-high 12 kills.  Krage also contributed two blocks and three digs for the Trojan defense.
Another Trojan adding a feat to her career records was senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley. 
Meyer-Whalley recorded her first double-double match this season with 24 assists and 11 digs.  This is Meyer-Whalley’s 10th double-double in her career.
Leading the Trojans in kills was sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who tallied 22.  Lanier also played great defense with nine digs, which was one short of earning her a double-double on the match.  Another standout offensive performance came from senior opposite hitter Brittany Abercrombie, who delivered a career-high 16 kills alongside her two blocks.
The win against Oklahoma was essential for the Trojans, especially after losing to Maryland earlier in the tournament. USC enters
Pac-12 play against crosstown rival No. 13 UCLA on Wednesday.  UCLA will be ready to compete against the Trojans, considering UCLA’s only two losses are both to a strong Nebraska team.
“Even though we lost to Maryland, we beat Oklahoma, which was a big win for us,” senior middle blocker Danielle Geiger said.  “We learned a lot from our loss against Maryland, and then we had Daley come in and do a great job [for] us.  She’ll be a component to our success this season and I’m looking forward to Pac-12 play.”

All week long, we heard the narrative, the hype, the history — all about this vaunted “rematch” between No. 4 USC and Texas.
Never mind that it had been more than a decade since that infamous Rose Bowl game. Never mind that most of the players in Saturday’s game weren’t yet teenagers when Vince Young scampered in for that back-breaking touchdown to win the 2006 national championship. Never mind that USC is a playoff contender while Texas isn’t even ranked.
None of that mattered to FOX, the network broadcasting Saturday’s matchup, which showed countless promos and flashbacks featuring that game. Or to either USC or Texas, both of which brought out their stars to Los Angeles. Matt Leinart. Vince Young. Matthew McConaughey.
OK, one of those three didn’t play in that 2006 game. But randomly seeing the movie star and Longhorns supporter on the sidelines was quite a scene. And it very much contributed to the game’s buildup.
“We tried to settle [the hype] down, but it kept coming back — TV commercials and everything like that,” redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins said. “It’s not like we don’t see those things. They always want to make that a big part of the game. They brought all their players back. We brought all our players back. They had celebrities on their sideline. We had celebrities on our sideline.”
Concocting storylines in sports, though, rarely works out. Yes, this was a matchup between two storied programs that once combined for one of the greatest college football games ever. And yes, this is what probably drew over 84,000 fans to the Coliseum on Saturday.
But it wasn’t what made the game special. Nobody is going to compare Saturday’s game to the 2006 Rose Bowl and argue that it was just as good, or that USC had “redeemed” itself in some way — because it didn’t. This USC team is not out to avenge the sorrows of the 2005 team; rather, it is trying to pave its own legacy, its own chapter of greatness. And Saturday’s thrilling double-overtime win over Texas that took every ounce of energy this team could muster was proof it doesn’t need to live in the glory days of the past to be a force in the present.
“We knew [the game] was important to our fanbase, but it was 12 years ago,” head coach Clay Helton said. “To a lot of these kids, they were just 6 years old. It was more important for us, for our season.”
Because let’s be honest: If this was truly a rematch of that epic game, then both teams’ first half performances were an insult to everything that the 2006 Rose Bowl represented. Nobody could convert on fourth down. There were fumbles and interceptions and pick-sixes and missed field goals and dropped catches and punts — lots of punts. It was an ugly game, a snooze-fest until the first points finally came with five minutes left in the second quarter, and then again in the second half until redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold came to life late in the fourth quarter and overtime and added to his legend at USC.
Here’s what made this game special. It was the fact that USC overcame a hungry and feisty Texas team led by a head coach in Tom Herman, who entered the game 6-0 all-time against ranked opponents. It was the fact that USC found a way to win despite having no run game whatsoever and with Darnold MIA for a majority of regulation. It was the fact that, in a game in which USC could have easily seen its hype train careen off the rails, the Trojans stayed poised and patient, and hung in there despite not bringing their A-game.
“In the middle of the second quarter, I was like, ‘Dang. This Texas defense really has our number, to be honest,’” Darnold said.
And it did. To watch a dynamic talent in Darnold and a deadly 1-2 running back punch in junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr all sputter was frustrating, and the longer the struggles carried on, the more the thought that Texas could pull the upset crept into everyone’s head.
The Longhorns, in fact, were 45 seconds away from doing so. They had already achieved their version of the Vince Young “he’s-going-for-the-corner” play when quarterback Sam Ehlinger found Armanti Foreman in the end zone to give Texas a 17-14 lead late in the fourth quarter.
But this time, there would be no regrets for USC, no failed Reggie Bush lateral or Pete Carroll not putting Bush on the field on fourth-and-two. This time, there was only Darnold, with the game — and national championship hopes on the line — marching the Trojans down the field, throwing one clutch strike after another: a miraculous jump pass to Carr, a money throw to redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. that set up the game-tying field goal to force overtime as the Coliseum went delirious.
 “I don’t think I’ll ever forget in my life, the best two-minute drive I’ve ever been associated with,” Helton said.
 And then the touchdown bullet to junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett on the first play of overtime, the strip by redshirt sophomore linebacker Christian Rector in double-overtime, the game-winning field goal by walk-on freshman placekicker Chase McGrath that conjured up 2017 Rose Bowl flashbacks — pure ecstasy, even a bit of numbness wondering what the hell you just watched.
 So, perhaps there was something in this game for everyone. For the old-timers, there was the sense of satisfaction of finally beating Texas. For the newer crowd, there was a thrilling win, a gritty performance and a massive sigh of relief. But most importantly, for the players, it didn’t matter.
 “It’s a win,” Darnold said. “I don’t know where it ranks.”
 It would be hard-pressed to rank any game higher than the 2006 Rose Bowl. But then again, Darnold was 8 years old at the time. Right now, the 20-year-old Darnold and his teammates are carving out their own legacy. And more than just a rematch, Saturday’s game was another step toward accomplishing what the 2005 team couldn’t do.

Earlier this month, Undergraduate Student Government unveiled a new plan to update USC student ID cards to include a comprehensive list of resources and options to steer students through crises. This plan was approved at a Senate meeting on Sept. 5.
Currently, USC student ID cards list two phone numbers: the general USC safety number — an inoperational emergency line — and USG’s phone number. USG proposed to replace these two numbers with the Department of Public Safety emergency number, and a new USC 411 number which will also function as a crisis hotline. Both of these lines are still in the making and are currently not functional.
Particularly, the 411 line represents notable progress, underscoring the urgency and importance of student mental health and wellness, and places  a strong emphasis on proactive crisis intervention. 411 is the telephone number for local directory assistance in the United States and Canada. But for USC, if a 411 line is created, it would be a general assistance line that could divert students to a crisis intervention line if needed, while also offering additional assistance. For example, the line would help direct students to more information about reporting sexual assault. 
A number of details about the line and whether it would utilize an automated operator or a human representative remain unclear. But one thing is certain: It marks a significant, positive shift toward bringing students more direct help, and knocks down barriers to finding the right phone lines and offices for students faced with urgent situations.
Recent events relating to public safety and student well-being demonstrate a need for a comprehensive platform for students to know about their options. Due to ongoing issues involving campus sexual assault rates and the nation-wide epidemic of mental health issues on college campuses, USC must invest resources to ensure that students are well equipped to handle such situations. 
USG’s proposed 411 line models the national 211 crisis line for community information and referral services. Established in July 2000, this line connects Americans to community-based organizations and government agencies to steer them through resources ranging from mental health to basic human needs. This model has trickled down to U.S. colleges as well, with California community colleges establishing a 24-hour anonymous counseling phone line for mental health emergencies.
As USG continues to roll out details of the  new system, it must take caution in how its phone line treats mental health. For example, an automated operator could run the risk of treating the issue as impersonal. Additionally, the numbers on the backs of USC cards can only do so much. With long wait times and limited counselors at the Engemann Student Health Center, students already struggle with layers of bureaucracy. 
The lack of a human voice to steer them through this search for resources could further cause them to feel like their experiences are a passing commodity to the University. Additionally, while providing the number for the Crisis Intervention Center may steer more students toward this resource, the overall availability of mental health resources on campus remains an issue in itself which a new phone line — while a step in the right direction — will not sweepingly fix.
The 411 line as well as increased visibility of crucial services mark a positive improvement to establishing connectivity and breaking down barriers to get help on campus. But this is only the first step. 
USG must continue to improve not only by informing students of the resources available to them, but also by improving the actual resources the University offers. The expansion of services like mental health counseling that are severely limited but in high demand are as important as informing students of the existence of these resources. USG is bringing visibility to an important campus issue and deserves credit for this. But more can — and must — be done.

On Sept. 11, the California legislature passed health care bill SB 17, which requires pharmaceutical companies to release critical information on how major drugs are priced. SB 17 — although not yet signed by Gov. Jerry Brown — received support from both Republicans and Democrats in the waning hours of the 2017 legislative session. Many proponents from both sides believe that the bill could revolutionize national health care policy, as it would check the power of an increasingly monopolized business.
Specifically, the measure requires that pharmaceuticals make three important pieces of information public: the 25 most commonly prescribed drugs, the 25 most costly drugs and the 25 drugs with the largest annual increase in price. In addition, SB 17 forces manufacturers to report any increase in the cost of their products at least 60 days in advance if it exceeds a certain threshold. 
Unsurprisingly, drug manufacturers are not pleased. If SB 17 goes into effect, big pharmaceutical companies would no longer have the power to raise the price of major drugs without receiving at least some kind of backlash. Public silence is what these companies feed on, allowing them to get away with limiting free enterprise and maximizing profit on their products. 
Pharmaceutical companies’ ability to take advantage of that monopoly is highlighted in a 2014 Express Script report, which states that Americans consume 80 percent of the world’s supply of opioids despite representing only 5 percent of the population. Powerful painkillers are, undoubtedly, addictive and have serious side effects, and the fact that most Americans have a full bottle stocked in their cabinets at home is not to be taken lightly. In fact, the opioid epidemic, now deemed a national emergency by the Trump administration, was responsible for 28,000 American deaths in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these fatalities were from prescribed medications.
The issue is indicative of most manufacturers’ reckless disregard for public health; knowing that doctors over-prescribe drugs without properly weaning patients off of them, pharmaceuticals have made a business out of creating potentially harmful products and selling them to consumers who likely did not need the medication in the first place. Indeed, the more money rolls in from the hordes of drug-abusing Americans, the easier it is to push ethical boundaries in the industry. Put simply, big manufacturers undermine national health care policy by shifting the focus from the well-being of American citizens to the potential profits that can be made by big business. 
The aforementioned evils of Big Pharma are personified in one formidable public enemy: Martin Shkreli. Those familiar with his name might remember him as the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer that primarily markets the drugs Daraprim and Vecamyl. In 2015, Shkreli — otherwise known as the “most hated man in America” — sparked national uproar after he raised the price of Daraprim, which treats malaria and AIDS, by over 5,000 percent. Shkreli was later arrested for fraud.
Like Shkreli, a large number of these companies do not care about meeting public health needs because they have more important things on their minds — like money. In other words, major manufacturers can sleep well at night knowing that they jeopardized the health of millions if it meant making a quick billion. And, while it is true that some pharmaceuticals may be unfairly demonized by a bad apple, the impersonality embodied by Shkreli is still largely characteristic of the direction the industry is going in. 
The California legislature should be commended for its decision to tackle pharmaceuticals like Turing during this year’s session. In addition to SB 17, lawmakers introduced measure AB 265, which cuts discounts to pricier drugs when more affordable alternatives are available. If successful, the bill would limit manufacturers’ ability to manipulate consumers by tempting them with seemingly less expensive brands. Also notable is AB 315, a bill that focuses on regulating pharmacy benefit managers, who are largely responsible for driving up the cost of prescription medication. 
Missing from the equation in these measures, however, is public knowledge of the situation — which is why SB 17 will be critical if signed into law. In matters as important as healthcare, each citizen deserves to know how his or her access to essential medication is being impacted by big pharmaceutical companies. College students, and those transitioning into a life of self-sufficiency, should be able to know much their EpiPens might cost in a few years. 
While insurers usually take much of the blow from rising drug prices, SB 17 is a step in the right direction. Our legislators cannot have informed, productive conversations with pharmaceuticals if there is not at least some level of transparency. As mentioned before, drug companies have too long been held unaccountable for the prices of their products, and measures like SB 17 are necessary checks on their power, albeit small ones.
If Brown signs this bill, perhaps other states will follow suit — and the nation can take back public health for the sake of health.

After nearly four years, a prized piece of Angeleno nostalgia has come rattling back to life in downtown Los Angeles. 
Angels Flight, the venerable old cable car funicular with vibrant orange cars, is running again from Hill Street to California Plaza at the north end of the city center.
The 116-year-old incline railway was originally designed to move people up steep Bunker Hill, home to a once-residential community that thrived at the turn of the 20th century. City urban renewal projects razed the area to make room for skyscrapers in the late 1960s.
It holds a special place in the hearts of passengers of all backgrounds, regardless of where each is from. For rider and native Angeleno Tony Petborisooth, the twin cable cars — named Olivet and Sinai — have been a fixture in the area his whole life.  
“I love it,” Petborisooth said. “It is just an iconic piece of Downtown and downtown history. I always have to come by and see it. Love to ride it.”
Los Angeles transplant and USC alumna Janna Smith, who works in the area, has the same sentiment. 
“I went on it the last time they reopened it and I was really excited for it to open again,” Smith said. “I missed it.”
From its opening  in 1901, the railway has been through multiple cycles of use and disuse on Bunker Hill, resulting in a spotty safety record. Reports said it was dismantled entirely and stored from 1969 until the mid-1990s. 
It was last decommissioned in 2013 when it derailed with one passenger aboard, according to the Los Angeles Times. That person was unhurt. 
After a long campaign to raise the necessary funding, the railway went through a complete safety and cosmetic renovation and reopened in early September.
“It’s a lot smoother than the last time I rode it,” Petborisooth said. “I remember the last time I took my nephew, he’d never been and it was really shaky. I was like, I don’t know how long this is going to go.”
The time and work have paid off. On a recent Saturday morning, crowds gathered and lines formed for those waiting to ride. For tourists, it is a quirky novelty. For residents, it is a point of pride. The cars date back to 1905 and have been meticulously refurbished. 
“It’s amazing to see how many people are passionate about seeing it up and running,” said Jessica Hurwitch, the vice president of finance at ACS Infrastructure Development, the company that operates Angels Flight. “It’s amazing. I love it. To have people tell me they rode it when [they were kids] — it’s great.” 
The entire line originally sat next to the 3rd Street tunnel, at the north end of its current block. When it was dismantled in 1969, the cars, arch and station were put in storage until social and political will were sufficient to pull them out in the ’90s, according to the railway’s website.
A commemorative plaque at the upper station dated 1952 claims Angels Flight might just be the world’s shortest incorporated railway. It is possible to take the stairs that run beside it to the plaza, and one might get there faster. But that would miss the point. 
Angels Flight is open every day, 365 days a year, from 6:45 a.m. until 10 p.m. One-way fare is $1. Stations are located at California Plaza, 350 South Grand Avenue and 351 South Hill Street.

Foo Fighters have impressed fans yet again with the band’s latest album, Concrete and Gold, which was released on Friday. This is the ninth studio album from the Grammy Award-winning and critically acclaimed rock band. Though the band released its previous album, Sonic Highways, three years ago and EP Saint Cecilia two years ago, fans were eager for new music.
Among the 11 tracks on Concrete and Gold, the singles “Run,” “The Sky Is A Neighborhood” and “The Line” have received positive feedback from fans. In June, the band released “Run” and soon after it announced the new album. 
Affirming its infamous reputation for lineup changes, Foo Fighters also announced that touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee had officially joined the band as the sixth member. The band spent most of this year writing and recording the album at Hollywood’s EastWest Studios with the iconic pop producer Greg Kurstin. Although Kurstin has worked exclusively with pop acts like Adele, Kelly Clarkson and Sia, frontman and lead singer David Grohl expressed how working together would be a fun challenge and could move the band’s sound in different directions. 
In a newsletter to fans, the band said the album “has more twists and turns than a live Senate hearing. Like a box of really loud chocolates. Hope you’re hungry.” Although the band has been making music for over 20 years, Concrete and Gold features tracks that sometimes stray away from its traditional heavy sound.
The record opens with the short and sweet “T-Shirt,” starting with the heartfelt lyrics “I don’t wanna be king / I just wanna sing love songs / Pretend there’s nothing wrong / You can sing along with me.” The soft and sweet melody provides a contrast to the typical music put out by Foo Fighters.
Just over five minutes long, “Run” entails everything that makes the classic Foo Fighters sound. Understated at the beginning, the drums and guitars come in immediately, followed by forceful vocals. With guitar riffs and a slowed-down chorus so the listener can take in Grohl’s voice, the song is similar to many of the band’s other hits. Featuring a guitar solo and alternating between fast, heavy sounds and slow, soft sounds, “Run” is a great poster song for the album. 
Differing a bit from Foo Fighters’ heavier sound, “The Sky Is A Neighborhood” features a dreamier melody throughout the song. Despite the sluggish tempo and less aggressive vocals, the song still encompasses power between the drums and guitars. 
The album features classic Foo Fighters sounds in songs like “Arrows” and “Sunday Rain,” but also has its fair share of gentler songs like “Dirty Water” and “Happily Ever After (Zero Hour).” The record also features special guests like Paul McCartney on drums in “Sunday Rain” and Justin Timberlake on backup vocals in “Make It Right.” On an album full of influences, listeners will find traces of The Beatles in many songs, a sense of Queen in “T-Shirt,” an accent of Led Zeppelin in “Make It Right” and definite Pink Floyd vibes in the closing song, “Concrete and Gold.”
There is little doubt Concrete and Gold will be a stranger to success, as Foo Fighters continuously peaks the charts. Despite a new producer and high ambitions to challenge generic conventions, Concrete and Gold sounds like a classic Foo Fighters album. The mix of slower, sweeter songs and tracks featuring Grohl’s grungy voice and heavy instrumentals gives Concrete and Gold the potential to become one of Foo Fighters’ most memorable albums in its discography.
Before embarking on a 23-date U.S. tour in October, Foo Fighters will be headlining the Cal Jam 17 Festival in San Bernardino, Calif.

Following its opening last week on Sept. 9, Ben Jones’ Newspaper at Ace Gallery remains an immersive presentation. 
All of the artwork being showcased has been created and curated particularly for the exhibit in question. Thus, more work is being added organically to the show throughout the duration of the exhibit, which is scheduled to remain on display until Oct. 21. According to the gallery, there will be another opening in early October, once all the pieces have arrived and been installed. 
Hailing from Pennsylvania, Jones currently works and lives in Los Angeles. His interests and accomplishments are reflected in the various media he has undertaken throughout his artistic career. He has and continues to explore the possibilities of zine, drawing, painting, sculpture, video, animation, comics, digital art and more. 
Jones is known primarily for founding “Paper Rad,” an art collective native to his hometown, the Cartoon Network animation Problem Solverz and the FXX show Stone Quackers. His influences are clear and diverse, ranging from the composition of Super Mario Bros. to the aesthetic of Hayao Miyazaki to the fantastical approach of Jim Henson.
Jones’ work has been on display at Ace Gallery before. Unlike his 2015 self-titled exhibition at the gallery, Newspaper forgoes effervescent neon colors and psychedelic imagery. Even so, the childlike nature that permeated his highly graphic, geometric ping pong tables and “cinema paintings” in his 2015 exhibit also underscore the work in Newspaper.Jones’ drawings, paintings and animations in this exhibition are rather underwhelming when the question at hand is his ability to render objects as they are. 
But that was not Jones’ goal in 2015 and it is not his goal now. His fantastical, Seussical acrylic ladders and boxes were not meant to seem real; they were meant to encourage the very opposite. With the pieces in Newspaper, one is equipped with the eye of a child, frozen in an animated world stuck in a state of limbo. However, Jones would be quick to refute that claim — he avoids artifice like the plague.
“I don’t believe in glorifying or examining or reflecting the relationship in what I produce,” Jones said. “That said, my work is in and of itself hopefully an expression of this loving relationship.”
Ace Gallery’s Beverly Hills location recently shut down, so all artwork from that point forward is being displayed on the second floor of the historic Desmond’s Department Store building. This exhibit in particular is being held in a showroom across the street, which is not always open to the public. 
The walls of the exhibition room are plain white, the floors an industrial gray — everything about the show seems a bit unfinished. This show places viewers in a world in between, like the sketches of characters in an animation yet to be finalized. 
Jones has expressed the importance of embracing this stage of creation, having claimed that simplicity is key to a beautiful animation, and that “color is just this whole other mess, and it was always secondary to the line drawing.” 
He has further defended the validity of sketching, claiming that he is “constantly chasing that magical, ethereal line or stroke or gesture that is half muscle memory or trance action. You get a lot of that with handwriting and with quick sketching.”
Newspaper includes pencil drawings mounted on canvas, paintings evoking the pop art of the 1960s, blocks decorated with geometric lines, pulp-like comics pasted on canvas and a large-scale animation of what appears to be the melting face of a cartoon George Washington. 
That animation, as well as his painting of a newspaper with the headline “SPINNING NEWSPAPER INJURES PRINTER,” are appropriate examples of the artist’s sense of humor.  His belief that art is not something to be planned or created, but rather something that “naturally gravitates” — which further describes his seemingly lax approach to his craft. 
Jones first learned how to animate on a Macintosh computer with his father as a child, though his mother did not want him engaging with technology by watching television. He consequently grew up with two juxtaposed philosophies of life and his artwork embraces the same duality. 
His work takes lo-fi, street-accessible, almost childlike concepts and repurposes them into highbrow art. He dabbles with forms some would perceive as fruits of a dying world and recycles them within the context of this technologically over-equipped generation. 
Like comic books, his sketches allow one to be immersed into a cartoon fantasy world, in an updated, avant-garde fashion. His creations are at once meant to be funny and pay homage to his upbringing, his generation and his passions. 
These passions, which  he describes as a “faith in color and form,” continuously take form in three dimensions. His creations are in this way more than overly worshipped aesthetic mounds — they are, within their context, bringing about a sort of inception: A world within a world within a world.

I’ve always been a fan of Taylor Swift. To be precise, I started following her in the fourth grade after “Teardrops On My Guitar” made waves on Radio Disney. And I’ve listened to every song she’s produced up until her latest hit, “… Ready For It?” 
Am I sometimes overzealous about my admiration for Taylor Swift? Yes. But is it unwarranted? Most likely not.
As melodramatic as it sounds, Swift’s music has been the soundtrack to my life for the past 10 years. In almost every situation I encountered during my formative years, there was always a song that resonated with my emotions; in a sense, she was the chicken soup for my sentimental teenage soul.
When I experienced my first real breakup, I listened to “Clean” from 1989 to remind myself that letting go would be the best way to get over heartbreak. When my parents helped me move in to USC, I listened to “Never Grow Up” from Speak Now because it was bittersweet leaving home for the first time. And when I finally fell back in love, I listened to “Begin Again” from Red because I knew I had finally moved on from the past.
While the world may now see Swift as a celebrity with a penchant for drama, my admiration for her has never wavered. She’s an incredible songwriter with a unique ability to relate to her listeners through narrative storytelling.
Take it from someone who’s followed her discography since 2007: Swift is a lyrical genius, but counterintuitively, she never leaves the biggest impact in a chorus. Rather, the focal point of any song penned by Swift is in the bridge — and it is a signature quality that elevates her among other songwriters and pop stars today. 
As with any other deeply personal song penned by Swift, the songstress creates a detailed narrative about her experiences. However, the bridges often contain the most revealing lyrics — ones that are pivotal to truly understanding Swift’s somewhat cryptic messages. 
In her 2014 single “Begin Again,” Swift writes, “And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up / But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches / Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that / For the first time, what’s past is past.” 
In this bridge, she employs a personal anecdote to let her listeners know that she’s finally moved past her previous relationship. Instead of directly saying so, she decides to tell a story — and it’s poignant moments like this that allow Swift’s listeners to empathize with her emotions.
In “Last Kiss,” Swift describes her forlorn desire to keep up with her past lover’s life by looking at his photos and asking her friends about him. Strangely, I know that this feels like, and I’m sure that many other people have felt this way when looking back on past relationships too. 
Even in less profound songs like “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift still manages to utilize her bridge as the pop banger’s lasting proclamation: that the old Taylor is dead. 
While she’s transcended genres throughout her prolific career, Swift has never deviated from the songwriting style that not only won her 10 Grammys, but also captured the hearts of millions of fans. It’s in the bridges she writes, from songs like “You Belong With Me” to “All Too Well,” that stick with every listener and remind them of her ability to make a statement with merely a short anecdote. 
I’ll admit — I’ve grown and changed a lot over the years. But Swift has been with me through it all. From facing criticism to moving to a big new city, her music has been the sonic backdrop of my life. Right now, the song on repeat is “Change” from Fearless, which came out in 2008. It’s been out for nine years, but to me, every Swift song is timeless. 
Lovers and friends may come and go, but Taylor Swift will always be there, offering sage advice and empathy in the soundtrack to my melodramatic existence.

I very much agree. I hate to admit it but it’s true.

Jonathon Xue | Daily Trojan
Aubtin Heydari does not remember much about Aug. 12. 
But, the one distinct memory that constantly resurfaces in his mind was his trip in the ambulance the afternoon of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. 
“What is your name? How old are you? What are you doing here?” the medics asked, gauging the severity of his injuries.
Heydari, a senior majoring in screenwriting, was one of people hit when 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at the Charlottesville mall, which left 19 people injured and one person dead. 
THE NIGHT BEFORE
Heydari’s hometown, Harrisonburg, Va.,  is just 45 minutes from Charlottesville. 
“For me, Charlottesville feels like another part of my town,” Heydari said. “It’s a place that’s very intimate and close to me.” 
So when Heydari heard word of the Unite the Right rally to protest the removal of Confederate monuments on Aug. 12, he knew he had to be present to counterprotest. Heydari had always been politically active — he previously attended various political protests and rallies in California.
“It wasn’t a question [to go to the rally or not],” Heydari said. “It was pretty straightforward for me.” 
On his way to Charlottesville the night before, a friend told Heydari about the torch-light rally that white nationalist groups had planned before the main protest on Saturday. He went to the University of Virginia campus to scope out the scene and met fellow student activists who had formulated a plan for the night: Create a human shield around the Thomas Jefferson statue at UVA to protest the right-wing ralliers. 
“That’s when we heard the chanting,” Heydari said. “We saw the torches start marching towards us, and somebody yelled, ‘Get around the statue. Link up!’” 
Instinctively, Heydari followed the crowd, linking arms and surrounding the statue as the Unite the Right supporters approached, chanting phrases like, “You will not replace us!” Eventually, he and his group were surrounded with no place to go. 
“When you actually have to be locked in in a circle surrounded by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, it’s a very different physical feeling than knowing you’re going to do it,” Heydari said. “It’s the most adrenaline I’ve ever experienced in my life.” 
Suddenly to his left, Heydari saw a person being punched, and the shield of counterprotesters faltered as a full-on brawl broke out. The violence only escalated from there. Torches were thrown, and Heydari was sprayed with mace, a chemical irritant, that caused him to lose his vision for several minutes.
“I felt a stinging sensation around my face,” Heydari said. “I felt it on my mouth and on my eyes.” 
He had a few minutes to leave the circle before completely losing his sight, so after seeing a brief opening, Heydari broke out, stumbled across a volunteer medic who treated his eyes and allowed him leave the scene safely.

A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE
The following day, Heydari woke up at 7:30 a.m. and gathered with counterprotest groups in Freedom Park, where the Robert E. Lee statue stood, before the Unite the Right rally began.
The groups consisted of faith leaders, local activist groups and unions who circled the entrance of the park to prevent additional white nationalist groups from entering.
As the day progressed, different groups flowed into the scene, from Black Lives Matter Richmond to the Ku Klux Klan, Heydari said. It was not long before the groups clashed, ideologically and physically, and the violence escalated. After several minutes, the police declared the gathering an unlawful demonstration as groups began to splinter off, according to Heydari.
It was then that many of the Unite the Right groups began heading toward a low-income housing project across the Charlottesville mall, which was primarily occupied by people of color, Heydari said.   
“My last memory — this is where things get hazy — we collectively agreed we were going to march there and stop them,” Heydari said. 
It was on this march from one side of the outdoor mall to the other that the car rammed into his group, killing one person, Charlottesville resident Heather Heyer.
“My next real memory is waking up in the hospital with the realization that I can’t remember,” Heydari said. 
Heydari woke up in a hospital gown and asked his friend beside him in the room if the doctors cut off his favorite pair of black pants. 
“[My friend] gets up and she goes to the board, and she draws the eighth tally under black pants, which is how many times I’ve asked about [it] without realizing,” Heydari said. “We laughed about it, because you know, you have to laugh about some things.” 
Although Heydari suffered through a period of shock and a concussion, which left his memory hazy, he only had a fractured leg and was able to return to USC on the second day of classes. 
BACK AT ’SC
“I appreciate how parts of the school have reached out to me and the services I’ve been provided and the help I’ve been given and the leniency on parts of my professors,” Heydari said. “And I appreciate the email that [Provost Michael Quick] sent [nine days after the rally] to the entire school. It humbled me.” 
Heydari received an email from Lynette Merriman, associate vice provost of campus crisis support and intervention, the day after the attacks, but he wondered what prevented USC from doing more. 
“I do think maybe that there were some more public actions [the University] could have taken,” Heydari said. 
USC was hesitant to make a public response and tried to issue an apolitical statement, instead of explicitly denouncing the event like other universities had, he explained. 
A statement of solidarity petition, generated by Heydari’s friends in the School of Cinematic Arts, gathered 750 signatures showing support for Heydari. 
“It was very impactful to me and very touching and heartwarming especially to look at it and actively see the names going on when I was sitting in the hospital,” Heydari said. “It gave me a sense of solidarity.” 
Although physically weaker than he was before the attack, Heydari is now stronger than ever and ready to continue fighting for what is right. He wants to ensure that a campus like USC does not let racism go over its head. 
“I think that’s important we understand that this is an American problem,” Heydari said. “These people showed up from all over the [United States] and when we understand that, when we understand it’s not this stereotype of what we assume racists are … that’s the only time when we’ll actually be able to do anything to stop this.” 
He also urges the USC community to understand that there is no image of racism. 
“The people who showed up at the Unite the Right rally … a lot of them came in khakis and polos,” Heydari said. “Dressed nice, in clean-cut haircuts, looking upper-middle class.” 
Heydari also expressed frustration with the way President Donald Trump responded to the attacks, particularly not condemning the driver as a terrorist. 
“What disappointed me among many things about Trump’s response to Charlottesville … was his inability to categorically say James Alex Fields Jr., the driver of the car, was a terrorist,” Heydari said. “Because I understand … as someone of Muslim, Middle Eastern heritage, that if it was someone like me in the car, it would have never been a question.” 
So he is an Antifa member, who travels around the country looking to start trouble – and trouble found him in Charlottesville. Along with his “favorite pair of black jeans”, did he also loose his favorite club when the car he was attacking (after the incident) backed over him?

Various USC student-led start-ups presented at TechDay LA, one of the largest start-up events on the West Coast last week. The event helped new entrepreneurs expand their network with various technology communities and consumers interested in their work.
“An event like TechDay LA brings firms of all sizes into a smaller atmosphere without having to have any sort of separation between,” said Lucas Huberman, a Class of 2017 alumnus. 
Huberman co-founded startup Bee Technologies, Inc., a marketing platform that aims to transcend traditional advertising strategies by using social media to connect individuals to like-minded brands. 
As the chief operations officer of the company, Huberman believes that face-to-face exposure is key to the startup’s expansion at events like TechDay LA.
“We’re obviously facing a lot of people,” he said. “In-person exposure is always a lot better than over the phone or via email. That has engagement [and] it’s something that we’re very excited about working with.” 
Tech Day LA was free and open to the public, with 12,000 attendees, 300 startups and 600 job postings. 
In addition to providing exposure to the start-up community, industry leaders also had an opportunity to engage in the tech space. Blackstone Launchpad, a campus-based entrepreneurship program with a branch at USC, was at the event. On campus, the program serves as a resource for college entrepreneurs looking to develop their ideas and offers coaching and ideation support for students. 
“We’re trying to do a celebration of the different types of entrepreneurship and startups that are coming from downtown,” said James Bottom, director of Blackstone Launchpad USC.
Blackstone Launchpad worked with Incubate USC to gather resources for startups that would represent USC at TechDay LA. This included acquiring the means to obtain the USC startups a free table at TechDay LA, saving them hundreds of dollars. This way, the student groups can focus on presenting their product to the masses.
“We were reaching out to some of our partners to see if we could secure resources for our students to have a free table at TechDay LA,” Bottom said. “Most students are trying to bootstrap their startups. Not having to come [up with] out of pocket $500 to talk about their product is always a good thing.”
David Maliglowka, who graduated from USC in 2017, believes the exposure at TechDay LA was key for his startup Drops. Drops has a charity incentive, allowing users to round up any credit card purchase and donate the extra change to a selected charity. 
“[The Drops team] thought it’d be a really great opportunity to connect with the larger entrepreneurs in Los Angeles [to] inform people about what we’re doing and try to inspire people to give back,” Maliglowka said.
Maliglowka believed presenting Drops to a diverse tech audience could mobilize them to make a difference through an easy-to-use app.
With tech companies covering a range of topics, the event provided USC startups a chance to see what is working for other companies and learn from them. 
Rustin Sotoodeh, a senior majoring in business administration, has a startup in the esports market called E-Colosseum, which attempts to engage the gaming community through customized events and tournaments in Los Angeles.
Sotoodeh attended TechDay LA to survey what is happening in the niche he operates in and how it informs other aspects of the tech community.
“I think, on the one hand, it’s an advantage for us being in the minority because then we stand out in a crowd,” Sotoodeh said. “On the other side, it will be really interesting to see what other opportunities lie in this space. [It’s] really figuring out how what we’re doing in the esports sector that provides value for other sectors at TechDay LA.”

Artistic expression and scientific study are often seen as opposing sides of academia, but the Bridge Art & Science Alliance’s pitch day aims to change that.
BASA’s pitch day, which is held every semester, gives USC students the opportunity to present projects merging art and science to obtain up to $5,000 in funding. This semester’s pitch day took place last Friday in the Temporary Research Facility.
Kella Vangsness, a master’s student studying stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, used pitch day to present her project, “Heroes of Disease.” Throughout her studies, Vangsness has examined images that demonstrate the different stages of stem cell development. This inspired Vangsness to pitch her idea to create an exhibition that would showcase stem cells drawn in pop art style. 
“I will be using this style of art to depict stem cells as our current heroes against disease,” Vangsness wrote in her presentation. “Pop art is the style that is commonly associated with superhero comics.” 
Ultimately, Vangsness wants BASA’s help to bring her art to the USC community, as BASA funding recipients will also be assigned a project liaison from the BASA team, which would help to make her display as impactful as possible.
“I want my work to be shown in an exhibition that allows people to be inspired creatively through art and science,”  Vangsness said.
She hopes that depicting stem cells in an appealing and artistic way will not only garner interest in her field, but might also guide future scientists’ approaches toward the controversial topic. 
“I researched what parts of development I would want to highlight within my art,” Vangsness said, describing how she prepared for the presentation. 
Vangsness extensively studied stem cell images in order to foster an artistic perspective on stem cell development. To determine how to make stem cells aesthetically pleasing, she researched how pop artists of the 1970s used color. 
“The colors are bold, vibrant and evoke ideas of invincibility,” Vangsness wrote in her presentation. 
Vangsness presented “Heroes of Disease” to a panel consisting of Ph.D. students, professors and BASA board members. 
“I thought it was great,”  Vangsness said. “I was expecting it to be one-on-one, but then collaborating with everyone, hearing the ideas and them helping you make your work even bigger than you thought it could be was very exciting.”
Vangsness not only hopes to have her pop art-inspired stem cells showcased in an exhibit, but she also wants to collaborate artistically with her fellow student Aabha Morey, a graduate student at Keck.
“I want to be a neurologist and I am fascinated by the human mind,” Morey said. 
Morey’s project is titled “Dimensions — Crevices of the Human Mind.”  Her project visually depicts and categorizes the different stages of the human mind and development. Morey intends to gather images, develop mathematical formulae and then use the selected images to highlight biological phenomena while also blending those images with mathematical expressions.
“I am going to work on the dimensions of the developing human mind and attribute different variables to them,” Morey said.
The final product will be printed and displayed to the USC community.
“I want people to see that math and science are more artistic than what is normally thought,” Morey said. “Art makes you think from multiple dimensions.” 
Because Morey is a physician, she is confident in her ability to translate information about the human body toward other fields. However, as math is not her expertise, Morey wants to use BASA’s network to find mathematicians who are willing to collaborate with her. 
“I will work with the mathematicians to create mathematical expressions that could define these dimensions,” Morey said.
While a lot of people view art and science as separate entities, Vangsness wants to be a conduit for the two worlds in order to break preconceived notions of both fields. She feels that BASA’s program is her best option at progressing her initiative. 
“I want to fuse my two passions together,” Vangsness said. “They’re always swirling around in my head. To have a platform to express both of my passions, while being blended, would be one of the best gifts I can give myself.”

Day N Night took place last weekend from Sept. 8-10 at Angels Stadium in Anaheim. It was quite the multicultural experience.
The Los Angeles Times describes Day N Night as a “sprawling, almost totally comprehensive hip-hop festival.” Though “comprehensive” probably refers to the hip-hop lineup, I think it’s representative of the demographic of attendees, the clothes I saw, and the mix of cultures that influenced them. L.A.’s knack for fusion really showed last weekend.

I didn’t choose to go to Day N Night because of the branding. That’s a silly reason to drop $200. However, the branding experience of the festival certainly defined it. My weekend was a cross between hip-hop/rap culture, which is historically and dominantly black culture, new wave Asian influence, and retro punk and rock culture. Outfits, songs and friend groups were all pieced together under a signature “post-cultural-ness,” unique to Los Angeles. 
In retrospect, this fusion experience is my big $200 takeaway, whether that was intentional or not. First off, the event website, merch, and graphics featured a yin-yang logo icon and Asian-esque font. I’m curious to reach out to the event planners about whether the branding of the whole event was branded with an Asian aesthetic intentionally, or if today’s hip-hop just borrows heavily from Asian and fusion subcultures and therefore the potpourri of visuals and sounds I experienced was just a by-product of the times. Rich Chigga’s set featured Zhu, anime influenced Lil Uzi Vert’s visuals, and Kendrick Lamar headlined as “Kung Fu Kenny” on Sunday night. This vibe was not limited to the show: the festival attendees were part of the spectacle.

What are staples? What are trends? Converse meets embroidery, overalls meet leopard print. We might not notice it, but the patterns and colors we put on are on loan from different time periods and cultures. The bird-stitched bra evokes an Asian embroidery that is highly trendy right now. Overalls and animal print are making a comeback. Skate shoes are classic and retro at the same time. Day N Night festival-goers are young, so it’ll be fun to find these photos again in 20 years to see if that longevity still holds true. Most things aren’t trendy forever.
The more we wear what we wear, the more we wear out their old connotations. Converse used to be a pop punk staple, but today we pair Chucks with Supreme at a hip-hop festival. And in a few years, Converse might not evoke this alternative hip-hop style either. A quirky 1992 TLC shirt might have been tacky five years ago, but again, we subvert and evolve and call it trend today. And tomorrow, maybe it’ll be off-trend again. We borrow and borrow from other music genres, reaching to other countries, raiding our parents’ teenage closets. The connotations of classics change over time. Our clothes are a reality of redux — a very comprehensive one.
Kimonos, rice hats, ’60s sunglasses, band tees and classic Vans were abound during the weekend. I regret not taking more photos. Collecting outfits has turned out to be more awkward than I imagined. But really, this column is about my own understanding of fashion and how clothes are more than just a defense against natural forces. They’re a defense against certain judgments and a proponent for others. Shirts and socks speak not only worlds, but also eras and histories. Likes and dislikes. TV shows. We might be in our thoughts, enjoying the musical spectacle. But our clothes are always talking, every day and every night.
 
Thank you for listening.
