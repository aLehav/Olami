The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, Oct. 22, and Tuesday, Oct. 23. 
Crimes against property
At 7:56 p.m. on Oct. 22, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect roller skating through campus carrying two bicycle wheels and detained him for investigation near Childs Way and McClintock Avenue. The suspect claimed that the wheels were given to him by a friend, but the officers were unable to confirm his story. The officers then confiscated the wheels,  and the suspect was released after being advised that he could claim them with proof of ownership.
at 4:44 p.m. on Oct. 22, a suspect used an unknown substance to write graffiti on the side of a non-USC male’s van at 1289 36th Place. There was no permanent damage.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:35 a.m. on Oct. 22, a non-USC female reported that she observed a suspect peering into a window of a residence adjacent to hers at 2666 Ellendale Pl. and stated that this was at least the third time she has seen him.  DPS officers responded, locating and detaining the suspect. The suspect was positively identified by the female during a field “show-up,” then was arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.

USC professor Lisa Bitel and lecturer Lynn Swartz Dodd hosted a seminar Tuesday at the Social Sciences Building that focused on the role of text, magic and tradition in the spread of religions. The event, “Haunted Religion,” featured lectures from Boston University’s David Frankfurter and UCLA’s Jacco Dieleman.
History · David Frankfurter, a professor of religion at Boston University, shared information Tuesday from a chapter of his latest research, which is tentatively titled “Christianizing Egypt: Syncretism and Local Worlds in Late Antiquity,” at an event hosted by the Center for Religion and Civic Culture. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Frankfurter, a professor of religion at BU, employed a question and answer format, which focused mainly on a chapter from his latest research, tentatively titled “Christianizing Egypt: Syncretism and Local Worlds in Late Antiquity.” Much of the discussion centered on how shrines help facilitate the combination of indigenous Egyptian religious beliefs and orthodox Christian beliefs. The event was organized by USC’s Center for Religion and Civic Culture’s Interdisciplinary Research Group.
Frankfurter captured the essence of his chapter by reading some of his writing regarding shrines and their purpose as an arena for people to experience divinity.
“Their [the shrines’] importance for the popular conceptualization of Christianity cannot be understated,” Frankfurter said. “For a religion that first spread through legends and claims of miraculous healing and dramatic exorcisms, these buildings became arenas for thaumaturgical display — for people to experience the immanence of some heroic martyr, biblical prophet or holy man.”
Dieleman, an associate professor of Egyptology at UCLA, discussed his paper “From Pharaonic to Greco-Egyptian Magic: The Case of Textual Amulets.”
In his presentation, Dieleman discussed the changing materials used in Egyptian amulet making, particularly the adoption of metal amulets before the turn of the first century.
Dieleman’s presentation also discussed the materials used to make amulets throughout time. Initially, amulets were created out of linen and papyrus. He went on to discuss the move away from these materials to metal, and how the orientation of the amulets changed.
Frankfurter explained that the combination of Christianity and indigenous religions was not unique to Egypt. Using Egypt as an example, however, is beneficial because better historical references exist in Egyptian history than in other cultures that experienced similar conversions to Christianity, he said.
Frankfurter also noted that lessons from Egypt can be applied to these other cultures where there is less documentation of historical events.
“What is peculiar about Egypt is that we have better documentation for the antiquity of certain practices,” Frankfurter said. “We can take that model to other areas of the [Roman Empire] that have less documentation, like Gaul, where very often we rely on Roman historians to tell us what these people were doing before Christianity.”
To this end, Frankfurter noted some features of Egyptian Christianity, particularly how and why indigenous practices contributed to the religion.
“Eygptian Christianity was Eygptian as well as Christian. We have to appreciate the contribution of the indigenous practices to Christianity,” Frankfurter said. “Egypt offers a rich picture of this process.”
Frankfurter said that different objectives led the church and the indigenous Egyptians to participate in the same process of Christianization.
“There is the interest of the church in destroying Satan and spreading religion,” he said. “And then the interest of the communities in wanting to be part of this large movement.”
During the rest of the lecture, Dieleman discussed the possible reasons and the geographical origin of this shift.
“This suggests that the use of metal is Mediterranean and maybe started in Phoenicia and then was taken over by the Greeks, and came into Egypt with Alexandria and was taken up as part of existing Egyptian tradition,” he said.

A panel of women involved in politics discussed the varying role of gender in politics and in the upcoming presidential election in an event Tuesday night at the Davidson Conference Center.
Gender roles · Panelists Maddy Lansky and Rachel Michelin discuss the importance of women voters in the upcoming election. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, in conjunction with California Women Lead and the USC Women’s Student Assembly, presented the event, which included student panelists from the USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans.
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said women play a vital role in elections, particularly married women, who tend to be the largest group of swing voters. Candidates target this group’s vote by campaigning on specific issues, according to Schnur.
“If Mitt Romney is successful in convincing married female voters that they should cast their ballot primarily on the basis of economic issues like jobs and taxes, then Mitt Romney will be elected president of the United States,” Schnur said. “If Barack Obama is successful in convincing the same married female voters that in addition to the economy, they should also consider a broader range of social and cultural issues, then he will be elected president.”
Panelists also discussed the general response of women to the increasingly negative presidential campaign.
Rachel Michelin, executive director of California Women Lead, said that women generally dislike the negativity in campaigns and would rather focus on the ways the issues relate to them.
Michelin said that female candidates are often forced into negative campaigns because of the precedent set by male candidates.
“Unfortunately, as women, we play by the political rules that were written by men, and until we, as women, change those rules, we’re always pushing ourselves into that arena,” Michelin said. “As women, we need to start changing those rules.”
Michelin said that women in politics still face major challenges in receiving equal treatment among their male counterparts.
The panelists also discussed the background of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s “binders full of women” comment from the second presidential debate.
According to Michelin, the Massachusetts program that Romney was referring to was based on a 1990s California program to include more women in state appointments and had an overall positive effect.
“Some of those women in Massachusetts went on to run for office and apply for higher level positions,” Michelin said. “I think that’s something that, as women, we should be applauding.”
The treatment of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compared with that of the male candidates also came up in the discussion. All panelists agreed that female candidates were often subject to negative comments about their appearance and ability to balance their familial obligations with political work.
Maddy Lansky, president of the USC College Republicans, said a generational gap doesn’t allow younger voters to recognize the struggles of women in politics, which could be this generation’s downfall.
“We are told that we can do whatever want, we can have whatever job we want, if we work hard enough we’ll get there,” Lansky said. “I think that it’s good that we believe that so thoroughly, but it can also be a problem when we don’t understand the challenges that are there — because I don’t think we appreciate the women running for office.”

California’s unemployment rate decreased from 10.6 percent to 10.2 percent between August and September with 8,500 new jobs added to the market — the second largest drop in the nation, according to statistics released Friday by the Unemployment Development Department.
Still, California’s unemployment rate remains the third highest in the country, and the L.A. area’s unemployment hovers above the statewide rate at 10.6 percent. The slow pace of job growth could have a direct impact on USC students. Employment rates for new college graduates are very low with nearly half of all college graduates under age 25 unemployed or employed in jobs that do not require a college degree, according to a Northeastern University study that looked at 2011 data.
Though conditions might not be optimal, Carl Martellino, executive director of the USC Career Center, said the situation is ultimately positive.
“The outlook for our students searching for jobs after graduation has continued to improve with each year since the Great Recession of 2008 being better than the year prior,” Martellino said.
Rebeca Enriquez, a senior majoring in business, is not looking for a job in Los Angeles, but said she has noticed the effects of unemployment throughout the state. She plans to look for work in San Diego after graduation.
“It’s been tough to find a job down there -— at least the jobs I want to try and go into,” Enriquez said.
Martellino noted that job creation is dependent on every industry. The National Association of Colleges and Employers expects to hire 13 percent more graduates from the class of 2013 than from the class of 2012, and many industries are anticipating double-digit increases.
But economists differ on how telling economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are. The rate is calculated by finding the percentage not working in the labor force, which is defined as those who are working or who have looked for a job in the last four weeks.
Some economists believe that many unemployed people might be excluded from this count as they have stopped searching for a job. This “discouraged workers effect” would account for the decrease in unemployment despite few gains in job creation. Other economists claim that looking at statistics in a one-month period is not enough to determine the state of the economy. Unemployment is down 1.5 percent from last September, and around 262,000 jobs have been added to the market in the past year.
Students entering the job market will also be forced to compete with more potential workers, however, because many older people who lost money during the recession cannot afford to retire, making their years of experience a factor in the applicant pool.
Martellino stressed the importance of gaining work experience.
“The internship has really become the new interview,” Martellino said.
He said he believes students should not enter the market worrying they will not find a job.
“Don’t let the news on the economy cause delay — prepare and there are opportunities for you,” Martellino said.

As a part of the freshmen lecture series at the Viterbi School of Engineering, YouTube co-founders Steve Chen and Chad Hurley spoke Tuesday to students about their entrepreneurial endeavors.
Tech boom · YouTube’s co-founder Steve Chen speaks Tuesday to freshmen at the Viterbi School of Engineering about how his experiences in college influenced his career. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Hurley and Chen both discussed their time in college and how it affected their experience creating YouTube. Hurley attended the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Chen attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“You need strategy at the end of the day,” Hurley said. “No matter what position you’re in, you need to be creative.”
Chen and Hurley met at PayPal, where Chen served as one of the first product engineers and Hurley was the first user-interface designer.
In 2005, Hurley and Chen co-founded YouTube. Hurley and Chen said their inspiration for creating the popular video-sharing website stemmed from the abundance of videos that came about in the 21st century.
They said the concept of YouTube was to create a place where users could conveniently share videos because the media players of the early 2000s were insufficient and scattered.
At the onset of YouTube’s creation, there was no funding for the project — the only source of finance was Chen’s credit card.
“I was sucked dry,” he said.
As time went on, however, Chen’s investment paid off.
“People started looking to us as a consistent source of video,” Hurley said.
YouTube quickly became a central source of media sharing for people across the planet. At the time, one of YouTube’s main competitors was Google, with  its “Google Video” platform.
“We were always afraid of Google because of all the resources they had at their disposal,” Chen said. “We were always trying to be more competitive and more efficient.”
Eighteen months after YouTube’s founding, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion.
“I really don’t think YouTube would be where it is today without the support of Google,” Hurley said.
Until 2010, Hurley served as the CEO for YouTube and until 2009, Chen served as its chief technology officer.
Currently, Hurley and Chen are working together on a new project called AVOS Systems. AVOS Systems’ website describes its mission as “committed to building great products that people use in their everyday lives.”
Some of the websites featured through AVOS Systems include Delicious.com, Zeen.com and Meiwei.fm.
According to Chen, AVOS Systems globalized quickly because it was difficult to find qualified engineers to fill the positions of the company. AVOS Systems’ headquarters lies in San Mateo, Calif., but it has other offices in Beijing, China, and New Zealand.
Chen and Hurley, both in their mid-30s, finished their presentation by advising students to do work that they enjoy.

T.J. McDonald has been named a quarterfinalist for the 2012 Lott IMPACT Trophy for the second year in a row, the IMPACT Foundation announced Tuesday.
The senior safety is among 20 quarterfinalists from across the nation and is the only candidate from USC.
The award recognizes the defensive player who best exemplifies integrity, maturity, performance, academics, community and tenacity (IMPACT).
The award is also named after former USC safety and NFL Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott.
On the gridiron, McDonald leads the Trojans this season with 53 tackles, 27 of them unassisted. He has one interception, with a total of six for his USC career. He currently stands in 3rd place in the Pac-12 in assisted tackles.
Off the field, McDonald is enrolled at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. He was also one of 16 Trojans, including  senior quarterback Matt Barkley and junior wide receiver Robert Woods, who took a service trip to Haiti last spring to build homes for the impoverished.
McDonald chose to return to school last December rather than leave early for the NFL and is serving as a team captain for the second consecutive season. He was a first team All-Pac-12 selection as a junior.
The semi finalists for the IMPACT award will be announced Nov. 13, followed by four finalists who will be announced Nov. 28. Those four players will then be invited to a ceremony in Newport Beach, on Dec. 9, where the winner will be announced at the Lott IMPACT Trophy Awards Ceremony.

A little more than a week into its practice schedule, the USC men’s basketball team is slowly gelling.
The Trojans have been hard at work since Oct. 12, stressing the importance of defensive fundamentals as they gear up for the start of the regular season on Nov. 9 against Coppin State.
Improved · Junior forward Dewayne Dedmon is one of many Trojans expected to step up this season. He averaged 7.6 points per game in 2011. – Daily Trojan file photo
“We want to make sure we’re great man-to-man wise,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “[We want to be] a good transition defensive team, good scramble team. We’ve scrimmaged almost every day, which has been good for our guys. It’s just a matter of putting in the time and getting guys right on every possession, every play.”
Toward the end of each practice, USC has brought in referees to help simulate experiences which could prove useful in the coming months.
“It’s helping us a lot,” senior forward Renaldo Woolridge said. “Me particularly, being in a lot of pressure situations, definitely being able to have a lot of poise. Just seeing different lineups going together in different situations. So I think it’s been a good adjustment. And also with the refs, knowing when and when not to foul.”
O’Neill had been interested in instituting the daily scrimmages for some time but didn’t have enough active bodies in previous years to do so. It has been a welcome addition for the team.
“It’s nice to say, ‘Well, we’re going to sit around and do some special situations,”’ O’Neill said. “You can’t contrive them, you’ve got to let them happen. The more we scrimmage, the more guys will be in game situations.”
The Trojans are still trying to incorporate an almost entirely new group of players into O’Neill’s system. But from all indications, the different members of the roster have quickly meshed on and off the court.
“We have a bunch of new pieces, a bunch of new guys, and [we’ve] just been doing a lot of team bonding,” junior guard J.T. Terrell said. “Hanging out on the court, in the locker room, playing video games all the time, hanging out with each other outside of school.”
Woolridge agreed with his new teammate.
“It feels like we’ve actually known each other for a long time, but it’s only been a few months,” Woolridge said. “The chemistry on our team is really good.”
Starting senior point guard Jio Fontan and senior center Omar Oraby both sustained injuries last Saturday and did not take part in the most recent practice session. O’Neill expects both to return by the end of the week, perhaps as early as Wednesday.
“We’re learning how to play harder, we’re a little nicked up right now,” O’Neill said. “Jio got a cut and Omar has a concussion, but I like how hard we play, I like how long we play hard. I think we’re physical. We just have a long way to go, like any team this time of year.”
Other than Fontan locking up point guard duties, starting positions at the other four spots remain wide open. End of practice scrimmages have yet to feature anything resembling a first or second team as players continue to show what they can contribute.
“I’m a playmaker,” Terrell said. “Whether it’s scoring, making a play on defense, making a play for somebody else on offense. I just think I bring a little bit of everything to the table. Whatever the team needs me to do to win is what I’m going to do.”
O’Neill has taken note of what each player brings to the table and said he is appreciative of everyone’s work ethic so far.
“Dewayne Dedmon has had a great week of practice,” O’Neill said. “But really I couldn’t say that anyone didn’t stick out, I think everyone has had their moments where they play great basketball. Their effort was tremendous all the way through.”
Omar Oraby is a sophomore not a senior who might have to redshirt this season. O’Neill is still more concerned with defense first which is why he can’t recruit good talent out of high school. Last hurrah’s for this coach unless major turnaround happens.

A fake extra point gone awry in the first quarter of USC’s 50-6 victory over Colorado last Saturday serves as just the latest example of the Trojans’ alarming lapse in judgment when it comes to showing common courtesy for opponents.
Allow me to clarify.
Mind games · Against Colorado, sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler switched to No. 35 in an effort to throw off the Buffaloes. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
When USC lined up for the extra point with the score already at 13-0, a player wearing No. 35 positioned himself as the holder. But punter Kyle Negrete, who usually wears the number, wasn’t on the field.
Rather, backup quarterback Cody Kessler had been told by the coaching staff to swap jerseys before the game started. And on that play, he grabbed the snap and took off for the end zone, but the play was called off because of holding.
In the interest of full disclosure, I’m far from an avid defender of the many unwritten rules that exist in different sports. Plenty are steeped in traditions that make very little sense to anyone at present. But there remains a fine line between employing normal gamesmanship and doing something unethical. It’s worth pointing out, under coaching ethics in the official NCAA rulebook, “changing numbers during the game to deceive the opponent” is deemed as a number of unethical practices.
So USC’s deceptive use of jersey numbers, while not illegal, only compounds the Trojans’ penalty problems that seem to give off an impression of a lack of respect for the game’s most basic practices.
As Orange County Register writer Rich Hammond pointed out, USC stands as one of just a few remaining programs in the country without names on the backs of their jerseys. That’s a personal preference, not an excuse to take advantage of the situation to intentionally throw off another team.
USC was favored by more than 40 points entering its game against the one-win Buffaloes. They weren’t going to lose. Really want to go for two with the score sitting at 13-0? Probably not worth it, but I’m not going to argue with a surprise playcall when the game is still within reach. Once again, though, that fine line of gamesmanship enters the picture. A trick formation is one thing, taking advantage of an opportunity barely available to others for such a small payoff becomes another.
But the bigger problem here lies in the disconnect between what the coaching staff has been preaching and what’s happening on the field among players. Following the ejection of freshman defensive lineman Leonard Williams against Colorado — one of the day’s 10 penalties — USC coach Lane Kiffin said his team’s lack of composure was “a disgrace to the university.”
But that was nothing new for the Trojans, who lead the nation in penalties per contest. USC has been, without a doubt, an unruly football team for most of the season. Though they are committing an excess of false starts and offsides, these are completely preventable.
Kiffin can talk about how disappointed he is in the lack of discipline, but at some point the coaching staff has to take some of the blame as well. Bush-league moves like swapping Negrete’s jersey for Kessler’s only exacerbate the problem. It contributes to USC’s “dirty” image, which, despite the incredible amount of penalties, really isn’t a fair characterization.
Kiffin gets a bad rap for his stoic persona and “win at all costs” mentality, but for the most part, he’s been on his best behavior since returning to Los Angeles. No need to ruin that now over something so silly and unnecessary.
For the time being, USC’s consistent mental slip-ups and childish attempts at gaining an edge haven’t really cost them. But the first half of the team’s schedule was a walk in the park compared to what’s approaching.
Penalty yards add up, especially against teams capable of turning an extra first down into points. Kiffin and company need to focus and set a proper example for the rest of the team. If he really chides his players for making boneheaded mistakes, USC should be able clean up what has become an unexpected but mammoth flaw. The Trojans are simply too motivated to let one of the only things they can control during a game negatively affect them. And they’re too talented to have to resort to plays like the one in the early minutes of Saturday’s game.
 
“The Fifth Quarter” runs every other Wednesday. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Alex at ajshultz@usc.edu.
After USC’s stunning loss to Arizona, caused largely by the undisciplined actions of the players, it’s time to place the blame squarely on the shoulders of Lane Kiffin.  He lacks the maturity and wisdom to control and command the respect of players who are behaving like juvenile delinquents. USC needs a grown man as head coach, not a kid who relies on his pop to help manage the team.
Yet one more reason why it was so satisfying to see Stanford beat USC.
It was also very satisfying watching UW beat Stanford.
That this number-swapping story should even appear in the Daily Trojan Iindicates that the Trojan sense of sportsmanship has not totally disappeared from our tradition, at least in the Journalism School if not the McKay Center.  The deceptive play wasn’t so much evil as it was childish.  I suppose in defense of that notion is that Lane Kiffin is among the youngest head coaches in collegiate football.  However, his father, Monty Kiffin, is a fully growed-up man and so is Athletic Director, Pat Haden.  I’d like to read an interview with Haden on this matter.  How ’bout it, Alex?

Changing jerseys before the game is part of the game. Just like trick plays are part of the game. I personally liked it and found it clever and imaginative. Maybe if more teams kept names off the back of their jerseys and played as a team and not as individuals, they could do the same.
Clearly you know nothing of classy, respectable gamesmanship. To pull this in a game that clearly was going to be a blowout (-40 point favorite) looks horrible on the coaching staff.
It is definitely illegal.. You should read more into the rule book… Page FR22… First line…

Agree, the team lacks discipline. Kiffin is better suited for the NFL ( no fun league ). He plays not to lose since the first loss to Stanford figuring one more loss will eliminate team from a BCS major bowl game. Changing #’s was
idiotic. Maybe figuring out a decent two-pt. play would be more appropriate.

No. 9 USC’s battle with No. 4 Oregon is two weeks away, and USC coach Lane Kiffin still wants to make sure that USC is focused on its game with Arizona this weekend. In fact, Kiffin hinted that this could be USC’s most daunting game yet.
“These guys very easily could only have one loss,” Kiffin said. “Ask Washington, ask Stanford, ask anybody who’s been playing them. They’re really good and they’re very dangerous.”
Open battle · Sophomore left tackle Aundrey Walker left Saturday’s game with an injury. With his status unknown for this weekend, freshman Max Tuerk might start in his place. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
While first-year Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez has transformed an offense that’s now averaging 39 points a game, it’s Arizona’s defense that truly presents a challenge. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley and the USC offense have yet to face a 3-3-5 base defense like Arizona’s.
“It’s something new and we obviously have to prepare for it,” Kiffin said. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley chimed in about the defense as well.
“They play downhill, they play fast,” Barkley said. “They play really hard [on defense].”
—
The big positional battle for the Trojans this weekend is at left tackle. Sophomore Aundrey Walker suffered an unspecified injury against Colorado. Kiffin, however, has no update on his status for this upcoming game. The other left tackle, freshman Max Tuerk, continues to impress.
“Max took a lot of reps today, just like he did last week and just like he did in the game,” Kiffin said. “He played half the game last week and did a really good job.”
—
One of the biggest problems for USC this season has been the penalties it has racked up. USC currently is the most penalized team in the country, and they had 10 against Colorado last weekend.
“Because of what happened in the first half and the way that it went, Leonard [Williams] getting kicked out, I think their eyes are open to [the penalties] and the leaders are stepping up today,” Kiffin said. He did not comment on Williams’ status for next game.
—
In a somewhat controversial moment of the game, backup quarterback Cody Kessler wore punter Kyle Negrete’s No. 35 jersey for holding duties during an extra point attempt. Kessler said he had no idea why he was asked by coach John Baxter to wear that jersey.
“We change jerseys all the time with our guys,” Kiffin said. “Everything’s within college rules.”

USC has purchased the University Village shopping center, a move expected to lower the vacancy rate of the center and increase services available to students and the community, university officials said Wednesday.
Negotiations began in May and were completed last week, said Mary Hayakawa, director of property sales, development and management. Hayawaka declined to state the cost of the shopping center.
There are no plans to tear down the 14.6-acre shopping center, which will continue to house USC offices and retail stores, Hayakawa said.
“We plan to continue to operate the village as a viable retail establishment,” she said. “Space on campus is always changing and we will use the space as necessary.”
UV has about a 20 percent vacancy rate and was refinanced in 1998. The mall opened in 1975 and was offered for sale in May.
Several university offices, such as USC’s Travel Store, have leased space on the second floor of the UV for years, Hayakawa said. Administrators will complete a long-term strategic plan in the next few months, she said.
There are 56 leases in the UV, which has about 200,000 square feet of leasable space. Leases will be considered for renewal as they expire, a process expected to begin next year, Hayakawa said.
“They will be negotiated at a fair market value,” she said. “The long term is really for the university administration to determine.
“In the short term, this will be good not only for the staff, faculty and students, but for the community as well because we will maintain (the turn-around) that has already been started.”
Managers at Starbucks, which opened last month, have not had any problems, said Jenny Lang, a shift supervisor.
“A bookstore would be nice so people could read while they drink their coffee,” said Lang, who has worked in Pasadena and Downtown. “This is an area where Starbucks wouldn’t normally have a store, but we’ve still been pretty busy.”
Parking areas are spotted with potholes and need to be improved for better customer service, said Alexander Hernandez, manager of Subway in UV.
“We also need signs that publicize what stores are in here,” he said. “USC students know what they have, but people driving by don’t. I think (the purchase) will make us communicate better with the community and with USC.”
Student Senate President Tyler Kelley said he heard about the plans for purchase in August and sent a letter to Thomas Moran, vice president for business affairs, requesting an opportunity for student input. Kelley said he has not received any response from Moran, who could not be reached for comment.
“It is absolutely critical to have students involved in anything like this,” said Kelley, a senior majoring in political science and international relations. “This isn’t something we’re going to see now. This is for the future students who come in two, five or 10 years.”
All stores and their services should remain the same, said Arnold Tsai, a sophomore majoring in biology.
“I think it’s a cool place. Things are cheaper there,” Tsai said. “If we can use discretionary there now, that would be awesome.”
Because the stores will still be privately owned, it is unlikely the purchase will have any effects on Senate’s plan to implement discretionary off campus, Kelley said.
UV currently contracts with an outside security agency, and it has not been determined whether the area will now come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Safety, said Chief Bob Taylor.
“We need to look at the kind of operations that would be needed and see if there is an advantage in maintaining the service they already have,” Taylor said, adding that three or four security guards patrol the property in each shift which would still be the case if DPS took over. “There are details like their cameras and alarm system that have to be worked out. We have to see if those should be connected to us.”
Founders Bank in UV was robbed the week before classes started and response time may have been quicker if the systems were connected with DPS, Taylor said.
Many store managers are speculating additional businesses will be attracted to UV.
“Competition is always good for everybody,” said Carl Ozuna, manager of the Paper Clip. “It seems like USC has a really positive attitude and it will be business as usual.”
Students hope to see more well-known businesses.
“I’d like to see some places people have heard of,” said Jennifer Ely, a senior majoring in psychology. “Hopefully, they’ll actually do something with it. They need to get big-name stores so people will go there. I have a car, so I can go other places, but if that was my only outlet, it would be bad if they tore it down.”
Commuter Nicole Johnson has never shopped at UV, but hopes the USC purchase will improve the area.
“If there were shops and restaurants, I’d probably go,” said Johnson, an undeclared sophomore. “Everyone’s told me there’s no reason to go because there is nothing there.
With the expulsion of long term tenant “32nd St. Market” the handwriting was on the wall.
Superior accepted a short term lease and the rest is history.
Morrie we miss you.

Original Date of Publication: Oct. 16, 1984
Vice President George Bush, speaking Monday from the steps of Doheny Library, characterized Democrats as belonging to a party that wants to limit opportunity and that “says no to hope.”
Bush also attacked Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale, calling him “wedded to the failures of the past,” and declaring that “in overwhelming numbers, young people are saying goodbye… to Mondale and his ship of failure.”
The speech – which lasted only nine minutes – was the second at the university by a major candidate in the presidential race in the last month, and was far more well received by students than Mondale’s speech a month earlier.
Anti-Reagan demonstrators did not heckle Bush, and the only interruptions were supportive cheers from flag-waving students at the front of the crowd, or boos when Bush mentioned Mondale or his running mate, Geraldine Ferraro.
Bush avoided specifics, instead reiterating the themes of the Reagan campaign, and appealed to the interests of increasingly conservative college students by emphasizing technology, jobs, personal income and the space program.
“We have regained our technological edge, we’ve regained it in world competition and America is voting yes to the future, to your future of opportunity,” Bush said.
He called the Republican Party the party of new ideas, declaring “tax cuts, investment opportunity and economic expansion . . . are the new ideas that offer a future to everybody here today.”
Responding to Democratic charges that Reagan’s economic policies lack compassion for the poor and minorities, Bush charged, “They are the party that offered the highest misery index in the history of the United States of America.”
And reacting to charges by Mondale that Reagan has failed to achieve an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union, Bush said Reagan “doesn’t believe in limitations that don’t limit” but in “verifiable arms reductions.”
“Give him four more years, and you watch those Soviets come to the table,” Bush said, to which students replied with chants of “peace through strength.”
He later charged that Mondale and the Democratic Party want to negotiate with the Soviet Union “from a position of relative weakness” and “lock our European allies into an inferior position.”
Bush also supported Reagan’s “Star Wars” program of space-based laser-beam and satellite-defense systems to protect the United States against nuclear attack.
Critics of the program contend it is unfeasible because the required technology does not yet exist, and the system could not stop all incoming missiles. Bush advocated research into such a system.
“Let’s use America’s future, let’s use our technology to pursue peace and spare people the agony of war,” he said.
Bush attacked Mondale and Ferraro, repeating the theme Reagan has used in his campaign, that Democrats see only bad news: “They see a silk lining out there and they try to find a great black cloud to go around it.”
He further characterized Democrats as belonging to a party of pessimism, taxes and restricted economic growth, charges Reagan has leveled against the Democratic Party as well.
“We’re too great to wrap ourselves up in malaise and bad news,” Bush said. “We’re too great to retreat back into the past.”
Bush’s biggest cheer from the crowd came when he asked students to vote for Republican candidates for the House of Representatives and “lift up Tip O’Neill,” Democratic Speaker of the House and outspoken critic of Reagan.

For anyone who appreciates science fiction, it is impossible not to love, admire and pay tribute to the literary magician Ray Bradbury.
The Fremont Centre Theater in South Pasadena paid homage to the author last Sunday with performances of selected readings from Bradbury’s works; actors from the Fremont Theater who worked with him also shared anecdotes about Bradbury, who passed away last June at the age of 91.
Acclaimed author · The Fremont Theater remembered sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury on Sunday night with a special tribute ceremony. – | Photo courtesy of Ralph Nelson
The Fremont’s tribute seems oddly appropriate: Bradbury had a history of working with the theater. The author was an avid playwright who dreamed of having his works onstage but initially floundered when pen came to paper. After several false starts, Bradbury finally hit his stride and wrote numerous plays in the second half of his career, finishing with four spectacular years at the Fremont.
The building itself seems like something from one of Bradbury’s time travel stories, with carpeted hallways, old-fashioned posters, signs with lights that click when turned on and off and an auditorium that could fit no more than 75 patrons. With unfinished walls painted cream and crimson, a vaulted wood ceiling with exposed wooden beams, a small stage with a few stools and some jack-o’-lanterns, audience members get the feeling they are in another realm, which fits perfectly once readings of martians and mummies start taking place on stage.
“[This ceremony is] not a show, but a very personal tribute to a man who meant so much to us,” said Lissa Reynolds, the executive board president of the Fremont Theater.
And that is exactly what the performers and friends of Bradbury delivered.
With speeches and anecdotes told by Robert Kerr, an actor who moved to Los Angeles from Texas in order to find and work with Bradbury, South Pasadena City Librarian Steve Fjeldsted and the two artistic directors, Lissa and James Reynolds, the audience  quickly realized the humility, kindness, genius and power that Bradbury held. From the Fremont’s presentation, it was easy to see that the author had a heavy impact on literature and the people who loved him.
As is made obvious by works such as Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury was a lover of books and libraries. Quotes from the author such as, “Books are the building blocks, the DNA, if you will, of you,” and, “Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future,” highlight Bradbury’s passions, and the evening at the Fremont made sure to emphasize the prominent and special place of literature in Bradbury’s heart.
Calling attention to the fact that Bradbury dropped out of college because he saw it as a waste of time and instead educated himself in libraries, the evening’s sponsors further emphasized the sci-fi author’s love of libraries. The event commemorated libraries as much as it celebrated Ray Bradbury himself: Donations and proceeds from the evening were donated to the Friends of the South Pasadena Library, as Bradbury would have wanted.
But the evening was also full of funnier anecdotes about the author. According to Kerr, Bradbury had a habit of pulling out his one and only driver’s license, which was registered in Mars. Bradbury frequently visited the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge and was able to drive the various Mars rovers, which is how he obtained this unique license. This story seemed to sum up Bradbury perfectly: a man with a sense of humor — unique among a sea of commonplace writers — who refused to be tied to this single Earth and brought to life planets and people that were never before considered.
After the audience got a taste of Bradbury from those who knew him more intimately than most, actors of the Ray Bradbury Pandemonium Theatre Company performed six readings from various works written by Bradbury, ranging from The Martian Chronicles to Pillar of Fire to the short story, “Colonel Stonesteel’s Genuine Home-Made Truly Egyptian Mummy.”
Each work expressed Bradbury’s unparalleled fantastical abilities as well as his gift for making prose sound like poetry. Though hearing his works read aloud by actors added even more dimension to the already vivid characters, as Lissa Reynolds said, this evening was not about a performance or a series of readings. It was about a man, and that is exactly what was accomplished. By 10 p.m., audience members couldn’t help but feel closer to the beloved author.
At the end of the evening, one actor who had worked closely with Bradbury at the Fremont read a poem he had written for and performed at the author’s 89th birthday. The poem spoke of the imaginative, spectacular and all-powerful being that was Ray Bradbury and clearly highlighted the effect that Bradbury had on the world, leaving a strong impression on audience members before they headed out for the night.
“I am all things impossible made possible,” says one of Bradbury’s main characters in Pillar of Fire. For many, this embodies Bradbury himself — a man who brought readers worlds and realms that they were familiar only in their wildest dreams. Bradbury was a scribe, a master keeper of far-off fantasies, and although greatly saddened by his physical absence today, this magician’s wonders can still be found by getting lost in one of his works.

Last year I reviewed Breaking Dawn — Part 1 for the Daily Trojan, and I took a lot of flak for it. Twi-hards can be pretty vicious when they’re hiding behind an anonymous comment system. I won’t deny that my words were harsh, but I have — embarrassingly enough — read all the books and seen all the movies that have come out so far, so at the very least I’m well acquainted with the material.
I say this because I’m about to discuss Breaking Dawn — Part 2, which hits theaters in a little less than a month, and I want you, my trusted and faithful readers, to know that this column does not come from a bias against Twilight. It comes from a film writer concerned about how audiences view their reactions to certain films. Do note, however, that I am not condoning the brutal scrutiny of Part 2 just because Part 1 was poorly received by critics. Every film deserves a chance — even if it’s a part of the Twilight saga.
Looking back at the negative feedback I received from my review and looking forward to its follow-up, I’ve been thinking about the different ways viewers receive films. In this case, there’s a very distinct divide in the way the first part was received. Critics tore the most recent installment apart, while fans remained faithful to the series.
These divisive reactions have made me feel the need to make one very important point: There is a difference between good movies and ones we enjoy.
We, as moviegoers, need to focus less on our emotional responses to a work and more on specific cinematic elements. We need to determine whether a narrative is cohesive and endearing, if a film style is interesting and advances the story and if the acting is convincing and well played.
A movie is not necessarily good just because we like it. I loved the first installment of the Twilight series. I’ll admit it — I saw the movie three times in theaters. (I was just as enthusiastic as the next Team Edward member.) And though Twilight was of a higher caliber than Part 1, looking back, I can see that I was caught up in my love for the books. This love blinded me from seeing the movie’s flaws — think cheesy special effects (glitter anyone?), for example.
In turn, even if we might not like a movie, this doesn’t mean it isn’t good. Heck, I wasn’t the biggest fan of Argo (that puts me against the majority of the film-going world). I thought it did a poor job of balancing dramatic and comedic content; it wasn’t very fluid.
My personal feelings aside, I recognize that the film is a surefire Oscar contender. Most reviews I’ve read and moviegoers I’ve talked to have praised the film for its brilliant performances and dynamic, multi-layered approach to telling the story of the Iranian Hostage Crisis.
So I’m not saying that certain films are inherently bad and others are definite hits. Part 1 wasn’t awful just because it’s a Twilight movie. It was bad because of its heightened melodrama and unconvincing acting. Just like how Argo wasn’t great because of the big names backing it: Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman. It was great because it had an interesting story that was well executed by a talented cast and crew.
Filmgoers have to push any and every personal bias aside while viewing a film if they want to judge it objectively: A film’s success isn’t measured by an individual’s interpretation; it’s measured by its narrative, film style and acting, to name a few factors.
A few weeks back, I wrote about action films and said that we should consider films within the context of their genre, and I stand by that statement. You can’t compare Taken 2  to Anna Karenina or that to Wreck-It Ralph because they are all so different and are all attempting to meet different goals. These different goals, in turn, affect the cinematic devices that follow, and this logic applies to the Twilight series and Argo, as well.
But a film’s success cannot solely be measured by whether or not it meets its own goals. Of course, the context of a genre is important, but if a film can’t meet the basic standards of filmmaking, then context goes out the window and the movie becomes plain bad.
And, as with any film, people are entitled to their own opinion, but our personal biases often obstruct the way we look at film. We need to learn to differentiate our individual interpretation from the actual quality, or lack thereof, of a film.
Like I said, we can enjoy good films, but a film isn’t necessarily good just because we enjoy it — some food for thought that I hope Twi-hards will consider the fifth time around.

On its third album, Local Business, Titus Andronicus sounds like the same band it has always been: an intersection of punk and Americana, just as influenced by The Clash as Bruce Springsteen.

Titus Andronicus is a group deeply entrenched in rock ‘n’ roll history and its influences are varied and unmistakable. The group shares The Hold Steady’s vibe as a great American bar band: Titus Andronicus is completely raw and soul-bearing, but its members are more ambitious than the usual, occasionally employing some of the grandiosity of a band like Arcade Fire.
On Local Business, this ambition is readily apparent, particularly on tracks like “My Eating Disorder,” an eight-minute epic about struggling with one’s body (a topic that pops up a few times on the album). The song kicks off with a guitar riff reminiscent of a Keith Richards instrumental. Later in “My Eating Disorder,” a guitar solo might remind listeners of both The Vibrators  — one of the few punk bands that regularly employed guitar solos — and Dinosaur Jr., but the instrumental segment builds to something much more unique than just the sum of its influences. Still, the genuineness of frontman Patrick Stickle’s emotions is the main reason the music works and very rarely feels overly emo or angsty.
On this track, and for much of the album, the band employs the same type of rousing, repetitive, drunken, anthemic choruses that have always been a staple of its music. At the end of “My Eating Disorder,” Stickles repeats the phrase “spit it out” several times, as both his vocals and the music slowly build in intensity to an anguished cry. This contrasts with the almost proud nature of his repetition of the phrase “my eating disorder” earlier in the song.
The previous track, a much more simplistic number, is the minute-long raucous, “Food Fight!” whose only lyrics are — no surprise here — “food fight.” This juxtaposition is emblematic of the band’s sense of humor.
“Titus Andronicus vs. The Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)” stands out as the most overtly punk song on the album with very simple and repetitive lyrics, entirely composed of the words “I’m going insane.” Admittedly, it’s a little obvious, but part of the fun of the song is its ridiculousness, and the music unrelentingly moves forward at such a breakneck speed that you have little time to ponder the lyrics.
On “In a Small Body,” Titus Andronicus sounds like a darker, angrier version of Bruce Springsteen, with Stickles yelling “Don’t tell me I was born free / That joke has been old since high school,” as big, sprawling instrumentation backs him.
The intro to “(I Am The) Electric Man” sounds like the happy side of Lou Reed, with some Television-esque guitar action. Once Stickles starts singing solo, a tinge of influence from Modest Mouse’s Isaac Brock colors his delivery.
The last and longest song on the album, “Tried to Quit Smoking,” is as confessional as it gets, with Stickles singing “It’s not that I wanted to hurt you / I just didn’t care if I did.” The song slowly changes and builds into, “It is not that I do not love you / It’s just that I hate everyone.” There is both remorse and resignation in his voice as he sings these lyrics, but Stickles then juxtaposes this earnestness with the angry ridiculousness of yelling, “Kill kill kill Ronald Reagan” at the top of his lungs.
There is a playfulness to every song on Local Business, despite the heaviness of some of the themes and images. The lyrics in “Upon Viewing Oregon’s Landscape With The Flood Of Detritus” are a perfect example of a combination of the macabre and the absurd. The lyrics describe a deadly car crash that annoys the people stuck in traffic on the way to their caffeine fix. Here, Titus Andronicus’ main focus lyrically is the emptiness, struggle and farce of modern life and deconstructing those aspects of society most of us take for granted.
Local Business, like the band’s other albums, finds a balance between angsty existentialism and simple hedonistic rock ‘n’ roll, but this time around Titus Andronicus is far less reverential than it used to be. There are no more spoken word excerpts from Camus or Lincoln or Whitman: It’s just pure Titus Andronicus all the way through.
The songs get better with each listen and are immensely catchy and danceable, even when Stickles sings cynical lyrics such as, “OK, I think by now we’ve established / Everything is inherently worthless / And there’s nothing in the Universe / With any kind of objective purpose,” as he does in the opening lines of the album. With Titus Andronicus’ music, there is a sense that since everything is meaningless, we all might as well have fun, get drunk and play some rock ‘n’ roll.
For this reason, Titus Andronicus is the kind of band better suited to playing a small, sweaty, cramped dive than a larger venue; their live show is built upon the intimate intensity of the audience dancing and singing along with the same reckless abandon as the band. And Local Business better captures the energy of their live act than 2010’s The Monitor did — the album is less ambitious in its instrumentation and subject matter and more representative of the hard-rocking bar band Titus Andronicus is in concert.
 
Local Business was released Oct. 22 on XL Recordings. Titus Andronicus plays at the El Rey Theater on Nov. 8 with support from Ceremony and Henry Clay People.

Exactly 125 years after his birth, USC Libraries will celebrate the life and accomplishments of  renowned writer Robinson Jeffers.
The talented American poet and environmentalist was nationally known for his creative work about the central California area. But for USC, honoring this great talent comes from a more personal place: Jeffers was a USC alumnus.

The event, which takes place from noon to 5:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Doheny Memorial Library,  will feature a prominent panel of speakers from USC’s history and English departments and the Keck School of Medicine, as well as from Occidental College. Panelists will include Kim Stanley Robinson, author of the award-winning Mars trilogy; Jeffers’ biographer James Karman; USC professors Kevin Starr, Dana Gioia, Devin Griffiths, William Deverell and Gere diZerega; and Occidental College librarians Dale Stieber and Helena de Lemos.
A rare 1936 edition of The Beaks of Eagles and a 1906 copy of The University Courier that included Homeward are two of many works on display at the event from the libraries of Occidental and USC.
Though planning for this celebration of Jeffers began a year ago, orchestrator Dana Gioia, the Judge Widney professor of poetry and public policy at USC and the president of the National Endowment for the Arts, had an eye on Jeffers since the 1970s.
“Twenty-five years ago, on Broadway, I saw his version of Medea, and it was so spectacular that I just didn’t know what to do,” Gioia said. “As we were walking out of the theater, I turned to my wife and said, ‘No one writes this well just once.’ I started reading Jeffers’ works, and I was just enchanted. I realized he was one of the greatest poets in American literature.”
The hype is not undeserved — not by a long shot. Not only was Jeffers the first poet to ever appear on the cover of Time magazine, but in the 1970s — a decade after his death — he also graced U.S. postage stamps. Even The Beach Boys noted his beautiful way with words, making a song out of his poem The Beaks of Eagles for their Holland album in 1973.
Yet, scandals also abounded for Jeffers. For one, after comparing former President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Adolf Hitler for responsibility for WWII, Jeffers experienced backlash that rendered him disreputable until after death. In the 1930s, Jeffers also landed on the front page of the Los Angeles Times for an affair with Una Call Kuster, a married woman he met during his time at USC. As a result, according to Gioia, Jeffers dropped out of USC’s medical school after earning a master’s degree in literature at USC in addition to a bachelor’s degree in literature from Occidental College.
According to Gioia, Jeffers found his second home at USC and was a member of the wrestling team, Sigma Phi fraternity and the track & field team. This high level of involvement at USC is what bewildered Gioia and drove him to initiate a celebration in honor of Jeffers’ memory at USC.
“Robinson Jeffers is one of the most important authors who have ever attended USC, and when I came to USC, I was surprised that there was really little acknowledgement of Jeffers. In fact, many people did not even know that he had attended USC,” Gioia said. “This conference began with my resolve to have USC acknowledge its greatest literary alumnus.”
Since his departure, Gioia said that Jeffers has not received proper recognition at USC.
“We’ve sort of just ignored this great writer who developed on our campus. At the risk of offending people, Occidental has done a far better job of honoring Jeffers’ memory than USC,” Gioia said. “But that’s about to change. In the future, we’re both going to do a great job.”
Robinson, author of the Mars trilogy and a guest speaker on the ecological aspects of Jeffers’ works at the event, read the poet’s work during his college years.
“He’s almost like a science fiction writer because he does talk about the human race and evolution and how we’re just tiny specks in the universe,” Robinson said. “He often goes too far in his anti-humanism, but he’s also trying to correct the natural prejudice that nothing really matters but human beings. Writers like Jeffers are here to tell us that that’s nothing true; the planet matters just as much.”
The Jeffers celebration is intended, in part, to preserve his legacy and remind the USC community of the alumnus’ accomplishments.
“This can’t do much on its own, but it’s a symptom that Jeffers is part of the cannon, and he’s not just going to slip away like his fellow contemporary figures,” Robinson said. “He’s an essential part of the story of California, so this celebration is a mark of that.”
Dean of USC Libraries Catherine Quinlan seeks to strengthen the Trojan connection with Jeffers through the event.
“It’s a great opportunity to celebrate Robinson Jeffers as one of USC’s own,” she said. “What really impresses me about Trojan family members is how they are always striving to do better, to do new things, and I think Robinson Jeffers really exemplifies that.”
Starting Oct. 25, USC Libraries hopes the future of Jeffers at USC will be just as bright as his legacy.
“I hope that this will simply be the first in a series of important events that honor Jeffers’ works,” Gioia said. “This is just the beginning [of] USC embracing its own artistic legacy.”

Eric Bever, the major of Costa Mesa, demonstrates a complete lack of empathy or foresight in his attempt to close a soup kitchen that serves 300 homeless people each day.
Despite evidence to the contrary, Bever argues that the facility only serves the homeless who stream in from out of town, across the Los Angeles County line. Costa Mesa, according to Bever, has no homeless.
Bever’s outlandish claim illuminates a national issue surrounding homelessness: the refusal of some to acknowledge it or see it as a serious problem.
The splendor of Southern California makes it easy to forget that some people are here not for the oceanfront homes, but because the weather is warm enough to sleep outside year round. In fact, there are over 45,000 homeless people in Orange County, despite its status as one of the most expensive areas in the country.
Bever strives to rid his city of this “nuisance,” portraying himself as a hero protecting his citizens. In reality, he is turning a blind eye to a significant percentage of the residents in his community. It is preposterous to think that shutting down the soup kitchen will solve the city’s problem. Removing aid for the homeless will not remove the homeless.
Furthermore, removing the homeless does not make Costa Mesa immune to the problems caused by homelessness. Homelessness lowers the nation’s overall quality of life, raises crime rates and hurts the national economy by rendering hundreds of thousands of people unable to work or contribute effectively to society.
Unlike people in many affluent Southern California communities, USC students witness these effects firsthand.
While people complain about the crime rate and poor aesthetics of the university’s surrounding community, a positive outcome results from such persistent exposure to serious poverty.
Mayor Bever exemplifies the pitfalls of denial; he cannot solve a problem he is unaware of.
USC, however, is training a new generation of leaders and policy makers in hopes that these students will take note of their current surroundings and attempt to fix such problems.

After his record setting six-touchdown performance against Colorado on Saturday, senior Matt Barkley was one of two Pac-12 quarterbacks named as semifinalists for the Davey O’Brien Award. The Davey O’Brien Award is given annually to the best quarterback in the nation. Barkley is joined by his Pac-12 rival, freshman Marcus Mariota of Oregon.
Barkley, in the middle of his final season at USC, shattered former Trojan quarterback Matt Leinart’s career Pac-12 touchdown record on Saturday with his 100th touchdown pass, which came in the first half against Colorado. While falling out of the Heisman spotlight earlier in the season, Barkley has been able to rebound and put himself back in contention. His 22 touchdown passes rank third nationally, as he has led the Trojans to a 4-1 record in the Pac-12.
The wide receivers that Barkley is throwing to are certainly helping the cause as well. Junior Robert Woods and sophomore Marqise Lee are the focal points of the aerial attack coach Lane Kiffin has orchestrated, combining for 17 touchdowns. With Woods’ third touchdown grab on the day against the Buffaloes, he passed Dwayne Jarrett’s USC record for career receptions with 217.
Barkley also set the Pac-12 record for highest completion percentage and highest passing efficiency rating on Saturday, completing 19 out of 20 passes with a 319.2 passing efficiency rating. The Trojans will play at Arizona on Saturday, kicking off a stretch in which their next five opponents own a combined record of 28-7. Two upcoming teams, Notre Dame and Oregon, are ranked above the No. 9 Trojans.

America calls itself the inventor of modern democracy, yet with a mere 62 percent voter turnout for the last presidential election, voter participation in the United States is one of the lowest for any democratic country in the world.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Nearly 40 percent of Americans forfeited their right — and civic duty — to vote in 2008. Some argue that voting is pointless: Unless they live in a swing state, the winners of their state’s electoral votes are predetermined regardless of how they choose to vote.
But voting is not exclusively about choosing the next president. USC students who are registered to vote in California have the chance to make a huge community impact by voting on state measures and local offices.
The ballot California voters will see in two weeks lists several monumental propositions that students should examine.
Proposition 30, which has received considerable media attention over the last several months, impacts youth and higher education directly. It plans for a small increase in state taxes for those whose annual income stands at $250,000 and above in order to fund public education, particularly state universities and community colleges.
Prop. 30 also proposes to direct a portion of the expected additional revenue to local public safety initiatives. Voting yes on Prop. 30 is thus a chance to support a safer Los Angeles as well as increased educational opportunities for our generation.
The opposing measure, Proposition 38, proposes a tax increase for all Californians, regardless of income. The increased revenue would go toward K-12 schools and early childhood programs, although 30 percent would be used to pay down state bond debt for the first four years.
Students thus are presented with a choice between two solutions to the state education and budget crisis facing our generation — or the choice to vote no on both propositions and make personal efforts to find and promote a better option.
In addition to community education, student voters can also impact community health and safety.
One ballot measure, Proposition 37, will require the labeling of genetically engineered foods. The safety of these foods for consumption remains uncertain; however, a growing body of research has linked them to allergies, organ toxicity and other health problems. Furthermore, in a city such as Los Angeles where there is a massive problem with low-income families’ access to healthy food and nutrition education, the right to know a food’s content is particularly important.
Another ballot measure, Proposition 34, would provide a one-time government grant of $100 million to law enforcement agencies for the investigations of homicide and rape cases. The grant would be made possible by eliminating the death penalty and accompanying high costs, such as the appeals process and the upkeep of death row.
The upcoming L.A. ballot also requests that voters choose a candidate for several state and local positions, among which is L.A. County’s District Attorney.
USC students now have the chance to evaluate the legal climate in Los Angeles that has been implemented by Chief Deputy District Attorney Jackie Lacey and whether or not her opponent, Prosecutor Alan Jackson, can do a better job. Jackson has experience prosecuting gang homicide, which is a serious problem in L.A. County; however, might his background increase tension surrounding recent controversial crackdowns on gang activity?
USC students should take particular interest in offices and ballot measures related to crime, not only because of the reality of crime within and around our campus gates, but also because crime dictates community atmosphere and resource allocation. We should support propositions and candidates who we believe will make Los Angeles a safer place, so all residents can maintain a better quality of life.
Whatever students think is the best way to improve their community, they have a right and a responsibility to express their beliefs by voting. The more a community represents itself, the more everyone can benefit from a representative government. USC students can make their particular interests heard, but only if they agree to participate in the democratic process.

Iran is a danger. China is destroying our economy. Oh, and the Middle East is a complete mess.
For those who tuned in to Monday’s presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, that was the takeaway on the state of the world and foreign policy. Only that. Whether it was the fault of the debate commission or the candidates themselves, the debate painted an extremely narrow and naive view of the world and the United States’ interests in it.
Ignoring the absence of conversation on climate change — the first time since 1984 that the topic has not been mentioned in any debate — and many human rights issues, Monday’s debate was an exercise in narrow-mindedness and selective ignorance. Many important issues, as well as more subtle aspects of the main topics of discussion, were absent in the final presidential debate.
After avoiding the issue for much of the election, the candidates finally discussed the war in Afghanistan — a war that has been going on for more than 11 years. They rightfully addressed the state of Afghan security forces, but completely ignored the serious problems of corruption inside the very government the United States supports there.
Moderator Bob Schieffer did propel the debate in a better direction when he asked the candidates about drone strikes. While drone strikes are effective in taking out militants in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere, they also kill a large number of civilians. The candidates’ responses, however, were anything but proportionally adequate to the severity of the topic. Romney enthusiastically said he supports the use of flying machines that rain down death while Obama, the man with a kill list for drone strikes, dodged the question. There was no great debate on one of the United States’ new favorite military tactics — one that also stirs up a lot of anti-American sentiment in key places, such as Pakistan.
Throughout the debate, Israel got a lot of love — the candidates mentioned it 31 times while bringing up the spectre of a nuclear Iran. Yet, the way Iran was talked about, at least by Romney, made it seem like the country is an imminent threat to Israel and the United States and is just itching to start a nuclear war.
Despite this focus on Israel, the candidates ignored the topic of Israeli-Palestinian peace. It continues to be one of the main sources of conflict and strife in the region, and Obama has accomplished next to nothing in the peace process. Romney failed to offer much more Monday night than saying that with the right leadership we will see the “peace and prosperity the world demands.” But ignoring the conflict between Israel and Palestine only allows the continued expansion of illegal settlements while pushing refugees toward extremism.
If national security is as big a deal as the candidates made it out to be, then why not mention the national security threat that’s right outside the United States: the Mexican drug war.
According to estimates, more than 50,000 people are dead, while border violence persists and grows. How either candidate could ignore this makes little sense.
Then there was the economic boogeyman: China. The way Romney and Obama talked about it, it seemed like the People’s Republic is the cause of many of the United States’ economic woes. But they ignored the biggest global economic threat, Europe. As a result of the euro crisis, hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, remain unemployed, and the threat of an economic contagion spreading is high.
Not only that, but the idea of government involvement in the economy is something both candidates love to talk about, so why not bring up the Germany-imposed austerity policies in the Eurozone — policies that are completely failing — as a test case for Obama and Romney’s views?
Some of these topics might not seem interesting to the majority of voters, but it’s not about what interests us. It’s about the country’s role in the world and very real problems that affect all American citizens.
Ignoring these issues not only keeps the public uninformed, but it also paints a false narrative of what the United States needs to focus on and what future dangers it faces. If this is truly what both candidates think matters, then the United States needs to find better leaders.
