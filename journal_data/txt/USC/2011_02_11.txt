USC freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater suffered a foot fracture during an offseason workout this past week, according to USC’s RipsIt Blog.
The injury, which could require surgery to repair the break, might force Prater to miss most of spring practice, which begins March 22.
This serves as yet another setback for the Illinois native, who enrolled at USC in January 2010 before undergoing several injuries that forced him to redshirt and miss the entire season.
With the departure of senior wide receiver Ronald Johnson, the 6-foot-5 Prater is expected to compete for a starting spot opposite sophomore wideout Robert Woods. Sophomore Markeith Ambles, senior Brandon Carswell and incoming freshman George Farmer are expected to contend for a starting spot this fall as well.
The school says Prater is expected to make a full recovery.

Just over a week since reeling in the nation’s No. 4 overall recruiting class for 2011 according to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, USC has begun preparations for its 2012 class, offering Cass Technical (Mich.) cornerback Terry Richardson a scholarship, per USCFootball.com’s Ryan Abraham.
The 5-foot-9 defensive back is regarded as one of the best players in the midwest region, and as a junior in 2010, recorded eight interceptions and 30 tackles. As a sophomore, he finished with four interceptions and 20 tackles.
Other highly-regarded programs such as Alabama, LSU and Michigan have all offered him scholarships, as well.
Presently, USC’s 2012 class includes four prospects: DT Arik Armstead (Elk Grove, Calif.), ATH Jaydon Mickens (Los Angeles), WR Jordan Payton (Westlake Village, Calif.) and ATH Darreus Rogers (Carson, Calif.).

Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott announced Friday that the conference will restructure its football officiating program after undergoing a comprehensive review of its previous system. The conference’s football officiating crew has been much maligned in recent years with the perception of disparity at an all-time high.
“Like in other high priority areas, we have taken a fresh look at our program, and will be implementing a series of changes that are forward-looking, innovative and take our program to the next level,” Scott said in a statement. “The game and level of play is always improving, so it’s essential that in the critical area of officiating, the program continue to evolve and improve as well.”
Leading the changes includes the resignation of coordinator of football officiating Dave Cutaia and the appointment of Mike Pereira, the former Vice President of Officiating for the NFL. Pereira, who served as a consultant for the Pac-10 during the 2010 season, is expected to implement a variety of changes, while serving on an interim basis.
“We are thrilled that Mike Pereira will be leading the restructuring of our football officiating program and will serve as the interim Coordinator,” Scott said.  “He is among the most respected leaders in his field at the professional and collegiate level, and has extensive football officiating and program management experience.”
In the meanwhile, the Pac-10, soon to be the Pac-12, will begin its search for a permanent Coordinator of Officiating.

When USC received 4-star athlete Marqise Lee’s Letter of Intent, coach Lane Kiffin was ecstatic about getting a commitment from a player of his caliber.
Lee (Serra, Gardena, Calif.) has the capability to play on either side of the ball. While playing for Serra High School , Lee played both wide receiver receiver and defensive back, and as a result, Kiffin has an interesting dilemma as where to play Lee.
Another possibility for Lee may be as a guard, not for the football team, but for the basketball team. Lee, who played in both of Serra’s CIF Southern Section champion basketball and football teams, would be a welcome addition to the Trojan basketball team.
Kiffin has given Lee the go ahead to walk on to the basketball team if he wants to, and basketball coach Kevin O’Neill, wouldn’t mind the help. The Trojans, with the transfer of guard Bryce Jones, are lacking depth and would welcome Lee’s athleticism.
“If Lane says he can walk on, he can walk on,” O’Neill said following Tuesday’s practice. “We’ll be happy to have him walk on.”
Ultimately, though, the decision, O’Neill said, is up to Kiffin and Lee.
“I think he’s a good player,” O’Neill said. “Hopefully he’s a guy who has a good football career first. We’ll take our lead from football as far as what they want him to do basketball-wise.”
Lee’s dual-sport athleticism between football and basketball would not be the first, as football player Jordan Cameron walked on to the basketball team in 2008-09 but received little playing time.

Success at McDonald’s Swim Stadium is hardly a foreign concept for the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team. In seven of the past eight seasons, the Women of Troy have posted undefeated marks in their home waters, and they are looking to continue that trend in 2011, as well.
The USC women's water polo team has an undefeated history in its home waters that seems very promising for the rest of the 2011 season.
Following a second place finish in last weekend’s Stanford Invitational, USC (3-1) hosts Cal Baptist (4-2) in a nonconference home contest Saturday at 3 p.m.
The opening weekend tournament in Palo Alto, Calif. provided the Women of Troy with their first test of the 2011 season, facing some of the top teams in the country before eventually falling to No. 1 Stanford 10-9 in overtime of the finals.
“We’re learning from our mistakes we made last weekend. It was our first couple games as a team and we’re going to progress through the season,” said senior two-meter Kristen Dronberger. “Basically, we’re working on everything because it’s early in the season.”
But with their success, the Women of Troy hope to avoid a potential letdown against a Cal Baptist program they would have easily disposed of in previous seasons.
In 2002, the last time the two teams squared off, USC recorded a 21-0 victory over the Lancers at a tournament in Long Beach. Presently, the Women of Troy hold a 5-0 all-time mark against Cal Baptist.
As a result, the team’s defeat at the hands of Stanford has not dampened its high spirits going into Saturday’s game.
“Team mentality is actually pretty good considering we didn’t play that great of a game and still almost beat Stanford” said senior driver Joelle Bekhazi. “We still have much room to improve, and that’s given us a lot of confidence.”
One player to keep an eye on is freshman goalie Flora Bolonyai, who during the Stanford tournament proved her capabilities in the pool, recording 31 saves in four games en route to earning MPSF Newcomer of the Week honors.
“She’s doing an incredible job” Bekhazi said. “The one thing we weren’t sure of was how our goalie was going to do, and now we know that we have a really strong girl in the cage. She basically saved us in the final game last week against Stanford.”
All the players have been working together to make sure their newcomers, including Bolonyai, feel confident enough to play their best.
“It’s given me a huge amount of confidence because last weekend’s games were my first real games,” Bolonyai said. “The team has really helped me because I can always ask when there’s something new going on in defense, and they also help me greatly with blocks and communication.
One thing is for certain: The Women of Troy know they still have to work hard to regain their No. 1 ranking from last season.
“This isn’t our peak. We’re not even close to our peak, so we’re working just as hard as we were before.”

Facing No. 27 South Florida for the first time in 31 years, the No. 17 USC women’s tennis team took very little time in dismantling the visiting Bulls 6-1 on Thursday.
Cream of the crop · Senior Maria Sanchez had another impressive performance Thursday afternoon against South Florida’s Irene Rehberger. - Murugappan Aroohachalam | Daily Trojan 
Senior Maria Sanchez’s 6-4, 6-0 victory against No. 24 Irene Rehberger told the story of the afternoon for the Women of Troy, as she put on a dominating display of tennis on a day that saw USC win five of its six singles matches, in addition to strong performances in doubles play.
Despite a few unforced errors in the earlygoings of the match, Sanchez turned her play up a notch in the middle portion of the first set and never lost momentum, as evidenced by her sweep of the last eight games of the match.
“I felt like I stepped it up at the end of the first set and I never eased up throughout the match,” said Sanchez, who came in as the nation’s number three singles player.
Using her imposing forehand at will, Sanchez took the offensive whenever the opportunity arose and never let the veteran Rehberger, described by USC coach Richard Gallien as “cagey,” back in the match.
In the second singles match, sophomore Danielle Lao had little trouble facing Ecaterina Vasenina, as she kept the Vasenina out of arms reach in the first set, before wrapping up the match with an impressive closing ability in the second and final set, winning 6-2, 6-1.
A top-30 player herself, Lao has proved the perfect complement to Sanchez, who she defeated in the ITA Southwest Regional singles championship last year, and Thursday was no exception.
USC’s sole loss came on the final match of the day, when South Florida’s Loreta Alonso outlasted junior Alli Ramos 7-6, 6-3 in two tightly-contested sets. Alonso’s powerful swings had Ramos on the defense, and despite her grit, she could not recover from the losing tiebreakers at the end of the first set and in the middle of the second.
“Alli’s got the heart of a lion and [is] one of the most important people on our team in terms of characters and spunk and fight. She’ll win lots of matches [for us],” Gallien said.
The three other singles matches all ended in a Women of Troy victory, most notably with sophomore Valeria Pulido shutting out USF’s Alessandra Bonte 6-0, 6-0 in the game’s quickest match.
Senior Cristala Andrews had no problem disposing of Bulls’ Kate Parker in the sixth spot, while the number four match saw freshman Kaitlyn Christian dominate USF’s Janette Bejlkova 6-2, 6-0.
With a visit from No. 22 Texas looming, the USC women’s tennis team knows it can’t afford anything less than an all-around dominating performance against the Bulls.
“We’re in a good place. We have some talent, though we don’t have a long with just seven girls on scholarship there isn’t too much room for error, we are ready to compete,” Gallien said.

For the last two weeks, there has been a sense that the season hung in the balance for the USC women’s basketball team.
Losing four out of five games will do that to a team. So will getting beat twice in a row on your home court. And after trailing for almost the entire first half against lowly Oregon State, the Women of Troy (14-8, 6-5) seemed closer to the precipice than they had all season.
Versatility · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath, pictured here against UCLA, recorded a double-double in a winning effort against Oregon State. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
But thanks to a dominant second half, USC righted the ship for the moment and escaped Corvallis with a 70-51 victory. The Women of Troy scored on eight of their first 10 possessions in the second half to grab a 44-42 lead they wouldn’t relinquish.
Sophomore forward Christina Marinacci played a critical role for USC during the run, coming up with a pair of offensive rebounds and putbacks.
After halftime, USC outscored Oregon State 44-19 cruising to a comfortable victory.  The Women of Troy shot 56 percent in the second half, compared to just 23 percent for the Beavers. USC finished the game shooting 48 percent from the field.  Oregon State ended the game shooting 30 percent.
“It was just a matter of us refocusing ourselves,” said junior guard Briana Gilbreath. “[The coaches] came into the locker room and said ‘Guys, we don’t know who that is out there playing’ and we didn’t know either. We had to buckle down and come out strong.”
Early on, it looked like USC was headed to its third consecutive loss. Hot outside shooting by the Beavers (8-15, 1-11), particularly by guard Alyssa Martin, helped Oregon State grab an early lead. USC trailed by double digits midway through the first half before clawing its way back into the game by halftime.
At the break, Oregon State — aided by Martin’s four three-pointers — lead 32-26.  Gilbreath led USC with nine points. Freshman forward Cassie Harberts added six points and redshirt senior guard Jacki Gemelos chipped in five points off the bench for the Women of Troy.
Both teams shot under 40 percent for the half, although Oregon State made seven three-pointers compared to just two from the Women of Troy. Most of the other statistics were even between the two teams.
A three-pointer by junior guard Ashley Corral moved her into the record books as the 23rd player in school history to score 1,000 points for her career. Corral’s fourth trifecta of the night moved her atop the career three-pointers list, with 184.
Earlier this season, Gilbreath became the 22nd player to reach 1,000 career points.
“It means a lot for both of us to be in the 1,000 point club,” Gilbreath said. “It shows a lot of dedication not just to the game but to USC. I’m grateful for both of us to be in this position.”
Gilbreath paced USC with 19 points and 13 rebounds. Corral added 14 points for the Women of Troy. Four other players scored at least eight points for USC. Martin led Oregon State with 18 points.
With the win, USC tied with Arizona State for third place in the conference. The Women of Troy lost a heartbreaker to the Sun Devils at home last month.
Next up for USC is a road date against Oregon. Tip off is scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday.

Agentgate. Anyone who is a fan of USC knows how improper contact between student-athletes, most notably Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo, and agents has negatively affected the athletic program, namely football and men’s basketball.
When the NCAA slammed USC with the scarlet letter of “lack of institutional control” last summer, it was obvious a change needed to be made.
So out went longtime athletic director Mike Garrett, who presided over the department that lacked control, and in stepped experienced lawyer, athlete and journalist Pat Haden.
Ever since Haden stepped foot on campus as athletic director, he can’t seem to do anything wrong. He has said all the right things and acted in the best interests of USC and its athletic teams.
Tuesday, Haden got it right again. For the first time ever, he assembled and held an agent awareness summit.
Haden, vice president of athletic compliance David Roberts and senior associate athletic director Mark Jackson were joined by NFL executive vice president of football operations Ray Anderson, NFL Players’ Association agent administration director Mark Levin, every Pac-10 athletic director, three agents and SEC commissioner Mike Slive attended.
The goal of the summit was for administrators to gather information about compliance practices at other institutions, and to investigate how to act in the best interests of the athletes, agents, university and everyone else associated with collegiate athletics.
In short, it became rather clear that Haden is proactively working with agents, the NCAA and student-athletes to ensure that everyone can get what they want without breaking the rules.
Haden said the summit caused him to take a new approach.
“The discussion was, ‘Hey, we’re kidding ourselves if we don’t believe in our heart that every one of these guys wants to go to the NFL or NBA,” Haden said at a press conference following the event. “I have been one that often starts with a negative, to say, ‘Hey, your odds of going to the NFL are remote.’ That’s not what they want to hear. We’re going to have to think how they think.”
Despite what people might want to believe, Haden is right in thinking that many student-athletes place sports as their biggest priority when attending college. They are majoring in their sport in hopes of becoming professional athletes as a student majors and practices engineering in hopes of becoming an engineer.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has stated in interviews that his number one goal is to make it to the NFL.
That is not at all suggesting he’s letting academics slide, but it just reinforces the idea that many athletes go to college, and especially USC, with the primary goal of making it to the next level.
Like it or not, agents are going to try to woo athletes because they are all potential clients. So with that frame of mind, Haden can use this summit to figure out how best to deal with agents.
I can give you a hint: It isn’t the way Alabama coach Nick Saban did when he called them “pimps” last summer. The notion that all agents are bad is false, as agents are a vital part of the transition to the next level for athletes, and as a result, USC shouldn’t be shooing them away, but rather ensuring proper contact is made.
Haden also hit the right note by inviting the representatives from the NFL and NFLPA to the summit, even though they have nothing to do with collegiate athletics, for there is a disconnect between the NCAA and pro sports.
Whether or not Haden did this to get brownie points with the NCAA as it weighs its ruling on USC’s appeal probably won’t be known. Although Julie Roe Lach, the NCAA’s vice president of enforcement, sounded positive in a statement about the summit, which she attended.
“[Senior associate athletic director] Mark Jackson and Pat Haden of USC are to be credited for bringing those groups to the table,” Lach said.
But nonetheless, I doubt any of this will have any effect on the ruling. It is another right step for Haden, however, as he looks to get ahead of the curve and restore USC’s winning ways.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team is looking to improve to 7-0 for the first time since 1991 against the No. 11 Pepperdine Waves.
The Trojans (6-0, 6-0) appear energized and focused coming off of a weeklong break.
Youth · 6-foot-5 sophomore outside hitter Maddison McKibben has provided a lift for USC and looks to become the team’s full-time starter. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
“It’s good that we got the tough road matches behind us,” said USC Volleyball Coach Bill Ferguson said. “We’re able to focus on ‘we’ instead of ‘them’ now. We can lift and train more so we get stronger as the season progresses rather than deteriorating, as well as get more guys more time on the court in practice.”
Senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy was also named AVCA Player of the Week for the second consecutive week.
“I don’t think much about it,” Troy said. “I’m surprised I got it again, especially with the rest of the guys playing so well.”
Troy needs only eight more kills to break the USC rally scoring record for career kills.
The Trojans have been impressive during the first leg of the season, dropping a total of two sets in the first six matches.
“I’m very pleased with our work ethic, attitude and maturity during this season,” Ferguson said. “And it all starts with their ‘we is greater than me’ attitude. The guys have been practicing that every day.”
The Trojans have been dominating their opponents both on offense and defense.
The Trojans are hitting at a .404 clip collectively, while opponents have only managed to kill at a .192 rate.
“We’ve been running a much faster offense this year as opposed to last year,” Troy said. “And it’s because the middles are so efficient that for us hitting on the outside, we only have to deal with one defender.”
The Trojans are also leading the conference in digs by a two-dig-per-set margin.
“We won’t wow teams with our blocking, but what’s more important is that we’re digging great,” Ferguson said. “We’re at 10-and-some-change per set and the next highest is at around eight.”
Pepperdine (3-5, 1-5), on the other hand, has been struggling as of late, losing two matches at the hands of UCLA and at UC Santa Barbara, and in five-set matches to Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge and UC Irvine.
The Waves feature four starting hitters that measure in at over 6-foot-7 including team kill leader Maurice Torres.
“Pepperdine is a big, physical team,” Ferguson said. “If they can find a way to match up with our hitters, it’ll be interesting.”
Despite Pepperdine’s size, senior outside hitter Riley McKibbin has looked to a vital advantage that the Trojans have shown as the season has progressed.
“Our unity is our biggest strength,” McKibbin said. “This is the most cohesive group I’ve played with in my career here. We’re really playing for each other out there.”
