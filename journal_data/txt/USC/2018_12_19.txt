USC football entered Wednesday’s Early National Signing Day in an unfamiliar position. The Trojans have been struggling to attract the best high school seniors, coming in at 25th in ESPN’s 2019 football class rankings. Wednesday’s events certainly didn’t shoot the Trojans up the rankings, but USC did leave with a few key victories as they welcomed 18 signees.
USC needed to shore up an offensive line that allowed 27 sacks in 2018, and succeeded with the signing of tackle Jason Rodriguez from Oak Hills High School in Hesperia, California. The four-star Rodriguez is USC’s highest-rated signee of the early period and boasts a monstrous 6-foot-6, 326-pound frame. The Trojans also added three-star offensive guard Tilini Livai from Narbonne in Harbor City.
“We were really excited to get this young man and what he brings to the table with size,” head coach Clay Helton said about Rodriguez. “He’s one that could step in and help us with depth immediately.”
The leading signee early in the day was four-star cornerback Max Williams from Junipero Serra High School in nearby Gardena. The second signee after three-star quarterback Kedon Slovis, Williams was not the only defensive back who signed with the Trojans. Three-star safety Briton Allen from IMG Academy in Florida will provide greater depth for a safety position that was depleted due to injuries in 2018, while three-star cornerback Trey Davis will come down from Washington to battle for playing time.
“One of the more special athletes, we thought, out of the city,” Helton said of Williams. “[He has] the ability to play corner or nickel and is very quick-twitch.”
The Trojans gained a pair of four-star tight ends in Jude Wolfe from St. John Bosco and Ethan Rae from Orange Lutheran. Both standing at least 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, the duo present new offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury with a greater number of red zone options moving forward. Helton said that he thought of both as among the best in the country at their position and that the team planned on using them as in-line tight ends because of their athleticism and ball skills.
USC also added to its strongest position: wide receiver. Four-star Drake London out of Moorpark should become a familiar face on campus as a two-sport recruit for both the football and basketball teams. Munir McClain, a three-star receiver from JSerra Catholic in San Juan Capistrano, will join his brother Abdul-Malik, who served as a freshman linebacker for the Trojans this season. Three-star running back Kenan Christon out of Madison High School in San Diego will join the talented group of running backs.
The Trojans added three linebackers to an already solid group. The highlight is four-star Maninoa Tufonu, who joins fellow Hawaiian freshman Palaie Gaoteote at inside linebacker. In addition, the Trojans secured three-star recruits Ralen Goforth from Bosco and Stanley Ta’ufo’ou from Grace Brethren in Simi Valley.
Four-star Centennial defensive end Drake Jackson’s announcement that he would be committing to USC rather than Pac-12 South rival Arizona State marked a huge win for a Trojan defensive line that sought to replace departing senior linebacker Porter Gustin. Three-stars Nick Figueroa out of Riverside C.C. and Gino Quinones out of Hawaii join Jackson at the defensive end.
“[He has] one of the unique body types that is out there, kind of a hybrid outside linebacker and defensive end,” Helton said about Jackson. “He can stand up or put his hand on the ground, he’s a really unique pass rusher.” 
Four-star running back Jordan Wilmore from Lawndale and three-star defensive tackle Dejon Benton from Pittsburg round out the Trojans’ early class, although Wilmore has not signed his letter of intent yet, according to 247 Sports.
ESPN now ranks USC’s 2019 class 23rd in the nation, still a far cry from the top-ten finishes of the last couple of years. Still without a five-star recruit, the Trojans are the favorites to secure a pair of top wide receivers in Mater Dei’s Bru McCoy and Orange Lutheran’s Kyle Ford.

Senior captain Bennie Boatwright watched a lot of film on Santa Clara before Tuesday’s matchup at Leavey Center. He wasn’t prepared for the onslaught that awaited them.
“I’ve never seen them play this well,” Boatwright said.
If USC thought it could waltz into Santa Clara for a much-needed win to snap out of a three-game losing skid, then it received much more than it bargained for. Instead of an expected easy win against an inferior WCC opponent, the Trojans fell in double overtime, 102-92, for their fourth straight loss.
Andy Enfield, in a game in during the 2016 season. USC’s head coach is searching for answers after it fell to Santa Clara on Tuesday for its fourth straight loss – Daily Trojan file photo.
USC had not lost to Santa Clara since 1984. More importantly, the loss continued a disturbing trend of defeats that has head coach Andy Enfield searching for answers as the Trojans fall below .500 for the first time this season.
“I don’t know what to say anymore,” Enfield said.
Not many of the 2,226 in attendance did, either, as they watched a Santa Clara team down to its third string center and with seven scholarship players available dominate USC early on and hold off several runs by the Trojans to pull out a double-overtime victory. Though the Trojans were shorthanded themselves, with eight scholarship players available — and freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr. not making the trip due to a quad contusion —  they still had a clear talent advantage on a Broncos squad that had not beaten anyone of consequence before Tuesday.
“I’m the head coach and it’s on me,” Enfield said. “I have to figure this out and my staff. There’s only one person to blame for this loss and that’s me.”
Defensive lapses felled the Trojans late, as they had leads in the final seconds of both regulation and the first overtime. With both Boatwright and junior forward Nick Rakocevic fouled out, USC was outscored 13-3 in double overtime. Santa Clara scored the game’s final 6 points to pull away.
USC trailed by as many as 16 points in the second half, but rallied to take an 80-79 lead on a layup by junior guard Jonah Mathews with 24 seconds left in regulation. But sophomore forward Jordan Usher lost track of his man on the ensuing Santa Clara possession, resulting in a foul and overtime after Santa Clara’s Josip Vrankic split two free throws.
In overtime, redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron made a pair of foul shots to put USC ahead 89-87 with 11 seconds to play, but Santa Clara’s Trey Wertz drove right past redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton for a game-tying layup to force double overtime.
“All of our guys have had equal opportunity to step up and make plays,” Enfield said, “so it is frustrating because we have some veteran guys on this team who have made crucial mistakes on offense and defense, especially in important parts of the game when the other team goes on runs.”
Wertz led all scorers with 28 points, and accounted for 11 of Santa Clara’s 13 points in double overtime. Usher had 22 points to lead the Trojans, while Mathews chipped in 20 points.
USC once again started off poorly, missing its first eight shots attempts and seven 3-point shots. The Trojans shot 38.7 percent from the field in the first half, while the Broncos were at nearly 60 percent and jumped out to a 42-31 lead at halftime. Against Oklahoma on Saturday, the Trojans began the game shooting 1-of-9 from the field.
“It’s a common thing,” Boatwright said. “We do it every single game. We come out slow and we have to claw our way back.”
Enfield hinted at potentially making changes to the starting lineup, and called out his veterans for the sluggish openings.
“In our starting lineup, we have some guys who’ve been around a lot, and that shouldn’t happen,” he said.
Though the Trojans came to life in the second half, shooting nearly 50 percent, the hole they dug themselves in the first half was too deep to climb out of. And they were not going to win, according to Enfield, shooting 5-of-28 from the 3-point line. If USC’s previous three losses — which came by an average of 19 points — were not wake-up calls, losing to a team picked to finish second-to-last in the WCC this season serves as the fire alarm going off, if the Trojans want any hope of a successful 2018-2019 campaign.
“We’ve got to figure out how to put our guys in position to win games,” Enfield said. “We’ll keep at it.”
