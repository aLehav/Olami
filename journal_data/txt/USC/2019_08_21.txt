At the heart of the dichotomy between USC’s wealthy and elite status and the frequent feelings of neglect many of its students have endured is a trend that has taken hold throughout the country: the higher education arms race — universities’ growing propensity to spend lavishly on superficial sources of appeal like non-academic facilities, campus beautification and famous faculty and lecturers that signal wealth and prestige but have minimal effect on students’ educational experience. 
During C. L. Max Nikias’ presidency, USC time and again proved its full-throated embrace of the higher education arms race. From 2010 to 2018 alone, USC fully renovated the Lyon Center and the Heritage Hall athletics complex, and it opened the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The University hired former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former U.S. Army general David Petraeus as faculty members, two men who had no experience in higher education at the time they were hired and have not taught regularly since. USC opened the Tutor Campus Center, which has some academic utility with a few classrooms and lecture halls on the second floor but boasts a campus dining center and a large indoor event space as its primary features. And it finished construction of USC Village, perhaps the University’s greatest example of ostentatious spending, complete with retailers, high-end restaurants and a host of other new amenities.
In statements announcing these projects and amenities, the administration, in addition to touting them as signifiers of USC’s prominence and growth, usually emphasized that generous donations that helped bring them to fruition. 
Even if, for the sake of argument, all the aforementioned projects were completely funded by donations — and not at all by students’ tuition and fees — their status as one of USC’s institutional priorities over the past decade must come to an end. 
USC, like any major institution, has a large but finite pool of financial resources and its success is largely dependent on what it uses those resources to invest in. 
These unworthy priorities consumes resources — to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars — that could be allocated to financial aid, adequate pay for adjunct faculty, more modern classrooms and other investments that directly affect students’ academic experience at USC. 
Even though many major donors make their contributions for specified causes, the administration still wields major influence by deciding what initiatives the University’s fundraising campaigns are geared toward.
Moreover, USC’s lavish spending on campus beautification and amenities bolsters the perception that it prioritizes style over substance. It fuels students’ frustrations that the University obsesses over prestige-signalling at the expense of caring for its students.
Instead, USC must put those resources into its most important stakeholders — students. 
If President Carol Folt truly wants to turn USC around, her first step should be to reevaluate the University’s participation in the higher education arms race. USC must be a school for its students, not a school for donors and elitism.

If you were to ask us last semester what the Daily Trojan Lifestyle section was about, we would have probably said “…anything!” Previously dominated by movie, album, concert and TV show reviews, the Lifestyle section was indicative of mainstream popular culture nationwide. From covering newly-released Netflix specials to writing about Coachella, Lifestyle encompassed stories directed to a universal audience.
Now, we’re turning a new leaf, shifting our focus, changing our name. 
Although we often covered USC arts and entertainment initiatives, our decision to change our name harkens back to our focus and dedication to this campus. We realized we were not embracing what was so unique about our university — we instead tried to appeal to a larger audience, an audience that could easily find similar stories at countless other outlets. But what better stories to cover than the ones that take place on our campus, that cater to our communities and impact our students? We want to make sure our main readership feels represented, highlighted and uplifted. We want to pay homage to our student-led art initiatives, up-and-coming artists, dancers, designers, playwrights, performers and musicians. We want to be more USC-centric, covering on-campus events, performances and exhibitions.
That is why, with the first issue of the Fall 2019 Semester, we are setting a standard of covering stories that are particularly applicable to USC students. By exploring Visions and Voices initiatives, such as their social justice-oriented and community-driven Arts in Action program, to interviewing USC alumna and rapper Saweetie, we hope to shed light on our thriving arts community. We strive to continue a trend of encouraging artistic growth and engagement within our campus.
Although we will continue to cover culturally relevant and salient artistic endeavors which pique all college students’ interests, we want our section to stand out from other competing newspapers, to embrace what is unique about our school. USC is a top-tier artistic campus — we have a myriad of artists making great things right under our noses — our newspaper should be a platform for our artists to elevate themselves. 
Arts & Entertainment, our new brand, will put USC creatives first. Our section will, first and foremost, cover our inspiration, our muses, our struggles and our triumphs. It will follow the trials and tribulations of student artists finding their passion and showcasing their projects. 
As we rebrand, we want to encourage students to reach out to us about their artistic endeavors. We are calling on you, our artists, to share your stories, experiences and projects. We ask that you help us redefine our muse and rebuild our section from the “campus up.”

When Dr. Carol Folt sits at her desk in the Bovard Administration Building, she has an unobstructed view of Alumni Park — she can see every student who walks, bikes or skates past. Unlike Bovard’s recognizable brick walls that tower over campus, Folt seems grounded in her first-floor office, a space complete with tall, white walls and nearly floor-to-ceiling windows. 
The shelves in her office sit empty, though Folt’s daily schedule as she transitions into her new role as USC’s 12th president is anything but. From meeting with deans and campus custodians to speaking with student leaders and the Board of Trustees, Folt has made it her goal to meet members of the Trojan community from every corner of campus.
 Folt officially assumed the presidency July 1, just one of a few milestones that have marked her transformative summer. 
The new title of president is impressive, but Folt now bears a more personal one too: She’s become a grandmother. Her daughter, Tessa, welcomed her first child earlier this summer. 
“She’s got to be dressed as a little Trojan when she comes here for the inauguration,” Folt said excitedly.
While her first few months in office were flush with new beginnings, they were also paradoxically marked by familiarity. Folt has spent time researching and learning about campus culture and tradition, but she is no stranger to leading a major university through times of crisis. 
Her career path is characterized by historic firsts — after serving as provost and interim president at Dartmouth College, Folt was named the first woman chancellor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill in 2013. She made history again when she was named USC’s first permanent woman president in its 139-year history. 
It comes as no surprise that her decorated career played a role in her unanimous vote-in by the Board of Trustees, but her experience dealing with national scrutiny and campus controversies are what makes her most qualified to inherit a University that would especially benefit from her fortitude. 
When Folt took over as chancellor of North Carolina’s flagship university, the circumstances weren’t dissimilar to those she faces now. UNC had just seen an extensive 18-year academic scheme that allowed student athletes to take fraudulent “paper classes” in which students rarely met in person and professors inflated grades. Under Folt, the university faced public outrage, sanctions from the NCAA and an independent investigation from federal prosecutors.
 In January, UNC’s Board of Governors asked Folt to resign, months earlier than she had planned. The action came days after Folt’s decision to remove the pedestal where “Silent Sam,” a campus Confederate statue, once stood. The statue caused turmoil at UNC last fall, with students protesting and ultimately taking down the statue themselves. 
While some applauded Folt for her boldness, many thought her decision came far too late. 
In a March 2019 editorial from the Daily Tar Heel, UNC’s student newspaper, the editorial board described “major issues with her and her administration’s lack of transparency,” during the Silent Sam controversy and her handling of the NCAA scandal. However, the editorial also encouraged USC to remain optimistic that her six years at UNC taught her some valuable lessons. 
Equipped with this experience, Folt takes the seat of presidency during one of the most trying times in USC’s history. In the past three years, the University has found itself in the national spotlight several times, as it faced controversy after controversy.
 In 2017, former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito was found to have used illicit drugs while seeing patients. Since 2018, over 700 women have accused former campus gynecologist George Tyndall of sexual abuse. And earlier this year, an FBI investigation revealed that wealthy parents bribed athletic officials at several high-tier universities, including USC, to admit their children using fake athletic profiles. Also this year, nearly 50 students and alumni claimed they were abused by former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly. 
Along with the myriad missteps that plague the University, the halls of Bovard saw many faces in the past few years. After former president C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation in 2018, Wanda Austin assumed the interim presidency. Provost Michael Quick, Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs Carol Mauch Amir all stepped down in the past semester.
 And yet, Folt’s grand office in Bovard seems free from any reminders of the University’s turbulent past and uncertain present. Bright light pours into the room, giving the space an airy, open glow. The light seemed to match Folt’s attitude in her new role — her readiness to roll up her sleeves, remain honest and transparent and begin the work that needs to be done to start a fresh chapter for the University.
Though Folt is the first woman president at USC, she views the role as the collective accomplishment of female leaders who have come before her. 
“You feel [a] responsibility to make sure that the next person has an easier time and the person after that,” Folt said. “I love the fact that I can do things in a slightly different way and highlight issues of particular importance to me, and some of those will be issues that are important to women.” 
Not only does Folt bring a unique perspective to the table as USC’s first female leader, but she also believes that her career as an educator and environmentalist influences her leadership and priorities. 
After transferring to UC Santa Barbara from community college, Folt graduated with a degree in aquatic biology in 1976. Folt went on to pursue her master’s degree and eventually her doctorate in ecology from UC Davis. While both of her parents were chemists, and she always had an inclination toward science, she began college without any clear idea of what she wanted to study. 
“I really give my parents a lot of credit in that they never really were telling me I needed to pick,” Folt said. “They were very open about, ‘Whatever you do, you can do.’ But they were always adamant that education was the real pathway to go forward.” 
Folt fondly recalls, however, that when taking classes in different fields to discover what she wanted to pursue, she briefly wanted to be an artist. Some of her first university classes were in art, and to this day, Folt said her love of creative thinking is a huge part of her life. 
Though she never pursued that dream professionally, she said her love for biology was informed by the same sense of curiosity and wonder that drove her to art.
 “I felt that magical feeling you [feel] when you are at the edge of what is known,” Folt said of her introduction to the subject at UCSB. “They started having us think, even as first year students, ‘I can be a part of something nobody’s ever done before, and I can really get involved in something that is the creation of something completely new.’”
 After finishing her own time as a student, Folt dedicated her life to educating others.
 Folt joined Dartmouth College in 1983 as a research instructor and went on to become the dean of graduate studies in 2001. At her core, she believes she is a teacher first, no matter what. Her teaching style has never emphasized lecturing, and she believes that instead of being a “sage on the stage,” collaborative learning is the most effective way to approach education. 
“There’s a lot of facts you teach in science, but what I learned in science is changing so rapidly,” Folt said. “When you are in fields like this that are changing all the time, you learn very quickly that the way to teach is not to think you know, but to bring people in and … listen to them.”
 These strategies — collaborative learning, effective listening — are not limited to the classroom. Folt hopes to bring them to her tenure as president to ensure students feel represented at the University. 
Folt’s environmentalism has informed her goals for the University as well. From the day she was announced as USC’s president, Folt made sustainability on campus one of her priorities. She says she’ll work with students to foster conversations on campus exploring more environmentally-minded practices. 
“I know that most of you feel that if we don’t do something, [our] planet is not going to be in good condition,” Folt said. “This is the time when we need to start taking action. This is the time when we need to teach every generation how to create a more sustainable world.”
 Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone echoed that sentiment. He believes that growing the University’s Office of Sustainability and focusing on the Sustainability 2028 Plan, which aims to provide a “greenprint” for advancing long-term sustainability, are key for the University’s future. 
“We have been able to compile a briefing document … about the status of USC, our plans for the 2028 plan,” Stone said. “[Folt] has been pretty involved in that, and that’s probably the thing I am most excited about to see in the near future.”
With the new era, Folt is looking forward to a change of seasons. The first few weeks of the semester will be undoubtedly busy, and Folt is excited for the rush of a new school year. Though she has met with many members of the community since July — she is the first president to meet with members of USC Facilities Management — she hopes to balance merely listening to community concerns with taking action.
 “I am impatient, and I want to get started on the things that we want to do together,” she laughed. “You almost have to hold yourself back a little bit. Every meeting I go to, I come away with a set of new things I’ve learned about the institution and a set of new things I want to work on.” 
At a time when progress seems stunted and trust in the administration is low, repairing and rebuilding the University is a grueling task. But for Folt, moving forward is the only viable path. 
“It’s not like this is a new job [for her],” Board of Trustees chairman Rick Caruso said. “She knows the issues and understands the dynamics on campus. What I’m most excited about is that there is an enthusiasm and so many positive things happening on campus that are continuing to move [us] forward.”
 Folt wants to prioritize accessibility and ensure equity for all students — from study abroad programs and internships to financial aid and graduation rates, Folt’s leadership is strictly student-oriented. 
Though the University grants over $350 million in financial aid from its own sources and 21% of USC students receive Pell Grants, Folt sees room to improve accessibility at USC. Even in the face of a University that boasts a $5.5 billion endowment and ranks as the 21st richest University in the country, inequality persists. 
  “Every meeting I go to, I come away with a set of new things I’ve learned about the institution and a set of new things I want to work on.” 
In March, the FBI disclosed its investigation into 50 wealthy, high-profile parents who collectively paid millions of dollars to alter their children’s standardized test scores, bribe university officials and create fake athletic profiles to admit their children into elite schools across the U.S. USC was at the forefront of the scandal, with the highest number of incidents of misconduct among universities implicated in the scheme. 
Responding to the ensuing outrage, Austin announced a series of reforms, including reconsidering the status of students admitted through the scheme and increasing oversight for athletics admissions. Austin has since left office, leaving Folt to carry on the changes. 
Folt strongly believes that shared governance is key to building transparency and trust between students, faculty, staff and administrators in addressing the University’s controversies. 
“It’s one thing just to say transparency, but you need to actually understand what that means to people,” Folt said. “Sometimes transparency means actually being heard and I don’t think everyone expects that every single thing that they say is being acted on, but they want to know they’re getting a fair hearing.”
 Stone hopes that Folt’s priority is to analyze and critique the areas where the University has failed. He emphasizes that USC is in need of a refocus — away from fundraising and climbing the ranks toward values-based leadership. 
“Just the dialogue that Dr. Folt is using is promising, but I think the biggest thing is just making sure that there is follow-through,” Stone said. “She will really set a tone and a culture at USC that will hopefully impact the University in a positive way.”
 As a part of that new tone and culture, Folt is building a renewed University administration. She tapped former UNC officials Winston Crisp and Felicia Washington as vice president for student affairs and senior vice president of human resources, respectively, and brought on communications expert Glenn Osaki as the University’s chief communications officer. 
“Carol is demanding excellence from everybody that she has been bringing in, whether they are from Chapel Hill or someplace else,” Caruso said. “She wants to surround herself with talented people, with the interests of students in mind.” 
The beginning of every school year signals a fresh start. But this year, that fresh start feels particularly significant. 
As students unpack boxes, move furniture and hang USC pennants on new dorm walls, Folt is also moving in: This fall, she’ll likely fill the shelves of her office, discover cherished campus traditions and take her granddaughter, donned in cardinal and gold, to a Trojan football game. 
But a fresh start doesn’t erase a difficult past. The USC community seems optimistic for Folt’s presidency, but cautiously so. Folt will begin a new and unique chapter in USC’s history — one that she has yet to write.

When Wanda Austin became USC’s interim president in August 2018, her goal was simple — she wanted to talk with University stakeholders to begin addressing the problems USC had faced leading up to former President C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation. 
“You have to learn,” Austin told the Daily Trojan when she started last year. “You have to take the time to get the benefit of your team, to make sure you’re engaging them so that you can make decisions that give you the best chance at a positive outcome.”
Austin took on the interim role to move the University forward after Nikias’ tumultuous reign, which was marked by unprecedented financial growth but plagued by scandals. In his final two years as president, a Los Angeles Times investigation published in July 2017 revealed that former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito had allegedly used drugs while seeing patients. Another investigation in May 2018 had revealed decades of sexual misconduct and abuse at the hands of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall.
In its resolve to move forward, USC has faced a number of setbacks, and the national spotlight placed upon campus has only mounted pressure on a struggling administration. 
However, what initially seemed like a time of growth was severely stunted in March when news broke of the University’s involvement in the largest college admissions scandal in history.
The FBI in March released a 200-page investigation detailing a college admissions scheme that revealed that 50 celebrities, executives and officials allegedly paid large sums of money to have their children admitted to USC, Yale and Stanford, among other colleges. Of the 12 universities that were indicted, USC had the largest number of students admitted as false athletic recruits and was the only school where an athletics official was involved.
“We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the University,” USC wrote in a statement in March. “USC is conducting an internal investigation.”
In the immediate aftermath of the report, Austin wrote to the University community that the administration would fully cooperate with law enforcement and enact immediate changes. 
“The board, all of us, are obviously very disappointed in what happened,” Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said then. “It is incredibly unthinkable in my opinion, of what these parents did with these administrators and these coaches.”
In response to the investigation, USC terminated Senior Assistant Athletic Director Donna Heinel in March, along with water polo coach Jovan Vavic — both athletic officials who facilitated the scheme. The University also began investigating each student admitted through the scheme to determine their status. It also announced reforms for the athletic admissions process to include more oversight from coaches and other officials. 
In addition to the college admissions scheme, the University has also received criticism for how it handled the case against Tyndall, who was recently arrested and charged with 18 counts of sexual penetration of an unconscious person and 11 counts of sexual battery by fraud. 
Tyndall, who formerly worked as a gynecologist at the student health center, has been accused of sexually abusing and harassing current and former students. The Times discovered Tyndall targeted Asian and international students during health appointments and unsealed documents that showed USC had known about complaints made against Tyndall for decades. 
The Los Angeles Police Department said in June that this was the largest sex crime case they had ever seen.  Currently, there are over 700 plaintiffs suing Tyndall and USC in both state and federal court. 
In October 2018, USC agreed to a $215 million settlement that would distribute tiered compensation to all former patients, not only alleged victims, and require USC to implement a number of campus-wide reforms including an expansion of student health resources.
USC’s Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Services, which has been headed by Brenda Ingram since September, started a bystander training initiative and the Engemann Student Health Center unveiled plans for a fifth floor dedicated to mental health resources last semester.
“I am encouraged by [the] settlement filing, which takes another important step in healing our community,” Austin wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan in February. “Every affected individual is a member of the Trojan Family, and we care deeply about their well-being.”
Tyndall, however, is not the only former campus doctor to have been accused of alleged sexual assault. There is currently a growing lawsuit against the University and former campus men’s sexual health doctor Dennis Kelly, alleging that he sexually abused and targeted gay and bisexual men. The plaintiffs also allege that the University knew about Kelly’s actions and failed to act. 
The University announced it would offer free counseling services to former health center patients following the L.A. Times investigation of Tyndall and a BuzzFeed News article from August that detailed the experiences of some of Kelly’s victims. 
Now, all eyes are on newly-appointed President Carol Folt, who stepped into her role in July and inherited a University tormented by misaction. 
“I believe so deeply in what [USC] has done and what it can do,” Folt said at a March press conference announcing her presidency. “I also have learned that you take on challenges by never forgetting your bigger mission and the good things that happen. It’s that pairing that I think brings the vibrancy. If we have no challenges, it just means no one’s finding [them].”
With Folt come other new faces to the University’s administration, including USC’s first Senior Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington, who worked alongside Folt at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Winston Crisp, who worked as Folt’s vice chancellor at UNC, will be the vice president for student affairs. 
Other appointees include Senior Vice President for Administration David Wright and Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Glenn Osaki. 
The University also announced in July that Geoffrey Garrett will serve as the new Marshall School of Business dean following Austin’s controversial termination of former dean James Ellis. Garrett, who formerly led the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, will join USC in Fall 2020. Current Interim Dean Gareth James will serve as such until then. USC said Ellis was terminated due to a buildup of alleged discrimination complaints among students against Marshall staff. 
Folt’s time in North Carolina was also defined by how she dealt with university issues. When she took over as chancellor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the school found itself in the national spotlight for allowing athletes to enroll in “paper classes” that kept them academically eligible to play. 
Coming into a University facing an athletic scandal, Folt told the Daily Trojan in March that she believes her previous experience, including an NCAA investigation following “paper classes” that allowed Chapel Hill athletes to remain academically eligible, will help her guide the University forward. 
“There are so many wonderful things about [athletics] that are important,” she said. “Yet, we have the same obligation [to investigate]. If we’re gonna do it, we’re gonna do it right. So I’ve learned a lot [from the UNC scandal].”
Looking ahead at the school year, Folt said in March that she was excited to take on her new role at USC and help point the University in the right direction.
“Sometimes when you have challenges, you are in the best position to make change,” Folt said. “I haven’t heard any voice of complacency … No one is saying, ‘Everything is perfect, don’t tell us we have to change.’”

Following a disappointing 5-7 season that left fans clamoring for change, USC football may finally have what it takes to turn things around under new offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Graham Harrell. 
After USC capped off a terrible season by blowing a 10-point lead to visiting Notre Dame, major staff changes were inevitable. The Trojans, who finished 83rd in total offense per the NCAA, announced offensive coordinator Tee Martin wouldn’t return and wasted no time in hiring former Texas Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury as his replacement. 
Unfortunately for the Trojans, Kingsbury was offered the head coaching job for the Arizona Cardinals in January and decided to leave college football for the NFL. 
Later that month, head coach Clay Helton announced Harrell’s hiring. The former North Texas offensive coordinator is known for his shotgun Air Raid offense that features frequent audibles and is often run without huddling before snapping the ball. 
Although the consensus is that sophomore quarterback JT Daniels will lead Harrell’s offense in USC’s Aug. 31 opener against Fresno State, the Trojans have plenty of depth at one of the game’s most crucial positions. Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis has been a pleasant surprise in fall camp, displaying both arm strength and accuracy. 
“Kedon’s a special talent,” Harrell said. “His arm, when that ball comes out of his hand, it looks different. That’s what it’s supposed to look like.” 
Perhaps the strongest position group for the Trojans this season will be wide receiver. Sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown is coming off a 60-reception season, while senior Michael Pittman Jr. averaged 69 receiving yards per game last year. Harrell’s offensive scheme should allow one of the Pac-12’s best receiving corps to make an even greater impact this season. 
But USC will need more than just a revamped offense to return to college football dominance. Defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast leads a unit that must make significant improvements to avoid another disastrous showing. 
After allowing just the fifth most passing yards per game in the Pac-12 last season, USC will have to overcome the losses of cornerbacks Ajene Harris and Iman Marshall, as well as safety Marvell Tell III, to the NFL. 
Sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin has impressed in fall camp and will be counted on to provide some relief along with cornerbacks freshman Chris Steele and redshirt freshman Isaac Taylor-Stuart. While the Trojans have several talented young defensive backs that could make a positive impact, the inexperienced group is likely headed for some growing pains early on. 
“[Our offense] took advantage of some freshman corners at times,” Helton said after a fall practice. “They’ll learn from it, and they’ll come back and they’ll be even better.” 
The success of USC’s defense is likely to come from its strong defensive line. Redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Jay Tufele, who picked up 23 tackles and three sacks last year, is poised to replace departed linebacker Porter Gustin as the biggest threat in USC’s front seven — though freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson has announced his arrival in spring camp and is sure to make his presence felt this fall. 
Defensive linemen redshirt sophomore Marlon Tuipulotu and redshirt senior Christian Rector led returning Trojans with 4.5 sacks each in 2018 and add to a group that needs to improve after allowing 164.4 yards per game in the Pac-12 last year — the fourth most in the conference. 
Whether USC will be able to make sufficient defensive strides remains to be seen — but if Jackson has anything to say about it, the group doesn’t lack confidence. He told the Los Angeles Times in April that the defense would make offenses “feel it” this season. 
After committing 96 penalties for 73.6 yards per game last year — worst and second-to-worst in the Pac-12, respectively — USC must avoid shooting itself in the foot, a burden which will fall heavily on the shoulders of the defense. 
With that in mind, the team has brought out referees to its fall practices, hoping to help a young squad avoid careless mistakes once the season begins. 
“Obviously, it’s great having the refs out here,” Helton said. “They alert us to exactly when the flags are being thrown and what we’re doing, and [we’re] getting real -time information.” 
Helton’s seat is as hot as ever even before the season kicks off, and a challenging first half of the Trojans’ schedule will go a long way in determining his future with the program. The Trojans, who have historically dominated at home but dropped their final three games at the Coliseum last year, face three tough home matchups against Fresno State, Stanford and Utah in the first four weeks before hitting the road for two brutal contests against Washington and Notre Dame. 
USC needs to use the first six games to prove it can compete with some of the nation’s top schools, or the demands from impatient Trojan fans calling for Helton’s removal will grow even louder. 
Many different factors on both sides of the ball have to improve for the Trojans to compete for a Pac-12 title this year, but there is reason to believe that USC football will return to its usual lofty standards sooner rather than later. 
Either way, 2019 is bound to be a pivotal year for Trojan football.

I remember walking onto USC’s campus for the first time as an optimistic, first-generation freshman. During the first few weeks, everything about this school seemed perfect to me: the dining hall food was great, my roommates were really nice and I loved my classes. Everything was simple.
I eagerly joined the campus paper in my first semester, ready to interview students like me, who came from backgrounds underrepresented on campuses like USC. I wanted that to be the focus of my time writing at the newspaper.
Quite quickly, that optimism faded and the opportunity to write about these communities began to diminish as I became more involved with reporting on the University and its administration. I started seeing the darker side of the school I was so proud to be a part of. The names of defamed, powerful people, as opposed to the names of talented students, were printed in our pages more often than any of us ever wanted.
We couldn’t go a single issue without seeing the names of Carmen Puliafito, Rohit Varma, Erick Guerrero, David Carrera, Tony Bland, George Tyndall, Dennis Kelly and Donna Heinel popping out from the pages. 
After reporting on these individuals for so long, our newsroom has memorized their stories.  We’ve spent countless hours writing and reporting on the tainted mark they left on our University. Regardless, they don’t represent the beautiful community I know exists at USC.
Now, our beloved University is starting a new era with Carol Folt, its first woman president, at the helm. Our troubled history hasn’t been erased, but we’re ready for change. 
It’s a historic time to be a Trojan, and the optimistic feeling I had when I first walked down Trousdale Parkway is slowly coming back. 
As I start my new role as the editor-in-chief of one of the country’s longest-standing college newspapers, I’ll strive to lead this paper with the optimism and excitement that I had as a freshman but with the experience that I’ve built reporting on USC, its community and its missteps.
Just as we expect the University to put its students before wealth and prestige, at the Daily Trojan, we will also put the the stories of our students first.
The Daily Trojan’s inaugural Fall 2019 issue is a reflection of that. In it, we highlight the fresh face of our renewed administration, which says it’ll keep students at the forefront, while still reminding us of the tumultuous few years that came before. We also showcase some of our incredible student athletes, including goalkeeper Kaylie Collins who has led the women’s soccer team to new heights, and profile up-and-coming rapper Saweetie, who once walked the halls of our University and is now a rising woman rapper in the industry.
Like USC, the Daily Trojan is also turning a page. 
After a handful of years riddled with burnout and sleepless nights, we’ve created a “Wellness and Outreach” department to ensure all of our editors and reporters feel safe and healthy as they do their job. We also hope to emphasize wellness in our coverage. Our wellness and outreach director penned a letter about her goals for the department, which you can read here.
We’ve also renamed the “Lifestyle” section “Arts & Entertainment.” Our readers will see an upgrade in content and a focus on talented artists, musicians and creatives that get their start at USC. The section’s name better reflects the content we hope to include. Our A&E editors also wrote a letter titled “Calling All Artists,” as a reminder that the stories you’ll read are by students, for students and about students.
There’s no place on campus I’d rather spend time at than STU 421, writing and editing the pages of a newspaper that I love and cherish. I hope that with my new role — and my background as a Latinx, gay son of undocumented immigrants — I can work to ensure that our diverse and vibrant campus is represented within the Daily Trojan, and that the stories we came here to write will come to life in this newspaper’s pages.
The Daily Trojan is ready for this new beginning, and we hope the students who read this newspaper are too.

The newly renovated Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will open its doors to visitors on Aug. 24, just in time for the Los Angeles Rams’ first preseason home game and USC’s first home game against Fresno State Aug. 31.
The stadium held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Aug. 15 attended by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, USC president Carol Folt, athletic director Lynn Swann and head football coach Clay Helton.
“When I walked down that tunnel, the hair on the back of my neck stood up because I knew I was in a place of history,” Helton said of his team’s first practice at the stadium Aug. 9.
The first major renovation to the stadium since 1995, the $315 million project features enhancements including a more spacious layout with new and fewer seats, stadium-wide Wi-Fi and an improved sound and video system. Other restorations include the stadium’s concrete walls and concourse, the bowl-shape and its iconic peristyle.
Before USC signed its 2013 agreement to maintain the structural integrity of the stadium until the year 2111, only a few renovations had been made to modernize or restore the well-known structures.
“The project itself, the overall project to modernize us … makes us as fine a stadium as there is,”  said Joe Furin, the Coliseum’s general manager. “This is a 96-year-old building. It had been neglected prior to the University taking over management of it.”
The renovation resulted in the removal of 12.4% of the bowl surface to make room for the Scholarship Club Tower, a seven-story addition that will feature new food options, press boxes, premium seating, a rooftop lounge and 24 luxury suites, which can be purchased on 20-year terms. 
With the Scholarship Club Tower, the stadium’s seating capacity has been reduced from 92,348 to 77,500 to remove seats that were inadequate in offering a full perspective of the playing field, according to the Conceptual Historic Fabric Retention Plan. The plan also stated that the decrease in seats was crucial in bringing Trojan fans closer to the  field. 
According to sophomore kicker Alex Stadthaus, after a season that saw a typically-full Coliseum never reach 60,000 fans in any of USC’s home games, the closer, tighter audience perspective could go a long way in creating a good atmosphere for the team. 
“The more fans that are there, the better it is for us,” Stadthaus said. “Our team thrives off people playing together and cheering us on. Whenever there’s more support behind Troy, there’s definitely a reason to be excited for a game versus when you’re walking into a stadium that [appears] only 60% full.”
Furin said a refurbished Coliseum, along with Trojan success on the gridiron, will bring fans back to the stadium’s seats and dramatically improve the attendance numbers that dropped significantly during a disappointing 2018 season. 
“It’s a little bit of both, the product on the field, but it’s also the venue,” Furin said. “We would encourage everyone to come out and experience it for yourself — and, knock on wood, [with the renovations] plus the play on the field — attendance is going to rise again.”
Wi-Fi will also be a feature of the newly renovated Coliseum, and two high-definition video boards have been installed on each end of the stadium. 
“I’m looking forward to getting Wi-Fi, that’s the main thing,” said Aqua Richards, a junior majoring in biochemistry and global studies. “Every time I go there, I would have to use data. The Wi-Fi is a huge plus.”
Despite the Coliseum’s much-needed enhancements, the project was accompanied by controversy. United Airlines and USC faced public backlash earlier this year regarding their agreement to rename the Coliseum the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum.
“Unlike other modern sports venues, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is not just a stadium — it is a war memorial,” said Janice Hahn, president of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission. “Removing ‘Los Angeles’ and replacing it with a corporate sponsor insults the memories of those the Coliseum was intended to honor.”
However, after heavy deliberation, the University and United settled on “United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum” as a means of balancing United’s title rights with the Coliseum’s standing as a World War I memorial.
According to Richards, both parties did an effective job in retaining the historical and memorial aspects of the original name while also acknowledging United Airlines’ help in funding an undisclosed but significant amount of the renovation project. 
“I think they did a great job in preserving the name because everyone’s still going to call it the Coliseum anyway,” Richards said. “I’m happy they still added the ‘Memorial Coliseum’ part in there for the veterans because it’s what everyone knows it as.”
Stadthaus said that while it was important to preserve the stadium’s identity as a war memorial, the University was right to welcome United’s assistance in the renovation. 
“I thought they did a great job in instilling a historical aspect as well as being able to make the deal occur,” Stadthaus said. “Anytime that the corporation is offering hundreds of millions of dollars to the school just to put a name on a building, I think it’s definitely worth consideration.”
Considering its historic nature, it was imperative for officials leading the project to maintain its well-known characteristics while modernizing the facility to provide an ideal fan experience. 
“How do you do a renovation, how do you modernize a stadium without jeopardizing that national historic designation?” Furin said. “You have to walk a very fine line between disrupting those character features and being able to bring things in.”
The project accordingly made a concerted effort to maintain the old-fashioned feel that has made it a staple of Los Angeles sports for nearly 100 years. 
“Its history, when it was built, and over the years of all the wonderful events we’ve hosted, parallels the growth of the city of Los Angeles in and of itself,” Furin said. “Starting with the 1932 Olympics, every major event that happened in this city took place here. If you wanted to see Sandy Koufax, if you wanted to see the Fearsome Foursome play, if you came with your grandfather and your father, and you were bringing your son, you came here to the Coliseum. So that’s one of the very special things about the facility.”
After the newest slate of renovations, Furin hopes that the stadium will remain the stomping grounds for Trojan players, students and fans for decades to come.
“We have an unbelievable legacy of a century of great events and moments, and with the University’s commitment, there’s going to be another century ahead of us,” Furin said. “That’s humbling to think about.”

Kaylie Collins didn’t know that her sumo suit was wildly inappropriate given the situation. It was Halloween 2017 and the USC women’s soccer team had arrived at McAlister Field for practice. None of the players knew that head coach Keidane McAlpine was angry at the team. Collins, possibly weighed down by her costume, got on the field just after her teammates — by then, it was too late. 
“I run out in my sumo suit and everyone is looking at me like ‘Kaylie, no,’” Collins said, laughing. “And I’m like ‘Guys, it’s Halloween!’ I’m jumping up and down in my sumo suit, and then we all get in a circle two minutes later and we find out we’re just going to run the whole practice.” 
Despite her poor timing, Collins’ friendliness and energy was well-received by the team. 
In fact, it’s one of the unifying forces on a Trojan squad that has been one of the best in the nation since she arrived in 2016. The redshirt junior goalkeeper is already accomplished on the field — she was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman team in 2017 and was the Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year last season — but perhaps her biggest impact has come from her role as a supportive teammate and leader. 
For example, in another Halloween episode the next year, Collins and senior midfielder Daria Petredes dressed up as McAlpine and associate head coach Jason Lockhart. She was unfazed by the previous year’s debacle and her bravery paid off, earning McAlpine’s seal of approval for the costumes. 
After redshirting as a true freshman in 2016, Collins was named the team’s culture committee leader in 2017, a role she still holds today. Her job is to create an enjoyable atmosphere for everyone on the team, with special attention placed on making new players feel welcome. It says a lot about Collins’ enthusiastic personality that a redshirt freshman was put in charge of team chemistry, and McAlpine said it was a perfect fit from the beginning. 
“She’s easy to talk to, very welcoming, great energy, super friendly,” McAlpine said. “So it lends itself well for those younger players and new players coming into the team to have an upperclassman, in particular one who has excelled and done so well on the field, to have that person be the one to welcome you and give you that much attention. It puts them at ease and helps them start off the right way.” 
McAlpine believes that Collins’ ability to galvanize her teammates comes from her experience growing up in a tight-knit family. Though Collins is from a small town in Northern California called Clayton, she welcomes plenty of fans at every game since she holds close relationships with her extended family in Southern California. 
Collins said she would love to be a role model for the younger girls in her family who play soccer; she enjoys seeing her little cousins at her games and has her 10-year-old sister Kelsey time her when she works out back home. 
“Family is huge, and it’s the same thing as having a teammate come out and time you,” Collins said. “I think everyone on this team has that switch in their brain where they’ve come from tight-knit families, they get on this team and they treat it like one.” 
Senior midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre joined the program at the same time as Collins and is also part of the culture committee. She said she and Collins made an effort to ensure there was no age-based hierarchy on the team. The duo tries to schedule social events where players can experience Los Angeles together. From ice cream outings to beach days, Collins and Plumptre work hard so that teammates know each other as people rather than just as players. 
“[Collins is] easy to talk to, very welcoming, great energy, super friendly… so it lends itself well for those younger players and new players coming into the team to have an upperclassman, in particular one who has excelled and done so well on the field, to have that person be the one to welcome you and give you that much attention. It puts them at ease and helps them start off the right way.” 
However, with Collins, it’s only so long before things get goofy. Plumptre remembers when she, Collins, Petredes and redshirt junior forward/defender Samantha Bruder drove to a random parking lot to shoot impromptu music videos last semester. 
“We would play this song and everyone had their own move, so we made a dance video with the car in the background,” Plumptre said. “And we would be on the car. It was like our prop, and we’d make different music videos.” 
McAlpine could hardly think of specific memories because Collins has always brought the same playful exuberance from the moment she arrived at USC. 
“It’s hard to encapsulate in words. You walk in and she’s just like a firecracker,” he said. “On game day she’s bouncing around, dancing, really energetic, and I think that’s contagious. Any time you get that type of energy from one of your leaders it’s hard to feel down.” 
It’s not all laughs and jokes with Collins, though. Her mix of talent and dedication has made her one of the more decorated goalkeepers in the nation even with two remaining seasons of eligibility, but her drive to get better means she is more frustrated by the accolades than proud of them. 
“Last year I thought I could’ve been so much cleaner, and I take responsibility for that,” she said. “I think coming up this year I’m ready to prove to myself that I do deserve those awards at some point. I feel ready.” 
Collins cited her redshirt season as a crucial step in her development. She had the chance to learn under senior goalkeeper and future professional Sammy Jo Prudhomme in a season in which Prudhomme was named 2016 Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Year. Most importantly, the Trojans won the national championship that season, an invaluable experience for Collins. 
“It’s good to keep having that model I can look back to and mirror,” Collins said of Prudhomme. “That redshirt year was everything for me, and I’m so glad that I get to stay another two seasons because I don’t feel like I’ve reached [my peak] yet.” 
Though Collins may not be satisfied with her performance, McAlpine said he was proud of the work she has put in the last three years. The goalkeeper position is difficult, and McAlpine emphasized that it takes a lot of reps and film study to build the muscle memory and understanding of the position necessary to succeed at the college level. 
“We were just talking to her the other day about how sharp she looks, how you can tell it’s making sense mentally,” he said. “The game has slowed down for her so she’s in the right places, her communication is better. She’s way more dialed in and explosive.” 
Although Collins is obviously a vocal presence on the team, Plumptre said her goalkeeper consistently leads by example, turning her position into a lifestyle. 
“She has to communicate well as a goalkeeper, but she looks after herself well off the field. She’s always the one in the training room, she’s always doing extra recovery,” Plumptre said. “She’s super healthy, eats right and is always checking in with our nutritionist.” 
Collins is going above and beyond; she has become a proponent of the mindfulness movement in her pregame routine. It’s important for her to visualize positive results so she can not only improve but also stay calm through mistakes and move onto the next play. She credits the new approach as a reason for her continued success. Collins remembers sitting out with an ankle injury in the past and watching her fellow goalkeepers’ reps. Evaluating the position from afar was just as impactful as her participation in drills. 
“I’m at the point right now where I feel like I can get to a game, sit on the sidelines, go through the warmup in my head and feel ready to go,” she said. “That’s what I want to be able to do, is have that much power of doing it in my own head and being a controller of my thoughts … For a goalkeeper, it’s so important.” 
Collins’ experiences on and off the field have always been defined by confidence: the confidence to be outgoing, the confidence that unlocks her top performance in goal. Her confidence is at an all-time high, and, heading into a season where the Trojans have national title hopes, that’s exactly where it needs to be.

“Being educated is fly.” That’s what Saweetie, a 2016 alumna and rising rap goddess, told the Daily Trojan just days before she embarked on the latest — and arguably biggest — tour of her burgeoning career. With two released EPs, Saweetie has had a highly successful summer traveling the United States with Cardi B, whose rise to rap stardom just a couple years ago was similarly explosive.
 But talking to Saweetie, you wouldn’t know that the past few months for her have been filled with endless accolades. She speaks with striking passion and unexpected humility. You would never guess that her viral sensation “My Type” made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 
And while it’s obvious that she is busy (she’s a few minutes late to the interview) she says, “I just want to give you my undivided attention.” And she does exactly that.
 Talking to the Daily Trojan for the first time, the rapper opens up about her time at USC, her musical influences and how her career has skyrocketed since she last walked down Trousdale Parkway as a student.
Saweetie — born Diamonté Harper — grew up with a Filipina-Chinese mother and Black father in the Bay Area. She remembers spending her childhood playing with neighboring kids at the large apartment complex her family lived in. 
“The streetlights were my curfew,” she says, giggling over her memories of Hayward, Calif. 
As soon as those lights sparkled, she knew it was time to head home, where she often watched videos of some of the most influential Black female artists of the ’90s — specifically Ashanti and Aaliyah — who opened the door for artists like her. 
Unlike her idol Ashanti, who opted to pursue her career over attending Hampton University, Saweetie enrolled in San Diego State University and later USC while remaining fully devoted to her music. 
But finishing that journey through higher education wasn’t always in her plans. When asked if leaving college with a degree was always her intention, she responds resoundingly and without hesitation: “No.”
 As an Aztec, she contemplated dropping out and moving to Los Angeles to fully commit herself to a musical career in the ideal city to do so.
“But I promised myself if I got into USC, it was a sign I needed to finish college,” she recalls. 
She applied to USC as a communication major and waited for an acceptance letter to show up at her doorstep. After weeks of anxious waiting, it finally arrived. 
“Someone really close to me told me I would never get into my dream school,” Saweetie captioned a photo of her acceptance letter in 2013. “Remember, actions speak louder than words, and I will always continue to prove my doubters wrong.”
 Though she did prove her doubters wrong, there was one more obstacle she had to face to get exactly what she wanted. 
“I cried because they tried to put me in Dornsife,” she says of USC’s most-populated school. “And you know, Dornsife is like miscellaneous. That is not what I was trying to do.” 
So, she says with the cadence of a smile in her voice, she got “hella passionate” and fought her way into the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, as she originally intended. 
“I wrote a letter and told them why I deserved to be an Annenberg student,” she remembers. “They replied two days later and agreed to all of my points and granted me access to be a communication student.”
Saweetie got what she wanted and moved into the The Lorenzo Apartments near USC to kick off her sophomore year. And from the beginning, she stood out at USC. It was no different in professor Albert Napoli’s “Business for Non-Majors” class, which she took in Fall 2014. 
“I saw in her the drive and focus that entrepreneurs have,” he says. “She had this passion, this drive. I knew exactly what kind of direction she needed.”
 In their meetings after class, Saweetie told Napoli — whom she cites as an influential figure that encouraged her music career — about her aspirations as an entertainer.
Once, Napoli found Saweetie networking with corporate recruiters near Moreton Fig. He knew she didn’t belong there. “Her being there, getting in those lines to talk to those companies, it was the wrong thing,” he recalls. “She would have been miserable.” 
Napoli pulled her aside, and asked, “What are you doing here?” For Saweetie, that moment was a wakeup call. “He was like, ‘You and I both know that you want to do music, and none of these people here are in the direction you want to go,’” she remembers. “The fact that he said that, he believed in me more than I did.”
Saweetie shined brighter than her peers and rarely does Napoli see students with the tenacity and endless drive he saw in Saweetie. 
“I see a lot of dreamers and not a lot of doers. Diamonté is definitely a doer,” Napoli says, calling Saweetie by her birth name. 
“She’s a rare breed,” he adds. “She is the epitome of what you need to become a success.”
But while at USC, Saweetie was more than just an impressive student — she was already knee-deep in the hustle. She made t-shirts for “Money Makin’ Mamis,” a brand she founded and worked at a sports bar as well as at Marshall. 
On top of all that, Saweetie was working as a research assistant for professor Ann Majchrzak — who had absolutely no idea that one of her student workers had become one of the top-played rappers on the radio before the Daily Trojan reached out. 
Majchrzak says Saweetie put in “several hundred hours” over a few months coding for a research project exploring the emergence of crowdsourcing as a mechanism for innovation. 
“She was just tremendous,” Majcharzak says. “I couldn’t ask for anything better.”
The fruit of some of Saweetie’s “creative, focused, high-quality” research and coding is set to be published in Majchrzak’s forthcoming book, “Unleashing the Crowd.” 
But for Saweetie, juggling multiple jobs while attending school and building her rap career “sounds crazy, but when you’re actually doing it, it’s not that bad,” she says nonchalantly. 
“I’m very high maintenance,” she laughs. “I like to get my weave, my nails, I like going shopping. I had to keep myself up. And how do you do that? With four jobs.”
[My music] inspires people to boss up, to get they cost up and go out there and hustle.
With so much to do, it might seem like Saweetie wouldn’t have time to write music. But she found her muse in an unexpected place — her daily commute. 
After moving out of The Lorenzo (“They had us packed in there like some rats,” she says), she lived in the San Fernando Valley for her last two years of college. 
“Imagine that commute from Northridge to USC every day,” she says incredulously. But it was on those unimaginably long drives where Saweetie’s creativity flourished. 
“I would play a beat, and I would write in my notes as I was driving,” she says.

In May 2017, Saweetie released a homemade freestyle video of “ICY GRL” on Instagram, her unapologetic rap over the beat of Khia’s “My Neck, My Back.”
“There was a moment where I didn’t really have anything,” she said of writing the track to Billboard last year. “And the only option was for me to either mope, which I don’t like doing, or to be aspirational.” 
Her track went viral, and from there, the dominoes started to fall. She was signed to Warner Bros. Records. The “ICY GRL” music video has already garnered over 80 million views. Her debut EP “High Maintenance” came out in March 2018, and featured her breakthrough track and two songs with her boyfriend, rapper Quavo. 
And that rapid rise didn’t end in 2018 — it was just beginning. “ICY,” Saweetie’s second EP, came out in March 2019. 
Her new tracks seemed to precede the start of “hot girl summer,” a viral term coined by fellow female MC Megan Thee Stallion. 
“My Type,” the most-played song on “ICY,” perfectly embodies what it means to be a “hot girl.” It taps into the nostalgia of listeners by sampling Petey Pablo’s “Freek-A-Leek,” while rapping the unsubdued lyrics, “Bust down wrist, not a bust down bitch / Said I want your man, no the fuck I don’t sis.” 
It’s that “I don’t give a fuck” attitude, bold lyricism and raw talent that’s propelled women rappers like Saweetie to the top in today’s music era. Saweetie became the seventh female rapper in 2019 to make the Hot 100 charts, breaking the record for the number of female rappers on the chart in a year this decade. 
“I’m so happy that women, that we,” she corrects herself, “are being respected for our craft.” 
She also has a lot to live up to as a Bay Area rapper — but she’s sure making strides into the NorCal rap hall of fame that boasts platinum legends Mac Dre, Too $hort, E-40 and MC Hammer while featuring a smaller, contemporary group of popular MCs like G-Eazy, P-Lo, Iamsu! and Sage the Gemini. 
“I’m making my mark. I’m putting my work in,” she says. “I might not be a veteran in that group, but I feel like I’m making a name for myself.” 
While Saweetie says she’s finally found her sound, she doesn’t think it can be characterized. 
“I feel it’s not really like anybody else’s so it’s hard to put it into words,” she says. 
But if there’s one way she describes her music, it’s inspirational. 
“It inspires people to boss up to get they cost up and to go out there and hustle,” she says. “But beyond that, I’m also inspiring them to party and work that ass.”
While her career continues to explode, she still keeps USC close to her heart, referring to her Trojan roots in her music and keeping up with the scandals that seem to continuously plague USC, like the college admission bribery scheme that unraveled earlier this year. 
“I understand that parents go hard for their kids, but [as] someone who’s worked their ass off and didn’t have the resources like that, it’s kind of not fair,” she says. 
She’s even made appearances at the University since finding success. Last November, she met with students at a Black Student Assembly event, where she was happy to connect with Trojans of color who were once in her position as students with dreams. 
One of the students at the BSA meetup was Arrington Bridges, a senior majoring in political science, who grew up in Castro Valley — a town adjacent to Saweetie’s Hayward. He credits the rapper’s success to her unequivocal relatability. 
She’s a rare breed. She’s the epitome of what you need to become a success.
“It’s the street attitude, [yet] she went to college,” he says. “It just makes me feel like I’m at the right place in life. It can be disillusioning when you don’t see yourself represented on campus. Being an African American student at USC can be alienating, but Saweetie is a beacon of hope and a motivation for a lot of the African American students on campus.” 
And for Bridges — who’s dipping his own toes in the rap game under the name Bustdownarri — Saweetie’s visit proved the perfect opportunity for him to rap some bars for her. 
“I raised my hand and was like, ‘I’m from a city over, you gotta let me rap for you,’” he says. “So I started rapping on the spot.” 
And Saweetie? She was feeling it. 
“He was going off!” she exclaims. 
Bridges’ star moment even made its way onto Saweetie’s Instagram story — which boasts a casual 3 million followers. She hopes that aspiring musicians like Bustdownarri see her as proof that when it comes to school versus career, “you can do both.” 
“You don’t have to be a dropout,” she says. “You don’t have to disregard your education.” And it becomes obvious, after talking to Saweetie, that sticking to a plan and always getting what you want is part of that “ICY” mentality that she embodies. 
“It’s not always about being iced up or stuntin’ on hoes. Icy to me is hustling and having the mentality of getting what you said you was gon’ get,” she says. “Everything I was gon’ get, I got. It’s very important to believe in yourself — and that’s what an icy girl and an icy boy is.”

One of the first stories that I ever wrote for the Daily Trojan was an interview with Dr. Laura Mosqueda, who was then appointed interim dean of the Keck School of Medicine. Scandals had rocked Keck, as Mosqueda’s predecessors, Carmen Puliafito and Rohit Varma, and their alleged misconduct had put USC at the center of scrutiny. 
I remember taking the USC shuttle to the Health Sciences Campus, a mere freshman hardly able to navigate the main campus, much less the one on Los Angeles’ Eastside.
I think what stood out to me the most was being in Mosqueda’s office. I thought about all that must have happened in this very space, with Puliafito’s troubling entanglement with drug and prostitution circles. What was hidden in the walls of this room? 
At the time, the Keck School’s scandal reached headlines nationwide. Our newsroom staff had worked tirelessly covering the latest developments through summer and into the new academic year. 
But we had no idea that this was only the beginning.
What ensued in the following two years was a journalistic rampage. Former USC gynecologist George Tyndall came under fire as hundreds of students accused him of sexual misconduct. President C. L. Max Nikias stepped down after eight years. Six male graduates filed a lawsuit against former men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly, accusing him of sexual abuse. The college admissions scandal uncovered by the FBI contained cases overwhelmingly connected to USC. And these are just a few examples of the news stories the Daily Trojan has worked to cover over the past year and a half.
It is an understatement to say that our news team was inundated with work. 
Round-the-clock reporting never seemed like enough. The Spring 2019 semester was particularly grueling, with our news editors and managing team skipping classes and losing sleep to ensure that our stories were as accurate and timely as possible. Many of those in the USC community may not realize that there was — and has been — an unspoken competition between the Daily Trojan and other national publications covering USC. We hold ourselves to the standards of professional newspapers, covering our campus with the same diligence and breadth, without the resources of an established news organization. Our coverage of USC’s scandals leveled the playing field between us and other award-winning professional outlets. Breaking a story first, or having a source get back to us, is a race to the finish line, particularly in an increasingly digital era.
It is an important time for reflection for everyone — the student body, the Board of Trustees, administrators, faculty and staff. But we have only just realized that we have been so busy reporting, laying out pages and pumping out stories that we had almost forgotten that our newsroom needs to look internally and reflect, as well.
Mental health issues, specifically burnout from covering these intense stories, isn’t specific to the Daily Trojan. According to a 2018 European Journalism Centre News Impact Network study, 50% of journalists said they felt overwhelmed by their day-to-day jobs, while only 7% felt their work was manageable. Newsrooms need to begin taking significant action to promote the mental health of their journalists, especially in an era dominated by stories of trauma, from mass shootings to natural disasters. The Daily Trojan is no exception.
This semester, I will be leading the Daily Trojan’s Wellness Initiative as the newspaper’s wellness director, alongside associate managing editor Karan Nevatia. This summer, we sat down and deliberated what it means to have a healthier workspace. We decided that we cannot function as the publication we are striving to be if our reporters and staffers are not well-supported — emotionally, mentally and physically. 
As part of the initiative, we’re hosting wellness activities, monthly individual check-ins with our editors, and introducing channels for feedback to ensure our staff members are well-supported in their ability to manage their role at the newspaper while dealing with the stress of classes and their other jobs. Nipping deep sources of stress in the bud can be one of the solutions to a healthier and more productive newsroom.
We’re also renewing our commitment to covering student wellness and stories of mental health in-depth this semester. Just as we want to see the mental health of our staff improve, we also want to see the mental health of every student on campus improve — our coverage of on-campus mental health this semester will reflect that.
Our hope is that by making significant changes to our newsroom, we are not just improving the well-being of our staff but also benefiting the quality of our journalism. 
Take this note as a warm welcome into a new era of the Daily Trojan.

Los Angeles is a beautiful city. With its soft westerlies rolling off of the Pacific Ocean, the window lights that twinkle at night like stars in the skyscrapers of downtown L.A. and the pink sunset hues that caress the evening silhouettes of the palm trees, it’s easy to believe that Los Angeles is something of a perfect paradise. 
But the city is facing a crisis of complacency and apathy toward the environmental problems facing the planet today, and the City of Los Angeles has a responsibility to implement realistic and timely solutions to promote sustainability before it’s too late — it should look to USC’s Sustainability Plans to make such changes. 
Earlier this year, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti introduced the city’s 2019 Green New Deal, dubbed “pLAn.” Garcetti intends to reach lofty goals including creating 400,000 new “green” jobs by 2050, planting 90,000 by trees by 2021, diverting 100% of waste from landfills by 2050, electrifying 80% of transportation by 2030, gaining 100% renewable energy by 2045 and recycling 100% of wastewater by 2035. These goals seem great on paper and are met with applause by Los Angeles citizens.
However, they fall short of what L.A. needs: According to the 2018 United Nations Special Report on Global Warming, 2030 marks a point of no return for dealing with environmental issues before climate change’s catastrophic effects become irreversible. Yet most of Garcetti’s goals extend to deadlines in 2035 and beyond. Furthermore, by using deadlines that are over a decade away, Garcetti ensures that he will no longer be in office — and no longer responsible — by the time those dates approach. The rhetoric in Garcetti’s “pLAn” is great for applause and his future political hopes but is just that: rhetoric. 
In 2017, the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at UCLA issued an environmental report card for Los Angeles County. The major focal point of the issuance was to measure the county’s progress in environmental sustainability, while also being used as a tool to catalyze stimulating discussions and debates that could lead to a healthier environment. 
The report card is divided into categories such as renewable energy resources, stationary energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, transportation and air quality and human health impacts. In nearly every category, Los Angeles received a “C” grade. The highest mark on the ERC was a B, for the county’s renewable energy resources. 
The report found L.A. air remains among the worst not only in the state of California but also in the entire nation. High levels of pollutants are found in storm water, groundwater and almost all of the region’s bodies of water. L.A. County households spent 32% more energy than the average Californian household. Arguably most dire, about 20% of county residents live in areas ranked among the worst in California by state environmental screening scores, exposing them to high environmental health risks. 
With such environmental issues affecting Los Angeles so greatly, it’s clear that Garcetti’s plan isn’t doing enough. Tackling the effects of climate change and promoting sustainability in a city as large as Los Angeles is no easy task, but it’s the city’s responsibility to move quickly and make significant changes, so real effects take place before it’s too late. One way of addressing these issues might be to look to USC.
USC unveiled its Sustainability 2020 Plan in 2015. The plan is organized around seven core initiatives: education and research, engagement, energy conservation, transportation, procurement, waste diversion and water conservation. The Sustainability Steering Committee consists of faculty, staff and students that based the University’s environmental goals through realistic means and methods that are within the capabilities of USC. The University relied on peer institutions like Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Cornell University and Stanford to iron out its sustainability plan. 
More recently, USC unveiled an updated Sustainability 2028 Plan. While many of its goals are similar to the 2020 Plan, it includes a survey for University students that measures their sustainability needs and intends to reach out to the City of Los Angeles to share and determine sustainability innovations and best practices. Garcetti’s administration would do well to listen to the University’s Sustainability Steering Committee to inform its own plan and bolster its effectiveness. 
The environmental problems affecting Los Angeles and the world won’t be solved overnight or even within a year, but bold and effective solutions must be put in place before it’s too late.

The 2019 Trojans’ men’s basketball regular season does not begin until November, but the team is already gaining national attention thanks to a player who won’t even set foot on a college court this year. 
On Aug. 5, USC received a commitment from Evan Mobley, a 7-foot product of Temecula, Calif. and the No. 1 high school basketball prospect in the class of 2020. At USC, Mobley will join his father Eric, an assistant coach, and his brother Isaiah, a highly touted incoming freshman power forward. 
“It will be great to play with [Isaiah]; we have really good chemistry together,” Mobley told ESPN. “He has been a big influence on me both on and off the court.” 
Although he is just beginning his basketball career, Mobley has already accumulated an impressive collection of accolades. Along with winning the Gatorade Player of the Year Award for men’s high school basketball as a junior, Mobley helped the USA National Team win gold medals at the FIBA U17 World Cup in 2018 and the U19 World Cup earlier this summer. 
Mobley will be a huge addition to Andy Enfield’s Trojan squad, which has not made the NCAA tournament since 2017. USC posted a 16-17 record last year — the program’s worst season since 2015. 
But despite the underwhelming performance, and even without Mobley’s contributions, USC enters the 2019 season with a recruiting class ranked eighth in the nation by ESPN and a legitimate chance to build momentum after recent shortcomings. 
USC’s strong incoming freshman class, combined with Mobley’s arrival in 2020, has the Trojans poised to bring a winning product back to the Galen Center for the foreseeable future.
“Coach Enfield’s a great guy and a great coach,” Mobley said. “USC has a great freshman class coming in. It will be a young team this year, and I’m excited about the future.”
The Trojans’ 2019 recruiting class comprises the elder Mobley, guards Kyle Sturdivant and Ethan Anderson, forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Onyeka Okongwu, and two-sport standout guard Drake London, who doubles as a wide receiver on the football team. 
For the Trojans to have any chance at making a deep playoff run in March, they will have to rely on Isaiah Mobley to consistently perform at a high level. In his senior season at Rancho Christian High School, Mobley averaged 22 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and three blocks per game. The only player from California to play in the McDonald’s All-American Game, Mobley is a five-star recruit and the No. 4-ranked power forward in the class of 2019. 
Mobley and the Trojans began preparing for the upcoming season with a foreign tour in Europe from Aug. 6 to 16. USC traveled to Barcelona, Cannes and Paris for three nights, playing one game in each city. 
“Our student-athletes and staff will have an amazing opportunity to enjoy a unique educational and cultural experience,” Enfield said prior to the trip.
USC also announced July 31 that it has scheduled a home exhibition game Oct. 18 against the 2018 national champion Villanova Wildcats. All proceeds from the game will go to the California Fire Foundation, which provides emotional and financial support to the families of fallen firefighters in the recent California wildfires. 
The Trojans will tip off the regular season against Florida A&M Nov. 5 at Galen Center. The official Pac-12 schedule has yet to be announced, but conference play will not begin until after the new year. 
If all goes right for USC in 2019, last season’s subpar performance will quickly be put in the rearview mirror. The program’s recent additions should have Trojan fans excited for exactly that.

Lambda Chi Alpha purchased its fraternity house from USC in late June following a four-year fundraising endeavor that began in 2015 when the University approached the organization encouraging it to purchase the estate.
“USC is trying to divest the real estate holdings that they have on The Row, specifically fraternity houses that [were previously] owned by the school for many years,” Interfraternity Council President Matteo Mendoza said. 
Mendoza, a junior majoring in business administration, also said there are differences in risk management between the University and the fraternity’s national organization regarding security and event hosting. 
“With the types of events thrown at fraternity and sorority houses there is an element of risk that national organizations are used to dealing with and that are better equipped at dealing with,” Mendoza said.
According to the University, the house, located on Greek Row, has been part of USC Greek life for more than 50 years. USC purchased the house from ETA Delta House Corporation in 1963. In 2019, the University officially sold the house to Lambda Chi Alpha USC Property Holdings. 
Lambda Chi Alpha Chapter President Ryan Doyle said the University proposed a four-year timeframe for them to purchase the house. However, the fraternity faced financial obstacles limited by this time constraint, including fundraising enough money.
Doyle said Lambda Chi was worried the organization would lose the house if it did not raise enough funds in four years.
“If we didn’t raise the capital to close on the financing portion of the purchase, I assume they would have just sold it to the next person in line,” said Doyle, a junior majoring in business administration.
Four alumni of the fraternity spearheaded the fundraising campaign in 2015, Doyle said. Throughout the past four years, Lambda Chi has seen four presidents and four executive board offices cycle through the fundraising process. 
Doyle said the alumni commitment and support throughout the campaign reflected a unified drive to ensure the future success of the fraternity and to preserve the experiences of alumni for future members.
“It’s really interesting to see that alumni, 40 years in the future, still care about the organization just as much as they did during their undergraduate experience,” Doyle said. “[The alumni] aren’t donating for any other reason other than they just had a beneficial experience [in the past] and they want to continue that for future students.” 
In June, the fraternity was still $130,000 away from the total amount of money stated at the beginning of the four-year campaign needed to legally commit to purchasing the property.
The organization had 12 days before escrow, Doyle said. He also acknowledged the improbability of raising nearly $130,000 in less than two weeks. He said the hardest part of the fundraiser was convincing supporters that the money would be raised. 
However, the fundraiser saw other members of the Greek community along with parents and alumni donate to the cause. The fraternity’s GoFundMe page garnered nearly $83,000 of the required $130,000 before the escrow deadline, the rest of the funds came in by check and private wire donations.
“The chapter house is paramount to the organization’s success, longevity and the USC Lambda Chi experience that either you or your son is familiar with,” Doyle wrote on the page.
The inundation of support secured the house in Lambda Chi’s name on the 12th day, beating the escrow deadline and raising a grand total of an estimated $140,000.
“I’m just very proud of all of the guys for putting in the effort that they did. 130 guys, 110% for 12 days. And it truly was every single person that made it happen,” Doyle said. “And I’m very proud of each and every single one of them for doing what they did.”

With the 2019 season just around the corner, USC women’s soccer is set to build upon last year’s success with a team that has all the tools to bounce back and take another stab at the national championship.  
The Trojans are fresh off another impressive season under head coach Keidane McAlpine, who has led the team to four straight campaigns with at least 15 wins. However, the team’s search for its second title in three years ended with a heartbreaking loss to Florida State in the Sweet Sixteen  of the NCAA tournament on penalty kicks.    
The team will enter the season ranked No. 5 in the United Soccer Coaches Preseason Poll behind two Pac-12 schools: Stanford and UCLA.
USC lost three seniors and two graduate students during the offseason, but is expecting returning players to fill the void, including sophomore forward Penelope Hocking and redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins. Hocking earned Pac-12 Freshman of the Year for her stellar 14-goal campaign, which included three game-winners.
Collins was a second team All-American after an outstanding season in which she allowed just 11 goals en route to 10 shutouts. She will look to maintain a solid defensive unit and improve on her already-impressive 86.1% save percentage.  
Collins’ defensive line will be anchored by senior outside back Julia Bingham, who has started all but four games during her college career thus far. Bingham has been one of USC’s most reliable defenders to date and earned All-Pac-12 second team honors last season.
The Trojans will face a tall task in replacing injured junior midfielder Savannah DeMelo. A third team All-American last season, DeMelo was recently named to the Hermann Trophy watch list, alongside Collins. DeMelo posted nine goals and 10 assists in 21 games in 2018 but will miss the majority of the season due to an Achilles injury. 
DeMelo’s absence will place a heavy offensive burden on returning midfielders senior Jalen Woodward and junior Alea Hyatt.  
“She is a really big part of our team,” said Bingham, who has competed against DeMelo from a young age. “But I believe we do have a lot of [midfielders] that could fill her spot. I have no doubt we will be fine.”
McAlpine said he will give junior midfielder Arlie Jones the nod in DeMelo’s place.
“We expect [Jones] to do some big things,” McAlpine said. “She is a very talented player that has not really gotten [an] opportunity show her skill, but I think people will be surprised.”
USC’s strong incoming freshman class will help lessen the impact of DeMelo’s absence. The Trojans have once again compiled one of the best recruiting classes in the nation, coming in at No. 3 overall behind UCLA and Penn State.
The talented class of 2023 includes midfielder Croix Bethune, who was named the country’s top midfielder in 2017. Another newcomer, forward Olufolasade Adamolekun, recently played for the Jamaican national team in the FIFA Women’s World Cup and will provide useful international experience to the team.
The Trojans were also able to land graduate transfer Natalie Ward from Notre Dame, where she appeared in 34 games. Although her senior season was cut short due to injury, Ward’s experience will be a valuable asset.
USC will field one of the most formidable and complete teams in the nation, but winning the Pac-12 will be no easy task. Reigning Pac-12 champion Stanford is a perennial powerhouse that will look to defend its conference title for the fifth season in a row. The Cardinal also boast a solid lineup featuring two Hermann watch list candidates: sophomore forward Sophia Smith and junior forward Catarina Macario.  
UCLA is coming off an Elite Eight appearance and will return a top-tier offense that threatens to knock off the Trojans for the third year in a row. The Bruins brought in All-American transfer Lucy Parker from LSU this offseason to lead their defense, posing a challenge for a USC team without DeMelo. 
“Beating every California team will be huge because we always struggle with California schools,” Bingham said. “We really have to stay focused and locked in for every game.”
On top of an extremely competitive Pac-12 schedule, USC is slated to play some of the most difficult non-conference opponents in the nation, including reigning national champion Florida State. The Trojans will look to avenge last year’s season-ending loss to the Seminoles in the rematch Sept. 1.
“One of the things that I like about this group is that we have a lot of experience and older players who have been a part of [the] 2016 championship team, and we also have players who played in that very tough loss against FSU,” McAlpine said. “We can use that experience and the disappointment of not reaching our goals last season to our advantage.”
A well-rounded recruiting class and a more experienced lineup should also help the Trojans down the stretch during conference play and in closely contested matches. For USC to capture the top spot in the Pac-12, it will need to prove that it can compete with the top teams in the conference — and there will be limited room for error.

Anyone doubting if musical theater is alive and well at USC need look no further than Musical Theatre Repertory, an entirely student-run theater company started in 2005 by alumni Lili Fuller and Steve Edlund. Every production is directed, produced, choreographed and performed by students. Since the organization’s beginnings, MTR has put on at least two performances every school year. Last year, the Repertory tackled two challenging productions: “Avenue Q” and “Spring Awakening”.
While many students from the School of Dramatic Arts are part of MTR, the club is not directly affiliated with it. It’s made up of students from all USC schools; whether they study at Roski School of Art and Design or Viterbi School of Engineering, one thing connects all the students involved — an unbridled passion for musical theater. 
Show director and club president Tyler Ellis, an SDA senior, has been part of MTR since his freshman year and credits the club with making his college career as special as it was. 
“[MTR] is such a good way to throw yourself into something,” Ellis said. “You have the common goal to make a really good show and it’s with people that have a passion and want to devote their time to making something bigger than themselves.”
Students interested in being a part of MTR can get started right when school begins. Auditions for the first show of the semester (“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee”) take place after Labor Day. The cast will rehearse for three weeks before performing from Sept. 27 to 29 at the Massman Theatre. 
“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” is a crowd-pleaser featuring one continuous act and nine actors. The musical’s format fits perfectly with MTR’s relatively short three-week rehearsal period. According to Ellis, the show is quite “hilarious and heart-warming” and is the first time in MTR’s 15-year history that it is repeating a show. Nevertheless, the rehearsal schedule is intense, with multiple hours of practice, six days a week. But beyond committed performers, MTR welcomes those interested in working behind the scenes. 
“We’ll put you on crew, have you help with costumes backstage, do a soundboard or lighting operation or help pass out programs,” Ellis said. 
Later on in the year, students can apply to MTR’s board to help with the administrative aspects of production or even choreography and direction.
In October, MTR will hold auditions for its next show, “Dogfight”. A cult classic musical, “Dogfight” follows a group of teenage boys on the night before they leave for the Vietnam War. Created by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul — the songwriting team behind “Dear Evan Hansen” and “A Christmas Story” — the musical ran off-Broadway in 2012.  
“It’s insane,” Ellis said. “It explores war, love, brotherhood — it’s going to be fantastic.” 
Ellis himself will produce the show with director Austin Karkowsky and music director Katie Kivinski, both USC juniors.
Beyond musicals, Ellis said MTR is excited about the University’s recent strides to create more space and recognition for the arts. President Carol Folt is holding a showcase for the arts in Bovard Auditorium Sept. 18 where student groups will perform. Ellis said MTR is looking forward to being a part of this new chapter in the life of the University. 
“USC does not sleep on artists at all, and some very successful ones have come out of this school,” Ellis said. 
With “Spelling Bee,” “Dogfight” and one more musical in the spring, MTR is gearing up for another exciting season representing the University’s performing arts in its own unique way.

The Los Angeles Times published an editorial Aug. 7 penned by student government leaders at several universities involved in the Operation Varsity Blues admissions scandal uncovered in March.
USC Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone co-authored the piece, which focused on the inequalities within the college admissions process.
The op-ed, titled “Operation Varsity Blues doesn’t end unfair college admissions policies,” was co-authored by Stone; Robert Blake Watson, president of UCLA’s Undergraduate Students Association Council; Erica Scott, president of Stanford University’s Associated Students of Stanford; and Kahlil Greene, president of Yale University’s Yale College Council.
“There is discussion on all of our campuses about the deeper issues, more than just the celebrities that were involved,” Stone told the Daily Trojan. “But, I think [the op-ed was] about bringing a student perspective to a larger national issue.”
The letter came five months after the release of an FBI investigation that found that 33 wealthy parents used a back-door admissions scheme that included bribes and fake athletic profiles to secure their children’s spots at universities like USC, UCLA, Yale and Stanford. 
Student leaders from the four schools wrote about economic inequalities within the college admissions process, such as access to preparatory classes for standardized tests and traveling for campus visits. They encouraged college administrators to address these issues alongside the problems on each campus that allowed the bribery scheme to go on.
“The conspiracy received global attention — particularly because of the celebrities involved — and prompted widespread disdain … as some internal campus investigations come to a close and guilty pleas pile up, it’s easy to think that the legal process has addressed the problem. Wrong,” the op-ed read. 
Stone suggested penning the letter after giving Watson a tour of the USC campus. The two student body presidents then reached out to Yale and Stanford’s student body presidents to collaborate. 
While colleges responded to the scandal, Watson said he and the other student leaders wanted to create a conversation on the role wealth plays in the college admissions process. 
On top of having at least two students admitted through the scheme, UCLA also made national headlines when an L.A. Times investigation found the school broke University of California rules by allowing a student athlete in 2014 to be admitted as a track athlete in exchange for a $100,000 donation. While the university investigated the situation and said it punished the coaches involved, the report did not lead to a systematic change in athletic admissions, according to the Times. 
At UCLA, Watson said he has worked on various projects to help all students perform well, including distributing free blue books and scantrons to all students. He has spoken with some administrative officials since the scandal broke in March to discuss how income inequality affects students both in the admissions process and throughout their time on campus. 
He said he looks forward to working with Stone and other student government leaders throughout the year to share ideas and initiatives. One of the formal meetings is a shared governance symposium between student government leaders at universities in Southern California, which UCLA will host this fall. 
“We’ve really had a lot of great, collaborative discussions surrounding what we’re doing at our campuses because our campuses are more similar than not in a lot of ways,” Watson said. “I think we’ve learned quite a bit from each other just in terms of how we’re handling these discussions, how we’re handling these practices at both of our schools.” 
Stone said he hopes for more collaboration between the USC student body and University administration to begin addressing wealth inequality in the admissions process and at USC. 
“We have had some response from our own administration and it’s definitely been brought up in a couple of my meetings and emails,” he said. “But the main purpose was to create a larger national discussion about the issue from a student perspective.”

I’m going to be upfront — I am not a sommelier. Despite my lack of formal education in the field, I do know I enjoy wine and have spent countless hours drinking it. 
This column is meant to be a petite, tongue-in-cheek introduction to the world of wine, not a comprehensive one by any means. Wine has come to occupy a special place in my life and I hope that it will soon occupy a similar place for this column’s readers.
Arriving at USC after the summer can mean different things to different people. For some, it’s the start of the final year of college and the anxiety of postgrad careers has pushed them to their breaking point. For others, it’s a brand new start — a time to reinvent themselves after being away for a few months. Or perhaps, others aren’t ready to let go of summer and are in denial. Whatever the mood may be, there’s a wine for everyone.
“Catching feelings for my summer fling” mood
Whether it was yesterday or a month ago, breaking it off with a summer fling can be tough. But if I’m being honest (and honesty is a key step to recovery), summer flings should stay in summer. So let’s focus on the now and find love again. 
And may André Brut California champagne be one of those many loves. Revered for its delicate, but consistent bubbles and elegance, this champagne is never a wrong choice. This blend of white wine grapes with a Malibu oceanside aroma will be the perfect accompaniment for new beginnings. 
Cost: $5
“#HotGirlSummer continued” mood
Who wouldn’t want the summer’s hottest mantra to last through the whole school year? I try to live my life unapologetically while hyping my friends up to live their best lives, and a glass of Fleur de Mer Rosé complements that attitude perfectly. 
Rich with a scent of watermelons and a subtle touch of citrus, Fleur de Mer Rosé comes from the region of Provence in France. This fruity rosé with a tropical aroma is perfect for that weekly brunch date with a group of girlfriends (or boyfriends)!
Cost: $16
“Um, I’m a senior already” mood
As a senior, I’m confronting the reality that my time at USC is beginning to end. It seems like only a few tailgates ago that I was the new kid on the block, ready to experience all that USC had to offer. Now I’m here — the start of the end. No one can blame seniors for wanting to reminisce about these past few years, but their minds will certainly blame them if they don’t do it with a glass of red wine (scientifically speaking). Give the 2011 Fergalicious a try. With a woody, Cuban cigar aroma, it stays in one’s memory for many years in the future, after just a few sips. And yes, it is from Fergie’s winery, and it is way better than her 2018 NBA All-Stars national anthem performance.
Cost: $20
Objectively speaking, wine is very subjective. If you’re in the mood for adventure, give these wines a try, you might come to the same conclusion or you might not. Either way, it’s totally okay. What matters most is to enjoy your experience and to welcome the new school year with a glass of wine.

BuzzFeed News published a thorough investigation earlier this month into 48 individual accounts of sexual assault perpetrated by a USC men’s health doctor. The rigorous report follows two years of high-profile scandals at the University, notably including its complicity in admission bribery schemes and inaction toward complaints of sexual assault committed by a former campus gynecologist, a scandal that arose in May 2018. 
The University must learn from these moral failings, and its students should be no exception. Despite providing top-notch courses from renowned faculty, the University does not require ethics education. If USC wants to create considerate future leaders and professionals who have the capacity to avoid the mistakes of current University officials, it must prioritize ethics education across all schools.
In 1993, USC adopted a mission statement promoting “the integration of liberal and professional learning” as “one of USC’s special strengths,” accomplished by a “love of truth” and “moral discernment.” Somewhere buried in the meaning of this prose, but stated nowhere, is the nebulous definition of ethics: using one’s position as an agent to make thoughtful choices. This loose framework is familiar to most, but becomes lost over time as students focus on graded content.
And despite the statement’s ambition, USC has no general education requirement for the study of ethics. Three of the 10 university-wide GE categories mention ethics as an aspect of the requirement, but instead place a greater focus on other (albeit important) themes. 
The same goes for individual department requirements, namely from the Marshall School of Business and the Viterbi School of Engineering, which feature no ethics requirements for students. Alternatively, students are more likely to encounter ethics discussions through their required writing courses. 
Recent WRIT 340 syllabi for students from Marshall and Viterbi include assignments like an ethics paper, giving students the chance to investigate salient questions in their profession beyond bare business. 
Still, in the midst of ethics crises at the University, the highest forms of government and abroad, writing one paper about ethics is likely insufficient in preparing students to grapple with increasingly tumultuous issues.
Despite the trend of college education placing a greater value on job training than critical reasoning in recent years, some of USC’s peer institutions mandate courses in ethics. Stanford University, for example, requires an Ethical Reasoning class in its core curriculum, ensuring students engage in ethics issues inside and outside of their major. 
Students have shown that this curriculum is in demand through popular clubs on campus that deal with ethics and morality. 
Los Angeles Community Impact and 180 Degrees Consulting, for example, apply useful business and consulting skills to improve the operation of nonprofits and social enterprises in USC’s backyard, enabling students to see and feel the change they can instill. 
In Viterbi, 3D Printing 4 Everyone and Code the Change are clubs that gear their work toward social impact, the former operating a project called Project Freehand which 3D prints prosthetic limbs for children in need of them.
These issues are highly applicable in the real world — in April, thousands of Google employees protested the company’s deal with the Pentagon to use their artificial intelligence software to improve military drone strikes. A strong sense of ethics empowers professionals to understand that, just as decisions by university executives can irreparably harm those they represent, a group of software engineers can successfully discourage company executives from a multi-billion dollar contract. These issues, and those who feel emboldened enough to tackle them, are far from abstract. 
As USC looks to build a brighter future at the onset of President Carol Folt’s tenure, it must continue to aspire toward “the full integration of liberal and professional learning,” pivoting toward long-term, structural changes to create considerate leaders for tomorrow. 
Empowering students to make decisions responsibly and deliberately through ethics education is a necessary next step if the University wants to make an example of — and, if it’s lucky enough, rectify — its present situation.

As USC enters a new chapter with President Carol Folt at the helm, she has the unique opportunity to use her experience as the chancellor of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill to effect change at the University. 
One of Dr. Folt’s final acts at UNC was to remove the pedestal of a Confederate statue known as “Silent Sam” from its location on UNC’s campus. 
USC has faced a similar issue with the Von KleinSmid Center — named after Rufus Von KleinSmid, a former president of the University who was a known racist and eugenicist. While USC created a task force on nomenclature to consider guidelines for renaming campus structures, little has been done to make significant changes. Folt should make it one of her first actions as president to rename VKC and start addressing other statues and structure names that no longer align with the University’s values, like Traveler, USC’s mascot white horse that may have been named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s horse, Traveller.  
Von KleinSmid was the University’s fifth president,but he also  founded a eugenicist organization in Pasadena and wrote a paper advocating for the forced sterilization of people of color. 
It’s clear that Von KleinSmid’s actions and views have no place in today’s society, and therefore his name should have no place on USC’s campus. 
When Folt removed Silent Sam’s pedestal from UNC, the Los Angeles Times reported that, initially, Folt advocated for the statue to become part of a “truly strong interactive [learning] center that tells our full history of this university.” 
While moving the statue from a place of glorification to a learning space where people could truly understand the history behind the statue could have been a conciliatory move, Folt quickly realized that it was better for UNC’s community to remove the monument entirely. 
The decision drew criticism from conservative members of the UNC community — in fact, it resulted in UNC’s board of governors removing Folt from her position as chancellor months before she had planned on leaving. 
Folt understood that she would risk her job by removing Silent Sam, yet she still chose to take the strongest possible action. As USC’s president, she should act with similar strength in renaming VKC. 
President Folt has come to a university rocked by scandals. Students have lost trust in the University administration, and it’s Folt’s duty to regain that trust by responding to students’ demands and needs. 
Students have advocated for the University to reconsider VKC’s name for years, yet the school has taken little action. 
Folt’s experience with Silent Sam proves that she is willing to take substantial steps to changing campus structures — by changing VKC’s name, she can show USC students that she is committed to righting wrongs from USC’s history.

Walking into the USC Bookstore, visitors are typically met with a sea of cardinal and gold Trojan apparel from big-name brands like Nike and Heritage Apparel. Now, a new display featuring playful apparel and creative stationery designed by recent USC graduate Macki Alvarez-Mena is taking center stage at the store. 
During her time at USC, Alvarez-Mena, a graduate of the Iovine and Young Academy, was approached by fellow Kappa Kappa Gamma member Jenny Nelson after Alvarez-Mena created a line of apparel for the sorority. Her sorority sister, who worked at the bookstore, suggested Alvarez-Mena design clothing for the  bookstore. 
A year later, that suggestion became a reality.  Alvarez-Mena is the first student to have her own clothing and stationery line in the USC Bookstore. The collection will be available at the store and online until Aug. 25.
Alvarez-Mena wants her line to make new and returning students feel the excitement of coming to USC’s campus for the first time whenever they wear and see her clothing designs.
“It was really special to share that [feeling] with everyone who I went to school with, and that for them to understand it, for them to get it,” Alvarez-Mena said. “To be able to give back to [a] school that we love so much and share it with my friends and family is the biggest thing for me.”
Darren James, the director of retail for USC Auxiliary Services, helped Alvarez-Mena throughout the process. From buying the products her designs would be printed on to working on the bookstore’s marketing campaign for the line, James wanted to involve Alavarez-Mena in the process in any way he could.
James said he noticed Alvarez-Mena’s work after seeing social media filters she had created while working as a graphic design intern for USC Athletics. 
“The brand has a very specific feel to it, a very traditional feel to it,” James said. “[It] is very unusual to come across artwork that really looks at the brand from a different perspective, and you can see that through the social media filters that she created.”
James hopes more USC students will continue to add creativity to the USC brand — he said the bookstore hopes to begin hosting “Pitch Day” events to give students from across campus the chance to pitch product ideas for the bookstore and receive feedback.
For over a decade, Alvarez-Mena has known that she wanted to work in creative industries, such as design and business. When she was 12 years old, the IYA graduate started a children’s brand in her hometown of Miami, where she sold hand-painted canvas bags with original designs.
Alvarez-Mena put this endeavor, called Macki and Company, on hold during high school but always knew she wanted to return to designing clothing. Being a student in IYA provided her with the resources and time to fully dedicate herself to her company.
“That was the whole point of me going to the Academy … to gain it all, the knowledge and the resources that I didn’t have as a 12-year-old in order to make it a legitimate business,” Alvarez-Mena said.
Alvarez-Mena cites her time at the Iovine and Young Academy as being instrumental not only in the creation of her clothing line, but also in her post-graduation plans with Macki and Company. 
“They gave me so much and not in the sense of direct resources,” Alarvarez-Mena said. “Just everything we learned — the passion or mentality, the diligence to get up and do some things and make something out of it was incredible.”
One resource at USC for Alvarez-Mena was Elissa Grossman, a professor of clinical entrepreneurship and the director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, who first met Alvarez-Mena in a freshman innovation class.
“I’m just thrilled that everyone at USC is beginning to get a glimpse of what Macki is able to accomplish,” Grossman wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
Currently, Alvarez-Mena is in the entrepreneurial stage of Macki and Company and continues to market her clothing to 7 to 12-year-old girls. The goal of Alvarez-Mena’s company remains the same as it was over a decade ago: She wants to provide young girls with the products and resources that she didn’t have when she was their age. 
“She cares deeply about the world and is tremendously innovative about how she wants to effect positive change,” Grossman wrote.
This article has been updated to reflect the proper name of Macki Alvarez-Mena. A previous version referred to her as Macki Alvarez-Nena.

The Daily Trojan spoke with Visions and Voices: The Arts and Humanities Initiative Executive Director Daria Yudacufski on what goes into planning each year’s calendar, and how certain artists are chosen. On Aug. 22, Bovard Auditorium will host the 14th annual Visions and Voices inaugural event, SPARK!, which will kick off the Arts and Humanities initiative’s 2019-20 season. 
According to Yudacufski, most Visions and Voices events come to USC through a competitive grant process, after which a board of over 30 representatives selects events and performers nearly two years in advance. Yudacufski has organized the program since its founding in 2006. While the Arts and Humanities Initiative has since grown, Yudacufski said that her team has always focused on events that will kindle connections between people with diverse ideas. She believes the arts offer a unique opportunity to talk about tough issues in a way that is  enjoyable, emotional and effective.
Yudacufski said the entire program began as a way for students to interact directly with composers, choreographers and other professionals in a variety of genres. For her, transforming performances from a passive to active experiences is part of what sets Visions and Voices apart from similar programs. Visions and Voices events usually include time at the end of the show for audience members to ask performers questions about their background and involvement in the arts.
“Looking at the brochures from over the years, I could see how much the initiative has grown,” Yudacufski said. “We now have a better understanding of what programming works best, how to publicize it, as well as how to get involved with the program. So the involvement amongst faculty and departments from throughout USC has grown and we are presenting a stronger series of programming as a whole.”
In the past, SPARK! has served as a variety show to introduce students, faculty and visitors to a myriad of creative genres, giving them a taste of the season to come. But, since 2018, Visions and Voices has taken a new approach to its inaugural event. This year, the USC community can expect to see the Los Angeles based Versa-Style Dance Company perform a full-length show, “Box of Hope.” 
Yudacufski said she is excited to see upcoming performances by Ali Stroker, the first actress using a wheelchair to hold multiple lead roles on Broadway and win a Tony Award, and Neil Ieremia, a New Zealand choreographer. 
Yudacufski said she expects to expand the new Visions and Voices initiative called Arts in Action, where students partner with community groups and bring art — and subsequent social activism — to the streets of South Los Angeles. Last year, under the direction of UC Santa Barbara professor William Warrener, Thornton School of Music students collaborated with members of the Urban Voices Project, a choir that provides Skid Row residents a place to harmonize and deal with the challenges of homelessness. 
“The program is still very new,” Yudacufski said, “But just from the few projects that have already taken place, there’s been a really powerful impact on the students and community members involved. The projects allow our students to expand their perspectives and awareness about a variety of issues while actively collaborating with often underserved communities.”
The new program also pioneered a series of theater demonstrations last year that took place in Los Angeles public transit. In “Jails and Justice: Rethinking Public Safety through the Arts,” performers boarded buses, waited for the vehicle to fill up and began a conversation about incarceration. After a while, bus passengers who did not know about the performance joined the conversation and expressed their views on the matter, and an unstaged discussion about the sensitive topic would ensue. 
“Experiences in the arts can be incredibly powerful,” Yudacufski said. “We live in a world where we’re becoming increasingly disconnected from each other and more connected to our devices. There’s increasing divisiveness, violence, anxiety and depression … In this world, the arts are more vital than ever.” 
This season, Visions and Voices plans to further such interactions between students and visitors, hoping to inspire and teach through every performance. 
“The arts inspire us, create a sense of connection and help us become more human,” Yudacufski said. “We want students to experience the arts in a way that is truly transformative and will encourage them to expand their perspectives, gain a better understanding of themselves and each other and make a positive difference in the world.”

Just as buzz about the college admission bribery scheme earlier this year was beginning to die down, a new instance of middle class families gaming the higher education system came to light in Illinois: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating a financial aid loophole in which parents allegedly disowned their kids to give them a better chance at receiving aid. 
At the core of this scandal, wealthier families are abusing financial aid funding and keeping low-income students from the funds they need to attend college or stay out of debt. 
Emerging last month from investigations into admissions at Midwestern universities, college counselor Lora Georgieva appears to be taking the full spotlight for helming this strategy. She discovered the lucrative business opportunity when noticing middle class families stressed over how to pay tuition for their kids. Georgieva was able to pinpoint a profitable, cost-effective loophole: Disown one’s child, appoint a family member or friend as a guardian in their junior or senior year of high school, establish them as an independent to remove large familial assets and reap the benefits of grant money and merit scholarships aimed at supporting low income students who don’t have enough money to afford college.
This financial aid ploy reflects another exploitation of the college admissions system that will continue to extend the gap between rich and poor. Students across the nation have struggled with rising tuition prices that unfairly harm low-income students who are already at a disadvantage when applying to and paying for college. Many students need financial support to be able to attend college, and some even forfeit going to college if they’re unable to pay. 
At USC, for example, nearly two-thirds of students receive some form of financial assistance. Many struggle to make ends meet and require large grants, scholarships, loans and work-study jobs to attend. 
This process, while selfish and cruel, is legal. Families just need to petition a probate judge to disown their kid, and, once accepted, they’re free to claim benefits meant for families making incomes equivalent to minimum wage. 
Still, this tactic is incredibly immoral. While they might intend only to benefit their own children, by doing this, families are harming students who have far greater financial concern going into college. Higher education is increasingly seen as a necessity for individuals in modern society, and this new financial aid loophole — along with the college admission bribery scandal — demonstrate that families have become willing to do anything to manipulate the education system.
The current heightened awareness of backdoors in college access and aid demands stricter guidelines to prevent families from manipulating the system. The ability to disown one’s child is simply too easy, and research shows that it’s entirely possible to pull off, no matter the person’s economic class. New language in the Federal Student Aid Handbook can nullify this strategy by stating that a student is still considered dependent if they have another legal guardian but still receive financial and medical support from their parents.
Even though stricter standards need to be employed, the entire issue reveals a dangerous undertone of the increasing barriers to entry for higher education due to high costs. 
Most Americans are finding it difficult to pay for rising tuition rates, and the upward trend is not stopping anytime soon — USC’s undergraduate tuition increased by 3.5% just this year. Both the college admissions scheme and the financial aid loophole are symptoms of a broken higher education system in the United States, but no family should be able to manipulate that system at the expense of those that are struggling.

Most traditional sports share the common objective of getting a ball to a specific area, whether it be a net, basket or end zone. Casual viewers can watch these sports and comprehend which team is doing better, even without knowing the underlying strategy. We also innately understand the abilities that humans have — they can run, jump, dive, etc.
Esports throws all of that out the window — we are now dealing with virtual characters with make-believe abilities in a virtual world. The possibilities are endless.
For first-time viewers, it’s hard to understand the objective of many esports titles. Pushing a payload, capturing a point or destroying a base is not an intrinsically obvious task. To non-esports fans, that last sentence was gibberish. That’s the problem.
I’m decently well-versed in esports, so when the Overwatch League began its inaugural season last year, I tuned in. I had played the game a few times and thought I understood it well enough to enjoy watching a professional match. Wrong. I was lost, without a clue as to what was happening. 
What is a payload? How do the players move it? What abilities does each hero have? These were just a few of the questions held by myself and other first-time Overwatch viewers following the league’s introduction.
A year later, Overwatch has become my most played game. I have spent hundreds of hours moving payloads, capturing objectives and controlling points. Now when I watch professional Overwatch, I understand the objective, strategy and abilities of each hero. 
For esports like Overwatch to be a part of the mainstream sports schedule, it can’t require hours of playtime for viewers to understand the basics. This issue is compounded by the fact that esports are broadcasted in a completely different manner from traditional sports.
Think of the last sport you watched. How was the game shot? What did the camera see? 
The answer is all of the action. Wide shots are used for every play in sports. This helps the viewer understand the arena — where players are in relation to each other, the basket, goal or sidelines. Close-up shots are reserved for replays or highlights.
Imagine trying to watch football from the perspective of the players. Prior to the snap you see what the center sees. After he snaps the ball, you watch from the eyes of the quarterback. He throws the ball and the camera goes to the wide shot. As the receiver is about to reel in the pass, you see his point of view. That’s basically how esports are broadcasted. It is incredibly disorienting and makes it difficult for viewers to understand what is happening. 
Watching a fast-paced title like Overwatch can be confusing. What the viewer sees on screen is constantly changing, jumping between different players’ point-of-view and third person map-wide shots. While it provides an added perspective for more experienced viewers, this shift makes it difficult for first-time viewers to grasp the context of the game.
How do we fix this issue? It’s not a simple solution.
Game developers, streaming services and tournament/league organizers have to make some serious changes. I am not calling for a complete overhaul of competitive video games. There is little room to manipulate the games themselves before they become too simplified for professional play. Rather, the focus should be placed on helping the viewer understand what is happening. 
Simple changes, like spending more time on wide shots or explaining the objective for the game mode about to be played, would give viewers a smoother transition into this new world of esports.
However, I will give the Overwatch League some credit. Of the esports I have watched, they have done by far the best job in simplifying the viewing experience. 
Before each round, the commentators explain the objective and offer commentary during the game to explain what is happening, how certain abilities work and what to look for. For the most part, they do a decent job of capturing the action from a third person view. And unlike many other esports, OWL has a season format with games every night Thursday-Sunday, so viewers always know when to tune in. 
If you are interested in understanding what esports are all about, I suggest you watch an Overwatch League match. You’re not going to understand everything within a couple minutes; it will take time to understand the intricacies of a professional esport, but I guarantee that after a couple games you’ll start to understand the general objectives. 
However, the burden should not fall on the viewers; they should not have to spend hours watching or studying a game just to understand the basic concept. It should ultimately be the responsibility of tournament and league organizers, game developers and streaming services to make the game comprehensible. 
For esports to be a part of the mainstream sports world any time soon, the industry needs to find a more effective way to broadcast matches to make games more accessible to new viewers. To the readers, I hope this column will give you a glimpse into the rapidly growing world of esports and encourage you to approach these sports with an open mind.

California is weighing legislation that would allow collegiate athletes to earn money through personal sponsorship deals, a policy currently prohibited by the National Collegiate Athletics Association. The California State Senate discussed SB 206, dubbed the “Fair Pay to Play Act,” and passed it by a margin of 31-5 on May 22. The second chamber of California’s legislative branch has yet to approve the bill but will discuss the proposition in mid-August, upon returning from its summer recess. If passed and signed by the governor, it would go into effect in January 2023. 
Despite the major strides the bill has made, several California universities — including USC — have come together to try and put a stop to the legislation. USC and Stanford University each released a statement expressing their opposition to the bill. The University of California and California State University systems also went on the record opposing SB 206. 
“We believe that any reforms must be addressed at the national level through the NCAA. Any reforms approved at the state level would place the schools in that state at a competitive disadvantage with other national programs,” USC said in a statement in June. “SB 206 would encourage students to violate the NCAA bylaws, becoming athletically ineligible and putting athletic teams and athletic departments at risk.”
The argument that the California bill conflicts with the NCAA’s national policy is ironic. California has passed criminal and state laws that conflict with United States federal law, so surely they can accept an athletic revenue policy that conflicts with a sports organization.  
And regardless, California has been a leader in challenging national policy. The state has been at the forefront of countless legal battles with other states and with federal policies. Virtually every time, California has come out the victor. For example, national automobile emissions policies were changed because California took leadership and adopted a stricter standard — one that went against the federal policy. 
USC also fears the NCAA will sanction its sports teams and make players ineligible for competition, resulting in revenue loss for the University. 
That said, it is understandable why the University is opposed to the measure: The NCAA is kicking USC around and has been the source of much of USC’s athletic anguish in recent years. 
Several past athletic scandals involving players accepting unauthorized gifts from professional agents resulted in some of the most severe NCAA sanctions in the organization’s history. The NCAA vacated the University’s football team’s final two wins of its 2004 national championship season and all wins in 2005. USC was banned from bowl games in both 2010 and 2011 and was docked a total of 30 scholarships over three years. Other sanctions include the basketball team having to give up all of its wins from the 2006-07 season and being banned from the playoffs in 2010. Trojan fans are still reminded of the 2018 basketball scandal, in which former assistant coach Tony Bland bribed players to commit to USC, that rocked the NCAA as well. Given the University’s history with NCAA, it makes sense that it would rather play it safe and get on the NCAA’s good side. 
For decades, the NCAA has taken advantage of the most talented crop of high school athletes in the country. Instead of allowing these athletes to sign professional contracts with major leagues, the NCAA brokered a deal requiring athletes to play collegiate-level sports before going pro. The reason is purely for to generate revenue — if the best athletes signed professional deals and skipped college sports, the collegiate season would be less competitive and entertaining to watch so fewer fans would tune in. 
But the NCAA takes it a step further: Not only does it require athletes to wait a few years before signing big-money professional contracts, but it also prohibits athletes from signing individual sponsorship deals that would allow them to make any money at all from their own likeness. The NCAA wants sponsors to work through its organization, so it can reap the rewards of these deals instead of the players themselves. 
The collegiate sports organization has, of course, publicly opposed SB 206 as well. It says it is completing a study about what private athletic endorsements would do to the league, but really, it’s just afraid of losing its monopoly on athletes. It doesn’t want its revenue to decline. USA Today even reported that the NCAA threatened the California legislature with banning schools from NCAA championships if SB 206 passed. 
Let’s see how excluding California schools will play out. This is a showdown the NCAA won’t want to pursue. 
If USC — or any California school — has any courage, it will allow its athletes to pursue their own, private business deals.

Not a lot of things in life are guaranteed, and for USC juniors and seniors, that list includes on-campus housing. 
USC only guarantees housing for underclassmen, leaving older students to fend for their own leases and rents without the experience or education they need to make informed decisions. USC should provide better housing education and resources for students living off campus — many of these students are leasing for the first time and can be taken advantage of by local landlords and housing companies.
Housing insecurity is a major problem for college students, and it can be hard for them to perform well academically when they are desperately searching for an affordable place to live, struggling to pay rent or have suboptimal living conditions due to landlord or property owner negligence. 
A 2015 report by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development found that colleges systematically underestimate students’ off-campus living costs. For example, the USC 2019-20 Cost of Attendance summary puts room and board at $15,916, which is just a bit higher than the average academic year cost of a one-bedroom apartment on-campus at USC Village and a residential meal plan. As a result of the expensive on-campus housing options, local landlords have also increased rents to be competitive with University-offered housing.
According to Rent Café, a nationwide rent listing service, the monthly average rent for an apartment in University Park is $3,809, over $1,000 more than the average apartment rent in Los Angeles, which is $2,508. Local landlords take advantage of the limited student housing and students’ resulting desperation to find a place by increasing rents.
Asking USC to lower on-campus rent prices is a fight unto its own, but at the very least, the University has an obligation to keep track of the housing offered around campus, ensuring that enough of it is available and affordable to students. 
USC can do this by better educating its students about the process of finding housing and keeping local landlords accountable, whether by tracking their rent prices in an online database or compiling and addressing student complaints about certain landlords and housing companies.
Local landlords also often fail to uphold their housing contracts because students lack other housing options and don’t have the resources to hold their landlords accountable. In an investigation conducted by the Daily Trojan last spring, several students reported that Mosaic Student Communities, one of the largest student housing companies around campus, delayed responding to complaints. One student reported a termite infestation that was left unaddressed for a month. The Delta Kappa Alpha house, which is owned by Mosaic, never had a broken front door lock replaced — a safety concern that persisted for two years.
Students have also opened lawsuits against Mosaic for misusing their security deposits for maintenance repairs, which should have been regularly conducted and shouldered by Mosaic.
One way USC could assist students looking for off-campus housing is by creating a directory list of reputable housing companies and landlords in the area. Students should be able to leave reviews and comments about their experiences, so that future renters have an idea of what to expect. Several universities like the University of Maryland, Boston University and the University of Miami offer databases like this so that their students have an idea of the housing available in the area and know that these companies and landlords are recognized by the University community.
USC could also provide education for first-time renters — whether online on the USC Housing website or in an email to students when they end their on-campus housing contracts. There are many resources online for those who look, but none that are specific to students who live in the University Park area.
While USC may not have the space to provide all of its students guaranteed on-campus housing, it does have an obligation to its students who are left to find housing on their own. USC should provide them the education and resources they need to find an affordable, stable and well-kept place to live.
