Trevor Sochocki | Daily TrojanTaming the Cats · Junior setter Nikki Leonard (left) and senior libero Taylor Whittingham (right) and the Women of Troy prepare for Arizona.
No. 22 USC women’s volleyball hosts Arizona tonight for their second match of the week. The Women of Troy are coming off of a solid four-set victory against Arizona State, while the Wildcats have their first of two Los Angeles matches starting with USC. 
On Wednesday night against the Sun Devils, USC (11-5, 3-2 Pac-12) picked up its 1,000th program win. They’re one of only 17 Division 1 programs in the NCAA to reach that mark. It’s another milestone for head coach Mick Haley, who has led the Women of Troy to their 600th, 700th, 800th and 900th wins as well. 
Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier led the team’s four-set victory with a career-high 22 kills. 
“I have to realize even if I’m a freshman, I have a big impact,” Lanier said. “I just want to do whatever I can for my team at the end of the day.”
She also notched her eighth double-double of the season along with an ace and a block. 
“That’s kind of been a theme on all teams that I played on,” Lanier said. 
Lanier joked that her club coaches used to tell her, “If we lose, it’s your fault.” Haley laughed, tapping her on the shoulder saying, “maybe I’ll try that.”
Lanier was joined by junior opposite Niki Withers and sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford in the double-digit kill club. Each of them put up 12 kills. This strong offense is something that will carry the Women of Troy through their grueling Pac-12 schedule. Strong offensive play comes from good passing, something that senior libero and captain Taylor Whittingham brings to the team. 
“She’s our captain, she’s consistent and we want to have her in there,” Haley said. “Even if it’s on one leg.”
While Whittingham stabilizes the Women of Troy’s defense, she also brings a mature presence to her teammates on the court. 
“I really pride myself on being a calming force out there,” Whittingham said. “Anyway that I can help others and they can help me in return is something that’s important.”
As they prep for the Wildcats (10-6, 2-2 Pac-12), Haley wants to see his team continue to improve. Since day one this season, they’re a team that’s been getting better through each match for the most part. They’ve had some hiccups here and there, but minor ones.
 “I think now they’re starting to get their confidence,” Haley said. “We just need to be a little bit more consistent in our offensive execution and a little bit better in defense.”
To limit Arizona, USC will have to find a way to stop sophomore outside hitter Kendra Dahlke. She leads the Wildcats with 204 kills, averaging 4.08 kills per set. To put that in comparison, Lanier has 229 kills on the season and averages 3.88 kills per set. 
In terms of defense, Haley would like to see continued improvement from the middle backs. Against Colorado, the team tallied up 89 digs. Against Arizona State, they only had 61. With the drop off, Haley wants to see more of an effort from his middle backs in order to continue their offensive production. 
“[Whittingham], the two middle backs and the setters were digging a lot of balls,” Haley said. “Colorado was a great performance.”
When USC gets more digs, they get more swings on offense. When they get more swings than their opponents, USC will usually win the match. 
“That transition game is the next level for us,” Haley said. “That starts with defense both at the net and then the backcourt.”
The Women of Troy will look to move to 4-2 in the conference with a win against Arizona. The match will start at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

Coming off wins against the No. 4 Pacific Tigers, Concordia Eagles and Fresno Pacific Sunbirds, the No. 3 men’s water polo team (12-1) play host to the No. 8 Pepperdine Waves (8-5) this Friday in yet another battle between two top 25 teams.
The Trojans have rebounded from their only loss of the season to Cal by demolishing the defenses of Pacific (12-3), Concordia (21-2) and Fresno Pacific (21-3). The Trojans put up 15 goals against Pacific the last time they played and 21 goals against both Concordia and Fresno Pacific.
Due to a combination of an efficient offense and a suffocating defense, the Trojans head into Friday’s contest confident.
“We have proved to ourselves that we can play really well,” freshman driver Marin Dasic said. “When we’re all on the same page, we can beat anyone. We are the better team, and I think we should be able to win without any doubts.”
The Waves are coming off of a four-game losing streak, having lost to UCLA, Stanford, UCSB and Pacific by a combined score of 46-29. Of those four teams, the Trojans have played Stanford, Pacific and UC Santa Barbara, but have won every game by a combined 28 goals.
To Pepperdine’s credit, the Waves have wins over No. 17 UC Irvine and a Loyola Marymount team that sits just outside the rankings by an average margin of victory of 5.5.
Offensively, Pepperdine relies on a trio of scorers — Marko Asic (38 goals, five assists), Mark Urban (21 goals, 15 assists) and Mate Toth (26 goals, two assists) — to get the job done. Asic, the team’s leading goal scorer, finds a way to get the ball past outstretched defenders despite standing at just 6-foot-1.
Contrary to USC’s roster that features only two sub-6-foot players, Pepperdine has six. The Men of Troy could utilize their size against Pepperdine, especially with top scorers junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards who has 21 goals and junior driver Grant Stein who has scored 19 times who are both 6-foot-5.
After USC’s win over Pacific, Stein referenced how Pacific’s utilization of their “center” plays gave USC’s defense fits all game long. Against the Trojans, the Waves could roll out 6-foot-8 center Cristian Bridley to institute centering plays to control USC’s defensive zone.
In terms of Pepperdine’s defense, goalie Zack Rhodes has tallied a 54.6 save percentage with 142 saves to 118 goals allowed.
Overall, junior utility Mihajlo Milicevic and the Men of Troy believe that their Friday game with Pepperdine will be yet another stepping stone to an NCAA title.
“Right now our confidence is up,” Milicevic said. “We have to prepare for them of course, but we’re not preparing to beat Pepperdine; we’re preparing to win the championship. So, Pepperdine is just one opponent on our way to achieving that goal.”

Juliette Pisani | Daily TrojanTimber! · Senior midfielder Morgan Andrews (left) scored twice as the Trojans upset No. 1 Stanford to keep their win streak alive.
The women’s soccer team welcomed the nation’s top team to McAlister Field on Thursday, as No. 1 Stanford came to Los Angeles looking to snap the Women of Troy’s nine-game win streak. A perfect month of September (7-0) catapulted USC to No. 7 in the NSCAA Coaches poll, and the squad kept rolling against the Cardinal, earning its 10th win on the trot and setting a new program record in a 3-0 victory.
The Women of Troy were adventurous from the start of the match, but they struggled to establish sustained periods of possession. The Stanford midfield dictated the game in the opening minutes with an aggressive, high line, pressing USC into numerous turnovers.
“We didn’t hold the ball in some moments and our composure in some moments wasn’t great, but these are the games that help you measure where you really want to be at the end of the year,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “This is a good barometer: We now know we can play them and what we have to do to improve in games like this.”
But despite several Cardinal opportunities in the first 20 minutes, the Trojan defense held firm, and USC began to find its footing as the half progressed. It didn’t take long for the Women of Troy to click into their familiar tempo and find the breakthrough.
Senior midfielder Mandy Freeman controlled the ball in the center of the park in the 28th minute and performed almost a full pirouette to roll her marker. Freeman set Morgan Andrews free in the penalty area, and the senior roofed a left-footed shot to put the Cardinal behind for the first time this season, continuing the Women of Troy’s penchant for scoring in spectacular fashion this year.
Another highlight-reel goal followed in the second half, when sophomore Leah Pruitt sprung a Trojan counterattack in the 56th minute. She passed to redshirt junior Alex Anthony in midfield, and the forward noticed Stanford keeper Alison Jahansouz straying from her net. Anthony was closer to the halfway line than the goal line when she lifted a shot over Jahansouz to double USC’s lead.
“I saw their backline sort of drop off me, which gave me space to turn, and then once I turned and looked up, I saw the keeper was close to 18 yards off her line,” Anthony said. “I saw an open net … so I shot.”
The second half played out much like the first did: The Cardinal doggedly pursued their first goal, and the Women of Troy turned them away while looking to quickly flip the field.  The Trojan game plan worked to perfection, and Andrews notched her second goal with a tap-in in the 78th minute to put the result beyond doubt. Junior Sydney Sladek cut diagonally into the Cardinal box and passed across the keeper, setting Andrews up with an open net.
After a resounding win over the nation’s top dog, McAlpine was confident the Women of Troy were ready to entrench themselves among college soccer’s elite. He said Thursday’s victory solidified the program’s respect but also stressed that the team now had to learn to play “as a frontrunner and not as an underdog.”
Anthony agreed and credited her coach for USC’s current position.
“It’s a huge testament to what Keidane has done for this program,” she said. “I think we’re back on the soccer scene for sure, and we’re going to start getting the recognition I think the team deserves.”
But McAlpine was keen to ensure the squad didn’t get ahead of itself, saying there was still work to be done with No. 14 Cal visiting McAlister Field on Sunday. But there is no denying their recent success, and the Women of Troy are brimming with confidence.
“I think every team thinks they’re the best team in the country,” Anthony said, “and I would not say any differently about us. [This win] is a very exciting stepping stone, and I’m looking forward to what the rest of the season has to offer.”
Congrats to the Women for a solid win over Stanford. Keep the momentum going. It is important to peak
during the playoffs like the team that won it all a number of years ago.

Want to know one play that epitomizes USC’s season thus far? Wind back the tape to about 40 seconds left in the first quarter of last week’s game against Arizona State and watch a trick play almost turn into a catastrophe, yet somehow work out.
Redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold handed the ball off to senior running back Justin Davis, whose return flip to Darnold landed on the ground. But Darnold picked it up and, while running and escaping pressure, heaved a deep ball downfield for sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett for a big gain.
It was an incredible play, done by a quarterback who has shown a knack for making something out of nothing. 
“From disaster to dazzling!” yelled play-by-play man Joe Davis on the FOX broadcast. At the risk of extending a metaphor far too deep, that essentially has been the Trojans’ season in a play: one long, broken-up flea-flicker — except the ball is still in the air.
If the hype surrounding Darnold now is “dazzling,” then the way USC approached the first part of its daunting schedule was the disaster — or the errant Davis flip. From making (what we now know) was the wrong choice at starting quarterback to the beatdowns the Trojans received at the hands of Alabama and Stanford, few saw the pre-season ranked No. 20 team in the nation dropping that low, that fast.
Likewise, few can see a flea-flicker coming. It starts off like any other regular play: A straight handoff from quarterback to running back, who will try to plow his way upfield — pretty standard stuff. But then the running back tosses it back to the quarterback, and everyone is caught off guard. The defense panics: “It’s going to be a pass? Who’s open downfield? What are they doing?”
This was head coach Clay Helton replacing redshirt junior Max Browne at quarterback with Darnold, a decision that had supporters and critics alike wondering what was happening. This was the gamble, the risk of throwing a redshirt freshman into the teeth of the tough Pac-12 conference and watching him crumble, but the potential for an astronomical reward — like a flea-flicker resulting in either a huge loss of yardage or a big play downfield.
Unlike his punting decisions, Helton stood firm and rolled the dice — and in came the “dazzling.” There is no metaphor here because this is literally Darnold. This is Darnold having the sense of awareness to save a turnover, and — instead of throwing it away — buy enough time to uncork a perfect throw on the run 40 yards downfield. 
For the purpose of this hypothetical universe, though, the ball is still in the air, and Burnett has not yet caught it. This is where Darnold’s career track sits at the moment, with his potential and intangibles clear as day but his sample size still small.
Against Arizona State, Darnold showed just how high his ceiling is. He moved and threw left, right and center. He slipped away from seemingly inevitable sacks like his uniform was covered in grease. He made throws in scramble mode with so much zip and accuracy that he could have been throwing from the pocket with plenty of time. He made Helton look like a genius, which is not a very easy task these days.
Besides the Utah State win, the shellacking of Arizona State was the first time USC fans walked away from a game this season feeling confident and with nothing negative to gripe about. To me, it almost felt strange, serving as a wake-up call that yes, this is the USC team we all expected to see this season — only nobody thought we’d have to wait until the fifth week and endure a 1-3 start and a quarterback change to witness it.
We are indeed in the middle of a theoretical flea-flicker, and the difficult parts — the handoff, the pass back, the potential for a turnover — appear to be over. It took a while, but the Trojans finally have the team they want out there. They have found the right quarterback, the right balance between the run and pass game, the defense that can stop a formidable offense such as ASU and — like it or not — the head coach their players generally want to play and win for.
But in sports, success can be fleeting and the good feelings will only last until the next loss. In order for this flea-flicker to be complete — for Burnett to make that diving catch — USC has to repeat last Saturday’s performance against Colorado and get back to .500. Darnold has to pick up right where he left off and continue to be the mobile, accurate, flashy quarterback that has fans salivating, and the rest of the team has to follow suit. Never mind that the Buffaloes are the ranked team and USC is not. No one has to remind this team that — by USC standards — a .500 record this late into the season is a cause for concern, much less a 2-4 record.
A loss to Colorado means the flea-flicker is looking more and more like the wrong play call; a win extends the arc on the ball making its way downfield. It’s now up to Darnold to erase the “disaster” and complete its transformation into a word that describes both the San Clemente product and a word that USC hopes will come to define this season: dazzling.

Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanDashing Davis · Senior running back Justin Davis and the Trojans are facing their fourth-ranked opponent of the season in No. 21 Colorado. Davis has rushed for over 100 yards in two consecutive games.
The Trojan football team has a chance to get back to .500 on the season when they face the No. 21 Colorado Buffaloes at the Coliseum Saturday. Last week, the Trojans defeated unranked ASU 41-21 while the Buffs were on their way to a 47-6 smack down of Oregon State.
Colorado is in an unusual position, leading the division for the first time since 2007 when they were still a member of the Big 12 conference. Last week’s victory was their largest margin of victory in 24 years and they are off to their best start since 2005, the same year they had their last national ranking.
USC is 10-0 in meetings against Colorado, but this year’s Buffalo team is one of the most experienced the Trojans have had to face. Head coach Clay Helton said he was very impressed with the Colorado team as a whole as they have grown from last season.
“We saw them last year, game after game, losing close games,” Helton said. “We walked away from our game saying, ‘Wow. When they mature, they are really going to have something here,’ and lo and behold it’s a year later and they’re doing wonderful things.”
Colorado has a balanced and talented offense, ranking third in the Pac-12 in both passing and rushing. Though the Buffs haven’t announced a quarterback for this game, both have been performing at a high level.
Senior quarterback Sefo Liufau started the first three games of the season before injuring his ankle. In that time he put up 768 yards and six touchdowns. Replacing him for the last two starts has been freshman quarterback Steven Montez. Montez immediately impressed after throwing for 743 yards, eight passing touchdowns and one rushing.
“Both QB’s play the same way,” junior defensive back Jonathan Lockett said. “Same body type and same style of running.”
Helton said that because of the similarities between the two possible starters, the defense has prepared only one defensive game plan.
“I went back and watched film and figured out how they put this many points on Michigan, how they put this many points on Oregon, on Oregon State, and they’re really improved from the past two years,” graduate transfer defensive end Stevie Tu’ikolovatu said. “I’m impressed.”
The Buffs also boast the top-ranked defense in the conference and are returning nine starters. Colorado is especially known for their tough front seven, which could provide problems for a Trojan run game that has stuttered at times. 
However, senior running back Justin Davis is coming off of his second straight 100-yard game. Davis credited the offensive line for contributing to his success.
“They’ve just been working their butts off all week and stuff’s starting to click,” Davis said. “We always have room for improvement. We can’t stop there because we’ve still got some very hard teams ahead of us.”
On the offensive line though, the praise has been for offensive line coach Neil Callaway.
“Give it up to coach Callaway,” redshirt junior center Nico Falah said. “They’re a really good defensive front. Coach Callaway’s doing his best to get us ready for their schemes, their defensive line games and everything.”
The offensive line will most likely be without senior captain and right tackle Zach Banner who is listed as doubtful with an ankle injury. The team will also probably be without redshirt freshman safety Ykili Ross, who has a shoulder injury and is listed as doubtful according to Helton. Redshirt senior Jabari Ruffin, who is recovering from a concussion, is 50-50.
The matchup between USC and Colorado begins at 1 p.m. at the Coliseum and is being televised nationally on Pac-12 Network.

Nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m. For this particular story, confessions of love after 2 a.m. don’t always go reciprocated.
For the purpose of anonymity, her name in this column will be Sarah. Sarah, who I had recently met, was pretty cool on first impression. We had hung out with each other a couple of times before, but something seemed different that night. 
We were hanging out on the bleachers, similar to what you would see in a cool, coming-of-age movie (super exciting for this foreign Aussie bloke). The air was cold and I was wondering why she called me to come see her so late at night.
Sarah was clearly very nervous. And so, nosy me went ahead and began the interrogation process. “What’s up?” “How have you been? ““Anything new? Is there something on your mind?”
She deflected and dodged my barrage of questions until I asked obliviously: “Any new boy drama in your life?” 
The warm air from my question lingered longer than usual in the cold of the night. She looked at me in the eye and took a deep breath.
“Yeah. It’s you,” she relented.
My last semester at Carnegie Mellon University before I transferred to USC was interesting. I had four girls confess their feelings for me — all in the span of one semester. Using the business analysis skills and critical thinking that I had learned, I recognized that this was a particular spike when mapped against the usual frequency of females confessing their love to me (from zero ever to four over a few months). What a puzzling phenomenon, I thought to myself. Did that new haircut I got at SuperCuts from Jamie do the trick? Or was it romantic to some that I was about to leave Pittsburgh for good and long-distance relationships have an amazing track record. So yeah sure, let’s go for it with this weird Australian who I just met?
I was really perplexed why these girls that I had met during this final semester at Carnegie Mellon were telling me they were in love with me. I was pretty sure that I established some clear guidelines going into them. I told Sarah that I was not looking for a relationship, I was about to leave and I saw her as a friend. Why this anomaly of a spike in interest in me?
I always started with asking if I had led these girls on because I felt bad. These were good friends of mine that I didn’t want to see hurt. But each of them said no, I hadn’t led them on. 
My ego kicked in for a bit when I wrongfully assumed I was just freakin’ awesome and the gym had finally paid dividends. But deep down, I knew that there had to be something different about this time of my life that had some of these girls telling me that they liked me. 
Otherwise, I would have had that happen all the time (and that would be awesome!).
They thought that they liked me. But they didn’t. It seems that they liked a certain side of me, and they felt like they really knew me. But as I asked for reasons why they liked me, it became clear that they really didn’t know me, and had constructed an image of the dynamic of our relationship in their heads. One girl told me she had never felt “known” like this before and there was something different about the way we interacted, which was weird, because I only knew her for two weeks.
Looking back at that semester, I’ve concluded that I might be the one to blame. I created feelings that otherwise would not have been there if the circumstance was different. It’s not that I led them on with flirtatious comments or with hand drawn letters (my penmanship is hot), but we artificially created a sense of closeness that wasn’t real. 
In my last semester at CMU, I really wanted to speed my new friendships up because I knew I was leaving. Let’s pack months into a few days, I thought to myself at the time. I would hang out with someone new and see them quite often and engage in pretty deep conversations from the get-go. 
We felt like we really knew each other and the relationship was solid. But after a few weeks and changes in season (literal and metaphorical), these girls that confessed to me quite frankly were not attracted to me the way they thought they were in the face of frequent and deep hangouts.
It made me think about an idea: Perhaps people often mistake the speed of a relationship for the depth of one. We think that we can create genuine, strong relationships if we speed things up. That can be emotionally by opening up, or physically too by subscribing to Netflix. 
What a weird place college is where we feel like we have known certain people forever but in actuality we have only known them for about a one month (looking at you college freshmen who think they have truly found “the one’” already. It’s only October!).
These girls didn’t really know me because they only saw me in a certain season of my life. We cannot instantly show someone who we truly are with all our depth and complexity and nuances, even if we want to. 
A true understanding of someone’s character cannot be manufactured by deep conversations or a higher velocity of interaction. The only way to truly know someone and be deeply attracted to them is through time. It’s in the different seasons of life that we see people in different stanzas and different keys of their life. 
The harmony might be nice for now because you both are in a certain place, but wait a little and recognize that true, deep relationships are about people who can transition with you through different verses and stanzas. You might find that the harmony you thought you had can become a beautifully placed dissonance that you would not have appreciated and been shocked by had you been lied to by the speed of your relationship.
My challenge today to all of you is not to necessarily become celibate and cold and look at that cute cat shelter in downtown, but rather to not get caught up in the speed of everything happening around USC. In our impatient, instant gratification world, where faster is better, perhaps it would be beneficial to us all in our dating relationships to take a breather and take it slow.

Photo courtesy of Victor LuoI’ve got your back(pack) · Vince Durden, a Los Angeles-based accessory brand, created a line of eco-friendly cork backpacks. The cork that the backpacks are made of can be stripped without being harmed.
Los Angeles-based accessory brand Vince Durden is in the process of creating the world’s most eco-friendly backpack. On Thursday, the brand announced that it will be raising funds via a rewards/equity crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 
The company is setting out to raise $2000 within 30 days to finish development and produce the first batch of their new product design. 
Created by USC computer science/business administration student junior Hexi Xiao and USC alum Hubert Mou, Vince Durden aims to design and create backpacks that are made from completely sustainable materials. They strive for an aesthetic that is both modern and stylish, with a natural and minimalist twist.
“These days, people get caught up in the pressures and demands of the daily work and school grind. We want our products to inspire people to appreciate the natural beauty that surrounds us and how we can incorporate that natural beauty into everyday, sustainable designs,” Xiao said.
Xiao explained that the inspiration behind his brand name Vince Durden was inspired by his two favorite characters, Vince Chase from TV series Entourage and Tyler Durden from the film Fight Club. He admires both Durden and Chase’s ambition and love for life. These are the traits that he wants his customers, his brand and his backpacks to embody. 
“I want Vince Durden to represent those who wake up with a big smile, who have their own story to tell and who live every moment on this earth to its fullest.”
Xiao and Mou first learned of the sustainable benefits of cork skin when they serendipitously saw a video about cork on a TED Talk by chef and restaurant owner  Patrick Spencer. The TEDxSaken talk, “From bark to bottle,” explained how Spencer focused on sustainable business practices to expand his career. 
Xiao and Mou were inspired and motivated by Spencer’s story and how he became a world leader in both conservation and entrepreneurship and decided to follow in his footsteps. 
Vince Durden prides itself on the backpack’s cork skin, which is shaved from the outer layer of the cork oak tree. The material is the single most sustainable and environmentally friendly resource.
Vince Durden goes through intensive manufacturing processes. 
In production, the cork regenerates itself every nine years and shaving the bark doesn’t harm the tree, but rather helps it grow stronger to live up to 300 years. The entire production process is free of pollution. 
The accessory brand hopes to make the dream, which combining fashion and environment, come true. Those who want to back the project can go on vincedurden.com. You can follow the brand on Instagram at @vince_durden. 
Vince Durden is on its way to fulfilling its dream of not only environmentally conscious, but elegant and simple backpacks.Xiao hopes that the brand will become a go-to for both aesthetic and sustainability purposes. Each backpack is currently priced at $95.  Vince Durden exists for one sole purpose — to be a symbol for a lifestyle that combines a love for fashion and appreciation for nature.

Situated on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and under the trendy Elysian lofts of Echo Park, Winsome is an all-day restaurant redefining American cuisine with a Californian twist. Owners Marc Rose and Med Abrous are mixing contemporary diner eating with a sultry ambiance that caters to young crowds residing in Central L.A.
The restaurant’s atmosphere is relaxing, with candles lining each table and the light bass of soulful hip-hop thumping in the background. The fast and focused action of the chefs at work in the open kitchen can be viewed from the wood-top bar. If sitting outside is preferred, the spacious outdoor patio continues the relaxed ambiance from the inside with overhead string lights and wooden chairs. Winsome keeps the focus on the food with the menus only displaying the menu item and the price on simple medium-sized white paper. 
The breakfast and brunch menu boasts a multitude of options for restaurant-goers, with the duck egg toast being one of the more popular items on the list. This savory dish features components such as rustic toast, raclette cheese and oregano. The duck egg raises the price of this simpler dish to $15, making it not as budget friendly as it could be. For $6 less, the shelling bean and whipped feta spread on rustic toast is a great alternative without sacrificing taste. Items such as toast, bacon and fried egg can be ordered a la carte for a simpler breakfast or an addition to these bigger menu items. 
Photo courtesy of WinsomeYou winsome, you lose some · Winsome, a vibrant neighborhood restaurant in Echo Park, features a walk-up coffee window and patio seating It is also available for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During lunchtime, Winsome offers various salads and sandwiches to curb midday hunger. The speck and comte grilled cheese sandwich is a fan favorite of the restaurant, containing mostarda and Thai basil. Another highly requested dish is the crispy tofu, consisting of meiji tofu, raw peppers and puffed red wheat berries. There is also a wide variety of pastries available to order, including a delicious brûléed caramel rye brownie and a blueberry spelt muffin. 
As dinner time rolls around, the menu is shortened and focuses on around 14 key items. Listed as a “snack,” the Kennebec potato chips satisfy both college students’ budgets and taste buds. For $5, a medium-sized bowl is filled to the rim with crispy sliced potato discs and dusted with herbs. The edges of the chips had a delightful crunch with a tender middle. Visually, the chips were consistent, with each piece being pleasantly golden. 
The seasoning consisted of herbs that offered more to the potatoes than regular salt could ever do. It offered a fresh, garlic-based complement to the chips that did not overpower. Complementary to the appetizer is a tangy, lime-based white cream sauce. The sauce is light and slightly acidic, which provides contrast to the starchy texture of potato. Overall, the appetizer was satisfying and great as a starter to share among a group. 
Looking throughout the menu, the item that stood out immediately was the roasted bone marrow rosti. Served rustically in-bone on a white plate, the bone marrow is crusted with herbs and oil. Alongside is the potato rosti, with vibrantly pink watermelon radish and deep green nasturtium leaves. Included with these components were the subtly spicy red fresno chile and caramelized pearl onions. The vegetables helped cut through the savory bone marrow, while the raclette cheese added saltiness along with the marrow. At $16, this dish is not one to be consumed on a daily basis. On a night out with a couple of friends or a special celebration, however, this dish is the perfect complement. The roasted fall squash is a less expensive option, at around $12, and features dandelion greens and toasted lemongrass. 
As a sweet end to a meal, Winsome offers four different desserts to choose from, with a starting price at $9. As suggested by the waiter, the banana tres leches with passion fruit geleé has been a staple of the restaurant since it opened. The dessert was presented in a white shallow bowl, with the cake sitting in a light pool of milk and cream.
The beautiful canary yellow of the passion fruit geleé and the brûléed banana slices took the presentation of the dish to the next level. The tres leches was executed beautifully, with the cake moist and saturated with just the right amount of milk. Atop and surrounding the cake were clusters of the passion fruit geleé, adding a bright fruit flavor to the sweet layers of cake. The brûléed banana slices infused the cake with a tropical banana flavor in every bite. Although this is on the pricier side at $9, the presentation and flavor are unparalleled. 
As the menu states, the main dishes of the meal are meant to be shared, implying that the cost will be split among those sharing. With this in mind, the prices are not unreasonably high for groups. These dishes would then, however, have to be eaten sparingly for those tight on money. With that being said, the food is delicious and the service is impeccable. 
Winsome is open for breakfast, brunch and lunch everyday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Dinner is served Wednesday through Monday from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday.

The call for the NCAA to compensate its student-athletes is nothing new. Former athletes have waged lawsuit after lawsuit and critics have questioned how the NCAA has maintained its nonprofit status and defense of calling student-athletes “amateurs” while generating nearly $1 billion in annual revenue.
 Last Wednesday, we covered former USC football player Lamar Dawson’s decision to sue the NCAA and the Pac-12 over wages. It is a narrower lawsuit than most, though, contending that revenue-generating programs such as football receive different treatment from their schools than non-revenue sports. Thus, rather than all athletes receiving pay, the suit contends that because athletes in profit-driving sports create revenue, they are deserving of compensation while those in non-revenue programs are not.
Our stance on this is two-fold. In general, we support compensation for college athletes beyond scholarships, but limiting that compensation to only athletes in revenue-generating sports while ignoring non-revenue programs creates complexities that do more harm than good.
For all the glitz, glamour and revenue that a football team receives — especially at USC — there are far more Division I sports that struggle to break even, and it is often up to the revenue generated from football to fund non-revenue sports such as lacrosse or rowing.
According to last year’s annual Equity in Athletics report, USC made nearly $106 million in revenue off all teams from 2014-2015, with football pulling in almost $46 million by itself. But the $15 million profit that football generated was the lone net positive among all sports. Take away football and basketball, and the University would have lost about $2 million on athletics.
Look at statistics across other institutions — public or private — and the numbers are similar, if not greater. In the same report, the University of Oregon recorded a $15 million loss in sports other than football and basketball; UCLA lost more than $17 million. 
Frankly, the main reason some less popular sports have not been cut is because of the football revenue used to prop them up. If this money were to instead be spent on compensating football players, the attention and funds toward other sports would fall  — and under the terms of Dawson’s lawsuit, athletes in, say, swimming or beach volleyball, wouldn’t even receive compensation because of their lack of comparative importance to the school.
Not only would it deplete the athletic department as a whole — as some of the football revenue goes toward renovating facilities and making improvements across the board — but i It also sends a message to the women’s cross country runner doing two-a-days or the men’s golf player out on the course from dawn ‘till dusk that they don’t matter as much simply because they don’t play football.
Emilie Skoog | Daily Trojan
The counterargument that Mark Rifkin — one of the lawyers representing Dawson in the case — presented to the Daily Trojan earlier this week is that there is a “clear difference” between football and non-revenue generating sports such as track and field, and that’s fair. Football is far more prominent around campus than another other sport; USC fans are more likely to know the name of every member of the football team’s offensive line than the track and field team’s fastest runner. Football is essentially a business in the way it has sponsors and operates ticket sales, and the lawsuit contends that because a small amount of athletes produce a majority of revenue, they are entitled to special compensation.
It sounds rational, but there are better ways to reward these athletes without having it come at the expense of others. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon’s lawsuit against the NCAA, a case that argued the organization violated antitrust laws and should compensate athletes for using their name and likeness in commercial uses such as video games. Instead, the ruling of a federal appeals court last year that allows colleges to restrict compensation to scholarships and a few thousand dollars for the “cost of attendance” stands.
Having the highest court in the country hear this case was unlikely, but still a disappointment because O’Bannon argued for the most cogent method to fairly reward athletes: Allow them to have the rights to their own likeness, and, by extension, pursue sponsorships and endorsements and profit off their jersey sales and camps. This way, higher-profile athletes such as football players get the attention and compensation they deserve and lesser-known sports are not affected.
To the point the O’Bannon case makes, the notion that the NCAA must protect its athletes’ “amateurism” by restricting their ability to profit off themselves is ironic, considering that it relies on and promotes the hell out of these same athletes to generate a billion-dollar revenue for itself. Not only is this unfair, but it also results in tough decisions for young athletes.
Look at Katie Ledecky, the U.S. Olympic swimmer who brought home five gold medals from Rio and became an international superstar over the summer. She gave up millions of dollars in advertisements, sponsorships and the like to attend Stanford University, choosing an education over financial security for a lifetime. Sure, Ledecky could turn pro if she leaves school, but to put her through the choice of getting a college degree or profiting off her own accomplishments at the peak of her career benefits nobody but the NCAA, which now has the rights to her likeness and will surely market her name to sell merchandise and gear — of which Ledecky will receive none of the profit.
Ledecky’s situation ties in with our stance: Let her make money on her own accord, off her own success, without affecting funds that would otherwise be going toward improving the school’s athletic department as whole. Her choice financially benefits no one but the NCAA.
The “pay for play” issue is not going to go away soon. There will be more lawsuits, more editorials and more arguments raised, and the nuanced take we have on the issue shows its complexity. But ultimately, it’s unethical for the NCAA to claim “scholarships” and “amateurism” as its sole points of defense while reaping in money and subjecting its student-athletes to a schedule akin to that of an employee — on top of taking classes — and refusing to allow them to make a cent off of it.

The gap between low-income and high-achieving can be closed with just a little thought and care on behalf of a successful program. The relationship between Foshay Learning Center and USC is one that other universities should seek to emulate. Foshay sent more students to USC this fall than any other public or private high school in the nation, a testament to the school’s rigorous academic standards. Students enter the program as sixth graders and must maintain at least a C average. Moreover, the program requires parental involvement — families must commit to attending workshops after school on topics like planning for college. Students also have to attend summer school each summer, and classes on Saturdays for half of the year. While many graduates of Foshay’s program attend USC, others go on to prestigious Ivy Leagues like Harvard. 
USC initially began its relationship with Foshay as a partnership between the learning center and USC’s schools of Education and Social Work. Its aims were to provide a prestigious education combined with reduced-cost or cost-free health care, meals and educational supplies to strengthen the community’s future.
Perhaps most noteworthy is that USC does not lower admissions standards to favor Foshay graduates; rather, the University commits to helping the Foshay students raise themselves up. With 93 percent of Foshay students coming from low-income families, and an 80 percent Latino and about 20 percent black student demographic make-up, this program helps Foshay students overcome educational attainment barriers. For an urban school like Foshay, students may have lower access to resources they need to succeed. 
Thus, the partnership between USC and Foshay is mutually beneficial, as it allows USC more access to high achieving students, and allows Foshay students greater access to a college preparatory curriculum. Such relationships between schools in an urban area and a local university help students with a lower socioeconomic status overcome educational opportunity barriers, while strengthening ties within the community. 
The median income of the University Park region, where both Foshay and USC are located, is $18,533 — low for the city and county of Los Angeles. Additionally, the crime rate of 231.5 crimes per 10,000 people is higher than the average of other regions surrounding University Park. Foshay’s location in an urban setting, in conjunction with lower median income and higher crime rates than other nearby regions, puts students at an increased risk for lower educational attainment. 
Various social justice and equity issues, such as poverty, drug use and violence, appear frequently in urban classrooms because the term urban is associated with students from nondominant racial, ethnic, linguistic and economic backgrounds. This negative association between society’s issues and urban students cause educators to view these students as deficient, which potentially allows for less educational opportunity, and further impacts a student’s educational attainment. 
While these issues do appear in all schools, no matter the wealth of the students’ families, poverty is one of the biggest factors in contributing to a student’s success in education. Mathematics classes in high-poverty high schools are twice as likely to be taught by a teacher with  credentials in a subject other than mathematics than at a low-poverty school. Teachers in high-poverty schools also more often report having to work with outdated textbooks technology, and inadequate science equipment. Moreover, the amount and variety of college-preparatory or Advanced Placement course offerings are significantly lower in schools with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus, conditions in high-poverty schools too often render them sites of developmental risk rather than places of competent assets that would enhance student developmental outcomes. 
The transition to college requires more than just academic preparation, but urban youth face motivational barriers and bleak schooling circumstances that hinder their academic performance. In school systems with inadequate resources, the school’s potential to have a direct impact on students’ successful transition to college is disrupted. 
Thus, the unique opportunity that Foshay has to partner with USC helps to ensure that its students will succeed. This program helps change the “question from ‘Am I going to college? Can I go to college? to ‘Which college am I going to?’” Partnerships that involve organizations such as USC which are committed to maintaining a strong and visible presence at a school like Foshay can help establish stable relationships with students despite fluctuations in public funding. These unique relationships between students, Foshay and USC are further strengthened through on-campus events that allow students to connect to the University. Additionally, the partnership between Foshay and USC allows both schools to further their understanding of the challenges faced by urban youth, which will only help the program to continue to succeed.

“How are you not dying of heat? I can barely breathe in here.”
“I don’t know; this is the best it has felt all week. I even felt a little chilly today.”
“You have grown too accustomed to this heat. I am genuinely worried about you.” 
This was the conversation that took place as my friend, a visitor from out of town, stepped out of the elevator and onto the eighth floor of Pardee Tower. She could barely handle the humid, overbearing heat, but I felt fine. I guess you could say my tolerance for heat has changed since starting college and so has my appreciation for hand fans and, of the course the thing I want the most, air conditioning. 
After surviving my first month as a college freshman I have learned a lot: breakfast is extremely hard to make time for when you have an 8am class, you can make it to Parkside Dining Hall in ten minutes if you speed walk, and the library is the only quiet workplace where one can get their work done. However, the most important lesson I have learned: the importance of air conditioning- or therefore the lack of air conditioning. 
Yes, I understand some might say I am being dramatic or the heat is not that bad, but have they ever lived on the top floor of a building with no air conditioning in Los Angeles during September? Probably not, probably not. The heat did not only affect me in the trivial sense, but emotionally and mentally. I can handle it being physically hot or cold, but not when it starts taking a toll on me.
The week of September 26th to October 2nd was one of the hardest because not only did I have two midterms, but also I could not sleep and I felt ill every time I was in my dorm. Along with the stress of studying, I was waking up every night at 4am or 5am gasping for air and profusely sweating. And it was not only me who felt that way, but also my roommate and my whole floor. It made school miserable and unbearable, and I honestly did not know if I was going to mentally make it through the week. 
 I started to slowly unravel. Midterms were too much, being away from home was too much, and the lack of sleep was too much. It was all too much, and all I wanted to do was go home. But Saturday came- and it was gameday- and I finally realized that I not only survived my midterms, but the heat, too. My midterms went well even though I was dehydrated and sleep deprived. I realized that I can survive college and my dorm on the eighth floor – even as the heat rises. 
So, all in all, I’m not saying the heat is okay- because it is not and I miss my air conditioned home, but I learned a lot about myself. College is one big test comprised of minuscule aspects such as surviving our southern California heat or making it to your classes on time. Yes, the heat sucked -and still sucks- but I will get through it and college as well. 
To the people out there that have air conditioners: treasure it and appreciate it because you will never know when you will really need it. I guess for now you will just see me in the library more and my dorm less. But, is that a really a bad thing? Oh, and I can’t wait for cooler temperatures, I truly can’t.

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanCurrent affairs · Journalist Pilar Marrero and professor Sherry Bebitch Jeffe discussed immigration and the election at Wednesday’s event.
A journalist specializing in immigration politics spoke about the treatment of immigrants in the United States and the importance of immigration rhetoric in the 2016 presidential election Wednesday at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy, spoke with Pilar Marrero, a journalist for La Opinion, the largest Spanish-speaking newspaper in the United States. The event, “A Conversation with Pilar Marrero: Toxic Immigration Rhetoric and America’s Future,” was hosted by the USC Judith and John Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise at the Price School. 
Marrero is the author of Killing the American Dream, published in 2012, which archives the last 25 years of immigration policy and the struggles surrounding it in the United States. She has a long history of speaking on social and political issues that deal with the Latino community. She is also covering the 2016 presidential campaign for ImpreMedia, a major Spanish-speaking media outlet.
At Wednesday’s event, Marrero spoke about the political climate around immigration in America and the different approaches each presidential candidate has toward the issue. A recent Gallup poll showed that two-thirds of the Americans oppose the immigration plans advocated by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, which involves building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and deporting illegal immigrants. The poll also found that 84 percent of Americans favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, a plan that is backed by the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
“This opinion about immigration among the American public changes depending on the moment and the economic conditions,” Marrero said. “In terms of the national Gallup measures, you find that opinions on immigration changed right after 9/11. It started changing slowly until today, when most of the Americans see immigration as positive.”
According to Marrero, politicians are usually out of step with what majority of the population wants, which is why immigration faces gridlock in Congress despite the apparent national consensus.
“The last time there was an effort to pass immigration reform, it passed in the Senate and it was stopped and never voted on in the House,” Marrero said. “The reason is because House members are elected in small districts, as opposed to the Senators, who are elected state-wise. The politics in small districts are very different from states like California.”
Marrero said that the elites of both major political parties have been disconnected from their base for a while, which has led to anger among voters who are dissatisfied for economic and social reasons, along with racial issues.
“If you look back in our history, right after the Great Depression, working-class whites along with Mexican agricultural workers were suffering,” Marrero said. “But Mexicans and immigrants were the scapegoats, and close to a million were deported.”
Marrero related this historical pattern of behavior to the way that politicians approach current immigrants. According to Marrero, stricter immigration laws enacted after 9/11 affected regular immigrants more than those suspected of being terrorists. At airports, non-citizen workers were fired and different laws were filed targeting immigrants.
“Men from several Middle Eastern countries had to register, and a lot of laws were passed that in reality affected the larger population of immigrants,” Marrero said. “There were really not a lot of terrorists caught at the time.”
Marrero said that the problem lies in the fact that the emphasis is on enforcement of current immigration policies and not on reform.
“I think this is a history that continues to go around, and we are seeing it coming back, year after year,” Marrero said. “We are a country that idealizes its immigrant past, but we don’t want to really deal with our immigrants.”
We must finally face the fact that immigrants and minorities are increasingly a major force in America. They and the children they bear account for 60 percent of our nation’s population growth, own 11 percent of US businesses, and are 60 percent more likely to start a new business than native-born Americans. In fact, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, creating 10 million jobs and seven out of ten top brands in our country.  
   More importantly, the vast majority of these human beings—both legal and undocumented—come to improve their lives and create a foundation of success for their children to build upon, bringing skills and a willingness to work hard to make their dreams a reality, something our founders did four hundred years ago, and something we would do today if we were in their shoes.
   Theodore Roosevelt: “We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.”
   However, most struggle in their efforts and need guidance in Anytown, USA. Perhaps intelligent immigration reform, White House/Congress and business/labor cooperation, concerned citizens and even informative books can extend a helping hand, the same unwavering hand, lest we forget, that has been the anchor and lighthouse of American values for four hundred years.
   One new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help immigrants, int’l students and minorities and is endorsed by ambassadors, educators, and editors is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” 
   Here’s a closing quote from the book’s Intro: “With all of our cultural differences though, you’ll be surprised to learn how much…we as human beings have in common on this little third rock from the sun. After all, the song played at our Disneyland parks around the world is ‘It’s A Small World After All.’ Peace.”
