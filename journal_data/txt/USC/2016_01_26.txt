USC football’s coaching staff is now complete after head coach Clay Helton announced the hiring of Kenechi Udeze, a former Trojans’ All-American defensive end, as defensive line coach.
Udeze served as an assistant strength and conditioning coach for USC last season. He spent three seasons playing for the Trojans from 2001-2003 before declaring for the NFL draft as a redshirt junior.
Helton lauded Udeze’s effectiveness in preparing for the Holiday Bowl and his bright future as a coach.
“There are times in your career when you meet someone and just know that they are going to be a superstar in the profession,” Helton said. “Kenechi is that person. I was blown away by his attention to detail with technique and fundamentals in our recent bowl game preparation … His knowledge of the game is something that is going to be critical to the development of our young defensive line. Kenechi is a Trojan to the core and his passion for USC is felt by all.”
The 32 year-old Udeze was a star during his playing days at USC, where he achieved numerous accolades anchoring former coach Pete Carroll’s defense. He was named to the Freshman All-American second team and as a sophomore, made the All-Pac-10 second team. He had a strong junior campaign, helping the Trojans win a national championship in 2003 when he became the first USC defensive end to be named to the All-American first team since Tim Ryan in 1989. Udeze also led the nation in sacks, averaging 1.3 a game. Over the course of his playing career, he recorded 28 sacks, and his 14 forced fumbles is tied for an NCAA record.
However, Udeze’s NFL career was cut short after he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2008. As the 20th overall pick by Minnesota in 2004, he spent four seasons with the Vikings, where he started in 47 of 51 games. Udeze retired in 2009 after a brief comeback attempt.
Since then, he has served as a coach in some capacity at the collegiate or pro level. After spending three years with the Washington Huskies as an assistant strength and conditioning coach, Udeze worked as an assistant with the Seahawks, Vikings, Steelers and Bills in the NFL.
“You want to make an impact wherever you are, but really, I think it kind of hits home a little more because you see yourself in these young men,” Udeze told the Los Angeles Times when he returned to USC as an assistant strength and conditioning coach last year. “As clueless as they may be coming from high school, like I was, it’s really good to give them what they need.”
With Udeze onboard, Helton appears finished assembling his new coaching staff. Udeze will join Clancy Pendergast, Johnny Nansen, Ronnie Bradford and John Baxter as defensive assistants. The team’s attention will now turn to National Signing Day, a week from Wednesday.

I’ve already decided I don’t have enough room for another football team in my heart. Growing up in Los Angeles during the heyday of the Pete Carroll era, we didn’t need a pro football team. We already had one; it just played on Saturdays.
So when the Rams officially committed to moving from St. Louis to L.A., I was excited, but I haven’t jumped on the bandwagon. Now, the reports of the San Diego Chargers possibly driving up the 5 to join the Rams for the new stadium plan in Inglewood are getting interesting. As of Monday, the talks between the Chargers and Rams owners had stalled, but the possibility of L.A. hosting two teams is very real and still on the table.
As fellow columnist Darian Nourian pointed out last week, this decision is particularly important for USC. While not set in stone just yet, the Rams will almost certainly play in the Coliseum over the next three seasons while the team’s permanent stadium is built in Inglewood. The addition of a second professional team to the mix would have a lot of upside for the University, but could complicate matters for the school as well. Most importantly though, for the sake of USC football’s brand, I think it might actually benefit the Trojans to have a second professional team added to the mix.
USC is certainly a football school, but it is nonetheless primarily a school. So one of the biggest factors when evaluating the future of football from the school’s perspective is what the impact of professional games will have on the school’s academic environment.
Every other Saturday in the fall, campus essentially shuts down as a school and becomes a sports arena. It’s wonderful, a huge part of the Trojan student experience, but rare enough to be special and significant. Not only will the addition of pro football in L.A. make that a two-day experience on campus, but a pair of pro teams playing in L.A. would make it a weekly occurrence rather than biweekly.
Even if school doesn’t allow tailgating directly on campus, parking and traffic will inevitably involve USC facilities, and noise from the stadium certainly won’t be tuned out for the consideration of anyone catching up on schoolwork Sundays.
In addition to the noise, the potential wear and tear on the actual facility could also be significant. The Coliseum maintenance crew would have to repaint the grass after every Saturday, and the impact of three times as many games on the facility might force the school to switch from grass to turf. In the grand scheme of things, these probably aren’t major concerns, and there’s probably enough money going around in the deal to make this all go smoothly.
In fact, the revenue that this could generate for the University is probably the most significant part. USC recently obtained ownership rights to the stadium, and the revenue from renting out the facility to a pro team could bring in millions annually. The University of Minnesota, for example, made about $3 million this past season from the Minnesota Vikings for the right to play in its stadium while the Vikings renovate their permanent home. Multiply that by two if the Chargers come in, and factor in the land value in Los Angeles is a bit more valuable than in the Twin Cities, and USC could make tens of millions of dollars in just a couple years from this endeavor. Of course, that’s not that much money for an institution that has an endowment of more than $5 billion, and most of the rental fee will go toward the $270 million Coliseum renovation planned for 2018. But any figure with two commas is a big, big number, and it’s probably worth the noise of a couple touchdowns over the loudspeaker heard across campus.
For me, though, I think USC should root for the Chargers coming to L.A. as well for the sake of its brand in the city. While the addition of one football team certainly hurts the share of the football market that USC commands, I think adding a second one would put USC back in its place as the city’s football team.
The addition of two pro teams to L.A. would show that the move has much more to do with entertainment than actual football. I do know some friends who have officially already declared allegiance to the Rams as their team, which I totally respect. But if a second team came here, the majority of L.A. fans will almost invariably just jump on the bandwagon of whichever team is doing better in the playoffs.
The Trojans, on the other hand, already have generations of success under their belt. With strings of national championships in the ’30s, ’70s and 2000s, the Trojan brand has survived through even a recent rough patch where the rival Bruins have surged as a legitimate competitor. Unless UCLA puts together a similar string soon, and over multiple decades, football fans of all ages will still remember USC as the dominant power for years to come.
Neither the Chargers nor the Rams would come to L.A. with that legacy of success. They would both still be secure in their most recent cities if they had. Unless one of them emerges as a dominant power in the NFL, rivaling the recent championship runs of the Patriots, Steelers or Giants, Los Angeles will still be USC’s town.

Tuesday night the Trojans (1-6, 1-4 MPSF) earned their first win of the season by upsetting the No. 8 Pepperdine Waves (4-2, 3-2 MPSF) at the Galen Center (25-23, 25-19, 19-25, 21-25, 15-11). This marked the first time since the end of the 2013 season that the Trojans were unranked.
Sophomore opposite Jon Rivera had a career night with 23 kills. He hit .302 in the match and had two blocks and five digs. While Rivera had a career night, he remained focused on the team getting their first win of the season.
“I always go to every game and go as hard as I can,” Rivera said. “I’m just trying to get kills for the team and be aggressive.”
Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh, in his second match of the season, recorded 11 kills while hitting .611 and had two aces, four digs and 1.5 blocks.
“I think I’ve stepped more into the leadership role this year,” Benesh said. “I give more tactical advice than motivation.”
The Trojans came out to a fast start in the first set, taking a quick 9-7 lead. The Waves battled back and eventually took the lead at 18-16. The Trojans went on a three-point run to take the lead 19-18.
Senior outside hitter Alex Slaught nailed an ace on the back line to tie the set at 22-all. Rivera nabbed the Trojans the lead with a kill, 23-22. Slaught tallied another ace to get USC set point. The Waves got a kill to make it 24-23 USC, but a Pepperdine service error would get the Trojans the first set, 25-23.
Rivera led the team in the first set with four kills while hitting .667.
This is only the second time this season that the Trojans won the first set of a match.
Similar to the first set, the second set was neck-and-neck between the Trojans and the Waves.
Once the Men of Troy took the lead at 6-5, they hit their stride and ran away with the set. Benesh scored off a quick kill to get the Trojans to 24-19. A Pepperdine hitting error would get the Trojans the second set, 25-19.
Strong blocking from middle blockers Benesh and senior Tommy Leonard solidified the Trojans’ dominance defensively at the net in the second set.
Rivera once again had a solid set, recording five kills while hitting .571 overall.
Even though they were down 2-0 in the match, Pepperdine didn’t go down without a fight. They took the lead in the third set from the first point. The Waves’ maintained their lead throughout the entirety of the set. USC came within two after a huge block from Benesh, 16-14, causing Pepperdine to call a timeout.
The Trojans would try to tie the set, but they just couldn’t catch the Waves. Pepperdine flipped the script of the second set and won the third set off of an ace, 25-19.
Even though USC dropped the set, Rivera continued to hit the ball well. He picked up another five kills in the third while hitting .400 overall.
In the fourth set, the Trojans came out with a renewed energy. USC took control early following a block from Rivera, 3-1.
The Trojans maintained the lead up until the Waves tied it up at 14-all and then took the lead off of a miss hit by the Trojans, 15-14. The Trojans called a timeout to try and slow down the Waves.
Coming out of the timeout, Benesh scored a quick kill to tie it at 15-all. From that point, the Waves outscored the Trojans 7-2 before USC called a timeout, 22-17.
Pepperdine would go on to score two of three to get to 24-18, but the Trojans scored three-in-a-row to make it 24-21 before the Waves called a timeout. Immediately after the timeout, Pepperdine recorded a kill to take the set 25-21 and send it to the fifth set.
Nygaard took time to calm his team down and get them focused on the end goal– winning the match.
“It’s not so much what I said but how I said it, which was just calm,” Nygaard said. “To guys I have a pretty good relationship with, I made sure to crack a few jokes and the tension was broke.”
Pepperdine would get the first point of the fifth set with an ace, but Leonard struck back with a quick kill off of the next serve.
The Trojans tied the set at 3-all after a hitting error from the Waves. An ace by Leonard gave the Trojans the lead, 4-3.
Rivera kept the lead in the Trojans’ favor after getting back-to-back kills off of a tool and a tip, 6-4.
Miscommunication on the Trojans’ side tied the score in the set, but Rivera came in clutch with his 22nd kill of the match. A miss-hit by the Waves put the Trojans ahead 8-6.
After the side change, the Waves had another hitting error, causing them to call a timeout as USC led 9-6.
Coming out of the timeout, Pepperdine recorded a quick kill but Benesh came in swinging hard to keep the Trojans’ lead at three, 10-7.
An ace by Benesh pushed the lead to 11-7.
Rivera, as he did all match, came flying in from the right side for the kill, 12-8 USC.
Leonard ripped one from the middle to put the Trojans up 13-9.
A hitting error by Pepperdine moved USC to match point, 14-10.
It was back-and-forth towards the end, but the lead that USC built up in the middle of the set was enough to carry them to the 15-11 set and match victory.
Nygaard said he wants the team to be more mindful of the situations throughout the game.
“They were mindful, they saw the game a bit clearer again,” Nygaard said. “[They] were able to make plays when it mattered.”
Heading into their match against No. 6 Stanford (5-1, 3-1 MPSF), Rivera knows that just because his team got their first win, there’s no stopping them now.
“We’re not going to get our foot off of the gas pedal,” Rivera said. “We’re going to get that record in the positive.”

The Pac-12 Conference announced the official Pac-12 All-Century Men’s Volleyball Team which included four former Trojan greats: setter Dusty Dvorak, middle blocker Bryan Ivie and outside hitters Celso Kalache and Pat Powers.
USC’s nominees, while from different time periods, greatly contributed to the Trojans’ winning traditions as Powers, Dvorak and Kalache were members of the National Championship-winning team in 1980.
One-time All-American Celso Kalache, an outside hitter for the Trojans in 1973, ’74, ’75 and ’77, earned MVP honors for his performance in USC’s 1977 national championship victory. The Brazilian hitter also played for his native country during the 1972 and 1976 Olympics.
Setter Dusty Dvorak attended USC from 1977-1980, receiving All-American honors four times, National Championship MVP honors once in 1980 and took the Trojans to the NCAA Championship three times, earning runner-up honors in 1979.
Fellow outside hitter Pat Powers, a two-time All-American (1979-80), could be considered the most successful Trojan on the All-Century team as he not only won a gold medal for the United States in the 1984 Olympics, but because he also served as the Trojans’ head coach from 1997 to 2001, earning a career-best 26-6 record in the Trojans’ 1999-2000 campaign.
Powers and Dvorak earned their gold medals in the 1984 Olympics and All-American honors.
Though Ivie only obtained one bronze medal during his two stints on the 1992 and 1996 Olympic squads, he currently sits atop the Trojan’s career stats sheet with USC records in career and season kills (2,380, 770) and blocks (661, 199).
Ivie helped USC to three national title appearances, winning in 1988 and 1990, with the Trojans falling in 1991, finishing an impressive 10-year span which saw USC reach the national championship game seven times, winning twice.
Rival UCLA contributed nine of the 16 players nominated to the All-Century team, as well as the Player and Coach of the Century in Karch Kiraly and Al Scates, respectively. Stanford’s Scott Fortune, Erik Shoji and Mike Lambert also received All-Century honors.
One of UCLA’s great players has returned to USC in current head coach Jeff Nygaard. Nygaard was honored as one of four middle blockers named to the All-Century team. Nygaard played at UCLA from 1992-1995. He is in his first year as USC’s head coach.
The Trojans’ next contest will be on Sunday at the Galen Center as USC plays host to Stanford.

USC has an Olympic hopeful in their midst in senior swimmer Kendyl Stewart, who owns four school records, two Pac-12 titles and a world record. Stewart has embraced her passion for swimming with a mentality that has allowed her to keep her sport in perspective while always striving to achieve more.
Swimming, an individual sport, is not always known for the camaraderie surrounding it, but for Stewart, her teammates at USC have shown her what being part of a team is all about.
“Coming to USC has given me a refreshing look at the sport,” Stewart said. “I think it’s so fun to have something where you score points not really for yourself, but for the whole group. To be a team captain for a couple years and begin to understand that my actions are what set the tone for the group has been empowering and motivating.”
Not that Stewart needs any additional motivation. The senior is a record-holder in four events for USC: the 100y fly, the 200y back and two relay records. The accomplishments and accolades do not end there, however.
Stewart is the two-time Pac-12 champion in 100y fly.
She is also an eight-time All-American.
She placed third in her best event the 100y fly in the 2015 NCAA championships while lowering her school record for the event.
Stewart swam in four events for Team USA at the 2015 FINA World Championships which included a silver medal in the 400m mixed medley relay team — a team that also broke the world record during the preliminary rounds.
The only glaring absence on Stewart’s swimming resume is an Olympic appearance. Though Stewart hasn’t yet made the Olympic squad, she is hopeful that this may be her year, and she is no stranger to Olympic qualifying, having already competed for a position on Team USA twice.
“In 2008 I was there, and I was 13, and I was just there for fun. There was no way that was going to happen, but it was the most incredible thing ever to see Olympians and people that I’d been watching on TV,” Stewart said. “In 2012, it was exciting, but it still wasn’t really expected of me, and it wasn’t that positive of an experience because it was this super pressurized and intense thing.”
Stewart is feeling more confident about her chances of making the team this year from both a swimming and mental standpoint.
“I’m definitely in the best position that I’ve been in for the team this time around,” Stewart said. “I just try to keep the pressure out of it and focus on myself and why I like to swim and the personal journey instead of focusing on competitors or the outcome because there’s nothing you can do to control other people.”
Stewart has an attitude about her that is very low-key, and she prides herself on being able to keep the role that swimming plays in her life in perspective.
“If you think about it, it’s just swimming up and down a pool, so to put more stress on it doesn’t really seem worth it,” Stewart said. “Swimming has never been the main stress in my life, where I met my best friends and given me the opportunity to travel the world, and I don’t think that many of my peers have the opportunities that I’ve been given.”
Of the many opportunities swimming has given Stewart, it has taken her to nine countries: Sweden, Germany, Spain, Scotland, Russia, Peru, Australia and Croatia.
Stewart’s favorite international experience was two summers ago in Australia, the year her international swimming career really took off.  She dropped two seconds off her 100y fly time and qualified for, as she put it, her first “big girl” international meet.
For Stewart, though, it wasn’t just a highlight because of what took place in the pool.
“There were four or five of my best friends there, and it happened to be during my birthday, and I was able to stay longer there,” Stewart said. “So it was a perfect alignment of the stars, the people that I was closest to were able to be where I had the meet.”
For Stewart, it is all about having a good time with the people she is closest to and reminding herself that while swimming doesn’t make the world turn. It has brought her a lot of joy and success over the 14 years that she has been swimming. USC has been an instrumental part in her achieving that mindset.
“Since coming to [USC], I’ve broken out on the international scene with USA swimming, and success is a main motivating force,” Stewart said. “With the Olympics coming up and coming back from World Championships, that’s been something that is pretty exciting.”
With Stewart’s final season ready to begin, she has already given thought to what her post-graduation plans will be.
“I hope to just, for a bit, stay here and swim,” Stewart said. “Even if I make the Olympics this summer, I don’t think I’ve reached my full potential as an athlete, I still think there’s a lot to learn. I still like it and I think it can bring me opportunities to travel and hopefully make some money. I hope to play that out as long as I can.”

The start of a new year means the start of new shows to binge-watch. Netflix has recently announced premiere dates for 11 original series, which consist of a mix of old and new shows.
Love
The first of the originals, premiering Feb. 19 and coming from the minds of Judd Apatow and actor Paul Rust, is called Love. It follows the modern perspectives of the hardships of dating from Rust and Gillian Jacobs. This show has enormous potential, seeing as it has the comedic genius of Community star Gillian Jacobs paired up with Judd Apatow, who has written many classic movies and TV shows, including the cult classics and gone-too-soon Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. Apatow excels in making relatable situations shine on the silver screen, and a show about the struggles of trying to date in today’s society is about as relatable as it can get.
Fuller House
Sitcom’s favorite uncles are back starting Feb. 26 in Fuller House. In the spirit of reviving shows from the dead (à la The X-Files and recently, 24), Netflix has decided to bring back one of the most iconic sitcoms ever with this new spin off. Everyone from the original, minus the Olsen twins, will be reprising their roles in the new series. This show aims to please both newcomers who aren’t as familiar with the original show, Full House, and seasoned fans who know every episode by heart. The show follows a newly-widowed D.J. Tanner-Fuller (Candace Cameron Bure) who calls upon Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber) and Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweeton) to help raise her children. Essentially, it’s the same show as before, but less John Stamos.
House of Cards
The Underwoods are back as they try to keep their world around them from crumbling to pieces. Netflix will begin streaming what will likely be the last 13 episodes of the series on March 4, bringing the total to 52, thus completing the full deck of cards. Not much can be said about the fourth season without spoiling it, but it will be interesting to see what’s next for the Underwoods after last season’s cliffhanger.
Flaked
Flaked, premiering March 11, is an original comedy starring Will Arnett, who plays a love guru that falls for the woman that his best friend is pursuing. Arnett has proven that he is a more than capable actor in countless comedic roles, most notably the lovable but idiotic Gob Bluth in Arrested Development. Arnett’s comedic experience should be enough to carry the show, but the potential fate of whether it truly takes off or not rests on the shoulders of the lesser-known actors on the show.
The Ranch
This original comedy series, starring Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson, is about two brothers on their family-owned ranch trying to run a business together. Kutcher doesn’t have the best reputation for his acting, but if Netflix can turn previously Daredevil actor Charlie Cox into a star overnight, anything is possible. Starting in April, 20 episodes, split into two parts with 10 episodes per part, will be available to stream. Who knows, this might be an elaborate April Fool’s Joke, and the show is actually a That ’70s Show reboot.
The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
This hilarious show from the mind of Tina Fey has been picked up for a second season starting April 15. Ellie Kemper plays Kimmy Schmidt, a woman who had unknowingly been held captive underground by a reverend who convinced her and a few other women that the world had ended. After being freed, Kimmy tries to find her way in the world by moving to New York City, making some … interesting friends along the way. People who want a mix of fast-paced humor of 30 Rock with the perfect amount of absurdity of Parks and Recreation will find non-stop laughs with this show.
Marseille
For those who are looking for something more exotic, Marseille, premiering May 5, is a French political drama created by Dan Franck and stars Benoît Magimel and Gérard Depardieu. The series follows Robert Toro (Depardieu), a longtime mayor of Marseille, who must compete against his former apprentice in the upcoming election. If Star Wars has proven anything, it’s that everyone loves a good master over an apprentice story, and House of Cards has shown us just how suspenseful and thrilling a political drama can be.
Grace and Frankie
Grace and Frankie returns on May 6 for more midlife crises. After their husbands (Martin Sheen and Sam Waterson) profess their love for each other and divorce their wives to get married, Grace and Frankie (Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin) become uneasy roommates and try to start life anew. This comedy has a lot of heart and charm, considering it comes from the mind of Marta Kauffman, who also co-created the popular TV show Friends.
Orange Is the New Black
Prison becomes fun again with more episodes of the instant hit Orange Is the New Black releasing on June 15. Like House of Cards, it’s difficult to say too much about this show without spoiling it, but the latest season will be dealing with new prisoners and the drama they bring with them.
Stranger Things
This original drama is premiering July 15 with eight episodes ready to stream. The series entails a mother’s efforts to find her missing son who has simply vanished without a trace. The relatively new writing team of Matt and Ross Duffer will be partnering up with producer Shawn Levy to create a supernatural period piece set in the ’80s.
The Get Down
The last of the originals, premiering Aug. 12, is a musical drama set in Bronx during the creation of punk, hip-hop and disco. This powerful and historical series stars Shameik Moore from the movie Dope and follows a group of teens wondering how they aren’t going under the wild jungle that the Bronx was during this turbulent time. Those who are looking to get to know more about the creation of these groundbreaking genres and the culture surrounding them at the time cannot afford to miss this series, as it looks like this is Netflix’s next big thing.
More information on future Netflix releases can be found online.

Oscar nominations are out and people in the industry are focused on whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio is going to finally win or if the #OscarsSoWhite boycott will affect the awards. But back in the theaters, movies are still rolling out. Normally, post-Oscar eligibility wintertime is where films go to die. Generally, studios release the projects that they have the least amount of faith in because most people aren’t going to the theater anyway. A surprise hit is really the a best case scenario and horror flicks permeate theater screens during this time.
The sad yet predictable truth is that 2016 is not off to a good start in breaking this tradition. January releases have already been a big disappointment (though knowing that nothing good is released anyway makes it less of a disappointment.) Robert De Niro and Zac Efron’s raunchy comedy Dirty Grandpa has already gathered scathing reviews. The promising adaptation of the popular YA dystopian series, The Fifth Wave has critics’ and audiences’ stamp of disapproval after a few days of showing.
But there is good news in all of this. February is not going to let a bad start in January drag it down. A surprising amount of highly anticipated movies are being released next month.
Perhaps the most surprising one in the February bunch is from filmmaking legends Ethan and Joel Coen. A February release is a guaranteed death wish for any film hoping for awards success in the next year, but apparently, the Oscar-winning brothers could care less. Their first directorial film since 2013’s Inside Llewyn Davis is Hail, Caesar! and will be released Feb. 5. Hail, Caesar! is a comedic love letter to postwar filmmaking, with the screening at USC selling out in a matter of minutes. The Coen Brothers have assembled an all-star cast including Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill and George Clooney to take the audience back in time to a 1950s Hollywood film studio.
Opening on the same day is Burr Steers’s Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, based on  the parody novel by Seth Grahame-Smith of the same name. While the idea of mashing up one of the most beloved British love stories from the 19th century with zombies sounds ludicrous, audiences have already embraced it. Several critics praised the novel when first published and it shot to number three on The New York Times bestseller list. Producers had faith in the project because they found reputable filmmakers to bring the story to life. The film will also star Lily James and Douglas Booth.
Marvel is hoping to capitalize on the weaker competition to rule the box office this winter with another comic book hero coming to life. Deadpool is slated to open Feb. 12. This will be another courageous attempt for Ryan Reynolds to make a positive impression in the comic book world since his infamous performance in The Green Lantern. Things are already looking up this time around, though. In 2014, footage was released to the public and it immediately was embraced by fans of the stories, which prompted a faster development for the project. Deadpool will tell the origins of the superhero and a sequel is already in the works to keep the narrative going.
February is exciting for Ben Stiller fans because after 15 years, there will finally be a sequel to Zoolander. Everyone’s favorite model is back in Zoolander 2 along with dynamite stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Kristen Wiig, Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson.
Valentine’s Day will see the opening of How to Be Single starring Dakota Johnson and Rebel Wilson. The NYC-located film follows a group of singletons learning to embrace their relationship status in a world with ever-evolving definitions of love. The film is the result of collaboration between chick-flick writers Dana Fox, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, who adapted Liz Tuccillo’s novel of the same name.
President’s Day brings a much needed film based on the life of track and field legend Jesse Owens entitled Race. The film will star Jason Sudeikis and Stephan James. Owens fought against every barrier to race at the 1936 Olympics.
More information regarding February’s film releases can be found online.

Freshman year, during the initial onslaught of new people, I rarely saved real names in my phone. There was just no way to differentiate Tyler Ps from Tyler Ts, Julies from Julianas, so I saved numbers with context instead. My contacts became searchable by names like Birnkrant, Polo and GE, and remembering people got infinitely easier.
I maintain that naming people for their relation to you rather than their name by itself is a good strategy. It’s a psychological phenomenon that you’ll remember something better if you relate it to yourself (it’s real, look it up). I can’t claim that this is my motivation for referring to my romantic attachments as I do, but it certainly justifies it.
I’ve always struggled with how to refer to the person I’m seeing to other people. The easy answer would be by name, but their name holds significance to me, not necessarily to my friends. Clarifying every time with the cumbersome moniker “the one I’ve been seeing (no not that one, the new one)” is tiring. God forbid a mutual friend shares the same name and the already unwieldy title becomes something like “Michael, high school-boyfriend Michael, not Michael, BK Michael.”
So I took a page from my freshman year handbook and referred to my romantic attachments by their context. The guy who avidly pursued me despite my having made it abundantly clear that I was already monogamously involved became “Overeager Frat Boy.” The aloof and vaguely mystical man I pursued to no avail became “Bad Boy Hippie.” And as high school faded into the distance, the boyfriend I started college with became simply “High School Boyfriend.”
The first person to earn an actual name was someone I dated this past summer. He began simply as “Tinder Boy,” then morphed as I got to know him into things like “Summer Boy” and “The Chef” (he was a chef) as I got to know him. Soon, there were so many permutations that it seemed like I was dating 12 people instead of one, so I broke down and gave him a real name.
But I gave him a real name because I liked him too, not just because the variants got too confusing. He had become a part of my reality to the point that my friends felt like they knew him from the stories I told, and several of them had actually met him. They knew his name and who he was, so there was no more need for contextual pet names.
After we broke up, he was demoted back to relative anonymity. Continuing to use his name felt too familiar since our shared context no longer existed. I still talked about him sometimes, of course — he had occupied a pretty significant chunk of my time — but depending on what I wanted to share, he went back to things like “Summer Boy” and “The Chef.”
Eventually, he was reduced to “OG Tinder Boy,” limiting his identity and significance in my storytelling to a mere distinction between he and my new flame, who I had also met via Tinder. As the new boy now occupied a role more significant to my day-to-day doings, he took over as the reigning “Tinder Boy.”
A week or so ago, my friend asked how it was going with this new Tinder Boy, but used his actual name. It caught me off guard – I wasn’t aware he had reached that level. Of course “Tinder Boy” has been steadily rising through the ranks for some time now, but because I hadn’t initiated the change, I felt disoriented. How could he have suddenly become a real individual without my consent?
The answer is easy. I’ve spent a lot of time on him, and my friends have noticed. But there’s a commitment in a real name, acknowledging that someone isn’t just anyone anymore, and an added sense of risk that comes with it. If there’s never a name, I can just transition from “Tinder Boy” to “Tinder Boy” without really feeling the change — in conversation at least. If he gets to be an individual and not just a concept, it’s harder to sever myself. And I know I’ll have to sever myself at some point — I won’t be in L.A. forever.
But named he is, for better or for worse. For better, probably. My friends can learn new, real names as new, real people come in and out of my life (they’re smart, they go to college). Artificially limiting each mate’s identity to a restricted context isn’t fair to them and isn’t honest with myself. My friends saw my flippancy as a front well before I did, but now that I know, I can go about this more maturely. I can acknowledge intimacy rather than burying it in fake names.

If you’re wondering why political deadlock runs rampant in California, it’s because politicians often find reasons to divide themselves on issues that don’t require debate. There are instances when issues warrant partisan disagreements, but if there’s one proposition that does not, it’s high-speed rail.
Our state is in a dire position in which too much money is being spent on construction and too little natural resources are left to assist the burgeoning needs for completion of the project. It’s why many Democrats who initially supported the rail are rescinding their support, and why many Republicans, environmentalists and government agencies pointed out from the start the absurdity of the project.
In 2008, 53 percent of Californian voters passed a proposition to create the high-speed rail, also known as the bullet train. The California High Speed Rail Authority was granted the $10 billion bond for “specific construction projects with private and public matching funds required.” At the time, the idea for the creation of the high-speed rail was met with adequate concern, but not enough to generate any significant oversight. Costs for the project were projected to be around $33 billion, which is now less than half of the current estimate.
But since then, priorities in California have shifted. Seven years later and the state is facing a severe drought, with extreme water shortages and rain shortfalls for several counties, specifically in the Central Valley. In lieu of these events, Gov. Jerry Brown has called for even more stringent environmental policy — including additional regulations, such as Assembly Bill 52, in the California Environmental Quality Act last year.
Brown’s desire to create stringent environmental policy, however, now has constituents wondering why he would do so when he fails to maintain these requirements for his own widely supported project: HSR.
A Golden State poll created by the Hoover Institution recently found that 53 percent of California voters would vote in favor of a bill that required plans to halt HSR in its entirety and to use rollover funds for water-storage projects and the like. Two of the 12 construction sites with technical memorandums refer to outdated facts and figures. When these memos were created, the water shortage was not the main crisis facing California. But because those figures passed the water conservation policy then, they are not legally required to reassess the sites for construction.
Even more concerning is that what initially persuaded voters — funds from private investors and protection of taxpayer interests — has not materialized. The rapid increase of funds for a large project has dissuaded private investors from contributing and brought serious concern over the lack of oversight this project has received due to pushback from Brown and members of his party.
The bullet train, separated into 12 different sections for construction, promised to complete the Burbank to Merced station by 2022. However, there are several literal roadblocks halting construction for this initial operating segment, including the creation of 36 miles of tunneling through “geologically complex” mountains, implementation of electrical lines and maintenance facilities.
“Crews will have to cross the tectonic boundary that separates the North American and Pacific plates, boring through a jumble of fractured rock formations and a maze of earthquake faults, some of which are not mapped,” the Los Angeles Times said. “It will be the most ambitious tunneling project in the nation’s history.”
And, the L.A. Times is right — it is an overly ambitious project and at this rate, it’s likely that the lack of oversight toward the beginning of the project has directly resulted in burgeoning costs for maintenance and construction of the sites. It’s what keeps state counties, environmentalists, government oversight agencies and legislators up at night. Over the past few years, seven lawsuits have been filed for complaint over the high-speed rail and its violation of CEQA. But several democrats and Gov. Brown’s support for the bullet train has successfully overruled these suits with the help of federal attorneys who claim that the High-Speed Rail authority is only required to follow federal guidelines.
So far, Kern County and and Kings County, in conjunction with other groups, have both filed appeals to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in response to Federal Transportation agreeing that because CEQA was “preempted by federal law.”
The California Senate Transportation Committee is set to conduct legislative oversight hearings on the high-speed rail to discuss heightened costs, estimated time of completion and management.
Sen. James Beall Jr. will lead the hearings and a 2016 business plan that will “lay out the state’s latest vision for how it will fund, build and eventually operate the 22-mph trains,” according to the L.A. Times.
Do California a favor, and help put a stop to the high-speed rail.
Spot on.

Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
Professor George Sanchez, the Vice Dean of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives for Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, compiled a selective timeline documenting the history of racism at USC at the diversity forum last Wednesday. Perhaps the most jarring of his findings was about the man the Von KleinSmid Center is named after: chancellor for life, possible white supremacist sympathizer and former USC president Rufus B. Von KleinSmid. As USC continues to memorialize Von KleinSmid by granting him the namesake of a humanities building and library, USC literally houses structural racism and further institutionalizes the production of a campus climate that is inherently intolerant. The lack of transparency on Von KleinSmid aside, it is important to consider what this means to students of color on campus — their rights to safety, inclusion and basic dignities are in the shadow of a man whose legacy was built on keeping people like them outside of the Walls of Troy. Above all else, USC needs to remove Von KleinSmid’s name from all buildings as well as rid the plaza of his bust and its accompanying eulogy.
The University must shed light on its own history and acknowledge that much of its foundation was built on the backs of discrimination, racism and xenophobia. According to Dr. Sanchez’s timeline, in 1928 Von KleinSmid became the founding member of a leading eugenics organization called the Human Betterment Foundation. In 1945, he refused to send transcripts to colleges enrolling Japanese-American citizens who were released from internment camps. Not only did he work to prevent these students from getting an education, but he also sent them to the camps in 1942, according to the same source. During his presidency in 1946, the Jewish Journal reports, a cross burning took place on the lawn of a Jewish fraternity house. Also according to the same source, admissions at this time had an informal quota system, which allegedly allowed one Jew to attend the University per year.
Condemning the act of revisionism renders the purpose behind academia futile — if an institution of higher education intends to hold onto a legacy as antiquated and sullied as Von KleinSmid’s, then what can be said about that very same institution’s dedication to innovation, critical theory and research? Much of the criticism of renaming buildings defends racist figureheads and argues that purging a school of its history is useless. What needs to be understood is that this is not an issue of a few students disliking USC’s history or simply a representation of what the norm was at that time; calls to rename buildings are, however, an active movement to remove racism from a pedestal and a process in which history is accurately represented — not slanted — by the narratives of exceptionalism commonplace in American universities.
On the topic of Von KleinSmid, to which the University “affectionately” refers to as “Dr. Von” on its website, USC has said that “his presidency left a remarkable legacy: a University transformed from a modest local denominational institution with a scattering of schools and facilities to a consolidated secular institution with 24 schools and colleges, 16 buildings and national accreditation and standing.” It is clear that the nature of the University’s veneration of Von KleinSmid has more to do with the material gains accounted for under his presidency than his role as the leader of intellectuals.
Student-led campaigns such as “I, Too, Am USC” note the prevalence of discrimination and the potency of racism on campus robbing students of color of their ability to identify as Trojans. The need for such a campaign calls into question: What is a greater priority to the administration — our identity as a progressive and inclusive campus in today’s terms or our history of bigoted male leaders? The answer to this question depends on who is truly the face of USC. To further contextualize this, Von KleinSmid is a dark symbol of the University in the same way that the confederate flag is a dark symbol of America; however, today it is next to obscene to wave a Confederate flag in much of America because of what it represents and what is refers to historically — slavery. The same can be said for VKC.
It is impossible to revere a man for discrimination, racism and xenophobia while also respecting the space of international students, students from immigrant families and students of color. In doing so, USC ensures that the oppression and degradation of students of color is certainly included — but the school’s respect for students who face racism is not.

Around 1,400 students descended upon the University of Pennsylvania this past weekend to participate in PennApps, a student-run college hackathon at the nation’s first university.
For 36 hours straight, teams worked on programming new mobile apps, websites or hardware that they hoped would impress their peers and, perhaps more importantly, the judges who awarded cash and gadget prizes.
This isn’t the first time this has happened. PennApps has been hosting biannual hackathons (think marathon + hacking) since 2009. However, this was my first hackathon and I was excited to experience what many of my peers have spoken so highly about.

The Schedule
PennApps kicked off Friday. From noon until the evening, hackers steadily trickled into the Penn Engineering Quad where check-in was held. Most hackers came in groups of three or four — old friends who had signed up together or new friends who had met on flights to Philadelphia and discovered their shared destination. After check-in, many teams rushed to drop off their gear and claim workspaces. I asked around about what made a good workspace and received a wide variety of answers. While a few cited quiet nooks where they wouldn’t be distracted, others told me they preferred hallways where everyone could see each other’s projects and help out. One veteran hacker told me he needed a large classroom where his team could fit multiple air mattresses for their occasional naps.
I didn’t fully grasp how large the event was until the evening’s opening ceremony where the group poured into a massive auditorium and filled every seat. Guest speakers from Y Combinator and Make School welcomed the audience before the PennApps sponsors presented their APIs — unique company-specific back-end interfaces that allow developers to build other software applications.

That ceremony would be the last I would see of the full group for a while as everyone quickly scattered after its conclusion.

The People
I, admittedly, did see many instances of the stereotypical “brogrammer,” but I also met many people who broke the stereotype. It was clear that PennApps really made an effort to invite those from a variety of backgrounds and experience levels. Ages ranged from 15-year-old high school students to graduate students who were at the age where it would be rude to ask. There was also an apparent geographic diversity. Many people were shocked to hear that PennApps had flown me in from California. They were even more shocked to meet the hackers from Bangladesh and Berlin.

The Winning Hack
The team that took home the grand prize of Oculus Rifts, smart watches and the latest video game consoles were the creators of RAMEAR, a combination transmitter and receiver, that wirelessly “listens” to RAM to transmit messages. RAMEAR was built by a group that joined forces after meeting through the PennApps Facebook group and consisted of one Penn physics Ph.D. candidate, one college senior from Turkey and two friends from Imperial College London.

My Verdict
Attending PennApps was way outside my comfort zone and I’m glad I went, but I think it’ll be a while until I attend another hackathon. Many compare attending a hackathon to being at a “technological Woodstock” and I found that somewhat true, hygiene included. Showers were canceled the first night which may have spurred an early meltdown had I not, luckily, been staying with a friend who attends Penn. Despite the organizers’ genuine efforts for inclusivity, I did feel uncomfortable with my non-technical background when I had brushes with “programmer elitism.” However, throughout the weekend, I attended multiple workshops and learned concepts more quickly than I would have in a classroom setting. Seeing what other hackers were building was inspiring, to say the least.
“Come join us to learn something new, build something novel and start something from scratch,” said the PennApps website. PennApps, like many of the products built this weekend, had its fair share of glitches, but ultimately delivered.
