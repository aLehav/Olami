The late USC All-American and NFL All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Jan. 31. Seau was the only first-time eligible candidate elected into the class of 2015. His induction ceremonies will be held on Aug. 7 through Aug. 9 in Canton, Ohio. He was represented by his sons in the announcement ceremonies.
Seau is among a 2015 class that includes Jerome Bettis, Charles Haley, Tim Brown, Will Shields, Mick Tingelhoff, Ron Wolf and Bill Polian.
The former Trojan linebacker was a letterman in 1988 and 1989, and earned All-American first team and Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1989. During his tenure at USC, the Trojans went 19-4-1 and made two Rose Bowl appearances. He made 107 tackles while donning cardinal and gold, including 33 for a loss. He was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009.
With Seau’s induction, USC now has 12 Pro Football Hall of Famers. Seau will join the ranks of fellow Trojans Marcus Allen, Red Badgro, Frank Gifford, Ronnie Lott, Bruce Matthews, Ron Mix, Anthony Munoz, O.J. Simpson, Lynn Swann, Willie Wood and Ron Yary.
Seau was drafted fifth overall in the 1990 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers and played 20 years in the league. Seau is the only defender in the history of the NFL to play 20 years in the league. He left the Chargers after the 2002 season and played for the Miami Dolphins (2003-2005) and the New England Patriots               (2006-2009).
Seau was selected to 12 Pro Bowl teams, was an All-Pro eight times and appeared in Super Bowls XXIX and XLII. Seau helped the Chargers reach their sole Super Bowl in 1994, resulting in a loss to the 49ers. At the conclusion of his NFL career, Seau had recorded 1,849 tackles with 56.5 sacks and 18 interceptions.
Seau’s legacy ended tragically with his suicide on May 2, 2012, at age 43. Following his death, tests done on his brain revealed that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease linked to frequent head trauma common in the NFL, and can cause insomnia and depression, both of which plagued Seau.
Aside from his performance on the field, Seau is remembered for his commitment to community service through the Junior Seau Foundation, which helps at-risk children in the San Diego area.

With National Signing Day quickly approaching for the USC football program, there are still several highly rated prospects that are undecided. Just a few days before Signing Day, USC already has 20 committed recruits and according to Rivals.com, boasts the second-best recruiting class behind Alabama. The main recruit left for the Trojans to secure is five-star cornerback Iman Marshall.
Marshall is a 6-foot-1, 190-pound from Long Beach Poly, who had a tremendous senior season with 85 total tackles and 16 pass break-ups. He even played a little offense, accumulating 315 yards and eight touchdowns. In his final season, Marshall led the Jackrabbits to an 11-2 record but they ultimately lost to St. John Bosco in the CIF semifinals.
Even though Marshall’s high school career ended against St. John Bosco, he received an invitation to play in the Under Armour All-America Game where he shone. He played in all aspects of the Under Armour game: offense, defense and special teams. Marshall had five tackles overall while playing excellent pass coverage on the top wide receiver recruits in the country.
Even new USC commit Ronald Jones II, who is the top running back in the country, said that Marshall was the most impressive USC target who played in the Under Armour game.
What makes Marshall such a highly touted prospect is his size and his instincts on the outside. He is a large corner who can use his strength to jam receivers as well as push them off their routes. Marshall can even quickly recover from a mistake and still make a play on the ball. He can be compared to former USC cornerback and safety Josh Shaw, in that he has the size of a safety but the speed and instincts of a cornerback.
Many teams are now looking for bigger, faster receivers, and in this way Marshall stands out. He is a player that can be plugged in and play right away. With his skill set, he could be one of the best cornerbacks to ever come through USC.
Last season, USC struggled with the lack of depth at the cornerback position, especially with the loss of Shaw early on. Several times last season, players in the secondary had to play before they were ready due to injuries. Starting cornerbacks freshman Adoree’ Jackson, junior Kevon Seymour and redshirt freshman Chris Hawkins are all returning and Marshall could fit right into the mix.
One edge that USC has over its rivals is that the Trojans have Marshall’s old counterpart in freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith. Smith played at Long Beach Poly with Marshall and he also was the opposite corner with Marshall. No doubt, Smith will be telling Marshall what a great place USC is and how great this Trojan football team can be.
So far Marshall has narrowed down his top choices to USC, UCLA, Notre Dame, LSU and Michigan. He will make his college decision on Feb. 4, and many analysts believe that Marshall will follow the Long Beach Poly pipeline and join the Trojans in the fall. But until then, the USC coaching staff will have to anxiously await his    decision.
Marshall has until National Signing Day on Feb. 4 to reveal which collegiate team he will play for.

A last minute come back effort would not help the USC women’s basketball team defeat Oregon. It would be the 3-pointers and free throws that helped the Ducks gain their third Pac-12 win on Monday evening. The low-scoring game ended in a loss for the Women of Troy, 63-57.
Sophomore guard Courtney Jaco lead in scoring with 14 points and two steals. Senior forward Kaneisha Horn scored 10 and had eight rebounds.
“Regardless of the score, we’ve got to learn how to come out and compete, whether we’re up or we’re down,” redshirt sophomore Jordan Adams said.
The game started in an evenly yoked battle, the Ducks (10-11, 3-7 Pac-12) and the Women of Troy        (11-10, 3-7 Pac 12) traded the lead early in the first half. Ten minutes into the first half, both teams were tied at 15 points, neither could make a shot for three minutes in regulation.
It would be a jumper from Adams that would give USC the lead. Then the Women of Troy went on a run offensively for the rest of the half and did not allow the Ducks to see a lead.
USC played defensively and  grabbed a couple of steals to secure their lead. Horn was reliable at the free-throw line and executed a block against Jillian Alleyne. Senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama and sophomore guard Brianna Barrett contributed to the early lead for USC. The Women of Troy had a 5-point lead with two minutes left in regulation in the first half. The Ducks responded with a 3-pointer, the last score for both teams for the half, 23-25 for the Women of Troy.
The game stayed close at the beginning of the second half. The Ducks stayed alive through shots from behind the arc, but the Women of Troy would not allow them to enjoy a lead long. Both teams reached a tie at 31 points that lasted for two minutes. The game continued to stay gridlocked; as one team earned a field goal, the other team would respond at the same volume.
“They had a good game plan,” Jaco said. “They packed it in, so we had to shoot.”
With 6:50 left in regulation, the Ducks found a lead opportunity with a single free throw. The Women of Troy lost the lead and would never get it back. USC went scoreless for three minutes while the Ducks took flight offensively.
USC had a burst of energy in the last minute of the game with 3-pointers from Vaioletama and Jaco, but their efforts could not beat the Ducks in the long run.
The Women of Troy will return home to face Utah on Friday, Feb. 6 at 7 p.m. in the Galen Center.

When it comes to women’s sand volleyball, there aren’t as many players as legendary as Misty May-Treanor, who served as the volunteer assistant coach for USC’s sand volleyball program last year. This season, she’s staying home to take care of her baby girl, but there’s no need to worry for the program because of its new volunteer assistant coach for this season: two-time Olympian Dain Blanton.
Head coach Anna Collier announced the exciting news for the program.
“Words can’t describe just how fortunate we are to have another gold medalist come aboard,” Collier commented. “We look forward to everything he has to share and teach our team about his experience.”
Blanton definitely knows a thing or two about winning. In the 2000 Sydney Games, he won gold in beach volleyball with partner Eric Fonoimoana. In 2004, he competed in the Athens Games with Jeff Nygaard, current assistant coach for undefeated USC men’s volleyball, making Blanton the first two-time male beach volleyball Olympian for Team USA.
Before his Olympic success, Blanton, as a sophomore, had a key role in Pepperdine’s 1992 NCAA championship; he was also an All-American for the Waves. On the professional beach circuit, he achieved a plethora of accolades. Winning the 1997 AVP Hermosa Grand Slam made him the first male                        African-American to win a major beach volleyball event. He earned a bronze medal with Kent Steffes in the 1997 Beach Volleyball World Championships.
In his successful pro career, Blanton clinched nine AVP crowns (four with Nygaard), two FIVB titles and 11 beach tournaments. In 2003, Blanton captured the title of AVP’s Best Offensive Player and he and Nygaard were crowned the AVP Team of the Year. Only a few other players can say that they’ve obtained as many championships — college, Olympics or professionally — as Blanton. His nearly unmatched success will benefit the Women of Troy immensely.
Off the sand, Blanton also covers beach volleyball, NBA, MLB and college basketball and football as a TV sports broadcaster for networks such as ESPN, NBC, ABC, FOX Sports Net, Universal Sports Network and Pac-12 Networks.
Not only is Blanton “a force to be reckoned with on the court,” but also he is an inspiring motivational speaker and mentor to students through GettingToGold — a nonprofit that he founded. In 1997, he created Dain’s Day at the Beach, a charity that allows urban youth to play beach volleyball.
To say that Blanton is a success would be an understatement. As a coach at USC, he will no doubt share his expertise and methods to achieve success with the team. He will bring his winning mindset and intensify the team’s already victorious Trojan spirit and work ethic.
Compounding the success that USC’s powerhouse program has obtained since its founding in 2012 (third place finishes nationally in 2013 and 2014, two national championship pairs in 2013 and 2014), having Blanton as a coach will continue to grow the program and solidify it as a top program for many years to come.

Now that I have finally picked my jaw up off the floor, I can begin to write about what I just witnessed in Super Bowl XLIX. As close as the game was, I’m still disappointed. Not because I am a Seahawks fan or because I hate the Patriots. In fact, I didn’t really have a rooting interest at all.
I think the game ended the way everyone expected it to, with the go-ahead score in the final minutes. There were lead changes and momentum shifts throughout the entire game.
The Patriots seemed to control the first half so much that my friend was convinced that Deflategate was planned as a coverup to hide Spygate part two. The Patriots took the lead with a touchdown but gave Russell Wilson two minutes to score, something he did in 29 seconds to end the first half.
Then came the second half that had the Patriots at a 10-point deficit. The defending champions had Tom Brady on the ropes and forced him into another costly interception.
It looked like the Seahawks had it in the bag after an incredible juggling catch by Jermaine Kearse. All the Hawks had to do was hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch on the 1-yard line and let “Beast Mode” end the game, but instead Wilson threw a game-ending interception.
And that is why I think the Seattle offensive coordinator is the real MVP. Brady might be the official Super Bowl XLIX MVP, but he won by default. Brady didn’t really do anything important except throw two interceptions. Gronkowski had an important touchdown reception, but I still wouldn’t call it MVP status.
Wilson was the better quarterback during the game, but gave up Seattle’s only turnover with the costly interception. Lynch and Richard Sherman were both quiet, too, and if I had to pick an MVP I would choose Chris Matthews, who didn’t have a single catch all season except for his four catches for 109 yards in the Super Bowl. The undrafted 25-year-old is in his first season in the NFL and was just signed off of Seattle’s practice squad in December. His first catch came in the second quarter and was Wilson’s first completion of the night, helping to get Seattle’s offense in motion.
With that said, I don’t think I would’ve been totally satisfied if the Seahawks had won, either. I consider them lucky to even be playing for a Super Bowl after a pretty lucky win over Green Bay. Couple that with the fact that they almost won on Kearse’s miraculous juggling reception, and I was having a hard time getting over how lucky the Seahawks were.
But I am not convinced that the Patriots deserved to win either. With Deflategate now the second cheating scandal during Brady and Belichick’s reign, I question the Pats’ morals and integrity, and basically every game they’ve ever won. I was completely impartial to Deflategate until I saw Brady’s interview with Bob Costas in which his answers came across as evasive and calculated. To be fair, though, I also know that Pete Carroll might not even be the Seattle head coach right now if he hadn’t been caught in a scandal of his own here at USC.
Moreover, I don’t like that Brady won the Super Bowl and the MVP on a defensive play. I don’t think the Patriots won so much as Seattle simply failed to finish.
And finally, the last straw was the commercials. If I was going to be this dissatisfied with the outcome of the game, I wish I could have at least found some consolation in the commercials. I can count on one hand the number of commercials I found amusing.

The Trojan Scholars Society launched the Trojan Scholars Connection, an online tool that aims to bring the members of the USC scholarship community together, last week.
The Trojan Scholars Society is the association of Presidential, Trustee, Stamps and Mork scholars at USC and currently includes more than 2,000 students. The purpose of the organization is to serve students who have received these merit scholarships.
TSS freshman representatives Kyle Pham and Spencer Wix had the idea to create the Scholar Connection program. According to Pham and Wix, their idea for the program originated during their first semester at USC.
The website’s goal is to allow scholars to share their various ideas online so they can connect with other talented students who could potentially help develop them. It also allows students to browse for other students’ ideas that match their passions so they can help fellow Trojans.
Pham explained that he came up with the idea when he noticed the vast array of students who have the potential to network with one another.
“I realized there is a huge population of brilliant individuals at USC and there should be an easy way for them to network with each other,” Pham said.
Wix also expressed how in the past he would have a great idea in mind, but would lack feasible plans to make them a reality. Thus, Wix and Pham created Scholar Connection to help alleviate this issue. Despite some logistical complications, they managed to successfully develop their project.
Armineh Dereghishian, assistant director at the USC Office of Academic and International Fellowships and an adviser to the TSS, explained that Pham and Wix played a large role in executing the implementing of the program.
Pham and Wix would talk on a weekly basis, map out the ideas and go to executive meetings to share their progress.
“Pham and Wix are the masterminds behind this and that they are a great representation of the Scholars Society,” Dereghisian said. “The launch event was very well attended; there was a lot of positive energy. We already have two ideas up on the website, which is really good, considering it launched just last Thursday.”
Gabriella Visani, a freshman majoring in occupational therapy, is hoping to write a book about people with special needs.  Visani explained that she heard about Scholar Connection through Pham, who helped connect her with other students who have resources that can help her solidify her project.
“Anyone who is interested or has any ideas about how to start the project [should join],” Visani said.
Joseph Gaebler, a freshman majoring in business administration, discussed his idea to add a financial literacy group for students on the Scholar Connection website. Gaebler explained that he wanted to help students learn about managing their money, but missed the deadline to pitch the club to the university. When Pham told him about their website, he posted his idea online.
“[Pham] got me started and helped me find similar-minded people and think about [these] ideas and then the actual event was great for getting the word out there, especially for Trojan Scholars Society,” Gaebler said. “It is a significant part of the campus and the word got out for a lot of people. A lot of it is just publicity; the event was connecting people.”
Kathleen Siswanto, president of the Trojan Scholar Society, discussed how the project might be of great use to USC students.
“I have very high hopes for this project,” Siswanto said. “This has the potential to bring value to the USC community as a whole.”
Though she is graduating this May, she hopes to keep in touch with her fellow scholars and see the project develop into something greater.  One of her goals for this semester is to have an involvement fair where people can showcase their ideas.
“I want to see the mini involvement fair happen before the end of the school year,” Siswanto said. “Something like this would be really good so that people could showcase to others, I think that would be a great idea of connecting people and getting great ideas to happen on campus.”

Forty MBA student delegates from the Marshall School of Business were among the first Americans to travel to areas in Cuba since the embargo was lifted.
The trip, which was led by Dr. Carl Voigt, professor of clinical management and organization at Marshall,  was part of a 13-day program to teach students about the structure of a planned economy.
Ten days before the delegates departed, President Barack Obama released a statement that he intended to normalize relations with Cuba, putting an end to an embargo that has lasted more than 50 years, which the president described as “an outdated approach.”
Joanna Rapadas, a graduate student studying business administration, said she felt a tangible sense of optimism from the people in Cuba when she visited.
“There’s this sense of hope down there,” Rapadas said. “They were telling us this story about how on Dec. 17, when [Obama] made that announcement, that people were out in the streets cheering for Obama.”
The group of MBA students spent the majority of the 13-day trip meeting with local businesses throughout Havana to gain a sense of the inner workings of a planned economy.
Rapadas said one of the most memorable presentations of the trip was centered on Cuba’s biotechnology industry. The presentation included a discussion with medical students and doctors, including various types of research they had been working on.
Rapadas also discussed obstacles the doctors faced in terms of disseminating the medicine and research they have produced because of strict trade sanctions placed on the nation. The delegates were all given documentation about how investments in Cuba’s biotech industry could be made, as well as how prospective investors could start businesses in the country.
“One of the things that the doctor who did the presentation said to us was that we were the first delegation from Marshall to ever receive this documentation,” Rapadas said. “The reason being that up until President Obama’s announcement it had not made sense to, given the fact that the two countries were restricted from doing business together. To be able to get that information from him was, I mean, extremely memorable to say the least.”

Scott Zabielski, a graduate of the School of Cinematic Arts, won first place in the Doritos “Crash the Super Bowl” contest on Sunday with a commercial he directed called, “Middle Seat,” which aired during the Super Bowl. His commercial won him $1 million and a job at Universal Pictures.
The 30-second commercial features a man who lands the aisle seat on an airplane with no one sitting in the middle seat. As new passengers are boarding the plane, he exhausts a number of impolite behaviors — crippling his toenails, coughing profusely and playing the flute — to deter passengers from sitting beside him.
The man eventually sees an attractive woman — played by a Trojan alumna — walk down the aisle. He smiles at her while holding up a bag of Doritos in an effort to get her to take the seat, which she does. Seconds later, he finds out she is carrying a crying baby, played by Zabielski’s son.
Zabielski explained that he came up with the commercial’s storyline with the goal of creating jokes that were relatable to all of his viewers.
“I kind of think that the best humor is the type where people can relate to it,” Zabielski said. “They can look at something and say, ‘That’s funny because it’s true.’ I think we’ve all been in that situation, if you’ve ever flown in an airplane, where you have that seat open next to you and you see people coming down the aisle towards you and you’re trying to think of anything you can to keep that seat empty. I kind of wanted to play with the idea that if you were going to make a total fool of yourself and do outrageous things, what would you do to keep the seat empty.”
Zabielski was also an executive producer on the comedy television show Tosh.O. His commercial had a $2,000 budget, though he only decided to move forward with the project two weeks before the submission deadline.
“I have always wanted to direct commercials, and I’ve been working in TV for the last several years,” Zabielski said. “I basically get into commercials from TV. You have to do a special commercial to prove that you can do something in 30 seconds instead of what I do on my show which can be three or four minutes. So, I realized that the Doritos contest deadline was coming up, and I decided to make the spec commercial a Doritos commercial. I kind of entered on a whim.”
Zabielski worked on the commercial with his wife, Genevieve Younce Zabielski. She was instrumental to the success of the commercial as she helped with production and ran the social media campaigns.
The contest, which had more than 4,900 entries, had two winners: a grand prize winner chosen by the public via online voting and a runner-up chosen by Doritos.
Zabielski did not find out that he had won the contest until it aired during the Super Bowl. After the game, he was presented with his prize in a Super Bowl suite alongside his family and friends.
Zabielski said that he does not have details on his new position at Universal Pictures yet, but he hopes that the new job will allow him to further his career.
The 2011 winners of the Doritos “Crash the Super Bowl” contest, J.R. Burningham and Tess Ortbals, were also USC graduates who won with their commercial, “Pug Attack.”

USC officials have spoken with an NFL franchise about the possibility of a new Los Angeles-based team playing at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum while a new football stadium is being built, according to an NBC News.
Since January, experts have speculated that the St. Louis Rams would be leasing the Coliseum. The Rams moved from Southern California to St. Louis at the end of 1994 season.
Rams owner Stan Kroenke,has been lobbying for a new stadium to be built for the team in St. Louis, which he hopes will receive public financing, but he has been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement.
According to NBC News, Athletic Director Pat Haden said that if an NFL team were to move to Southern California, the university would like that team to make the Coliseum its temporary home.
“It doesn’t make much difference if they [NFL] come in 2015 or 2016 in terms of our renovation of the Coliseum because we have a lot of work to do before we start that,” Haden said. “If they come in 2016, great.”
In 2013, USC and the Coliseum entered into a 98-year lease agreement, which allows the school to operate and renovate the landmark structure.
“Our current lease allows for an NFL team to play in the Coliseum temporarily. If we were to receive a proposal, we would review it,” said Thomas Sayles, the senior vice president of university relations, in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Jonny Farasat, a sophomore majoring in real estate development, noted how Los Angeles is going to change should an NFL team play at the Coliseum.
“I think it would attract a lot of people, more traffic and it’ll bring the city to life. I think it would be a good idea to lease the Coliseum,” Farasat said.  “I think it can have an effect on the USC football schedule but I think if people come together they can coordinate times where there won’t be interruptions.”
George Andrews, a senior majoring in chemistry and accounting, discussed the impact of traffic around the university.
“The first word that comes to mind is congestion. I think of the traffic after living here for about 22 years,” Andrews said. “I immediately think about how bad the traffic is going to be. I think until the city of Los Angeles decides to improve its transportation system, they should not bring another football team or another event downtown where it provides a lot of congestion for people that are trying to commute to work.”

I started my creative essay for my application to the film school here at USC with one line: “I come from a long line of powerful women.”
I went on to assert that my lineage made me into the young woman I am today: driven, strong and ready to take the film world by storm, regardless of the ratio of men to women in Hollywood.
At the time of writing that essay, I hadn’t yet been introduced to the word “feminism.” At least, not in the way I would become acquainted with it later. Back then, I shied away from the F-word, quick to disassociate myself from a group that I perceived as radical, worried it was too polarizing a term for a girl on the brink of defining who she was.
Of course, almost two years of college now under my belt (and a conference paper on feminism in Ridley Scott’s 1991 film Thelma & Louise presented last spring), I now have a different perspective. But back then, I knew simply that the women in my family were strong and powerful, and I would be, too, no question. I didn’t need to label myself a “feminist” for that to be true.
So, when actress Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting (most notable for her role as Penny on The Big Bang Theory) recently responded “Is it bad if I say no?” after Redbook magazine asked if she was a feminist, I understood. Cuoco went on to add: “I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that’s because I’ve never really faced inequality.” Focusing on the foundations of her argument — that she “never … faced inequality” — it’s easy to see why. A quick glance at either her IMDb or Wikipedia page shows that Cuoco has had fairly steady work since 1992, at the tender age of 7 years old. Furthermore, she has never made less money than any of her Big Bang co-stars, despite the fact that the rest of the cast has been primarily composed of men since the show’s inception.
For a woman who has been able to support herself with an equal salary compared to the other men in her “office” for the past seven years, the idea of feminism might seem antiquated or simply non-applicable, as she points out. In the following weeks after Cuoco’s interview was published, outrage flew from every direction, requiring Cuoco to apologize for her statements. The outrage, I found, was a bit extreme; however, the response not only helped Cuoco better understand the actual definition of “feminism” but it also sparked a dialogue as Cuoco went on her subsequent “Apology Tour.” Cuoco’s faux pas and celebrity status provided an avenue by which readers and viewers had a chance to think about and explore definitions of feminism for themselves, proving that — beyond academic definitions and conference papers at liberal institutions — the media is a very effective platform to relate and share thoughts, ideas and information.
Emma Watson’s #HeforShe campaign is the best example of this medium being put to good use. #HeForShe is labeled as “a solidarity movement for gender equality” on their website, calling men to the force and asking them to speak out for their female counterparts. The campaign is made possible by Watson’s star status, so created by the Harry Potter franchise. When she launched #HeforShe, she asked countless other celebrities to join in on Twitter, furthering the movement and its exposure to the millions. It is important to note, however, that nowhere on the #HeForShe website do they advertise “feminism” as its cause or part of its manifesto; they simply tout “gender equality” as their initiative, which raises an important question: when discussing equality, should the F-word be left out of the picture?
Even if Cuoco’s blunder allowed for others to be educated, it still raises quite a few hairs when mentioned to those who don’t understand its exact definition. When The Hollywood Reporter recently asked cinema legend Meryl Streep what the biggest lesson she’s learned in her career was, she simply said: “Ask other people what they make. Because the men usually make more than you do. And it’s good to know. You’re not allowed to ask. But it’s good to ask.” She doesn’t preach feminism, but she clearly states the need to assert oneself as a woman.
From here on out, this column will continue to explore not only one of my first loves, film, but also the multi-faceted relationship it has with a considered “minority” within the industry: women. I will explore those trends, developments and projects that are either written, produced, created by or affect women. This is all opinion, but it is also a dialogue; feel free to respond by emailing schedeen@usc.edu.

Los Angeles can proudly say it has some of the best Mexican food north of the border. While the uninitiated think Mexican cuisine stops at burritos, tacos and El Torito’s menu, L.A. patrons and residents know better. Angelenos value authenticity and flavor over hype.
Flautas brings a new aspect of Mexican food to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. The menu is derivative of the restaurant’s name; “flautas” means “flutes”  in Spanish which describes the shape of the long, rolled-up fried tacos served with a unique sauce on top and varying vegetables. The dish, and the manner in which Flautas serves it, is traditional in many parts of Mexico.
Located within the mall’s food court, Flautas’ design is sleek and simple, with muted greys and blacks as the color scheme — a stark contrast to the loud and obnoxious displays of other fast-food establishments. The menu contains only 14 items with a clear picture of the food allowing the customer to know exactly what they are ordering. It is clear that Flautas hopes to be an option for those looking for a satisfying and quick Mexican meal.
And yet it fails to deliver.
Guests are limited to nine flautas from which to choose. They range from shrimp to beef; there is also a vegetarian option. Each flauta has its own kind of sauce and toppings, but they come at a steep price. A single flauta is $2.99, while a triple is $7.49. The presentation of the food is impressive, almost artsy. The flautas are not smothered in sauce or condiments here. Rather, a sauce is lightly poured over the flautas and then sliced vegetables are delicately placed on top with a sprinkling of crumbled cotija cheese.
For the price being paid, the food is expected to not look as if it was carelessly thrown together (check). It should also taste good — here is where Flautas fails. Flavorful food is a must for any Mexican restaurant. It’s almost a religious experience when you bite into a food that sets your taste buds on fire. Flautas lacks flavor in its food, and the weakest link is the meats, specifically the shrimp, pork and beef flautas as well as Toto-Chips Deluxe -— their version of nachos, topped with shredded meat, guacamole, beans and jalapenos.
The meats were flavorless and dry. The pork and beef had the texture of jerky. The shrimp was crumbled up and slightly burned. In fact, the shrimp flauta itself was over-fried and harder than it should be. However, the chipotle sauce was amazing and worth a trip to ask what the recipe for it is. The tortilla-to-meat ratio was off-putting, and felt like eating a large chunk of fried tortilla.
The nachos aesthetically looked delicious. There seemed to be enough on them to warrant a tasty item. Unfortunately, everything was bland. There was hardly anything worth noting, except that people accustomed to Chipotle’s guacamole or who have avocado, lime and salt at home will be insulted by what is on the nachos. The horchatas bought to wash everything down were also unremarkable — there are much better ones found in the Fashion District in Downtown.
But where was the salsa? Usually, a spicy salsa can save an otherwise flat meal, but there was none offered at Flautas. Oh yes, there was an option to add chips and salsa for another $2. Maybe El Pollo Loco and their endless salsa bar have spoiled expectations. Maybe, but maybe not. It was also surprising to have rice missing from the entire menu. Requests to have the beans on the nachos replaced with rice before we knew there wasn’t any was shot down. It was not a huge inconvenience, but it was unexpected. Again, one might simply be overindulged by other Mexican fast-food options.
The service was outstanding. The cashier was knowledgeable of the menu and explained the concept to curious onlookers. They offer samples of their “aguas frescas,” which are homemade fresh fruit beverages, including their popular lemonade with chia seeds. There is the option to dine in at the food court or take the food to-go. Regardless, the flautas are served in individual clear, plastic containers. Everything is clean and well thought out.
In terms of bringing variety to a mall that is undergoing a revitalization, Flautas is a great concept. It’s a unique venture tapping into a traditional dish that most people have never heard about. Their lack of flavor, however, is not worth the price. There is not much about them that merits a second or third trip back.

Last April, when tensions were high between Japan and China because of disputed island territory, President Barack Obama took a trip to Japan to affirm that the United States will defend Japanese security interests.
Now, Japan finds itself threatened again by one of the globe’s most notorious terrorist organizations, the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, and it is again up to the United States to ensure that they win this fight.
Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, was touring the Middle East in late January to promote Japan’s relations with Middle Eastern countries. On Jan. 20, Abe was made aware that ISIS was asking for a $200 million ransom for two Japanese hostages. The specific request of $200 million is to equal the $200 million in aid Abe has promised to Middle Eastern countries fighting ISIS. After the first hostage was killed, the demand changed to the release of female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi from a Jordanian prison, but the message from ISIS is still the same.
“Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter [journalist] Kenji [Goto], but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found,” said a man in the video of the second hostage’s murder. “So let the nightmare for Japan begin.”
Japan needs a good relationship with the Middle East to support their giant economy; most of Japan’s oil comes from the Middle East. And while the country has been long governed by a pacifist constitution, Abe has been out to change that.
Through his aid package, he aims to side with the United States and their allies to fight terrorism, and he is not considering backing down from these aid efforts after the hostage event. Abe stated after the events this past week that Japan will “never give in to terrorism” and that “Japan will resolutely fulfill its responsibility to the international community in the fight against terrorism.” There is even a bill in the works to allow Japan’s Self Defense Forces to join the allies in efforts abroad.
For the time being, however, the Japanese rely mostly on the United States for security and defense. The Japanese don’t have the manpower or war technology to fend for themselves, particularly in hostage situations such as these, and even if they did, their constitution still prohibits it.
There were many in Japan who argued that the Japanese government should have simply paid the ransom to free the men. To do that, however, would have angered the United States and their allies, who consistently propose to never negotiate with terrorists.
Not only does Japan not want to anger the United States, but the United States also does not want to anger Japan. Should the potentially lucrative Trans-Pacific Partnership fail, there is a possibility that Japan will be the United States’ only reliable ally in the region.
The United States would need to have several sit downs with the Japanese government to determine what level of involvement is necessary, especially considering that much of the country is unsure about whether involvement in the war against ISIS at all is acceptable. But with the promises Obama has already made regarding security and the key role who play for us in Asia, it is clear that we must come to Japan’s defense in their time of need.

Not sure what threat Claire believes Japan is facing. The brutal kidnaping and murder of two of their nationals working overseas was horrible, yes. But Japan does not seem to be facing the widespread Islamic terrorist threat that other countries do. Maybe a better suggestion would be for President Obama to promote a new alliance, similar to NATO. Japan could join it, if they wished.

In a new reign of terror, the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) released a video Saturday of the beheading of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. Though the video’s legitimacy has not been not confirmed, this marked the second purported Japanese hostage killing, the first being businessman Haruna Yukawa. These alleged killings by ISIS are gross obstructions to human rights and world peace, but the United States should refrain from aiding Japan or intervening in ISIS affairs altogether.
The videos created by ISIS are a response to Japan’s entry into the anti-ISIS coalition created by the United States. In June 2014, when ISIS took over Mosul, Iraq’s second most populous city, it sent the world into a state of alarm. Many nations joined the United States to combat the extremist groups. Japan, though never forthright about their support, offered $200 million in aid to anti-ISIS countries. This angered ISIS, which seized the two Japanese hostages and demanded a ransom that matched the financial assistance that Japan had offered other countries. Thus, an Asian world power entered the Middle Eastern conflict.
According to Time, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to propose to Japan’s parliament a motion to fight side-by-side with the United States to counter ISIS. This raises concerns, as Japan is a country that has maintained peace since the aftermath of World War II. This is because most of their military technology is outdated, and unable to combat ISIS. In fact, Time reports that the crisis has revealed Japan does not have the “hardware, training or organization” to rescue the hostages. To pressure the Japanese government into aiding an anti-ISIS agenda would depreciate the defense against an extremist group that is spreading throughout the Middle East. On the other hand, the United States proves that even with ample amount of equipment and strategy, war campaigns can still fail miserably.
Post 9/11, the United States has engaged in nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following the fall of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein came an eight-year effort to rebuild a government according to American standards, but the new leaders have so far achieved nothing for Iraq economically or socially. Afghanistan saw American troops come in to completely eradicate Taliban influence, and while many Taliban members, according to Time, have fled the country to Pakistan, they are still waiting for the troops to retreat and take over the nation once again. Moreover, countless civilians were killed in these countries during the war. Reuters reports that in 2014 alone, the Afghan war claimed 3,188 civilian casualties. Past United States efforts have proven that intervention is, at best, superfluous. The reality, however, is intervention can be insidious to innocent lives.
That isn’t to say that nations have no responsibility, and thus, should adopt an isolationist approach; it’s just that war is not the answer to achieve tranquility. War is the truest demonstration of fighting fire with fire, so instead of targeting a nation, countries should aim to stop the morales and causes behind terrorist attacks. The answer to terrorism is not war; the answer is for nations to stop glossing over inequality that plants the seeds of conflict.
As the threat of ISIS escalates, it’s important for the United States to learn from past mistakes. There needs to be a more effective strategy to eliminate terrorist threat.
