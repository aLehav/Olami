After suffering their largest conference loss of the season against Oregon early in Pac-12 play, the Men of Troy now have a full roster at their disposal and their eyes set on revenge.
“Most definitely [there’s a sense of revenge],” senior forward Bennie Boatwright said. “Whenever you get blown out by a team, you want to come back and beat them the next time.”
In their first matchup, the Trojans were dealing with the distraction of freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr.’s game-time suspension and it showed. USC’s lackadaisical defense allowed the Ducks to shoot 55 percent from the field and 13-for-24 from deep. 
The unheralded Oregon duo of freshman forward Louis King and senior forward Paul White accounted for six of those threes and combined for 38 points in the first matchup against USC. Since starting Pac-12 play, King has lived up to each of the five stars that made him so highly touted coming out of high school, raising his scoring average from single digits to 12.9 points a night. ESPN currently ranks him as a top-60 prospect for the 2019 NBA Draft.
“He’s a very talented offensive player,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We just have to try to challenge his shots and make it tough for him.”
On the other end of the court, the Trojans will have to worry about finding a way to score against Oregon’s stout team defense. During the blowout loss early in their conference campaign, the Trojans were taken aback by the Duck’s defense, scoring a pitiful 60 points — the team’s lowest score all season. The Ducks have leaned on their Pac-12-leading defense, allowing just 64.5 points per game, to make up for their low scoring offense, which at 70.4 points a night only ranks ahead of an 0-13 California team.
“[In the first matchup,] we took bad shots, turned the ball over and didn’t play like we have most of the season,” Enfield said. “We’re a talented team when we pass the basketball, and we need to share the ball.”
An obvious solution to overcoming the Ducks’ defense would be feeding the hot hand of Boatwright, who is coming off a historic performance against California. Boatwright drained a team-record 10 three-pointers on just 13 attempts. Those 10 made threes are more than the total shots Boatwright attempted throughout the entire early-season game against Oregon.
“[Boatwright has] been playing as well offensively as he had his entire career, and it’s been great to see,” Enfield said.
The Trojans will also have to lean on the emerging firepower of Kevin Porter Jr.; the freshman served as a gaping hole in the team’s away loss to Oregon. In recent matchups, Porter Jr. has begun to return to the player that instigated hype from so many Trojan fans early in the season. The 6-foot-6 guard took over in stretches against Stanford and scored an efficient 14 points on just five shot attempts in his last outing.
“Kevin is a very important part of our team off the bench,” Enfield said. “He gives us an explosiveness, and when he plays consistent basketball, we’re pretty good.”
The Trojans will head into Galen Center seeking revenge, as they square off for their senior night matchup against the Oregon Ducks at 6 p.m.

The Trojans won two of their first three games against Nebraska Omaha to start the season 2-1. USC won in dramatic fashion on opening night, as senior second baseman Brandon Perez hit a walk-off single in the ninth inning to seal a 6-5 victory at Dedeaux Field Friday night.
USC put up a fight Friday as it was down 3-0 after the fifth inning. In the sixth inning, senior shortstop Chase Bushor hit a home run to bring the score up to 3-2.
The Mavericks added to their lead by scoring two more runs and bringing the score to 5-2 in the middle of the eighth inning. But the Trojans brought the game to within one run after sophomore right fielder Jamal O’Guinn hit a home run, a two-run blast over the right field fence.
The Trojans managed to stop the Mavericks from scoring in the top of the ninth. In the bottom half of the inning, junior center fielder Matthew Acosta hit a single, allowing junior infielder Tyler Pritchard to score a run to tie the game at five apiece. Later in the inning, Perez kept his composure as he singled to left center field, scoring Acosta and winning the game for the Trojans 6-5.
“It definitely felt good to come back and get that win,” Perez said. “We had some rust to shake off for it being the first game of the season, but I’m glad that we came off on top.”
The Trojans followed up their win Friday night with a commanding performance on Saturday. They claimed the second game of the series with a score of 11-0.
“When the ball goes up in the air, and it goes to the outfield, unless it’s barrelled up, I’m almost 100 percent confident that it’s going to get caught,” sophomore pitcher John Beller said. “Matt [Acosta] and Blake [Sabol] — they got wheels. Jamal [O’Guinn] has an absolute hose, so I have a lot of confidence when the ball goes into the air.”
Both teams were scoreless through the first three and a half innings of play, until USC scored eight unanswered runs in the fourth inning. The Trojans took the game with ease afterward.
“We were able to stay within and have zone discipline,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We got to their reliever and then we had the big inning. I think that coupled with Beller just continuing to throw zero, after zero, after zero made it tough on them because they couldn’t get anything going.”
Beller showed confidence and composure as he took the mound Saturday, throwing five strikeouts in seven innings and giving up two walks. Following the first inning, Beller seemed untouchable, and the Mavericks could not seem to get a hit. Beller threw the first shutout of the season on Saturday.
“I felt confidence throwing strikes today,” Beller said. “I knew the defense was going to play a great game behind me, so I just wanted to put the ball in play and make the plays behind me like they did.” 
However, the Trojans were unable to claim the opening series sweep as they lost Sunday’s game 9-12.
The team dug themselves into a deep hole in the first inning, as freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain gave up five runs to start the game. Hubbs replaced him midway through the first inning with sophomore pitcher Isaac Esqueda. 
Despite the change, the Trojans still allowed 12 runs in the first five innings. The team demonstrated resilience by scoring eight unanswered runs, but it proved to be too little, too late for the Trojans.
The Trojans look to continue their winning form as they host Arkansas next weekend at Dedeaux Field. The first game between the two teams will take place at 7 p.m. Thursday, followed by 6 p.m. Friday and 6 p.m. Saturday.

In the Los Angeles sports scene, 2018 marked a banner year for professional soccer. The surging Los Angeles Football Club exceeded expectations in its inaugural season, finishing third in the MLS Western Conference standings. Meanwhile, 12 miles south in Carson, Calif., the self-proclaimed “G.O.A.T.” Zlatan Ibrahimovic singlehandedly dragged the rest of his LA Galaxy teammates to the playoffs. The 37-year-old striker scored a scintillating 22 goals in his groundbreaking debut on American soil.In 2018, the Major League Soccer undoubtedly made strides in Los Angeles. The city proved it could support two teams — one buoyed by an aging legend with magic left in the tank and another powered by youth and grassroots enthusiasm. For LAFC and LA Galaxy, quality play on the pitch was met with reward, as both teams were ranked in the top ten highest MLS attendance for 2018. Neither club is going anywhere, which is fantastic news for Los Angeles soccer fans. LAFC will attempt to follow in the footsteps of Atlanta United FC, a club that won the most-recent MLS Cup in its second-year of existence. On the other hand, LA Galaxy signed Ibrahimovic to an extension in December, despite reports of mutual interest in a return to Europe. That in itself is enough to designate it as the most compelling team in the United States. “This season, I will bring something for you,” Ibrahimovic said, using his typical, I-am-your-savior rhetoric. “I am looking to break every record in the MLS this season.” With the MLS regular season set to kick off on March 2, here are five Zlatan-sized predictions that will actually come true: Zlatan leads the MLS in scoring and is named MVP
It’s never a good idea to bet against Ibrahimovic, even when he makes some of his more egregious claims. After all, he’s the only player to win 13 domestic championships across four different leagues, and he’s the oldest player to ever score 15 goals in the English Premier League (17 at age 35 in the 2016-17 season). But instead of setting every MLS record like he forecasted, Ibrahimovic will settle for the Golden Boot in 2019. Last season, only Atlanta United’s Josef Martinez (0.96) averaged more goals per 90 minutes than Ibrahimovic (0.92), with the next closest scoring rate at 0.71. Martinez ended up setting the MLS single-season goal-scoring record with 31, but Ibrahimovic started in 10 fewer games. Using goals per game, Ibrahimovic would have been on pace for 27 goals had he played a full season, placing his actual production much closer to Martinez’s lofty total. Given how close they really were in 2018, I expect that Martinez and Ibrahimovic will be neck-and-neck for the Golden Boot this season. However, Ibrahimovic enters the season off of three months of rest, while Martinez endured a lengthy MLS Cup Playoff run. Ultimately, this will make a difference in whether or not Ibrahimovic will successfully add the Golden Boot and MLS MVP to his extensive list of accolades.LAFC wins the Supporters’ Shield as the MLS’s top regular season club 
OK, so Supporter’s Shield isn’t exactly the biggest deal — the trophy matters for about a month until the MLS Cup Champion is crowned in the playoffs. It’d be like if the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints got awards for finishing with league-best records of 13-3 in the NFL regular season. Much like in the NFL, the MLS playoffs are a much different ballgame than the regular season. Of the last seven Supporters’ Shield winners, just one — Toronto FC in 2017 — also went on to win the MLS Cup. Still, a Supporter’s Shield trophy would be massive for LAFC, a club still in its infancy. It’s also fully within their reach in 2019. Despite exiting in the first round of the playoffs last year, LAFC scored the second-most goals (68) in the regular season and produced the second-most shots on goal (204), proving the sustainability of manager Bob Bradley’s attacking game plan, which he simply dubs “good football.” With the addition of Spanish-league goalkeeper Pablo Sisniega and the return of defensive midfielder Eduard Atuesta, LAFC will make a defensive leap in 2019. Coupled with its lethal scoring output, I expect LAFC to solidify itself as the MLS’s best team in the regular season. LAFC and LA Galaxy meet in the MLS Western Conference Finals 
LAFC stays on the come-up for aforementioned reasons and LA Galaxy flourishes with a full season of Ibrahimovic. I don’t expect the Galaxy to dominate the regular season, given the team’s organizational turmoil and defensive holes. At the same time, I don’t see Ibrahimovic missing the postseason two years in a row. He’ll be a man on a mission this year, and once he reaches the playoffs, he’ll score more than 5 goals to carry the Galaxy to their first Western Conference Finals berth since 2014. But…Atlanta United wins its second-straight MLS Cup 
While LAFC and LA Galaxy will meet in the Western Conference Finals, Atlanta United will ultimately repeat as MLS Cup Champions. The club lost its engine, midfielder Miguel Almiron, to the brighter pastures of the English Premier League, but they retained Martinez and added creative midfielder Pity Martinez by way of Argentina. These moves will help Atlanta overcome the LAFC in a tight MLS Cup Final. LAFC will gain valuable playoff experience in the process and continue winning over Angelenos’ hearts.

For many college students, four years of school can seem to fly by quickly. For student-athletes, grueling workouts, travel and the rigors of competing at the Division I level can make it go by even quicker. In this series, the Daily Trojan sits down with senior athletes playing various sports at USC to discuss their experience over the past four years, from their athletic life to their academic life. This week’s senior is men’s golfer Justin Suh, the No. 1 ranked amateur golfer in the world.
Q: What is your favorite memory at USC?
The one that sticks out is winning at Rolling Hills [my junior year], that was the Pac-12 Championship. That one sticks out because the past couple of years, we’ve been close at nationals and last year, we didn’t get to nationals. So Pac-12 sticks out to us as one of our bigger wins. For it to be in front of our home crowd, in front of the whole fanbase, it was a very electrifying win we had against a couple of names — [Cal’s] Collin Morikawa and [Oregon’s] Norman Xiong, two of the top players at the time … It was a picture-perfect win for me.
Q: Do you have any regrets from the past four years?
I don’t regret anything, to be honest. Since freshman year, the goal has always been to become a better golfer. I feel like I’ve done that and progressed — I wouldn’t say slowly, but in a timely manner. Freshman year was a building year. Sophomore year, I was able to get into competition in the lead and the final groups. Junior and senior year, it was all about winning and getting better, getting ready for the next chapter in my life, which is professional golf.
As for the memories and friendships I’ve created at USC, it’s been an unbelievable journey so far. I’ve met such intelligent minds at USC in the business school, in the athletic facility with all our trainers, nutritionists, coaches. There’s nothing to regret.
Q: What’s one thing about golf that most people don’t know?
It’s an athletic sport. A lot of people might put that as not the right term for golf, but it really is. We’re walking every morning, we all have physical demanding needs in our swing, just to hit the ball further. The training that we do … it’s a mentally and physically demanding sport, and that’s something a lot of people don’t realize because you see casual golf as more of the image of golf. That’s not what it is. We’re competing, we’re grinding out there. It’s a tough sport.
Q: What have you had to sacrifice in order to be a student-athlete?
We have to sacrifice a lot. Golf especially, we’re on the road probably the most out of any sport here. When we compete, we travel probably four days out of the week. Most of our seasons, we’re traveling weekdays, so we’re missing a lot of school, we’re missing a lot of classes, and that’s something I can’t really get back … I wish I had more time to be more involved in school activities, but the memories I’ve created with my team and with other student-athletes is unregrettable.
Q: What is your schedule like?
We practice every morning, Monday through Friday. We wake up [around] 5:30 to 5:45 a.m. We have to drive to the course before traffic, and leave before 6 a.m. We tee off right at 7 a.m. every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until 11:30 a.m., get back to campus around noon. Tuesdays and Thursdays we have on-campus practice, wake up around the same time, get to campus around 6:30 a.m., start working until 10:30 a.m. and then weights 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. We have a pretty jam-packed practice schedule, but that’s just what it takes to compete at nationals and perform at the level that we’re at.
Q: What’s next for you?
Right after nationals [in May] is when I’ll be turning professional, so every tournament and every second counts before then.
Q: Do you have any advice for freshman athletes?
Just to learn. One of the best pieces of advice that I got was before I came to college — I talked to a friend of mine, [former Stanford golfer and No. 1-ranked amateur] Maverick McNealy. I went through the same path as him, where freshman year was shaky. Senior year, he ended up winning 11 college titles. I asked for his advice before I came to college, and he said, “Just to learn.” Just to learn from the guys that are on your team because everyone’s good at something. Just enjoy college because I can say it now — it went by pretty quick. It’s just been a learning process.

Groovy guitar riffs. Perfectly synchronized harmonies. High-kicks. Unforgettable choruses.  Thursday night at the LA stop of The Aces’ month-long “Waiting for You” tour, all this and more was present at the iconic Troubadour nightclub.
 Upon entering the venue, it was clear that the four-woman alt pop band  has forged a community through their music. 
The collective passion for these artists ignited the moment The Aces entered the stage. Their confident, inviting demeanor comforted and energized fans amidst their excited screaming, and from there it became clear that the rest of the night was set to impress. The moment the lights dimmed, the Troubadour was their space for the next hour and a half. Their strong group dynamic and morale come from playing music together as friends for over 10 years, with each member bringing their own musical inspirations to the table to create an idiosyncratic sound. 
As “Put It on the Line”, their show-starting song, came to an end, it was clear what makes this group so unique. Lead vocalist and guitarist Cristal Ramirez took advantage of the venue’s intimacy to interact with the crowd. From hopping on the stage’s platforms to leaning into the crowd to sing along with fans, the band reciprocated the crowd’s potent energy and emotional investment.
Even so, each band member had a turn on the mic between songs, sharing their gratitude for their fans and amping up the crowd again and again by hinting at the following song through clever anecdotes. 
While sonically, The Aces can be categorized as alternative pop, their live performance had the high energy reminiscent of pop-punk bands like Paramore, mixed with some of Grouplove’s spontaneity and MUNA’s powerful lyric-beat synchronizations. This energy separates their studio songs from their live renditions, and in the future, their stage production could improve to create a live show unparalleled to any other band of their musical sphere. 
However, obtaining resources doesn’t equate to a superior live performance, and the band’s creativity and passion will shine through whether or not they have large screens or designed sets. One would be wise to experience one of The Aces’ live shows in the intimacy of a smaller venue before their inevitable rise to stardom.

On Valentine’s Day, three powerhouse performers took the stage at Majestic Downtown at The Reserve, empowering audiences with female-centric ideas about relationships, self-love and self-improvement. As a part of the Red Bull Music Festival, each performer brought something distinct to the stage, from Junglepussy’s sensual swagger, to CupcakKe’s candid takes on sex, to Trina’s seasoned stage presence.
The first performer of the night, Brooklyn native Junglepussy, stepped onstage sporting bedazzled jeans and a dizzying combination of swagger and vulnerability. Junglepussy’s provocative songwriting jumpstarted her career in 2012, as she often speaks freely about her sexuality and self-worth.
Junglepussy performed numerous songs from her 2015 album “Pregnant with Success.” Through her music, Junglepussy makes it clear that her achievements are inherently female in nature, creating a significant space for women within the male-dominated field of hip-hop.
Before singing “Country Boy” — a song that showcases her Jamaican and Trinidadian roots — she read aloud one of three love letters typed on her phone.
“When you step into an ungrateful motherf-cker’s life, you actually don’t know they are [ungrateful] until they don’t know what to do with your awesomeness,” she said. “They try to hold the very things that attracted them to you against you.”
Upon hearing this, many women from the audience shouted variations of “F-ck him!” in support of her message of empowerment.
Junglepussy’s performance shined from her natural ability to engage with the audience  through her music.
Chicago-based rapper CupcakKe was the youngest performer of the night, and had the advantage of immediate recognition among younger audiences.
CupcakKe started her set with her most popular songs, such as “Deepthroat” and “Duck Duck Goose.”
The rapper also performed her newest hit, “Squidward Nose,” for the first time in front of a live audience and gave a shoutout to her sizeable LGBTQ fanbase with the song “LGBT.”
Before leaving the stage, CupcakKe turned around and candidly admitted she would be having a lot of sex that night — a statement that was met with laughter, shouts of support and cheering.
Unfortunately, CupcaKke’s upbeat energy seemed to fade throughout the concert, and her performance fell flat after Junglepussy’s charged performance. 
Before the evening ended, the last — and perhaps most anticipated — artist came onto stage with a flurry of poise, glam and confidence. While the previous two performers rose to popularity relatively recently, Miami-born Trina rose to popularity in the early 2000s after being discovered by local Dirty South rapper Trick Daddy. Her debut album, “Da Baddest Bitch,” cemented her status as an influential new-wave female rapper among the likes Lil’ Kim, Remy Ma and Missy Elliott.
Trina brought a crew of backup dancers as she strutted onto the stage. Despite the clear effort put into Trina’s robust production, the small stage felt cramped with upwards of seven people on it at any given time.   
 Trina began her set with “Here We Go,” an emotionally charged number detailing breakups.
After performing “If It Ain’t Me,” she handed out roses to audience members for Valentine’s Day. She then transitioned into her most recent songs, released on mixtapes rather than an album.
While Trina’s performance had more production value than those of her peers, it compromised the intimacy with theatrics, while Junglepussy and CupcakKe spoke directly to their audience. Trina seemed to be going through the scripted motions of her songs for mere performance rather than an attempt to build a genuine, raw connection with a live crowd, and she failed to share any personal anecdotes. Ultimately, Trina’s performance could’ve been more successful, if she had a larger stage to work with. 
All three of these performers are aware of the power society strips away from women in terms of relationships, self-esteem and sexual expression. The performers forcibly took their power back this Valentine’s Day with a lively, female-centric music festival.

A good indicator of the number of siblings one has is how much their parents spoiled them, and a good indicator of my status as an only child is the fact that I owned five American Girl dolls: Emily Bennett, Kirsten Larson, Samantha Parkington, Nellie O’Malley and a Just Like Me doll — a customizable doll that comes in a range of hair and skin shades to cover every ethnicity. Mine is a vaguely Asian-looking one with straight dark hair and almond-shaped eyes who I named Aspen, after I received her as a Christmas present during a winter break trip to Aspen, Colo. 
I rediscovered the dolls, supine and stacked like sardines, during a recent deep dive through my closet, and I started wondering if they had any resale value. All four of the historical ones are currently “retired,” meaning they are no longer manufactured by Mattel. Googling “selling American Girl doll” led me down a rabbit hole of eBay listings, Facebook groups and special forums where “little girls who played with dolls grow up and become collectors who still play with dolls!” 
My queries eventually led me to the American Girl website itself — I have fond memories of playing dress-up games and taking quizzes on the site. 
Growing up, I was consumed by the American Girl franchise: I read all the book series, flipped through the catalogues and dragged my parents to the American Girl store to get my dolls’ hair restyled. Imagine my shock, then, when the website greeted me with the announcement that the January/February issue of American Girl Magazine would be its last. 
I don’t remember when American Girl Magazines began showing up at my house — I think a family friend bought me a subscription for my birthday. Nevertheless, I immediately fell in love with them. I kept every single issue and would try to recreate the covers in my sketchbook. The cover girls were diverse but invariably cute (which was unfortunate for me because I always had trouble drawing their dimples right). 
The magazine was chock full of instructions for recipes and crafts; feature stories on girls around the country; jokes and crosswords and word searches; big calendars during the summer issue that suggested fun activities for every day of the month; posters that I cut out and pinned to my bulletin board. I devoured every inch of those magazines. Cover to cover, I left no word unscrutinized. I tried my hand at the games, took markers to every coloring page and ran to the local Michael’s store for every party favor. I think I actually still have them, buried away somewhere in a storage bin. I doubt I ever had the heart to discard them. 
Maybe it’s silly, but it felt like a punch in the gut when I read that the magazine is being discontinued — like little remnants of my childhood were slipping away with the grains of time. When the magazine was first published in 1992, I’m sure it had no idea that 27 years later, media and technology would so drastically reshape the adolescent experience. I don’t know where young 8- to 13-year-old girls are getting their entertainment nowadays — YouTube? Instagram? I just watched two 11-year-old girls with immaculately made-up faces throw shade at each other on Instagram Live. Witnessing that, it’s hard not to believe that American Girl Magazine — with its wholesome content and focus on keeping girls from prematuration — is of a bygone era, a casualty of the changing times.
It’s disturbing and disheartening to see American Girl Magazine go the way of Teen Vogue and Rookie — publications that also played a formative role for me growing up. I’m sad, less so for my own childhood receding in the rearview mirror and more for the little girls who won’t get to experience the magazine like I did —  the feeling of sprinting to the mailbox, the thrill of a new issue still wrapped in its plastic packaging, heavy with an imminent few hours of total absorption.

There are a few things that one needs to get out of the way when talking about Kenny and Keith Lucas, the pair that makes up The Lucas Brothers.
Yes, they are twins. Yes, they are identical. Yes, they will be running their new special, “The Lucas Bros: A Will to Believe,” Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Dynasty Typewriter. 
All of those things need to be established before discussing their style of comedy — a deadpan duo act, where jokes volley back and forth and the subject meanders from pro wrestling and ’90s pop culture to drug legalization, race, ancient philosophy and mortality. 
That last topic is especially important to the Brooklyn-based brothers these days. Because another thing that one needs to mention when talking about The Lucas Brothers is that they are grieving. Last month, they lost a close friend and collaborator fellow comic Kevin Barnett, who died suddenly of pancreatitis. 
“We’ve known Kevin for what, a decade?” Keith said. “We started doing stand up together in the Brooklyn comedy scene … and we quickly became friends … [Kevin] was a presence in our lives that we never anticipated a not having, so he’s left quite a void.”
When they got the news of Barnett’s death, the twins were preparing a new hour of material — the follow up to 2017’s Netflix special “The Lucas Bros: On Drugs.” Coincidentally, the bits they were writing already dealt with dark themes — what the two former philosophy majors describe as their embrace of nihilism.
“Nihilism means you don’t have access to religion, you don’t have access to any sort of self help thing to get you through life,” Kenny said. “Our particular form of nihilism led us down a more destructive path.”
Even before Barnett’s death, Kenny recalls dealing with depression, substance abuse and how to implement these themes in their comedy. 
“With Kevin’s death,” he said, “everything sort of just crystallized, and we sat down, and we wrote out a more cohesive story.”
According to Kenny and Keith, this story will be a deeply personal reflection. 
“It’s more or less a story about how we went from having faith in God to losing our faith and becoming a bit more destructive to hopefully restoring our faith,” Keith said. “Our goal is to tell that story in a comedic way, but, you know, we’ll see.”  
Other comedians will join the twins Saturday night, including Sasheer Zamata, Brandon Wardell and Quinta Brunson. 
“They’re all phenomenal comedians, and we’re sure they’re going to bring their A-game,” Kenny said.
Though the heavy subject matter may seem the opposite of funny, the brothers emphasized that the evening will still be based around jokes — and that they have found comedy and tragedy to not be mutually exclusive. 
“In going through what we’ve had to because of Kevin’s death, we found that people laugh to sort of cope with the pain,” Keith said. “We actually believe comedy is equal to sadness, that they’re part of the same mechanism … just presented in different forms.”
Tickets for “The Lucas Bros: A Will To Believe” are $15 on the Dynasty Typewriter website or $20 at the door.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate voted unanimously in a meeting on Tuesday to pass a resolution administering the Bringing in the Bystander training program on campus. The first pilot training event, which will be attended by 40 student leaders, faculty and staff participants, will take place on Saturday. 
The resolution was penned by Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Crane, Co-Chief Diversity Officer Shany Ebadi and USG Senators Diviya Gupta and Jillian Halperin. According to Crane, the resolution was drafted following conversations with Director of Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives at Price School of Public Policy Lavonna Lewis, Office of Equity and Diversity Executive Director Gretchen Means and several other leaders on campus. 
“In the wake of all the scandals and sexual assault and harassment that USC has had, we wanted to take a community-based approach to solve this problem and find out what our standards are as a community,” Crane said.
According to the resolution, 59.9 percent of female undergraduates and 52.8 percent of male undergraduates said they witnessed someone drunk heading for a sexual encounter. Of those who reported being a bystander to these interactions, 75.7 percent of bystanders made no attempt to intervene.
“What the statistics show is that we don’t have the standards we should [have], and we don’t have the education that we should [have],” Crane said. “And that’s what this is supposed to do. It’s to start the conversation with administrators.”
According to Gupta, the authors of the resolution split up outreach to recognized student organizations on campus to support the implementation of bystander intervention training. The resolution is officially supported by 54 organizations on campus, including Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services, Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council and Residential Housing Association.
“We reached out to as many organizations as we could between the three of us, and given our time frame, the ones who showed the most support or were most eager to support the resolution, they were able to get featured [on the resolution],” Gupta said. 
The first training event on Saturday is part of a semester-long pilot program launched with Bringing in the Bystander. The training will only be attended by 15 student leaders and 25 faculty and staff members, but in the future, representatives from more student organizations will attend the training sessions, Halperin said. 
“Ideally, it’s one person from each registered student organization to implement and effect the most change on campus,” Halperin said. 
At the meeting, Crane presented his vision for the future of the training program. The resolution will continue for the incoming Senate in the 2019-20 academic year, followed by a trial period through the 2020-21 academic year before it is fully incorporated as an annual requirement in the following year. 
“Especially now, we have seen little effort from administration,” Halperin said. “This is a great partnership that we can use to combat the campus climate and the issues of sexual assault and harassment, and we think that students are eager and want to make that change.”
The training program’s curriculum, Crane said, will focus on appropriate responses to situations and proper protocol for bystander intervention. 
“They have a lot of conversations about appropriate situations and how healthy relationships should proceed,” Crane said. “They put a lot of emphasis on scenarios, and talking through scenarios as a group, saying like, ‘What should happen here? What do we at USC think about this? How should this proceed in a way, when to intervene and how to intervene?’”
In addition to passing the resolution, the Senate voted unanimously to hire sophomore Mikkie Salud, who has had experience as a funding delegate at USG, as the philanthropy fund assistant director.

Explore USC will no longer allow minors to stay with current students on campus. The program, which allows prospective students admitted early as scholarship candidates to visit campus for the selection process, will now require minors to stay with a parent or guardian overnight during the two-day event. 
While scholarship candidates ages 18 and older will be able to stay with a host student during Explore USC, minors must stay with a family member or conduct their interview through a Skype call. The Office of the Provost instituted the policy last summer for all visiting high school-aged students. 
“In order to comply with USC policy, Explore USC now requires that minors be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian,” wrote USC Admissions, the department that runs Explore USC, in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “This change affects few potential students, who do have the option of participating via Skype.”
Explore USC allows admitted students to encounter the campus with a current USC student and interview for scholarships if they’re admitted during the University’s early application period. This year, students interviewing for scholarships can attend one of five two-day sessions throughout February and March.
High school students in the Explore USC program who are unable to stay overnight can interview for scholarships through Skype or phone, according to the University statement. Skype interviews were offered in the past but students were encouraged to attend Explore USC in person.
Simmone Stearn, a senior at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas, CA., will attend Explore USC for a scholarship interview as a prospective architecture student this week. 
“[Staying overnight] would definitely give me a better idea of what the dorms are like and as a person who’s going to attend college, residency is a big part of it,” Stearn said. “I can’t say it would influence my choice … even if I didn’t stay in the dorms I think there are ways to find out what the dorms are like.” 
According to USC’s policies website, minors under the age of 18 cannot be alone on campus or in USC facilities because the environment is not considered appropriate for minors. USC allows minors to stay overnight with friends or family if they have written permission from their guardians.
Freshman Isabelle Vu, who attended Explore USC, is currently hosting high schoolers for the program. She said Explore USC has had a decrease in students staying overnight following the change in policy. 
Vu said staying overnight was one of the highlights of the program.
“When I came here last year, staying overnight was one of the quintessential memories that I have of USC and a huge role in why I came here,” Vu said. “It’s really different touring the school and actually staying overnight.” 
Explore USC held its first session for students interviewing for scholarships last Thursday. High school students in Explore USC who are unable to stay overnight follow the same schedule as other students, but are required to leave at the end of the first day.
Tommy Nguyen, a freshman majoring in history and psychology, is also hosting scholarship interviewees for Explore USC this semester. Nguyen said he doesn’t think the new policy will affect students’ experience and college decision. 
“You can argue that [if] there’s no overnight, the whole experience is ruined, but if you look at it from that perspective, what’s the point?” Nguyen said. “I was with these two greats kids that were really excited … and they didn’t sleep overnight. But we spent four hours in McCarthy, eating dinner in the Village, showing them around all the study lounges, and they loved it.”
Like Vu, Nguyen attended Explore USC as a high school student.
“I certainly don’t think the students are lacking or complaining about anything,” Nguyen said. “From every prospective student that I’ve met, they loved it. They loved this school, they loved seeing all of us, and it was all genuine experiences.”

As part of its mission to advance bipartisan political dialogue, the Center for the Political Future hosted Democratic presidential fundraiser and ambassador to the United Kingdom Louis B. Susman and Republican presidential fundraiser Jack Oliver. The panel focused on growing concerns with the evolution of fundraising in presidential politics. 
“The biggest change I’ve seen [in presidential campaign fundraising] has been the internet,” Susman said. “It’s a whole new game. I don’t think traditional fundraising will be eliminated; I just think its importance will be less.”
Nearly 50 people attended the discussion, which was moderated by the Center’s co-directors Bob Shrum and Mike Murphy. The panel discussed how the internet and social media platforms have equalized the fundraising playing field. 
“What the internet has done is it democratized fundraising so everybody can have a voice,” Oliver said. “You can have a voice as much as you want, and it’s empowering.”
The speakers discussed the behind-the-scenes aspect of campaign donations and how presidential candidates are able to fully maximize their financial resources, especially in light of the 2020 election cycle.
“There are limits [on donations,]” Oliver said. “You can give $2,600 per person per cycle. What becomes important, outside the parties, is people who have spheres of influence.”
Oliver noted the increasing use of campaign donation limits. Because of limits, he said that campaigns have increasingly depended on bundlers — people representing certain communities who gather contributions and present them to the campaigns — as a mode of fundraising.
“The attempt to get these important bundlers and/or grassroots organizers involved in your campaign both at the political level and the financial level is the major focus of most of the men and women running for president right now,” Oliver said.
Oliver said Super PACs — independent political action committees which indirectly support candidates with unlimited donations from corporations, unions and people — and “dark money” groups — non-profit organizations that raise unlimited amounts of money without disclosing donors — also have a stake in campaign financing.
“A lot of people are very critical, on the left and on the right, about these issue campaigns that are run external to the campaigns themselves,” Oliver said. “It is a very controversial piece because you have people not knowing where the money is coming from.”
Susman said that he believes one of the greatest threats to democracy was the 2010 ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court case, in which money was equated to speech.
“People could give unlimited money and you didn’t have to say where it came from,” Susman said. “I think that is dangerous. It shouldn’t be allowed.”
Oliver said another change that has occurred in fundraising is the increasing cost and resources necessary to run for president. 
“It’s expensive to run for president,” Oliver said. “One of the things you want to be able to demonstrate is whether or not you can bring resources together not only financially but organizationally as well.”
Oliver said this has led to the creation of the “permanent campaign,” in which candidates of both parties are constantly preparing for the next election cycle.
“What we’ve seen with the proliferation of news stations and your ability to create your own news vacuum with people who agree with you on 99 percent of the things that you think, is [politics] never stops,” Oliver said.
Susman said that without enough funding, a candidate does not stand a chance to win an election. This means that candidates will take money from corporations and wealthy individuals even if they feel morally disinclined.

When they begin their term in April, Undergraduate Student Government president-elect Trenton Stone and vice president-elect Mahin Tahsin will take on the responsibility of guiding the student body amidst administrative changes at USC.
Stone and Tahsin will enter their term during a series of changes at the University’s administrative level. Last May, former University president C. L. Max Nikias resigned following the Los Angeles Times’ investigation of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall’s alleged sexual misconduct toward students, which eventually led to the appointment of Interim President Wanda Austin. 
“[The greatest issue needing addressing] would be not only the administration but just largely the transition period USC is in right now,” Stone said. “We’re not only missing a president, but we’re going through VP change, cultural changes and overall a renewed look at how this University operates day to day.”
Stone, a sophomore majoring in philosophy and cognitive science, and Tahsin, a junior majoring in business administration and economics, have both worked for USG’s funding department for a few years.
“Mahin and I are used to small organizations,” Stone said. “So moving up to that larger scope will be an interesting perspective to be able to continue the effectiveness of an organization when it’s just much larger.” 
Stone says his and Tahsin’s experience as funding directors has enabled them to acknowledge the University’s needs through a more comprehensive lens.
“The funding directors get to see the ins of USG but also the outs of USC,” Stone said. “We get to see what’s going on across campus with a few hundred student organizations … but also get to spend 16 hours in the office every week and see what’s happening in USG.”
Prior to being elected, Stone and Tahsin said that their experiences working in the funding department has helped them cultivate their working dynamic today.
“That momentum will just continue naturally between the two of us,” Stone said. “We understand each other really well, and that’s why we chose each other.”
Stone and Tahsin said they plan to advocate for more student input on a University-wide level by developing a communicative relationship with the administration. 
Like current USG president Debbie Lee, Stone said he plans to serve on various University boards and initiatives, such as the new Task Force on University Nomenclature, to ensure student voices are represented. 
“There’s a lot of changes going on, and I think right now is such a critical moment for student voices,” Stone said. “Not only to be heard, but to have the opportunity to create a long term commitment to engaging with students and having students on these important decisions.”
As the University continues its period of transformation, the two said they’ll focus on establishing initiatives as permanent fixtures in USC’s structure, including promoting student input, rezoning DPS officers and creating a platform to assist students in accessing University resources.
“Students don’t know how to look for or appropriately utilize [the resources that are available],” Tahsin said. “I think that’s something USC really could, in a very transitional period, make sure [is] enacted well so that it can be a good resource for students moving forward.”
One of the main platform points in Stone and Tahsin’s campaign was establishing a centralized system that enables students to submit questions online and receive answers detailing the resources the University offers, including services, building locations and other miscellaneous information students may need.
“Say an international student can’t find the International Student Resource Center,” Tahsin said. “They can look up ‘where is the International Student Resource Center?’ and it’ll be a like a little answer [such as] ‘it’s in TCC’ or ‘the Student Union.’ ”
Once they start their term, Stone and Tahsin said they will increase funding allocated to student organizations and initiatives. According to Stone, student groups have been denied funding because there were budget cuts to the professional and academic board this academic year, as the demands on USG’s funds often exceed the board’s $60,000 budget.
“I had a couple students that were going to go to Harvard [to] present, and they had to cancel their trips” Stone said. “USC is losing a valuable spot at these conferences. This is just one small example.”
Stone said he plans to address this issue by reallocating USG’s budget. Areas in USG budgeting, including the “few thousands of dollars” spent on USG retreats in the fall and spring, may be reduced and reallocated to other areas that directly serve the general student body, he said.
During their term, Stone and Tahsin said they’ll also push for a rezoning of DPS officers to reach areas students reside in that are not already covered, so that all students living off-campus will be guaranteed safety. 
“If you go to Vermont and 37th St., you can never find a DPS officer there, and there’s students living there, as well,” Tahsin said. “I think it’s important to reevaluate where students are spread out around campus … and how they need DPS support to feel like they have a safe space within this USC vicinity, as well.”
As of now, Stone and Tahsin have been creating applications for students to fill their administration, including positions such as the treasurer, chief of staff and senior director of communications. 
“I’m really excited to hire the next student body representatives because I think that’s what makes USG,” Tahsin said. “That’s what kept me coming back for three years. I’m hopeful to hire people that will create that experience for more people.”
While Tahsin said taking on the roles of vice president and president will be time consuming, she said she believes her and Stone’s commitment will push them to continue working toward their goals for the University. 
“Our campaigning itself has very much demonstrated our work ethic and how we … hold ourselves accountable,” Tahsin said. “I don’t think that will in any way fade over the course of the year because that’s very central to who we are. That’s why we work so well.”

In the past few years, several states have pushed to either encourage or require public schools to offer Bible literacy classes to their students. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump called the idea “great” in a tweet. Having taxpayer-funded Bible literacy classes in schools is not only the opposite of “great” — it’s unconstitutional. If public schools adopt religious education curricula, they must implement a program similar to USC’s curriculum, which is diverse in schools of thought beyond those that use the Bible for teaching.
USC is located in an area that is nearly 40 percent Catholic, according to the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at USC — the next most popular religious affiliation is non-denominational Christian at approximately 4 percent. In other words, University Park is heavily populated by those who believe in biblical teachings. They’re in the overwhelming majority nationally as well, with more than 70 percent of Americans identifying as some sort of Christian, according to Pew Research Center. 
While the majority of Americans are Christian, public schools still should not teach the Bible, as it would result in an illustration of tyranny of the majority, an inherent weakness of democratic systems. Majority rule allows for those in the majority to pursue their own interests, no matter the cost to the minority. This is why the Constitution and its Bill of Rights were established: to bound lawmakers to certain principles that even a majority can’t affect. 
Public education should encourage curiosity and understanding of all kinds of  religious beliefs, but this can’t be done by favoring one tradition over another in public schools. The government cannot, in good conscience, ask tax-paying citizens from other religious traditions to pay for an explicitly Bible-centric course for students. However, the government can, and should, allow public schools to offer a broad spectrum of religious education options. USC’s School of Religion curriculum provides a perfect example.
At USC, the School of Religion offers students a variety of courses on different religious traditions. USC students can take classes on anything from Islamic mysticism to the religions of Japan. This sort of diversity, though it would have to be somewhat abridged and specified, is the kind of diversity that public schools must have if they adopt religious education curricula. 
USC is a private university that can adopt any religious affiliation it wants, but it chooses to remain secular. However, students have formed dozens of religious organizations that are perfectly legitimate. Of these, there are over 40 Christian organizations and numerous others of different faiths. 
If the Christian-based organizations, which are in the majority, were to petition the University to require all undergraduate students to take a course in Biblical literacy, a chunk of students’ time and tuition would go to learning about the Bible, whether they believe in it or not. The University would be biased to the Christian tradition, simply because it is the most represented in student groups. Many students, Christian or otherwise, would be outraged. 
USC is a microcosm for the U.S. in this way. The Constitution states the government will have no involvement in matters of religion. If the government were to sponsor Bible classes in public schools, it would be showing preference to one tradition.
However, if the USC Interfaith Council were to petition the University to require a general religious education course that would cover all of the world’s major religions, it would be a different story. If the U.S. government were to fund religious education for many traditions, there would be no concern about preferential treatment.
A comprehensive religious education would be beneficial for U.S. students because of religion’s prominence in our society and current events. Religiously motivated actions plague newspaper and television headlines every day. Often, communities and cultures are shaped by their systems of belief. To assert that these ideas aren’t important ones would be ridiculous. But when a secular government begins entertaining the idea of favoring one tradition, and does so with taxpayer money, it fails to serve its students effectively and inclusively. Public schools should aim to educate students with the diversity of belief in the U.S. in mind. In secular America, anything else would be, well, sacrilegious.

“What is a FOB?” 
My mother posed this question to me at lunch a few months ago, eliciting silence from me. She obviously picked up on my incredulousness, as she quickly followed up with, “Your brother has been saying it a lot. She is a FOB. He is a FOB. What is it? Is it a bad thing?”
Her rapid-fire interrogation made me more flustered. 
The acronym “FOB,” short for “fresh off the boat,” is a derogatory term often used to describe immigrants of Asian descent who have yet to fully assimilate into American culture. Trying to explain this concept to my immigrant mother, who embodies many of the stereotypical characteristics of a “FOB,” was like pulling teeth. 
“Mom, [the term] ‘FOB’ is used to describe like … Asians who come to America and don’t try to become American at all,” I said. “They only have friends who speak the same language and are obsessed with brand name clothing — that sort of thing.” 
My examples, essentially serving as a checklist of the attributes my mom exhibits, didn’t seem to clear things up for her. So was it an insult then?
Simply put, the answer is yes. The term “FOB” is more often than not used as an insult. It shouldn’t be, but it is. However, what’s so troubling about the word isn’t its existence. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone living in the United States that there are words that mock immigrants who don’t speak perfect English and wolf down hot dogs the moment they arrive in Trumpland. 
The much subtler and more sinister part of the word “FOB” is how often Asians, specifically American-born Asians, use it as a way to condescendingly put down other Asian immigrants. It’s as if by putting down others, we’re somehow distancing ourselves from the stereotype of the “unsociable immigrant.” 
This culture is so widespread that it seems normalized among American-born Asians. We ask ourselves questions like, “Can I wear these striped Nike track pants, or will that make me seem too ‘FOB-by’? Is it possible for me to wear trendy streetwear without seeming like a ‘FOB’?” Such concerns perpetuate a toxic culture of alienating immigrants and exemplify Asian-on-Asian racism directed at immigrants from natural-born citizens.
International students are especially easy to target. The language barrier instantly separates them from other students and intensifies the challenge of coming to college even native-born students face — I can only imagine how difficult it is for international students to become acclimated to events socially, especially since there’s no shortage of memes making fun of international students and mocking their fashion choices, their tendencies to congregate in groups or even their stereotyped smoking habits. 
There’s a degree of cultural dissonance here, where dressing the way they would in their home countries invites laughter and mockery. I often wonder, if people were treated like international students in the U.S. often are when they study abroad, would they still laugh at international students when they returned home? If, when you studied abroad, you had to go alone without any fellow classmates or friends with you, would you be able to adapt as quickly to your abroad country as international students are expected to in America?
American-born Asians should know firsthand what it’s like to be discriminated against due to race. How can American-born Asians in good faith discriminate against our own race because they don’t act the same way we do? American-born Asians are all descended from “FOBs” who first immigrated to America, a fact we seem to readily forget all too often. 
Instead of mocking others for not adhering to our social and cultural norms, maybe we should just mind our own damn business.
