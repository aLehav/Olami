Emo-punk band Sad Park, seized the stage at the Smell Sunday, celebrating the prolonged success of their album “Sleep” after five years. Members Graham Steele, Grant Bubar, Sam Morton and Aidan Memory put on an unforgettable show through their impassioned performance. 
The labyrinth of scattered alleyways within downtown Los Angeles disguise a community constructed from a do-it-yourself scene: the Smell. Sad Park’s vocalist, Steele, belted angsty ballads with his transparently wistful tone as Memory and Morton plucked the strings of their spirited guitars with graceful mastery. At the heart of the set, Bubar fed the unforgiving beat of the drums to the starving crowd in front of him. 
The company of a vivacious tempo provided perfect conditions for chaos to prosper. Buoyant instruments became weapons for frenzy, promising riveting entertainment through a raging inferno of ringing ears and thrashing bodies. 
There was a feverish crowd of Doc Martens, battle jackets and crowd surfers. The lurking zeal from the crowd was ready to strike as the deafening silence from prior ballads suddenly erupted into pure mayhem when an eccentric man with liberty spikes riled up the crowd. He prepared the audience for an adrenaline-induced mosh pit of disorderly commotion. It is safe to say that within this unique, swaying mass of individuals, one was bound to meet a friend from the occasional bumping into and “sorry’s” sputtered in-between sets. 
The band performed fan favorites such as “I Should,” “Awake” and their most esteemed release, “In My Head,” specifically catered to the enjoyment of the audience. Sad Park’s ability to provide a safe haven for fans to feel seen, heard and recognized makes the band memorable. Many artists are able to produce amazing music with appealing beats and catchy rhythms. However, the tendency to fall into deceiving traps of meaningless production for individuals who happen to tune in is forever apparent. Musicians who limit themselves to aimless sounds neglect the need to create an art which influences as well as shapes those around them.
These members are true lyricists, allowing for an authentic dialogue about the troubling mechanisms of mental health and its impactful symptoms to be amplified. Their song, “It’s All Over,” opens up with a muted, barely there strumming of a guitar, allowing for the line “curl up and just die” to speak volumes for itself. This expressive melody illustrates the bitter and harsh realities for someone waging a war against the most intimidating enemy out there — ourselves. 
As Sad Park directs attention towards pessimistic perspectives and the oftentimes apparent bleakness of the world, they also explore positive values in life. This talent for melding the two contrasting ideas of introspective and expressive behaviors is of no simple feat and deserves acknowledgement. 
This sense of belonging and companionship was further illuminated at the band’s sold-out show, as a copious group of fans chanted their favorite tunes in harmony with the many others surrounding them. Sad Park together a hub of creators, imagineers and mavericks to relish in a realm of infinite possibilities. The next time it’s  in town, I highly suggest taking a chance to see Sad Park and enjoy it’s incredible performance.

In an age where anything that isn’t a Marvel movie must fight for elbow room at the local multiplex, perhaps it’s inevitable that any inkling of originality in cinema would come courtesy of the kind of memeable audacity that conspired to produce “Cocaine Bear.” 
The newly forged memeable movie genre, built on the backs of old recognizable genres and spiced up with a requisite “I-can’t-believe-they-actually-made-that-into-a-movie” twist, seems to be an unavoidable phenomenon in the age of social media. Recent entries into this canon include “Violent Night,” “M3GAN” and “80 for Brady,” all of which built their marketing campaigns on sheer attention-grabbing audacity, despite all being fairly traditional genre exercises at their core. 
It seems that this trend has inevitably culminated into a movie that begs so much for attention that its title is literally “Cocaine Bear,” something it could never possibly live up to, however hard it may try. The genius of this title is both its audacity and its simplicity, both of which the actual film could stand to use a little more of.
The film opens with a drug smuggler dumping a cocaine shipment from a plane into the northern Georgia wilderness, and then falling to his death before he can escape with his own stash. This creates a problem for the local authorities, as well as the drug kingpin and his goons, who converge upon the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest to address the situation. It also creates a problem for anyone else who happens to be visiting the forest at this time because, as the title has made very clear, none of them will be getting that cocaine. 
It is instead the titular bear that stumbles upon the drugs, develops an unhealthy addiction and becomes yet another hapless victim of substance abuse. A touching and cautionary tale indeed, but for the vicious killing spree the bear wages upon the masses for the remainder of the film. This is all reportedly based on a true story, although one might assume that certain liberties were taken. 
Unfortunately, the film spends far too much time on its human characters, of which there are far too many. The film is always tracking around six or seven different storylines, which often overlap or converge but never simplify or condense. The various characters get entire storylines devoted to them, but the audience never really cares or even learns much about any of them. There is no cohesive narrative that sweeps us through the various plotlines, just a bunch of disjointed story beats that all feel like they’re out of different movies, united only by the eponymous bear. 
Cocaine Bear herself, as she is so addressed, is far and away the best character — this is a creature feature where the creature actually has a personality. There is a real feeling of meanness that comes across as she mutilates her helpless victims, and she has an uncommon sense of purpose and drive. Naturally, her main purpose is getting another hit of cocaine, which she spends most of the runtime trying to do when she isn’t busy maiming and disfiguring the human characters. At the same time, though, she is just a mother trying to protect her cubs — a poignant touch, indeed.
The film is at its best when it allows her to shine, and the bear attack sequences are the obvious highlights of the movie. Even here, though, there is a feeling that the film is afraid of itself, and with few exceptions is hesitant to indulge in either the zaniness its premise should inspire, or the graphic violence any self-respecting gorehound would expect. The sequences settle for an unfortunate middleground, where they would have been better served to be either scarier, funnier or crazier, but in trying to be a little bit of everything, are only pleasantly diverting. 
In between the film’s signature bear sequences are some hit-or-miss attempts at quirky character comedy, some of which are amusing and others that feel bizarrely out of place. To the film’s credit, it is never boring, but it also doesn’t include anything crazier than its now infamous trailers have already teased. It lacks focus, which perhaps makes it emblematic of the film’s title, but also lacks energy, an area where it could have taken a few notes from its title character. 
While the film fails to match its title’s audacity, it at least never betrays its title’s accuracy. It’s certainly preferable to the monotonous sludge of an “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” because it at least feels different, an increasingly refreshing and rare commodity at the multiplex. If “Cocaine Bear” is the future of originality in cinema — or rather, the future of cinema itself — then, at the very least, it will be fun while it lasts.

The No. 13 USC men’s volleyball team played two games against No. 9 Stanford this past weekend. They lost their Friday night game 3-1 but won Saturday night 3-2. The roller coaster weekend for the Trojans fortunately turned a devastating descent into a huge turnaround. 
In Friday’s game, the Trojans fell behind early, suffering a 25-22 first set loss, but evened the match up in the second set with a 26-24 win. 
Unfortunately, they couldn’t extend that momentum, as they were thoroughly trounced by Stanford 25-16 in the third set and 25-20 in the fourth, giving Stanford a 3-1 match victory. Lost momentum lingered on the minds of the Trojans postgame. 
“Every point is a new opportunity, you’ve got to flush what happened before or else it will compound against you,” said junior setter Nate Tennant. 
Though the Trojans struggled as a group, Tennant played well, recording 39 assists and 9nine digs, and even swinging away for 2 kills. 
Head Coach Jeff Nygaard said Tennant’s kills exemplified his will to make the necessary play. 
“There’s just those times where, whether you’re prepared to do it or not, you have to be able to execute, so Tennant just stepped up and executed,” Nygaard said. 
When Tennant wasn’t trying his hand at hitting, he fed senior opposite hitter Simon Gallas’s hot hand. Gallas recorded his season-high of 21 kills. 
The duo’s offensive efforts helped the Trojans compete fiercely, but weren’t enough to beat the Cardinal. It was the Trojans’ fifth 3-1 loss to a ranked team in a row.  
But, the Trojans flipped the script in Sunday’s match. 
They got off to one of their fastest starts of the season, hitting .423 in the first set and held Stanford to only a .185 clip, fueling a 25-19 win. However, the Cardinal dominated the second set on their way to a 25-18 win. 
The third set was tighter, but little by little, Stanford built a 24-20 lead, putting them 1 point away from set victory. 
But it wasn’t over. The Trojans roared back with 6 unanswered points to win 26-24 and take a 2-1 lead in the match. 
Junior outside hitter Jackson Reed loomed large in the comeback. Reed put immense pressure on the Cardinal with his serving, culminating in an ace on the final point of the set. With no margin for error, many players would crack in that situation, but not Reed. 
“I’ve dreamed of that moment and I’ve visualized that moment so many times,” Reed said. “When I was getting recruited, I was talking to Nygaard and one of the intangibles I have is being clutch, and that showed today.”
The Trojans still needed to secure one more set win to ensure victory in the match. They fought hard to end the game in four, but couldn’t pull it off. The Cardinal eked out a 25-22 win, sending the match to a decisive fifth set. 
Both teams’ will to win showed in the fifth set. They matched one another point for point, and the set was tied 14 times, until the Trojans were able to get 2 points in a row when it mattered. Following freshman outside hitter Dillon Klein’s final hit off the hands of the Cardinal blockers and out of bounds, Galen Center celebrated as the Trojans emerged with a down-to-the-wire 17-15 set win and a 3-2 match victory. 
Klein was fantastic all match with a career-high 29 kills. He completely took over the game in the fifth set with 7 kills and no errors. 
Reed was another vital contributor. Reed has mostly been a serving specialist for the Trojans thus far, but in this game, Reed came off the bench and did a bit of everything, setting career highs in kills with 7, hitting percentage with a .467 clip, and digs with 9. 
“I’m stoked for [Reed], and he was a big factor in our win today,” Nygaard said. 
The victory is the Trojans’ first against a team ranked higher than them. 
“To get the win against a ranked team feels a little bit like getting the monkey off our back, we knew we could do it … we just had to put it together,” Nygaard said. 
USC’s depth was showcased all evening, as 12 different players saw the floor. Their ability to depend on anyone gives them a unique identity. 
“We like looking at our team and saying ‘We’re 19 strong,’” Nygaard said. “What that can unpack and  mean is that there are a lot of guys who can go out and do a lot of things for us.” 
The “19 strong” mentality will help to keep the Trojans energized and confident down the stretch of the season. 
The Trojans’ next test is a home match against Menlo this Friday at 5 p.m.

USC women’s water polo had another successful tournament over the weekend, defeating Loyola Marymount, Arizona State and UCLA before losing to Stanford in the final round.
Redshirt junior 2-meter Tilly Kearns led the offensive effort by scoring 12 goals in the tournament. Redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber added 9 more to the tally. Overall, the Trojans outscored their opponents 57-32. 
On the defensive side, senior goalie Carolyne Stern recorded 33 saves over the weekend. 
All four teams that USC played were ranked. The Trojans started off the tournament by defeating No. 23 Loyola Marymount in an 18-7 comeback victory Friday. After trailing the Lions 6-5 at halftime, the Trojans scored 8 in the third quarter while limiting LMU to just 1 goal in the second half. Senior driver Téa Poljak led all players with 3 goals.
The Trojans advanced to knock out No. 7 Arizona State 16-4, scoring 12 goals in the first half before easing off the throttle. The Trojans’ shutout of the Sun Devils in the third quarter marked the tenth regulation period this season in which USC blanked an opponent.
Both Weber and Kearns recorded 3 goals each. In total, nine Trojans scored in the game.
In the semifinal round, USC won against its crosstown rival UCLA for the second time this season 13-10. Kearns struck again for a season-high 4 goals, including 3 in the fourth quarter that helped the Trojans break away from the Bruins. 
Redshirt junior driver Alejandra Aznar tacked on a season-high 3 more. Saturday’s victory marked the third time in a row the Trojans have defeated the Bruins, going back to last season.
In Sunday’s championship game, USC faced off against No. 1 Stanford. Although the Trojans had many triumphs last year, one opponent that consistently gave them problems was Stanford. 
Last season, the Cardinal defeated the Trojans in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Final at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The final nail in the coffin came when Stanford knocked off USC to win the 2022 NCAA National Championship.On Sunday, the Cardinal continued its success against the Trojans, narrowly handing the Trojans their first loss of the season, winning 11-10. 
“It was a great match,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It was a great fight. It was awesome.”
Stern blocked 12 shots in the cage, the fourth time this season she recorded 10 or more saves in a game.
On the offense, Kearns and Weber netted 3 goals each for the second time in the tournament. After the tournament, Weber is now 12th all-time in USC career goals with 173. However, the 11 offensive fouls called against USC disrupted the Trojans’ momentum. 
“When you are on offense and you commit this many offensive fouls, this is what feeds [Stanford’s] fast breaks,” Pintaric said. 
Cardinal freshman driver Jenna Flynn led all players with 5 goals. The San Jose native scored the first 2 goals of the match and provided the game-tying strike late in the fourth quarter.
Cardinal redshirt junior driver Ryann Neushul tacked on 4 more goals. Flynn and Neushul provided just over 80% of Stanford’s goals. 
With ten seconds left, Cardinal senior 2-meter Sophia Wallace provided the go-ahead blast. Anzar had a chance to extend the game into overtime, but her shot bounced off the post and rolled into the goal after the buzzer sounded.
USC will travel to Pomona next to face four more teams in the Convergence Tournament. The first game will be against Iona (5-2) Friday at Haldeman Pool.

The greatest time of the year is almost upon us: March Madness. After about five months of regular season play, the time of attempting to watch four games at once during your classes has returned. And with that, we can start to figure out who are the contenders and pretenders in college basketball. So, why not do this with the two college basketball teams we have here on campus: the women’s and men’s teams.
Heading into the season, the two programs had very different expectations. The men’s team was only two years removed from their Elite Eight run and were coming off a year where they tied a program record for most wins in a season with 26. On the other hand, the women were coming off of a 12-16 season and hadn’t made the NCAA tournament in nine years. It was expected that the men would return to the tournament once again, and the women were trying to see what the second season of Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb would bring.
At this point in time, both teams sit with the same record of 21-8. The women have finished their season, and the men have two more games against the Arizona schools. Although their records may indicate that they’ve had equal success, the games that make up those records and the strength of the opponents they’ve played tell a different story.
Currently, the USC women’s team has the 65th hardest schedule in women’s college basketball, while the men have the 80th hardest schedule in men’s college basketball. It might be a negligible difference in the strength of schedule, by a few percentage points, but consider that the majority of the games played are against conference opponents. Based on RPI rankings, the men’s Pac-12 is the worst of all Power Five conferences and only the seventh-best conference overall. Meanwhile, the women’s Pac-12 is the best conference, meaning it has the toughest opponents, based on RPI in all women’s college basketball.
It’s also worth noting that the women’s team has a significantly higher NET ranking than the men’s team. The women’s current NET ranking is 30th in the country, while the men are sitting at 45th. Based on these metrics, the women are not only playing tougher opponents but are getting higher-quality wins.
Obviously, there is no perfect comparison when looking at women’s and men’s basketball teams. They essentially play in two different leagues with different play styles.
Even when looking at two men’s teams or two women’s teams from different conferences, there’s no end-all-be-all to know exactly which team is better. The best we can do is look at their current resume and compare them; when doing that, it becomes evident the women’s team sticks out compared to the men.
If you’ve seen the women play this season, you know they pass the eye test. Their defense is Final Four caliber, allowing just 54.8 points per game, good for 16th in the entire country. Their win against then No. 2 Stanford earlier this season doesn’t get talked about enough, and just how impressive it was. It takes a special kind of team to beat a Stanford team that had won 39 straight games against Pac-12 opponents.
The offense is the only thing that can be shaky at times for the women, 69.2 points per game, but they’ve had their share of close games and know what it takes to win them. Their last six games have all been within 6 points, winning four of those games. The USC women have been waiting a long time to return to March Madness, and this is their year to show out.
At the moment, both teams are right on the edge of the bubble in terms of actually making it into the tournament. ESPN has the men’s team as one of the last four teams, and the women nestled into a ninth seed. It’s hard to know if both teams will definitely make the tournament, but if they get at least one win in the conference tournament, both programs should be able to book their ticket to the big dance.
The men’s and women’s teams have had memorable seasons, but it’s the women’s time to shine this March. The women are not just the better USC team, but they’re a lot better than people give them credit for. It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if the women win a few games at the Pac-12 tournament and keep on dancing all the way to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament; they’re just that good.

Happy Tuesday, Trojans! I missed you guys last week, but don’t worry — we have a lot to catch up on.
Some quick fashion news, because an astronomical amount has happened in the past two weeks:
1. Pharrell Williams was named the new mens creative director of Louis Vuitton.
2. Milan Fashion Week brought strong and refreshing performances from Prada, Gucci, Jil Sander and Daniel Lee’s Burberry.
3. London Fashion Week paid a devoted and heartfelt tribute to the late Vivienne Westwood and Central Saint Martins debuted their annual graduate student showcase.
But what we’re here to talk about today is Mugler’s new — tentative — reputation as a mogul of collaborations.
Following suit after Simone Rocha’s capsule collection for the same company in 2021 Mugler announced their upcoming collaboration Feb. 27 with H&M, a fast-fashion giant. 
Of course, H&M does not even compare to other fast fashion sites like SHEIN, which recently revealed that it is projected to double its revenue to $60 billion by 2025, but this collaboration may be what it needs after three straight years of falling shares. 
Mugler, though, has been on a bit of a collaboration rampage, working with Jimmy Choo for the Spring/Summer 2022 season and Wolford’s “Skinwear” collaboration in 2022. 
I’ve mentioned collaborations before in my column — they’re an exciting way to learn about new brands and get more bang for your buck, literally. 
But this collaboration hasn’t been met with the same level of excitement as other luxury collaborations like Fendace (Fendi x Versace) or Louis Vuitton x Yayoi Kusama; on a side note, shoutout to the visuals team for the Yayoi Kusama physical installations in its storefronts. From an animatronic Yayoi Kusama to a giant Yayoi Kusama “painting” on the physical stores, each installation has been incredibly creative, beautiful and, most importantly for consumers in the digital age, interactive. 
Back to H&Mugler. 
So, where does this hesitancy stem from? Part of it is anger over L’Oreal and Mugler’s creative director Casey Cadwallader’s decision to work with a fast fashion company. Especially with fashion’s attempt to push sustainability, it seems like luxury brands that often pave the way and provide inspiration should also be following suit in regard to any collaborations. 
There’s already been a vast issue of greenwashing, and recent reports under PrettyLittleThing’s resale marketplace have raised suspicion of throwing a veil over the effects of mass consumption and factories working overtime during the coronavirus pandemic. The other issue with the rise of resale — as much as I love a good thrift grail — is that it may soon jeopardize the seasonal model that the fashion industry currently follows, especially with the estimated $57 billion expected to hit by 2025. 
Another part is the idea that working with a retail company cheapens Mugler as a brand. It may be the ultra-“Hunger Games”-capitalism view of not wanting to blend retail and luxury, but this melting has been happening for years. We see this with Adidas x Gucci, Supreme x Nike, Miu Miu x New Balance and Balenciaga x Crocs; while these huge collaborations are often with sneaker brands, we also see this with higher-market brands like Skims x Fendi, Shu Shu Tong x Asics and Sandy Liang x Target. 
These fears are far from true, though, mainly because of how luxury status is achieved. 
It’s not through price point — you can price things however you would like to, truly — but rather through time, effort, recognition and brand history. It’s not a Michelin star: It isn’t stripped away out of the blue from random inspections, and there isn’t a limited amount of stars available to be a comparison factor for quality. 
But, most importantly, because price point, rarity and verbal buzz don’t equate to having value. This concept is incredibly important to keep in mind as you sift through flea markets and Depop offers — take all the precautions to avoid getting ripped off for ridiculously high resale prices or fakes. Especially with the falling economy and fashion’s current issue of overproduction with underconsumption, it’s important to recognize quality in a garment in three ways: physical condition, value and sustainability over time, and personality. 
Physical condition is pretty self-explanatory: Is it made well? Are there any large, visible holes? How well does it fit you? If the answer is not very well, how vast of adjustments need to be made?
When considering value and sustainability, ask whether or not the garment will grow with you or end up at the back of your closet. Sometimes it’s fun to get that one, vibrant, beaded dress you would never wear — it’s a great way to keep you mentally stimulated and keep your wardrobe fresh and exciting. But, if you’re constantly buying things to only wear once without the conscious effort to wear it again, maybe consider clothing rentals or borrowing similar pieces from friends. 
For personality: How in tune is the garment with you? With your values? With where you believe your life is going or can go? Do you see yourself wearing this to more than three events? What are five outfits that include this item?  With such personal relationships that come with clothing, the label shouldn’t matter — on its own and in collaboration with others. 
I personally am excited to see how this collaboration will end up. I predict various catsuits, bodysuits, gloves and leggings, but I also am sniffing out the return of Mugler’s iconic star messenger bag and sunglasses. 
With H&M’s recent return to basics in an effort to compete with Zara and keep up with the ‘capsule collection’ concept, this might be the push it needs to keep up with its fast fashion competitors. But until we see it in stores, I have a feeling that Mugler might be the next king of collaborations.

A team of researchers at the Keck School of Medicine documented the effect of adopting zero-emission vehicles in one of the first-ever studies in the field that reveals the association between ZEVs, air pollution and public health. 
ZEVs — primarily electric cars — have been presupposed as a pivotal part of the effort to ameliorate the climate crisis. However, not many studies have been done to bolster the widespread hypothesis.
The paper, published this February in Science of the Total Environment, analyzed the “natural experiment” in California as consumers’ adoption of ZEVs upticks rapidly. As ZEV adoption rose in a given zip code, local air pollution levels and emergency room visits dropped, the study found.
Erika García, an assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s lead author, has studied air pollution exposure in California for years. As the number of electric vehicles on the road has increased, she started wondering about the effect this would have on her field of study.
“As we are making this transition to electric vehicles, what are going to be the impacts on the air we breathe, and on the health of the community?” García asked.
Researchers at Keck obtained and analyzed four distinct datasets to study the effect of ZEV adoption. They first obtained data on ZEVs, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars, from the California Department of Motor Vehicles and cataloged the registration information into different zip codes. 
The researchers also acquired data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency air monitoring sites on levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gaseous air pollutant that aggravates respiratory diseases, particularly asthma. They then calculated the percentage of adults in each zip code who held college degrees, a conventional indicator of the neighborhood’s socioeconomic status.
“What was really crucial is that … we are able to adjust for what’s called potential confounders,” said Sandrah Eckel, an associate professor of population and public health sciences at the Keck School of Medicine and the study’s senior author. “So, we wanted to control, for instance, socioeconomic status [of each zip code] to make sure that we weren’t finding spurious associations.”
Among all zip codes in the state, the average number of ZEVs in each area increased from 1.4 to 14.6 per 1,000 people from 2013 to 2019. The study found that for every additional 20 ZEVs per 1,000 people, there was a 3.2% reduction in the rate of asthma-related emergency visits and a suggestive drop in NO2 levels. 
The study also found that ZEV adoption was significantly lower in zip codes with lower levels of educational attainment. A zip code with 17% of its residents holding bachelor’s degrees had, on average, an annual increase of 0.7 ZEVs per 1,000 people, whereas zip codes with 47% of the population having a bachelor’s degree had an annual increase of 3.6 ZEVs per 1,000 people.
This disparity in adoption rates of ZEVs in zip codes with varied socioeconomic status — which researchers dubbed the “adoption gap” — has underscored the challenge to enact environmental justice in low-resource communities, given that they have been disproportionately affected by tailpipe emission pollution.
“[The adoption gap] is particularly concerning,” García said. “Those communities that have residents that are of lower socioeconomic status might face additional barriers to accessing clean technologies, like electric vehicles, for a multitude of reasons.” 
Researchers recognize the limitations that the study faced. For one, analyzing the real-world benefits of ZEVs is much more complicated than merely recording NO2 levels in different neighborhoods. For instance, producing lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles is more material-intensive than producing traditional combustion engines. As such, the extraction and processing of lithium from hard rock mines or underground brine reservoirs require a significant amount of energy coming from fossil fuels.
“A lifecycle analysis of technologies … is something that we do not consider here,” García said. “We only really look at the use or presumed use of electric vehicles, and we only really look at one type of air pollution, which is tied to traffic-related emissions.”
Even though electric vehicles could drastically reduce tailpipe emissions, the non-tailpipe emissions produced by ZEVs — like brake wear or tire wear, which also present health concerns — are left unanalyzed in the study. This is of particular concern warranting further research, García and her colleagues said, as electric vehicles produce more non-tailpipe emissions than their inner-combustion counterparts. 
“The study is great in that it is showing very early evidence that you could detect health effects of lower NO2,” said Rima Habre, an associate professor of population and public health sciences. “But we need to know a lot more about some of these other non-tailpipe emissions from electric vehicles, and how it sort of all plays out together.”
García said it was also difficult to disentangle the data from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
“The pandemic impacted people and subsequently their health in many different ways,” García said. “If you are having asthma symptoms and you are worried, but maybe you are also worried about getting your child sick with COVID-19, [so] maybe you weren’t going to the emergency room.”
Researchers said they are content with their discoveries and hope the study leads to further policy changes that provide more resources to low-resource communities.
“We really do need to make sure that, with continued research, that there are appropriate policies and interventions put in place so that we can make sure that these benefits are equitably distributed across communities, especially those that are most vulnerable,” García said.

I hear USC students’ stomachs rumble all the time. While the LGBTQ+ Student Center bloats me with crackers and Cheetos, I wonder what the gusher-less het kids do. Is this what it means to be a Trojan? To have to choose between spending $12 for an acai cup and going hungry? 
Considering the widening wealth gap — the lowest 50% of earners own merely 3.3% of wealth — we shouldn’t be surprised that food access is nationally poor right now. But for a country that boasts prosperity, it’s embarrassing. According to the Washington Post,  “41% of college students in the United States report limited or uncertain access to food in the last 30 days,” while in Los Angeles County, 24% of households are food insecure as of July 2022. 
Studies have shown that access to healthy, affordable food is intertwined with countless factors pertaining to our quality of life and can impact students’ GPA and likelihood of graduation. It’s not just about hunger, it’s about survival — in an already overwhelming and stressful climate.  
For those who study urban planning or policy, you might see this as by design. Specific policy and design decisions have been made to prioritize profit over access to meals, using a variety of strategies: inflating costs, limiting where food can be found and restricting who it can be shared with. 
Students like Jonathan Antonio, a first-generation and low-income senior majoring in public policy, claim that the construction of the USC Village was the beginning of this long-standing pattern of blocking food access. USC Village raised rent prices astronomically, leaving all but one local business displaced, despite promises made by USC to protect local establishments. Superior Grocers, a popular grocery chain in South Central, has been replaced by more expensive places such as Trader Joe’s and Target — which do not cater to the needs of the community in which we gentrify.
To the community members like Antonio, this change sent a very specific message. A part of USC’s larger gentrification footprint, it was an effort to make USC feel more like a college town, but also a displacement tactic — a strategic way to control local migration. When people in power want to push people out of the neighborhood, limiting food access is a fast-track solution. 
Grace Zhang, a junior majoring in American studies and ethnicity, defines food apartheid as a structural commitment to creating this in-access to maintain profits and power, one that “systematically disinvests into Black, Latine and marginalized communities.”  
Low-income and graduate students are among groups disproportionately affected by the inflated costs of food at USC. Grad students, which are underpaid by the University, are disconnected from meal plans and also frequently have later classes, presenting an even more limited set of options. 
This year, the University implemented new freshman meal plans — a clear response to student organization efforts last year (Trojans Give Back, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation and AYU Direct) to donate meal swipes. These meal plans prevent students from being able to donate meals, aside from their seven guest swipe-ins. 
For students like Dominic Jocas, founder of AYUDirect, donating extra food created the opportunity to easily connect with members of the community — sharing more than just a meal. 
“That food that was donated from USC was kind of like that central link to creating connections … the currency almost to get your foot in the door of getting to talk to them”, said Jocas, who cited the change in plans as making it a lot harder to engage with people with unmet needs. 
The Undergraduate Student Government recently hosted a roundtable with campus dining. When asked by Hospitality and Dining directors about mistreatment of dining staff workers and recent food decisions which block accessibility, USC followed its apolitical script, saying a whole lot of nothing and, of course, deflecting accountability. 
This deflection of accountability is shameful, yet it is a reflection of USC’s — and many colleges’ — broken systems, which are fragmented and decentralized. Consider this extremely flawed logic: The department responsible for making money off food and feeding students (Campus Dining) is far removed from the department that makes sure students are fed (Student Basic Needs). 
The USC Board of Trustees should make more investments to repair the wounds of their financially extortive actions. Whether that be reversing the freshman plans to make donating up to 19 meals a week universally possible and allowing swipes to be used anywhere on campus, or doubling the funding for Student Basic Needs and the First-Generation Success Center. Increasing pay and time-off benefits for their dining staff are also solutions USC should take. But in a world where business executives change Verde to Taco-Taco to appeal to white people, we can’t expect these same executives to care about food access, especially not food access in a predominantly low-income, brown community. It’s unrealistic. 
Thus, as we advocate for funding reallocation, we should also financially disinvest from USC. We should stop paying for Seeds sushi, which, let’s BFFR … you don’t have to tell me twice!
We should invest in organizations like SCALE, who refuse to blatantly ignore these issues by not just advocating but coming up with attainable community-led initiatives. Their most recent event was a Mardi Gras cookout where they distributed food, hygiene products and clothes to the community by raising money with AYUDirect on social media. They also normalize having conversations about unmet access needs and CalFresh — working against an elitist, individualist, capitalist culture that assumes wealth.
If students taking classes and working jobs to support themselves can contribute positively to food access in the community, why can’t the University?

On Jan. 27, 1945, the Holocaust’s deadliest concentration camp, Auschwitz, was liberated, allowing survivors to start a new chapter of life. However, many did not make it to this monumental day. Six million Jews lost their lives in the Holocaust; nearly 1.1 million of them in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Most Jews know these numbers. 
There needs to be more emphasis on these statistics outside of the Jewish community. Still, today, many states do not require Holocaust education in public schools. And more than 50% of adults in the United States do not know how many people lost their lives in the Holocaust, according to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center. Merely knowing the Holocaust happened is not enough to understand the extent of the tragedy.  
As a diverse institution, with nearly 50% of the student body coming from states outside of California, USC has the opportunity to spread awareness to those who may not have gotten a sufficient education in primary school or are not enrolled in university classes that cover the topic. 
However, to my disappointment, USC seemed to sweep over Holocaust Remembrance Day, celebrated worldwide this past Jan. 27. Although the Shoah Foundation — USC’s nonprofit organization dedicated to the testimony documentation of survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust and other genocides — hosted some memorial events, the University did not create widespread awareness. 
USC is notorious for hosting events — from extravagant concerts, to random free food and notable guest speakers. The University typically has over 10 special events each day. So why couldn’t they squeeze one in for Holocaust Remembrance Day? 
USC’s social media accounts did not spread Holocaust awareness on Jan. 27, either. @uscedu did not speak up about the genocide on Instagram, even though this account often posts to honor other causes. 
Education is what prevents history from repeating itself. USC is home to the next generation of policy-makers, politicians and lawyers who must fully understand the Holocaust to avoid similar affairs in the future. It is equally as crucial for the newest generation of voters to take the deep-rooted history of antisemitism into account at the polls. 
Even during the past few months, the Southern Californian Jewish population has dramatically suffered from antisemitism. In October 2022, Los Angeles civilians praised rapper Kanye West for his antisemitic slurs. Then, last month, a banner hung on the I-20 overpass blamed Jewish people for global issues, including slavery and child trafficking. And last week, UC Santa Barbara was burdened with antisemitism on campus. Israeli politics professors found antisemitic statements on their chalkboards, and Holocaust-denying flyers were distributed around Isla Vista. 
However, silence is also an act of antisemitism. How could a university not call attention to a genocide that took more than 6 million lives? Especially USC, which has such a prominent Jewish student body. Is it insensitive not to highlight a violent period that affected the lives of all 2,000 Jewish Trojans — whether they had ancestors in the Holocaust, experienced antisemitism or lived knowing that World War II is why the Jewish community is such a small minority group. 
My maternal grandfather was born in a refugee camp for Holocaust survivors on the Czech-German border. His trauma-bonded parents, who were just grateful to be alive, spent their mid-thirties starting over in Ecuador — a new country they did not know the language or customs of. From a young age, I have learned that I am only here today because my great-grandparents were part of the marginal group that made it to January 27, 1945. 
I also grew up knowing that people hated me merely for my religion and culture. This was a concept that took me a while to understand. I vividly remember being perplexed, thinking, “maybe Hitler and the Nazis would like us if they got to know us,” but I had hope because I thought society had changed. Instead, society forgot.
The slogan for Holocaust Remembrance Day is “Never Again.” But how is that possible if society forgets? Universities like USC must take action to continue the remembrance of the Holocaust through passing it onto the newest generation of intellectuals and ensure that history does not repeat itself. 
It is vital that USC correctly recognizes Holocaust Remembrance Day next Jan. 27. Whether the University brings in a guest speaker, places flyers around the school, or — at the bare minimum — posts on Instagram, there must be at least some form of acknowledgment.
At least we now have a Daily Trojan article in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day 2023.

This is the second article in an ongoing series investigating Supreme Court cases slated for the current term and their impacts on the USC community. In light of current events, the Daily Trojan News section believes it to be in the community’s interest to include the goings-on of the Court in our coverage. New installments will be published weekly.
President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11246 in 1965 following the successes of the civil rights movement — culminating in his signing of the Civil Rights Act. The Order required that federal contractors “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national origin.”
More than half a century later, two cases on the Supreme Court’s docket are posing a substantial challenge to affirmative action as justices consider whether admissions programs that factor in an applicant’s race are unconstitutional. The Daily Trojan spoke with students, staff and University officials to understand the impact a potential repeal on affirmative action could have on USC.
Students for Fair Admissions — a nonprofit representing more than 20,000 students, parents and others, according to their website — is spearheading the two cases, one against Harvard University and one against the University of North Carolina. In their opening brief, plaintiffs claimed the “only realistic way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” They argued that affirmative action develops a “racial balancing” effect that admits less qualified applicants and counterintuitively discriminates against certain groups — such as Asian American students — who are more deserving of being admitted. 
The constitutionality of race-conscious admissions has been a source of heated debate in the Court since 1978, when the Court concluded in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that racial quota systems used in admissions violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Three decades later, in 2003, the Court acknowledged state interests in considering race and a diverse student body in Grutter v. Bollinger, declaring that race could be one of the many factors considered in college admissions. This stance was sustained in 2016, when the Court wrote in deciding Fisher v. University of Texas that affirmative action was still a “compelling governmental interest.”
Given how the standards of affirmative action policies have evolved over time, Kendrick Davis, chief researcher of the USC Race Equity Center at Rossier School of Education, said that SFFA v. Harvard and SFFA v. UNC represent unique conditions that could potentially result in the elimination of race as a factor for college admissions.
“If you look at the dissents and pretty much all the affirmative action cases — and particularly Fisher v. Texas — you see this constant encroaching of, under the right circumstances, challenges to affirmative action that might actually be upheld by a new composition of the Court,” Davis said. “What we see now is this intersection of interests where the circumstances allow for SFFA v. Harvard and [SFFA v.] UNC.” 
Tyler Quick, a graduate student studying communication, said SFFA’s argument about the nature of affirmative action being racially discriminatory was an oversimplification of the reality of race-conscious admissions. 
“That opinion is so unmoored from reality,” Quick said. “If you deny people who’ve been historically denied opportunities, you’re compounding their misery, their oppression and the difficulty for those who do make it [in].”
Conversations around affirmative action have bred harmful myths among students at USC, said Kenna McGraw, a sophomore majoring in business administration. She relayed what she felt was a common assumption some USC students make about Black students in particular: that Black students would be incapable of gaining admission to USC without something else at play, either their status as athletes or because of affirmative action. 
“Anytime someone sees a tall Black man, they automatically think, ‘Athlete. You only got in because you’re an athlete,’” McGraw said. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Friday, the University said it joined an amicus curiae brief filed by the Association of American Universities in support of Harvard and UNC. 
“As a university community, we have always prized diversity in all of its many forms,” the statement read. “We are preparing as a university for the U.S. Supreme Court decision both to be responsive to the decision and to maintain our commitment to diversity.”
While it remains unclear as to how the Court will decide, Quick said that in the event that affirmative action policies are overturned, he is hopeful USC will continue admitting a diverse class regardless of SCOTUS’ ruling in June. 
“When you look at [USC’s] history, they’ve actually been on the right side of history with these admissions-based decisions,” Quick said. “I think USC will find a way to get around this, and I think that USC will always make sure that, in every single high school classroom where there’s a talented student, that [USC is] appearing as a possibility in that student’s mind.”
Feben Worku, a sophomore majoring in business administration, human biology and communication, said USC would find a way to uphold race-conscious values even if affirmative action policies are overturned, but diversity would still decrease. 
“They’re going to realize they don’t have to meet certain numbers, but I don’t think it’s going to be disregarded completely … I think the number of people of color will get worse and worse, but I don’t think that they’re gonna be like, ‘This is not something we’re considering at all,’” Worku said.
Briana Connors, a sophomore majoring in sociology, said the potential rollback of affirmative action policies at USC would affect non-white prospective students’ incentive to apply to certain universities.
“For incoming juniors or seniors in high school … if they are anything but a white student and they see that there’s not many people who are their race on campus, it’ll definitely discourage them from applying to schools and limit them from opportunities in getting an education that they deserve,” Connors said.
Only time will tell how the Court will rule. But if affirmative action were to be repealed, Connors said, its decision could impact future generations of Trojans, discouraging them from applying to USC.
“If there’s no one around you that looks like you or has [the] same background or experiences that you have, there’s no real motivation for you to enter that environment,” Connors said.
