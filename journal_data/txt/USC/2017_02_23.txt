On a map depicting human trafficking cases reported in 2016, California tops the list. 
The online master of social work program at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work released an interactive website about human trafficking as the second piece of a two-part campaign to spread awareness about the issue. The website provides a place for the public to learn about human trafficking from an educational standpoint.
On Wednesday, the Dworak-Peck School collaborated with Professor Annalisa Enrile to create this resource.
Enrile said she developed her passion for putting an end to human trafficking when she was an undergraduate student in 1993.
“When I first got involved, it was because I heard stories about those who have been labor trafficked,” Enrile said. “My family is from the Philippines, and the number one export of the Philippines is its migrant labor force. For me, there have always been personal components.”
Colleen O’Day, a community manager for the online master of social work program, touched on Ernile’s experience.
“[Enrile] is a leader in the fight against human trafficking,” O’Day said. “She has done a lot of research in the area and is a really great resource, not only for educating about human trafficking but also for how social workers can play a role in ending the practice.”
The new website is the second component of the campaign. The first part of the project was a video titled “Freedom’s Journey: Understanding Human Trafficking,” which was released on Jan. 11, Human Trafficking Awareness Day. According to the video, more than 20 million victims live as modern-day slaves.
Marina Araiza, a student in the masters of social work program, agrees with the website’s intentions.
“I have a passion for the issue of human trafficking,” Araiza said. “I think it’s a major problem in our society, and it’s a global problem,” 
In addition to describing and providing statistics on the issue, the website includes personal stories from survivors, as well as a spotlight on child soldiers. The website’s visuals provide additional information about the human trafficking epidemic. The maps show the different countries that the victims come from, as well as where they end up. 
“One of the most basic things we have to do is educate people on the topic,” Enrile said. “There are a number of different sites that do that, but very few sites have been able to bring all the information together in one place.”
O’Day added that it is important for people to understand the magnitude of the issue because human trafficking is so widespread. 
“It sounds like such a faraway issue — you’re not thinking about it being so common, but people don’t understand just how close to home this hits,” O’Day said. “Our goal is to demonstrate the scope of this issue.”
Araiza said she believes this will be an important resource for the public.
“I think that if we can make something powerful and easy to read, that would be great,” Araiza said. “People don’t have access to resources that are easy to read and to understand.”
Enrile, along with 30 students from the master of social work program, will travel to the Philippines in a few weeks. The group will work with various parts of the government to create innovative ways to solve the human trafficking problem.
“One of the reasons this issue has become so paramount in social work is that social workers are really taking leadership in these area,” Enrile said. “[They] are on the front lines of this.”
The interactive website provides a list of ways that people can get involved in the fight against human trafficking, beginning with education.
“In order to stop it, we always have to make sure it’s at the forefront of people’s consciousness,” Enrile said, “We are hoping to use this platform to move people from awareness to action.”

Virtual clinic visionary · Leslie Saxon, in collaboration with the Institute for Creative Technologies, aims to bring virtual doctors to patients. Kristen Zung | Daily Trojan
Two USC institutes are developing a Virtual Care Clinic to bring the health care system online.
The USC Center for Body Computing and the USC Institute for Creative Technologies collaborated to ensure that patients can access important information about their medical conditions anytime and anywhere. 
Leslie Saxon, the founder and executive director of the Center for Body Computing, first conceived the idea of a Virtual Care Clinic. Saxon, who leads the project, is also the chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at USC. 
“I was inspired by the fact that we have so few highly trained specialists in the world and so many human beings across the world who need access to care,” Saxon said. “If you could just bring this leverage of specialists over a larger population, that would be really amazing.”
Scott Dorman, the managing director at the Center for Body Computing, said the main idea behind the project revolves around supporting each individual according to their needs.
“[Saxon’s] idea and her vision was to develop an entire ecosystem around a patient or a health care consumer that will be virtual,” Dorman said. “A patient or a general health care consumer or really anybody who owns a smartphone will be able to access a virtual doctor 24/7 anytime, anywhere that they choose.” 
Dorman said most patients have the same kinds of general questions about their diet or precautions when they go to a doctor, so the purpose behind the virtual doctor program is for the patient to get basic information from virtual doctors. They can then spend more time asking more important questions unique to their own condition when they physically visit the doctor. Virtual doctors can provide contextualized, high-quality information to the patients whenever they need it.
“This system wouldn’t prescribe you medication or wouldn’t give you a diagnosis,” Dorman said. “The most difficult part is that there are so many different complex layers and pieces to a worthwhile project like this … that we believe can truly change the health care system.” 
Saxon said the goal of this project is to create a global health care system such that doctors will be able to help patients who are at different locations. Patients will feel more empowered and knowledgeable. She emphasized that the Virtual Care Clinic will be especially helpful for those who live with certain chronic diseases, as it will integrate them with their caregivers and doctors and provide them with the right kind of information.
 “As a practicing physician, I want to spend my time on the patients who need me, not on people who don’t require me and who could be cured … digitally,” Saxon said. 
The virtual doctors will provide tailored information based on the patient’s characteristics and where they live, according to Saxon. The virtual doctors can not only talk to patients but also reply with empathy, Saxon said.
Dorman added that the Institute for Creative Technologies plays an important part in the development of this project.
“Our strategic partner is the Institute for Creative Technologies that does all the computer rendering of virtual doctors,” Dorman said. “We are very closely aligned with them on this project, and they are the ones who are responsible for really creating the virtual characters, which may be used for other purposes.”
The Virtual Care Clinic application hopes to provide information in many different languages, so that it can become a global tool.
“We will provide them [with] information that they can then use and hopefully engage in more preventive behavior,” Dorman said. “We just want to try and prevent people from getting to the point where they are suffering with a disease and allowing it to get to such a stage where they require emergency medical care.”

After remaining within striking distance for the majority of the contest, USC had no answer for No. 4 Arizona’s big scoring run midway through the second half. The Wildcats hit seven consecutive shots in the last three minutes of the final period to blow the game wide open.   
Arizona’s second-half scoring kick was too much for the Trojans to handle, as USC (21-7, 8-7) dropped its third consecutive conference game in a 90-77 loss at the McKale Center on Thursday night. 
“We got better this week. We played hard tonight,” head coach Andy Enfield said to the media. “We played well enough offensively we just could not stop them down in the second half.”
A 3-point field goal from sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright pulled the Trojans within a 51-49 deficit of the Wildcats with over 15 minutes remaining in the game.
Arizona (26-3, 15-1) responded with a 20-6 scoring run over the next five minutes of play. The Wildcats extended their lead over USC to 71-55 with 9:36 remaining in the second half. 
A 3-point shot from junior Arizona guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright gave the Wildcats their largest lead of the night at 78-62 with just over five minutes to play. 
“They got rolling on offense,” Enfield said. “It’s hard to guard Arizona when they’re shooting the ball at that level. I give Arizona credit. They really played well on offense [and] shot the ball well.”
As a team, Arizona finished Thursday night shooting 11-for-20 (55 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, the Wildcats shot 32-for-63 (51 percent) from the field against the Trojans. 
Wildcats sophomore guard Allonzo Trier, who finished with a game-high 25 points, hit a 3-point basket at the buzzer to give Arizona a 44-39 halftime lead against the Trojans.
Over the final 6:28 of the first half, Arizona shot 10-of-13 (76.9 percent) from the floor. The Wildcats were able to convert on four 3-point field goals in the final 2:30 of the first half. 
“Arizona did a great job of closing out in the first half,” Enfield said. “They played some great defense against us, too.”
The Trojans attempted to mount a comeback late in regulation, pulling within an 80-73 deficit on a pair of Boatwright field goals with under two minutes left in the game. 
USC had a 20-6 run of its own early on in the first half. With six minutes remaining before the half, the Trojans held a 28-19 lead over Arizona. 
USC finished the game by missing six of its final eight shots taken in regulation, putting the nail in the road loss.
The Trojans suffered a double-digit loss at Arizona’s hands despite shooting 27-for-51 (53 percent) from the field.
USC’s game against Arizona was its third consecutive game against a team ranked in the top six nationally. The Trojans are the only team in the nation this season to go through a three-game stretch in which they played three top-six ranked teams. The Trojans dropped all three of these contests by double digits.
Boatwright led the way for USC offensively, recording a team-high 23 points on 6-for-11 shooting from the floor. He also finished the game shooting 8-for-8 from the free throw line. 
The Trojans committed 14 combined turnovers as a team. Arizona capitalized on USC’s offensive lapses, outscoring the Trojans 23-9 on points off of turnovers. 
USC sophomore forward Chimezie Metu recorded his fifth double-double of the season against Arizona (15 points, 12 rebounds). 
Boatwright and Metu were two of USC’s four double-digit scorers on Thursday. Junior guard Elijah Stewart and freshman guard De’Anthony Melton finished with 13 and 10 points scored, respectively. Melton also recorded a team-high four assists against the Wildcats. 
After completing a dunk with 13:21 minutes left in the second half, Metu landed awkwardly and appeared to suffer a minor ankle injury that forced him to leave the game. After taking a quick trip to the locker room, Metu made a prompt return to the floor to play. He scored nine points after returning to the game with 12 minutes left in play. 
USC will remain in the desert for its final road game of the season against Arizona State (13-15, 6-9) on Sunday. The Trojans will look to avoid their fourth consecutive loss in conference play.

On Wednesday, Budapest withdrew its bid to host the Summer Olympics in 2024, widening the very real possibility of the Games coming to Los Angeles in seven years. With other potential venues such as Boston, Rome, Stockholm and Oslo also bowing out recently, the only other bidder for the Games is Paris.
On the surface, the prospect of hosting the Olympics these days seems to scare constituents rather than excite them. It’s why the 2022 Winter Games will be held in Beijing — a city where it doesn’t really snow — because the only other option was Almaty, Kazakhstan. The International Olympic Committee, which decides the bids, has been accused of corruption and excessive demands from host cities. The cost to host the Games is almost never worth it; every Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget by an average of 156 percent, according to a University of Oxford study. Look at the images of empty, decrepit and abandoned stadiums from past Games — Rio, Sochi, Beijing, Athens — and it’s easy to understand how, for most cities, the Olympics result in a mere three-week economic boon before everyone leaves, the cameras go away and the host country is left in the red.
And on the surface, just the mere thought of the millions of athletes, spectators and media from around the world descending upon Los Angeles for three whole weeks and slowing the world-renowned dreadful traffic from a crawl to a parking lot should be enough to make locals vomit. So, one proper inference to make here for the city would be to let Paris have the Games so we don’t have to deal with either the headache of hosting or the economic heartbreak that presumably follows. 
But in a time where public support for the Olympics in potential host cities is waning rapidly — there was so much backlash in Boston that the city literally struck down its own bid  — the mood in Los Angeles is decidedly different: A Loyola Marymount University poll conducted last year found that more than 88 percent of Angelenos are in favor of hosting the Games in 2024.
OK, so maybe Californians are just objectively cooler. But on top of that, Los Angeles’ bid doesn’t appear to have the same potential missteps as other cities. It seems to be economically sound, low-risk and a true window to bring the Olympics back to the United States for just the second time since Los Angeles last hosted the Summer Games in 1984 (have you ever wondered how Café 84 got its name?)
Given how tarnished the IOC’s reputation has become (see: “doping, Russia”), holding the Olympics in a world-class city with a feasible plan wouldn’t be a bad idea. For most Olympic bidders, their blueprint for the Games revolve around proposals for massive new arenas and plans to build a shining city on a hill from scratch. But for 2024, Los Angeles has a different — and simple — idea. Rather than spending billions to build grandiose stadiums from scratch for the purposes of three weeks of competition, Los Angeles is proposing to use the plethora of venues already at its disposal for the Games.
And there are plenty of them, some of them on or near the USC campus. The Coliseum, fresh off a $270 million renovation project, would hold the opening and closing ceremonies, giving the historical venue — which has opened both the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games — another chance to shine on the world stage. The Galen Center would play host to badminton. Dedeaux Field would turn into a temporary hub for swimming and diving, while the soon-to-be-completed University Village would serve as the media village.
That’s just the USC area. The city intends on utilizing just about every venue suitable for sports in the Southern California region: the Rose Bowl for soccer, the StubHub Center for rugby, the Staples Center and Pauley Pavilion for basketball, the Santa Monica Beach for volleyball. Remember in Sochi in 2014, when athletes and media dealt with contaminated water in their half-built, shoddy rooms? This time around, the athletes’ village would simply be at UCLA. There would be no huge investments, no last-second rush to make sure the stadiums are built on time (as was the case in Rio last summer) because everything’s already there.
In all, the bill for Los Angeles if it were to host the 2024 Games is projected to be just $5.3 billion, which pales in comparison to the $12 billion spent on the Rio Games, the whopping $50 billion spent for Sochi and the $30 billion that Tokyo is projected to spend on the 2020 Summer Olympics.
The Los Angeles proposal definitely isn’t sexy, but that’s not what the IOC needs right now. They don’t need another before-and-after comparison showing how a shiny, sleek, expensive stadium was used for all of three weeks before becoming an unused, glorified hunk of concrete. They don’t need to put the Games in countries plagued with issues far greater than hosting a sporting event — Rio’s budget for the 2016 Games was 16 times higher than the budget to fight the Zika Virus, according to Public Radio International. So while you were watching Michael Phelps end his career on a golden note or Usain Bolt run like the wind, people were dying of Zika because money was being funneled toward making Brazil look good in front of the world instead of fighting the life-threatening virus.
This should never happen, and the IOC needs to come up with a more viable procedure for poorer countries such as Brazil to host the Olympics. For now, it needs a break, a controversy-free Games to rehabilitate its image. And what better place than Los Angeles, a city that is open to welcoming the world to its hospitality and that actually has a reasonable, fiscally responsible plan to pull off a mega-event that no one else seems to want anymore?

After a 12-day break in between games, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team is finally back in action this weekend with a trip down to UC Irvine to participate in the 2017 Barbara Kalbus Invitational.
The Trojans (14-0) are currently riding a 41-game winning streak dating back to the end of the 2015 season and will look to defend the same tournament crown they captured a year ago in Irvine. However, those accomplishments do not mean much for this refreshed USC squad. 
“We’re not thinking about what we’ve done in the past anymore because that was a different team then, and we’re a much different team now,” senior driver Stephania Haralabidis said. “We’re moving forward together and thinking as a new team with many new strengths.”
It has been a while since the Trojans last splashed down in the pool, with their most recent victory coming in the finals of the Triton Invitational in La Jolla two weekends ago. USC relied on their staunch defense in that tournament, racking up four solid wins against three ranked teams. The Trojans were led by junior goalie Victória Chamorro, who recorded 19 saves in just two games. 
For her defensive efforts, the Rio Olympian was honored as the MPSF Player of the Week for the first time in her career on Feb. 14. Chamorro averages 10.5 saves and only 2.5 goals-against per game. Also splitting time in the cage has been sophomore All-American Amanda Longan, who averages 10.8 saves per game and 4.0 goals-against per game. In total, USC’s defense has only allowed 47 goals while amassing 26 scoreless periods on the season.
On the offensive side of things, USC is led by its pair of senior drivers in Stephania and Ioanna Haralabidis, who are first and third on the team with 46 and 26 goals, respectively. Standout freshman utility Maud Megens has also made her mark with 31 goals, good for second on the team, while USC has outscored its opponents by a 259-47 margin so far. In addition, a total of 16 different players on the roster have scored this season, with seven of those players being freshmen.
The 2017 Barbara Kalbus Invitational, formerly known as the UCI Invitational, will feature 16 ranked teams and six of the top seven teams in the MPSF, including No. 1 Stanford, No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 California and No. 5 Arizona State. USC will be joined in group play by No. 7 Hawai’i, No. 11 Pacific and No. 20 Loyola Marymount. The Trojans begin the tournament against the Lions on Friday at 11:15 a.m. PST, and should they come out victorious, a matchup against either the Rainbow Wahine or the Tigers awaits on Saturday at 10:30 a.m. PST for a spot in the tournament semifinals.
While a big slate of games against some top-ranked competition awaits this weekend, the Trojans are not looking to get too far ahead of themselves. 
“We have to think about it as one game at a time at this point,” Ioanna Haralabidis said. “It doesn’t matter where we rank or where other teams rank, we just have to take each game one at a time.”

Mention USC to a non-student, and their first reaction will probably be a reference to the crime-riddled neighborhood around the University. It’s no secret that USC’s position in South Central Los Angeles makes it infamous for crimes like robbery, assault and even homicide. And many take this issue as a reason to remain within the gates of the University, seemingly protected from the outside world. 
USC takes many steps to protect students — and in fact, the University’s crime rates are lower than those of other Pac-12 schools of comparable size, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford University. But individuals must also take responsibility for their own safety — as well as realize that there is more to the University Park neighborhood than crime and danger. 
In 2015, USC students reported 41 sex offenses, 59 cases of robbery (including motor vehicle theft and burglary) and nine incidences of aggravated assault on or near the University Park Campus, according to the Department of Public Safety’s Annual Security Report. Last week, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent out an email memorandum explaining what the University is doing to help promote safety while also urging students to stay aware of their surroundings. 
Just a short walk off campus brings many students face-to-face with the realities of living in a big city, from homelessness to poverty to policing. As the University’s profile has risen, however, administrators have worked to isolate students from the problems that surround them, from putting up a large wrought-iron fence around campus (now complete with neo-Gothic-style entrance spikes) to hiring security personnel wearing yellow jackets to guard the street corners and providing free access to Campus Cruiser and Uber for students. 
Once they arrive at school, most students adjust to its nuanced safety protocol. They receive TrojansAlert messages when potentially dangerous situations occur, have to show ID to enter campus after 9 p.m. and must follow a guest check-in policy that limits the number of non-USC students allowed in USC housing. On-campus housing has also implemented fingerprint scanners to know the exact identity of anyone entering dorm buildings. 
Despite these and other safety measures, persistent armed robberies at ATMs, harassment on the street, petty theft and even murders have forged a culture in which students have become afraid of venturing out past the barriers of their school at night. While we cannot allow these perceptions and experiences to restrict our experiences at USC, we also cannot fail to take some collective responsibility for our own safety. As suggested in Carry’s memorandum, students should keep their phones and other valuable items put away while they are walking down the streets outside campus, and should always stay alert and aware of what is going on around them. This can be as simple as looking up instead of texting while walking.
Furthermore, USC must continue and expand its concern for students’ safety. For example, while the presence of security guards in yellow jackets may perpetuate feelings of safety, yellow jackets are not technically obligated to intervene in situations where students are attacked; they are only obligated to report incidents. Such policies are worth reconsidering, but more importantly, students should be further educated about safety protocol on and around USC so there is transparency and false assumptions do not result in dangerous situations.
That being said, fear of USC’s surroundings should not lead to students isolating themselves on campus. One way to amend the situation at hand is to establish bridges between ourselves — the student body — and the community around us. Numerous programs at USC, such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative and Joint Education Program, connect students with youth at local schools as tutors and mentors. Other programs, such as USC Share a Meal, connect students with the local homeless community through distributing meals and other supplies to homeless individuals. 
We cannot allow ourselves to disengage from the vibrant community that surrounds us because of exaggerated stereotypes and paranoia. Like students at all universities across the nation, we cannot be careless when walking down streets alone after dark. We must be mindful of our surroundings, and we should avoid placing ourselves in compromising situations. 
But caution and community engagement are not mutually exclusive. To choose not to involve ourselves with the people and places around campus would shortchange our college experiences.

Political involvement is the key to political achievement of any kind. It’s true for both Democrats and Republicans. That’s why this week, I’m headed up to Sacramento to join the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics for the John Cerrell Sacramento Seminar in Political Leadership, a bipartisan involvement and networking program at the state capital.
As an Unruh associate, I’ve heard many young people bemoan the current state of our partisan political affairs, especially since November. Often, the qualms of polarization, ineffectuality and stagnation are valid and true. However, if you want to speak on Congress, it might benefit you to explore Congress — or any other governing body. How our legislature functions and politicians interact is certainly a more beneficial lesson to learn than how to complain about your perception of their conflict. Understanding the mechanics will work wonders when trying to understand the result. 
Last week, a plethora of self-righteous  conservatives and a few misguided liberals began sharing around the internet a video of Sen. Marco Rubio trashing what he considered to be the unsportsmanlike, impolite nature of senatorial relations within the chamber. He added, ignorantly, that there are some governing bodies, like those in the United Kingdom, that scream and yell at one another, and that the U.S. Senate was quickly headed to that same uncouth Armageddon of — gasp! — shouting. However, Rubio was missing something– in addition, of course, to a fantastical Republican National Convention nomination. He failed to understand how those foreign governing bodies really relate to each other and what those relations actually mean for the brunt of their national politics. While parliaments do certainly scream and yell, they also churn out twice the meaningful and productive legislation that the U.S. Congress does, and they lack the type of vitriolic partisan politics that characterizes this country. Sometimes, they even do their jobs as prescribed by national law; perhaps they would have even considered Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court. They may get loud, but what Rubio didn’t realize was that their shouting was actually a more effective means of parliamentary debate than our joyous brand of not showing up to vote, and/or freezing the government when we don’t get our way. Rubio didn’t understand the U.K. and Scottish Parliaments. How many Americans truly understand our own Congress?
And as with anything, it begins locally. I still believe that anyone with a political consciousness should intern in politics at least once in their lives, be it with a politician, a lobbyist or a single-issue organization. The opportunity to embark on a program like Cerrell is meaningful in several ways — not only to open doors to a future in politics, but also to understand what that political system really entails. This might be the land of opportunity and American dreams, but high politics is often a closed-shop industry. Most constituents are on the outside looking in — and can we really know if what we see is all that accurate to what it’s like to legislate? How are these men and women thinking, what must they consider and what are the real relations between them and the other side — sans the hype of partisan media and the popular American addiction to conflict? After all, multiple national lawmakers have said that House of Cards comes closer to representing their daily toil than the reporting that is done on the results, which, to be clear, is also important. American politics might be a bit easier to affect, and to change, if most Americans and young, educated people especially sought to understand the business of lawmaking.
It’s a simple idea, but I think it could take us far. That being said, I encourage anyone interested to pursue an exploration of the bodies that govern them — what you find might surprise you.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Turkey Dump is a term we threw around as college freshmen to describe the distinct phenomenon of high school sweethearts breaking up over Thanksgiving break. I watched Hallie and her boyfriend in Santa Barbara crash and burn a few weeks before, and Liv dumped her boyfriend from Oregon a few weeks before that. Then, as break rolled around, I kept a checklist in my head of the other relationships that failed. This crude checklist distanced me from them and helped keep me from acknowledging the bizarre nature of my early college romantic life.
Hank and I broke up two hours before I left on my cross-country flight to USC. 
We had decided not to do long distance between our two schools in May but to stay together over the summer. Our last date was meticulously planned: dinner, a slam poetry show, my favorite ice cream in Boston, a visit to our alma mater (where Hank handed me a present and a love letter) and (of course) car sex. Then, at 2 a.m., he dropped me off at my front door, gave me a kiss and said goodbye. 
I was jittery and exhausted and started move-in the next day with a smile on my face. And despite the fact that I still had bruises on the back of my head from our last night of intimacy, and that Hank still texted me, “I love you,” I mixed the occasional tears with a desperate quest to win the breakup.
One morning, around the time Thanksgiving rolled around, and I was 10 kisses into my rebound, Hank had sent me a text that said, “‘I guess I should stop saying ‘I love you.’” Ours was my first real relationship, and I had wanted to believe that a breakup didn’t have to mean you let go of the emotional connection. It was my first love, and I wanted to think that first love was an indefinite bond. 
My first semester, I danced between idealistically clinging to romanticism and plunging headfirst into the chaos of USC hookup culture.
Hank and I had six months of an unlabeled but naive physical relationship before we became boyfriend and girlfriend. Because of this, I thought I knew how to navigate hookups. I waited until I was in love to have sex for the first time, and I fell deeply in love with Hank. Once that was over with, and Hank was thousands of miles away, I thought I would tap into my sexuality as a large part of my exploration of college social life.
I never had a full drink before USC. I lied on AlcoholEdu because the statistics made me feel like an anomaly. On the first Friday before classes, I walked far off campus and had a boy recommend me a drink at a party’s bar. I quickly consumed that rum and Coke and then a vodka Sprite. The next weekend, I got drunk enough that I peed in a driveway. 
By the end of the semester, I had established a tongue-in-cheek rule that I dubbed sex or chicken nuggets: When I went out, I would either end the night with a boy or at a fast food restaurant. By the end of the semester, I wasn’t any closer to being a woman than I was that night in a steamy car with my head banging against the side door, hoping time would stop.
Yet I desperately clung to the notion that the diverse parade of boys I encountered my first semester here — the ROTC Midwestern blonde, the Nicaraguan engineer, the older film student, the friend-of-a-friend — was leading me on a path towards the ideal college experience.
During college counseling at my high school, we were fed the notion that we would all find the right fit. With this, we would not only find exceptional academic compatibility, but also a social life tailor-made for us. 
USC did not satisfy me intellectually my first semester; it took a change of major, a couple transfer applications and a new group of friends to finally find this. Before I figured out I needed to make these changes, however, I compensated my academic dissatisfaction with social interactions fit for a college movie. These decisions were amplified by my recent heartbreak over a boy who still texted me every morning and every night.
I do not regret the choices I made when I got here. I got some rebellion out of my system and made memories that still make me laugh when I tell them to people for the first time. But I wish I could have been more aware of the calculations I was making that led me to these boys. Hank’s distance would not hurt less if I had a rotation of boys in my bed. It kept hurting. And the party school would not become the right place for me if I became the life of the party. It took more than that.

Please be aware of the statistics everyone who is reading this. Only about 23% of females ages 18-25 have had more than 5 sexual partners. About 19% have never had a sexual partner and about 58% have had 1-5 partners. So this author’s sexual history is not representative of the average female USC student.

As a Texas native, I am used to eating tacos once or twice a week. At home in Houston, I knew the best small, breakfast taco shops and more upscale lunch and dinner taco spots. Since moving out to Los Angeles for college, I have eaten less tacos. Los Angeles is brimming with eateries serving delicious, authentic Mexican food. The problem is I never know which is the best. So, with some research and recommendations from friends, I have compiled a list of must-try taco spots in the city. One shop on this list is guaranteed to satisfy you, no matter what type of taco you like. 

Photo from Serious EatsTacos Tamix
If you like cheap, authentic tacos, this is your place. It’s hard to get a cheaper meal than this. Each taco is only $1.25 and they come with unlimited salsa, grilled onions and chilis. One of their most popular tacos is the Al Pastor, which is tender and seasoned to perfection. If that’s not enough to sway you, this taco truck is parked extremely close to USC. It’s located at the Mobil gas station on Hoover street. Tacos Tamix is open until 2 a.m., so it is the perfect spot for a late-night snack as well.

Guisados
If handmade tortillas and spicy green salsa are your thing, give Guisados a try. Frequent customers claim that this restaurant serves the best taco in Los Angeles. It was even featured by LA Eater as a must-try taco joint. One unique offering is the sampler plate, which allows customers to try six of the most popular tacos. Some of their most popular tacos include the Steak and Chorizo. Looking for something lighter? Guisados also offers shrimp and fish options.

B.S. Taqueria
The fun, vibrant decorations at this taqueria keep customers coming back for more. B.S. Taqueria sells delicious tacos, churros and drinks. They have an extensive menu that satisfies anything from meat lovers to vegetarians. Popular items include the chicken and fried fish tacos. However, some claim the churros are the best item on the menu. Customers swear by the B.S. Taqueria churros that melt in your mouth.

Loqui
While Loqui is located a little far from USC in Culver City, it’s worth the short drive or metro ride. Loqui is a trendy restaurant located in the Platform, an innovative shopping center right off the metro stop in Culver City. Their popular taco flavors include shredded chicken, shredded pork and shredded beef. They also offer taco bowls filled with cheese, onions and salsa. If you are looking for a crossover between traditional and contemporary tacos, this is your place.

Ricky’s Fish Tacos 
Many people claim Ricky’s serves the best fish tacos in Los Angeles. They use fresh fish and quality ingredients to prepare fish tacos that blow away the competition. Their tacos are topped with chopped cabbage, pico de gallo and tangy crema. They also offer a variety of housemade salsas to amp up the flavor of your tacos.

Let’s break down the activities of a hypothetical USC student in a week: 18 hours of class, at least 10 hours of studying, 10 hours of part-time work, 15 hours of internship, 12 hours of commuting and six hours of extracurricular activities and volunteering.
That is a lot of time we spend at school. After a rigorous week, often in the weekends all we want to do is lie down in bed and laze around all day. Thoughts of traveling and exploring Los Angeles, this beautiful city we live in, are swept to the sidelines. Netflix is more economical, we say. It saves more time for us to rest.
While it’s good to take a step back and relax, we also need to embark on adventures once in a while. We may be discouraged because of lack of time and money, but the one of the beauty of Los Angeles (and I may even say the United States in general) is how accessible and inexpensive it is, if we know how to handle our resources.
Alysta Lim | Daily Trojan
My sister and I travel a lot. People often ask how we manage to slip in a few days of traveling in between our school and work. Our answer: planning. Rigorous, extensive planning. We look at the calendar for a particular school year the moment it becomes available on the Internet. We pick long weekends and school holidays (spring break or the wonderful three-month summer holiday) to travel. We talk with our work supervisors and internship coordinators to make sure that we would be able to go. Plans are always going to change, but just knowing that there is a window of five days here, a week there… That’s enough.
Planning also works wonders in determining how much you need for a particular trip. Airbnb and other online rental sites are lifesavers. Plane tickets, if booked a month in advance, is much cheaper (go earlier than that, however, and you may risk a higher price). Talk with people who have visited where you wanted to go. Then, set a daily budget for yourself — and start saving!
Alysta Lim | Daily Trojan
 People often ask how I find the energy to plan, pack my suitcase and travel in the middle of all of these student responsibilities. In the end I think it all boils down to one thing: passion.
We all love watching travel shows and reading travel blogs. We love scrolling down Instagram, marveling at the beautiful pictures that people take in different parts of the world. We dream of the time we can drop everything in the bat of an eye and travel the world. But with all the responsibilities we now have and continue to add, it’s unlikely that we will find the right time.
If you find yourself postponing that trip you’ve always wanted to take, let me share a little secret that always helps me find the courage to do it. Make an itinerary for yourself. It doesn’t matter if you don’t know when you’ll be able to go, where you’ll stay or where you’ll find the money to fund the trip — make that itinerary.
Alysta Lim | Daily Trojan
Once you do, you’ll find that it’s not as impossible as you previously thought. True, it will still be challenging, but remember that white sandy beach, that camping ground in the desert, that snowy mountaintop or whatever it is that you desire. Keep that picture in your mind and persevere, and who knows? Maybe in a month or two you’ll find yourself exactly where you’ve always wanted to be.

The night before taking a midterm exam, students often contemplate whether it would be more beneficial for them to sleep or stay up all night studying. In my personal experience, I have noticed that most of my friends choose to pull an all-nighter the night before an exam in order to study. They spend the entire night and early morning in the library, rereading their lecture notes and memorizing stacks of flashcards. When they begin to feel tired, they caffeinate themselves or swallow another Adderall pill in hopes of re-energizing themselves. By the time it is exam time, 8 a.m., they have filtered through so much material that they are definitely ready to ace their test. Right? 
What does pulling an all-nighter the night before an important exam really do to your body and mind?
It makes your brain dysfunctional
According to various studies, each hour of sleep someone sacrifices under the suggested number of sleeping hours — about seven hours — results in the loss of brain efficiency. Sacrificing all seven hours of sleep that one needs to function normally will cause one’s brain to be dysfunctional, ultimately resulting in a decrease in performance. Staying up all night will make your body tired and your mind tired. Essentially, according to a UCLA study, “sacrificing sleep for extra study time, whether it’s cramming for a test or plowing through a pile of homework, is actually counterproductive. If a student sacrifices sleep in order to study more than usual, he or she is likely to have more academic problems, not less, on the following day.”
It activates your short-term memory
This might sound like a good thing; after all you only need to remember this information for the upcoming exam right? Think again. According to research from the Texas A&M College of Medicine, the information retained in one’s short-term memory as a result of cramming “disappears within a period of a few minutes to a few hours. It doesn’t allow information to assimilate from short-term to long-term memory.” So, all of the time you spent that night memorizing various scientific terms and such could ultimately be pointless. 
With that being said, studying is extremely important in regards to academic achievement. Experts suggest that in order to retain the necessary information for an important test or exam, one should study during the day over a period of multiple days. Experts also stress that it is important to take breaks every hour or two while studying.
As a student, I have had my share of late night study sessions in the library. I actually pulled my first all-nighter two days ago. I had seen my friends do it over and over again and hoped that it would help prepare me for my test. However, the following day, I felt extremely tired for my exam and my brain felt foggy. I also did not feel entirely prepared for my test. As a result of my personal experience and the research cited above, I advise you to to always choose necessary sleep over studying. Better yet, study during the day so that at night you can sleep guilt-free.

There is a saying that today’s generation eats with their cameras first and stomachs second. For a place that leaves both beyond satisfied, one would have to look no further than the recently opened P.Y.T. Restaurant, which is No. 3 on Eater L.A.’s list of The 22 Hottest Restaurants in Los Angeles this month.
Upon walking in the doors to this eco-chic eatery located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, diners are greeted by beaming , friendly faces eager to swiftly seat them. Despite this, it’s tough to ignore that the size of the room itself is on the smaller side and can get noisy fairly rapidly. Though  a tad stuffy, the atmosphere is still made charming by the fairy lights that drape from the ceiling, hanging above the mosaic-tiled floor, wooden tables, chairs and the plethora of plants and succulents that line the walls.
Adhering to its botanical theme, the restaurant’s menu is mostly vegetarian, inspired by locally grown produce. While this lack of meat may throw many off at first, one glance at the menu would be more than enough to see that there is no shortage of delicious dishes to choose from. Though the foundation of the menu is similar  to almost every other vegetarian restaurant out there, there is not a single conventional item on it. 
Chef Josef Centeno creates intricate blends of flavorful ingredients to turn the most basic dishes — like salads, soups and pastas — into edible masterpieces. With a swift glance over the menu, certain item names would immediately pique a guest’s attention: romanesco and watermelon salad with blood orange, habanero and crème fraiche, salt-baked turnip in hoja santa with French feta, walnut and pea pesto, ricotta cavatelli with yogurt, nori, pecorino, mushroom dashi and sesame and much more. 
The dinner menu prices vary from $12 to $18 for appetizers and main courses — excluding the two meat dishes, which are $21 and $39 — but are undoubtedly worth the cost.
P.Y.T.’s classic starter is the potato chapati bread with a choice of roasted garlic and eggplant dip, coconut butter or heirloom bean hummus with sunflower seed tahini. However, if one is feeling adventurous, there is the option to select all three.
The warm and soft bread is filled with vibrant flavors that puts homemade Indian chapatis (a flat pancake-like tortilla) to shame. Each of these unique dips creates distinct and equally unbelievable sensations of taste: One’s taste buds are sure to fall in love with every single bite.
For the main courses, P.Y.T.’s waiters highly recommended some of their most popular dishes: roasted Japanese sweet potato with Fuji apples and nori butter, a delectable sweet and savory combination that fuses into explosive flavors, and the hand-torn pasta with shishito cream, yuzu, brown butter cilantro and mint. While still excellent, this pasta doesn’t quite meet the extraordinary standard all the other dishes provide.
Last, but not certainly not least, in the meal come the desserts. P.Y.T. offers a small dessert menu of five dishes. The “must-tries” on the menu are the apple croiss’innamon and the coconut tapioca pudding — two of their most delicious and aesthetically pleasing items.
The friendliness of the staff enhances the dining experience in addition to the exceptional food. The staff circles the restaurant with smiles, attempting to make genuine conversation with every customer. The bartender can be seen chatting and laughing with the diners on the bar stools, while making drinks and grooving along to old-school classics and the pop hits that play softly from the speakers.
As a place where guests can treat themselves and their Instagram feed, P.Y.T. is nothing but a win. It is located on 400 S. Main St. and is open every day, except Mondays.

Jason Rhoades lived in Los Angeles for most of his career, but during his lifetime he gained more popularity in Europe and New York than on the West Coast.
A new art exhibit honoring Rhoades opened this past weekend at the Hauser Wirth & Schimmel Los Angeles gallery. The installation, titled Jason Rhoades Installations 1994-2006, showcases major work that spans the artist’s career. 
 This is why the exhibit at Hauser Wirth & Schimmel is important: It is an overdue collection of some of his great works in the town that he called home. 
Rhoades studied at the California College of Arts and Crafts, San Francisco Art Institute and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture before receiving his masters of fine arts at UCLA. He died in 2006, but found critical acclaim as an artist during his lifetime. As seen in the show, his pieces often deal with provocative and bold themes like capitalism, sexuality and consumerism. 
The industrial space was packed with art admirers from the L.A. area on opening night. Walking into the gallery of Rhoades’ work is a jaw-dropping experience, as he uses dazzling and mesmerizing elements in his work, such as bright neon signs. 
Rarely do such pieces make effective use of gallery space and explicit statements. One of the major displays, “Tijuanatanjierchandelier,” had neon signs of Spanish and English slang words for female genitalia hanging above a collection of trinkets from Tijuana, Mexico and Tangier, Morocco. The mixture of cultural goods within the exhibit highlights the sometimes disrespectful aspects of consumerism that appropriates other cultures, and the neon signs appeared to criticize the glamorous nature of the commercialization of sex and the world in general.
Much of Rhoades’ artwork is made of a combination of everyday items. These objects were arranged in large-scale pieces; yet, all the pieces also contained intricate details when scrutinized up close. This is an especially interesting element of Rhoades’ work: He asks us to pay attention and be shocked by his grandiose exposure of our society, while simultaneously encouraging close inspection and detailed reflection. 
“A decade after his death and in a moment of heightened political tension,” the gallery’s official description of the exhibit noted, “Jason Rhoades’s radical oeuvre is more relevant than ever. From religion, commerce, sex and racial and gender stereotypes, to the role of the artist himself, no subject was off-limits and taboo was embraced.”
Rhoades walks a fine line between his work — contributing to sensationalism rather than criticizing it — and received criticisms throughout his career. Nevertheless, this sensationalist criticism toward Rhoades has its validity; there were hundreds of people wrapped around the gallery, trying to get Instagram pictures of the glowing artwork.
The exhibit contains six pieces throughout the artist’s lifespan; they are arranged in the separate galleries of Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, which is a former grain mill-turned-art gallery in the Arts District. The Jason Rhoades installation is on display from Feb. 18 until May 21 and is free to the public.

The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra’s Westside Connections series will showcase Music: The Mirror of Time at Santa Monica’s Moss Theatre on Thursday. The Orchestra will begin the series with an exploration of British composition, featuring Bernadene Blaha, an associate professor of practice of keyboard studies at USC Thornton. 
Bernadene Blaha | Daily Trojan
The larger of the two pieces is by Edward Elgar. Written in 1918 while in Brinkwells, the composer found inspiration from the beautiful forest setting. 
“You can hear that in the writing of it, the music is kind of really dense. In that regard it’s a mirror in time, and the imagery he uses and portrays,” said Blaha. “He spent a good part of a year really in this cottage he and his wife went to and wrote some of the most important chamber music. It was an incredibly inspiring environment for him to be in.”
The second piece is written by Andrew Norman, known for his blend of eclectic sounds and often nonlinear story telling. His work has been recognized in recent years, earning him numerous awards, including Music America’s 2017 composer of the year. 
Working on the composition faculty at USC, Norman is a colleague of Blaha’s. He also was a student of hers not long ago in one of her classes.
“Andrew’s piece is short, about a 10-minute work, and it’s a collection of five sonnets. They’re really creative in the way that he uses the instruments,” Blaha said. “In Andrew’s notes, these are miniatures for sure. He calls them ‘micropieces,’ and he uses the term ‘sonnets’ or coming from the Italian word sonetto, meaning ‘little songs’ or ‘little sounds.’ Each of his five sonnets take as its title a fragment from a Shakespeare sonnet.”
Blaha finds the way Norman manipulates each instrument to have a distinct sound particularly intriguing.
“He writes really different sounds for the cello and piano, it’s very creative in the way he uses the instrument,” Blaha said. “I think for the listener listening too it’s very imaginative. He’s able to capture these little fragments or snippets of time.” 
Preparing for the concert comes down to being able to get into a pace with the other musicians and compare their interpretations. 
“The preparation takes place with the musicians who I’m collaborating with,” Blaha said. “The process of working together and studying that music and coming to interpretation that comes from the entire group that collaboration has a lot to do with the preparation.”
Each player comes into the piece with their own background and knowledge, creating a different experience by simply switching the people in the orchestra.
“Some of us would have played the Elgar quintet before, and just by changing the partners and having everybody bring their thoughts and interpretations to the rehearsal, that helps shape this performance,” Blaha said. “Really, everything is coming from the music that we see in front of us, the way we read the score, and the way we work with each other.”
One way to engage the piece is to follow the directions of the composer. While in many cases the composer is deceased, with this particular concert the instrumentalists have the opportunity to interact with one of the composers directly.
“One of the most interesting aspects for me is that tomorrow we have a rehearsal with Andrew. For musicians it’s always a real thrill when the composer is living and you’re able to meet with them and have their input to the preparation, that’s particularly exciting,” Blaha said. 
For the Elgar piece, and others that make it impossible to have the composer present, there are other ways of being able to follow their intent.
“In a sense they are there through the way they mark the music and the notes or indications that they leave for us, and of course we call them interpretation as we look at the marks that are in the score and we work out what we the performer think that means,” Blaha said. “We try to honor the text and make the music come to life through honoring the composer’s intentions.”
In order to make the composer’s vision come to life, a copious amount of fine-tuning is necessary. This process is often time consuming, and with most musicians taking on multiple projects at once, it can often present the greatest challenge. 
“It certainly isn’t a nine to five calendar – it’s full time. I think we as performers live with the preparation process around the clock,” Blaha said. “Each one of us in the quintet has not only this concert coming up, but has other concerts we’re rehearsing for, other work that we’re doing which includes teaching orchestra performance for them.”
In addition to an engagement in San Francisco the week after the concert, Blaha also has to juggle her responsibilities as a teacher. 
“As far as the teaching goes, that’s an incredible commitment because most of my work is one-on-one private instruction, and so each student has their own program of study that they’re trying to do, their own music that they’re trying to prepare. Each one is different,” Blaha said. “There is no set curriculum for each student, so it takes quite a bit of time to get to know them to understand wherethe challenges and issues and progress and talent lie. It’s completely rewarding, and exhausting.”
Ultimately, being able to work with the other string players and Norman is worth the exhaustion. 
“The most exciting part of it for me is to work with the string players I’ll be working with, who are all in the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. They’re incredible. I’m really enjoying the rehearsing aspect and looking forward definitely to Thursday night’s concert. The work on Andrew Norman’s piece especially, being able to play a composer I’ve known for a couple of years, that’s particularly exciting.”

Standing in the international terminal of LAX saying goodbye to my family before I boarded a plane to Auckland, New Zealand, there were words of comfort and encouragement. One thing that particularly stuck out to me was my mom telling me how brave I was for deciding to do this. I didn’t really understand what she meant at the time.
Now, less than two weeks into my five-month-long journey, I’ve got the idea. I knew that I would learn a lot about myself during my time abroad, but I didn’t realize how quickly the lessons would start, and the first lesson I’ve learned is without a doubt, how important it is to be brave and how brave I have become when I needed to most. I was very comfortable with my life at USC, and I still shock myself when I realize what a big shake-up I willingly put myself through.
In just this short time though, I’ve adjusted and begun to thrive. At the beginning of any new experience, there is a learning curve. The curve when you decide to move to a different hemisphere is just a little larger than when you decide to take up a new hobby.
Within the first week I had been further south on the globe than I’ve ever been before; seen fjords, rivers and volcanoes; and traversed through the terrain where Lord of the Rings was filmed. How many people can say that about their February?

As I was reflecting on my move to a new city a couple days ago, I also realized that I was starting to understand what my mom meant when she said she was proud of how brave I was. It takes a lot of guts to leave everything you know and love to embark on what you are hoping will be the adventure of the lifetime, but hey, as with anything in life — there are no guarantees.
However, as most would assume with study abroad, it has been wonderful. The opportunity to see a different part of the world is humbling, and every time I look at a map to see where I am in relation with where other people are, I’m astounded. It does take a lot of bravery to get on a plane and go somewhere new, but it doesn’t stop there. It takes a lot of bravery to get up each morning and commit to having a new adventure.

At the beginning it was scary to head out into the city on a quest for shampoo or sunscreen, let alone trying to find groceries or somewhere to eat dinner. But you learn much more quickly than you think you will. From feeling helplessly lost and culture-shocked on my first night here, to now confidently traversing the city looking for new places to eat and neighborhoods to check out, I have become much more brave than I realized I could.
Even though every day hasn’t been jammed with once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, the overall experience is just that. Wanting to make the most of my time here has been what I’ve found to push me the most. I want to be brave and go out and explore, because that is what I set out to do. I am here to learn more about the world, but also more about myself, and I can only imagine what four more months here will bring when I’ve already pushed myself so much in the first two weeks.

Most of us are aware that sugar (defined, in this case, as refined or added sugar) is far from ideal for our health. However, the extent to just how badly refined sugar affects our health (mental, emotional, physical) is vastly and scarily unknown.
I’m not going to go into the physical effects of sugar here and now (although you can read all about it here, here and here… for a start) — instead, we’re going to focus on addiction.
When we consume sugar, our brain receptors fire up, particularly in our cerebral cortex, which in turn alerts our “reward system.” Other things that fire up this part of our brain include sex, drugs and social contact. This essentially means that, chemically, consuming sugar causes a release in dopamine, thereby telling our body to continue consuming sugar again, and again.
Addiction to sugar is  chemically and biologically indisputable. In fact, studies in rats have shown that sugar activates the brain more than cocaine does. Results in humans are staggeringly similar.
The receptors in our brain are not, however, the only receptors that sugar manipulates. After we consume sugary foods, the foods naturally travel down towards our stomach. Within our stomach are receptors that tell our brains when we’re full, when to stop eating, and whether we are in need of any more insulin in order to regulate our blood sugar levels. Sugar, however, prevents our brains from truly knowing when we are full; it masks our ability to detect our own satiation, making it far easier to overeat.
In America (and realistically, most of the world sugar dominates our diet more than we care to acknowledge. Some different names for sugar on food labels include glucose, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, maltose, lactose, starch and dextrose. In fact, there’s approximately 61 different names on food labels in America, all of which are essentially the same thing: refined sugar.
But how do we avoid sugar? Most of us are also aware that sugar is in everything, and by everything, I mean everything: bread, pasta sauce, sushi, low-fat yogurt, milk, canned soups, canned baked beans, salad dressing, flavored oatmeal, granola bars… The list is endless.
The trick to “quitting sugar” (because yes, quitting sugar is often as difficult as quitting smoking or other drugs) lies less in avoiding the sugar — although that’s a key part — and more in reducing your desires and craving for sugary sweet tastes every day.






At the end of the day, quitting sugar is going to be difficult. Nobody can deny that. However, once you realize that the rewards for fighting through that difficulty far outweigh the long-term consequences of keeping sugar as a part of your lifestyle, you will be successful. It all comes down to you.
For more information about the effects of sugar, you can read about it here. Or you can watch the following documentaries: That Sugar Film, Fed Up, Sugar Coated, Hungry for Change, The Price of Sugar.

On Thursday, the Trojans (21-6, 8-6) finish a brutal stretch of three games against top-six opponents at No. 4 Arizona (25-3, 14-1). The Trojans lost the first two games against Oregon and UCLA by a combined total of 43 points.
“The losses are growing pains,” sophomore Shaqquan Aaron said. “We can watch film and learn from our mistakes and get better.”
His team has struggled mightily from the field recently, but his confidence in the team does not wane. Aaron believes that his team will peak in the postseason. The Trojans, one of the streakiest teams in the Pac-12, have had no hot shooters of late.
Against Oregon and UCLA, the team shot 33 percent from the floor and under 30 percent from 3-point range.
With so many sharpshooters on  the roster — Aaron, junior Elijah Stewart, sophomore Bennie Boatwright, junior Jordan McLaughlin and freshman Jonah Mathews — plus sophomore Chimezie Metu down low, it is difficult to imagine that no one has made the big shots in the last two games. Based on their play this season, it appears the team feasts and famines together.
“We got to keep pushing,” freshman Jonah Mathews said on the season nearing an end. “Keep on grinding.”
In their first matchup with Arizona, USC fell behind by 20 points before Stewart got red hot in the second half only for the team to fall short of a comeback. To win at Arizona, more than one of them — perhaps all of the playmakers — will have to ditch their woes and start making shots. That will be easier said than done, though, against one of the stingiest defenses in basketball. The Wildcats allow a paltry 63.5 points per game.
Since losing to Oregon on the road in early February, the Wildcats have won four straight games, but three were by single digits. Seldom do they lose at the McKale Center. Dating back to last season, they have won 20 consecutive contests at home and seven straight versus the Trojans.
“We’re 10-3 on the road this year,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “That’s pretty good. Last year the top four [Pac-12] teams went 94-6 at home. We were one of those teams.”
Although the Wildcats rank eighth in the Pac-12 in points per game, they have five players averaging double-digits plus a sixth at 9.5 points per game. Freshman forward Lauri Markkanen remains the centerpiece of head coach Sean Miller’s strategy. The seven-footer causes mismatches for every opponent that he is matched up against.
A contender for Pac-12 Player of the Year, Markkanen averages 15.7 points and 7.5 rebounds. He shoots 45.7 percent from three and 83.9 percent from the free throw line. At the Galen Center, he dropped 23 points, picked up eight rebounds and made five 3-point shots in Arizona’s 73-66 win.
The Trojans will look to shut down Markkanen while battling against the Wildcats’ rigorous defense to chip out their place in the Pac-12 before the conference tournament begins.

I hate to say it, but there was an air of inevitability to the precarious position USC men’s basketball finds itself in today. Riding a five-game winning streak in early February, USC prepared to run the gauntlet: The Trojans would have to play three top-10 opponents consecutively in Oregon, UCLA and Arizona, with two of those games coming on the road.
Now, after losses to the Ducks and Bruins, here we are. The momentum from USC’s unbeaten run and its first game against UCLA appears all but spent, and a Trojan team that seemed set to peak in March now looks in danger of limping into the postseason. There are only four games left before USC heads for Las Vegas to take on the rest of the Pac-12, and little time remains to impress heading into tournament season.
It’s unlikely that head coach Andy Enfield’s squad will enjoy a reversal of fortune against No. 4 Arizona tonight, with the Wildcats owning one of the most formidable home-court advantages in college basketball (they are undefeated at the McKale Center this season and have lost just one home game in the last four years). Freshman phenom Lauri Markkanen dominated at the Galen Center when USC fell to Arizona in January, and the Trojans will now also have to contain dynamic guard Allonzo Trier, who was suspended during the first game.
Enfield may look to the Bay Area for inspiration, as Stanford and Cal both played the Wildcats close in Tucson a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, neither the Cardinal nor the Bears exposed any sort of blueprint to topping Arizona. Both deployed zone defenses, which the Wildcats struggled against this season, but that hasn’t been enough to win at the McKale Center. Arizona even overcame single-digit scoring from Markkanen en route to beating Stanford and Cal — and Trier only put up three points against the Bears. The Wildcats still came away with a pair of wins.
Maybe we need to be pessimistic about USC’s prospects tonight — but surely the rebound will come when the Trojans take on middling Arizona State on Sunday, right? It may not be so simple: The Sun Devils made USC sweat when they came to Los Angeles, pulling to within one possession by the end of the game, and they will be even tougher customers at the Wells Fargo Arena where they are 8-5 on the season (13-15 overall). It is not at all out of the question that Enfield and company will return to campus trying to break out of a four-game losing streak.
Given their recent form, the Trojans have likely crushed any fan’s pipe dream of a national championship (unless they pull off a crazy upset against Arizona): The team simply doesn’t seem capable of hitting its top gear outside of the Galen Center. But in the right conditions — namely being at home — USC has shown the ability keep pace with any national titan, and that can’t be dismissed. The program continues to take massive strides with Enfield, and establishing the Galen Center as a fortress is huge for its long-term future and identity. After all, can you name one championship contender that isn’t nearly unbeatable on its home court? The Trojans made progress away from Los Angeles this year, too, notching the first road sweep in Enfield’s USC career in Washington earlier this month.
Enfield has also proven his ability to develop players: Redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron has blossomed in his first eligible season since transferring from Louisville, and sophomore forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright have become more imposing threats on both ends of the court during their second year at Troy. Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton has seized a significant role after his early-season impact; junior guard Jordan McLaughlin remains the team’s heart and soul. And all of these players will return to USC next fall, ready to take another step forward.
Yes, we have endured a frustrating penultimate week of the regular season, and this year will probably end in disappointment for Trojan fans. But it’s a minor miracle that we even have a team with high expectations. When Enfield took over in 2013, USC couldn’t buy a conference win, let alone one on the road. Now we have a nationally relevant program that has ambitions to progress in the NCAA Tournament.
When the Trojans take the court tonight, we might see a bloodbath as Trier and Markkanen slice the USC zone to ribbons. But even if that happens, we can watch with a strange sense of optimism. Because come this time next year, Markkanen will be in the NBA — and Trier could be gone with him. Over in Westwood, the Bruins will have to deal with the departures of Lonzo Ball and TJ Leaf.
For USC, though? McLaughlin, Metu, Boatwright, Aaron, Melton and company will likely all remain Trojans in a depleted Pac-12. Maybe that is when the championship window will finally swing open. It took Theo Epstein five years to shepherd the Chicago Cubs to the Promised Land. Hopefully Enfield’s fifth season at USC will yield similar results.

Following a heart-wrenching overtime 11-10 victory against Northwestern, the No. 3 USC women’s lacrosse team hits the road facing No. 4 Florida on Friday at 6:30 p.m. EST and Stetson on Sunday at 12 p.m. EST. For the Trojans, this marks their first games that they’ve played in the state of Florida as well as their first time playing a top five opponent while ranked in the top five itself.
With a 2-0 record, the Trojans exhibited solid defense against Northwestern, anchored by junior goalie Gussie Johns who notched 17 saves and eight ground balls to tie the program record. Johns’ stout performance earned her MPSF Defensive Player of the Week honors. Johns and the entire Trojan defense were successful when they worked in conjunction with one another in order to shut down the Wildcat offense.
“Our strength is playing as a unit,” head coach Lindsay Munday said. “We are best when all eight players, including the goaltender, are playing together.”
Freshman midfielder Kerrigan Miller was also instrumental in the Trojan victory, scoring the game-winning goal and recording her first career hat trick. With three caused turnovers, two ground balls and a draw control in addition to her strong offensive performance, Miller was named MPSF Rookie of the Week.
“Her confidence — and it’s really kind of a quiet confidence — is what I notice the most. She’s really hard on herself and wants to continue to get better and be the best for this team and that’s what’s been exciting to see,” Munday said of Miller.
In just a short amount of time, Miller along with the other nine freshmen have assimilated into the team culture.
“All the girls are super warm and welcoming and I hope that the freshmen felt that as they came in,” senior midfielder Drew Jackson said.
Jackson attributes the Trojans’ success on the field to the strong bonds between the girls. The team looks to carry this team-oriented and collaborative mindset into competition this weekend.
“We learned how much team chemistry we have,” Jackson said. “Being able to stick together and stick to what we know, we learned a lot.”
While the Trojans emerged victorious on Saturday, Munday acknowledges that the girls have growing room in preparation for a tough upcoming schedule.
“Northwestern is a phenomenal team, and we need to keep getting better from last week and we don’t have a lot of time to do it before another really great test against Florida,” Munday said. “They’re extremely fast, extremely athletic and extremely talented so we need to get better from Saturday.”
Heading into a stacked weekend as they travel to Florida, the Trojans are focusing on taking it one step at a time and continuing to build on their foundation.
“It was our first overtime win, so I think we need to build on that and make sure that no matter what the score is we’re always locked in mentally,” Munday said.
