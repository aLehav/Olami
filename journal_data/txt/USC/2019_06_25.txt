Dear President-Elect Folt,
USC is a prideful school. We’re proud to be part of an academic institution that consistently makes breakthroughs in medicine and technology. We’re proud of an alumni network that boasts the top athletes of this nation and the best creatives in Hollywood. And we’re proud to be part of a fiercely loyal Trojan community that believes in the best for its institution. 
That pride, in the past few years, has been tested time and again. We saw the scandal of former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito, who used illicit drugs while seeing patients. We saw USC mishandle complaints against former gynecologist George Tyndall, who sexually abused his patients for nearly 30 years. And we saw the college admission bribery case unfold, revealing that at least 16 USC students and admits were accepted under the guise of athletic recruitment — not only indicting a weak admission process that allowed these practices to occur but also indicting USC’s students, who were smeared as elitist when, in reality, our population represents a diversity of backgrounds. 
Pride, for Trojans, is built on the knowledge that USC will act in the best interests of its students, first. In these cases, the University failed. Instead, it acted in the interest of money, public image and personal interest. The school had lost its way — and instead of holding itself accountable, our local newspaper always had to step in to disclose the truth.
But pride also instills an unwavering sense of hope. And, Dr. Folt, as you take office at USC next week, we will be putting all of our hope in you. We hope that you right USC’s ship and that you will be committed to putting students and their interests first. And we hope that you can restore our trust in an institution we deeply care for. 
We’re excited to see that new faces are already joining your administration, such as Senior Vice President for Human Resources Felicia Washington and Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Glenn Osaki. With former President C.L. Max Nikias, retiring Provost Michael Quick, and former Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry all gone, USC is clearing out the group of people who oversaw the scandals mentioned above. We hope that the fresh blood you’re bringing revitalizes and reenergizes our school. 
Your history dealing with misconduct is heartening: When you first took on the chancellorship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, you inherited an academic scandal in which students, particularly student-athletes, were able to take “paper classes,” which allowed them to pass while completing little work for the courses. It’s not dissimilar to the college admission bribery case. According to the Daily Tar Heel, you enacted 70 reforms in the wake of these wrongdoings and took disciplinary action against nine employees. 
And in January, you took action to remove the pedestal for Silent Sam, a deeply controversial statue of a Confederate soldier that student activists had spent years protesting, despite the wishes of UNC’s Board of Governors. This also came with your resignation. That resolve — standing up for the interests of the student body in the face of a powerful Board and your own interests in keeping your job — will be crucial for your leadership at USC. 
But at the same time, we also must be wary — students took matters into their own hands to remove Silent Sam months earlier, and you attributed the toppling to “lawlessness” and “mob action.” Like your UNC students, we aren’t afraid to stand up for ourselves. And we hope that you will take our protests and demonstrations as signs of what we know this University can do better.
Where USC has failed, in the past few years, is simple. The University stopped listening to its students and started putting its financial goals ahead of its community. It is vital to the success of your presidency, Dr. Folt, and to the success of this school, that you recognize who your most important stakeholders are: your students. 
This means that student, staff and faculty must be represented in the administration’s decision-making process, namely to give input in search committees as you staff your new administration. The continued strength from groups like the Concerned Faculty of USC, Undergraduate Student Government and Graduate Student Government prove that the community is both capable and committed to bringing this University out of the darkness it has fallen into. 
This means that when the Daily Trojan or any other student groups approach the administration for information concerning the University’s actions is taking, USC should be forthcoming and willing to provide information important for student well-being. 
This means that when you make decisions, Dr. Folt, you should first consider the direct implications they will have on students. Not what they may do to bolster USC’s prestige. Not what they may do for monetary benefit.
In this vein, transparency will be essential to your presidency. When you were first announced to be taking the helm at USC, the Daily Tar Heel wrote in an editorial that the newspaper had major issues with transparency in handling the Silent Sam scandal. They said you only responded to public records requests and released proposals regarding Silent Sam during inconvenient times at UNC. A lack of transparency is what outraged students most about the USC administration’s conduct — when sexual harassment allegations were made against former USC doctor Dennis Kelly in February, USC made only a brief statement and has yet to issue an apology.  
“Honesty, accountability, candor,” you said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “If the community wants that, we are already so far ahead.”
Our wariness won’t go away any time soon. You’ll have to earn our trust and prove to students who have been disappointed over and over again by their administration that you’re going to stay true to your word and provide that promised honesty, accountability and candor. 
Dr. Folt, USC is a prideful school. It’s also an unwaveringly persistent one. We’re believing in you to lead our way to the success we know USC is worthy of — but if you don’t, we’ll be here to hold you accountable.
But for the time being, welcome to USC,  Dr. Folt. We’re so excited to see what you can do for us. 
Daily Trojan Summer 2019 Editorial Board

Freshman guard Kevin Porter Jr. was selected 30th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in Thursday’s star-studded NBA Draft. 
A 6-foot-6 guard out of Seattle, Porter was referred to by many as one of the most underrated players in the draft. Said to be a potential lottery pick, he was finally drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks as the first round came to a close.
Before the draft, the Bucks had agreed to trade forward Tony Snell and their 30th pick to the Detroit Pistons. After Porter was selected, the Pistons traded his rights to the Cavaliers in exchange for four second-round picks and $5 million.
The only Trojan drafted this year, Porter also became the first Trojan selected in the first round since Nikola Vucevic in 2011.
Considered one of the best players from the 2018 recruiting class, Porter signed on at USC hoping to make an immediate impact. 
His season did not go as expected, as off-court misconduct and injuries led him to start just four times all season.
“I feel like I just have to show my character and everything to show that they can trust me, as a player and off the court,” Porter said at last month’s combine.
Despite his brief time as a Trojan, Porter still made the most out of his opportunities. 
In 21 total games with USC, he averaged 9.5 points, 4 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. He finished his freshman season on a high note with 17 points against Washington in the Pac-12 quarterfinals.
“We are proud of Kevin [Porter] and look forward to following his NBA career,” said USC head coach Andy Enfield.
While Porter was the only Trojan to be chosen in this year’s draft, senior forward Bennie Boatwright signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly after the draft.
In his senior season, Boatwright was an anchor for the USC squad. 
After missing the first two games of the season due to injury, he came back and played 31 games. Boatwright finished the season averaging 18.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, earning a spot on the All Pac-12 First Team.
Signing with the Detroit Pistons as an undrafted free agent, he hopes to make an NBA roster after spending all four years at USC, during three of which he was team captain.
Porter and Boatwright also hope to bolster the Trojans’ legacy in the NBA. 
Porter became the third selection for the Men of Troy in the past three years, which ties for the fifth-most selections among all NCAA programs. In addition, both Porter and Boatwright hope to bring USC to eight total active players in the NBA.
“[Porter] has reached his dream of being selected in the NBA Draft and provided a great example of what dedication and love of the game can do for a young player,” Enfield said.

When audiences saw Andy give away Woody and the rest of the gang to Bonnie at the end of “Toy Story 3,” many fans likely  assumed it was the perfect swan song for the beloved characters. That’s why skepticism lingered over the idea of another entry in the “Toy Story” franchise. However, “Toy Story 4” justifies its own existence — though not without hiccups, the film crafts a beautiful sendoff for the franchise’s lead toy, Woody. 
This time around, Woody (Tom Hanks) and the rest of Bonnie’s (Madeleine McGraw) toys are on a road trip vacation to a carnival. The new addition to the group is Forky (Tony Hale), a toy Bonnie made from a spork and craft supplies. 
When Forky, Bonnie’s new favorite toy, gets lost on the road trip, Woody takes it upon himself to make sure he gets back to Bonnie safe. Along the way, there are familiar faces like Bo Peep (Annie Potts), Woody’s long-lost love, and new faces like Key and Peele’s Ducky and Bunny and Keanu Reeves’ hilarious Duke CaBoom. 
For one, “Toy Story 4” looks gorgeous. It seems Pixar’s animation quality has taken a massive leap even since last year’s “Incredibles 2.” The attention to details in “Toy Story 4” like rain, nature and the many different textures of toy surfaces are highly detailed — approximating photorealistic presentation. The movie’s cinematography and production design create beautiful visuals that perfectly accompany the story and characters in each frame. 
“Toy Story 4” is a true technical marvel to experience in a big, dark movie theater, as Randy Newman’s emotional score floods into the aisles and Woody and the gang light up the screen. 
The best thing about “Toy Story 4” is its keen focus on Woody’s journey. Director Josh Cooley displays Woody’s nostalgic desires fantastically as we see him grappling with moving on from Andy and adjusting to Bonnie’s room. More so than any previous film, this fourth installment is almost exclusively about Woody and his journey to figure out what his purpose is beyond taking care of one kid. 
However, this focus also creates some problems. The original gang of toys is grossly underused, especially Buzz (Tim Allen), Woody’s best friend. The main players of the film are Woody, Bo Peep and the aforementioned new characters. While these are all a joy to be around, the film’s multiple storylines didn’t let any supporting character shine too much (the only exceptions here may be Forky and the hilarious pairing of Ducky and Bunny who get several recurring bits throughout the movie). 
By not tightly joining Bo Peep, Forky and Buzz’s stories together, Woody’s swan song feels all over the place. Its biggest problem may be the lack of classic Woody and Buzz chemistry. And while the ending of the film was emotionally ambitious, it failed to pack the parting punch every character deserved, especially those two. 
While the film is largely an enjoyable ride, it is hard not to feel slightly underwhelmed by the slump in the story and emotion department compared to previous installments. “Toy Story” fans should check the movie out in theaters, but should prepare to see more imperfections than they may have initially  hoped for.

USC parent Toby MacFarlane pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy in federal court in Boston Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
Prosecutors recommend MacFarlane, an insurance executive, spend 15 months in prison with one year of supervised release, pay a fine of $95,000 and restitution in the amount determined by the court at sentencing and forfeit any relevant personal assets, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
Among the 33 parents charged in the college admissions bribery scheme, MacFarlane is the last of 14 to plead guilty. MacFarlane had already pleaded guilty to mail fraud conspiracy and honest services mail fraud in April.The remaining 19, including USC parents Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded not guilty.
In 2014, MacFarlane paid William “Rick” Singer, the organizer of the scheme, $200,000 to help admit his daughter to the University as a fake soccer recruit, according to court documents. 
MacFarlane’s daughter was listed a “U.S. Club Soccer All-American” on applications. That title doesn’t exist, according to court documents.
Former USC soccer coaches Ali Khosroshahin and Laura Janke, who pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges and agreed to cooperate with the investigation, were also involved in the scheme, receiving $50,000 from Singer in exchange for admitting MacFarlane’s daughter to the University. 
MacFarlane also paid Singer $250,000 to admit his son to the University as a fake basketball recruit in 2016, even though he had not played the sport at the varsity level until his senior year of high school, the Times reported.
After his son’s acceptance was facilitated by former senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel, who has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy, MacFarlane paid USC Athletics $50,000, according to court documents.
MacFarlane’s son withdrew from the University in 2018 and his daughter graduated that same year.
MacFarlane will be sentenced Nov. 13. 
His lawyer did not respond in time for publication.

Following a losing 7-11 season in Pac-12 conference play, the USC women’s basketball team has brought in two promising graduate transfers — guards Stephanie Watts and Aliyah Jeune — to aid the team in its upcoming season.
The program is looking to rebuild after losing several notable players from this past season. Guards Mariya Moore and Aliyah Mazyck finished their final seasons as Trojans, while guard Minyon Moore and forward Ja’Tavia Tapley decided to transfer.
All four were consistent starters who, despite the team’s poor record, rose to the challenge against some of the NCAA’s fiercest competitors. Minyon Moore’s absence will be especially difficult for the Trojans, as she led the team last season in points, free throws, assists, rebounds and steals.
Although the Trojans’ top talents have left, graduate transfers Watts and Jeune are poised to make an immediate impact this season.
During her three seasons at North Carolina, Watts earned the 2016 ACC Freshman of the Year distinction and scored 1,320 total points. She netted an average of 15.2 points per game while amassing 82 3-pointers, only four shy of USC’s all-time record.
A consistent scoring threat, Watts also put up several record-breaking single game performances. She broke the ACC’s record for 3-pointers in a game in her sophomore season with 10 makes, and came up just short of this mark last season with nine 3-pointers in a game.
“Stephanie is a great scorer and had a very successful career at the University of North Carolina,” USC’s head coach Mark Trakh said. “She will bring a tremendous level of experience and leadership to our program. We can’t wait to see Stephanie on the court in a USC jersey.”
Jeune’s decision to become a Trojan was announced last Tuesday, three weeks after Watt was welcomed to the program. Jeune played two seasons for Rutgers before leaving for Morehead State. As a Beaker, she sat out for a season before earning the OVC Newcomer of the Year honors as a redshirt junior.
At Morehead State, Jeune averaged 16.1 points and 6.1 rebounds per game with three double-doubles. Also a talented defender, she was the linchpin in a Morehead State team that which surged to second place in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament last season.
“Aliyah is an athletic wing who can defend, shoot the three and get to the basket,” Trakh said. “We are very excited about our prospects for the upcoming season.”
Along with the two transfers, the Trojans are bringing in six impressive freshmen.
“[The 2019 class] is a very talented group with a great mixture of positions,” Trakh said. “We have height, strength and shooting. All these young women come from successful programs and are winners.”
Center Angel Jackson — Minyon Moore’s former teammate — ranks No. 24 overall and No. 4 at her position nationwide, according to Prospectsnation. Jackson’s versatility is demonstrated by her 21 double-doubles and a triple-double in her senior season for which she garnered First Team All-State Honors.
“Angel possesses an interior presence with a very unique ability to score, rebound, defend and alter the game with her size,” Trakh said. “She is a very elite prospect who matches skill with her athleticism. She will have the ability to have an equivalent impact to our program as some of the greats before her at USC.”
The Trojans’ new talent joins returning players redshirt sophomore guard Shalexxus Aaron, sophomore guard Desiree Caldwell, and senior forward Kayla Overbeck as the Trojans seek Pac-12 contention this coming season.

The Service Employees International Union Local 721 has withdrawn its petition to represent Roski School of Art and Design faculty, Provost Michael Quick announced June 19. The SEIU will also drop pending charges against USC regarding unfair labor practices.
“What this means for Roski and all other schools, is that Academic Senate, faculty committees and faculty councils remain free to work with administration on compensation, benefits and terms of employment,” Quick wrote in a letter to USC faculty. “Faculty can continue to speak for themselves on these topics, without having to get union permission.”
Roski’s decision to withdraw representation follows a March D.C. appeals court ruling that decided non-tenured faculty at USC cannot form unions. Under the March ruling in the National Labor Relations Board v. USC case, non-tenured faculty positions are considered managerial positions. Previously,  a decision by the NLRB in 2015 said full- and part-time non-tenure track Roski employees had the right to form a union with SEIU, despite University protest.
In 2016, eligible Roski faculty voted to join SEIU Local 721 along with faculty from the International Academy following complaints of low wages and few benefits. Faculty from Dornsife College of Arts and Sciences also voted but failed to unionize.
The University has made significant progress since 2016, Quick wrote.
“Working with the Academic Senate, we have made important progress on salaries and employment conditions for both full-time and part-time faculty,” Quick wrote. “All USC faculty, tenured and [Research, Teaching, Practice and Clinical Faculty,] have representatives who play a vital role in making important decisions about our University. This will continue under President Carol Folt.”
According to Quick, USC has yet to reach an agreement with SEIU over the International Academy.
“After the January 2016 vote to have the SEIU be the exclusive bargaining representative of the English language teachers there, the union and USC have bargained in good faith but have not reached agreement on a contract,” Quick wrote. “We remain at impasse.”

USC and UCLA’s graduate and undergraduate student governments released a joint statement June 17 denouncing both schools’ treatment of campus sexual assault issues. The statement comes on the heels of the arrest of a UCLA gynecologist and after a judge approved a settlement with USC for victims of George Tyndall.  
“[We,] who collectively represent over 93,000 students in Los Angeles County, stand in solidarity with the hundreds of individuals who allege sexual harassment and battery against these three former student health doctors [Tyndall, Dennis Kelly, James Heaps,] among other incidents on campus,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the $215 million class-action settlement between USC and survivors of Tyndall. USC stated it is aware of sexual harassment allegations against Kelly, a former medical provider at the Engemann Student Health Center who was accused of targeting students based on their sexualities.
The student leaders at USC and UCLA connected through the Shared Governance Symposium, a meeting for student government representatives from several Los Angeles colleges, said Robert Watson, UCLA’s Undergraduate Students Association Council President. Held at USC for the first time in February this year, it allowed USC and UCLA representatives to set agendas for school governance and eventually draft the statement. 
“I think that there was definitely a shared desire to release some sort of statement that indicated both of our student governments’ interests in continuing to push administration to be more transparent about these matters because not [doing so] ultimately becomes a threat to the safety and well-being of students,” Watson said.
According to USG President Trenton Stone, the statement is the first step toward demanding cultural change on campus and increased accountability from both institutions. 
“This [statement] is for our communities, for our student body — to show that we’re aware and we stand in solidarity and, of course, that as an organization and as individuals,  we want to condemn the behavior that’s happened at both of the health centers,” Stone said.
While USG cannot make resolutions in the summer, Stone said the organization is currently building the framework for a sexual assault task force. USG also plans on making issues of harassment and student safety primary concerns moving forward, according to Stone.
USC said in a statement to the Daily Trojan that it has implemented changes at the Engemann Student Health Center following the lawsuits against Kelly and Tyndall such as hiring female, board-certified physicians, instating a more effective complaint-resolution system and introducing patient education materials on sensitive health examinations.
“The health and safety of our students is our top priority,” USC said. “Over the past two years, the University has significantly strengthened operations and oversight at the [Engemann] Student Health Center. We welcome input from student government leaders and all students on additional enhancements.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, allegations against Heaps first became known to UCLA officials in 2017, and the former campus doctor retired June 2018 following an internal investigation. School officials did not make students aware of the reason for Heaps’ departure until Chancellor Gene Block announced his arrest to the community in early June, the Daily Bruin reported.
“We do have corruption at this school,” said Zak Fisher, president of UCLA’s Graduate Student Association. “We do have the impulse — when negative news coverage comes out — to cover it up.”
Fisher said he feels outraged over the lack of transparency at UCLA and believes the university needs to reevaluate its priorities, such as by launching an investigation into the matter.
“The administration protected themselves, and I think that, unfortunately, the reality is [that] people feel less protected,” Fisher said. “That includes my constituents.”
According to the Daily Bruin, Heaps worked part-time at the UCLA Arthur Ashe Center for Student Health & Wellness for 28 years, treating UCLA students. At least 22 women have stepped forward and alleged sexual misconduct against the doctor during his tenure at the university, the Times reported.
The joint statement calls for both institutions to make student safety regarding sexual harassment a top priority.
“While we recognize past efforts to improve our student health systems, as well as litigation to indemnify victims, we request that — outside of any court proceedings — relevant administrative units continue to review health system policies and make changes that will better ensure patient safety,” the statement read.
Fisher and Watson aim to continue meeting with UCLA administration to call for transparency, accountability and a possible investigation into Heaps’ alleged misconduct.

Run by the same family enterprise that feeds stacks of pancakes to hungry students at Jacks N Joe next door, Tirebiter Brewery celebrated its grand opening this past weekend. 
“We pretty much just made the place we would want to go to,” said Dagmar Gudmundsson, a USC alumnus and Tirebiter’s assistant manager. Isabelle Bednorz, the co-owner of the brewery, concurred. 
“We can’t have everyone over at our house, but we can create this place and invite all our friends [and] family,” Bednorz said.
The brewery is set in an enclave just to the right of Jacks N Joe, which can make it hard to find, but Mark Bednorz, Isabelle’s father and a co-owner of Tirebiter along with his wife Vianney, sees that as a positive.
“It’s like an oasis away from the city. You don’t hear traffic. There’s no cars going by,” Mark Bednorz said.
Enclosed by buildings on all sides, Tirebiter houses a full brewery that sits out in the open behind the bar as a projector constantly runs, screening everything from old black-and-white films to the NBA Finals.
But Tirebiter isn’t just a place to hang out and talk. Unlike a lot of the other bars and restaurants around campus, it presents live music on a small stage inside the brewery.
The grand opening  featured a performance by Charlie Lubeck, a contender on the second season of Oxygen’s “The Glee Project,” playing upbeat music with his guitar. On Saturday night, Thornton School of Music student Thaddeus Scherer  continued the festivities with an acoustic set. Afterward, David Ayscue & Friends — also a USC Thornton alumnus-led band -— closed out the night with a funky setlist delivered to a packed house.
Rather than spend on advertising, Tirebiter spends money on paying musicians for performing in their space. To bring in customers, they hope to foster the same organic word-of-mouth publicity that made Jacks N Joe a local hot spot.
“My best advertisement is you going and being like ‘oh my god’ and telling somebody ‘I had the most amazing whatever,’” Vianney Bednorz said. “And then you bring them in, or they come in because you told them.” 
Attesting to this strategy is the fact that Tirebiter already has some regular customers who have come by at least three or four times, even though the brewery held its soft opening only two weeks ago. The family explained that the brewery itself is “handcrafted,” with the family and team pitching in long hours to put the place together. 
 “It’s just family. Maybe that’s the word for it.” Isabelle Bednorz said. “It is made with love.”
“[Both] the beer and the place,” Vianney Bednorz added.

The college admissions process is a stressful one, but it becomes more complicated for children of military families. 
For the past five years, USC’s Pre-College Summer Scholarship for Military High School Students has helped these students get a headstart in their academic careers.
Angie Riveria, a rising high school senior from Winchester, Calif. and current student in the program, said her Marine father convinced her to sign up. 
“I wanted to have the college experience — to be able to visit USC and solidify what I want for my life,” Riveria said. 
The program allows 30 high school students with parents in the military to receive a full scholarship to attend a four week summer program in areas such as architecture, business and entrepreneurship, engineering, global studies, journalism, pre-health and science, pre-law, performing arts and writing and critical thinking. 
Riveria hopes to pursue a career in international relations — in the summer program, students examine war complexities and beginnings. Her program uses reenactments of international issues and case studies to teach negotiation exercises and find ways to peacefully solve problems.
Riveria said one of the most memorable aspects of the program was her trip to the Museum of Tolerance, which focuses on prejudice, racism and genocides. 
“I want to learn more about politics and the world,” Riveria said. “It’s been really good so far.”
Audrey Daly, a recent USC graduate, returned to the program as a residential assistant. Before being admitted to USC, she participated in the summer program’s musical theater track and took classes at the School of Dramatic Arts.
“I can attribute my acceptance into the theater program [at USC] to the military program,” Daly said. “I already knew the professors auditioning me, and they knew my body of work.”
Daly said the program allowed her to develop her passions and become a stronger version of herself. Upon entering the University, she delved deeper into music, joining the a cappella group USC Sirens in large part due to her involvement in the program, she said. 
“I’ve matured in so many ways,” Daly said. “I’ve become much more independent with much more drive … [USC] made me become a better leader and responsible adult.” 
Daly said she was grateful to the program for introducing her to her peers, with whom she has since formed long-lasting relationships. 
“The other unintended joy was how much I loved my colleagues … because I have found a ragtag team of wonderful people who are so supportive,” Daly said. “[There’s] this whole community of people that I would never have met if not for this program.”
Christine Lord, an RA who was also a participant in the program, said she hopes current students in the program are able to discover and cultivate their passions just as she did. 
“Being an RA who was a part of the program help[s] me connect with the students better,” said Lord, a senior majoring in sociology. “I was able to help them with the USC admissions process, homework [and other concerns.]”
Vice Provost for Academic Operations Mark Todd said he hopes to ensure college accessibility for children of the military through the program. 
“USC has a long-standing history of supporting U.S. service members, veterans and their families,” Todd said. “The Provost’s Pre-College Scholarship provides an opportunity for high school-aged children of veterans and active duty-service women and men to see that first-rate higher-education institutions like USC are a real possibility.”
