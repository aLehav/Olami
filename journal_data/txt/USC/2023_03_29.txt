Student Health will host event programming for Transgender Day of Visibility March 30 and 31 and sexual assault awareness events throughout the month of April, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
Events centered around transgender awareness include documentary screenings and a panel Q&A hosted in conjunction with the TransLatin@ Coalition March 30. The event is co-sponsored by Keck Pride and the GEMS Center for Gender Equity in Medicine & Science. On March 31, Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention, a Student Health organization, will host Trans-ffirmation: Supporting Gender-Expansive Survivors, a wellness art program that aims to encourage participants to explore mindfulness and their emotions through art. Participants will create art that goes towards care packages for Casa de Zulma, Los Angeles’ first ever trans-femme specific shelter and resource center.
“This is a great opportunity for people to … get support,” Van Orman said. “I really encourage …  allies to take a moment to use this as an opportunity to reflect, learn, grow and participate in awareness building activities … so that they can be better allies.”
Van Orman also noted that experiencing discrimination or lack of inclusivity based on gender has a profound impact on the health of individuals.
“When we want to raise the health of our entire community, days like this are really important so that members of our [transgender] community can feel heard,” Van Orman said.
April will also mark the kickoff of Student Health’s sexual assault awareness month programming. Beginning with a launch event at the Trojan Farmers Market April 5, events such as resource fairs and a trauma informed care workshop hosted at Health Sciences Campus will strive to build awareness among the USC community.
“Unfortunately, we know that many students are not aware of our services [or] the availability of 24/7 advocates,” Van Orman said. “We also really want to use this opportunity to highlight resources that are available on campus.”
These resources include advocates available through the RSVP program that are available 24/7 by calling Student Health’s direct number.
Advocates can provide a range of support, Van Orman said, from simply providing a safe space for survivors to accompanying them to report sexual assault to law enforcement or seek forensic examinations at a sexual assault response center. Advocates are also available if students need to bring a sexual assault case to court or report an incident to USC’s Office for Equity, Equal Opportunity, and Title IX.
“The services of the advocates, really importantly, are completely confidential,” Van Orman said, stressing this as a distinction from campus faculty who are obligated to report instances of sexual assault.
Coronavirus cases totaled 76 last week, a slight uptick post-spring break, but nothing dramatic, Van Orman said. Student Health has seen cases of normal colds, but cases have not been dominated by either the coronavirus or influenza.
“We are working as a University in terms of transitioning [now that] the state of emergency is ending in L.A. County on March 31st,” Van Orman said. Student Health will continue to work with the University to scale back coronavirus-related policies as campus looks to return to a pre-pandemic normal.

“Everything, everywhere, all at once.” Those were the words with which President Carol Folt opened her State of the University address, held early Tuesday morning at Bovard Auditorium. It was also the title of the film that swept the 95th Academy Awards, including a Best Supporting Actor win for School of Cinematic Arts alum Ke Huy Quan. Not only was “Everything Everywhere All At Once” a “mind-bending film,” Folt said, it also captured “the tenor of our times.”
“We’re really living in the proverbial winds of change, every day: shifting demographics, the need for new foundational skills, the changing nature of work, the STEM revolution,” Folt said. “These issues, and war, are really sweeping us into a swirl of confusing signals. … That swirl is also magnified in universities, because the nation’s campuses, as you all know, are on the frontline for Big Tech, societal and political issues.”
Amid continued attacks on education across the United States, such as book bans and restrictions against subjects taught in universities, Folt acknowledged USC’s privilege of not being “forced or [choosing] to go backwards in any of those areas.”
“We’ll continue to honor and support and learn from the experiences of our diverse and global communities, and we’ll support the multitude of voices and perspectives that make universities such compelling forces for change,” Folt said. “So let’s just return to thinking about everything everywhere. All at once.”
For Folt, this manifested as a 45-minute-long speech, painting USC as a distinguished research university, adept at adjusting to the rapid societal and technological changes at the turn of a new decade. Running parallel with these larger changes were changes to the University itself: USC onboarded several new leaders in the past year, including a Kaufman School of Dance dean, a Thornton School of Music dean, an inaugural vice provost for the arts, a new CEO of USC Arcadia Hospital, two new senior vice president positions and a new Department of Public Safety chief. The Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards system also received a revamp, Folt said, to “very positive feedback” from students and faculty members.
USC faculty “continue to garner incredible national and international awards,” Folt said: 11 professors were inducted into prestigious national academies, and funding grants rose 8% in 2022 from the previous year. Of the 3,500 research proposals submitted this academic year — altogether valued at $3.5 billion — 40% were funded, significantly over the usual 10%.
“That exceptional figure places our research among the very top in the nation,” Folt said.
USC is also in a strong financial position, as it raised $770 million in pledges and gifts — “one of the top years in our history,” Folt said — and paid off nearly $2.5 billion in legacy coronavirus and legal expenses.
Folt gave a list of “moonshots,” or long-term goals, for the year. The first is continuing the USC Competes initiative, which focuses on increasing financial aid opportunities for students and competitive wages for faculty and staff. Another goal was continuing to evaluate remote work flexibility. Folt said that the University has, “for several years, added an additional week of holiday vacation at year’s end” — to great applause from the audience, a majority of which was faculty and staff.
Another moonshot was a so-called “USC 3.0” — a restructuring of the University’s health sciences programs including a new Board of Trustees, faculty growth, additional research support and the realignment of all health-related schools under Senior Vice President for Health Affairs Dr. Steve Shapiro.
Other goals Folt listed were a commitment to the athletic and academic success of student athletes, and the continuation of initiatives reducing carbon emissions.
USC’s admissions also saw significant changes this year. Almost 81,000 people applied for first-year admission, a 17% increase from last year’s pool. More than 1 in 5 students admitted to the Class of 2027 were first-generation college students; more than 1 in 3 identified as being from historically underrepresented racial or ethnic backgrounds in U.S. higher education.
“We’ve been about that diverse for about 10 years,” Folt said in response to the statistics, during a joint interview Tuesday with Annenberg Media, ATVN and the Daily Trojan. Folt referred to the First Generation Plus Success Center — established in 2020 for students who are first-generation, undocumented, transfer and former foster youth — as an example of the University’s successes in accommodating a diverse student body.
This spring was also a big semester for unionization movements. On Friday, USC shuttle drivers and dispatchers won a union election by one vote; graduate student workers also successfully unionized in February. Folt said in the joint interview that while she believed “people get to make a choice,” she herself had to “do everything possible to not put people between us.”
“I have preferred the idea that any grad student can come talk to us, that anybody can come negotiate with us; that doesn’t happen anymore,” Folt said. “We will work very carefully with [the unions] to come up with the proper agreements, but in the end, we want to continue to make sure that we have as few middle people between us — our students and our faculty and our staff — as possible.”
July marks Folt’s fourth full year as president. Folt said in her address that she was “going to feel like a senior … in the Class of 2023,” and that she hopes to leave those “four transformative wonderful years … with a sense of hope and purpose.”
“I choose to see USC’s future as limitless,” Folt said. “I hope when people think of USC, they’ll think of a place where there is excellence in everything, everywhere all at once.”

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously voted in support of two resolutions — one in support of adding caste as a protected category in USC’s Title IX code notice of non-discrimination, and another regarding the unlawful detainment of Sikh activist Amritpal Singh and human rights violations in Punjab — at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting.
Caste is a structure of oppression in which social status is determined by birth, affecting over a billion people across different religions and countries. Hindu societies assert one’s “spiritual purity” based on four main caste groups: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, as well as those outside the caste system, known as Dalits.
“I’m coming here today with a personal sense of accountability, as a person who belongs to a caste privileged community and family from India,” said Kritika Pathak, a graduate student studying applied data science. “I’m very ashamed, but not at all surprised, that the diaspora of the South Asian community here in the U.S. is perpetuating the same structures of violence and social exclusion against these communities.”
USC currently prohibits discrimination that includes many of the identities intertwined with caste but does not explicitly condemn caste-based discrimination. Almost all institutions in the United States have long failed to protect caste-oppressed people, the resolution read.
Other leading higher education institutions such as Harvard University, Georgetown University, Brown University, Brandeis University, UC Davis, all California State universities and Scripps College have already added caste to their non-discrimination policies.
“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” said Olu Orange, adjunct assistant professor of political science. “The injustice that happens in the countries that they’re from, then finds its way to the diaspora. And as someone who’s been working at this institution for probably a few more years than some of you guys are old, it really hurts me to hear that people are suffering.”
Since March 18, more than 100 Sikh activists have been arrested or raided without a warrant. India cut off internet access to 27 million people in Punjab as it continued its widespread manhunt for Singh.
“We haven’t seen it talked about anywhere on campus,” said Saihaj Gulati, president of the Sikh Students Association. “Sikhs on campus are scared. I know students who have lost contact with their family and have no idea what’s going on. And all they can do is hope that their family is okay.”
The resolution states that USG denounces any suppression of civil liberties, including unlawful arrests, internet shutdowns and censorship of free speech. It also urges the administration to recognize the current events that affect the Punjab community and to encourage community members to utilize resources provided by the Religious and Spiritual Life Committee and the Sikh Student Association.
“We are very privileged to grow up in America, and even then there are many issues regarding minority rights,” Gulati said. “Today that might be pertaining to my community, but around the world human rights across many communities are being [violated], and I urge you guys to please support us in any way you guys can.”

Content warning: This article contains references to gun violence.
I’ve attempted to stay away from the news this past year for my mental health, but no matter how hard I try, news of mass shootings and gun violence plague my life. In reading ABC7 Eyewitness News reporter Kiara Alfonseca’s latest article, my heart sank deep into the ground. The headline states, “There have been more mass shootings than days in 2023.” 
According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been at least 130 mass shootings in 2023 alone. Broadening the issue just a bit beyond mass shootings, the GVA reports that 410 kids under the age of 18 were killed because of gun violence — fewer kids graduated from my class in high school. 
I feel helpless. 
My 9-year-old niece who has a soccer match in a week and has been practicing since the fall. My 16-year-old annoying little brother who is frantically preparing to apply to colleges. My mom who looks all too similar to those killed in the Monterey Park shooting Jan. 21. It was Lunar New Year and she was out celebrating just as they were. 
Monday morning in Nashville, Tennessee, six more lives were taken because gun control continues to be discussed politically rather than as a safety topic — both in legislative bodies and in society. Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, all 9 years old, and adults Cynthia Peak, 61; Katherine Koonce, 60; and Mike Hill, 61. It was just another school day. It should have been just another school day. 
I am immensely grateful that my loved ones are alive and well, but I can’t help thinking, “What if it was them?” All those who were killed in mass shootings were just living their lives as we all do until a bullet ran through them, leaving their bodies cold and forever still — their families left forever grieving.
The law has rarely provided me with any form of solace, but knowing that state governments have the power to adopt gun safety laws and possess police powers of health, education and welfare eases my sorrows a bit. If I couldn’t trust federal courts to make a change, at least I could have some hope that state governments would. Thank you, Tenth Amendment.
However, as laws regarding female reproductive care and child labor regress back to 1791, before the ratification of the Bill of Rights, I was unsurprised when I found out that the Supreme Court ruled New York’s law that those wanting an unrestricted concealed-carry gun license must show a “special need for self-defense” as unconstitutional.
This decision has set unimaginable consequences in motion. 
United States District Judge Roger Benitez now has three pieces of major gun control legislation in front of him: the assault weapons ban that has been active since 1989, the 2016 large capacity magazine ban and an ammunition background check requirement that went into effect in 2019.
According to Los Angeles Times writer Kevin Rector, “Benitez ordered the state to identify historical laws analogous and ‘relevantly similar to’ each of the laws being challenged.” 
Benitez has a clear history of overturning gun control legislation, but, to make matters worse, Benitez has once compared AR-15 rifles to Swiss Army Knives, stating in his 2021 ruling, “Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. Good for both home and battle.”
Unless there is an imminent battle I am unaware of, the only battle the U.S. should be concerned about is the battle against gun violence. While there is a chance that California can appeal to the 9th Circuit and possibly bring the case back to the Supreme Court, what’s the point? People like Benitez will continue to get in the way of change if every new legislation is constantly seen by gun rights activists as a personal attack on their Second Amendment right.
A 2015 national Public Policy Polling survey found that 83% of gun owners support expanded background checks on all firearm sales — 72% of this group belonged to the National Rifle Association. Yet, on the very first page of the NRA website, they claim that “our rights are under attack like never before.” 
There are those who believe that gun control is not the solution to gun violence in the U.S., but I find it hard to believe that these same people want kids to die. I still have that much faith in humanity.
Either side of the gun control argument is met with opposition from the other side. But it’s time we all understand that it doesn’t matter if you love or hate guns, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon, and children dying at the hands of gun violence isn’t either. Until we stop, innocent lives will be disregarded in favor of arguments.

This Women’s History Month, I want to honor my elementary school teacher, mentor and friend, Nancy Stoudt. In the 14 years I had the privilege of knowing her, she never stopped encouraging me to be a writer. From teaching me how to write a paragraph in under five minutes when I was only in fifth grade to showing me the true picture of courage as she battled cancer for years, Mrs. Stoudt was, and continues to be, an inspiration to me.
When I told her I was majoring in astronautical engineering at USC, she looked at me with a twinkle in her eye that said she knew I was meant to be doing something else. And in my sophomore year of college when she passed away, I knew she was right.
My entire family consists of pharmacists and engineers, so STEM seemed like the only career option to me. Despite fostering a love for reading and writing my whole life, I decided that I had to be an engineer because I felt that any alternative would disappoint everyone.
But when Mrs. Stoudt died, things changed. I was unhappy with my choice of major for a while, but I doubted my ability to be successful outside of STEM. Suddenly, it was like I could hear her telling me that she believed in me, that life is short and I should do what makes me happy. So I gathered my courage and made a huge decision — switching my major to English.
While my parents and sister were supportive of my choice, even telling me that they always knew it was what I would end up doing, not everyone was as kind as my immediate family.
I felt judged by my extended family, friends who remained in engineering and even neighbors and family friends from home. I felt like these people no longer saw me as intelligent or good enough — and that feeling has not gone away despite my accomplishments in my chosen field.
I am fed up with people’s dramatic expressions of disappointment and the bombardments of “What are you going to do with an English degree?” when I tell them about the change.
In talking with Grace Miedziak, a junior majoring in composition, she said she has had a similar experience switching from pursuing STEM to the arts.
“The adults around me were always pushing like, ‘If you’re smart, you should go into something really challenging,’ you know, not like ‘If you’re smart, you can do whatever you want,” Miedziak said.
Miedziak also said that while she appreciates encouragement for women in STEM, there is a difference between encouragement and pressure. Encouragement is showing women that they can do whatever they want; pressure is telling them that they need to pursue STEM to prove their intelligence or be successful.
“Just because maybe it’s a more unconventional path doesn’t mean that it’s not an amazing path,” Miedziak said. “We should celebrate women doing what makes them happy and not just save that celebration for when they choose to go into STEM.”
Shelby Wu, a junior majoring in industrial and systems engineering, spoke of the importance of doing what makes you happy, no matter what field of study that may be.
“At the end of the day, if you really don’t enjoy STEM, don’t try and force yourself to pursue it,” Wu said. “However, if you really do like STEM, I think it’s a great place that is starting to have more social change … [and it makes you] understand your value as [a] woman in STEM because of the different perspective you can give.”
To everyone struggling to fit into the “women in STEM” mold, don’t feel like you need to in order to be successful. You are worthy of admiration and respect for doing whatever you choose.
And to Mrs. Stoudt, thank you for giving me the courage to do what I love.

I love pound cake. Rich and buttery but not overly sweet, pound cake is very dense with light flavors. It was created in England during the 1700s and was named after its original recipe, which called for a pound of each of its four ingredients: sugar, eggs, flour and butter. Baking (and cooking) has always had a special place in my heart because my mother and I would always bond in the kitchen. She started me off with small things — washing and chopping veggies and mixing things mostly. 
Now, baking has become an outlet for me to destress. In fact, during Fall 2022, I was particularly overwhelmed and proceeded to make 70 melted snowman cookies in one night for my students and coworkers. 
My pound cake recipe was devised when my mother-in-law texted me late one night that she was craving “algo sencillo” — “something simple.” I immediately jumped at the opportunity to make it and began looking up recipes for “simple” desserts, but none fit the description. Going back to the drawing board, I remember looking into the pantry and seeing pancake mix. Initially, I thought it was crazy, but it seemed versatile enough and the batter needed to be thick, so I decided to try my luck with it.
It was at this point that I realized I needed something to keep the cake moist — because who wants to choke on a piece of dry cake? I initially wanted to use butter, but figured I would have to cream the butter and sugar, which, on a lazy day, seems like entirely too much work — so I opted for oil.
I watched the cake cook in the oven and remember thinking it was entirely too easy, so I kept telling myself it was not going to come out right. After checking at the 30-minute mark, it took a grueling 15 more minutes to finish, something I learned after opening the oven and poking it every 3 to 5 minutes. Once it was done, I took it out and left it to cool. It looked and smelled good — and that was enough for me — so I packed it up and drove to my mother-in-law’s house.
I gathered everyone in the house up, cut into the cake and made them swear to be as brutally honest as possible. The 10 seconds of silence as they tried the cake was the most nerve-wracking moment; I felt like I was on “Chopped” and the judges were trying my dish. The pound cake was finished within an hour. That was over a year ago, and since then, my husband’s entire family constantly asks me to make it.
If my extended family’s captivation over the cake hasn’t convinced you, hear me out. I love this recipe because it is truly foolproof. For the most part, you can eyeball the recipe and it will still come out amazing. The milk could also be substituted with nut or oat milk.
Ingredients: 
– 1 cup all purpose flour
– 1 cup pancake mix
– 1 cup Granulated sugar
– 1 cup milk
– 1 cup vegetable oil
– 3 eggs 
– 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
– 2 teaspoons of baking soda
Directions: 
Start by preheating your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and grease your baking pan. I prefer to use a loaf pan, but you can use pretty much anything you have. The darker the pan you use, the darker the crust your cake will have. If you use a dark non-stick pan, the loaf is a dark golden brown, whereas if you use a glass dish, it has a light caramel tint to it, influencing the firmness of the loaf. 
Combine all your ingredients in one bowl and beat until well-combined, pausing to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl — this is important because there may be dried stuck flour at the bottom of the bowl. You should have a completely smooth and uniform batter. 
Pour your batter into the prepared pan and cook for around 45 minutes or until it is firm. A way to test for doneness is to get a toothpick or skewer and poke it in the center of the cake; you want the stick to be completely free of batter and crumbs. 
Cool completely on a wire rack, then run a knife around the sides of the pan before carefully inverting onto a cooling rack. Allow the cake to cool completely before serving. 
I hope you decide to try a recipe that has become a staple in my home and  brought many people together. As someone who loves to cook for others, the reactions from people when they first bite into this cake makes my heart skip a beat each time. The symphonies of “mms,” “ahhs,” and “ohmiigawds” is totally worth the hour it takes to prep, make the cake and clean up after yourself (because yes, we clean as we cook in this house).  
Warning: If you make this delectable pound cake and other people try it, they will harass you to make it again and again.

What might have been a quiet Sunday sounded a little louder on March 26. Lincoln Heights is where music connoisseurs celebrated the ninth edition of Sunday Sounds. The music festival was put on by Anabelle Kline-Zilles and her independent music curation company, That Good Sh*t, in collaboration with Green Tea Studios, an independent recording studio in West Los Angeles. It’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before Sunday Sounds becomes a right of passage for any and all talented musicians on their way to fame. 
“That Good Sh*t is just all about good music regardless of genre,” said Kline-Zilles in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
The playlist-curating company takes on many roles, from hosting live performances and events to album reviews. Sunday Sounds is best described as “in real-life experience” of a classic That Good Sh*t playlist, Kline-Zilles said. With the festival’s main focus on promoting creators and their art, evidently it was a success. Anabelle explained that Sunday Sounds is “about building a community around good music,” and on Sunday it seemed that her goal was perfectly executed.
The music festival shared the same vibe as every artist on the lineup: lowkey. A long narrow passage to the center point of the venue encouraged people to introduce themselves. Then, having made acquaintances, they reached the center stage where DJs Selfish IRV and Anastazja were putting on the performances of a lifetime. 
The crowd’s head bobs turned into a choreographed groove. Selfish IRV and Anastazja needed no other help to get the crowd right. Playing anything from pop to Los Angeles underground rap, the consistently good sets from Selfish IRV and Anastazja led to a successful event. 
Hosting a total of nine performers, Sunday Sounds definitely ran on a tight schedule. While a few technical issues delayed the first performance, That Good Sh*t quickly took no time to troubleshoot and carried  on with the show.
The festival began with a performance by L.A.-based rapper Trip Rexx. Carrying on the momentum provided by Selfish IRV and Anastazja, Trip Rexx was able to get the crowd jumping in no time. His rap/rock fusion caused a mosh pit to form among those already jumping to his autotune melodies. Trip Rexx’s performance of his hit song “Me & My Bimmer,” which has more than 1 million streams on Spotify, set the tone for the rest of the performance. 
After Trip Rexx, Sunday Sounds presented DAMAG3 and Sughn. Both performers carried on the energy presented by Trip Rexx and yet another set by Selfish IRV and Anastazja that didn’t disappoint. Despite all artists having unique styles and forms of music, all benefited from the warm, welcoming and supportive crowd. 
Another aspect worth highlighting was the vendor list. As Sunday Sounds’ mission is to shed light on all creatives and their art, the vendors were undoubtedly just as talented as the performers. Overall, the festival hosted many vendors, ranging from jewelry to fashion. 
One vendor specifically stood out and established dominance among the crowd. The company “Humo” is a Salinas-based cannabis supplier that is Mexico-based and Mexican-ran. The company aims to “eliminate the stigma surrounding cannabis in the Latino community by celebrating our rich cultural history with the plant and normalizing its daily use.” Everything from its “Fresas Con Crema” hybrid pre-roll to its “Arroz Con Leche” sativa-dominant strain screams Latine culture. 
Johnny Santiago, a field marketing manager at Humo, explained that the company “loves to inspire and support other people.” 
For that reason, it was essential that Humo take part in a festival that aligns with the cannabis company’s vision. 
“They are doing it for people who are up and coming,” Santiago said.
Humo, only being around for one year, has seen much success, ranking in the “top 50 in California,” Santiago said.  Much like the artists performing, companies like Humo benefit from the exposure the Sunday Sounds festival generates. The cannabis company currently sells in several dispensaries over L.A. including LaLaLand, which is within a mile of campus. 
From the vendors to the performers, Sunday Sounds is for the people. It’s truly refreshing to see the welcoming world of underground music, especially hip-hop/rap-based music, in the L.A. It’s safe to say that Sunday Sounds and the creative mind of Anabelle Kline-Zilles will have much success in creating a welcoming, warm and popular space in the music industry.

For all its ambitions and previous attempts (some successful, some not) in appealing to audiences, Disney might be onto something truly great with “Prom Pact” (2023). Maybe ambition is the key to a great movie; that’s certainly the case with “Prom Pact,” directed by Anya Adams, which is the story of Mandy Yang (Peyton Elizabeth Lee), an ambitious high school senior whose only goal in life is to get into Harvard. When she gets waitlisted, Mandy becomes determined to do anything she can to get that acceptance letter. 
Mandy’s plan involves forming a relationship with Graham Lansing (Blake Draper), the most popular guy in school, to get a letter of recommendation from Graham’s father (Christopher Shyer), a Harvard alum and senator. Mandy begins to tutor Graham as part of her scheme. She and her best friend, Ben Plunkett (Milo Manheim), whom she’s made a “pact” to go to prom with, soon fall in with the popular crowd of their high school as a result of Mandy’s attempts with Graham. With barely any time left before prom and the end of senior year, they realize they’ve missed out on essential parts of the high school experience.
Although predictably cheesy at many points, “Prom Pact” is exceedingly enjoyable. It’s not often that an ambitious, college-driven Asian American girl is depicted as the lead character in a rom-com, particularly when she’s in a position to have a romance with the school’s most popular guy. It’s doubly satisfying to see that drive for college smoothly incorporated into the narrative flow and Mandy’s character development. Lee does an incredible job with her role, and deserves all the acceptances she can get for her comedic abilities and expressions of vulnerability.
The fact that Mandy is so focused on getting into her dream college means that she doesn’t experience all the typical activities associated with what “high school” is. It’s important that the filmmakers acknowledge that, and it’s clear that they do — displaying Mandy’s disgust toward high school romances or partying. That awareness adds to the film’s understanding of its central character. 
As part of her story arc, Mandy must realize what she’s missed out on in her single-minded devotion to Harvard. Those who relate to Mandy’s situation witness that need through her tutoring sessions with Graham. Over the course of the story, audiences may find Mandy’s conflict — choosing between sticking to her old dream or chasing a new one — a relevant theme strengthened by Lee’s understanding of the character. 
When it comes to the full cast of characters, there’s not much to nitpick. With skills that parallel those of Lee’s, Draper portrays Graham with both innate sensitivity and the charming swagger that reflect why he’s the main love interest. 
As Ben, Manheim is adorably and realistically awkward in his interactions with others. When it comes to being Ben’s love interest, popular girl LaToya Reynolds (Monique Green), is positively radiant in her sweetness and her confidence. Despite the script being a bit shaky at certain points, the performances carry the story forward. 
What sets “Prom Pact” above all else is how it embraces breaking barriers. It’s more than what character occupies the lead role. “Prom Pact” is relevant because it shows a girl who doesn’t conform to the ruling cultural expectations of a high schooler. Mandy isn’t into anything unrelated to college prep; after all, what use is going to a football game if it doesn’t contribute to her goal of getting into Harvard?
In fact, it’s only through the course of pursuing her own goal, Harvard, that Mandy gets to experience those activities that are key to her growth throughout the film. Through well-placed character quips and banter, the filmmakers take note of Mandy’s differences from the characters of other overdone high school protagonists. 
While retaining the charm of older Disney films such as “High School Musical” (2006) and “Camp Rock” (2008), “Prom Pact” elevates itself by depicting a high school experience that is often sidelined. This is the story of an Asian American girl who wants college more than she wants love, but also desires to find a new way of experiencing everything high school has to offer. 
If “Prom Pact” is meant to make viewers feel nostalgic about high school, Disney throws even more nostalgia in there for fans of ‘80s rom-coms with an ‘80s prom theme. Littered with various “promposals” that are visually exciting, “Prom Pact” is a high school experience that allows one to live vicariously. Ambition has served its purpose here; “Prom Pact” is in.

No. 11 USC men’s volleyball is sure to face a tough test this week when they travel to BYU for two games against the No. 7 Cougars Thursday and Friday. 
The Trojans are 1-5 in true road matches this season and 0-5 in road matches against teams ranked higher than them. The Trojans know they need to find their groove away from home with postseason play on the horizon. 
“It’s about finding the right balance of our team’s chemistry when we’re on the road,” said senior libero and team captain George Dyer. “I think that’s really important because once we get the team chemistry on the road the same as when we’re at home, we’re gonna be killer.” 
The trip to Provo will be the second-furthest distance the Trojans will travel all season. Fortunately, they have a good opportunity to be very competitive against a talented Cougar team. BYU has gone through a similar season as the Trojans, with some wins that show they can play with anyone but with some devastating losses revealing some holes in their roster. The Trojans know that the Cougars are dangerous but not without flaws. They have done their homework and will try to exploit those shortcomings this week. 
“[The team’s] ability to absorb and learn and apply has grown exponentially from day one to now,” Head Coach Jeff Nygaard said. “We want to make sure that we’re able to apply it night one and night two.”
The Trojans will look to rely on their blocks and defense, which has become one of the best in the country. The Trojans are 10th in the nation with 2.3 blocks per set and hold opponents to a .273 hitting percentage on average. Against Long Beach, the Trojans held a team that usually hits .342 to just a .260 hitting clip. 
“The backbone of our team is the fact that we can do a nice job defensively,” Nygaard said. “We’ve shown that consistently.”  
The anchor of that defense has been Dyer. With such a reliable defender ever-present on the court, the rest of the Trojans are emboldened to match his aggressiveness defensively. 
In addition to always being ready to make a point-saving dig, Dyer hopes to savor the road trip experience with his team. As a senior, it is unclear how many more of these trips Dyer may have in his career, so he’s savoring this one. 
“I’m with these guys, they’re crazy, they’re nuts but they’re my team,” Dyer said. “I’m really just excited to enjoy it, we got two matches away at a fun place, fun environment; BYU is really exciting.” 
The Trojans are hungry to make the trip unforgettable by pulling off an upset or two. Whether they win or lose, the X-factor will likely be their offensive play. 
“Right now, we’re holding [other teams] to low defensive standards, but we’re not finishing it up with offense,” Dyer said.
So, the Trojans have set a clear offensive goal and have worked day in and day out to reach it. 
“We all know full well what our goal is, we want to get our offense north of .300,” Nygaard said. “If we can couple .300 plus [hitting] with the block and defense, then we’re going to peak at the end.”
Trojans fans hope USC breaks out offensively this week, and they will find out Thursday and Friday at 6 p.m. at Smith Fieldhouse or on BYU TV.

It already feels like Eduardo Camavinga has been around for a long time. For a 20-year-old, that’s absurd.
I first heard Camavinga’s name after his club at the time, Stade Rennais, defeated Thomas Tuchel’s Paris Saint-Germain in the second match of the 2019-20 Ligue 1 season. Camavinga — at just 16 years old — recorded an assist and earned the man of the match award in a 2-1 victory. Keep in mind he had already made his professional debut during the previous season. He became Stade Rennais’s youngest-ever player, for a club with a youth academy that has also produced the likes of FC Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembélé and French international Yann M’Vila.
We’ve seen Camavinga progress and improve for almost four years now, and other teams should be terrified because he still has multiple levels left to unlock in his game. 
Camavinga can play any position in the midfield and has even done a stint at left back for Real Madrid and the French national team. In the 2022 World Cup this past November, French Manager Didier Deschamps trusted Camavinga, who had only made five international appearances to that point, to substitute for Theo Hernández and play the position for about 50 minutes of the World Cup final.
For some players, their versatility hurts their career prospects, as coaches fail to find their absolute 
best position and simply use them to plug holes as they arise. That’s not the case for Camavinga because he can play across positions without sacrificing quality in his main role: the deep-lying playmaker. 
I use the word “role” here, not “position,” with intention. Camavinga plays his best in midfield, but his nominal position does not matter. He could play the number 6 position behind two advanced midfielders, or he could play in a double pivot in a 4-2-3-1 formation to equal effect. He could even play further forward in a more overtly attacking space. Either way, Camavinga can receive the ball from the defenders, carry it through midfield and play silky passes into the attackers or have a crack himself. 
Camavinga’s lightning-fast footwork is what separates him from other all-action midfielders. He steps and slices with the ball quickly, allowing him to open up spaces that didn’t seem to exist the moment prior. The way he chops and changes direction in the midfield makes opposing players look foolish for even daring to step near him. That’s why Real Madrid shelled out €31 million to sign him from Stade Rennais in the summer of 2021.
His dribbling proficiency shows up in the numbers too. According to FBref, Camavinga completes 2.64 progressive carries per match (when a player takes the ball 10 yards forward or further) and successfully dribbles past players 1.58 times per match. The first figure ranks in the 89th percentile among comparable players, and the second is even more impressive, at the 945th percentile. 
Camavinga posts these numbers while sharing the midfield with some other excellent dribblers. His teammate Luka Modrić is one of the best midfield dribblers ever, and Federico Valverde is no slouch either. As Real Madrid’s youngest midfielder, one would forgive Camavinga for ceding touches to Modrić and others, but he takes an active and aggressive role in Madrid’s attack. 
The Frenchman also has a calm yet fiery demeanor that deserves merit. During the 2021-22 season, Camavinga was not always starting matches for Madrid, especially in the Champions League. With Modrić, Toni Kroos and Casemiro in the team, any young midfielder would find it hard to win starts. But instead of kicking a fuss or sulking, Camavinga played a crucial role in Madrid’s Champions League-winning campaign. Manager Carlo Ancelotti relied on him to be a super-sub. In three successive rounds, Real Madrid had come-from-behind victories that probably wouldn’t have happened without Camavinga. He played just 125 minutes in the Champions League knockout matches, but in that time Madrid scored eight goals and conceded just once. 
If he made himself indispensable without even playing full matches, imagine what it will be like when Modrić retires, and Camavinga is handed the keys to the castle. 
Real Madrid won three straight Champions Leagues from 2016 to 2018. Cristiano Ronaldo played a huge part in that, but it was the steely midfield trio of Modrić, Kroos and Casemiro that sealed their dominance. With Camavinga at its core, Real Madrid could have the best midfield for another decade, and Madridistas must be salivating. 
Alongside Valverde and Aurélien Tchouaméni, Real Madrid already has the core of their next title-winning squad. With dynamic forwards like Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo ahead of them, the sky is the limit. Predicting any club to win three straight Champions Leagues is a fool’s errand, but if anyone can do it twice in two decades, it’s Real Madrid. 
Whatever level of success Real Madrid achieves, Camavinga will be the midfield engine making it happen.

It only takes one TikTok to go viral — one goofy trend, one catchy song, one funny joke.
Sometimes, though, it’s outside-the-box content that best finds social media success; something so specific that the algorithm catches its creativity and specificity and delivers it to the exact users who will love it.
That’s exactly what happened to USC’s Men’s Ice Hockey club team, whose TikTok account has accumulated about 12,800 followers and over 717,000 likes. This was mostly thanks to a quirky video where the players, in uniform and on the ice, pretend to read hockey romance novels by the best-selling Canadian author Elle Kennedy.
The guys on the team found the idea a little embarrassing and worried that if other teams found the video they’d be ridiculed.
“They can’t embarrass you if this gets a million views,” Chloe Higgins, one of the team’s two TikTok managers, told them.
The video gained a few more than just a million views. To date, it has over 2.9 million and well over 5,000 comments. For perspective, only one post from the official USC Athletics account has received more views than the BookTok post.
The idea came from Higgins, a junior majoring in American Pop Culture. A few years ago, she started reading Kennedy’s hockey romance novels, making her want to go to a hockey game. Instead of seeking out Los Angeles Kings tickets, Higgins investigated the club’s Instagram and found the TikTok account Issac Magallanes Sr., a junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering, had started for the team.
Higgins knew she could improve the account, so she reached out and offered her help. She roped in Anna Lokken, a sophomore majoring in Theatre (Acting), as her production partner and the two got to work. Lokken typically films the content, then Higgins edits and posts it, managing the analytics and general strategy.
With the book TikTok, Higgins specifically wanted to target a female audience.
“Why aren’t we marketing towards women?” Higgins asked herself. “Women love sports just as much as men, if not more … people need to be marketing towards women. So, when I took over the account, my whole thing was like, ‘what do I want to see from an account, what do I think is funny?’”
As a fan of Kennedy’s books, Higgins knew she had an idea that would work. And Higgins and Lokken are not just one-hit wonders; Two other videos have over 480,000 views, and all but one of their posts has over 10,000.
But to understand why a social media presence has become so important to the team, one has to look back a couple of years to the coronavirus pandemic.
After a forced hiatus for the 2020-21 season, when USC did not have any in-person activities on campus, the club had just one returning player for 2021-22. Jacob “Jake” Abene, the former club president and captain of the team, built the club back up from nothing during the 2021-22 academic year. After a challenging first year back, Abene passed the club leadership on to current co-presidents graduate student Chris Chow and Declan Driscoll.
Driscoll, a junior majoring in biological sciences and economics and the team’s alternate captain, was one of the first members of the club’s new iteration and has helped carry on Abene’s rebuilding work.
“[Abene] was kind of a role model for us,” Driscoll said. “[Trying] to rebuild the traditions, try[ing] to create our new traditions … I think that year, that very first year back, we only had 15 skaters including him, and so we had to build this club back from the ground up physically … and culturally, in terms of establishing traditions and figuring out how to operate the team.”
Running a club team has no shortage of challenges. For one, having full attendance for games can be a struggle, as players try to balance school and team commitments without the administrative support that the University has in place for varsity student-athletes. Driscoll and Chow do their best to schedule around the chaos, but even then not everyone can make it week-to-week.
“[I]t’s not always easy to be able to commit the time to even once-a-week practice and twice-a-weekend games,” Driscoll said. “We try to limit our travel to once a month, we don’t play hockey games on the same weekend as a home football game to try to increase opportunity or availability for players … we take midterm seasons into account, so we try not to schedule travel in and around midterm seasons.”
Even when they work around conflicts in the schedule, there’s no guarantee that everyone shows up. At the team’s American Collegiate Hockey Association Division 2 Pac-8 playoff game against the University of Utah in Spokane, Washington, the team was not able to bring their deepest squad. Due to midterms and injuries, the Trojans were left short-benched against a well-stocked Utes team and the Trojans lost in the first round.
To win in hockey, a sport known for its on-the-fly substitutions and rapid shifts, you need a deep team so that everyone stays fresh. A full roster is crucial to success, so a team needs to continue to attract players and establish a physical — and, especially these days, online — presence.
That’s where Magallanes stepped up. Magallanes effectively stumbled into his role as the de facto head of social media. The executive board was having a meeting at the team’s end-of-year banquet when Issac walked past and Chow semi-jokingly asked him if he wanted to be the social chair.
“I just kind of rolled with it,” Magallanes said. “I got the social media accounts from our then-captain Jake Abene … and started looking at other hockey accounts, like [the University of Michigan] and [the University of Washington], and I was just seeing what works for them.”
Magallanes thought he was up to the challenge and started developing graphics templates for the team’s Instagram and broadcast livestream. He even made a few TikToks himself before Higgins reached out to him, offering her help. When Higgins and Lokken proposed the famous BookTok video, Magallanes remembered being skeptical.
“I remember looking at it the first time and thinking, ‘I don’t get it,’” Magallanes laughed in hindsight. “But obviously they knew what they were doing.” The book’s author even reached out to the team after discovering the video, who reposted it on her social media and retroactively paid the team for promoting her books.
The enhanced Instagram presence has already paid dividends. When junior Miles Salzgeber knew he was transferring to USC, one of the first things he did was find the team’s account and used it to reach out to Magallanes. Now, Salzgeber has become a dedicated member of the squad.
When it comes to the team’s social media success, Higgins appreciates that not only does it benefit the team, but it’s helped her on her career path as well.
“As much as we help them, I think that they definitely [help] us. At least for me, I had no sports social media [experience] and that was the job that I wanted to do. So they really helped me hone my skills and be able to put something on my resume,” Higgins said. “It’s symbiotic.”
The hockey team is proving that the function of club sports is not just to help athletes continue playing at a high level, but to give members burgeoning opportunities to build a grassroots following that brings communities together, both in-person and beyond.
Above all, the most important thing to Driscoll is that the team keeps playing, so he wants to be sure he leaves the club in good hands.
“I try to remind myself of that a lot, just trying to leave the team better than I found it, and I think social media is a great way to do it.”
Now, the club has an eight-member broadcast team to stream their games. Even more crucially, Salzgeber believes that the club has done the hard work of self-discovery and will hit the ground running next season.
“I think it’s just a matter of finding our identity as a team and as a program, and I think that we definitely found that this year. So I think going into next year, we know what that is, we identified that and we can just keep the ball rolling,” Salzgeber said.
“We’ve got nothing but good times ahead.”

With less than three weeks left in the NBA regular season, several former Trojans will be important in their teams’ pushes to make the playoffs. 
DeMar DeRozan, Small Forward, Chicago Bulls
The Chicago Bulls currently have a record of 36-39, putting them 10th in the Eastern Conference. Despite winning seven of their last 10 games, the Bulls would still be in a play-in spot for the NBA playoffs if the season were to end today. DeMar DeRozan is a key reason behind the Bulls’ good month. Averaging 24.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game this month, the 13-year veteran is playing some of his best basketball at the most important time. The crown jewel of DeRozan’s March performances was his 49-point, 14-rebound game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. If his shooting and efficiency remain consistent, DeRozan can give the Bulls the momentum to make noise in the playoffs. 
Evan Mobley, Power Forward, Cleveland Cavaliers
Even though they were comfortably in contention for the fourth seed in the NBA playoffs since the All-Star break, Evan Mobley’s Cavs didn’t let up, winning eight of their last 10 games and virtually locking up their spot in the playoffs. Mobley has been a steady rock for the Cavaliers all season, and it was the same in March, where he is averaging 18.3 points, 9.4 rebounds and a strong 2 blocks per game. The Cavs are a game and a half behind the Philadelphia 76ers to claim third place in the Eastern Conference and with a relatively easy remaining schedule, they might be able to take it.
De’Anthony Melton, Shooting Guard, Philadelphia 76ers
Speaking of the 76ers, USC alum De’Anthony Melton has started 56 games on a true NBA championship contender. Melton has been a crucial part of the Sixers’ rotation as a guard who can play with both the starting and bench units. Currently shooting 37% from 3-point range and ranking fourth in the NBA in steals per game, Melton will be a “glue guy” for a Sixers championship run. Down the stretch, the Sixers face a tough schedule, including games against the Milwaukee Bucks and Boston Celtics — which may preview potential playoff matchups. As someone who can score at all three levels of the floor, Melton will likely be needed to help provide the Sixers with a spark off the bench. 
Kevin Porter Jr., Shooting Guard, Houston Rockets
Porter Jr. is on the opposite side of the playoff picture, with his Rockets holding the second-worst record in the NBA. Though it will be a season to forget for Rockets fans, Porter Jr. has put up solid numbers. On the year, he’s averaging 18.5 points per game on 43% efficiency. The Rockets are currently in tank mode in an effort to secure a better draft pick and a chance at the projected number one prospect: Victor Wembanyama. Porter Jr. and the rest of his team will need to improve their efficiency and team play in the future.
While these Trojans are all certainly in different places in the playoff race, it will be compelling to see how it all plays out for them in the final weeks of the NBA season.
