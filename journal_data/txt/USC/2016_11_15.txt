Students, faculty and staff discussed the next steps facing America following the results of the presidential election at a public
forum Tuesday afternoon in Wallis Annenberg Hall. “The 2016 Presidential Election: Where Do We Go From Here?” was hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, and was moderated by Dean Ernest J. Wilson III, Director Sarah Banet-Weiser and Director Willow Bay.
Wilson emphasized that the event was an opportunity to discuss the challenges in the days following the election and to exchange ideas in an effort to understand why Donald Trump was elected president.
“We think this is a critical time to have an important discussion,” Wilson said. “The three of us emphasize the word ‘discussion,’ which is listening as much as speaking.”
Banet-Weiser opened the discussion with a call to action: to use much of the outrage that people are feeling over Trump’s victory in order to come together as a community.
“Now is the time for the sixth stage of grief — organizing, channeling sadness into anger and channeling anger into productive conversation,” Banet-Weiser said. “A university is a space for scholarship and activism, a space for reflection, and it is a space to create community. That is what our commitment is to our students here at Annenberg and overall here at USC.”
Bay encouraged the audience members to think about the next steps that they would take to make change at USC, as a microcosm of the change they want to see in the U.S. as a whole.
“Starting right here, how do we create the kind of community, the kind of school at Annenberg, the kind of University, the kind of country that we want to have?” Bay asked.
The moderators considered why Trump’s victory seemed to take so many people by surprise and brought up the idea of an academic and left-leaning “bubble” that leaves people in universities and urban areas around the country mostly unaware of the largely differing opinions of people in rural areas. Many of these people formed the central part of Trump’s voter base and asked the moderators and the audience how to break out of their bubble and go about opening up dialogue even with the opposition. 
Annenberg professor Judy Muller said the solution would rely on journalists covering areas they have largely ignored.
“In journalism, we need to get out into areas we don’t understand,” Muller said. “I live a good portion of the year in Colorado in a rural community, and I am sure half my neighbors voted for Trump. We need to start sending out students where they don’t feel comfortable.”
The end of the discussion focused on the type of academic offerings Annenberg hopes to deploy in response to these challenges to journalism. Annenberg Assistant Dean Gordon Stables discussed the school’s vision in creating the proper curriculum and in giving students the tools to engage with societal issues.
“Look for those classes that give you the tools, the background and the knowledge, and if not, hold us to offer the classes,” Stables said. “Three years ago, the communication faculty started gathering together and saying ‘we find it difficult to talk about social change, because our lived experience does not match our students’ lived experience.’ Find [a faculty member] and make us offer the classes.”
Gabrielle Stieglitz, a junior studying public relations, said she believes that it is time to open dialogue on both sides and to understand what incentivized supporters to vote for Trump.
“I think discussions like this on a college campus are really important, especially at USC because it is so diverse in the terms of Trump supporters [and] Clinton supporters,” Stieglitz said. “I don’t want to go into January being scared out of my mind — I want to be prepared for what is coming, and not only in a negative way. I want to hear from other students who are in the same position but on the opposite side of the spectrum.”

On Wednesday, the Women of Troy will look to follow up Friday’s season opening win over Hawai’i with another victory against UC Riverside. While most early non-conference play is against somewhat inferior competition, the Highlanders provide a solid test for USC. Last season they went 23-9, going undefeated in Big West play and making an appearance in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament. The program has undergone a massive turnaround after going 6-23 just three seasons ago. 
“They run a motion with a lot of screens, both stagger screens, backdoors as well as shuffle cuts,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “We’ve got to be really effective with defending the screens as well as putting pressure on the ball.” 
Last Friday, the familiar faces for the Trojans showed up to play. Junior forward Kristen Simon recorded a double-double, scoring 16 points and snatching 10 rebounds, while redshirt senior guard Jordan Adams scored 11 points while shooting five-for-six from the field.
“I just try to be the glue. I just try to hold everyone together,” Adams said. “I know that, consistently, your shots won’t always fall and you’re not always going to have the best games, but I just come in with energy and effort and leadership.”
In addition to the veteran players, freshman guard Minyon Moore and forward Ja’Tavia Tapley performed admirably in their debut games. Moore had 8 points, while Tapley scored 10 along with five rebounds. Each played extended minutes, showing that they will be integral to this year’s success regardless of their experience. 
Even though USC played quite well in last week’s season opener, shooting 50 percent as a team and receiving 32 points from the bench, Cooper-Dyke knows there is a lot of room for improvement. 
“I want to play solid defense, aggressive defense, passing lane defense so that we don’t have to worry about teams playing in the half court defensively,” Cooper-Dyke said. “We can run our fast break and get out in transition. I want to improve defense. I want to improve our rebounding and then I want to be able to, in the half-court, attack more efficiently.” 
After playing UCR at home, the Trojans will embark on an extended road trip. First, they head to Las Vegas to play UNLV on Saturday and then travel to Anchorage for the Great Alaska Shootout on Tuesday. 
“We traveled a lot during Italy (this summer), and we got a really nice bonding experience,” Adams said. “I think everyone is excited to get back on the road and spend time together again and really just get back to finding out who each other are. That’s the one thing that’s beautiful about playing on the road.” 
Wednesday night’s game will tip off at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center. With the long road trip, the Women of Troy do not play at home again until Nov. 27 against Long Beach State.

Saturday was about as good as it gets for USC football fans. The Trojans were clicking in all phases of the game, and are finally looking like they are living up to their full potential with such a talented roster.
While the win was a huge victory, and a great sign for the program going forward, there was one notable downside for the Trojans, or at least the conference: The Pac-12 might not have a seat in the conference championship anymore. 
The chance to upset the No. 4 team in the country is obviously great. But with the loss, Washington fell to No. 6, out of a playoff spot. The win propelled USC up to No. 13, but the Trojans are still sitting on three overall loses. Colorado, Washington State and Utah, the other three conference representatives in the Top 25, are all sitting with two losses. 
All in all, this could mark the second year in a row the conference does not have a representative in the College Football Playoff. It would be not because the conference isn’t strong or respected, but ironically because it is so deep from top to bottom that it’s almost impossible for a team to make it out of the conference slate unscathed and as a clear-cut favorite for the national title. 
Last year, it was Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and Michigan State that all emerged as the conference champions in the SEC, ACC, Big 12 and Big Ten, respectively. Stanford was the Pac-12 champion, but had two losses on the season — a non-conference loss to Northwestern at the beginning of the season and one loss in conference to Oregon. That was enough to settle the decision for the selection committee, even though Stanford had looked strong all season. Sure enough, Stanford demolished the Big Ten’s representative, Iowa, in the Rose Bowl, while Michigan State and Oklahoma mustered very weak showings in their semifinal games against Clemson and the Tide. 
The Huskies could very easily still make it back into the Top Four. The Apple Cup matchup with Washington State will actually be a great game for the first time I can remember — a far cry from when the two teams had a combined one win before their meeting at the end of the 2008 season.
If the Huskies can pull off a win this weekend against a .500 Arizona State team then cap off the season with a big rivalry win, they would still win the Pac-12 North and earn a spot in the conference championship game. Depending who they face in that matchup, they could have an opportunity for another big conference win — and possibly a redemption.
They could hypothetically still be on the outside looking in at that point. Alabama is as safe of a bet as there is in college football right now, they should easily hold on to their top spot in the standings — especially with a non conference cupcake against Chattanooga this weekend as a nice, quasi-bye week before Iron Bowl.
Both Michigan and Ohio State currently sit ahead of the Huskies, but that won’t last. Those two now both have a loss, and both will be going head to head before the end of the year. Unlike if they were both still undefeated, there’s no way both of them make it to the playoff. I can only imagine how crazy of a game that will be between two ultimate rivals.
The real challenge will be with Clemson and Louisville. Louisville’s only loss right now is to the Tigers, and have otherwise been flawless in the ACC. Clemson not only has their marquee win over Louisville, but has a really bad loss to Pittsburgh. Because of the head to head win, Clemson would take the divisional title in the ACC Atlantic Division — Clemson and Louisville are in the same division. So hypothetically, Clemson could win out, win the ACC Championship game and cement a playoff spot, while Louisville could still slip into the fourth and final spot.
The Big 12 will likely be the odd conference out this year — as it was during the first CFP. No team out of the conference has less than two loses at the moment. The question for Pac-12 fans is if the ACC can slip in two.
The chances of anyone other than Washington jumping into the playoff with a conference championship is unlikely. Washington State would still be at two loses even if they beat Washington and won the conference title game.
For USC, it’s almost a mathematical impossibility to jump into the playoff. But the Trojans’ path to the conference championship is actually very feasible at this point. If Washington State can beat Colorado this weekend, that would leave us in a three-way tie with Utah atop the division. Then if Colorado beats Utah in the final week of the year, we would have the head to head over Colorado to claim the title. If Washington State can’t help us out though, then the Utah vs. Colorado game will be a de facto play in for the championship game. Either Colorado would finish as the only one-loss team in conference play, or Utah would have the head to head tiebreaker over USC and Colorado.
This hypothetical, of course, is all dependent on the Trojans taking care of business against UCLA. This was the exact kind of game head coach Clay Helton was hired to win, and he needs to make sure the win over Washington doesn’t distract or get to the heads of any players on the road in a rivalry game.
When former Athletic Director Pat Haden promoted Helton to the full time head after a win over UCLA last year, but before the Pac-12 title game, it drew some criticism. Helton helped put away a lot of that this past Saturday with his first marquee win. Fox Sport’s Gus Johnson reminded viewers of Haden’s words on the broadcast as the clock ticked towards zero. 
“And for the record, Pat Haden was right, Clay Helton is the coach of USC,” Johnson said.
It’s maybe a tad early for that superlative after just one head-to-head win for Helton over Washington head coach Chris Petersen. There’s a lot of football left in the Pac-12 slate. Heck, the two just might get a rematch before the season is over.
But so far, Helton sure is looking more and more like the right guy for the long run. He may have cost the Pac-12 a spot in the playoff this year, but he’ll hopefully add another Pac-12 contender to the mix for years to come.

With a new No. 13 spot in the College Football Playoff rankings, the Trojans kept their focus on the field ahead of their rivalry matchup against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday. The Trojans kept practice light, with just shoulderpads, but focused on honing their game plan.
Rivalry Week
Even though USC’s (7-3) coaches and players have tried to maintain level heads about the rivalry game with the Bruins (4-6), no one can deny the weight of this game.
“This is the next game for us, and it’s an important game for us. We have to be able to take this game and treat it just like we did the entire month of October and the past two games in November,” head coach Clay Helton said. “We understand it’s a special game for both universities as well as this city and we’re honored to be a part of it. It’s one of the greatest rivalries in the country.”
For many of the players, the rivalry runs as deep as what color players and coaches wear to meetings and practice.
“The other day we had a player who was wearing blue and at least six guys snatched his shirt off,” junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said. “It’s that serious.”
Smith-Schuster said that the coaches talked to the team today to prep them for rivalry week and to help them refocus so they don’t get distracted by all the action off the field, and Helton confirmed that this is one of his biggest focuses heading into practice this week.
“Rivalry games are so awesome for college football and for our fans and that’s one of the challenges this week is to keep your kids focused,” Helton said.
Shifting focus
The Trojans’ recent success can’t be denied after knocking off then No. 4 Washington on the road last week.
One of the hottest teams in the Pac-12, USC’s six-game win streak has coincided with the team refocusing and trusting each other according to Smith-Schuster.
“After the Utah game we had a team meeting and from then on we made a commitment to one another, the staff and everyone who is a part of this program, that we’re going to put trust into one another,” Smith-Schuster said. “As you can see now, it’s actually working, we just have to keep it going.”
Lotts of love
Junior three-way player Adoree’ Jackson was named the Lott IMPACT Trophy Player of the Week for the second time this season it was announced on Tuesday. Jackson played a critical role in the Trojans’ 26-13 win over the Huskies including two interceptions. Jackson also had three tackles and one pass defended.
On special teams, Jackson returned three kicks for 59 yards and recovered a blocked field goal 17 yards. He also played on offense and earned a first down for USC on an eight yard run.
Jackson is tied at the top of the Pac-12 for interceptions with four this year.
Last week, Jackson was named  semifinalist for the Lott IMPACT Trophy.
Injury Report
Helton had a long list of injured players, but he expects most of the players to be available by Saturday.
On the defensive side of the ball, junior defensive tackle Josh Fatu, who is battling an ankle injury, is 50/50 at best for Saturday, Helton said. Redshirt senior defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu and sophomore cornerback Iman Marshall were limited for a knee and hamstring issue, respectively.
Helton said junior cornerback Jonathan Lockett is working himself back from a hip injury and he held sophomore linebacker Porter Gustin out of practice to rest his ankle. Junior safety John Plattenburg also did not practice because he was sick.
Offensively there were far less injured Trojans. Helton said sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett was battling through a sprained knee. Sophomore running back Ronald Jones II was limited because of a knee bruise.
Haden hospitalized
Former athletic director Pat Haden was hospitalized Tuesday morning after experiencing lightheadedness. USC sports information director Tim Tessalone said Haden was alert and talkative.

Back in late June, images of shocked British millennials flooded our newsfeeds when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union by a narrow margin, mostly due to the high turnout of older generations. Here in the U.S., we promised ourselves that we would not make the same mistake. But fast-forward  to Nov. 8 — college students, from Berkeley to Pittsburgh to Los Angeles took to the streets declaring that President-elect Donald Trump was “Not [their] president” and “Love trumps hate.” 
But when the dust from these protests finally settles, we will still be faced with the same challenges. While we may not be able to change the electoral result, millennials can and must influence the political heartbeat of our country.
 This was supposed to be our election. This was the year that those aged 18-35 would, for the first election, match the baby boomers’ share of the electorate. We would demand that our voices be heard. But only some of us got the memo. 
Although millennial voting data in this election has yet to be fully compiled, we already know that in many battleground states the millennial share of the electorate decreased since President Barack Obama’s reelection in 2012. For example, in Arizona, it shrank from 26 percent to 15 percent. This low millennial turnout, among other factors, put a wrench in Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s and many young people’s dreams of clean energy and debt-free college and colluded to elect a deeply unpopular president in the eyes of young voters. In fact, only 37 percent of them cast their ballot for Trump, and, if only millennials voted, Clinton would have cruised to White House with 473 electoral votes to Trump’s 32. President-elect Trump may surprise us all and backtrack on many of the promises and proposals that infuriated young people, such as his proposed ban on Muslims and his denial of climate change, but as of now he has left the majority of a generation jaded, frustrated and deeply concerned for the future.
At the very moment when our civic participation never mattered more, a sense of disenfranchisement and hopelessness pervaded. Before the election, many decried how their votes “didn’t matter.” But now, with a surprising and devastating result, the pessimism and disengagement runs even deeper.
The silver lining is that this is the wakeup call that we all needed. Back in the 1960s, college campuses were hotbeds of student activism, with young people playing vital roles in the protest against the Vietnam War and in the fight for civil rights. That’s not to say that we’ve been silent since then — young people actively supported and helped lead the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements. But now we need a significant overhaul in how we think about and participate in politics.
The easiest and arguably most important course of action comes the following years: vote. Even though a national election remains a distant four years off, midterm elections, historically known for low turnout, will in just two years hold the key to how the government develops policy at the national level. In addition, local and statewide elections also provide a tremendous opportunity to register opinions, as local and state candidates and policies often impact everyday lives more than national ones do. Yet civic participation only starts at the ballot boxes. The other 364 days of the year, millennials must take a greater stake in the current state of politics. Volunteering with campaigns can elevate candidates that represent you and your beliefs. Through petitions and discourse, the internet provides a wealth of opportunities to engage with governance. Donations to human rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union are vital in supporting social justice work across the country. And work as simple as volunteering helps build relationships, trust and community in a country sown with disunity.
Millennials: Remember, remember the eighth of November. Remember the fear, pain and shock of the 2016 election and remember the consequences of inaction. But also remember the words of Winston Churchill: “We are masters of our fate.” Clinton may have lost the election, but we must not lose hope and the values that we cherish. It’s up to us now.
Uh…careful what you ask for.  We all see what happens when millennials act as seen with recent protests.  Millennials…this election is a positive thing for all of you.  All of your lives you have been given participation trophies and told to turn to government programs to solve your problems. You are soft and don’t know how to be “you” with out someone telling you how to be you. You can thank Obama for that.  Take this as an opportunity to find yourself, support yourself and think for yourself.  You don’t need big government.  Obama just wanted you to think you did.

Every American presidential election we see the same widespread disillusionment with the two-party system. Somehow, we always seem to end up with two of the least palatable candidates imaginable (though that might just be because we look at them for too long). We have a choice between two modes of thought we don’t fully agree with, and the American people wind up being “forced” to figure out which is the lesser evil.
Waxing philosophical, it may be that choosing the lesser of two evils is simply the reality of politics. But pragmatically, there are a couple of very strong reasons why the two-party duopoly is here to stay, regardless of how unpalatable it is. Everyone hoping to make a real difference in politics would do well to accept it and work within that system.
It’s not really a question of ballot access, campaign finance laws, lack of funding or manipulation of media (though I admit that there are ways to make it easier for third party candidates to appear on the ballot through electoral gimmicks, and that more funding would be helpful for getting third party candidates elected). We could pass electoral reform legislation and help third parties get access to campaign funding, and generally the two-party system would still dominate our politics. Heck, we could abolish party organizations themselves, and something looking like the two-party system would still form.
There are a couple reasons for this, but the biggest one is that it’s in the structure of the U.S. Constitution itself. We have a presidential system of government, in which the legislative and executive functions are divided, and in which the presidency has strong policymaking power. It’s been that way since the days of George Washington. In such a system, ultimate policymaking power is focused within the presidency itself, and as such, the ultimate goal of any faction is to control the presidency.
But most factions are too small to win the majority of votes required to win a presidential election. Even if we didn’t have the Electoral College, they’d still need a majority of votes. So factions lump together in coalition with other factions to get the 50-plus percent of votes they need to get someone elected to the presidency. For various reasons, these sorts of coalitions have to be assembled before the election of the president; parties are the easiest way to organize those coalitions.
But there’s another reason. When we talk about diversity in America, we often forget that the most internally culturally diverse group in the country is Anglo whites — the Puritan-descended cultures of New England and the Northern Tier differ substantively from the Scots-Irish-descended cultures of Appalachia and Texas, and so on and so forth. These cultural groupings, among others, tend to divide along not only regional lines but partisan lines. The Deep South has never been in a political coalition with New England, and both tend to compete for the loyalties of Middle America at different points in history.
The fact that there is such a cultural polarization between the highly individualistic cultures of the South and West and the highly communitarian cultures of the North, and that these are demographically dominant groups, virtually ensures that in a constitutional system based on over 50 percent of coalitions, one of the coalitions will have a Northern base and the other will have a Southern one. The South did not successfully secede, so for better or for worse, we will always deal with cultural polarization of some form in our politics.
On the face of it, having a perpetually two-party system based on incompatible cultural groupings seems dismal for moderates.
The key is a political temperament that realizes that no one will get everything they want, but everyone should get something. What is required is a temperament that sees politics as a way to balance different factions against each other to keep them from destroying each other, and thereby preserves liberty; not a view that society is a project to be improved and perfected in pitched, apocalyptic battles between opposing forces.
Unfortunately, both the left and right in America today tend to wax utopian, believing in their missions as something like divinely-ordained. The pragmatic establishment, meanwhile, is unable to cope with changes in our political economy and technology that are influencing how we organize politically. There’s need for a tempering on both sides and a reform of the middle; and politics being the art of the possible, that means working within the two-party system we are condemned to and blessed with.

Lincoln Jesser is a name growing as quickly as the electronic music scene. Born in La Quinta, California, Jesser chose to pursue his dreams of writing and producing music at USC. He was quickly discovered by Indie Pop, a Los Angeles-based music management powerhouse with whom he worked with to release his debut EP, New Blood, in 2012. Jesser has utilized music platforms such as Spotify and SoundCloud to spread his music to a larger audience, with his single “Time Will Tell” (featuring Samuel Jacob) having over 2 million plays on Spotify. Though he’s put out several singles over the past two years, fans have been waiting for another EP since he completed Modern Color in 2014. This coming Friday, Jesser’s heavily anticipated EP Casa Mirage will be released, and in an interview with the Daily Trojan he provided more insight into the exciting process behind it.
Daily Trojan: How is your upcoming EP Casa Mirage different from Modern Color? 
Lincoln Jesser: I worked outside of myself a lot more on Casa Mirage, featuring a bunch of my friends’ vocals, which I didn’t do on Modern Color. Collaborating brought in a lot of vibes and influences that weren’t there on the first album. On Casa Mirage I was also looking to channel more energy from the desert where I grew up.
DT:  What was your favorite part of creating this EP? 
LJ: Working with other peoples’ amazing voices! That, and the EP really just unfolded itself very quickly on the back end. It’s always really cool to experience a flow of new ideas like that.
DT: Is there a tour being planned with the release of Casa Mirage?
LJ: Nothing on the books yet but likely very soon.
DT:  What advice do you have for college students who want to enter the EDM world of music? 
LJ: Do what makes you happy and what you think is cool. Don’t chase what’s hot, people see right through it.
DT:  Do you think that your music has been influenced by the growth of Spotify streaming and SoundCloud use? 
LJ: Definitely. A few years ago especially, SoundCloud and HypeMachine really helped launch my music to the internet and gave me my first chances to tour. These days, Spotify shows me a ton of love and it’s a similar dynamic.
DT: When did you first begin creating music? Has your process of songwriting drastically changed since then?
LJ: I started writing my own songs around 14. It just seemed like a natural way to process what I was feeling and going through. It felt like taking off layers of clothing. I wouldn’t say my process has changed a ton since then, I’ve just tried to refine it. 
DT: You’ve worked with artists like Yuna and now Quiñ, what is the process of collaborating with other artists like? This EP features a lot of other songwriters and vocalists, how did you go about choosing who to work with? 
LJ: It’s always different depending on the collaborator, but the successful collaborations tend to be fun and somewhat easy. I guess that’s why I chose to work with a lot of friends who I’ve been thinking of working with for some time now.
DT: What are your goals for the next year? 
LJ: To make more music that people love, and to learn how to levitate.

Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. Every year, I look forward to spending time with my parents, celebrating the day with family-specific traditions. We watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade while demolishing scallion pancakes, a Chinese side dish. For dinner, we trade Thanksgiving Turkey for Thanksgiving Peking duck. And at night, we winnow through the Black Friday newspaper ads in search of deals worthy of waking up at 4 a.m.
This year, that vision will look different. Instead of going back to the Midwest, I will be spending my Thanksgiving break in Shanghai, China — my birthplace.
With a 14-hour flight at the end of the week looming, I started wondering what it would be like to have an “abroad at hometown” experience. I’ve been back to Shanghai on numerous occasions since my parents and I immigrated in the late ’90s, but apart from some family I have there, the city lost the connotation of home long ago. In fact, every time upon arrival, displaced from my familiar surroundings, I experience intense culture shock. That’s why, while entertaining the thought of studying abroad, the prospect of spending a semester in China filled me with as much trepidation as anywhere else.
To glean what that experience would be like, and to prepare for my upcoming trip, I visited Chinatown this weekend.
Old Chinatown in Los Angeles is interesting. Tucked between Downtown and Echo Park, the area feels almost desolate — I half expected tumbleweeds to drift through. It’s a far cry from the bustle of the Chinatown in San Francisco or New York City. These jam-packed streets almost bear resemblance to those of China.
In Old Chinatown, there are whispers of the busy community that once was. The buildings, peeling with faded paint, speak to the neighborhood’s storied past as a commercial haven to Chinese businessmen in the late 19th century. At the heart of Central Plaza, there’s a statue honoring Sun Yat-Sen, the father of the Republic of China and hero to many Chinese revolutionaries. But on that Saturday night, more than a century after the neighborhood was founded, only low-grade energy occupied the mostly abandoned Broadway Street.
That’s not to say Old Chinatown is completely devoid of worthy places to visit. My friends and I had dinner at Plum Tree Inn, and immediately upon entering, the restaurant’s atmosphere reminded me of venues where we had our family reunions. The place was occupied mostly by families, and it was clear that sitting down, conversing with close ones, was integral to the restaurant’s experience. All that was missing was a Lazy Susan.
Our dinner spread was a cornucopia of dishes that rivaled the comfort of my mother’s cooking. The first entree, the Plum Tree deluxe, a stir fry of chicken, beef, pork and various vegetables, featured complementary flavors. For a dish that required so much oil, it was surprisingly light yet flavorful. The steamed fish filet, garnished with ginger and scallions, came later, and it was followed by the shrimp noodles. We could have done without the last dish due to the vast portions, but that’s to be expected with any Chinese restaurant.
Chinatown might not have been the most exciting part of Los Angeles, but it underscored the values my parents raised me with. On our way back to the car, we carried on our hours-long conversation started at the restaurant. It was then that I felt more at ease and excited for my impending trip abroad, one without our Thanksgiving customs, but celebrating family no less.

If you live in California, you’re probably aware of the avocado shortage that’s heavily affecting avocado lovers everywhere. Due to a worker’s strike in Mexico and an exceptionally dry season in California, many growers have had limited avocados to sell this season. The shortage of avocados, or “guacapocalypse” as some people have begun to call it, is a huge upset for tons of people. These times are a struggle for avocado fans like myself, but we will survive. Avocados are not only delicious — they are also packed with fiber, potassium, and heart-healthy fatty acids. They really are one of the most versatile foods. Below is a list of things you’ll understand and relate to if you are truly obsessed with avocados.
