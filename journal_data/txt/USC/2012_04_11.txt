Two graduate students were fatally shot early Wednesday morning in a car in front of a residence on Raymond Avenue near 27th Street.
The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene in the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue shortly after 1 a.m., where one female, 23-year-old Ying Wu, and one male, 23-year-old Ming Qu, were found shot.
Wu and Qu were transported to California Hospital Medical Center in Downtown Los Angeles where they were pronounced dead.

Officers found Wu inside a late-model BMW 3-Series and Qu outside of the vehicle.
At some point after being shot, Qu fled from the car toward a nearby house to seek help, LAPD Cdr. Andrew Smith said.
LAPD said the suspect at large is male. No other details or descriptions have been provided about the suspect.
There are no yellow-jacketed security ambassadors patrolling the area near the crime scene.
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said two video patrol cameras and two license plate recognition cameras are stationed in the area, but not directly on Raymond Avenue. DPS turned over all camera footage to LAPD.
“We are saddened and outraged at this horrific act,” Denzil Suite, associate vice president for student affairs, said in a statement. “I encourage us to pull together as a community for support and comfort during this difficult time.”
Wu and Qu were both studying electrical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.

“As a dean and professor but also as a Viterbi parent, this news hits me very deeply,” Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos said in a statement. “On behalf of the school, I want to express my strongest sympathies to the families of the victims, all our students, faculty and staff and the university community. I know that the entire Viterbi community, around the world, has been shaken by the news.”
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, and Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, released a joint statement to the USC community Wednesday.
“Our community is saddened and outraged by this callous and meaningless act, Jackson and Dickey said. “Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims’ families and friends and all who knew them at USC.”
Mourners placed flowers in front of Wu’s house on Raymond Avenue throughout the day and gathered for a candlelight vigil Wednesday night at Tommy Trojan.
In response to the murders, Carlisle said more officers will patrol the area where the shooting occurred. Per DPS Chief Carey Drayton’s orders, a “public safety kiosk” was placed at the intersection of 27th Street and Raymond Avenue, where officers will be stationed and surveillance footage will be taken.
Suite said the university has contacted Wu and Qu’s families and offered full resources should they wish to travel to Los Angeles.
“They’ll have to make some determinations whether that is feasible for them, but we’ve let them know that whatever they want to do, we will help them in that endeavor,” Suite said.
Those seeking counseling or other support can call Student Affairs at (213) 740-2421 or Student Counseling Services at (213) 740-7711.
Those with information on the shooting are asked to call  Southwest Area Homicide investigators at (213) 485-2417.
Are some of you slow or just dumb? There is not racial injustice and no one was arrested because we don’t know who did it. Most likely if someone black did it, they would be arrested. In the trayvon martin case, a man, with a gun, with a history of violence, and vendetta for black males or “assholes, or coon” oh I mean punks, killed a kid minding his business with skittles and ice tea. I don’t care if the boy was kicked out 20 times and wore his pants sagging he didn’t deserve to be killed minding his business. You guys are evil hypocrites, if it was your loved one how would u feel? Today is history regarding va tech, that dude was asian and killed several of all races, what about serial killers and child molesters? They kill and harm many, where’s your disgust and outrage. Maybe if they were profiled or even paid attention to instead of all emphasis on blacks we can get a better handle on all this!
This tragedy should be a wakeup call to USC leaders who do far too little to protect the lives of innocent students.  The university should either sell its property and move to a safer part of LA or
else it should buy up more land in the ghetto surrounding USC and build adequate  and affordable
housing for USC undergraduate and graduate students. If these dead graduate students had been
offered the option of living in a safe and affordable graduate student high-rise or apartment complex owned
by USC, they would probably be alive today. How much land does USC own on Catalina
Island? Perhaps a large chunk of its programs can move there and safe student
housing can be made available on the island.  If USC really must remain in the ghetto, then why isn’t the school building a high quality graduate student high-rise directly across the street from campus? USC’s reputation depends largely on the quality of the graduate students it attracts from all over the world. If USC does not act immediately  and decisively to prevent another senseless tragedy like this, the global pipelines it relies on for top graduate students will never again work so well.
@mark cruz how do you know the killer is possibly black, where you there, did you see the killer. upon what do you base your assumption. I am saddened by this killing and yes it deserves the same outrage and media coverage that the Trayvon Martin case received. why don’t you Mark, and your fellow students start a petition, set up a reward for any information that could lead to the identification of the killer, and demonstrate and continue demonstrating until the authorities do something. contact your Asian political figures and light a fire under them to start asking questions. Call Fox News, CNN, ABC news, CBS news and make them pay attention. blog about it, start making noise on facebook, do whatever is within YOUR POWER to get the word out about this murder. This is a terrible tragedy and the slain Asian students deserve justice.  but it is wrong for people to compare this to the Trayvon Martin case, the two cases have NOTHING IN COMMON! DON’T BE STUPID AND IGNORANT! don’t start speculating and spreading rumors that the killer is possibly black when YOU DON’T KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. TO DO THAT IS THE HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY, AND DARE I SAY IT RACIST.
Statistically speaking, we know very well that a certain class of people are (substantially) more likely to commit crimes than others. Of course, one does not yet know the racial background of the killer. That is why he QUALIFIED his statement with ‘possibly’. And he would not be too off the mark, if ESTABLISHED STATISTICAL FACTS are anything to go by.
This looks to be a nice area of West Adams from the photo.
I wonder if two students that are not international students but white, American born, living on the Row got shot – if USC would be responding differently today.
Thank you for saying so,we need to be treated equally and we also need truth.
Unfortunately this story will not receive the Trayvon/Zimmerman-media treatment unless the killer is white with a swastika tattooed on his face and sworn to hate Asians. Tragic killings happen everyday as this despicable double homicide shows – but the media does not stay interested unless they can relish over a juicy racism angle.
Why aren’t Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton in LA organizing demonstrations and demanding justice for these victims?
Don’t be ridiculous.  The situations are entirely different.  Both are sad, but in Trayvon’s case, the killer was known and free/not charged with a crime.  That’s not the case here because no one knows who did it.  Who are we supposed to demand be arrested?
if the killer is caught, and his last name is a zimmerman, goldman, steinman or whatever -man, i can guarantee the so called free media will try to call him a hispanic just as long as there’s that 1/16th blood connection to Latino descendancy.. but then again, the shooter may in fact be an asian, or black, or a bonafide white/jew.
I’d like to know more about the students and their backgrounds.

The USC men’s basketball team officially announced the signing of guard Brendyn Taylor on Wednesday, marking the third member of the Trojans’ 2012 incoming recruiting class.
Taylor, Los Angeles native, averaged 18 points, five rebounds and 3.5 assists, while leading Fairfax High School to a 20-10 record last season. He is ranked as the No. 17 player in California by Cali High Sports.
“Brendyn has a great upside,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said in a statement. “He is an athletic wing who’s best days are ahead of him. He is going to be a major plus both on and off the court for USC.”
Wednesday was the first day programs were able to sign players to binding national letters of intent as a part of the spring signing period, which lasts until May 16.
Taylor, who committed to USC last month, is the son of Brian Taylor, who played 10 seasons in the NBA and ABA, and the younger brother of Bryce Taylor, who played at Oregon from 2004-2008.
He joins a current recruiting class for the Trojans that also includes forward Strahinja Gavrilovic from Kragujevac, Serbia, and Wake Forest transfer J.T. Terrell, a 6-foot-3 combo guard. Terrell has spent this season playing for Peninsula College in Port Angeles, Wash., where he has averaged 24.4 points per game.
Both players signed during the early signing period in November.
USC still has one scholarship to offer and is pursuing former Tennessee forward Renaldo Woolridge, former Drake guard Rayvonte Rice and junior college center Renan Lenz, according to ESPN LA’s Pedro Moura.
Good grief what a bunch of mid major caliber players. Is this really the best USC basketball can do? The Galens must be awfully upset they donated all that money only to watch morons like Pat Haden and KO run this program into the ground.
Meanwhile the Ruins just picked up the top Bball prospect in the nation in Shabazz Muhammad despite Muhammad’s dad being a Trojan alum.  
KO MUST GO!

On Saturday, USC will host the annual Swim with Mike event at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium. Each year, the event is held to raise money for the school’s Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund.
The event started in 1981 and has been held for the past 32 years. Though many students and Trojan affiliates are familiar with the event, the vast majority of people don’t know why Swim with Mike exists or what it means to thousands of handicapped college students around the country.
Warrior · Though Mike Nyeholt was paralyzed in an accident in 1981, he decided to help those who were put in similar situations. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information
Swim with Mike is named after Mike Nyeholt, who graduated from USC in 1978. He was an All-American swimmer in his time on the swim and dive team, and was working as a business professional after his time at USC ended.
In 1981, he was involved in a motorcycle accident that left him paralyzed for the rest of his life. It appeared that Nyeholt would never live normally again. The former All-American who helped USC win three national championships was, for all intents and purposes, dead in the water.
But Nyeholt was not so quick to give up. Ron Orr, one of Nyeholt’s friends, started a Swim-a-Thon event so that Nyeholt could pay his medical bills. At the time, the event was called Swim for Mike. In its first year, the event raised nearly $60,000.
[Correction: A previous version called the first year of the event Swim with Mike. The event was initially called Swim for Mike. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
Nyeholt did not need all of the money, so he created a fund for the extra money aptly called the Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund. The event was held the next year.
And the next.
And the next.
It was renamed Swim with Mike, as Nyeholt became a participant in the event, swimming with those that wished to raise money for the charity. The rest, as they say, is history.
Nyeholt’s foundation has raised $12.1 million since the first Swim for Mike event in the early 1980s. With that money, 116 scholarships have been awarded to students at USC and schools across the country that demanded life not come to a halt when they became paralyzed.
This year, the event is being held on the same day as the football team’s spring game. So, it would make sense that the hoopla would be at the Coliseum.
Not exactly.
The USC marching band will be at McDonald’s Swim Stadium, as will all the cheerleaders and several USC athletes. Swim and dive coach Dave Salo will be there, as will several USC gold medal-winning swimmers.
No, the point here is not to miss senior quarterback Matt Barkley throwing passes all over the field for a swim event.
Rather, the point is to realize how incredible Swim with Mike is and to recognize the amazing opportunities it has provided.
And beyond that, to recognize Nyeholt for the great things he has done.
Nyeholt and the entire project should serve as an inspiration. It would have been easy for Nyeholt to adjust his lifestyle and to cut swimming out of it.
But he refused. He wanted to swim and wanted people to know that just because certain parts of their bodies didn’t work, didn’t necessarily mean that they had to cut out large parts of their livelihood.
Nyeholt will likely be at the event Saturday, as will hundreds of participants who want to give hope to those who could easily have given up. But Nyeholt would never let that happen to people he sees in the same position as he was more than 30 years ago. It would not be right.
Swimming is not all he does, though. Nyeholt is now the senior vice president for sales and marketing for the Capital Group Companies. The fact that he is in a wheelchair does not mean that he pities himself. Instead, he went and lived his life on his own terms and made sure that thousands of people with paralysis across the country could follow suit and do the same.
In the same way that Nyeholt will be out in the sun Saturday morning, cheering people on to swim as far as they possibly can, Swim with Mike is there to cheer people on so they know that a paralyzing injury is not the end. In fact, for special individuals like Nyeholt, it sometimes marks the beginning of a greater journey.
And that journey is something that we, as Trojans, should all embrace and be incredibly proud of.
 
“Goal Line Stand” runs Thursdays. If you would like to comment on this story, email Michael at katzml@usc.edu or comment below.
I think it was at first called “Swim for Mike” then later renamed “Swim with Mike” when he joined in the event.

Though the USC men’s and women’s tennis teams have dominated the collegiate tennis scene, another squad from USC hopes to make some noise on the national level.
USC’s men’s and women’s club tennis squads will send 10 players to Cary, N.C., to participate in a 64-team draw at the United States Tennis Assocation National Tennis On-Campus Championships, which begins today and ends Saturday.
Medical school student Jordan Rees and freshman Colin Tseng will pair up in men’s doubles alongside seniors Ashley Ohira and Madeline Segura in women’s doubles.
Tseng will also join graduate student Amber Brightly in mixed doubles. Sophomore Dave Warren and senior Amanda Ellis will play in men’s and women’s singles, respectively.
Sophomores Alden Mitchell and Yaron Steinfeld will also travel with the team as alternates, while junior Allen Jebsen will serve as captain for the squad.
“It’s a really cool atmosphere [at Nationals],” Jebsen said. “You just feel like you’re part of USC. When you go there, you represent USC, and that’s what makes me want to play my best.”
Match play will model the World TeamTennis format, in which every match consists of five sets of six games, with each set devoted to either men’s doubles, women’s doubles, mixed doubles, men’s singles or women’s singles. A team wins based on total games won, rather than sets won.
The tournament begins with round robin play in a pool of four teams. After three matches in one day, the teams will be divided into four separate brackets based on their pool record.
Once sorted into either the Gold, Silver, Bronze or Copper bracket, the teams will face off in a 16-team playoff over two days. The last one standing in the Gold bracket will be crowned champion, a title that USC has yet to take in the tournament’s 12-year history.
On the first day of play, USC will face a pool comprised of James Madison University, Northeastern University and the University of Missouri—Columbia.
USC’s club team, which practices four hours a week at Marks Tennis Stadium, hopes to go far in the tournament after the team had to back out of the Nationals last year.
Segura, who also serves as president of the USC Tennis Club, will be going to the Nationals for the third time.
“It really is an experience that I will take with me forever,” Segura said. “I think we will do really well. I presume we’re going to come back with very successful results.”
USC’s club team, which consists of 25 members, is part of the bigger USC Tennis Club, which offers a source of competitive tennis for more than 250 members of all talent levels.
“The competitive aspect is really nice,” Steinfeld said. “But it’s also just nice to get away from the studying scene and all of that, and be able to come here and play tennis with some of my closest friends.”
While the next three days will feature some stiff competition in the likes of reigning champion UCLA and five-time champion Texas A&M, USC lacks no confidence in its title chances.
“We’re going to win it,” Jebsen said.  “ We’re going all the way.”

After a triumphant Senior Day for the squad’s four graduating members, the top-ranked Trojans begin their final weekend of the regular season at Long Beach State, taking on the 49ers.
The Trojans (20-4, 16-4) are currently alone atop the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation standings, and swept the 49ers (14-13, 9-11) when the teams met in the Galen Center early February.
The Trojans might be in the middle of a 15-match winning streak, their longest since the school record of 30 from 1990-1991, but every match is still a must-win matchup.
“The ability to control our destiny is a weight off our shoulders, but we want to win the league outright,” said senior co-captain and middle blocker Steven Shandrick.
The squad will win the MPSF championship and home-court advantage throughout the MPSF tournament by winning its last two matches against the 49ers and at Cal State Northridge on Saturday. A victory Thursday ensures that the Trojans will be playing at the Galen Center for at least the first round of the tournament.
Despite the resounding result of the teams’ last matchup, the opposing 49ers are not to be taken lightly.
“It will be like playing ourselves,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “We’re systematically very similar.”
A key player the Trojans will need to limit will be outside hitter Taylor Crabbe, who is among the most skilled players in the MPSF and will challenge the Trojans with his fast hitting and impressive jumping ability.
“This team is scary,” Ferguson said. “One night they’ll play off their game, the next they’ll come alive and challenge any team in the nation. They’re a much better passing team now than they were when we played them in February, so we need to serve tough and keep them out of their system.”
As far as rotations, the Trojans will finish the season by continuing to interchange at the opposite hitter position.
“We play the hot hand from whatever works out in practice,” Ferguson said. “We’re already in the tournament mentality, and we want to play like it,” he added.
This was especially prevalent last week, when redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski started and played the entire match Saturday against UC Irvine after having a fantastic practice Friday.
Mochalski did not play Thursday against UC San Diego in favor of junior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin, who came off the bench Saturday and played for redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Tanner Jansen for the final two sets.

A year ago, Aundrey Walker was big — really big. He weighed in at 375 pounds — the heaviest of anyone on the Trojans’ roster by about 35 pounds.
The sophomore offensive tackle felt all 375 pounds, too.
“By the fifth play I would be gasping for air,” said Walker, who appeared in 11 games for USC last season.
But this spring, Walker has felt lighter than usual after shedding nearly 60 pounds during the offseason from December to March. Credit a new and improved diet filled with meats and vegetables.
“He’s completely different,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “When you lose 60 pounds, you move a little bit better.”
Photo courtesy of Sports Information
A more nimble Walker, who is now listed at 320 pounds, has battled junior Kevin Graf to secure the Trojans’ starting left tackle spot — a position vacated following Matt Kalil’s decision to enter the NFL draft.
For the time being, though, it appears as if the position will be occupied by Walker, who has been tasked with protecting senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s blind side.
Last week, Kiffin announced that the Cleveland native would remain at left tackle for the foreseeable future and at least for the duration of spring practice, which culminates with Saturday’s annual spring game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“He fits better over there with his length and his size,” said the Trojans’ third-year coach. “When you look at prototypical left tackles, that’s what they’re built like. Hopefully he can get used to it over there.”
If anything, Walker will have to get used to life on the left side, as replacing Kalil, who projects to be a top-five pick in this month’s draft, won’t be easy.
A season ago, Kalil was instrumental in paving the way for senior tailback Curtis McNeal, who ran for 1,005 yards on only 145 carries. Perhaps just as impressively, Kalil was a part of an offensive line that allowed just eight sacks all season.
Walker is aware of the challenge.
“It’s a blessing,” Walker said. “It’s a great opportunity to play left tackle after Matt Kalil. I’ve got some big shoes to fill.”
Nonetheless, through just a handful of spring workouts, Walker appears to have a solid grasp on the position following the often talked about open competition with Graf.
For the first week of spring practice, Graf started at left tackle, while Walker was inserted at right tackle. For the second week, they switched positions, and though Kiffin initially said they would rotate over the subsequent weeks, they haven’t exactly done that.
Meanwhile, Graf has taken recent events in stride.
“I’m going out there and doing what the coaches ask me as hard as I can every day — no matter where they put me,” said Graf, who started 12 games at right tackle last season. “I’m taking it one day at a time.”
Walker has said similar things.
“The goal was to help the team in any way possible and to just get on the field,” he said. “I’m still working to get better.”
Despite his left tackle frame at 6-foot-6 and 320 pounds, Walker is at left tackle full-time for the first time in his career.
A season ago, as a freshman, he was a backup on the offensive line, rotating in at a couple spots, and also played on special teams. In high school at Glenville High in Cleveland, he played right guard for a run-oriented team — contrasting the Trojans’ pro style offense, which often relies on the passing game and the left tackle as a result.
“The first day was kind of iffy,” Walker said about his new position. “Over the course of the days, I have felt more comfortable and I feel like I’m doing well.”
Similarly, Graf is adjusting to life on the right side.
“I feel comfortable at both,” Graf said. “I feel more comfortable at left, but I know I can play right tackle, too. You’re still protecting the quarterback and not letting him get hit.”
But no matter how comfortable both suggest they are on opposite ends of the offensive line, Kiffin insists the two have plenty of catching up to do, calling both tackle positions a “work in progress.”
Luckily, it’s still spring.
“I’m going to keep working,” Walker said. “Those words are motivating me to maintain the spot.”

An album shouldn’t have to resort to coaxing its listeners into enjoying it, yet the sophomore effort from electro-punk duo Grand Duchy does just that. Frank Black, the former frontman of The Pixies, rejoins his wife Violet Clark for Let the People Speak, which presents itself as the feature debut on a radio station hosted by DJ Jonathan L.
Musical letdown · Grand Duchy, composed of The Pixies’ former frontman Frank Black (left) and wife Violet Clark (right), fails to impress with its sophomore album Let The People Speak. The new release proves dull and lackluster with few standout tracks and uninspired musicianship. - Photo courtesy of Wesley Curtis
The result is contrived, awkward and amateur at best. Jonathan L crowds the empty space between tracks with mindless babble and even takes a staged phone call from a caller with an artificial European accent who swoons, “I love Grand Duchy. Play some more.”
But that’s not to say that the radio-block gimmick is interrupting much substance to begin with.
When Clark drops statements such as “if Petits Fours [the duo’s first LP] was missionary, Let The People Speak needs to be doggy style,” the album should pack a punch — or at least live up to the hype that’s been generated for it. And when band members share an offstage romantic partnership, the onstage collaboration promises a certain intimacy, passion or coalescence that draws from what’s real. Black and Clark fail to reach any of these potentials.
After Jonathan L’s “all around the world, live” introduction fades, the album launches into a series of disparate synth lines, electric guitar riffs and melodies that comprise a combination of shrieking, moaning and panting.
It’s not the pairing of these three components or Clark’s half-chanted, breathy trills that make the album fizzle. In fact, the combination is a signature sound of Canadian rock band Metric and its lead singer Emily Haines, whom Clark clearly channels as she steps into her own as a vocalist.
Instead, the duo’s pitfall stems from tired lyrics, empty inspirations and overall lazy composition. On “Illiterate Lovers,” it’s possible that Clark takes a shot at reminiscing about failed relationships to accentuate her marriage with Black, but the song never seems to ignite. Clark sounds downright sophomoric when she croons, “Illiterate lovers / You never read me right / Go back to night school.”
The lyrics get progressively worse as Let the People Speak trudges reluctantly forward. On the penultimate track “ROTC,” Clark sabotages any glimmer of her lyrical potential with lines like, “It isn’t every day / You throw a big soirée.” Even Jonathan L seems to think this blemish needs a bit of lifting, or perhaps he’s just being sarcastic when he raves, “Any song that has the word ‘soirée’ has got me. It just kicks my ass. I love that word.”
Unfortunately, Jonathan L ends up drawing more attention to a gaffe that epitomizes Grand Duchy’s lyrical inexperience.
Let the People Speak isn’t hopeless. The album features a couple of tracks — most notably, “White Out” and “Silver Boys” — with catchy hooks and touches like the staple triple-clap rhythm popularized by most alternative-dance anthems.
And on “Geode,” Clark attempts to slow the album’s sporadic pace with some sultry whimpering, but it’s still not a truly original contribution. It’s nothing you wouldn’t hear on a B-side from Stars or early Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which isn’t a bad thing. Not many artists, however, aspire to make music that sounds like another, bigger band’s lesser-known material.
What’s noticeably absent from the duo — that is, aside from any real musical, lyrical or conceptual proficiency — is a genuine second member. Black takes a backseat, allowing Clark to develop as an artist on the album. Her style, characterized by synth pop and dance beats, is drastically different from Black’s moody punk drawls, but to limited success; even the stale wit from Jonathan L commands more of a presence.
Black does step forward from his apparent role as de facto guest star with the bluesy, albeit out-of-place, number “Shady.” It’s a decent enough track, but listeners are reminded of what niche the former rocker’s trying to cater to when they hear the inclusion of Clark’s intermittent teen-girl giggle and “yeah?” pulsing throughout.
The album concludes with the title track fading to silence without any trite remarks from Jonathan L, who might just be at a loss for words. Let the People Speak is a struggle to get through, and for better or worse the album showcases all the kinks in the duo’s attempt to establish itself while highlighting Clark’s attempt to truly emerge as a performer.
“Is your glimmer kicking in?” Clark implores as she feigns insight on “Geode.”
The answer? Not yet.

Mickalene Thomas: Origins of the Universe Opening Reception
Friday, April 13, 7-9 p.m.
Exhibition Saturday, April 14-Aug. 19
Santa Monica Museum of Art
New York-based artist Mickalene Thomas makes a move to the West Coast with her exhibition Origin of the Universe.
The multimedia artist, who often experiments with various forms of landscape painting, tackles a new subject: female empowerment.
Thomas’ new exhibition explores the transgenerational female and how she relates to various environments. To do so, Thomas combines her classical art history background and blaxploitation influences with themes of femininity, beauty, sexuality and power.
Moreover, Thomas plays with classical genre conventions; she brings black female subjects into the limelight when they were previously rejected. This is seen in her piece “Origin of the Universe,” which is a play on realist painter Gustave Courbet’s “Origin of the World.”
If you’re looking for an art show that pushes boundaries and tried-and-true conventions, then Origin of the Universe is for you.
KarmetiK Machine Orchestra: Samsara
Thursday, April 12 and
Friday, April 13 at 8:30 p.m.
REDCAT
Imagine a world where we don’t go to concerts to watch people play music, but instead sit down to a show performed by machines.  Sound implausible?  Let the KarmetiK Machine Orchestra convince you otherwise.
Composer and engineer Ajay Kapur and sculptor and theater designer Michael Darling developed the show, which features sophisticated electro-mechanical instruments as well as human performers and musicians interacting with several speakers placed throughout the crowd.  The performance is actually a musical interpretation of traditional Indian folk tales drawn from the Panchatantra and the Jataka Tales and revolves around samsara, or the Sanskrit concept of life, death and rebirth.  It’s a complex subject navigated by an equally complex production, one that looks to astonish the audience and question our notions of future and past.
“We’re combining ancient traditions of dance and music with the most futuristic technology,” Kapur said to CalArts.
In other words, the best of both worlds — and what appears to be a wonderful show.  To top it all off, tickets are very reasonably priced at $16 for students.
M83
April 12, 8 p.m.
The Fox Theater
For the procrastinators out there who missed out on the Coachella bandwagon this year, have no fear.
Many of the bands playing the following two weeks in the hot, sweaty, indie heaven we know as Indio will be in and out of Los Angeles for a couple of weeks.
Though many bands will hit the city, there are a few standouts. One band hitting the L.A. and Indio scene to keep on your radar — M83.
The eccentric, electronic, pop-rockers, notable for hits such as “Kim & Jessie” and “Midnight City” — think Victoria’s Secret runway commercial, yeah you know which one — are not to be missed.
The on-the-rise music sensation shines with its dynamic flair and unique sound, making the band one of this year’s hottest numbers.
Tickets cost around $25 and can be purchased on Ticketmaster. But can you really put a price on an awesome night of adventure and charismatic music? You know the answer.
 
 
CicLAvia  // Sunday, April 15 10 a.m.-3 p.m .// Various locations
The hustle and bustle of L.A. transportation can be a bit of a drag, especially when there’s gridlock on the freeways and constant congestion Downtown. Relieve your road rage this weekend by exploring the city with some other methods of travel: on foot, bicycle and anything without a motor.
CicLAvia offers a great opportunity for Angelenos to get out and truly discover the streets of Los Angeles without the hassle of parking. Inspired by ciclovía, the successful weekly street closure program in Botogá, Colombia, CicLAvia closes off 10 miles of roadway that passes through various neighborhoods including South Los Angeles, Downtown and East Hollywood.
Past iterations of the event have also included many entertaining activities along the path, such as dodgeball, dance performances and parades, and Sunday’s CicLAvia looks to feature more of the same.  What better way to cap off the weekend?

Rest in peace..
R .I. P 逝者安息
This is so sad.  I am an American and have lived in Los Angeles more than 30 years.  It makes me very sorry that this is how we have treated these wonderful young visitors to our country who were intelligent and here to learn.  I feel sorrow for the families, friends and fellow students.  I will say prayers for these and for safety of all Chinese students in Los Angeles.  I wish I knew what I could do to help.
This is now how we treat our guests.
我们国内的暴民很想知道这两位同学的父母的职业是什么，如果他们是官二代，我们很多人表示不同情，因为官二代们用纳税人的钱夺走了本属于大众的机会。或许，你们当中就有这样的人，而且可能还不少，所以我们诅咒你们。你们是阶级不平等的牺牲品，不好意思，但是事实如此。不要那么高尚，就因为你们能在国外奋斗就了不起了？国内的人过的也不容易。
We all love u. Rest in Peace.
I want know their parents’ occupation or we us will not be in peace!
Rest in peace
REST IN peace
美国警察机构和学校加强周边的安保，尽快严罚凶手！
安息
Rest in peace! 希望所有的海外学子平平安安！
RIP.
God please give the parents faith….

Unfortunately, these two students probably never had a blunt, rude, insensitive lecture on the social economic problems of the surrounding USC neighborhoods.  But all students and their parents can be reassured that the american system of justice will go to maximum lengths to protect the rights of the criminal and those who harbor them as always.  Good luck to all students but you all are on your own more than 2-3 blocks distance away from the school’s boundaries.
Rest in peace: Ming Qu and Wu Ying.
在国内看到此消息，震惊之余也为他们感到惋惜，所以只能过来留言祝福，逝者安息，一路走好。你们在天堂不会寂寞，我们都会记得你~
希望您们在那边可以快乐的微笑，再也不用只身来扛着我们这些繁重的负担。走好
客死他乡。父母要节哀。
YING WU MING QU REST IN PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
news channels are reporting that the pair were sitting in a (quote) “$60,000.00 BMW”, which is total nonsense. they are from hard-working class families with middle/middle-low income, scraped savings for a well manicured USED BMW. how dare the propaganda media-manipulators like cnn, chinasmack, bs tang dynasty news, etc concoct the “fuerdai” idea to vilify any young chinese with a decent automobile! these were two very promising new generation of bright young people who would-could-should bring hope and progress for many people! but what moron-retard-loser have gone and pulled the trigger on these two former hopefuls? may he not get away like the perpetrators who killed Yoshihiro Hattori and Vincent Chin!
一路走好。
坏人会受到应有的制裁，祝福你们
R.I.P
Rest in peace.  With all the blessings from the HK alumni community. Fight On!
Love is strong as death. Rest In Paradise: Ming Qu and Ying Wu.
Rest in peace!
逝者安息，生者坚强。
一路走好，R.I.P.
走好。
Love, Innocence, Promise, Hope…stolen by an inhumane act of cruelty.  God, please take them in your arms and bring some peace and comfort to their family, friends and loved ones ~
RIP. I know that finding the killer won’t bring them back, but I really hope he will be brought to justice. I wish they could find him and send him off to China and let the two families deal with him. Just the thought of someone so heartless and cowardly is disgusting.
As a Trojan mom, I mourn these two brave children, who were trying to lead extraordinary lives. I pray for their families, and for the Trojan family. Let us hope that the killer is brought to justice. Let us also hope that from this horrific act comes a greater sense of unity within this community of diversity. Grief knows no borders, no social class, no race or creed.
Very well said, Catherine. Thank you.
很可惜。一路做好，希望你们能在天堂永远开心。
God bless them
一路走好
God bless you.
May you rest in peace….
God Bless them!

Godspeed to the hard working detectives and officers working on this case.

Everyone loves the indie comic scene. It serves as a great alternative to narrow-minded, studio-controlled projects and, more often than not, indie comics show artists embracing their passions or dream projects.
Independent productions are the reason why college radio stations or the Sundance and Slamdance film festivals exist and thrive. So long as major companies or established systems dominate a medium, independent creators will serve as a necessary catalyst for new ideas.
Unfortunately, the independent scene in the comics world has not been as strong. That’s not to say there aren’t dozens, if not hundreds, of creators producing exciting material, because there definitely are. The problem is that the comic book medium is a struggling one, and if someone’s working outside the established publishers or distribution routes, the challenge of creating a comic and building a solid audience is even greater.
But independent comics have been a highly influential, major part of the industry for years. Because of their separation from any major company or publisher, independent comics have more room to explore topics.
Harvey Pekar’s seminal slice-of-life series, American Splendor, started out as a self-published independent book in the 1970s. Art Spiegelman’s magnum opus Maus, a look at the horrors of the Holocaust, was instrumental in starting to change public perception that comics are more than just “kids’ stuff.”
It might not seem it, but comics can be a cutthroat scene and it’s incredibly difficult to even get a book produced. Everyone has a story they want to tell or a project they want to draw. And when certain stable companies only have so many spots or titles for creators to work on, the independent scene finds itself flooded with people trying to make their own books.
And then there’s the matter of getting an audience. Locating hard-to-find cult titles published by mainstream companies that last longer than a year is hard enough, but it’s even harder to keep independent series afloat. Readers only have so much money to spend on comics, and what are they more likely to do — spend it on titles they know they like or take a gamble and try something new? And that’s even if they have access to independent books.
The sad truth of the matter is that writers and artists are producing amazing, groundbreaking and innovative comics every year. But they get ignored, no matter what the creators or fans of the series do to expose them to a wider audience. Word of mouth can only go so far. But maybe the situation is changing.
There’s been a strong resurgence of independent comics in the last decade. Independent lines are getting more attention as the comics market starts to diversify beyond the grim and gritty superhero or action series that dominated during the mid-1990s.
Publishers such as Oni and Top Shelf are getting more attention, and independent comics, such as Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, have come to the big screen. Some of the biggest names in comics today are indie-book writers, such as Ed Brubaker and Brian Michael Bendis.
But there needs to be more done to help independent creators. Conventions such as the Alternative Press Expo are great showcases for independent pieces, but that work needs to be seen alongside more mainstream works. If a buzz starts about independent comics, it could help hardworking creators succeed and maybe work on more material if they know they have an audience.
Sure, independent scenes in other mediums give rise to people more concerned with trends than content, but that doesn’t mean indie works should be ignored. Indie content tends to be a slice of the alternative or ignored world. If superhero stories or sci-fi epics aren’t your thing, don’t give up on an entire medium — try the other options it has to offer.
A sudden spike in readership is highly unlikely for independent comics, but the greater exposure would be good for both creators and audiences. The writers and artists get a chance for their books to succeed, and readers, whether they’re longtime comic book buyers or new buyers drawn to the elements of independent books, get to check out another side of the comic book industry.
Innovation doesn’t tend to happen by using the same tools or concepts over and over. That’s true for technology and it’s true for creative works like comics. It’s time to dive into the indie scene.

Upon hearing the title of Daniel Nettheim’s film The Hunter, one would be forgiven in thinking it depicts the struggle of man vs. nature.
On the contrary, this is a postwar piece: Man has already won. All that’s left is determining how the human race reacts to the small, untamed corners of the globe left to us, and whether we learn anything about ourselves when we venture into them.
On the prowl · Willem Dafoe (left) and Sam Neill (right) star in survivor film The Hunter, a story about a man living in a post-war society who goes in search of the thought-to-be-extinct, extremely valuable Tasmanian tiger. - Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures
Willem Dafoe plays Martin, the titular hunter hired by a vaguely defined yet presumably powerful corporation to venture out into the forests of Tasmania in search of the scarcest resource the land mass might have to offer: the Tasmanian tiger believed extinct since the 1930s yet still the subject of unsubstantiated and persistent sightings by locals. It seems that there just might be one left after all, and if that’s true, then the animal’s DNA is hugely valuable.
And of course, the environmentalists in the area would go berserk if they knew the truth of Martin’s mission. In light of this, during his search, Martin masquerades as a scientist and takes up residence with a family that just so happens to be desperately seeking a father figure in the wake of the previous head-of-household’s disappearance.
It quickly becomes apparent that, though entirely in his element while on the hunt, Martin isn’t the domestic type. His compassionate side is calloused over, and because the same can be said for Lucy (Frances O’Connor), who still laments her vanished husband, the gap the two would need to bridge to acknowledge any sort of feelings they might have for each other is staggeringly vast.
Her children manage to rope Martin in as well, and though their sibling dynamic isn’t anything that hasn’t been seen before (stoic young boy who is free-spirited, a slightly older girl), that doesn’t make Morgana Davies’ performance any less adorable.
The picturesque home life this mercenary is able to gradually ease into might compel audiences to let their guards down, but it’s worth remembering the reason Martin is there in the first place — to find something worth a great deal to powerful men. The danger surrounding him, though frequently out of sight, is still a constant presence that merits more than a little consideration.
This film is a slow burn, but the pacing is necessary and very deliberate. Real hunting, after all, is mostly about patience: move slowly, absorb the surroundings, keep your eyes and ears open and appreciate what you take in at the end of the day.
Here especially, there’s plenty to appeal to the senses. Everything was shot on location in Tasmania and the cinematography gives the island its due: The wild twilit forests have a sense of the unexplored about them, and it’s easy to believe that if there’s any place on Earth a creature thought extinct for decades might turn up again, it would be here.
The sound design is also impeccable, with one scene in particular making an operatic flourish that takes other films to task for not utilizing the true power of surround sound. The aural touches aren’t just for show. Rather, they underscore the fact that Martin relies on what he hears as much as what he sees to track his prey.
Naturally, every successful hunt ends in a tension-shattering explosion of action when the quarry is found.
Whether or not the Tasmanian tiger is truly out there for Martin to discover, the slow build-up pays off as the film heads toward a final 25 or so minutes that’s driven by as much momentum as the actual takedown of prey.
There’s also an appropriately cathartic conclusion that might seem unsatisfying or trite to some, but it has a simple beauty that anyone invested in the characters will be able to appreciate.
To put things into perspective, there exists a scant three or so minutes of grainy, black and white video of Tasmanian tigers in captivity online. Officially called thylacines, the animals bring to mind striped jackals with the hind legs of a kangaroo.
The footage is definitely worth a look, and the animals have a certain litheness to their movements: a palpable and compelling liveliness a bit unlike anything else you’re likely to see. In their natural habitat, these tigers were at the top of the food chain before arriving settlers drove them to extinction. The idea that they might still be out there somewhere inspires people to this day.
If they are, let’s hope very sincerely that no one finds them: They’re safest in our dreams. Beautiful, honest and confident, The Hunter brilliantly conveys this sense — and is genuinely a dream worth seeing.
My search for the Tasmanian tiger spanning 45 years has taken me to most parts of Tasmania, including much of he areas shown in this film, which I instantly recognised. The film crew weren’t aware of just how close they really came to intruding into real ‘tiger territory’. I know for a fact that this animal still exists, having seen it in the flesh, but to tell where would be to betray one of nature’s truly great survivors. The thylacine is best left alone until such time as the relevant authorities are prepared to implement a secure and comprehensive semi-captive breeding environment. Then and only then will I disclose where to locate this elusive marsupial, which for the sake of survival, must be rescued before it is too late to save it. This animal’s future survival prospects are grim indeed as foresty enterprises and tourism constantly push back the perimeters, and soon there will be nowhere left to hide. Despite a pathetically weak plot, ‘The Hunter’ does go some way to awakening the world to the plight of this magnificent survivor, as well as the majesty of the Tasmanian bush.

American grocery stores use too many plastic bags. 
I am an international USC student from Korea. Since many Koreans are familiar with American culture through movies and music, things haven’t looked that weird to me since I arrived here. Well, one thing has. In supermarkets, all the cashiers double-bag nearly everything, including gallons of milk, which have handles! In my country, you can easily see consumers using alternatives like personal sacks, big paper bags and a self-packaging desk with unused boxes. I like things in the U.S., but why don’t you make your beautiful country even better?

USC community should support LA plastic bag ban. 
I walk my dog every morning down my street a few blocks north of campus, and even though I rarely bring one, I am never without a poop bag because I find plastic bags stuck under fences, in bushes, lying in gutters or drifting casually down the street. According to the Clean Air Council, the state of California spends about $25 million sending plastic bags to landfills each year, and another $8.5 million to remove littered bags just like these from streets. I urge the USC community to rally behind the bag ban that the L.A. City Council to will vote on next Wednesday, April 18. Call your councilmember today.

The reformation of American education usually comes with technological changes. Educational institutions search for ways to use technology to effectively improve teaching and learning. Although the efforts are well-intentioned, how much technology is truly necessary?
Jonathan Zhang | Daily Trojan
Some professors allow laptops as an option for note-taking — giving students the chance to use them for social networking — but the distraction laptops pose is not the issue.
Many schools that use laptops and other digital teaching tools do not use them to their fullest potential.
Teaching concepts through non-interactive mediums like PowerPoint and Blackboard do not prepare students for the realities of the world.
Businesses search for candidates that have plenty of work experience and can collaborate well — not for the candidates with the highest test scores and the ability to memorize and regurgitate information.
“Everything has to do with the fact that technology makes information easily accessible, leading us to take information for granted,” junior Estevan Rodriguez, a civil engineering major, said. “Students don’t remember the information; they remember how to get information.”
As PowerPoints summarize class material into bullet points, our ability to absorb broader concepts diminishes. We confine ourselves to memorizing small, easily learned portions as opposed to understanding the greater picture.
Much debate stems from students’ decision to take notes on laptops as well. Although it is easier and more efficient to type notes, physically writing out words helps the development of visual, motor and cognitive functions, according to a July 2011 article by the Huffington Post. When you physically write out words, the thinking, language and working memory regions of the brain activate, giving you a mental workout. In comparison, typing out notes is sort of like eating Doritos.
Moreover, in October 2010, the Wall Street Journal reported that writing essays by hand versus with a keyboard helps you express more ideas, write faster and use more words.
Adaptive learning combined with technology has the most potential in education. Programs can adapt to student’s individual strengths and weaknesses, much like a teaching assistant or a tutor might. However, the bulk of learning should be active learning: writing, reading, researching, group work and problem-solving, rather than sitting and attempting to absorb information.
Education should enhance students’ abilities to think critically by processing and using information in a collaborative environment. The assimilation of technology into classrooms shouldn’t hinder this goal by giving students easy access to answers — answers that don’t require the employment of creativity.

Seniors with A’s shouldn’t have to take their finals.
I’m sitting on my bed, rushing to read the first and last pages of the reading for a class I have in 20 minutes, completely overwhelmed, stressed — yet convinced that somehow it will get done. When did this sudden change of heart and perseverance occur? How have typical procrastination techniques of beginning an assignment the night before class turned into beginning an assignment an hour before class? It seems as though I have a serious problem on my hands, but after a few conversations over much-needed wine with girlfriends about the “stress” of it all, I realized I am not the only one. It’s time something is done about this.
Senioritis has officially and unintentionally taken over my senior year at USC. While many believe that senioritis is an imaginary disease seniors use as an excuse to slack off and party rather than work, there seems to be something incredibly real about it. With this and my grades in mind — and the grades of the thousands of seniors at USC and on campuses around the country — it is time to do something to combat this epidemic.
For many seniors, the prospect of “the end,” coupled with three-and-a-half years of working hard, causes an uncontrollable urge to be less motivated than in prior semesters. Seniors who already have jobs, graduate schools and future plans solidified, or who subscribe to the idea that last semester grades don’t matter as much, have little incentive to do their best in class.
In order to instill motivation, USC should implement a policy to promote new energy for seniors. If a student has an A in the class going into the final, the student shouldn’t have to take the final at all; he or she should automatically receive an A in the class.
If USC adopted this policy and applied it only to students in their last full-time semester of college, seniors would be more inclined to keep up their grades throughout the semester.
While some people might argue that this policy would lower the university’s academic standards, it would motivate seniors to actually complete their assignments.
In the meantime, I’ll be vigorously working to cure myself of this horrid disease. Back to studying!

How do you consume your dose of daily news?
In the last decade, the evolution of the Internet, mobile phones and tablets have completely changed the way we consume news.
It should come as no surprise that traditional newspapers are suffering. In 2009, newspapers made $27.6 billion in total revenue compared to $49 billion in 2005 — meaning that in just four years, the industry’s revenue declined by nearly a half. In 2011, Pew Research Center estimated that newspaper newsrooms cut their staff by 30.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Newspapers have responded by not only beefing up their digital offerings in the online, mobile and tablet space, but by exploring alternative revenue models, primarily through subscription-based services.
Ditch that expensive drink at Seeds Marketplace for a monthly news subscription and see how much you get out of it. You’d not only be helping the newspaper industry, but you’d be keeping yourself more informed and educated in the process.
Can’t pay up? While you can still read a limited number of articles free of charge, a significant percentage of the newspapers’ articles are limited to paid subscribers. These are called “pay walls,” where content is specifically blocked unless you pay a monthly or yearly fee.
While online subscription pay walls are tough on consumers accustomed to free news, the newspaper industry must experiment to stay afloat. Meanwhile, newspapers should explore other strategies to make their products more appealing — particularly to attract students and young adults.
Having joined the fray last month, the Los Angeles Times is one of the latest newspapers to implement an online subscription model by offering a one-month trial at 99 cents and a $3.99-a-week plan.
Newspapers clearly recognize that they need to act fast to combat the decline in revenues from print media. The decline in revenue, however, isn’t solely because of a drop in readership. A decline in revenue from traditional classified ads, plus the lack of growth from online ads, are both pivotal sources of the problem as well.
As a result, implementing subscription models are one way that newspapers are adjusting their business models to stay afloat.
The New York Times’ subscription program has seen the most success, with close to 500,000 digital subscribers. Alongside this growth in digital subscriptions, the newspaper’s home delivery circulation numbers have also increased. Some analysts attribute this growth to consumers’ willingness to pay for home delivery because it comes with unlimited digital access.
But newspapers must look to other ways of gaining readership. The New York Times is using creative strategies to try and tap into the college market. The publication recently partnered with USC to offer free newspapers on campus with the hope that it will increase readership and gauge student interest in world news.
Since many students are deterred by subscription fees, newspapers should also consider offering special plans tailored to students’ needs. For example, they could offer discounts to students who have legitimate college email addresses, or allow users to tailor their subscriptions based on the topics they are most interested in.
What’s evident is that a newspaper’s survival will not rely solely on a subscription model. After all, what has truly made The New York Times so successful is its commitment to top-quality journalism, great website and app design, mobile capabilities and stellar interactive features.
If newspapers can successfully integrate quality journalism with technology, they will have an easier time monetizing their business models and adapting to the changing media landscape.
Hopefully, students can shake off their indifference and recognize that top-notch, accurate journalism can’t be replaced by their Facebook news feeds.

Two graduate students were fatally shot early Wednesday morning as they sat in a car in front of a residence on Raymond Avenue near 27th Street, according to Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene in the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue shortly after 1 a.m., where one female, 23-year-old Ying Wu, and one male, 23-year-old Ming Qu, were found shot.
The victims were transported to California Hospital Medical Center in Downtown Los Angeles where they were pronounced dead.
Officers found the female victim inside the “late-model BMW” and the male victim outside of the vehicle. At some point after being shot, the male victim fled from the car to a nearby porch to seek help, according to Cdr. Andrew Smith.
Wu and Qu both studied electrical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.
LAPD said the suspect at large is male. No other details or descriptions have been provided about the suspect.
“We are saddened and outraged at this horrific act,” Denzil Suite, associate vice president for Student Affairs, said in a statement. “I encourage us to pull together as a community for support and comfort during this difficult time.”
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, and Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration released a joint statement to the USC community.
“Our community is saddened and outraged by this callous and meaningless act. Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims’ families and friends and all who knew them at USC,” Jackson and Dickey said in the statement.
Those seeking counseling or other support can call Student Affairs at (213) 740-2421 or Student Counseling Services at (213) 740-7711.
Those with information on the shooting are asked to call investigators at Southwest Area Homicide at (213) 485-2417.

I’m an alum and have been horrified to watch these events unfold, especially since I have mutual friends who knew the victims. Since there seem to be no leads on such a brazen crime until they get some sort of surveillance up, it leaves us to be more vigilant. 
Here’s a simple precaution I use in my neighborhood:
If you are coming home at night in a car, turn your high beams on and do a slow drive-through of the block. PASS YOUR RESIDENCE. Look out for unusual cars which are not normally parked there and make sure there’s no one inside. Lots of times, people looking to carjack/mug you are just waiting in their parked cars. Once you deem it’s safe, on your 2nd pass of the block, actually turn into your driveway.  *maybe* a simple precaution like this can help someone in the future prevent such a sad loss of life.
I always believe this: some people should never have been born. They came to the world with part of their humanity missing. These people should have been aborted. Hopefully, future medicinal science will enable detection of such sociopaths/potential criminals before they get born.  
It’s such a tragedy that these two young people lost their lives in this senseless crime. They came half way around the globe in pursuit of a better education at USC, with their hopes and aspirations. Yet, their lives were brutally cut short by these scums of the earth that roam the USC neighborhood. 
I feel so so sorry for them, and it’s not just because I am also a USC student from China. 
It’s as heartbreaking as the Florida incident in which 2 British tourists were shot by a good-for-nothing local teenager.
International students are given a separate orientation upon their arrival at USC. At the international orientation, USC teaches incoming students nothing about safety, and everything about how to be American. An administrator who probably couldn’t even get accepted to USC today tells International students how much an appropriate tip in a restaurant is and how American Football works. USC preps incoming international students in these mandatory sessions how to act like an American.
How about a fair warning to internationals who may not know any better that their campus is in one of the worst neighbourhoods in LA? How about a suggestion that when someone points a gun at you less than a mile off campus, it is a smart idea to just comply with whatever they say? How about a little more focus at international orientation on how to stay safe as opposed to how to fit in?
It’s too bad that the university (which just collected half a BILLION dollars in donations last year) don’t pay it’s graduate TAs enough that they can really afford to live in a safer neighborhood.  This probably wouldn’t have happened in Pasadena, Culver City, or Los Feliz.
Exactly! Luckily, I am able to commute to school from Silver Lake. My neighborhood is VERY safe and my rent is half as much as it would be if I lived in University Park.
I don’t understand why the report still talked about the “late-model BMW” thing, which had been proven as false information. The male student just bought a second-hand 9 year old car for the convenience of going for interviews. They are POOR students! Was the reporter trying to tell people they were shot because of their wealth?  Then how many USC students should be executed for the very reason in the street?! I am really ashamed of American journalism!!
That’s a good point. The LA Times seemed to make a huge deal about the car being a BMW.
… a 2003 model that he’d bought for $10k. A new Hyundai would’ve been more expensive. But they had to play up the economic disparity angle, even when little economic disparity existed.
USC has always been extremely proactive about safety, and has invested considerable resources into making students feel safe within the clasically defined North University Park neighborhood (the east of Vermont, south of Adams area, as well as the south of Jefferson, east of Normandie block).
That said, some students choose to live near campus, but outside this “security zone” (as the LA Times called it). I can understand USC’s historic reluctance in investing or diverting assets such as DPS officers away from the most heavily student-populated environs… but it always baffled me why Campus Cruiser and other university resources refused to service the area immediately northwest of campus. It was like the university was tacitly trying to discourage us from living there, but never explicitly said “hey, don’t live northwest of campus, because we’re not investing security resources there, and so it’s unsafe.” And even if they did, I wonder if the message might get lost among international students, as these victims were (rest in peace fellow Trojans).
The cost to at least extend campus cruiser to that zone would be nominal, as would extending tram routes. That chunk of the neighborhood has been completely ignored… and yet students live there. In that sense, I can’t help but wonder if this was an accident just waiting to happen.
I’m sorry but I’m afraid I have to disagree regarding USC emphasizing the safety. A lot of the programs that they come up with actually don’t work very well. The yellow-jacketed “ambassadors” either play with their phones or sleep, DPS does nothing other than driving in our neighbohood like douchbags, their response time is 1 hour at the earliest mainly because they send 10 cars to capture a homeless person collecting plastic bottles, and they still have no desire to fix the Trojan alert which failed at least half the time. It’s much better to rely on Facebook to get the latest security updates, and DPS puts this as an excuse that Facebook is doing the job that they choose to abandon. We don’t need DPS if that really is the case–I think LAPD will do a much better job in maintaining the security.
Get ready for a lot more of this, as Governor Brown, Sheriff Baca and AG Harris conspire to undo decades of progress in keeping thugs locked up.
Fred, I think you know better than to say that.
The release of convicted felons has been necessitated by overcrowding in our prisons. And overcrowding in our prisons is largely the result of a failed drug policy. The ultimate result is that we must stretch increasingly-limited resources increasingly thin. Note that the average California inmate costs the state $48,214 per year. It’s a bit more than the $7,463 the state spends per student on higher education. It’s even more than USC tuition — that’s an impressive feat to accomplish.
Meanwhile, the LAPD has a federal responsibility to pursue and arrest recreational marijuana users while violent criminals like the suspect in this story remain on the streets.
So what solution do you propose? Increase prison funding? Then where shall we cut?
“the LAPD has a federal responsibility to pursue and arrest recreational marijuana users” NOT TRUE. No one is in prison for marijuana. 14 years as a police officer and I know that marijuana possession is the same as a traffic ticket.
Then why have more than 11 million people been arrested on marijuana charges?
May them rest in peace…The US Media must apologize for their contemptible reports!!!
Contemptible reports how? 
Also, it’s may “they”rest in peace.
You must be a native speaker, you made no grammatical error. Good for you.
I sure hope the LAPD are able to catch this guy!
And if they do, we should turn him over to Chinese authorities to properly punish him!
By what reasoning would we turn over an American offender to the judicial system of another country? Asian-Americans commit the fewest crimes per capita of any ethnic group, and South Central has relatively few Asians. Asian-Americans also have some of the highest per-capita incomes, and thus have fewer incentives to commit robberies, burglaries, or larcenies. And of Asian-Americans, a rather small portion are Chinese citizens.
So I would conclude that the suspect is, most likely, not Chinese. Rather than call for a summary execution, we should be thankful the American legal system grants criminal suspects full due process rights (which is not the case in China).
My thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, and loved ones of the victims. I hope they are surrounded with support and comfort as they grieve this awful tragedy.
What a terrible, senseless tragedy. My heart goes out to the friends and family of the two victims.

Gary Ross, the writer and director of The Hunger Games, has officially passed on directing the much-anticipated sequel in the franchise, Catching Fire.
The official announcement comes from the director himself, after recent speculation about his possible departure from the franchise. The online world was flooded with rumors that he had already passed on the film because of financial reasons.
Lionsgate, the studio behind the film, was expecting to reach a deal with the director after Easter weekend.
The Hunger Games is currently number one in its third week at the box office and has already grossed over $460 million.
The decision follows in the footsteps of box office hits such as Harry Potter and Twilight, both of which were franchise films that switched things up by reaching out to other directors for their sequels.
Gary Ross revealed that his decision to step away from the sequel was because of time constraints. In an official statement, he said,  “As a writer and a director, I simply don’t have the time I need to write and prep the movie I would have wanted to make because of the fixed and tight production schedule.”
Lionsgate is moving quickly for the sequel, with plans of shooting Catching Fire as early as August.
Gary Ross says he has a number of projects in the works, but has not officially announced plans for his next film.
The director’s departure now opens up talks about a potential replacement director for Catching Fire.

Two graduate students were fatally shot early Wednesday morning in a car in front of a residence on Raymond Avenue near 27th Street, according to Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
The Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene, where one female, 23-year-old Ying Wu, and one male victim, 23-year-old Ming Qu, were transported to California Hospital where they were pronounced dead.
Chloe Stepney | Daily Trojan
[Update 11:15 a.m.] At some point after being shot, Qu fled from the car to a nearby porch to seek help, according to LAPD Cdr. Andrew Smith. The suspect in the case is said to be male. No other details on the suspect have been released.
Michael L. Jackson, vice president for student affairs, and Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, released a joint statement to the university community at approximately 10:51 a.m:
“Our community is saddened and outraged by this callous and meaningless act. Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims’ families and friends and all who knew them at USC. The university is reaching out to those affected, offering counseling and support.
The Los Angeles Police Department and our Department of Public Safety are working aggressively to solve this crime.
This incident occurred outside the neighborhood areas where over the past several years we have steadily increased our security presence, adding dozens of security and license plate recognition cameras, uniformed officers, and yellow-jacketed security ambassadors. However, tragedies such as this morning’s remind us that we all need to be continuously vigilant about safety and security.
While crime in our community is low compared to other areas of Los Angeles, we want to reassure you about ongoing efforts to promote safety in the neighborhoods around campus, including a public safety task force for students, parents, faculty and staff; a community safety task force with the USC Family of Schools; and a collaboration on public safety issues between the Department of Public Safety and the area’s neighborhood councils. These efforts, among others, have succeeded in significantly improving safety in our surrounding community.”
[Update 10:00 a.m.] Both victims were in their 20s and of Chinese descent. Richard French, a spokesperson for the LAPD, said the female was found inside a late-model BMW and the male victim was found outside of the vehicle. The LAPD received a report of shots fired in the 2700 block of Raymond Avenue shortly after 1 a.m.
[Update 9:15 a.m.] LAPD Officer Gregory Baek said they suspect the shooting was an attempted carjacking, though the investigation is ongoing.
“At this time, what we have is a tragic loss of [USC students],” Carlisle said.
Names of the victims have not yet been released as the victims’ families are contacted.
“The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear. USC’s Department of Public Safety is working closely with LAPD on the investigation,” said Carlisle in the Trojan Alert sent at 6:25 a.m.
The car where the victims were shot has been removed from the scene, where LAPD is still investigating the shooting, as of 7:45 a.m.
Raymond Avenue between 27th and 29th streets is closed to traffic.

I got my undergraduate degree from USC and lived north of campus for 1 year.  It was
not safe–especially at night but my apartment was burglarized in broad daylight
by a local teenager who tried to pry open my kitchen window. If not for my dog,
it might have ended differently.  I moved to South Pasadena and commuted–much
safer.  Parents, make sure your children live in safe areas of Los Angeles.
It’s a problem of insufficient communication between USC and the international student community. For international students, their sharing of information is largely limited by their self segregated group. It’s our school and everyone’s responsibility to help international students better adapt to their life in another country.
What a great comment you have shared – I believe that it is critical to help international students properly assimilate here at USC
But my international peers should also make an effort to assimilate with their native US classmates! It’s a two way street. I would happily give international students a run-down of the USC area (as I also got my BA here), but it is difficult when they choose to self-segregate.
Why doesn’t USC have a buddy program for international students? I’m not asking for someone to become my BFF, but I am sure international students would be more likely to associate with peers of all races and cultures if it was encouraged/mandated by a little weeklong orientation.mentor type situation.
@USC Grad Student
Another keyboard good Samaritan, aren’t you?
It might have occurred to you that not all native students are that friendly toward foreign students, and that not all of them are even willing to help out a newcomer?
This is not a time to say what if, why, or who.  It is a time to wrap our arms around the parents whose children lost their lives today.  Their agony cannot be understood or even touched upon those of us who have not encountered their tragedy.  My prayers go out to them, in a distant country, whose hope and love and faith surrounded  their children. May God’s love encircle your grief and hold you strong in the belief there was a reason.  I feel your agony and hope for your strength.

Listen when the dispatcher says “any southwest unit” since those are the officers who cover the USC area.  Discover for yourself just how much crime happens in the city of angels.
This is just an earth-shattering event. Words cannot explain what I feel. 
I did not know the individuals that were murdered… but I think that if you are a student at USC you can relate. Anyone could have been in their position…
People go to school to learn, make friends, have fun, and set up their lives… for the future….
NOT TO DIE. 
Lets pray that those individuals can rest in peace and that their families are ok. Lets also pray that justice is brought to the person who committed the crime. 
We need to be aware of our surroundings and USC needs to tell their students what locations are UNSAFE. At my orientation, USC kept saying how hard they try to keep the crime rates down… but they did not say how bad it actually was. Now that I am a student, I get a DPS crime notification 1-3 times a week… it is ridiculous. 
AHHHHHHHHH so tragic!
Although there is a huge chance that the person that murdered these innocent kids is Hispanic or Black, given the demographics of the surrounding community, that should not matter at all. This person killed and should be heavily punished for what he did, and I hope students do not start to think negatively of the surrounding USC community. Most of the locals are working class people that oppose this senseless violence and are willing to help students. 
To my fellow SC students: What’s done is done, and there is nothing in this world that will bring these kids back to life, so let’s focus on how to improve student safety to prevent more incidents like this from happening. We cannot simply just blame USC, they’re not our babysitters.. and we cannot blame the students that were killed for driving a BMW late at night. However, we have to remember, we are in South Central Los Angeles, an urban city, where violence and crime is evident. Let’s be safe and I am sure USC will flex some muscle in improving safety. 
With that being said, I hope whoever did this rots in prison.
Well said!! I think the people that commited this crime should be lined up and shot!!!  Why waste taxpayer money on killers and losers!!!!  I am sure the USC security and LAPD will work hard on solving this senseless crime.  My prayers are with the families of these two young individuals.
Really sad and angry to hear about this senseless act of violence.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.
I REALLY hope they catch the scumbag that did this. I’m tired of innocent people being robbed, hurt, or killed by some stupid thugs. 
To concerned parents and prospective students, I’d like to give my opinion regarding safety in the area. On the whole, I would say that the area surrounding campus is not as safe as many other college towns. There is a lot of crime in the area, mostly theft, but if you are careful, you should be okay.  USC has beefed up security off campus in recent years, hiring security to stand on street corners and monitor the area as well as installing lots of surveillance cameras (mostly south of campus). I think this has helped, but more could be done. There are certain parts of town that are worse than others and that should be avoided (North and West of campus in particular). Campus itself is pretty safe. USC DPS (department of public safety) has a strong presence on campus and regularly patrols off campus. 
Safety concerns should not deter you from attending USC or sending your kids there if you like the school. I lived in the University Park area for 4 years, received a great education, and had no problems at all. Following a few simple rules can make things a lot safer:
1) Avoid the problematic areas (North and West of campus), especially at night. Avoid living in these areas or even hanging out in these areas. 
2) Do not walk off campus after dark if you don’t have to. Definitely do not walk around alone…. even small groups (2-3) can be a little risky when it’s late. Take advantage of the Tram service or Campus Cruiser whenever possible (it’s free!). If you must walk at night, walk in groups and avoid small dark streets (walk along main streets as much as possible!). 
3) Be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Keep doors locked. Close windows when you aren’t home. Don’t leave valuables in plain sight (especially in cars). 
The bottom like is do not allow yourself to become a target. You don’t have to live in fear, but if you live in the area, realize that you need to be more careful. A little vigilance goes a LONG way.
I agree with most of what you wrote except for “problematic areas.”  The fraternity and sorority houses are north of the campus and students live in every direction surrounding the campus.  To suggest people should avoid living or hanging out there is ludicrous.  Students have to live somewhere.  They just have to be aware of their own safety and follow common sense advice.
You’re right! I meant south of campus.
Avoid SOUTH of campus. Security north of campus (near the row), has been improved.
Correction: 1) Avoid the problematic areas (SOUTH and West of campus), especially at night. Avoid living in these areas or even hanging out in these areas.
Correction: I mixed up North and South.
I graduated in 2006 from the business school.  I ALWAYS took Campus Cruiser when I needed to go off campus after dark, no exceptions. Campus Cruiser is the USC car escort that was clearly marked “Campus Cruiser”.   I lived on 29th and Ellendale for about seven months and even though this area is populated overwhelmingly with SC students, gangs and thugs still roam this part of the ‘hood.  
After moving to Pasadena, I parked off campus on 29th and Hoover since most students live in this area and I didn’t want to pay the parking fees  to park on campus.  I always called Campus Cruiser to take me to my car after class.  Pasadena is a great area to live for SC students since you can take the Metro during the day and if you need to go on campus at night, it’s only a 20-25 minute drive.  
Be careful, do not live by campus like these students, and ALWAYS use the Campus Cruiser!
I applied to USC last year, and one of my qualms with the school was its safety issues west of campus after say 10pm. Sure, if you are black and a middle class family living in a neighborhood full of minority middle class families, chance is you’ll be fine. But if your a rich white/black/asian whatever USC student driving around at 1am in a dangerous part of town, the likelihood of you getting robbed/raped/murdered increases, that’s a fact. So yeah we may be privileged and thats exactly why people get pissed off and thats exactly why people rape, murder and rob us. Why would you rob a poor person? You wouldn’t. Why would you murder two, probably wealthy, asians? Because rich people piss off poor people. If parents of USC students are too blind to instruct their sons and daughters not to drive around in neighborhoods where us privileged folk are not common then your not doing your job. Theres a reason Elon students don’t drive around in burlington late at night…and it’s the same reason why USC students shouldn’t be driving around in neighborhoods where they are not welcome.
While I agree with much that you have said, hello? USC is mixed with its community – living next to campus is not always possible. If you actually came here, you would understand.
I am a parent of a usc student , I love the school but this is the schools responsibility as someone else said  for affordable safe housing and protection in the surrounding neighborhood. these students deserve safety in crossing streets, affordable housing and safety to get to  their housing..
I have a friend whose son was just accepted to the university.. i had pushed usc and now I do not until usc protects their students from robbery , assault, rape, getting hit and killed crossing the streets and now gunned down and murdered. of the few friends I have that their kids go to USC now. 1 was raped, 1 was robbed and beat up and left unconscience in an alley, another one was just robbed in his own house just a block off campus. enough is enough . my heart and my prayers go to the family and their friends, I am so saddened today.
It is not fair for these kids to work their whole life to get in a  good school, choose USC when they had other options and then to have to not be safe to walk or drive like any one  deserves to be. shame on you USC. keep the students safe… too many crimes! too many victims.
I agree with you USC needs to provide affordable parking spots for students in safe areas.  This would be easy to do immediately so students dont have to park and walk so far away. The tuition is expensive enough. They ought to be able to throw in some free parking on campus where the students feel safe.
My son is considering a transfer to USC from UC Berkeley.  I’ve heard all the rumors about the “bad neighborhood” and have looked at crime stats online and it doesn’t look encouraging. However, I have driven around late and night and like the heavy security presence on most street corners.  I’m sure everyone has different experiences, but what’s the real feel in the area?
This is such disheartening news–my thoughts are with the victims’ families.  I graduated from USC last year.  The first year, I lived at the Radisson hotel dorms, which weren’t so bad–aside from my tires getting slashed in the “secure” parking structure and getting 2 bikes stolen; however, when I moved a block off campus (near 36th street and Catalina), it was very dangerous.  My roommates and I called in a mugging that we heard going on outside once.  I moved out of the area there after only a year, which I’m glad I did since two non-usc student related shootings happened on the corner near my old apartment the following year.  
The campus itself is safe–there were only 1 or 2 instances of muggings on campus during my time there (most late in the evening), and there are many campus security and LAPD cars patrolling the areas; however, I would suggest that if your son cannot live on campus, you look at nicer apartment complexes downtown or even in another area entirely (I moved to the South Bay and decided the commute was worth the added level of safety).  There’s nothing wrong with being overly cautious–stories like this are so sad :(
Sorry–I should also throw the disclaimer out there that while the above detailings were MY personal thoughts/experiences, it should not serve to classify the area as a whole.  I’m sure others living on that street and in the surrounding area may say they’ve had no issues.  So I am simply sharing my personal experience living off campus near USC.  
Thank you.
The university campus is relatively safe and the immediate streets around campus are patrolled regulary by LAPD and USC DPS.  Go beyond these streets and it’s the wild west, especially after dark.  As others have stated, anything west of Vermont is unsafe.  USC is in the heart of south central, now known as south LA to be politically correct.  It’s the haves vs the have nots, plain and simple.  If your son transfers, I would suggest commuting from South Pasadena, a nice community about 12 miles from campus right off the 110 freeway.
I’m not a USC student but from looking at the L.A Times Homicide report for that area, it seems true that on campus is much safer than off and certain points seem worse than others.
L.A Times Homicide report for that area.
http://projects.latimes.com/homicide/search/?lat=34.030912&lng=-118.298108&d=2&g=Geocoder.ca&address=2700+Raymond+Ave%2C+Los+Angeles%2C+CA+90007%2C+USA
Im personally surprised that USC posted this on its homepage, given its blatant effort to hide the multiple rapes that have occurred near campus, but then again has sent out an e-mail to our whole school about the clearly senile African American male walking through a crowd with an erect penis.
He was hispanic. Do you have any data regarding the multiple rapes?
regarding rapes,  just heard that a usc student, recently left the library, went to cross the street, was thrown into a white van, brutally beaten , raped multiple times, then thrown out to die alone on a street.. thank God she lived, tell the truth USC. about all the rapes.
usc enough.!  everything needs to be on trojan alert!
george washington university has a crime alert everything, all day, is on, ie: students purse stolen at this location, by a man wearing this .. fitting this description at this time.. let these kids know what is going on . they deserve to be warned and to be safe. their parents deserve their children that they love, to be safe. this is another sad day. God bless the family .
we do get these crime alert weekly. we do receive robberies and rape crime alerts
So you “heard” about this rape? The USC Department of Public Safety (campus police) DOES have a crime alert system in place, exactly like the GWU one you described. Did you know this? I regularly receive these alerts in my inbox. 
This crime is horrible but ignorant, misinformed ranting like yours isn’t helping anyone.
As a new international student who just accepted the offer from USC. I felt so bad! I am not sure about my decision any more! Please, please let us know more about the safety issues of USC.
This was a random act of violence that could have happened anywhere. This is NOT a common occurrence or something anyone expected to happen. It was a senseless act of violence, but it does not reflect the overall safety of the campus or the neighborhood surrounding USC. I have lived West of campus for 2 years, and I have felt perfectly safe the entire time–I have never encountered any real problems and I have never had my physical safety threatened. Don’t base your decision to come/not come here on this one incident.
just because you were unharmed doesn’t mean it IS safe. while not every USC student gets robbed, everyone does have a chance of getting robbed around USC. please use extra precaution. take campus cruiser/tram after 6pm. do not wander around after 10pm at night and live north of campus.
And just because two students were shot in one isolated incident doesn’t mean the entire community is UNSAFE.
While some students are robbed around USC, everyone has the chance of getting robbed *anywhere they go*. Violence and crime happen everywhere. The area around USC is not special in some way.
Sure, take Campus Cruiser or the tram if you want. Or just ride your bike. Or commute to campus. Or walk with friends. Or just pay attention and be vigilant, as you would walking alone anywhere…
really, you think USC surrounding area is safe? I think statistics, law enforcements and the school would disagree with you. Crime is higher in USC compared with UCLA, Cal, Stanford, etc. that is a fact.
I can walk around westwood alone at night no problem.
Heyhey, if you have been in usc long enough( like one semester), you will know everyone expects such things to happen.
This is the most important advice – Steer clear of the surrounding neighborhoods. It’s not safe.
I used to work at USC and I have to add that the area is not really safe. I used to work with international students in particular, and they were the most vulnerable. Clearly, the university needs to provide affordable, safe housing for its international grad students. Unfortunately, acts of violence are anything but uncommon in the area.
Let’s face it, one of the reason that usc has so many international students is making more money. Providing affordable anything isn’t making any sense
that is very true. coming from hong kong where guns are banned and violent crimes are low, i never understood how dangerous the US can be until i lived here. prior my arrival to LA, i kept hearing/reading that “usc area is really ghetto” but i didn’t understand exactly what that meant. even when i lived in dorms my first year, i didn’t realise how DANGEROUS the surrounding area was. i thought ghetto = ugly looking and not pretty suburban but i didn’t think about the crimes committed…the crime alerts definitely helped me grasp that.
Sarah. Since you are an international student you need to know that if you come to USC you will be living in a very large city that is full of all kinds of people and tons of crime.  Dont come here to California and flaunt your wealth. In other words dont bring expensive jewelry- students dont wear it. Dont let your parents  buy you a brand new fancy car either.  A fancy car will just make you a target to robbers and also people who are jealous.  Try to blend in. Most students can’t afford new cars let alone a new imported one.   If you do need a car buy an affordable American made car that wont attract attention.  Like a Ford or a Chevy, a Jeep.  You may not like them but they will be good enough for the next 4 years while you are in college. Also dont get a red car either. Another scream for attention.  Read what all the other comments on this bblog  say about where to live. Pay attention to  the USC safety recomendations. If your parents can afford to pay for your USC tuition then they should be able to afford  housing on the safer sides of off campus housing.  Live on campus as long as you are able. Carry Mace.  You might even want to consider taking self defense classes  before you arrive.
Sarah, I would suggest you find another school. This type situation is challenging for American students, but much worse for International students who do not really grasp American culture from a lifetime of living it. There are about 3000 institutions of higher learning in the USA, many of which offer as superior an education as USC. Unless you are a graduate student coming to USC to work specifically with a famous professor, I think you could do just as well going to a school like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Rice University, The University of Virginia, or Emory. It is just not worth risking your life to attend USC when the surrounding neighborhood is so unpredictable. If you want to get a good job after college, you need to be alive to find one! Please do not kill your parents, friends, and siblings with worry about your well-being in South L.A… Find another school where the crime rate is lower, where you can be happy and successful. Good luck.
well, it just so happens that USC does have the HIGHEST percentage of international students out of all the US universities.
although i have to say, as an international student, i do regret picking USC due to campus safety and lack of things to do around campus. if you got accepted into a better university, do not hesitate to go there. even UCLA, where it is comparable, is a better option because of its surrounding area.
but USC was my top choice in the US so i didn’t really have a choice. hah! but i was stuck in USC without a car for 4 years and it was rather miserable. all i did were house parties which gets boring…and it was a hassle to have someone drive me around.
Such a tragedy! People need also aware that don’t buy/drive around in a luxury car in such neighborhood during nights, don’t make yourself a target! Thugs are less likely to car jack a used Toyota…
RIP. What a tragic loss.
Students, please move to and live in safe neighborhoods!! Students should be told during orientation what are the less safe areas and not to live there.
Wow. F*** all of you.
I really hope the investigation reveals that the shooter was a fellow USC student, just so all of you can choke on your racist, privileged bullsh*t.
Are you kidding me – really, you’re either a fool or a race-baiting scum. Who said anything about race? And yeah, it’s a fellow USC student that pulled the trigger. Look around South Central and tell me who’s got the guns.
You go choke on your own vomit.
How is your statement NOT racist?
Tell me, how do you determine the difference between a USC student and a non-student? I am sure it has *nothing* to do with assuming that anyone white is a student and anyone Black or Latino is a “dangerous thug from the neighborhood.”
Tell me, why do you think South Central is “so unsafe,” even though crime statistics show it to be on par with the rest of the city, and with regard to some types of crime even safer? I am sure it has *nothing* to do with the fact that the neighborhood is predominantly Latino, Black, and Asian families.
Tell me, why is is so implausible that a fellow student may have pulled the trigger? Plenty of violent crimes are perpetrated *by* USC students *against* USC students. Physical assaults and rapes are regular occurrences on any college campus–USC is no exception. And most of those are perpetrated by fellow students.
I look around South Central and see mostly working class families, plenty of young kids going to local elementary and middle schools, and older residents who have lived here for decades.
Tell me, what do YOU see when you look around South Central?
I see lots of dead people. South Central is one of the most violent areas in the country, never mind California. 
If you want to be in denial, go ahead. Venture out at night west of Vermont unarmed and see if you make it back safe after an hour. And make sure you ask for the perpetrator who just robbed you his USC student ID.
I would LOVE to see solid statistics to back up ANYTHING you are saying. I live west of campus (and more than a mile SOUTH of the shooting–*gasp*) and I have had zero problems in the 4 years I have been here.
You are a racist asshat with nothing to back up your claims. Take your prejudiced and privileged bullish*t and get out.
http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/violent-crime/neighborhood/list/
here’s the stats.
“are you kidding me” is full of crap. While the facts are not yet out, have you even read a DPS alert/resolution? How many times is it a USC student? Answer from those alerts: about 1 in 50. Those area students are sometimes the perps, so do us all a favor and save your racism b.s. for others as delusional as you are.
racism aside, statistics do support the fact that most of the violent crimes around south central are in committed by blacks and hispanics. that is precisely why cops and TSA does racial profiling.
That is why Zimmerman went berserk and allegedly committed manslaughter as a neighborhood watchman.  The blacks need to improve their image because the black community is getting a bad rap from their own rotten apples…and please don’t pass blame on others.
Of course traditional college crimes occur at USC by USC students — no one is suggesting that they don’t. Petty theft, sexual assault, etc. When these things happen, no one assumes it’s a non-USC student who committed them. When a shooting occurs at 1am in an area mostly populated by non-USC students? Yeah, I’m going to assume it’s a non-student.
When we (students) receive Crime Alerts that describe armed robberies, shootings, etc. they are not committed by students. In fact, if you were to receive these Crime Alerts, I think you would see that the “SUSPECT DESCRIPTION”s are fairly standard. I am not racist, but I am observational and guess what — of the hundred or so Crime Alerts I’ve received during my time at USC, 99% of the Suspects have been black or latino males. I am someone with many black and latino friends, but facts are facts. I will not be surprised when this murderer is revealed to be black or hispanic. 
If you really thought about what YOU typed, you’d realize that this is not necessarily a racist assumption. Like you said, this “neighborhood is predominantly Latino, Black, and Asian families” — then obviously people who commit crimes are predominantly latino, black and Asian.
This is incredibly tragic. I wish you could recognize the tragedy rather than attacking USC.
DPS doesn’t send out crime alerts for student on student crimes…
do you NOT receive weekly crime alerts from DPS? maybe you should subscribe to it. south central is NOT the same as most areas of the country. and no, south central is not the ONLY unsafe part of los angeles. you are right, the rest of los angeles IS unsafe. including koreatown, vernon, huntington park, etc.
Are you retarded?
Are you kidding me – The mainstream media won’t say the race of the shooter, but everybody knows it’s black. Where’s Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson when you need justice?
When they catch him I hope they send him over to China. They’ll know how to deal with him.
Too many graduate and international students live west of campus because they are not familiar with the area and are in need of affordable housing. When is USC going to step it up and let these students know that the area west of Vermont is not safe? When are landlords north of campus going to stop overcharging for apartments?
The school should reinstate the tram line west of campus. 
This is something that could have  been prevented. This area has never been safe. Students, please don’t risk your life for the sake of cheap rent! Commute by bus or train from nearby safe neighborhoods if you can’t afford north campus housing.
Students, please, please, please do not venture into the jungle in the middle of the night! Use common sense. You are living in a war zone with a bunch of thugs!
You dont live west of Vermont, south of campus or north of Adams.  If you go beyond that, if you are “off the island” and it becomes much less safe.  Students should be told this during orientation.  USC in generally is safe, but at night, things change.  A lot of random locals come by campus, some are up to “no good.”  USC students are like an ATM for criminals.
Keyshawn. You have given everyone  some very good concrete  information. You need to be at orientation talking to students and parents about  this- Seriously!
What a senseless and tragic loss.  New international students might not be aware of how dangerous the community is, especially after dark.  Hopefully someone tells them the truth during orientation and not sugar-coat how “safe” USC is. The campus itself might be relatively safe, but South Central???
