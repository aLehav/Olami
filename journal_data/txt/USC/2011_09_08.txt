Ten years ago Sunday, Americans witnessed a moment that defined a decade.
On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, students watched as news networks showed footage of hijacked planes crashing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon again and again. For students, both those at USC in 2001 and current USC students, who were in elementary or middle school at the time, the event was monumental.
“It’s one of those incidents where everyone will remember where they were and what they were doing,” Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said.
That’s undoubtedly true for both generations of students.
“I remember exactly,” said Jennifer Medina, the city editor of the Daily Trojan in fall 2001, who was on the phone with a friend in Washington, D.C., when the Pentagon was hit. “I hadn’t thought of it for a while, but I’ve never forgotten.”
Neither group of students is ever likely to forget, but the reverberations of 9/11 have been felt differently by both generations.
Medina remembers a sudden change.
“We were far away enough that it wasn’t like everybody on campus knew someone who died, but I think there was a widespread recognition that our lives had changed, our futures had changed,” she said. “A lot of people shifted thinking about careers, thinking about what they wanted. I think there was a sense of invulnerability before.”
“We really did have a sense that this was a new normal.”
The college students of 2001 were unfamiliar with the concept of terrorism, convinced of America’s invincibility and unprepared for an attack by anyone, let alone a stateless terror network. When disaster struck, they wanted to know more.
“Students where asking why,” said Steve Lamy, vice dean for academic programs for USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences and a professor of international relations. “University students are different from the general population. … They want to understand.”
Led by the Office of Religious Life, school administrators held a multi-faith service in Bovard Auditorium to promote understanding — specifically religious tolerance — and later held a teach-in to try to explain the new phase the country had entered. Medina said she had never seen Bovard more tightly packed with students than it was for that service.
Initially there was also an uptick in student interest in Middle Eastern studies. More students wanted to learn Arabic, and there was a bump in enrollment in international relations classes. There was even a spike in interest in ROTC, as students looked to help their country.
For those USC students, it was a new normal. For this generation of Trojans, it is just normal.
“Today they know the word terrorism,” Medina said. “Everything up until [9/11] had felt far away.”
Inevitably, some current USC students had family and friends directly affected by the attacks. But for those who didn’t, the event is almost, as Lamy put it, “ephemeral.”
“I feel like I should be dramatically affected,” said Paige Connell, a junior majoring in biology. “But I was 10. I lived in Washington. I didn’t know anybody. … I care, I just don’t relate.”
That sentiment is not uncommon. Students feel distanced; they were too young to know what was going on.
“They know about it, but I’m not sure they define themselves as the 9/11 generation,” Lamy said.
And on the surface, it seems the direct effects of 9/11 have passed. Interests have shifted away from the Middle East and toward China. Students care more about fixing the economy. Religious tolerance is expected, not taught. The idea of a war against a group of people rather than a country is no longer one that needs explaining.
But that, some say, is what makes today’s students the 9/11 generation; these ideas are embedded in the way students think about the world and manifest in students’ increased concern with world affairs or the growing interest in spirituality.
“For myself, it has opened up the conversation that there are different belief systems,” said Jennifer Gray, a senior majoring in economics and accounting.
Other students recognize that even if they weren’t directly affected, the events of 9/11 shaped the world they grew up in.
“I feel like we live in a totally different world,” said Greg Karber, a second-year graduate student studying screenwriting. “There’s a greater preoccupation with security. People are scared.”
The immediate interest in the Middle East and in learning about terrorism might have faded, but the effects of 9/11 can still be spotted in the attitudes and outlooks of college students.
“They also call your generation the Harry Potter generation,” said Varun Soni, USC’s Dean of Religious Life. “You’re very invested in ideas of good and evil. I think that’s why college students more than any other population were so boisterously celebrating the death of Bin Laden — because it was the end of a long journey that started on 9/11 for those students.”

After a disappointing 10th-place finish at the Pac-10 championships last season, the USC women’s cross-country team looks to bounce back in 2011.
The UC Irvine Invitational in Irvine, Calif., which begins Saturday, will provide the Women of Troy an early season test, especially after the loss of recent graduates Christine Cortez and Zsofia Erdelyi.
“[Erdelyi] was very special, an All-American, and she holds many records for the university,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “She’s definitely the best distance runner we’ve ever had. And Christine’s determination and discipline rubbed off on everyone else on the team. We’re basically starting from scratch now.”
Junior Shelby Buckley and freshman Erica Capellino are expected to help keep USC afloat.
Buckley, a transfer from UCLA, was forced to sit out the 2010 season but posted excellent times while running unattached in three races last year. Capellino also took fifth place at the Iolani Cross Country Invitational for Palos Verdes High School at the CIF State Championships in 2010 with a time of 18:04.
With the team comprised mostly of walk-ons and new members, the rest of the spots on the team have yet to be decided. USC boasts five other talented walk-on freshmen in addition to Capellino. All but Capellino will race this weekend in Irvine.
Capellino is holding off on her season debut until next week’s race at San Diego State.
“We have six fabulous freshmen this season, and we’re really excited about that group and their prospects for the future,” Walsh said. “They’ve had a good solid summer of training and should be ready for this season’s races. The third to seventh ranked spots are up for grabs. There are so many people with similar stats.”
Much like last year, USC’s hopes for a strong season lie in whether the runners can stay healthy. Several athletes have been battling injuries, which might have impacted their summer training. Senior Leah Gaeta will redshirt this season.
A competitive atmosphere with  many underclassmen will allow runners to quickly distinguish themselves, but Walsh knows 2011 will be a building year for USC.
“We’re so young, and sometimes freshmen don’t always run to their best ability right away,” Walsh said. “Hopefully they’ll be able to race as fast as they’re training.”
USC faces steep competition with this year’s Pac-12 lineup, as annual powerhouses Oregon and Stanford boast rosters full of impressive contenders. USC’s lack of cross-country scholarships hinders its ability to actively recruit runners, but this is not an insurmountable challenge, according to Walsh, who remains optimistic about the Women of Troy’s chances of placing higher than last year’s disappointing finish at the Pac-10 championships.
The cross-country season begins in Irvine this weekend and continues through four more California cities before the Pac-12 championships in Tempe, Ariz., on Oct. 29.
“This season will definitely be a growing process,” Walsh said.

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is back in familiar waters.
One week removed from a 26-4 season opening win over Fresno Pacific in the UCI Invitational, the Trojans (1-0) face off against No. 17 Cal Baptist on Saturday in their home opener at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Offensive force · Two-time All-American senior driver Peter Kurzeka ranked second on the Trojans with 41 goals last season. - Daily Trojan file photo
If the Trojans’ recent performance serves as an indication, they have plenty of reasons to be optimistic.
“Cal Baptist will be a good test,” senior driver Peter Kurzeka said. “We are prepared and more than ready to play this team. It will be a good start to a hopefully undefeated season at home.”
Despite an 11-7 win over the Lancers last season, the Trojans, know they cannot overlook their opponent this time around.
“We won last year fairly convincingly, but that being said, Cal Baptist is a young squad and still developing, so who knows what it has in store for us,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said.
Though the Trojans coasted to an easy victory a week ago in their opening weekend slate, which included scrimmages against Long Beach State, Stanford and UC Irvine, they insist week one provided plenty of lessons.
“We learned [in the last game] that we need to play unselfish water polo and take what the other team gives us,” Kurzeka said. “We can’t be forcing things. We have enough talent that anyone can be scoring and we don’t need to worry about anyone in particular doing that. We just need to play as a team and work hard for each other.”
Senior captains Kurzeka and goalie Joel Dennerley, in addition to senior two-meter Matt Burton, will be relied upon in the Trojans’ season opener and over the course of the season.
Every year the senior trio has suited up for USC, they have captured an NCAA championship but they understand it will take much more this season.
“I feel confident but at the same time there is an external force that it is my last year, and there is nothing that I want more than to go out on top,” Kurzeka said. “We have that motivation every day and we’re getting in the pool knowing that it’s our last shot at it, and a shot at history as well.”
With the pressure to improve and aim for a fourth consecutive national title also comes some fun. Current players will face off against USC water polo graduates in a friendly competition in the annual water polo alumni game. Immediately following the action against Cal Baptist.
“They are very talented alumni, and some are former Olympians,” Dennerley said. “It’s always good to catch up to those former teammates.”

The USC women’s soccer team is back on track, and that track leads to familiar turf this weekend.
The Women of Troy (3-3), who hold a three-game win streak, return to McAlister Field to take on No. 4 Oklahoma State and unranked Texas at the Trojan Invitational.

“We’re hopeful that coming home is going to bode really well for us,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “We’re facing some tough programs, but we expect to defend our home.”
Senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge carries USC into this weekend’s marquee matchups after a scorching road trip. Kerridge, who was named a member of the Team of the Week by Soccer America last week, leads the Women of Troy in goals and assists and is third in minutes played.
“She’s been a big help,” senior midfielder/defender Ashli Sandoval said. “She plays real simple ball. She’s been able to find whoever is open seemingly every time. She has the vision to see what’s needed, and she definitely deserves all of the honors she gets.”
Khosroshahin expressed similar sentiments.
“Brittany has really added stability and consistency to this team,” Khosroshahin said. “I think any time a player is able to be consistent and give that type of performance, it gives the team a lot of confidence. Hopefully it’s the type of thing that gets contagious.”
Oklahoma State (7-0) will certainly present a challenge for Kerridge and company, as the Cowgirls have outscored their opponents 19-1 thanks to stellar play from goalkeepers Rosa Medina and Adrianna Franch.
The Women of Troy, however, aren’t letting the numbers faze them.
“I don’t even know how many of our players know they’re ranked that high,” Sandoval said. “We’ve watched them over the last few games. We know they play simple. We know how they play, and that feeds into how we play.”
“If we can eliminate some of the mental mistakes we made early on in the season and continue to improve, it doesn’t matter who we line up against,” Khosroshahin said. “As long as we do what we’re capable of doing, it shouldn’t matter.”
As has been a constant theme throughout the season thus far, the Women of Troy are focusing more on self-improvement than worrying about how good or bad their opponents may be.
“I still think we have a ways to go,” Sandoval said. “We have to stay on our toes. A lapse could lead back to a losing streak, and none of us want that.”
Khosroshahin believes the struggles, are for the most part, in the past.
“There’s been a sense of urgency from [the team],” Khosroshahin said. “They realized they need to pick things up quicker and they’ve been doing just that. They realized they’re representing the Trojan family. We take pride in being great, and I think the rough start made that click with the girls.”
USC takes on Oklahoma State on Friday at 3:30 p.m. and squares off against Texas on Sunday at 12:30 p.m.

In the last three years, Utah has four more wins than USC. The Utes have won at least 10 games a season for the past three years, including an undefeated season in 2008. From 2003-2009, they won seven straight bowl games. They have played in a BCS bowl game just as recently as USC has.
Familiar face · Senior linebacker Chris Galippo and the rest of the defense will see a more conventional attack from the Utah offense on Saturday, who is directed by former USC offensive coordinator Norm Chow. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Needless to say, the Trojans are not taking Utah lightly.
“You don’t have a staff like they do with so many 10-win seasons and be intimidated” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “There’s gonna be no intimidation factor. And anytime that you play like we did last week and let a team hang around the way we did, that doesn’t intimidate people.”
The most noticeable member of that Utah coaching staff is offensive coordinator Norm Chow.
Chow served as the Trojans’ offensive coordinator from 2001-2004. He bolted for the NFL in 2005, but he returned to the college ranks in 2008 as the offensive coordinator of UCLA.
Chow is known as a coordinator who runs a West Coast offense, a sharp contrast to the spread attack that Minnesota threw at the Trojans last week.
“Obviously they are a lot more similar to our offense than Minnesota was, a lot more conventional,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “A lot of play action, throwing the ball downfield. Zone runs — stuff like that. Their quarterback is not a runner but he’s still mobile. They have two good backs, a lot of fast receivers, a good O-line. So we have our work cut out for us.”
But Kiffin admitted that it’s easier to game plan for Chow’s pro-style than Minnesota’s spread.
“The preparation for our defense is a lot easier,” Kiffin said. “Doesn’t mean we’re gonna be successful, but it’s just easier because we know it better and we’re used to playing against it. But then again they’ve had all offseason to practice different stuff they might not have necessarily shown in their first game.”
According to junior quarterback Matt Barkley, however, the Utah defense isn’t quite as conventional as its offense.
“They’re a fast team who flies around and they’ll bring a lot of pressure,” Barkley said. “Their head coach [Kyle Whittingham] is a defensive coach who likes to get after it. So we’re gonna have to be on top of our game with our protection and our routes and getting the ball out quickly.”
Removed from all the strategy and game planning is the significance of the game itself. It’s the first in Pac-12 history, yes, but Kiffin also saw a different motivator.
“From the way people talk about the game it’s a really big game for them,” Kiffin said. “All the smaller schools are rooting for them, now they get a chance to come into a major conference and show themselves every week. I’m sure its major motivation for them.”
Utah is a newcomer to the Pac-12, and to a BCS automatically qualifying conference, having previously played in the Mountain West.
“Yeah it’s the first Pac-12 game,” Barkley said. “It doesn’t really mean anything to us though, we’re just preparing like it’s any other game.”
—
It was Barkley’s 21st birthday Thursday, and the team sang “Happy Birthday” to him at the end of practice. The quarterback said he had no big party plans.
“Dinner with the family,” Barkley said. “We’ve always had a tradition of birthday dinners. Whether it’s a big 21st birthday or a lame old 19th birthday, we do all of them. So they’ll come up and I’ll have a meal with them. But no big plans … probably just watch game film.”

The No. 9 USC women’s volleyball team is just glad to be back.
Talent · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter leads the Women of Troy with 112 kills and 128.5 points through seven games this season. - Daily Trojan file photo
After seven games away from the friendly confines of Galen Center to start the season, the Women of Troy (5-2), who opened the season with road trips to University Park, Penn. and south Florida, return to their home court for their home opener Friday against No. 8 UCLA.
It won’t be easy.
Though riding a four-game winning streak, including four straight sweeps, USC faces a UCLA team that has won six of its first seven games.
“It was a rough road trip, but I think it was really good for the younger girls to gain experience,” senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter said. “Still, we’re glad we’re back at home.”
Jupiter, who leads the team in kills and points, will be counted upon for her experience, as the Women of Troy look to contend with UCLA’s outside hitter Rachel Kidder, who remains among the best in the Pac-12.
This week Kidder was nominated for the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week, and as with Jupiter, Kidder leads the team in kills and points. She not only provides an offensive presence but makes her mark on defense, ranking second on the team in digs.
Though Kidder might rank as the Bruins’ top talent, they also boast a three-headed monster on the outside with Tabi Love and Kelly Reeves, who rank second and third, respectively on the team in kills.
After its last match, a five-set thriller, which resulted in a loss to Pepperdine, UCLA is looking to bounce back, adding more fuel to an already-heated rivalry.
The Women of Troy are hoping to combat a motivated Bruins squad by looking to get some more production from the rest of their roster beyond Jupiter — something USC coach Mick Haley has preached all season.
Junior outside hitter/opposite Katie Fuller, who finished with seven kills Tuesday against Cal State Northridge, could provide a lift.
“I’m really excited … especially for the younger girls coming home for this,” Jupiter said when asked about the significance of the rivalry. “It’s a great experience with a packed crowd, and everything is just so intense.”
Freshman setter/opposite Emily Young is also making strides on the left side and has impressed Haley.
“In the middle we’re going to go with [senior middle blocker Lauren] Williams and [freshman middle blocker] Hannah Schraer, who we need to step up for us, especially with [sophomore middle blocker] Alexis Olgard not healthy,” Haley said.
The first 5,000 fans in attendance for the match will receive a free “Spike The Bruins” T-shirt as USC looks to set a new women’s volleyball attendance record.

Matt Barkley, Robert Woods.
By now, you’ve heard those names plenty of times, after both broke USC single-game records against Minnesota last weekend in its season home opener.
Sophomore wide receiver Woods recorded 17 receptions for 177 yards and three touchdowns and the junior signal caller, Barkley, completed 34-of-45 passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns. Basically, the two were responsible for 18 of USC’s 19 points.
Other than those two, I, along with USC coach Lane Kiffin might agree that nobody else on offense really showed up. When the Minnesota defense took away Woods, the USC offense stalled and was shut out in the second half.
Why?
The Trojans’ offense did not have a running game.
Kiffin decided to put the ball through the air, calling a pass play 45 times out of USC’s 73 total offensive plays, which is more than 60 percent.
What about that deep backfield raved about in fall camp? Out of junior Curtis McNeal, sophomore Dillon Baxter, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan and freshman Amir Carlisle, only Morgan and McNeal saw significant playing time. Baxter had one reception for three yards and Carlisle didn’t even sniff the playing field.
But after the game, he mentioned playing this style of ball wasn’t to his liking.
“It’s not really fun to play the game that way so spread out and balls going all over the place,” Kiffin said after the win against Minnesota. “It just gets you out of rhythm. It’s not the normal ’SC rhythm of running the ball and play-action.”
With the pending return of senior running back Marc Tyler on Saturday, all that could change fast.
Remember those days with Lendale White and Reggie Bush? They weren’t nicknamed “Thunder and Lightning” or “Smash and Dash” for no reason.
With those two in the backfield, it opened up the play-action pass to guys like Mike Williams, Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith.
Fast-forward to 2011 and you could see similar results. Give Tyler carries to soften up the front-seven, get Baxter, Morgan or McNeal out in space to let him operate a la Reggie Bush and watch that Barkley/Woods combination go to work.
Though Morgan is listed as the starter, if I were Kiffin, I would give Tyler the featured role. Heck, I’d even start him.
Last year in the eight games Tyler started, he totaled 134 rushes for 625 yards and seven rushing touchdowns. That’s 4.7 yards per carry and 78 yards per game for a USC offense that averaged 26 points per game.
Though just looking at one game, the USC offense clearly wasn’t the same on Saturday. Other than the bad snap by junior center Khaled Holmes, The Trojans totaled just 99 yards on the ground, averaged 3.9 yards per carry and didn’t record a rushing touchdown.
Let’s face it: Morgan probably won’t be able to handle 18-20 carries game in and game out. Running hard through the tackles isn’t going to make up for a lack of size, especially in short-yardage situations.
But that’s another asset Tyler brings to the table.
What clearly was missing Saturday was someone who the Trojans could turn to in third-and-short situations. USC could have used Tyler in situations where it needed three yards or less to convert a first down.
On Saturday, I remember seeing all of McNeal — yes, that’s all 5-foot-7, 180 pounds of him — line up in the backfield on third-and-two at the Minnesota 44-yard line. He was dropped behind the line for a loss of two yards.
In the third quarter with USC at the Minnesota 20-yard line in a fourth-and-one situation, Kiffin elected to go for the first down rather than kick a field goal.
The result? Morgan was stopped at the line and USC turned the ball over on downs.
Two chances to get first downs, two missed opportunities to keep the drive alive and possibly score more points.
With Tyler last season, the Trojans were 10-of-15 on short-yardage situations on third down and three yards or less. In other words, they converted 67 percent of those plays into first downs.
Though it’s easy to second-guess, Tyler’s return is exactly what this USC offense and team needs; they need somebody to run the ball down the teeth of the defense and alleviate some pressure off Barkley’s arm and Woods’ shoulders.
By now we’ve heard all the speculation about Tyler and his status.
With his return, it should give USC a much-needed boost in the backfield.

The last time USC faced Utah, the Trojans were upset by the Utes 10-6 in the Las Vegas Bowl — the lowest scoring game in the bowl’s history.
That was 10 years ago. Much has changed.
He’s back · USC coach Lane Kiffin reinstated senior running back Marc Tyler this week after serving a one-game suspension. Though redshirt freshman running back D.J. Morgan is listed as the starter, Tyler could see a prominent role after USC struggled to run the ball last weekend. - Daily Trojan file photo
Over the past decade, Utah (1-0), then a .500 team from the Mountain West Conference, has finished with two undefeated seasons, two BCS bowl victories and five seasons with at least 10 wins.
The Utes will square off against USC (1-0) on Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as a conference foe, marking the first-ever Pac-12 game.
“There’ll be a lot of energy around it,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I’m sure it’s a huge game for them, coming down to the Coliseum — regardless of it being the conference opener. And for us, first place in our division is on the line.”
Utah, along with Colorado, officially joined the Pac-12 on July 1, marking the first time the conference had expanded since 1978 when it added Arizona and Arizona State.
If recent history is any indication, the Utes won’t need much time to adjust to the new setting. Over the last three seasons, they have won a total of 33 games. Under coach Kyle Whittingham, who took over for Urban Meyer following the 2004 season, they have compiled an overall mark of 57-20. Not to mention, since 2003, the program is 7-3 against the Pac-10.
“This is a very good team; a team that over the last 10 years has been as good as anybody in the country,” Kiffin said. “They’re not going to be intimidated by coming to ’SC or the Coliseum, so we’re going to have our hands full.”
Last week Utah faced Football Championship Subdivision Montana State and finished with just 292 yards of total offense and three touchdowns en route to a 27-10, a score closer than most anticipated.
Similarly, USC experienced a few problems offensively as well in its opener against Minnesota, as it was outscored by Minnesota 14-0 in the second half.
“The inexperience showed up,” Kiffin said of the team’s second-half struggles. For whatever reason, in the first half, the inexperience didn’t show up as much.”
The tandem of junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods largely concealed that inexperience, especially in the first half, combining for 17 receptions, 177 yards and three touchdowns. Woods, as a result, eclipsed the school single-game mark for receptions.
“It’s a combination of the work we put in and the chemistry we have,” Barkley said when asked about his connection with Woods. “He’s a really consistent guy that I trust. If it’s in his vicinity, he goes up and gets it.”
 
Despite the Trojans’ success through the air against Minnesota, Kiffin might opt to employ a more balanced attack against the Utes after senior tailback Marc Tyler was reinstated Tuesday following a one-game suspension.
“He’s practiced really hard, so we’ll mix him in there some most likely, and see what happens there in the game,” Kiffin said.
With Tyler in the fold, USC, which ran the ball less than 40 percent of the time against Minnesota, now boasts a crowded backfield with sophomore Dillon Baxter, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan and junior Curtis McNeal all vying for playing time.
The Utes, however, feature one of the nation’s best defensive lines, as it allowed just 111.6 rushing yards per game last season — good for 11th nationally. Against Montana State, it allowed just 75.
“Since we’ve been back this time, I would say this is the best front four we’ve seen and had to face,” Kiffin said. “The front seven in general is really, really good and dominant at times.”
The Trojans’ defense, although not boasting similar 2010 numbers, did look much improved a week ago, allowing just 302 yards of total offense against the Gophers — the lowest in its last 22 games.
“We started pretty well,” senior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “We answered a lot of questions. There are a lot of things you don’t find out until game day. We just need to continue to work, be stingy and make plays.”
Facing the Utes’ offense will be familiar, at least to some degree, as Utah hired celebrated offensive coordinator Norm Chow to install his West Coast offense this offseason. Chow served as USC’s coordinator from 2001-2004 and as UCLA’s from 2008-2010, running a scheme similar to the Trojans’ own.
“It’s nice,” Galippo said of facing a familiar offense. “We can come out here and practice and go against our offense and still get looks that will prepare us for Saturday.”
Kickoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m., and the game will be televised on Versus.

Poet Maya Angelou sat alone on the stage of Bovard Auditorium — no moderator necessary.
Inspired by the packed house of students, staff, faculty and community members Wednesday night, Angelou crafted a message of respect and encouragement for USC.
Powerful words · Poet Maya Angelou visited Bovard Auditorium on Wednesday night, offering the audience an inspirational reading and leaving Trojans with an unforgettable, uplifting experience. - Jennifer Schultz | Daily Trojan
 
“By looking at you, I see a possibility of light,” Angelou said.
In her hour-long appearance, the celebrated poet, author of I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings and civil rights activist took on a conversational tone, mainly addressing the students in the audience, many of whom lined up as early as 2 p.m. to hear Angelou speak.
“I just thought it would be an honor to be in Bovard, even 100 feet away from [Angelou],” said Corrine Tom, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering.
Tom was one of the first people in line and won a chance to meet Angelou backstage before the program began.
Once Angelou took the stage, she seemed invigorated by the ovations and applause, tapping her feet and smiling brightly at the crowd. She went on to praise the students in attendance.
Angelou encouraged students to seize their opportunity in school and set a path for generations ahead of them.
“We need you desperately,” she said. “Not enough adults tell you how desperately we need you.”
While preparing for this visit last month, Angelou said she would base her remarks on her “evaluation of the university, what it hopes to achieve and what it is actually achieving.”
“I just really like USC,” Angelou said.
Angelou received an honorary degree from the university in 1989. She said she had a number of friends on the faculty and staff, and described the school as a “rainbow in the clouds.”
In her talk Wednesday, she interwove words of advice with thoughts on race, love and purpose in life for younger generations.
“We are the true wonders of the world. No matter the color of our skin, the people we choose to love or the things we choose to believe in, as members of the human race, we are one,” she said.
Those thoughts connected with a number of poems she recited from memory, including Langston Hughes’ “Harlem Sweeties,” infused with a hint of Angelou sass.
“Glow of the quince / To blush of the rose. / Persimmon bronze / To cinnamon toes. / Blackberry cordial, / Virginia Dare wine — / All those sweet colors / Flavor Harlem of mine!”
Each line flowed naturally from Angelou as if the words were her own.
“Poetry has been ignored quite a long time,” Angelou said. “I’ve been using poetry quite a bit to encourage myself and others to be more than they were yesterday, to be more than you thought you could be.”
She told students to go to their libraries right away and to ask the librarians for help finding overlooked literature.
During a humorous moment in her readings, Angelou selected “The Health-Food Diner,” a poem written after a confrontation with a waitress in a vegetarian restaurant.
“No sprouted wheat and soya shoots / And Brussels in a cake, / Carrot straw and spinach raw, / (Today, I need a steak).”
At the beginning of the program she flaunted her bilingual abilities as well, singing “Malaguena Salerosa,” a love song of Mexican origin.
Juan Espinoza, director of the speakers committee for USC Program Board, began planning Angelou’s visit in June.
“Seeing her here and seeing a living legend is phenomenal,” Espinoza said. “Words really can’t describe what that feels like.”
And though Angelou did not speak for long, her words stuck.
“Somebody was here before you,” Angelou said. “You’re in an institution of higher education — spiritually paid for, psychologically paid for, here you are.”
Angel Haro, an alumnus of the class of 2009, clung to Angelou’s idea that our ancestors and relatives created the path for him and others to attend a school of higher learning.
“It’s the most meaningful event I’ve ever been to,” Haro said. “She taught me that we’ve all been spiritually paid for.”
Asha Anderson, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, heard Angelou speak in Washington, D.C. last summer and again Wednesday night on campus.
“She was inspirational each time. She values everyone’s struggles and everyone’s history,” Anderson said. “She has so much strength.”
The 83-year-old is halfway finished with a new memoir, Mom and Me, discussing the impact the relationship with her mother had and continues to have on her.
“It’s a book about my mother and the effect she had on my spirit, my way of being,” Angelou said.
Angelou’s visit served as an optimistic reminder that the work and time spent at USC is a foundation for the rest of students’ lives. Even when the future seems uncertain, this rainbow in the clouds will continue shining vibrantly.
Beautifully written article!  Good Job!  I felt like I was there and I am 3000 miles away!  She is an inspiration to us all!

From Saw to The Sixth Sense to Piranha 3D, America has slaked its thirst for horror films. Among cranky zombies and evil little ghost girls, another kind of film still carries legitimate creepy factor. It isn’t about supernatural forces, but something far more terrifying: real life. 
The film Contagion comes out this week, wherein Kate Winslet, Marion Cotillard and Matt Damon battle the forces of plague and pestilence. It is the latest in the genre of thriller-horrors.
The thought of humanity’s impending doom disturbs people more than a cursed videotape. Some of our most pressing fears have changed throughout the decades — such as the threat of the Soviet Union — but others, such as natural disasters, have not. Chucky and Pennywise just don’t stack up against Commies, global warming or virus pandemics.
Though the second Red Scare ended in 1957, the Cold War did not end until 1991. As such, Soviet Communists were the terrorists of the day — provokers of fear, rumors and mob mentality. What’s scarier than a commie who might be living next door? A commie who might be running your government. The Manchurian Candidate (1962) uses this fear to create a harpstring-taut tension as a brainwashed American war hero has become an assassin for the Communists. His puppeteer is his Commie mom Angela Lansbury, who has her sights on her husband’s potential presidency.
Since ancient man first realized it’s not a good idea to hang out in a field during a lightning storm, the elements have earned our respect. And when they destroy our cities and decimate our populace, they earn our hysterical terror. The Poseidon Adventure in 1972 is one of the most successful of the era’s disaster flicks. It harkens back to the dread of a sinking ship but with a twist — a tidal wave has flipped over the sinking ship with the passengers still inside. From then on, it’s a pulse-pounding race to the engine room.
Children of the ’90s might remember the horror of the opening scene of Twister, when the father is sucked up from a cellar during a savage tornado. In 1975, people fled the beaches after the release of Jaws, which terrified viewers with a selachian sea demon from some watery hell, complete with his own theme music.
More recently, Hollywood has tackled the planet’s rebellion against our Hummers and soda cans. The grandest and cheesiest example is Roland Emmerich’s entertaining The Day After Tomorrow, where global warming causes a new ice age.
Fear of things we can do is a recent addition to the American film psyche. In addition to destroying the planet, humanity’s proclivity for the frontiers of science has also come under fire. Though technically a sci-fi film, Vincenzo Natali’s 2009 Splice gives viewers a taste of what cloning can cause. That taste is a ferocious hybrid creature that slaughters kitties and seduces its masters. Dolly doesn’t look so cute anymore.
Even scarier than when science goes wrong is when it fails. America has the most advanced medical centers in the world — but what happens if a plague breaks out and we can do nothing to stop it? Most plague films today involve mutant children or zombies, but an unstoppable disease is unsettling in its own right. Contagion hones in on this uneasy potential. It has no zombie outbreaks or alien invasions, just old fashion death and decimation. This fear is very much present in American culture — just how nuts did people go when swine flu broke out?
As time goes on, there appears to be a shift in what scares us. Yesteryear, many real life fear films involved hostile external forces. Today, many of our fears stem from horrors we can unwittingly cause, like global warming. At the same time, we live in an age where we have access to massive quantities of information. PubMed — the free database — alone is enough to turn fatigue and stress into a Lupus self-diagnosis.
As the saying goes, the more you know, the more you have to worry about. Perhaps producers should look more to newspapers than Asian cinema for the next horror hit.

Hollywood loves a good sports underdog, and in Warrior, there are two. Filmmaker Gavin O’Connor, who made the stand-up-and-cheer crowd-pleaser Miracle, has struck gold again, this time by turning the sports genre on its head.
No holds barred: Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgarton) battles emphatically through the mixed-martial arts ranks in a film that embodies quality mainstream filmmaking and serves to amp up the fighting genre. - Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Publicity
Instead of remaking the same conventional sports movie — where the little guy dramatically beats his towering opponent in an upset — O’Connor and co-writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman build Warrior to a gutwrenching, final battle between dual protagonists who are equally deserving of the affection.
The result is a movie more unpredictable and true-to-life than any sports drama since 2008’s Sugar.
The fact that estranged brothers Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) will ultimately come to fight each other is clear from the beginning. But their journeys and the outcome of the final mixed martial arts championship match couldn’t be less calculated.
Thankfully, the film sidesteps the temptation to use MMA as an ornate metaphor for life, whereby Tommy and Brendan physically express their years-old hostilities toward one another. Though the fractured nature of the relationship certainly adds drama to their inevitable showdown, Warrior’s true narrative transformation takes place outside the cage. Little by little, O’Connor and his co-writers peel back the layers of a working-class family’s history in quiet scenes that carry the same vitality as the showier fight segments.
That said, those fight segments are pretty damn special. Unlike countless boxing and wrestling movies, Warrior is not simply one long, soundtrack-dominated montage of knock-outs. Instead, O’Connor implements the MMA sequences selectively and only where they serve the purpose of advancing the plot.
O’Connor’s decision to not overwhelm the audience with one fight scene after another ensures that, when there is a fight scene, it packs a strong punch. Through cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi’s tight handheld shots, which often rival Raging Bull’s in their claustrophobic effect, O’Connor makes sure that the viewer can feel the simultaneous skill and barbarism of every kick, grapple, and throw.
The acting is also integral to the film’s riveting sense of spontaneity. Hardy and Edgerton, both international stars on the rise in Hollywood, make real men out of roles that could have all too easily become caricatures. Hardy plays a scarred war hero and Edgerton a financially troubled teacher who only returns to MMA to fend for his family — not exactly tough guys to root for, but they truly earn the audience’s sympathies through complex characterization.
Crafting realized characters outside the cage was only half the battle for the two leads, who also had to take on exhaustive physical regimens to credibly play MMA competitors. The film’s production notes boast that Hardy and Edgerton did 85 percent of the fighting themselves, and this figure is not hard to believe; not only do both sport incredibly chiseled physiques, they also appear nimble and well-trained, even in close-up shots.
Adding to its pool of riches, Warrior also offers surprisingly adroit social commentary on the nature of sports-celebrity in the era of the viral video. By the power of YouTube, the brothers become overnight sensations — Tommy as a symbol of nationalist pride and Brendan as the badass teacher who weathers a brutal parking lot match. The championship might mean a lot to the two on a personal level, but in the Internet age, it means even more to their instantaneously formed followers and the media.
Warrior is unlikely to change anybody’s life, but that’s not the point. It is the definition of quality mainstream filmmaking — broad in its appeal and straightforward in its emotions, but nonetheless human and not beholden to every cliché in the book.
If there is any justice in this year’s awards season, the Academy will atone for its nomination of the decade’s most artificial sports drama, The Blind Side, by recognizing this vastly superior achievement in the genre.

Soon, the anniversary of Sept. 11 will be upon us, and the memories of those who lost their lives on that fateful day will captivate our attention — but for how long? A fleeting moment is all we usually allot for reflection on Sept. 11 despite the existing ramifications of that day in the history of the United States. If anything, it has left this nation in chaos.
The political arena has been so irrevocably altered that many students are daunted at the idea of even bothering to involve themselves with politics much longer.
Americans were united in the months after 9/11, but shortly after business as usual returned. The decision to declare war in Afghanistan and Iraq was not unanimous, causing people to disagree and be vocal about that decision. Since then, the wars have become costly and a lightning rods for discussion revolving around American foreign policy and the government’s role in general.
The war led in part to a return of partisan politics, which has infected almost every aspect of the United States government.
The political factions that arose after 9/11 to originally encourage thought and discussion have become counterproductive to creating any sort of unison among citizens. Most importantly, they have instead created hostility that permeates Congress in nearly every decision made. Outside of Congress, this hostility even travels to the streets among the public.
If anything, the political arena of the United States has become even more divided, not more unified, after Sept. 11. I vividly remember watching the news and hearing news casters say things like, “This is our time to be unified as one nation, under God,” and most of us nodded our heads in agreement. But are we still united?
If we take a microscope to the changing nature of politics since 2001, we will notice that some issues have become prominent: a severe recession, ultra-conservative backlash by factions such as the Tea Party, and, most of all, disunity.
The Republicans and Democrats still do not agree over how to resolve the economic crisis and, as a result, our economy is still suffering while partisanship continues to lead to inaction.
Additionally, the Tea Party used the events of Sept. 11 as an excuse to create an ultra-right winged faction rearing its head against immigrants and minorities. Above all, members are proponents of a strong military presence in America but without cuts in the defense spending.
People told many jokes about the worker at the 7-Eleven and how he or she could potentially be a terrorist. Racial profiling ran amok from government agencies, such as TSA, to just regular people walking on the street giving anxious and fearful looks to Middle Easterners.
It’s easy to say such a catastrophic event spurred conversation and expression of thought between two diametrically opposed sections of the country, claiming that partisanship led to debate and compromise. Most of all, it’s easy to say  we are united. But we shouldn’t allow the desire to be a cohesive country glaze our eyes over in seeing the true realities of Sept. 11.
The scars are obviously prevalent, and it is sound to say that the conversation that stemmed from that day wasn’t necessarily healthy.

Disunity is what in fact we have. in Washington, Republicans are not agreen with pesident Obama proposals.
An the so call  ” Tea Party” that  is a Joke.. Stop the stupid Tea Party. they are only good to spend MY TAX DOLLARs  you  ILITERATE people    .
As a movement, The Tea Party is not a political party nor is looking to form a third political party any time soon. The Tea Party movement, is instead, about reforming all political parties and government so that the core principles of our Founding Fathers become, once again, the foundation upon which America stands     THIS IS WHAT A “TEA PARTY IS SUPPOSED  TO BE.. But is NOT… so GET RID of Them .   Americans need to stay together. or we are going to loose this Country and  we will be begging The Chinese for Rice to eat very soon.
Do you really have to comment if you can’t spell or write a sentence properly?  No one cares about your rant.
Judging by who is in power now I think you need to redefine illiterate you most intolerant person. As a conservative I find that the liberal arm of politics is the most intolerant and racist to those that don’t agree with them.
Please get a new rant…your starting to sound like your president, predictable, inexperienced and un-American.
(I’m waiting for your ad hominem attack now)
I’ll be attending my first Tea Party meeting this coming Monday night.  I’ll be sure to rear my head (and it’s an ugly one)!  I think I have some idea of where your head is.
The Tea Party has nothing to do with 9/11.  Are you insane?
Matt, that’s your response?  Does anyone understand what you are trying to say?  Your remarks are devoid of logic, reason, facts, evidence, examples or anything else substantive.
I thought my point was obvious, but let me elaborate.  The Tea Party and 9.11 have nothing to do with one another.  The Tea Party didn’t even come into existence until a couple years ago.  They also don’t have anything to do with national defense or security, but that’s besides the point. So to say that the Tea Party used 9/11 as an excuse to…. as the author says, is completely ludicrous.  It’s not even a matter of opinion, it’s just a fact!
I am glad this is an opinion piece and not some sort of journalistic reporting endeavor. Even so when an opinion is based on such  factual inaccuracies I can only attribute it to a untra left viewpoint rearing its head. The Tea Party has nothing to do with 9/11 but everything to do with the left leaning taxing distributive policies of Obama’s administration. Taxed Enough Already is where the name comes from. Also while there may have been the occassional incidents of people joking at 7-elevens, as a person with brown skin I can proudly say that this nation was remarkably restrained in it’s reaction after 9/11. I am not sure the general population in other countries would have been this  restrained. I  personally or my family have never experienced any racial profiling. 
Please check your facts Melissa before you opine. It will give credibility to what you say.
The author and editor of this article are idiots. Fact check from time to time. The Tea Party was inspired by September 11?
Don’t insult the 2996 people who died in those attacks like that. It’s inappropriate, demeaning, un-American, and utterly wrong.
True realities. My kinda reality.
Wait what?
“The Tea Party used the events of 9/11 as an excuse to create an ultra-right winged faction rearing its head against immigrants and minorities?   Above all, members are proponents of a strong military presence in America but without cuts in the defense spending.”
Dear Author,
The Tea Party didn’t even exist until 2009!! That is honestly one of the most ridiculously wrong statements I’ve ever seen in the Daily Trojan.  In addition, Tea Party members are not proponents of a “strong military presence in America” (whatever that means)- they focus on fiscal issues and government spending and debt.  Many of them are actually ANTI military spending and adventurism overseas because of its cost.
Does anyone at the Daily Trojan edit the articles written?  Don’t you have editors?  I’m truly embarrassed by some of the work that comes out of this paper.
If you are going to have such terrible writers, at least make them write about parties or frats, not worldly issues where ignorance will rear its ugly head.
Sincerely,
Disappointed reader.
Perfectly said Max,
It’s too bad the DT has stooped this low, they must be desperate for material. This doesn’t even qualify as opinion, it’s just partisan dribble.
But don’t be disappointed, this is what we can and should expect from the DT.

Most of us students were only in the formative pre-adolescent years of our childhood when Al-Qaeda terrorists carried out their horrendous attacks on our nation, but we all remember that day. The phrase “9/11: We Will Never Forget” is permanently etched into many of our memories, guaranteeing we will, in fact, never forget.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
After the attacks, everyone was united in their shock, confusion and grief. There was no Democrat or Republican, only American.
Partisanship did re-emerge as usual. But something else had been set in motion by the attacks that would pervade the American political scene for years to come: the American people’s renewed passion for its country.
Such a political trend among us might at first glance reflect a lack of patriotism, but this passionate disagreement actually suggests the existence of an even stronger kind of patriotism.
America had settled into a comfortable position politically in the years prior to the attacks. People were satisfied with letting their representatives run the government for them. Voter turnout in the 1996 and 2000 elections was at its lowest in years.
When Sept. 11 happened, people were forced to question their sense of security, increasing  political consciousness and active participation in the government by the people.
The political infighting among our representatives has, if anything, intensified, sometimes resulting in congressional deadlock. This is nothing new, but in the years since the worst act of terrorism on American soil, we citizens have become more outspoken in our disagreements as to the best way to run our nation.
This trend applies not just to large populist movements like the Tea Party, but to the student community as well. The mindset following Sept. 11 has manifested itself in our generation, making us the harbingers of a more involved kind of patriotism.
At USC, political engagement and disagreement has increased in the last 10 years. Topics such as the Tea Party are frequently discussed in a variety of courses, and multiple Daily Trojan articles regarding political issues have received attention.
Comments on these articles show that even though readers disagree and sometimes become angry over differing opinions, they nonetheless care enough but to get involved in the discussion and to further the ideas that they are most passionate about.
We have shown our resilience as a nation with the reawakening of a more participatory democracy and involved electorate, which we should continue as we move into our positions as leaders of the future.
We the people do not need to all agree on every issue, or even get through a political debate with a friend without yelling and screaming.
As long as we care enough to disagree and voice our concerns, there is always the chance for progress and improvement. That is the greatest form of patriotism that we could ask for.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays. 
Low voter turnout does not by any means reflect satisfaction with the political/governmental state of affairs. Other factors, all a good deal less-comfortable, produce the same result.
Perhaps first is a lack of choice/information: prospective voters regard (with much reason) all contending candidates as crooks or agents of narrow interests, and their campaign promises as lies and deceptions.
Second is the unlikelihood that one’s own, single vote has any chance of influencing results, especially when so few others are voting for reasons other than (for example) being on the candidate’s payroll in one way or another.
Finally, thanks to the War on Drugs and the minimum wage, a growing portion of the populace CAN’T vote because either they are convicted felons or they are illegal aliens (working illegally for illegal rates of pay).

After watching USC utilize the Matt Barkley-to-Robert Woods connection 17 different times for a total of 177 yards and 3 touchdowns against Minnesota, it is no secret who the Trojans’ quarterback favors most. Although the Utah secondary knows the likely destination of the majority of Barkley’s passes, limiting the output of the Barkley-Woods tandem will arguably be the toughest task that the inexperienced defensive backs of Utah will face this season.
A year ago, Utah was torched for 14 passing touchdowns in it’s final five games. Additionally, the Utes surrendered 225 yards a game through the air in 2010, a total ranked 73rd nationally. To further complicate matters, Utah returns exactly zero starters from this lackluster unit of a year ago.
Cornerbacks Conroy Black and Ryan Lacy will accompany safeties Michael Walker and Keith McGill in the defensive secondary. These four players had a combined total of one start in all of 2010, when Black got the nod against Wyoming.
The secondary did fare well against Football Championship Subdivision Montana State last weekend, yielding just 183 passing while snagging two interceptions. However, there is a big difference between Bobcats quarterback Denarius McGee and Heisman Trophy hopeful Matt Barkley. The Utes must find a way to shore up the defensive backs before Saturday, as USC coach Lane Kiffin elected to throw the ball 45 times against Minnesota in the opener.

Comedy Central has announced it will be using Ozzy Osbourne’s hit song ‘Crazy Train’ as part of the marketing push toward Charlie Sheen’s Roast. The song is in line with the rumors that Charlie Sheen’s character in the popular sitcom Two and a Half Men is expected to be killed by a train in the show’s season premiere.
Both Two and a Half Men and the Roast will premiere on the night of September 19. In an interview with Ad Age, Walter Levitt, Executive VP of Marketing)at Comedy Central, said, “It was one of those moments as a marketer where you just feel like the universe is unfolding as it should and aligning perfectly.” He then added, “The fact that an hour earlier Charlie will be killed by a train is almost too perfect for words.”
The campaign involves the train theme being played across TV, out-of-home, radio, print and social media. In addition, double-decker buses in New York and Los Angeles are being covered to resemble the campaign’s signature ‘Crazy Train,’ and a train track-themed wallscape is being put up on Prince and Lafayette Streets in New York.
On TV, the channel is showing the latest in its series of train-conductor spots with Sheen, and will follow that up with clips from the show once it has been taped Sept. 10.
Roast, since its announcement in July, has become of Comedy Central’s marquee event,s and the channel has left no stone unturned in its efforts to make it a resounding success. The show has roped in Jackass star Steve-O, TMZ’s Harvey Levin and heavyweight champ Mike Tyson to be a part of it, along with Roast favorites Jeffrey Ross and Anthony Jeselnik and Roast Master Seth MacFarlane.
Holland Taylor and Ron Cryer, Sheen’s co-stars from Two and a Half Men, had earlier declined to be a part of the show.

The commercial area underneath Tuscany is undoubtedly one of the most reliable areas for high-quality takeout food around USC, featuring Chipotle, Chik-Fil-A and Quizno’s, to name a few. This semester, the restaurants are joined by a franchise of California Teriyaki Grill, an all-natural Southern California-based chain.
With its new USC location marking the seventh California Teriyaki Grill in Southern California, the restaurant serves up a quick yet delicious variety of teriyaki dishes.
The menu is fairly basic, featuring a choice of a bed of rice, noodles or vegetables, and one of four teriyaki items: chicken, beef, shrimp or vegetables. Side items include gyoza, miso soup, kimchi or egg rolls, bringing together several different Asian specialties to create what Teriyaki Grill calls “California-style” dishes.
The chicken plate ($6.95) arrived in a standard black takeout box, and featured a large pile of pounded-thin chicken breast dressed in a delectably tangy teriyaki sauce on a bed of white rice. On the downside, the dish was accompanied by a lackluster iceberg lettuce salad in a questionably scented lemon vinaigrette.
The California plate was made up of a shrimp skewer, a half-order of chicken and a half-order of beef teriyaki. All three proteins were of good quality and well cooked, but the real standout was the teriyaki sauce itself. CTG prides itself on having a secret recipe passed down from Seattle restaurateur Jun Hong.

The amount and quality of food is certainly a good buy for the price; CTG states all meat and vegetables are supplied fresh on a daily basis, and white-meat chicken is available on request. It’s an all-natural restaurant that advertises its refusal to use additives or oils. Nothing on the menu costs more than $10, and each plate is large and filling.
CTG can be found between Quizno’s and Chipotle at 3742 S. Figueroa, Los Angeles, CA.

Professor of organic chemistry George Olah, Nobel-Laureate and founding director of USC’s Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute, will receive the Széchenyi-nagydíj Prize tonight from Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary.
The award is given to those who have made an outstanding contribution to academic life in Hungary and will be presented by Professor József Pálinkás, president of the Hungarian Academy of Science.
Olah described the Széchenyi Nagydíj as a lifetime achievement award given only in special cases.
“This award is not something I got for work,” Olah said. “This is recognition for my lifetime effort. Since the Communist regime was thrown off, I tried to help the development of Hungarian science and higher education.”
Olah was born in Budapest, Hungary, and attended Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where he first studied and later taught. He fled Hungary with his family and his research group during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, and moved to England, Canada and finally the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen in 1971.
“It’s basically honoring a long-lost son,” said Professor G.K. Surya Prakash, one of Olah’s former graduate students and the current George A. and Judith A. Olah Nobel Laureate Chair in Hydrocarbon Chemistry at USC. “[Hungary’s] trying to recognize its own heroes.”
Despite fleeing Hungary more than 50 years ago, Olah is grateful that his home country is honoring him.
“I am not one for publicity, but I got the phone call inquiring whether I would be willing to accept this and I expressed my gratitude to my native country that they have not forgotten me,” Olah said. “I am an American of Hungarian origins, but I still have a very strong feeling for my native county. When my native country was freed after a very long period of being dominated by the Soviet empire, in my small way I tried to help.”
Olah came to USC in 1977, bringing his knowledge and desire to learn more about chemistry. He also received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
“He is one of the chemists who has ideas first,” said Robert Aniszfeld, one of Olah’s former graduate and postdoctoral students and the current managing director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. “There are types of scientists who collect and analyze data and then one day, something pops. George is the kind of chemist who has an idea of how a reaction should work beforehand.”
Olah has contributed more than 150 patents and 1,500 publications, including 20 books, to the academic community. He has taught more than 250 doctorate students.
“I am very proud of my scientific family,” Olah said. “As a professor, the greatest satisfaction is to see his or her students make progress in their chosen fields.”

As part of an expanded emphasis on peace and conflict studies, students will, for the first time, travel to Belfast, Northern Ireland to study conflict resolution.
Ireland · Cait Finnigan, a senior majoring in history, waits for students to ask her questions about the program at the study abroad fair Wednesday. - Alex Dealy | Daily Trojan
Provided through the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts & Sciences Office of Overeseas Studies, the program will send students to study at the Trinity College Dublin, Irish School of Ecumenics in spring 2012.
The course was first offered late last fall, but was cancelled because of a lack of interest and a shortened timeline.
This semester the office is confident students will respond to the opportunity because of practical emphasis and relevance.
“Conflict resolution is a huge deal, not only post-Sept. 11, but it always has been,” said Peter Hilton, associate director of the office. “This program gives students a chance to study conflict resolution in a particular context that is not only applicable to global conflict but any conflict in general.”
The program provided students with information during Wednesday’s study abroad fair and  the office was optimistic about the draw of Belfast itself.
“[Belfast] used to be a city people avoided and now it is a city people are attracted to,” said Adam Hempling, a study abroad adviser. “It not only offers an opportunity to engage and go have fun, but it also offers an opportunity to engage in history and see how a city has emerged from conflict.”
Katie King, a senior majoring in anthropology, said she learned a lot when studying in Northern Ireland last summer.
“The coolest thing about this is you see [conflict resolution] firsthand,” King said. “It’s really incredible to be a part of it. It’s definitely worth it for undergrads to see the issues personally.”
Hempling also said all majors can apply to the program and credit can be given toward degrees in international relations, religion, anthropology and sociology. Students interested in the program are required to check with their study abroad advisers to get final approval.
Applications for the program are due Monday, Sept. 12.

A resident of the University Park campus for more than 20 years, Stanley Rosen tells students to call him “Stan.”
Rosen, the faculty master of the University Residential College at Birnkrant, eats alongside freshmen every day at Everybody’s Kitchen and says he encourages students to join him.

“The main thing is to make them comfortable with faculty members outside the classroom,” said Rosen, a professor of political science.
Rosen is one of 15 faculty members living in student housing this year. Administrators plan to create three more residential colleges like Birnkrant starting next school year, said Lynette Merriman, senior associate dean for Student Affairs.
“What we’re trying to do here is really blend the living and learning experience,” Merriman said.
Faculty members currently live in the North, South, East and Parkside areas. In fall 2012, the residential college program will expand and a new faculty master be placed in both Flour and Webb Towers, and added to the two already in the South Area — which includes Pardee Tower and Deans Halls.
What distinguishes faculty masters from other resident faculty members is that masters have tenure and are active on campus and in their field, Merriman said.
“We would like [residential colleges] to be a common experience among all students,” said Merriman, who also said USC is pushing to become an even more residential campus in coming years.
Gene Bickers, vice provost for Undergraduate Programs, said the idea for residential colleges stems back centuries ago in England with some of the oldest universities such as Oxford university.
“We’re not trying to imitate anyone in particular, but we know that there are benefits that come with having students and faculty live together,” Bickers said. “We’re trying to give everyone those benefits.”
Jay Lee, a freshman majoring in theatre and living in Birnkrant, said one of the things he was most excited about when coming to USC was living alongside a faculty member.
“They’re so intelligent here and it’s just a great set-up and opportunity to just kind of connect and bond with some of the adults here on campus,” Lee said.
Priya Jaikumar, associate professor in the School of Cinematic Arts who lives in Parkside Arts and Humanities, said she believes significant teaching happens beyond the classroom.
“If the university wants to contribute to the larger life of students, it’s important to take responsibility for what the students are doing once they’re leaving the classroom,” Jaikumar said.
Merriman said the recruitment process for new resident faculty members will begin in coming weeks.
This is wonderful! I can’t wait till the new UV is built and this expands. USC will truly be a peer among the elite.

A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Monday shows Republican candidates Rick Perry and Mitt Romney tied among California Republicans.
These results came days before the GOP presidential candidate debate, which was held Wednesday night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. There, the eight main Republican candidates met to discuss their plans for the future and distinguish themselves from one other.
“Until about a couple of weeks ago the Republican primary was who could say the meanest thing about president Obama,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “But as the primary gets closer it will get much nastier and
much uglier.”
Schnur also said the debate was pivotal for Perry as he attempts to appeal to voters outside of Texas.
“The challenge for Perry is to realize that what works for Texas may not work for the rest of the country,” Schnur said.
The USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy and the Unruh Institute organized a live viewing of the debate and a discussion after with Schnur and Roberto Suro, a professor of journalism and public policy.
USC College Republicans also organized a group of students to volunteer and watch the debate in person.
The poll results, in addition to showing that Perry and Romney are tied as the leaders among the GOP candidates, indicate Californians — both Republicans and Democrats — are more interested in their politicians fighting for their causes instead of compromising.
“Voters like the idea of compromise,” Schnur said in a press release. “They just want the other side to do the compromising.”
The poll was conducted in late August, and interviewed more than 1,500 Californians from across the state to determine public opinion on the Republican primaries, the presidential election, President Obama and the upcoming anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Students’ reactions to the poll results were varied. Many were uninterested in the results and the primary process in general.
“[In] this election, versus ’08, students aren’t getting involved as much,” said Anjali Naskar, a senior majoring in international relations and global business and vice-chair of USC College Republicans. “When there’s an incumbent in office, I think a lot of students are just apathetic about [the election].”
Others said they found the poll results and debate to be important because of the power the GOP has in Congress.
“It’ll be interesting since [Republicans] control the House,” said Helen Yuan, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences and history. “It’s a good time for the [Republican Party] to step up and show off their candidates.”
Some students expressed interest in voting in next June’s Republican primaries.
“When the Republican primaries come around, I will vote for Mitt Romney,” said Elliott Kleiman, a junior majoring in history.  “I [did] not watch the GOP debates though. I’ll just watch the recap online.”
The two front-runners, Romney and Perry, were followed by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) with 11 percent, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) with 10 percent and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich with six percent.
The eight main GOP candidates invited to the debate were Bachmann, Georgia businessman Herman Cain, Gingrich, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Paul, Perry, Romney and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.
Though some said they find the Republican primaries to be irrelevant in a traditionally Democratic state like California, students still find the primaries important.
“California is definitely a deep, deep blue state, but it’s important that we have a Republican presence as well,” said Emily Schrader, a senior majoring in political science and a member of USC College Republicans. “Minorities are always important.”
Students shared this sentiment, but for different reasons.
“The primaries are relevant because in 2012 we’re going to have to elect a president, and it’s going to affect our rights as college students, as well as the rights we have as adults,” said Rosie Murphy, a sophomore majoring in history and print and digital journalism.
Some students said they find the primaries frustrating because there are so many candidates that telling their platforms apart can be difficult.
“[The Republican candidates’] ideas all seem to be the same to me — very far to the right, all running on the platform of not-Obama,” said Julia Wang, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience.
“Voters like the idea of compromise,” ??  What planet are you living on Schnur?  Planet Liberal?  The correct statement is ‘Democrats, like the idea of compromise, especially when they aren’t the majority any longer.’
And, Huntsman?  Can you say ‘Obama plant’?  He sounded just like Obama, never answering any of the questions.  He side stepped everyone, rambling on with drivel.
Hey Huntsman!  Most Americans are smarter than you or Obama.  Just watch the 2012 elections.
[…] too. It appeared as though there was no clear winner of the debate, though most reports, including the Daily Trojan, stated that Perry and Romney tied. Share this:TwitterFacebookLike this:LikeBe the first to like […]

The Coliseum Commission has agreed to enter into negotiations with USC to grant the university a master lease, potentially giving USC complete managerial and operational control over the Coliseum.
The commission, a nine-member council in charge of the historic landmark, met Wednesday to discuss the possibility of negotiating the stadium’s ownership. A unanimous agreement to begin talking with USC was reached during the meeting’s closed session. If all goes well, a final deal between the commission and the university is expected to be reached within 90 days.
“We are pleased that the Coliseum Commission has voted to enter into negotiations with USC,” said Thomas Sayles, vice president for University Relations, in a statement. “We hope that through these negotiations the parties can agree upon a long term lease that allows the Coliseum to be restored to its former glory and ensures its viability for many generations to come.”
USC has wanted to gain control of the Coliseum for years, and its last bid for ownership was in 2007. Then, it offered to make $100 million in renovations in exchange for the master lease. The commission declined, and instead promised to pay for $50 million in renovations by end of the month. The commission has been unable to keep its promise.
Athletic Director Pat Haden said last week that he’d be glad to see USC ownership of the stadium.
“If it ever happens, then we would welcome the opportunity and try to create a venue that our fans would really appreciate,” Haden said. “It would be a wonderful venue for our students, alumni and fans to watch our football team play.”
Bernard Parks, a member of the commission and the councilman representing the district including USC, expressed doubt last week that the commission and the university would enter negotiations this soon, but the commission’s inability to pay for the stadium’s renovations played a role in Wednesday’s decision.
Parks has long been the one dissenting vote against USC’s request for ownership, but Wednesday he finally agreed to begin a discussion over private ownership of the Coliseum. Parks had previously advocated maintaining public control of the Coliseum and trying to bring in additional tenants to grow the stadium’s revenue. Specifically, he wanted to see the Coliseum play host to an NFL team, which he contended would be good for the stadium and the city.
Owning the Coliseum means USC could veto any attempt to bring an NFL team there. USC has said, however, that it would be willing to come to an agreement if Los Angeles is presented with an NFL team.
“We are open to discussions on a mutually beneficial arrangement,” Sayles said in a press release. “Under our current lease, we have the right to approve any other team playing football in the Coliseum during our season … If we were to receive a proposal, we would review it.”
The Coliseum is an 88-year-old historic landmark that has hosted two Olympic games and two Super Bowls.
“As a loyal and dedicated tenant of over 80 years, we want to return the Coliseum to its former glory and be the caretaker it deserves for future generations,” Sayles said. “To that end, we have believed for some time that having a master lease would be in the best long-term interests of the community and the university.”
More specific legal and financial details will be discussed before the commission’s next meeting Dec. 7.
