The crowds who watched the space shuttle Endeavour make its aerial journey over Los Angeles in September will get a much closer view this weekend.
Endeavour is set to slowly roll on specialized, computerized transporters from a hangar at Los Angeles International Airport to its permanent home at the California Science Center early Saturday night. Its arrival will make the Science Center in Exposition Park, which is adjacent to USC, the only museum in the world to house a complete space shuttle.
Crowds are expected to gather to watch the shuttle as it creeps along its route. Those who are interested can view the shuttle from 9:00 to 9:30 a.m. when it will stop at the Forum in Inglewood for an official ceremony in front of about 14,000 spectators. At 1:30 p.m., it will pass another public viewing place at the intersection of Crenshaw Boulevard and West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
Students can also watch Endeavour pull into Exposition Park around 5:30 p.m., according to Kristina Kurasz, a communication associate at the California Science Center.
Many students are looking forward to the chance to see Endeavour.
“Personally, I am very excited,” said Dan Morgan-Russell, a freshman majoring in international relations/global business. “This is a great opportunity to see first-hand such a magnificent piece of America’s scientific history.”
Endeavour’s 12-mile crawl to the museum, however, has been a logistical difficulty as much as it will be a spectacle. Moving such a large object — Endeavour’s wingspan of 78 feet stretches nearly seven traffic lanes — is a huge security and safety issue for anything or anyone in its path. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has warned Angelenos that road closures and additional security will cause heavy traffic delays throughout the day Saturday.
“Along the shuttle route we will actually be taking down traffic signals and signs as the shuttle passes and then re-installing them after,” said Jonathan Hui, a spokesperson for the LADOT.
Hui explained that the process of transporting the shuttle will be time-intensive because the maximum moving speed is only two miles per hour. The shuttle is expected to leave LAX around 2 a.m. and arrive at Exposition Park in the afternoon. Additionally, there will be frequent public viewing opportunities where the shuttle will not move for several hours.
The traffic mayhem caused by Endeavour is expected to affect the neighborhood around USC starting around 4 p.m. on Saturday, when the roads along West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard will begin to shut down. Hui explained that students should expect closures and traffic along Vermont and Western avenues as well.
The roads will re-open by 10 p.m. on Saturday after Endeavour safely reached the Science Center.
“As far as USC is concerned, there will be a lot of officials for additional security and members of the public trying to see the shuttle near campus on Saturday,” Hui said. “Traffic may be affected, so just be aware and plan accordingly.”
USC’s Department of Transportation assures students that aside from traffic, there will not be any major issues on campus regarding Endeavour’s arrival.
USC Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said there might be more crowding in campus parking facilities, but most of the chaos will be on the south side of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which will be heavily staffed by Los Angeles Police Department officers.
After the shuttle arrives on site, one wall of the new exhibit’s main pavilion at the Science Center will be removed in order to move it inside.
The Science Center exhibit, which will display Endeavour along with artifacts, interactive video and information about space exploration, opens Oct. 30. The public is encouraged to purchase a timed ticket beforehand to ensure entrance into the exhibit.
“We are very excited to have the participation of not only the city-wide agencies that we are working with but also the participation of the public,” said Shell Amega, spokeswoman for the California Science Center. “We are glad they are as excited as we are, but we also ask that they bear with us as Endeavour is transported.”

The USC Brain and Creativity Center, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association and Heart of Los Angeles joined forces for a groundbreaking research project, USC announced Monday.
The study, titled “Effects of Early Childhood Musical Training on Brain and Cognitive Development” will follow students in an intense music program in order to track their learning and brain function.
Researchers will study two groups of 40 first graders over the course of five years. The children will all be of similar socio-economic background and cognitive ability to start, but one group will be in the HOLA music program and the other will not. Each year, the students will be given psychological and behavioral tests, as well as brain scans to track the physical and functional aspects of the brain.
Dr. Assal Habibi of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute and Beatriz Ilari of the Thornton School of Music will work directly with the children and their families and collect the data. They will be assisted by graduate students and research assistants and supervised by Professors Hanna and Antonio Damasio, directors of the USC Brain and Creativity Institute and the Dornsife Neuroimaging Institute at USC.
Habibi, herself a musician as well as a neuroscientist, said she hopes the survey will help uncover the effects of music education in terms of not only academics, but also social and emotional development and cognitive abilities.
“We are looking to discover what, systematically, difference does it make in the lives of these children,” Habibi said.
HOLA, a nonprofit organization that offers free after-school programs for underprivileged youth in art, sports and academics, already has a partnership with the LA Philharmonic — The Youth Orchestra LA. YOLA, which is in its third year, serves 240 local students ages six to 14, with most attending 15 hours of music class per week. The children are admitted as first graders, and must make a commitment to the program and to upholding their values.
Officials approached HOLA and YOLA directors last spring about the survey, and they were immediately intrigued.
“When I saw who was going to be involved, I thought it was going to be incredible,” HOLA Executive Director Tony Brown said. “This will be groundbreaking for the field.”
Similar studies have been made previously, but none over such a long period of time. The unique aspect of this survey is that the training is done as an ensemble. Most research projects study merely musical training and lessons, while YOLA adds another layer of working on music in a more social environment.
Habibi is looking forward to seeing how this type of training influences social development, as well as recognition of emotions.
Brown feels that this partnership is very exciting, as all three groups are leaders in their prospective fields.
“This study will be great for all of us, but even greater for society as a whole,” Brown said. YOLA staff hopes the survey will not only help their own publicity, but also help with promoting music education nationwide.
Many parents with children in the YOLA program agree, and have been extremely supportive of the study. Some children who will be participating in the survey have siblings who have been with YOLA since its start three years ago.
“Many families are excited about the opportunity to help students around the country have access to music education,” YOLA Director Christine Witkowski said.
The staff at HOLA have already formed their own theories about the impact of music education, but they are hoping to obtain concrete evidence.
“We do surveys among students, and from the start of year to the end we see more willingness to try new things, a stronger sense of self esteem, more resilience and better general focus,” Witkowski said. “They have a passion for working with others, sharing with others and caring about others.”
Madeline Myers, a volunteer with YOLA who has worked as a music director for USC student productions, has made similar discoveries in her time teaching music.
“The goal of music education, particularly for disadvantaged youth, is to be the positive item in their lives that motivates them to stay in school, work hard, pursue their dreams, cultivate their passions, engage with the community and the world, and so much more,” Myers said.

Cynthia L. Hogle, an advocate for women in Afghanistan, discussed her work at a seminar Wednesday hosted by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. Hogle undertook projects to improve the lives of Afghan women in Maiwand, a village in the Taliban’s home province of Kandahar.
Overseas · Cynthia L. Hogle, an adviser to the Afghanistan World Foundation, explains her work encouraging Afghan women to speak their minds in a male-dominated society. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
According to Hogle, the rural village is incredibly poor and women have a literacy rate of only 7 percent.
Hogle is an international advisor to the Afghanistan World Foundation and a member of the American Support for Afghanistan Board. She also worked in Iraq as a public diplomacy officer for the U.S. Department of State and spent nine months in Afghanistan as a human terrain analyst with the United States Army.
Hogle spent months acquainting herself with women living in the village and gaining their trust, hoping that she could convince them to organize themselves to work together to progress toward a more gender-equal society.
Hogle said she held meetings for the women to gather and discuss what changes they wanted.
In some instances, the women would not leave their homes. Still, Hogle’s first meeting drew an unexpectedly large crowd of 94 women.
During this meeting, Hogle said the women called for the construction of a school for girls, the installation of a water pump and the chance to learn vocational skills. Hogle said she was shocked at the women’s eagerness to ask for such changes in a traditionally male-dominated Afghan village.
“They asked the district governor for things they wanted, and I think it’s pretty amazing that they asked for that straight up,” Hogle said. “These women have been looking for an opportunity, and as soon as they got it they went for it. If you give them a little bit of information and start responding to what they’re asking for, they’ll go for it.”
Meredith Deane, a graduate student studying public diplomacy, said that she was surprised husbands allowed their wives to attend meetings that called for such revolutionary change.
“The women wouldn’t even be there in those meetings if it wasn’t for the men allowing them to,” Deane said. “The fact that there are men out there [in Afghanistan] who aren’t all anti-feminist was pretty amazing to me.”
One of Hogle’s main accomplishments was the construction of a women’s center in Maiwand, which was prompted by the women’s desire for a place for their daughters to learn.
Hogle’s achievements, however, were no easy feat. According to Hogle, some male soldiers did not believe her claim that the women wanted a school to be built.
Additionally, Hogle claimed that the lack of cooperation between everyone working at her military base was a huge problem that has yet to be fixed.
“I pushed the envelope many times, I was the woman who would not back down. [The school] happened against all odds,” Hogle said. “In the end you have to fight for it, and that’s what these women had to do. I used to tell the women, ‘You think you have problems talking to men — but they don’t like to listen to me either.’”
Hogle’s discussion of her projects motivated some students to work for similar improvements around the world.
Tiantian Xiang, a graduate student studying strategic public relations, said that women in other countries are just as desperate for such an opportunity.
“I want to go into PR for non-profit organizations,” Xiang said. “I’m from China and I know that there are some rural places in China where women stay at home and don’t really talk to women a lot. So maybe something like this can be done in China too.”

Students watched the only 2012 vice-presidential debate screening between Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan on Thursday night in Taper Hall.
Viewing · Students gather to watch the vice-presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan Thursday in Taper Hall. – Zhaoyu Zhou | Daily Trojan
The debate, hosted by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, focused on foreign and domestic issues, such as the nuclear threat from Iran, the stagnant unemployment rate and abortion. Both Biden and Ryan worked to clarify their running mates’ stances on the topics.
The debate was held at Centre College in Danville, Ky., and moderated by Martha Raddatz, a foreign affairs correspondent for ABC News.
The debate started on a somber note, by discussing the recent terrorist attack on American ambassadors in Benghazi, Libya; Raddatz questioned the vice presidential candidates about how each administration will effectively handle future terrorist threats. Ryan criticized the Obama administration’s response to the Benghazi event and highlighted other incidents of inefficiency that he said led to a lack of credibility for the administration overseas.
“This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself, but unfortunately it’s indicative of a broader problem,” Ryan said. “And that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.”
Biden pushed back later in the debate, showing the weaknesses in the Romney-Ryan plans on Medicare and Social Security.
“And in regard to Social Security, we will not privatize it,” Biden said. “If we had listened to Romney, Governor Romney, and the congressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market. Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.”
The vice-presidential candidates did not only differ on policy during the debate, but also in their presentation.
During each round of the debate, Biden continually displayed energy and quick responses to Ryan’s statements. The current vice president smirked and grinned at Ryan’s statements and repeatedly called him “friend” before negating his opponent’s statements.
“Biden had a lot more aggression,” said Maya Jackson, a sophomore film and television production major who watched the debate in Taper. “Ryan was much more calculated, almost as if he had practiced his answers in the mirror the night before.”
Compared to Obama’s performance in the presidential debate last week, Biden’s  liveliness signaled increased excitement for the Democratic base, according to Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior fellow at the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
“Debates are good for getting the base fired up and that’s what Biden did,” Bebitch Jeffe said.
According to a CNN poll of debate watchers, 48 percent believed Ryan won, and 44 percent perceived Biden as the winner.
Students who attended the screening said they believed the debate was not overly influential to the outcome of the race.
“It was nice to listen to them,” said Negin Baradari, a graduate student studying entertainment law. “But they really didn’t say anything new.”
Bebitch Jeffe said though this debate might have served as a morale boost, it might not benefit each presidential candidate in the polls.
“I don’t think debates move the needle too much one way in favor for a candidate,” Bebitch Jeffe said. “But it definitely won’t hurt either candidate. Ryan held his own and didn’t lose any ground for the Republicans and Biden did much better than the president did by revving up the Democrats.”
Students also said they believe that the debate did little to sway undecided voters.
“I’m personally undecided,” Jackson said. “I felt a few things were cleared up, but I think this debate was more for the people who already know who they’re voting for.”
The next presidential debate will be held Oct. 16.

As the Women of Troy reach the halfway point of conference play this weekend, they are struggling through a four-game winless streak. The urgency is picking up for the squad to start earning wins instead of the close losses and ties that have plagued them.
With Sunday’s 1-0 overtime loss to Oregon, the Women of Troy (4-6-3, 1-2-2) set a program record with five consecutive overtime games, which began innocently enough with a 1-0 victory over Washington on Sept. 21 to kick off conference play.
Since then, overtime hasn’t been so kind to the team, which has felt the physical effects of playing 10 extra periods this season.
Sophomore midfielder Alex Quincey suffered a leg injury two weeks ago and won’t play in Friday’s game at Washington State. Junior midfielders Elizabeth Eddy and Haley Boysen both suffered concussions last weekend and are considered game-time decisions.
“[Overtime games] are really tiring, and I think that’s what’s affecting the girls most,” junior midfielder Autumn Altamirano said. “Our legs are absolutely dead, but we’re used to it now.”
USC coach Ali Khosroshahin admires the fight his squad has shown to extend matches but hopes they can find a way to close out opponents in regular time.
“It says to me that we have a lot of intangibles and a lot of character,” Khosroshahin said. “Unfortunately, it also says to me that we haven’t been quite able to put our intelligence behind those intangibles.”
This last week, as he felt his freshmen-heavy team getting frustrated, Khosroshahin called a team meeting between all the coaches and players to air out any concerns.
“Anytime you have a group of young players, there’s questions as to why people play, why some people don’t travel with the team, and those things can become a distraction,” Khosroshahin said. “We just needed a commitment as to what it is [the players] all need to be doing, and what we as coaches need to be doing.”
Altamirano admitted the Women of Troy, who are currently tied for eighth in the Pac-12, have been frustrated by the winless streak.
“It’s been really, really hard,” Altamirano said. “The girls have been kind of down, but we’re motivated now.”
The Women of Troy do have a bit of good news to look forward to: Friday’s match against the Cougars (8-4-1, 2-2-1) marks the last road game of the season for USC, which will end the season with a five-game homestand.
Washington State has played well at home, accruing a 4-1-0 record in Pullman this season.
The Cougars, led by goalkeeper Gurveen Clair, are especially strong on defense. They’ve only given up one goal at home all season, and at one point had a streak of seven straight shutouts.
Washington State runs their offense through forwards Micaela Castain and Brandi Vega, who have combined for 13 of the team’s 26 goals.
Castain is tied for second in the conference with eight goals, four game-winning goals and goals per game (0.62).
Khosroshahin is confident USC’s defense, which has allowed one goal in each of the last three games, has turned a corner after ranking last in the Pac-12 in goals allowed for most of the season.
Now he’s hoping the offense, which has scored only two goals in the last three games, can find its groove.
“Lately, when we don’t defend well, we score a lot, and when we do defend well we don’t score enough,” Khosroshahin said. “It’s just a weird funk we need to get out of.”
Altamirano said that if the team wants to attain its goal of reaching the NCAA tournament, they need to snap out of that funk as soon as possible.
“Basically, they’re all must-win games now,” Altamirano said. “We’re fighting now. We just have to finish our opportunities.”
USC kicks off against Washington State on Friday at 1 p.m.

With USC’s sixth game of the season approaching on Saturday, the No. 11 Trojans are doing everything they can to prepare for the road matchup against Washington.
Familiarity · Last season, T.J. McDonald (left) and the Trojans routed Washington 40-17 at the Coliseum. In 2012, the Huskies are undefeated at home. They last defeated USC in Seattle during the 2009 season. – Daily Trojan file photo
Such preparation includes getting ready for potential rainfall in Seattle, Wash., as the coaches and managers sprayed the players with sprinklers and hoses during individual drills in practice yesterday.
“The guys are excited to go play and ready to go to a very hostile environment versus a team that is undefeated at home,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We know they’re going to throw everything at us.
The Trojans will have had eight days of rest after their 38-28 win over Utah last Thursday, and Kiffin believes the team has benefitted greatly from the time off.
“Our guys have really good legs right now,” Kiffin said. “Our guys look really fast. It feels like we’ve had a full bye.”
Kiffin confirmed that junior cornerback Torin Harris will start opposite of junior cornerback Nickell Robey, despite sophomore safety Josh Shaw seeing some snaps at the position.
“We think Torin is going to continue to improve,” Kiffin said. “As we know, he missed a lot of time, so hopefully this week he shows some improvement.”
Another player to look for in the back seven is sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, who Kiffin praised yesterday for his intuitive play recognition.
“Dion really can understand everything.,” Kiffin said. “It’s very unusual to have a guy to play in base and then play in nickel like he does. He’s really able to diagnose the stuff coming out of a play real fast.”
Bailey has three interceptions and 35 tackles on the year, and the Trojans look to him to help anchor the pass defense against Washington quarterback Keith Price.
Though Price only has a 74.9 quarterback rating so far this season, Kiffin believes he can still be one of the elite passers in the conference and the country.
“He’s the same quarterback that lit up the [Alamo Bowl],” Kiffin said. “There’s been a lot of good quarterbacks to play [at Washington], and he’s broken almost all the records.”
In Washington’s 67-56 loss to Baylor in the Alamo Bowl last season, Price threw for four touchdowns and 438 yards and added three rushing touchdowns.
This year, Price has five touchdowns and four interceptions through five games. Many have pointed to an injury-ridden offensive line as the reason for Price’s struggles.
“It’s going to be difficult when your offensive line is changing, you lose a receiver and you lose two tailbacks,” Kiffin said. “That’s not easy for any quarterback to deal with.”
Washington running back Jesse Callier is out for the season with a torn ACL, while running back Chris Polk and receiver Jermaine Kearse now play in the NFL.
Despite the changes, Kiffin claimed that Washington coach Steve Sarkisian has done a good job adjusting to his available pieces on offense.
“He wants to play to his personnel and to a quarterback that moves around pretty good. They sort of have a spread element,” Kiffin said. “That’s what good coaches do. They involve their personnel.”

In what has become an annual tradition in advance of USC’s matchups with the Huskies, Washington coach Steve Sarkisian once again praised USC for having superior talent to the rest of the Pac-12. But this time, Sarkisian notably changed his phrasing in one subtle respect: He referred solely to the Trojans’ starting offensive and defensive lineups.
“I know Lane hates when I say this, but they’re probably the most talented team in our conference when you just look at their starting 22,” Sarkisian said during a news conference Monday.
Kiffin has never embraced the former Trojan assistant’s praise of his roster, because, since becoming head coach in 2010, there have been times when USC’s record clearly didn’t reflect its talent. Understandably, Kiffin likely interprets such a comment as a back-handed compliment. If the talent’s so great, then fans can only blame the coaching for shortcomings.
“He says that every year,” Kiffin said in response during an interview on USC’s athletic. “He’s just going to say that no matter what.”
After all, if USC was truly the most talented team in the Pac-12 each of the three years Sarkisian will have faced his former team, the Trojans presumably wouldn’t have lost eight conference games from 2010-11 and their conference opener this season at Stanford.
Sarkisian — much like Kiffin, I might add — is the ultimate gamesman, never one to forgo the opportunity to inflate his opponent’s resume or wax poetic about another team’s star player. There’s no harm in this philosophy: If Washington loses, the Huskies fell to a gifted Trojan team. If Washington wins, however, it’s a banner upset, announcing the Huskies’ arrival in the Pac-12’s upper echelon.
Ignoring Sarkisian’s possible pretext, I’ll agree with his sentiment this time around: This year, USC does field the best starting 22 out of any team in the Pac-12, and it’s really not particularly close. In the next few years, USC’s 2012 starting 22 will yield more NFL draft picks than any other conference competitor’s.
Let me clarify: This does not mean USC is the best team. Until proven otherwise, Oregon retains that mantle.
Still, as an exercise, let’s compare the two teams’ starting offensive lineups and indulge in a fantasy scenario in which Kiffin was given Oregon’s and USC’s starting offensive lineups, but could pick only 11 players to field a super-starting offense.
Even though Oregon’s offense averages 52.3 points per game compared to USC’s 34, it’s unlikely Kiffin would choose to field many Oregon starters.
Aside from all-purpose threats Kenjon Barner and De’Anthony Thomas, who on the Ducks’ offense would start for USC? Offensive tackle Nick Cody might supplant sophomore left tackle Aundrey Walker and tight end Colt Lyerla — often used at fullback — might replace redshirt freshman Soma Vainuku, but I doubt Kiffin, if given the chance, would pluck any other players from Oregon’s vaunted offense to insert into his starting lineup.
To continue this scenario further on the defensive side of the football, Oregon’s starting defensive talent is much more commensurate with USC’s, but Kiffin would still be hard-pressed to tinker too much with his roster in this fantasy scenario.
Middle linebacker Michael Clay — a Lombardi Award candidate — would likely replace sophomore Lamar Dawson. Either Ifo Ekpre-Olomu or Terrance Mitchell would start at USC’s perilously-thin second cornerback spot. And Dion Jordan, a 2011 All-Pac-12 first-team performer, would without question occupy one of the defensive end positions.
Beyond these three switches, however, it’s difficult to make an overwhelming case that Kiffin would wish to exchange any other starting USC defensive players for Oregon’s.
Yet, USC allows 19.4 points per game and Oregon surrenders just 20, including a combined 21 points to Arizona and Washington — more explosive offenses than any team USC has played to date.
After completing this thought experiment, how is it possible not to determine that Chip Kelly is simply a far better coach than Kiffin and can extract more talent out of his roster?
Surely Kelly is a better coach than Kiffin, but that’s not a biting criticism of Kiffin and the gap isn’t as expansive as the exercise just demonstrated, no one extracts more talent from his players and tailors his schemes to fit his players’ strengths better than Kelly.
Right now, the Mount Rushmore of current college coaches is Alabama’s Nick Saban, Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, Boise State’s Chris Petersen and Kelly.
So why should Kiffin get a pass and why shouldn’t USC fans clamor for his immediate dismissal?
Simply put, because of roster limitations, Kiffin doesn’t have the depth other top teams enjoy. USC’s starting 22 is better than Oregon’s, but its top 44 simply isn’t. The Trojans’ second-stringers don’t experience the competition for their backup roles that those of schools do.
The Ducks excel with unparalleled depth, rotating second- and third-string players just as capable as their starting counterparts.
Nothing illustrates this point better than the reality that, on USC’s allotted 70-player travel squad for Saturday’s game, the Trojans will bring several redshirting players and walk-ons.
Sarkisian and I are in agreement that USC fields the best starting 22 players in the Pac-12, but it doesn’t matter when a program like Oregon capitalizes on superior depth and coaching from a once-in-a-generation offensive guru.

The USC men’s water polo team continues its road trip this weekend, although it will be a very short trip. The No. 1 Trojans (15-0), playing their sixth consecutive away game, will travel to Westchester to take on Loyola Marymount in the team’s final non-conference game of the season.
On a roll · Sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias and USC have started the season 15-0. They are looking to win their fifth-straight national title. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
“Every game is important,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We take each game very seriously, whether it’s a conference game or not. Our guys are ready for tomorrow as well as conference games in the future.”
Saturday’s game against the Lions (11-6) serves as the team’s last test before the stakes are raised and each game matters. Once Mountain Pacific Conference play begins, just one loss could keep a top team out of the NCAA tournament.
“We’ve got ourselves lined up to be in really good shape to get in at-large bid of something goes wrong in the MPSF Tournament,” sophomore driver Rex Butler said. “We really want to start rounding into form so we can get a good kick at the end of the season.”
In last year’s meeting, USC easily handled LMU, winning by a score of 13-3 at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. In that game, sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias led all scorers with three goals. The Lions were playing with a heavy heart, as their head coach, John Loughran, was battling cancer and was spectating at the game. Loughran has since recovered and has now rejoined the team.
“Last year we beat them pretty easily,” Vavic said. “They were going through some tough times, with their coach battling cancer. He’s recovered, and I’m very happy to have him back. They should play a lot better this year.”
This year’s version of the Lions is on a streak at this point in the season. The winners of their last seven games, the team is averaging just fewer than 16 goals per game in each of those victories.
“They have a couple of good outside shooters,” Vavic said. “We’re going to have to be very aware because they have a lot of attacking weapons.”
LMU is headed by attacker Milutin Mitrovic, who leads the team in scoring with 32 goals. Slowing him down will be the focal point for the USC defense.
“[Mitrovic] is one of their key players,” Vavic said. “We need to know where he is at all times. It’s amazing that he’s only a freshman, but he is extremely dangerous and playing very well thus far.”
No matter how good their opponent is playing, USC players are confident that they will be able to continue their run of excellence through to the postseason. While maintaining their focus on the task at hand, the team knows that they should win the rest of their games, provided that they play to their full potential.
“We’re definitely prepared for these next opponents,” Butler said. “We’re coming off a big weekend, winning all those games by a pretty large margin. We have a lot of confidence. Hopefully, we can maintain this through conference play so we’ll be in full swing heading into the stretch run.”

USC coach Lane Kiffin knows Washington coach Steve Sarkisian quite well, of course.
The two served as assistants together at USC for five seasons under Pete Carroll in the early 2000s. During the final two years, they shared playcalling duties, Kiffin as the offensive coordinator and Sarkisian as the assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach. And since, they have kept in touch, remaining close friends.

But they will be on opposite sidelines come Saturday, as Kiffin and the No. 11 Trojans (4-1, 2-1) travel up the Pacific Coast to Seattle to face the Huskies (3-2, 1-1) — the third time the two head coaches have squared off against each other and the first time in the Evergreen State.
Washington has won two of the teams’ last three meetings with Sarkisian at the helm.
“I obviously have a great deal of respect for Lane and what he’s done there,” Sarkisian said Monday during a news conference with reporters. “That hasn’t been an easy task. He’s done a nice job. They’ve got a good football team.”
As “good” as USC might be, it also appears to be improving.
Following its mid-September loss at Stanford, the team has reeled off consecutive wins over California and Utah, climbing as high as No. 9 in the USA Today coaches’ poll, which counts as one-third of the BCS formula.
“Our guys have responded well,” said Kiffin, as his team enters its fourth road game of the season. “And I think they’ll do it again this week.”
In their previous matchup against the Utes, the Trojans’ passing game finally clicked. Senior quarterback Matt Barkley completed 23 of 30 passes for 303 yards and three touchdowns — 18 of them going to star wide receivers sophomore Marqise Lee and junior Robert Woods. Each finished with a touchdown as well.
On the season, the tandem has combined for 83 receptions, 921 yards and 12 touchdowns. And Lee’s 52 receptions and seven touchdowns rank as the third- and fourth-most in the country, respectively.
“I’m just doing what I’m supposed to do,” Lee said. “I worked harder. A lot of things I needed to improve on, and that’s what I improved on. My catching, my running [and I] got bigger thanks to the weight room coaches.”
Washington remains aware of all that.
“Lane’s a creative guy,” Sarkisian said. “He finds a variety of ways to get the ball in Lee’s and Woods’ hands, whether it’s the quick-screen game, whether it’s bringing them out of the backfield, whether it’s getting them one on one on the perimeter with corners, whether it’s with double moves down the field. He does a nice job moving them around.”
But despite 38 total points in its latest win, USC racked up its fair share of penalties against Utah, as it was penalized 14 times for 100 yards. And on the season, the Trojans have been penalized a total of 50 times, the fourth-highest among Football Bowl Subdivision teams.
Some of USC’s drives have stalled as a result.
“We’re making plays,” Barkley said. “We’re moving the ball downfield. But just at times we’re either doing stupid things like penalties, or it’s just one dropped ball or missed block where it can open up the game. Those plays will come.“
The Huskies have faced similar offensive difficulties as well, totaling more than 21 points just one time this season, a 52-13 win over Football Championship Subdivision Portland State on Sept. 15.
They can thank injuries for that, especially on the offensive line with a handful of potential starters out of the lineup. Junior tackle Erik Kohler and sophomore guard Colin Tanigawa have been sidelined for the year with knee injuries. Collectively, the unit features just one senior in center Drew Schaefer. As a result, quarterback Keith Price, who has thrown for 882 yards but has completed less than 60 percent of his passes, has faced quite a bit of pressure this season and has been sacked 12 times.
USC, comparatively, has sacked opposing quarterbacks 17 times this season, 11th most in the country.
Kickoff for Saturday’s game is scheduled for 4 p.m. at CenturyLink Field, the home of the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks. Husky Stadium is currently undergoing renovations. Still, noise is certainly expected.
“You go up there and the crowd is extremely loud,” Kiffin said. “They play better there. The concern for us is handling the crowd, playing with good composure.”
The game will be televised nationally on FOX.
Solid reporting, Joey.  I’m forwardding your piece to my Husky friends–and a few others around the conference who meet irregularly in Honolulu..
Fight On!

The current state of the video game industry is, to put it mildly, in danger of stagnating.
Like television networks and film studios, the major game developers seem extremely hesitant to take chances on ideas or properties that haven’t been proven to work. It’s a hard attitude to fight, especially considering the way the current industry market makes turning a profit extremely difficult even in the case of apparent hits.
For evidence, look no further than massive publisher Activision, which seemed to have a success on its hands with the Prototype franchise. The first game, released in 2009, warranted enough interest to merit the production of Prototype 2. The second installment managed to be the top-selling game in April, which certainly sounds like an achievement.
But despite what conventional wisdom might suggest, Prototype developer Radical Entertainment suffered massive layoffs after Activision determined that the sequel failed to find a “broad commercial audience.” It turns out that video game development, under current market practices, is such an expensive undertaking that the most popular game in a given month can still be considered a failure.
Considering the fate of Radical Entertainment wasn’t an isolated incident, it’s easy to understand why power players in the games industry are so concerned with appealing to the widest possible demographic. All games at the top tier of production — known as “AAA” releases — need blockbuster-level success to justify their investment. It’s the reason publisher Electronic Arts (third biggest behind Activision and Nintendo) is homogenizing their releases, with online co-op shoehorned into game series like Dead Space that were originally intended to be experienced alone. EA has also begun referring to its games as “services,” providing additional content over time that requires subscriptions or additional purchases. With games costing so much to make, consumers are no longer simply asked to buy them once.
While some American developers try to adapt their business practices and proliferate the same style of gameplay across all their titles, many Japanese developers are doing their best to imitate western games in an attempt to appeal to what they perceive as the all-powerful American market.
The latest and most unfortunate victim of this trend is unquestionably Resident Evil 6, the newest installment of Capcom’s beloved survival horror franchise. Declared a failure by most critics, it throws together every popular stereotype in modern gaming in an apparent attempt to capitalize on all of them, yet falls short across the board. The result is a disjointed mess — like the kid who dresses the same as the popular crowd and pretends to share their interests so that he can fit in, only to end up more of an outsider for his trouble.
This particular incident is a shame on two fronts. First of all, it wasn’t so long ago that the Resident Evil series led the pack, with 2005’s Resident Evil 4 hailed as the most well-constructed, revolutionary game of the year. It inspired countless trends in some of the most renowned games to hit stores for years to follow, but now Capcom has allowed the series to fall behind, playing catch-up to the descendants of its own imitators. Even worse, though, is that Capcom’s fearful need to appeal to the West was, in this instance more than any other, entirely unnecessary. The Resident Evil series is probably among the very properties that are recognized by enough of the gaming market to result in sizable profits regardless of whether or not it conformed to “Western sensibilities.” If the developers simply designed the game they wanted to make, the product undoubtedly would have been a hit critically and commercially. Instead, they made a game that more closely resembles the bloated, mindless actioners from the likes of Michael Bay than the subtler, more atmospheric installments from earlier in the series. Sure, there were always over-the-top elements and unintentional comedy, but they complemented genuinely frightening gameplay that skewed closer to the best of B-movie horror, not overstuffed blockbusters. That’s what it did best. But Resident Evil 6, in pursuing a non-stop thrill ride, fails to live up to the properties it imitates while alienating a great deal of the legion of Resident Evil fans who would have welcomed a return to form à la the fourth or fifth games in the series. As far as missteps brought on by creative bankruptcy in the games industry, it might be one of the worst offenders thus far.
And no doubt there is a legion of mistakes still to come. Video games as a medium are still in their infancy, with financial concerns dominating in the absence of creative know-how. But adaptation will come, slowly but surely, as developers learn to deal with evolving markets and the industry better-positions itself to negotiate between the worlds of the artistic and the commercial. The fans already know that video games are art — with an equal or perhaps greater capacity to affect us than other artist media. The only question is how long it will take to prove it.

An intriguing twist on the increasingly popular Asian fusion cuisine, which ranges from Singaporean chili crab to Malaysian chicken curry, can be found at a “permanent pop-up” restaurant in Downtown L.A.
Cap’n crunch · Starry Kitchen Night’s fried tofu balls were such a hit at the restaurant’s original location that they have now found their way to the menu of the “permanent pop-up.” The sriracha aioli drizzled atop each sphere serves as the spicy icing of sorts to this savory treat. – Tanaya Ghosh | Daily Trojan
Since closing its Cal Plaza doors, Starry Kitchen appeared once again last August, this time at Tiara Cafe on Ninth Street. One of the key differences is that the new location, called Starry Kitchen Nights, serves up family-style portions of bold Asian fusion flavors.
Though the location is a bit sketchy at night because of its pocketed Downtown location, once inside, one is transported to a laid-back atmosphere where the service is friendly, to say the least.
The paper menu is witty, with captions under select items that have a voice of their own. Upon meeting the owner, one might recognize the voice behind the eccentric quotations. Quirky captions such as “(WARNING: This dish is VERY Asian+ALMOST tastes like Asia itself ;D)” are sprinkled throughout the menu under dishes like the Niman Ranch ribeye beef satay noodles with dried shrimp.
Another entertaining element that makes for a complete dining experience at Starry Kitchen Nights is the amicable owner, Nguyen Tran. Outgoing and humorous, he chats with diners at length out of sheer friendliness.
During our interaction, Tran cracked jokes and explained that he and his wife, head chef Thi, started the Starry Kitchen concept after shutting down an early incarnation of the restaurant, a private kitchen run without a permit.
The husband-wife duo has since shuttered the doors of the original brick-and-mortar Starry Kitchen in pursuit of doing something new.
“I get bored easily,” says Tran.
Good personality and good food have led to coverage in many publications, but the couple stays humble as their main focus is food and changing up the menu to constantly offer creative, new items.
If you decide to try this pop-up for yourself, here’s a tip: Since many people come from afar just to order the Singaporean chili crab, reserve your crab(s) when you make your reservation. They might be costly — they come at market price — but they’re the most popular item on the menu for a reason.
“People have actually gotten mad at me for running out of the crab,” says Tran.
The crispy tofu balls are an appetizer that has deservedly remained on the repertoire from the previous Starry Kitchen menu. The deep-fried crunchy spheres have a crisped rice coating and come with a zesty sriracha aioli.
The sweet ginger chicken “WAAAAAAAAANGS” (yes, customers are encouraged to order it that way) are double-fried for the perfect crunch, coated with a sweet and sticky glaze and studded with a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds.
The pandan chicken consists of chicken wrapped and fried in a pandan leaf so the flavors infuse the bird. The pandan flavor can best be described as a nutty vanilla.
As for entrées, the fall-off-the-bone Malaysian chicken curry with purple Okinawan sweet potatoes and boldly flavored gravy complement the accompanying B1 Breadshop bread, which is used to sop up the spicy goodness. Those averse to heavy spices and dishes with heat might want to request a less spicy version, as the default preparation is not for the faint of heart.
The green curry tofu arrives in triangular pieces fried with a thin layer batter on the outside and tofu with custard-like consistency on the inside, served in a deceptively spicy light green sauce. More Okinawan potatoes and the light crunch of carrots add sweetness and texture to round out the flavors of this complex vegetarian dish.
For garlic lovers, the Japanese garlic noodles present major flavor reinforcement by building layers of garlicky flavor using whole cloves of confit garlic and garlic oil.
The claypot caramelized striped bass and pancetta can be considered an Asian variation on surf and turf, with the savory sauce at the bottom of the clay pot unifying the two proteins.
Even if one’s stomach has reached its full capacity, it would be a shame not to order dessert.
The salted plum lychee panna cotta is balanced between the salted plum topping and the delicately sweet lychee-flavored interior. The osmanthus panna cotta with red wine poached pears has subtler floral flavors, but is equally refreshing. The pillow-like five-spice apple fritters contain sour apple pieces sprinkled throughout, which go well with the sweet honey bourbon cream sauce, although the dip could use a bit more bourbon.
Even though you might be extremely full before dessert is even served, it is likely that you will have no problems finishing every last crumb and dollop on the dessert plate.

Point: Elena Kadvany
Vice President Joe Biden set a refreshing standard for the rest of the debates. He was feisty, firm, genuine, personal — and even more presidential than President Barack Obama.
Rep. Paul Ryan did not bomb the debate or make any ridiculous comments that will damage the Romney campaign. He did just fine. But that was the difference between him and Biden. Where Ryan seemingly stuck faithfully to a script chock-full of recycled campaign talking points, Biden was organic and believable. Where Ryan repeated criticism of Obama’s failed administration, Biden delivered a rare dose of honesty by admitting that there have been negative comments made during the election season that he regrets.
The difference between Biden’s and Ryan’s closing remarks reaffirmed Biden as the winner of tonight’s debate. Ryan might as well have been reading from a teleprompter. Biden returned to the infamous 47 percent gaffe, defending his and Obama’s unwavering commitment to the 47 percent, to the people, to leveling the playing field. He made this incredibly personal, citing his own mother and father as members of that 47 percent.
Biden ended with a simplistic, yet deeply meaningful comment: “And the president and I are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled … until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence, “Honey, it’s going to be OK. It’s going to be OK. That’s what this is all about.”
That is what this is all about. The importance of Biden’s honesty and emotion cannot be understated. For even the most adamant of Obama supporters, that feeling of genuine excitement about a candidate as a person and leader has faded. Tonight, Biden restored that sense of excitement.

Counterpoint: Sarah Cueva
Vice President Joe Biden has substantially more experience in the political realm, but relative newbie Rep. Paul Ryan came out on top in the vice presidential debate tonight. Not only did Ryan stick to concrete numbers and outline how a Romney-Ryan administration would differ from a second Obama-Biden stint in the White House, he also maintained a calmer and more presidential demeanor than the notoriously hotheaded Biden.
Sitting at Centre College in Danville, Ky., debate moderator Martha Raddatz started the duel with a pointed question regarding the Libya attack exactly one month ago. Beginning with this issue automatically put Biden on the defensive, as he scrambled to dismiss the Obama administration’s mishandling of the aftermath of the Benghazi attack and refocused the dialogue on such positives as the assassination of Osama bin Laden under President Barack Obama.
Biden was expected to have the edge in terms of foreign policy, especially given Ryan’s lack of experience in that arena. But Ryan’s clear outlining of where the Romney administration would fall — on everything from nuclear proliferation in Iran to troop withdrawal from Afghanistan — strengthened his image as a leader who would be capable of making tough decisions under extreme pressure.
This is not to say that Ryan was perfect in the debate. Much of what he said came across as rehearsed and forced. When asked about the specifics of the Romney-Ryan “five-point plan,” Ryan stuck to platitudes about cutting taxes and strengthening small business. Biden, however, did not offer a much better alternative in terms of facts, and he failed to adequately defend the Obama administration’s handling of the economy over the last four years.
Throughout most of the night, Biden acted the opposite of how a respectable vice president should in a political debate: scoffing at Ryan’s arguments, laughing and shaking his head when he heard something he disagreed with. Such behavior made him seem threatened by Ryan, even though Biden’s arguments themselves were coherent and impassioned.
Ryan came out on top with strong knowledge of foreign policy and unwavering stances on domestic policy. Though Biden is unquestionably more experienced politically, he failed to assert his dominance as the smarter choice for vice president.
Paul Ryan looks to be very inbred and resembles a muppet!!!!!!!! ha ha ha ha ha ha…………. ALL politicians are the epitome of lier’s and none can be trusted! We’re in a catch 22!
Wow Kevin. That’s all you need huh ?
How bout some facts on the policies you supposedly support. I find it funny that I’ve yet to run into a Republican that has a clear view of what their party stands for. Do you hear their platforms changing every time they speak, or do you only gain your info from the news ?
So please, explain to me what is you support, since all I hear is constant flip flopping around the board. Ryan didn’t say much at all, nor anything positive, (lets keep american troops overseas and keep pushing the bs theory of trickle down economics) – it takes a small mind to believe any of that crap. But those are the minds they want. Congrats
…this will be a one term presidency” . 
Mitt Romney has been a successful businessman and jobs creator everywhere he’s been. He has been successful working across the aisle with democrats. Mitt has done this at the private and state level…Obama was a community organizer and one term senator- no experience at all in business and job creation. I don’t see how anything outside of these irrefutable facts REALLY matters.
A level playing field means telling the successful to give up the fruits of their hard work? Where is the incentive to achieve greatness if when I do I have to give back more?! How is that right? 
Did Romney screw up on his 47% comment sure. He admitted it to. Better than the “y’all in chains” gaffe of good ole Joe, of which was not mentioned by Ryan. All Ryan did was attack Mr. Obama’s & Mr. Biden’s failed policies. They have had 4 yrs, 2 with a majority in congress and none of their promises from 2008 have been fulfilled. One promise they STILL can deliver…”if I fail this will

USC Trustee and developer Rick Caruso will not run for L.A. mayor in 2013, he announced in a statement Thursday night.
Caruso, the namesake for USC’s Catholic Center, is known for developing the Grove and the Americana at Brand shopping centers and for serving as a former city commissioner.
“As a lifelong Angeleno, I have dedicated my career to supporting Los Angeles through world-class developments, creating jobs and economic benefits and in working with civic and community organizations throughout Los Angeles,” Caruso said. “I look forward to continuing to contribute to our city by focusing on endeavors that enrich the lives of the people in this city.”
Caruso, who hired political consultants to help him with his decision, also considered challenging Antonio Villaraigosa in 2009, according to the Los Angeles Times.
He also resigned from the Coliseum Commission in September 2011, after worries that his position on the panel conflicted with his role as a trustee for USC, which had expressed interest in controlling the stadium.

Between now and Nov. 18, six days remain to catch Cymbeline at Pasadena’s A Noise Within Theatre. No lover of Shakespeare should miss it.
Damsel in distress · As the lead, Imogen, Helen Sadler is the only actor playing one character in A Noise Within’s take on Cymbeline. – | Photo courtesy of A Noise Within Theatre
First produced in 1611 and rarely performed since, the Bard’s dark fairytale receives an invigorating revival that resonates with the extreme themes of today. The blindly passionate characters might speak in the tongue-tying manner of “thou” and “thee” from Early Modern English, but the lessons learned — to follow your heart and find hope from despair — are very 2012 and are captured by an enthralling production that perfectly plays out every line of Shakespeare’s fantastical imagination.
One of Shakespeare’s final plays, Cymbeline constitutes a romance and a tragicomedy, the joyous reconciliation at the end distinguishing it from earlier tragedies. It doesn’t fail, however, to emphasize the ever-present uncertainties and dangers of an evil world.
A dark fairy tale in and of itself, the play follows the journey of Imogen, the daughter of Cymbeline, king of Britain. During this journey, identities get traded, infants stolen, villains beheaded, lovers reconciled and potions concocted. Throw in a couple of yodeling, vine-lassoing Tarzan boys — lost sons of Cymbeline and brothers to Imogen — and you have the magic of  Cymbeline.
The play is a melting pot of Shakespeare’s past works, with characters flitting in from other stories. The Imogen-Cymbeline pairing mirrors the father-daughter relationship King Lear and Cordelia. The Queen, stepmother of Imogen, schemes similarly to Lady Macbeth. The rouge Iachimo parallels Othello’s Iago, while the green-eyed monster of Othello himself makes an appearance in the psyche of Posthumus, this time triggered by a bracelet rather than a strawberry handkerchief. In this way, Cymbeline is a classic Shakespearean puzzle.
And in real life, in real time, director Bart DeLorenzo lifts it all into the spotlight. Approaching Shakespeare’s arcane syntax with effortless naturalism, DeLorenzo makes the leap from page to stage without having to alter any of the Bard’s language. His handling of a stellar cast results in literal widespread emotional nuance, with actors making use of not just the stage but the entire theater: The characters dash up and down the aisles, entering from behind the audience to the stage, making for a very surround-sound — and action-packed — experience. At times, the Queen, in her silver gown and evil cunning, could be just an arm’s length away.
If some of the players look familiar, rest assured, it’s not a hallucination. In order to underline the fine line between good and evil, DeLorenzo cast each actor, save the actress playing Imogen (Helen Sadler), with two roles, one “good” and one “bad” character. By making these significant doublings, he is able to underline the distinction between good and evil. The ease of the actors’ transformations happens the way Shakespeare seemingly intended, a testimony to the marvelous talent here.
Adam Haas Hunter inhabits Posthumus, Imogen’s romantic hero, and Cloten, the comic villain, with unerring honesty. Likewise, Joel Swetow takes on the role of both hard-hearted King Cymbeline and Philario, Posthumus’ best buddy. Andrew Elvis Miller pulls puckish Iachimo’s machinations from his marrow, while donning the noble attire of Roman ambassador Caius Lucius. The rest of the cast, including Francia DiMase’s (the Queen) and Time Winters (Pisanio) might have just walked off the pages.
The lead, Helen Sadler, becomes one with the courageous, hotheaded, love-enthralled heroine Imogen. In a seamless, selfless ensemble, the artists portray their characters astoundingly well.
Meticulous designers Angela Balogh Calin and Monica Lisa Sabedra match each character with the most sweeping fusion fairytale fashions and makeup, as if sewing a second skin. The audience won’t forget the bouncing explosion of rusty curls sprouting from snobbish Cloten’s head any time soon, nor will they lose sight of the cleverly designed headless body of Cloten after Guiderius decapitates him.
From the start, the airy, dancing woodwind music of composer John Ballinger sets the mood for a story dark enough to awe, yet light enough to elicit laughs. The lighting, designed by Ken Booth, is also impressive, creating moments in which scenes overlap to point out underlying themes. During Imogen and Posthumus’ heartbreaking separation, both lovers were in the same spotlight, a symbolic gesture displaying how close they are despite the miles that stretch between them.
Though spoken in Early Modern English, the timeless humor is not lost on the audience. The antagonists deftly swing the audience to their side with one-off remarks. The outrageously unreal scenes, dramatic irony thickly lathered in the lines and the play’s signature, outlandish, off-balanced fun will entice snickers throughout the experience.
For all its wit and depth, Cymbeline is no mere tragedy-turned-comedy, but a pulse-quickening, enchanting literary confection, done full justice by A Noise Within’s perceptive edition, now a company benchmark.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney gave a foreign policy speech Monday at the Virginia Military Institute — an appropriate setting for a speech focused on war.
Robert Calcagno | Daily Trojan
Romney touched on many foreign policy issues, including the Syrian conflict, Iran’s potential acquisition of nuclear weapons, relations with Israel and the United States’ overall role in the Middle East. To say that these are critical issues that deserve both candidates’ and voters’ attention is an understatement. But with Election Day only three and a half weeks away, Romney should be focusing on the wars being fought at home and what Americans really need from their president to fight these wars.
Romney devoted his first speech after the presidential debate to all things military. He pointed to how President Barack Obama has led the country astray in the Middle East and laid out his superior plan, which ranges from specific action, such as restoring the Navy to its original size by building “15 ships per year, including three submarines,” to vague sound bites about “[winning] new friends” in the Middle East and pursuing a transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014, all without a solid plan to leave the country.
With anti-Obama, patriotic rhetoric, these plans sound great. They undoubtedly appeal to a large number of voters. But if you read between the lines, there’s something Romney missed: how these plans distract from and add to issues we need to face at home.
Americans do not need the extra expense of increased military spending nor of building almost twice as many ships per year to expand the Navy (which would, by the way, increase the Navy’s budget to $200 billion by 2016, an increase from $156 billion this year).
Americans do not need a pursuit of an Afghanistan exit strategy, but a solid plan that will allow us to be out of the country by 2014 and no later. Our continued presence in Afghanistan is a burden on Americans personally and financially, and it does not allow Afghans the independence they need to truly grow and move forward toward democracy. Romney’s speech indicates that his main foreign policy theme is increased military action — the opposite of what the country needs.
And whether or not you agree with that, we’ve heard this all before. We’ve been beaten over the head with the Romney campaign rhetoric: All of the conflict in the Middle East is because of poor decisions made by Obama, and Romney is here to put the country on the right track.
What would really distinguish Romney as the better candidate would be to say something new, to give visibility to issues at home that have been ignored thus far in the election.
Why not give a speech at a community college on the importance of public education, and offer a realistic plan to help our country’s public schools? Why not visit Aurora, Colo. to talk about reforming gun control laws?
The election is so narrowly focused on discussing the economy and foreign policy, on making rousing speeches about these topics and on attacking the other candidates’ failures that many issues related to the day-to-day lives of Americans get lost in the mix.
Romney ended his speech with this statement: “The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror and war and economic calamity. It’s our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom and peace and prosperity.”
A true commitment to the path of “freedom, peace and prosperity” would not entail more war, but instead a refreshing stand for the American people that is in touch with what they truly want and need.

Though Romney’s proposed military buildup won’t make the United States look any better in the eyes of some of our international peers, emphasizing the Middle East as our foremost foreign focus will help put the nation back on track to military and economic security.
Particularly in the last decade, many Middle Eastern countries have adopted severely anti-Western dispositions. Internal strife has only made this worse: The Arab Spring, Iran’s nuclear program and unrest in Syria and Libya have put these countries on a global stage, making their unrest all the more dangerous.
As an example, Romney began his speech citing the nearly two dozen cases of anti-American violence last month — including the deaths of a U.S. Ambassador and three veterans in Benghazi, Libya — to illustrate just how dire the current situation is in the Middle East. And he’s right to do so: In terms of other foreign policy concerns, China is a looming economic threat, but they aren’t being openly hostile. The attacks in the Middle East are frequent enough that they don’t constitute random acts of violence. They are examples of organized terrorism directed at the United States, and with the election looming so close, both candidates should be clearly explaining how they plan to respond to these issues.
That’s not to say Romney’s plans are 100 percent on the right track. He plans to increase the size of the Navy, bolster security spending among NATO members with an additional 2 percent of gross domestic product and expand our presence in several Middle Eastern countries over the next couple years. All this can only drag the conflict on. But at least it’s a decisive action plan compared to what we’ve seen from President Barack Obama, who, after four years, still hasn’t delivered on his commitment to remove American soldiers from overseas. America certainly doesn’t need any more spending right now, and Romney has already committed to a deficit-neutral budget if he takes office. A plan to address the Middle East while subduing the national deficit covers two of America’s most pressing issues and could put the country back on a path to prosperity.
But in light of past administrations’ handling of foreign policy, Romney might have the right idea. Increasing military spending and presence is always a risky move — it could have the result of alienating countries that see the United States as a threat and further souring American sentiments toward military spending. But part of the reason is because this strategy hasn’t been successfully implemented. Former President George W. Bush’s administration botched the early years of war in the Middle East with unclear goals and questionable motives, while the Obama administration has made minimal progress. I don’t support a direct increase in military power, but I also don’t know everything about foreign affairs — a new, decisive leader could be just what America needs to wrap things up once and for all.
Romney wants to return the United States to its former position as a “global leader.” And though the strategy for doing so is up for debate, it’s tough to argue that Romney’s plan won’t make it a reality. We are in an extremely fragile situation with the Middle East, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to remove ourselves from their affairs.
Romney’s foreign policy strategy isn’t guaranteed to work, but it acknowledges a truth Obama has ignored: If we don’t find a solution to resolve anti-Western sentiments soon, we will only exacerbate the problem and cause further issues for America down the road. Romney promises to put the nation on a road to “freedom, peace and prosperity” — voters need to keep this goal in mind and support the best plan of action to get us there.

The types of  crimes committed by the fbi/cia/dod,etc., as I have witnessed over the course of my lifetime are not new to mankind; indeed, for as long as man has walked on the face of the earth he has been confronted with his own savagery and  inhumanity to fellow man. War has become  legal; fbi/cia covert intelligence operations (including mass murder and other assassinations & tortures) are well known by many but never spoken about in polite conversations because they are also legal by awful custom. Thus, the end game for man is now being shaped by the most barbaric feature of his character: men’s criminal urge to destroy one another for myriad purposes. Mark Twain perhaps captured this truth as he said,
” A crime preserved in a thousand centuries ceases to be a crime, and becomes a virtue. This is the law of custom, and custom supersedes all other forms of law.”
