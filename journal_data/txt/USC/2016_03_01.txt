Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath and Trojan Athletics Senate President Kamali Houston presented a proposal to create a Trojan Athlete Representative under USG’s advocacy’s branch at the USG Senate meeting Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Houston noted the lack of representation of athletes in the Senate and USG at large, despite the large number of student athletes on campus. USC has a large sports program; 21 varsity teams in total.
“It would be great to have an athlete representative here,” Houston said. “You have commuters and greek [senators], but there’s no athlete representation. It would be great to bridge that gap between athletes and the student body, because I don’t think that gap has been bridged.”
Sampath and Houston also recommended that USG create more positions to complement other constituencies within the community.
“The other ideas we had were to create a spring admit/transfer representative, as well as a disabilities services representative,” Sampath said.
The position would require the representative to work four unpaid hours in the USG office, serve as a liaison between the Trojan Athletics Senate and USG, develop relationships with university administration and launch new advocacy initiatives for the benefit of athletes.
Houston was quick to recognize the influence of student athletes and the benefit of supportive athletes. Houston briefly mentioned the University of Missouri football team boycott in November of last year, in which the players threatened to forfeit a game to protest racism on campus.
“I also want to point out that student athletes have a lot of power on this campus. I think it would beneficial for all students,” Houston said. “If we look at Mizzou and what they did there, I think having athletes behind you guys and a part of the whole student body would be really empowering.”
Sen. Darian Nourian asked about the process in which the position is appointed.
Houston elaborated on the application process, which would be open to all student athletes, but presented to Trojan Athletics Senate to jumpstart enthusiasm within the athlete community, as well as ensuring a dedicated USG representative.
“Rini and I have talked about it; we’ve talked about an application process,” Houston said. “For my end, I’m not going to have someone come here and waste your time. And we have the Trojan Athletics executive board, who are very consistent.”
Sampath further explained the process, comparing the process to most positions currently held within USG.
“We encourage a pool of applicants from Trojan Athletics Senate just for encouragement,” Sampath said. “But it would be to any student athlete on this campus, just as the rest of our applications are open to any student at large.”
Houston and Sampath spoke further after the presentation. Houston elaborated on the discrepancy between athletes’ and non-athletes’ experience at college.
“First and foremost, there is a divide between student athletes and the normal student body,” Houston said. “We don’t usually know what’s going on within the student body and vice versa, so it’s hard to bridge that gap.”

Students gathered Tuesday evening at Tommy’s Place to watch the results from Super Tuesday and participate in a discussion hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Political Student Assembly.
The event was the last one scheduled in the Unruh Institute’s Election 2016 series, which consisted of viewings and discussions of Republican and Democratic primary debates.
Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Anshu Siripurapu, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, moderated a panel featuring Tony Strickland, former California State Senator (R-37); John A. Pérez, speaker emeritus of the California State Assembly; Mary Perez, a member of the USC College Republicans and Nick Germain, president of the USC College Democrats.
The panelists discussed the results of Super Tuesday, where a dozen states and one territory cast their votes for their preferred presidential candidates.
At the start of the panel, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had already won the primaries in Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia and Georgia by a large margin. Clinton’s fellow Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders had won his home state of Vermont. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had won four primaries in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts and Tennessee.
Similar to most news broadcasts, Donald Trump’s candidacy dominated the first 10 minutes of the conversation.
“I think the key is to look at the hard votes for the Republican candidates,” Strickland said. “So far, up until this day, when you look at South Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire and Iowa, [the candidates] have had record turnouts.”
For Strickland, Trump’s success was unpredictable.
“If I was a Democrat, I’d be very concerned … I do think Donald Trump has brought in new people into the voting process. A lot of people early on said, ‘these people will come to rallies but they won’t turn out to vote,’” Strickland said. “I think a lot of people in the Republican party underestimated the strength of his brand.”
Mary Perez agreed with Senator Strickland.
“Trump has brought in [new] voters, and you just see this excitement in a huge demographic of voters to get involved with the political process, which is something that I, as a millennial, have not seen before,” Mary Perez said.
While on the topic of Trump, Schnur asked John Pérez his thoughts on the candidate.
“I’m scared that Donald Trump is a potential president,” said John Pérez. “It has been very interesting to watch the ability of the Trump campaign to not only inspire people to go to rallies but to actually turn out and vote.”
John Pérez contrasted Trump and Sanders, both of whom are considered outsider candidates.
“This is in sharp contrast between the experience on the Trump side, and the experience on the Democratic side with Sanders,” said John Pérez. “Both are having huge turnouts at rallies, but on the Republican side, you see that converting into actual election day participation. It is less clear how the Sanders campaign is getting folks who participate in rallies to actually participate in [the] election.”
Germain evaluated Sanders’ chances in the primary elections.
“I think [Sanders] has to do two things tonight: He has to win four or five states that are favorable to him … and avoid South Carolina-like margins in the South, and [according to] early reports, it seems he is getting completely blown out in Alabama and Georgia,” Germain said.
The panelists agreed that, so far, the 2016 election has been unlike any other. Depending on the state of the primaries after spring break, the Unruh Institute may hold additional events.

Wednesday the struggling Trojans will try to turn their season around after losing five of their last six games. Their opponent will be the Oregon State Beavers — a team they lost to 85-70 when they played in Corvallis.
In their first meeting with the Trojans, the Beavers came back after initially being down by 4 points at halftime to win by 15 points.
Despite holding the Beavers to just 3-for-18 from deep, their 47 percent 2-point shooting percentage helped bolster an early Pac-12 upset. Thanks to Oregon State’s Gary Payton II and his 22 points and 15 rebounds, the Beavers were virtually unstoppable in the second half.
Redshirt junior guard Katin Reinhardt, junior guard Julian Jacobs and sophomore guard Elijah Stewart were explosive on offense, combining for 40 points, 10 assists and 15 rebounds off of 14-for-29 shooting, including five 3-pointers.
Unfortunately, like their most recent game against Stanford, McLaughlin and Boatwright were held to just 3-for-16 overall, missing 10 of their 11 3-point attempts. Coming back to Galen Center, the Trojans’ 3-point prowess could perhaps re-establish itself after a slump.
Where USC has been hurting the most has been on the defensive side of the ball but one of the team’s best defenders redshirt junior forward Darion Clark is set to be back against OSU.
Jacobs emphasized the importance of playing defense after practice Monday. USC’s last two games resulted in 20-point-plus losses.
“I can’t stress enough how important that is for this team because when we play defense, that opens up so much more for us offensively,” Jacobs said. “We like to get out in transition, that’s the type of team we are, but when we don’t play defense, it’s kind of hard to attack a team that’s waiting for you.”
Head coach Andy Enfield stated that Clark’s injury is “day-to-day.” In practice, however, Clark stated that he was he was feeling very good thanks to a synthetic sleeve over his shoulder and upper forearm.
Where Clark’s presence will be needed is on the defensive zone against Oregon State’s 6-foot-3 guard Gary Payton II who leads the team with 15.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game including seven straight games scoring in double figures to go along with 11 games of 19 or more.
Payton, along with scorers Tres Tinkle and Stephen Thompson Jr., should be a handful for USC considering they combined for 51 of the Beavers’ 85 points.
As always, though, crowd support from the Trojans home fans could give USC the edge in a conference which is characterized by tough arenas.
“As we know as well as they know, it’s a very important game for us to hopefully come out with a victory,” Reinhardt said. “We’re just looking forward to this crowd to come out and helping us win this game. Everybody needs to be there. We’ve been pounding it out all year and the fans have been great for us.”
The 19-10 Trojans and 17-10 Beavers are set to tip off at 8 p.m. on Wednesday at the Galen Center.

Football season is nowhere to be found and men’s basketball has their final two home games this week before heading to Las Vegas for the Pac-12 tournament and hopefully a more fruitful postseason than some in recent memory. So as USC sports fans it may seem like the dog days where nothing exciting is going on, but on the contrary — USC is at the pinnacle of athletic achievement in sports around campus and that is something to celebrate and behold.
USC currently boasts three sports that hold No. 1 overall rankings: women’s water polo, women’s golf and women’s beach volleyball. Right behind them is No. 6 men’s golf. Women’s lacrosse is holding down the No. 11 ranking and men’s tennis is No. 12 in the country. Baseball, arguably spring’s most popular sport, is also going strong with a No. 22 national ranking.
These sports may not be as popular or glamorous as football or basketball, but they are clearly more successful than either program has been recently.
The slew of spring sports that are in the hunt for conference and national titles is something special; something that other schools can’t say they have.
The No. 4 women’s swim and dive team just captured the first conference championship in program history and the No. 9 men’s team is looking to defend their title from last year this week.
The other aquatic sport currently dominating the pool is women’s water polo. The Women of Troy are undefeated through 11 games and last weekend alone took down four top-25 opponents, including three top-10 opponents, one of them being No. 2 UCLA. I don’t know what it would take for people to get out and support this team, but I can say having never watched water polo before this year, it is certainly worth it. Water polo is intense, physical and relatively high scoring. For those who think it is boring or that they wouldn’t understand it, I say give it a chance. It is a game that is very easy to understand as a spectator and to watch it here at USC would be to watch the best collegiate water polo in the country.
Beach volleyball is another underappreciated sport. The athletic ability of these women who are running, leaping and diving through sand is incredible. The Women of Troy are the defending national champions coming off a remarkable 28-0 season. In addition to boasting the team national title, USC also brought home the individual title courtesy of juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes. The pair is the third consecutive Trojan duo to win the national title and will be defending their claim this season.
Women’s golf is another underappreciated sport that is equally as talented. Perhaps a bit harder to follow — since one of the few things USC does not boast on its campus is a golf course — but worthy of attention nonetheless, the top team in the land took home the title of the Gold Rush last week. The Trojans also swept the podium with freshman Robyn Lee winning, followed by sophomore Amy Lee in second and junior Tiffany Chan who finished third.
The men’s golf team is showing its perennial talent boasting a No. 6 ranking. Golf isn’t a spectator-friendly sport for the average college student but following along is certainly worthwhile as they continue competing in national tournaments.
Lacrosse is an up-and-coming sport at USC, starting their fourth season. The Women of Troy have proven themselves this season after upsetting then-No. 5 ranked Duke and have now vaulted in the rankings themselves sitting just outside the top-10 at No. 11. I believe that lacrosse will catch on among the student body and that this may be the hot spring sport to go watch because of the combination of talent and constant action.
Men’s tennis is an annual top talent and this year is no different. The Men of Troy are ranked No. 12 and the only three losses they have suffered this year have come at the hands of top-10 opponents. This is yet another squad that has championship caliber goals and boasts the talent to reach them.
Baseball is spring’s darling and the team came into the season with high hopes after narrowly missing the College World Series last year. The team surprised everyone with their success and this year expectations are high. It has been a bit of a rocky road for the Trojans on the diamond, but they maintain a high ranking at No. 22. The team has a huge weekend leading up to playing No. 14 UCLA in Dodger Stadium for the Stadium Classic.
The sports in season right now are talented and dominant, and all have legitimate championship hopes.
So here’s to celebrating the underdogs of USC athletics. For the sports whose stars blend in on Trousdale and aren’t asked for autographs after they play, but for putting in the time and effort to bring the Trojan Family pride and entertainment every day.

Less than a week after the USC women’s swimming and diving team captured its first conference championship in more than three decades, the men’s team will have their turn to begin a run at a Pac-12 title of their own.
The No. 9 Trojans come into the Pac-12 Championships with a 9-1 record on the season, and they’ve won four of their five Pac-12 meets — including a sweep of second-ranked Cal and No. 11 Stanford. The last time the Trojans beat both of their Bay Area rivals in the same season was 1997.
Trojan swimmers will have to face off against swimmers from these top-ranked teams once again and they will also be taking on No. 20 Arizona State and Utah — two teams USC has already beaten this season. Five of the six teams competing in the conference championships are ranked in the nation’s top-25, and the Trojans’ path to defending last year’s Pac-12 title will not be an easy one.
“Cal, Stanford and Arizona are all very competitive teams that will be making an impact at the NCAA Championships later in March,” head coach Dave Salo said. Salo led USC to their first conference championship since 1979 last year.
“Winning the Pac-12 Championships gives the team just a little more confidence that we are one of the top teams in the country,” Salo said.
The Trojans are off to a good start in the conference championships, even before the swimmers hit the lanes. The Pac-12 men’s diving championships took place last week, concurrently with the women’s conference championships. USC boasted strong individual performances from sophomore Dashiell Enos and senior Collin Pollard. Enos finished first in the three-meter with a score of 419.35, and Pollard, competing in his final postseason for the Trojans, won the platform event with a score of 427.7 to go along with his second-place finish in the one-meter. USC is currently tied with Stanford atop the leaderboard, and both schools lead third-place Cal by nearly 100 points.
“I am so thrilled with my overall performance this weekend,” Pollard said after the meet. “I stayed consistent and really tried my best to perform up to my abilities not only on platform but on one-meter as well.”
When the swimmers get started Wednesday, the Trojans will have plenty of individuals to showcase as well.
Junior Steven Stumph won the 200-yard breast championship at last year’s Pac-12 meet, and fellow junior Reed Malone will look to improve upon his success at last year’s Pac-12s, where he finished second in the 500-yard freestyle.
Malone is one of three Trojan captains, and all of them will need to be at their best in order for USC to win the title. Seniors Morten Klarskov and Ted Singley have been keystone performers for the Trojans this season, and both will be competing in their final conference championships.
“We are relying on our captains to step up and lead the way with their performances,” Salo said. “Now we need them to score big against our main rivals.”
As important as veteran leadership is to a team’s success, the Trojans will also have to rely on some swimmers with no collegiate postseason experience. Freshmen Carsten Vissering, Patrick Mulcare and Alex Valente will all swim in individual events at the meet, and other freshmen are expected to make contributions to relay events.
The events that make up the Pac-12 Championships will begin on Wednesday and will continue until Saturday, when the champion will be crowned. All events will take place at Weyerhauser King County Aquatic Center in Federal Way, Washington, and the final three days of the meet will be televised on the Pac-12 Network.

The No. 12 USC men’s tennis team fell to No. 6 UCLA 5-2 on Tuesday in a non-conference crosstown showdown in Westwood.
This was USC’s first outdoor loss in the season, as the previous two both came in the ITA Indoor Championships.
The Bruins clinched the match after a three-set win on court 4 by senior Karue Sell over freshman Jake DeVine. 
The match started off tight at doubles. On court 2, UCLA duo Karue Sell and Joseph Di Giulio battled to beat freshman Jack Jaede and senior Max de Vroome 6-2 after pulling out a 4-0 streak. On court 1, junior Nick Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven were able to upset the third team in the nation, Mackenzie McDonald and Martin Redlicki, with a 6-4 win. The Trojans were up 4-1 before the Bruins tied back at 4-all. After holding serve, UCLA saved two match points, bringing it to the deciding point. There, Crystal was able to use his experience and, with a backhand winner, tied the doubles score. 
It was all left to court 3, where UCLA’s Maxime Cressy and Gage Brymer were up a break and serving for the match against freshman Jake DeVine and junior Rob Bellamy. At 5-4 and 30-all, the Bruins pulled out a great defensive point that forced the Trojans into an unforced error, before a return error by DeVine awarded the doubles point to UCLA.
At singles, the situation didn’t change. On court 6, Jaede couldn’t do much against Di Giulio, who gave the Bruins the second point thanks to his 6-1, 6-1 win. On court 1, No. 65 de Vroome lost the first set 6-2 to No.19 McDonald. After a close start with no break in the second set, the Bruins managed to win the second set 6-4, giving the third point to UCLA, which was just one point away from winning the match. 
Meanwhile, all the other matches were close. On court 2, No. 67 Nick Crystal managed to win the first set against No.36 Redlicki in a close tie-break that ended 7-5 for the Trojans, who battled back from 4-2 to secure the first set. No. 56 Logan Smith faltered in the ninth game by No. 46 Brymer  and was not able to break back, losing the first set 6-4. No. 92 DeVine lost the first set 6-4 to No. 94 Sell, while on court 5, Thibault Forget seemed to had an easy win in his belt, but Logan Staggs was able to come back after being down 1-6, 0-4, tying the second set at 4-4. Both players held serve and the game was tied at 5 all. There the Frenchman was able to hold serve and break his opponent, closing the set 6-1, 7-5, putting the Trojans in the scoreboard.
I got a little bit nervous and [Staggs] played a little better going into rallies,” Forget said. “I was not able to keep on going and finishing the point early. When we went to 6-5, I had good energy to reproduce what I did in the first set.”
On court 2, Crystal managed to win the second set 6-2, closing the gap in the score. It was all left up to courts 3 and 4, with the Trojans called to win both courts to complete what would have been an amazing comeback. With all the eyes of the crowd toward court 4, where USC had won the second set 6-4, home favorite Sell was able to play his experience against DeVine, clinching the match with the score of 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. On court 3, the match went on, and it ended with a win by UCLA with the score of 4-6, 6-2, 6-7(8).
“It’s always a battle between us,” Crystal said. “A takeaway is that we can compete with them. It’s the first time for a lot of freshmen playing UCLA. It’s good to see the environment. They were always battling and it was a close match all the way through.”
USC is now 7-3 overall and the team is now heading to the Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament on Thursday.

The USC Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena opened Royal Taste on Friday, a new touring exhibition focusing on the court artwork and material culture of 15th- and 16th- century China. The exhibit makes an enjoyable visit for students interested in Ming dynasty art and the aesthetic fashions that emerged and traveled throughout Asia prior to Western intervention.
Royal Taste includes diverse types of artwork, ranging from jewelry and paintings to functional items like ceramics and clothing. Many of the pieces displayed are on loan from the Hubei Provincial Museum, with this marking their first showing in the United States. The majority of these are recent excavations from the tomb of Prince Zhuang and Empress Wei of Liang, which was discovered in 2001.
The first room, a jewelry gallery, humanizes the royal figures by showcasing fashion trends that intersect their personal taste with religious and cultural trends. Auspicious “lotus-carrying bulky boys” — plump, rambunctious babies that celebrate fertility — constituted an enduring theme in the adornments of Chinese officials. Several are to be found in Royal Taste. After the jewelry room stands a small passageway with royal symbols of authority, including an iron sword and helmet, rare adornments for a prince during a period where it was politically hazardous for civilian officials to don military attire.
A gallery of paintings follows, which captures well the competing artistic philosophies during the Ming era, the zhe style of conservative academic painting and the wu style, more expressive and interpretive. Especially striking are two large scroll paintings that take up the entire wall, similar in content: “Fishing Boat on the River in Spring” and “Fishing on a Snowy River,” both depictions of fishermen in what appears to be the wu style, capture the scholar-artists’ wistful affection for the simplicity of a fisherman’s life. Viewers are invited to identity with the painters’ yearning for mundanity and escape.
Several pieces on loan from the Wudang Mountain Museum, named for the mountain in Daoism and the birthplace of international martial arts, suggest a more functional role for art in this period. These statues of intimidating martial figures represent characters from the Daoist “divine bureaucracy.” Supplications were traditionally made to each one for the suppression of demons or alleviation of drought. These pieces contrast with the many Buddha and bodhisattva statues found throughout the exhibit, whose posture is visibly more introspective. Strolling among these statues offers visitors a glimpse of the multiplicity of religious traditions active during the Ming period, an experience akin to walking through modern Los Angeles.
Viewers will be impressed by the cosmopolitan nature of the exhibit. Rather than presenting disparate artworks of compartmentalized Pacific-Asian cultures, the Royal Taste exhibit, as well as the USC Pacific Asia Museum as a whole, presents a portrait of a premodern Asia that was richly interconnected, in constant dialogue about artistic fashions and techniques. The jewelry in his collection shows a fascination with foreign cultures, including hairpieces reminiscent of paisley teardrops.
The abundance of Pacific-Asian cultures is also on display in the opening gallery, a smattering of rotating works from the museum’s collections. Beautiful depictions of Shinto deities from Japan that recall Eastern Orthodox icons, currently on display, are explained as a response to the arrival of Buddhism — and its concordant iconography — in Japan in the late-16th century. Prior to that, direct depictions of Shinto deities were considered taboo, and Japanese artists instead used abstract, symbolic gestures.
Also a must-see in the general exhibit is Korean modernist Park Soo-Keun’s “Homeward Bound,” a richly textured painting that suggests both the irretrievable losses of the Korean War and the imperative of optimism in the wake of national tragedy. The museum acquired the painting last fall.
For USC students, staff, and faculty, Royal Taste is $8; general admission to the permanent galleries is free. The museum is a short walk from the Memorial Park station of the Metro Gold Line.

If anyone asks Rhea Tepp, co-founder and organizer of the L.A. Zine Fest, an annual showcase for hundreds of independently published writers, artists and illustrators, there’s a lot more to a zine than words and pictures.
“Often when you ask someone what a zine is, and they don’t know, that immediately launches you into a really interesting conversation,” Tepp said. “Technically, [a zine is] a handmade, often cheaply-produced publication about anything you want. The object itself is an act of self-expression, but what surrounds that is a community that’s going to support those who have voices that exist outside of the mainstream.”
This Sunday will be the L.A. Zine Fest’s fifth year open to the public, featuring, in addition to tables of zinesters, hands-on workshops hosted by students at Otis College of Art and Design and several panel discussions and readings taking place in four locations within two blocks of The Majestic Downtown.
In addition, Tepp stated that planning the event is a bit like planning a wedding.
“We joke that we’re like these really weird wedding planners because of all the things we’ve had to learn how to organize,” Tepp said. “We use programs for wedding planners, and we definitely aren’t them, but I love being able to create this incredible event where everyone thinks it’s the most special day of the year.”
For many participants in the event, like illustrator Ellen Marie Bae, L.A. Zine Fest is a very special day.
“There’s definitely a lot of excitement in the air just being surrounded by so many creative and passionate people who are all there for the same reason,” Bae said. “As an attendee, the tangible aspect of being able to pick up a zine, read and fall in love with it is the best part. As a tabler, I love meeting and sharing my work with people. It’s all very rewarding and humbling at the same time.”
Bae said that among the many things that inspire her — including Javier Bardem’s nose, vintage ad posters and burritos — the event is huge. Her work, like a fanzine about Ricky from Trailer Park Boys and a project called “Telephone Zine” will be on display at the Fest, the latter being a huge collaborative project based off the games Telephone and Pictionary with 30 contributors.
For Third Press’ Jess Castillo, an L.A.-based multimedia artist, the Fest is a way of sharing her experimentation with tactility and interactivity in print. Her work focuses on personal narratives, which means she looks at family histories that have experienced diaspora, analyzes how their identities move forward and then translates into zines.
“I write about family histories, cultural histories, identity, agriculture and the way in which we understand and claim our spaces,” Castillo said.
An L.A. native, Castillo was raised in a dual relationship between what her family was bringing from Mexico, which was focused on understanding agriculture, and what she was experiencing in the city, where grocery stores are on every corner.
“That’s where all the ideas are coming from, and I make things that get closer and closer to expressing that,” Castillo said. “I’m so excited to go see the zine community and bond together over the weird ideas and things we make.”
At the fest, Castillo will be promoting her new “Learning to Love Myself” zine series and looking for women of color collaborators to help with the series.
Collaboration is huge in the zine community, with entire businesses like the L.A.-based Plots by Clots, a group of creatives that work on zines together, coming out to attend the festival.
“We’re a collaborative group of about a dozen people with all different types of backgrounds,” said Stephanie Kuga, co-founder of Plots by Clots. “We’re writers, designers, animators. We have a couple of engineers who work at SpaceX. It’s really fun.”
The group takes zines and expands them to more than their print medium, getting together weekly to create stories in written form, as well as in video, short film and photography.
“We’re really just all about different kinds of storytelling and experimenting and exploring different mediums,” Kuga said. “[At the Fest], we’ll have five issues of print magazines, and we’ve created officially two short films. We’re hoping to have some sort of video loop and screen so we can talk about them.”
Selfish, a mostly-memoir magazine run by women and featuring female-identified artists and writers, is another major collaborative effort.
“We work in memoir, but as an experimental publication, we enjoy playing around with the fluidity of truth through different mediums,” said Taylor Yates, editor-in-chief. “We’ve published video stills, comics, cross-stitch — anything that can be printed on page, we want to work with.”
Yates said to be on the lookout for their third issue, “Good Girl,” at the Zine Fest.
In addition to the above-mentioned exhibits, there will be hundreds of other tables showcasing the works of creators like Dave Van Patten, who uses dark humor and absurdism in his new zine called “Psychedelic Elevator Music”; Michele Rosenthal, a freelance illustrator and graphic designer whose latest two comics feature alien astronauts and the electronic band Kraftwerk; Juan Carlos Beaz, who runs the self-publishing outlet Transitory Existence and will be releasing a coloring zine; Amy Burek, whose zines that she categorizes as “internet humor” act as a tiny shrine to the wonders, horrors and absurdities of the internet (look out for her new zine, “Lists of Lists of Lists of Wikipedia,” at the Fest); and Wasted Ink Zine Distro’s Marna Kay and Charissa Lucille, who will be promoting their own effort at a zine festival in Phoenix, Arizona.
Several small presses will be in attendance, too, like the Pioneers Press — a publishing house and small-press distro focused on gender, sexuality, social justice and literary works by up-and-coming authors — that will be promoting Adam Gnade’s book Locust House: A Novella, about “love and death and wildness and catharsis.”
The Vice Versa Press, a traveling press that works with letters, screen printing and photocopy printing processes, will also be there showcasing owner Julia Arredondo’s cultural satire zines like “Guide To Dating Gangsters Vol. 1 and 2” and relationship-based material like “Baltimore Breakups: A Pop-Up Memoir.”
As for other artists to look out for, Johnny Herber, also known as Lobster Johnny, is newer to the zine scene.
“When I started making [zines], at the time, I was really interested in philosophy and shoju manga and different aspects of religion and culture,” Herber said. “My book Escargoteric relates a little to Native American culture — the religious aspects. [It’s] a snail-heavy fantasy comic.”
Herber said he will be doing free drawings for those who stop by his table and will also have the original pages of a new books he’s working on about a guy who looks like a troll doll and suffers from social anxiety.
Vivian Shih, an illustrator and surface designer who makes zines about how people feel about the places they live and, more recently, about rural homes all across the world, says coming to any zine festival is an incredible experience.
“Zine Fest is a place where everyone can enjoy something if they’re into anything creative,” Shih said. “The writing, the photography, the art — it’s a great way to explore everything.”
L.A. Zine Fest will be open to the public between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday.

There’s a city in northern New Mexico called Chimayo that I visit everytime I’m home. It’s a spiritual site — one of many in The Land of Enchantment — with a sprawling hodgepodge of accumulated infrastructure to accommodate a small well of supposedly holy sand. Imagine: a city built entirely around a circle of dirt roughly 18 inches in diameter.
The history of the site is complicated, and steeped in Spanish colonialism, but its uses today are much simpler. People come to leave things -— pictures, memorabilia, birth announcements, funerary memorials, baby shoes, crutches and old toys. They sit with these things and think about them, reminisce, with some of them praying, but the point is to come to terms with whatever you bring. People come to Chimayo to give thanks for everything, good and bad, and move forward a more complete person, unencumbered by the past.
I know it sounds lofty and kind of new-agey, but I think that kind of opportunity is sorely lacking in general walks of life — the time, space and occasion for closure. We carry these things around with us, unable to leave them behind, and the hurt fades but it also comes back sometimes, at unexpected and often inopportune junctures. I write a romance column, I of all people should know.
But alas, we can’t all make a pilgrimage to tiny towns full of spiritual significance, nor is it necessarily all of our styles to do so. Some, myself included, like to keep drawers full of the past, and boxes and bags of it in the back of closets. An ex’s old shirt we said we lost but we just wanted to keep sleeping in, concert tickets, burned CDs, heartfelt notes, goofy drawings. It doesn’t even have to be romantic. Hell, it could be a brimmed beanie that defined your seventh grade experience, a handprint painting you made with an ailing parent, a family picture from before the divorce, a birthday present from your first grade best friend. These things don’t hold any current relevance, but they hold a piece of you — not unlike a horcrux for you Harry Potter fans, something you’re not quite ready to separate from. So you keep it buried rather than throwing it out, forgotten somewhere in storage, to spark a journey through the past when you come upon it again.
Last week, I wrote about finding a stack of postcards from a high school crush. They brought up a sudden rush of memories that I had otherwise completely forgotten, but more than anything, they bummed me out. I was such a strange adolescent who became a strange semi-adult, and all the confidence I had in that strangeness evaporated in the time it took to say a first name. But all that is behind me, and I’ve grown so much since then, romantically and otherwise. My total loss of memory from that time should have clued me into that. Why spend valuable time and energy feeling bad about who I was and what I did God knows how many years ago when it clearly has no bearing on my present?
It’s not to say there’s anything wrong with reminiscing once in a while — you might even learn something about yourself, add some depth to your understanding of how you got to this point. But there are also times when it’s better to lay those memories, those past selves, those talismans to rest. It’s time for me to move on and I would like to invite you, dear readers, to join me.
I hereby invite you to a recurring event of collective catharsis – or rather, CARTharsis. That’s right. You don’t have to go to Chimayo — Chimayo is coming to you. I am constructing a mobile shrine that I’ll install in various places on campus throughout March and April. It’s a memorial for your sacred items, somewhere safe to leave them so you can move forward a freer person. Just imagine if your favorite food truck served up a steaming dose of closure with your comfort food.
Don’t worry, I’ll keep you updated on where the shrine will be and when so you too can plan your mini pilgrimages. The Facebook event page is live — just search for CARTharsis or message me for a link. My information is on the invite, so please feel free to contact me whenever you want with any and all questions, concerns and comments. I’m here for you. This campus is full of complicated, interesting individuals who have lived a lot. Come to terms with it, and do it in an environment of supportive fellow closure-seekers.

The No. 22 USC baseball team capitalized off of a 5-run second inning to defeat Long Beach State 7-4 Tuesday night in the teams’ one game meeting at Blair Field to improve to 5-3. 
The USC rally, highlighted by a two-run Adalberto Carrillo home run, scoring A.J. Ramirez, was a response to a quick 3-run first inning by the 49ers. 
Freshman pitcher CJ Stubbs was roughed up in his second collegiate outing for the Trojans, pitching only three innings and allowing 4 runs on three hits. After hitting Long Beach State’s Brock Lundquist with a pitch in the first inning, advancing base runners to second and third, first baseman Dillon Paulson committed an error that allowed Duran to score. Then, Long Beach outfielder Tristan Mercadel doubled down the right field line, scoring two more, while advancing to third base. 
Long Beach infielder Zack Domingues scored an unearned run off a Jarren Duran ground out to USC shortstop Regggie Southall in the bottom of the second, following a fruitful 5-run top of the inning for the Trojans. The Trojans added runs in the fifth and ninth innings to further extend the lead. In the fifth inning, David Oppenheim reached base on an error by Duran, scoring Carrillo, unearned. In the ninth, Lars Nootbaar scored as a result of a wild pitch from Long Beach Junior Kyle Brown. 
The win was given to USC pitcher Mason Perryman, who went three innings, allowing three runs and no runs.
The Trojans, who recently received their first series win of the season against Wake Forest last weekend, will hope to ride their momentum heading into the Dodgers Stadium Classic Friday.

Last year, there were nearly 43,000 vacancies for teaching positions in California. With a push to return class sizes to smaller, pre-recession sizes, California needs to hire 60,000 new teachers, according to the Washington Post. However, according to Senate Education Committee Chairwoman Carol Liu, the last decade has shown a 75 percent decline of young people pursuing careers in the field of education. As a result, districts have been forced to hire underqualified teachers in an attempt to combat the teacher shortage, which further harms students’ education. This gap is perpetuated by the decision of many recent college graduates to forgo teaching due to a lack of incentives for a career in education and stigma surrounding teaching. To close this gap, California should reinstate a student loan forgiveness program and provide more guidance for future teachers to learn about the requirements of the career in order to incentivize a career in education.
One of the largest setbacks of teaching is the massive student debt graduates amass after receiving teaching credentials. With teaching certificate programs ranging anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000, and undergraduate degrees at in-state universities costing an average of $20,000, graduates looking to become teachers are faced with an upwards of at least $40,000 in debt. Given that the average starting teacher salary is $45,637, it takes the average teacher 21 years to earn back the cost of their college education. One way to create fewer barriers for recent college graduates to enter into the field of teaching would be to create student loan forgiveness programs. One piece of proposed legislation, Senate Bill 1264 by State Sen. Fran Pavley, would bring back a student loan forgiveness program that was eliminated during the recession. This program would require teachers to spend at least four years in a school with a large proportion of disadvantaged students or in a rural school with lots of staff vacancies. This legislation would not only help recruit college graduates into the teaching profession, but would also encourage experienced teachers to seek master’s degrees, National Board Certification or additional credentials. Student loan forgiveness gives more recent graduates incentives to pursue a career in teaching.
Additionally, even after a college graduate has decided to become a teacher, he or she must jump through several hoops. To apply for teaching credential programs, graduates must pass the California Basic Skills Education Test and California Subject Examinations for Teachers and, depending on the university, may have to take the general graduate student entrance exam, the GRE, as well. Through the credential programs, students apply for a five-year preliminary credential, which becomes a Clear Credential only after students apply for National Board Certification, among other options. Only then are students considered full-fledged teachers, even though they may have been teaching for multiple years. The various processes required to become teachers in California hold educators to a higher standard, which is beneficial because it supplies the state with well-prepared teachers. However, for a recent college graduate without mentors or knowledge of how to become a teacher, the process can be rather daunting.
One program that would greatly benefit recent graduates, proposed in SB 915 by Liu, would reestablish a previously cut entity that served as a one-stop shop for potential teachers. This program provides information about credential requirements and job opportunities to aspiring teachers and helps schools looking to recruit new teachers. To help provide future teachers with mentors to learn more about the career and witness life in the classroom, the state government also needs to create a program to pair new teachers with veteran ones. A similar program proposed in SB 933 by State Sen. Ben Allen would create a teacher residency program, which would allow new teachers to complete classroom instruction under the mentorship of a veteran teacher for up to three years while studying for their credential.
California needs to make major changes in order to supply the state with much-needed new teachers — to start, the state must implement student loan forgiveness programs to help teacher with college debt and create new programs to assist teachers with the rigorous process of receiving credentials.

Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., recently announced that starting Fall 2016, 8 a.m. classes will no longer exist. Instead, the university is instituting a “common hour” program to allow students and faculty the availability to participate in university assemblies and activities. Though this change has predominantly been proposed to encourage university involvement, the banning of 8 a.m. classes can also have significant effects on the overall well-being and quality of life of students. Supported by various sleep studies, an increase in hours of sleep can optimize university experience, especially with regard to maximizing academic potential. USC should follow Lake Superior State University’s lead in adopting this policy to improve the environment for students and faculty alike.
The program at this Michigan university was proposed to increase student and faculty participation in school activities and forums relating to university matters, as well as to the obvious benefit of relieving students and professors from tedious early classes. At USC, students and faculty could benefit from a later schedule. Many aspects of college life are inevitably later in the evenings. Most on-campus organizations at USC, for instance, schedule their weekly meetings at night, rendering it difficult to allot enough time for sleep, studying and participating in extracurricular activities.
Sleep scientists are now advocating for secondary schools to begin classes at 10 a.m. and universities at 11 a.m., arguing that shifting the school day later has, if anything, no potential downside, while earlier classes have been proven to negatively affect a student’s overall well-being. Further studies have supported the notion that later classes will help curb the probability of developing health issues, depression and a decline in academic performance. Normal sleep involves circadian rhythms and homeostatic sleep drive. Scientists contend that adolescents are biologically predisposed to sleep later due to delayed circadian cycles. Thus, sleep hours are shifted to later in the night. Students go to sleep at later hours, meaning that early classes can contribute to sleep deprivation, indicating an average sleep time below the recommended nine hours. Irregular sleep cycles affect concentration and learning. Moreover, early morning classes lead students to rush to arrive on time, which often results in breakfast being neglected and leaves no time for the brain to awaken and prepare itself to absorb information. Students with their heads on their desks and their eyes closed are not digesting the information being taught.
Given the consequences of early morning classes and the potential for greater involvement given a late start schedule, USC should seriously consider changing its class itinerary. Eliminating 8 a.m. classes will not only benefit student and faculty involvement in university matters, but it will also improve student health. It is time for the administration to reconsider the long-standing, institutionalized early morning classes and ban the 8 a.m.
There is no way this is not a prank article. How in the world is 8 am considered an unreasonable hour to be in class? It seems every year, young adults are creating an artificial universe filled with safe spaces and brunch time wake up calls. 
“Students with their heads on their desks and their eyes closed are not digesting the information being taught.” — To this I say – man up and pick your head up off the desk. Once your mommy and daddy stops paying over $50K a year for your educational, experience, you will realize you have to do a lot of things you do not want to do – once again – man up.
I say ban school on Mondays and Fridays.  Why let work get in the way of fun?
Last time I checked, the normal work is 08:00am  – 5:00pm. Get used to it and structure your classes, studying and the participation in “extra curricular activities” around that window. That’s life, kid.

The Pac-12 unveiled the conference’s women’s basketball All-Century team on Monday night with a starting group of eight guards, twelve centers, one player of the century and one coach of the century. USC came second in the group with five All-Century starters, including the All-Century Player of the Year.
Former Trojan forward Cheryl Miller was named All-Century Player of the Year. At USC, she took home two NCAA titles and was named NCAA Tournament MVP for both of those years. She was a four-time All-American and won the Naismith College Player of the Year three times. She is currently in the top ten in the NCAA records for career points with 3,018 points and career rebounds with 1,534 rebounds. She ended her career scoring a school record average of 22.3 points per game and also set school records in total field goals with 1,150 and total free throws with 700. Miller won gold in the Los Angeles Olympics with the 1984 team. She is now a coach at Langston University.
Four other Trojans besides Miller were named to the team as well. Current head coach Cynthia Cooper was the only USC guard to make the team. A Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, Cooper won a pair of NCAA championships, four WNBA titles and an Olympic gold medal before becoming a coach. Since joining the USC coaching program, she has helped to turn the team around.
Former forwards Lisa Leslie, Pam McGee and Tina Thompson were also named to the All-Century team. Leslie was a three-time WNBA Most Valuable Player of the Year with the Los Angeles Sparks and a four-time Olympic gold medalist. In 2015, she was also named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The second overall pick in the 1997 WNBA draft, McGee won Olympic gold in Los Angeles alongside Miller before playing around the world in Brazil, France, Italy and Spain.
The first draft pick in WNBA history, Thompson won four WNBA championships with the Houston Comets and two Olympic gold medals. She is the WNBA’s all-time leading scorer and in 2011 was voted as one of the top 15 players in WNBA history. These five players represent a century of women’s basketball excellence at USC, which Cooper hopes to continue this weekend as her current team heads to Seattle for the Pac-12 Tournament.

It’s standing room only in the lobby of our student apartment building. At 5 p.m. on a Monday, we’re all gathered around the flat screen TV watching the Academy Awards live. Thanks to the time difference, the only people watching the red carpet were the ones who didn’t have class at noon. No one really cares, though, because we’re all here for Leonardo DiCaprio.
When the presenter reaches his name, hoots and cheers erupt from the students gathered around the TV. Leo, you’ve got plenty of fans here in New Zealand.
In fact, in my three weeks abroad, I’ve learned that American celebrities are a special breed. They are truly world famous because of the size and scope of the U.S. media and entertainment industry. It’s already the largest entertainment industry in the world. By 2018, it’s expected to be valued at a whopping $723 billion, according to the U.S International Trade Administration.
I’ve heard about the revenue from the international box office, but it’s not until I was squeezed on the couch with a bunch of Kiwis rooting for Leo that I understood what that means exactly. It’s crazy that people who live on the other side of the world share my celebrity crush on Matt Damon and the Despicable Me minions. Ok, I made the latter one up. (I know everyone rolled their eyes when the little yellow guys made an appearance at the Oscars, but I still love them.)
It’s not just movies either. Kiwis know more about the Kardashian family and the U.S. presidential candidates than I do. Turn on the Top 40 radio station, and there’s a good chance that Justin Bieber is singing about saying sorry.
American entertainment dominates, and that’s the reality of living in a small market like New Zealand with its 4.5 million population. As a result, Kiwis are very familiar with American culture, American accents and American slang. On the other hand, I have a pretty steep learning curve. I sometimes struggle to understand the New Zealand accent, and I still can’t remember the name of the reality star from Geordie Shore (their version of Jersey Shore).
The Kiwis know Leo’s name though. DiCaprio’s name is announced for the Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the entire room starts celebrating.
As cool as it was to watch the biggest night for the movie industry in a foreign country and to be a part of the international Leo fan club, I couldn’t help but wish that the Kiwis had some of their own big movies and movie stars to root for. Local films are in such short supply that the New Zealand Film Awards, their version of the Oscars, are postponed at least six months while the organizers wait for a stronger mix of films.
My Kiwi roommates suggest that instead of waiting, we start my education in New Zealand entertainment with the New Zealand Bachelor television show. The new season starts in a week, and I know the lead won’t be as good as Leo, but I’ve got high hopes that the New Zealand bachelor is good looking and entertaining nonetheless.

USC alumni have done well in the Digital Age. From online dating with Tinder’s Sean Rad to cloud computing with Salesforce’s Marc Benioff to entertainment with Shonda Rhimes, there are Trojans leading the pack in a wide variety of modern industries. This year, Trojans are about to start being primed on the latest frontier: “FinTech,” also known as Financial Technology.
FinTech, as a phrase, encompasses quite a lot but generally refers to the segment of the technology startup scene that is disrupting banking, a field with components that hasn’t seen much change since the middle ages according to James Healy, vice president of FastPay. After Healy and Marc Hamud, senior vice president of GE Capital, approached the Marshall School of Business last summer about developing a course on the industry, they were given the green light and got to work on developing curriculum right away.
Starting on March 8, “The FinTech Revolution — Disrupting Traditional Finance” will begin meeting for three hours a week to cover topics including blockchain technology, the use of data and algorithms in emerging models of alternative lending and trends affecting wealth management services and other innovations in the field. Additionally, leading executives in FinTech will be visiting each class as guest speakers to share their thoughts on their business models and the industry’s future.

In a recent Accenture report, it was found that global investment in FinTech is on the rise, skyrocketing from $930 million in 2008 to over $12 billion by the start of 2015. Europe, in particular, saw a tremendous growth rate in 2014 of 215 percent that translated to $1.48 billion. Unsurprisingly, similar interest was seen on the USC campus with all 35 seats being filled in the first week of its addition to the course catalogue; there is also a growing waitlist for the course.
Although the course, which is the first of its kind to be offered at a major U.S. university, is only offered for credit to MBA students this year, Healy and Hamud have received numerous requests from students to participate in the guest speaker discussions and are opening them up to all USC students.  Students who are interested in hearing industry leaders discuss disrupting the traditional financial system can sign up on Eventbrite using the following links:
