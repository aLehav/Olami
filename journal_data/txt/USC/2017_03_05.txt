One of USC’s professors was recently on television, but it was not for a scientific discovery or for the release of a new book. USC’s wellness dog, Professor Beauregard Tirebiter, was shown on National Geographic Wild in the premiere episode of Dog Nation: City of Angels on Friday.
Professor Beau, as students call him, could be the only of his kind at any American university, according to USC News.
According to USC News, therapy dogs help students mitigate stress and create a sense of community at USC. The University made Beau a permanent part of the faculty last fall after receiving a positive reception from students about visiting therapy dogs.
When Beau first started his role as a professor at USC, he held office hours in the student wellness lounge of the Engemann Student Health Center. However, now Beau holds out-of-office hours Monday through Thursday. During these hours, Beau is found at different locations on campus, where students can pet and play with him.
Before being featured on Dog Nation, Beau appeared during a primetime section in the “Top 10 Plays” of ESPN’s SportsCenter and during the daytime news on ABC7. Host Cesar Millan’s show, Dog Nation, is about helping organizations across the United States by transforming dogs’ behavior. Millan’s son Andre Millan visited USC, where Amanda Vanni, a health promotions specialist and Beau’s caretaker at USC introduced him to Beau.
Beau’s popularity has increased even more with his appearance on Dog Nation. Jereme Barnett-Woods, a graduate student majoring in electrical engineering, watched the premiere of Dog Nation and was ecstatic to see Beau on it.
“I think [he] is a great addition to the campus,” Barnett-Woods said. “More schools should look into training a therapy dog as a full-time resource to the academic stresses of being a student.”
Harini Reddy Mali, a graduate student majoring in computer science,  was thrilled when she heard about Beau’s feature on Dog Nation and is interested in visiting Beau so that she can enjoy a moment of relaxation during her hectic schedule. According to Mali, Beau’s appearance on the show will encourage other schools to have therapy dogs to help students tackle academic pressure.
“It was such a different idea of having a professor who is a  dog to help students feel stress-free,” Mali said. “I am definitely going to visit him during his office hours because I love dogs, and I would love to spend some time with Beau. It will truly help me feel relaxed and less stressed about school.”

Paul Boulos and his team spent their Saturday morning sorting different types of bread — 20,000 pounds of it. 
Boulos, a freshman studying business administration volunteered at Marshall Community Service Day on Saturday with approximately 150 USC students, staff, alumni and faculty. Volunteers met at 7 a.m. to work at one of the nine community service sites, two of which were on campus, ranging from the L.A. Food Bank to the L.A. Ronald McDonald House. The event was hosted by the student-run Marshall Outreach and Volunteer Entrepreneurs organization, and was open to any USC-affiliated volunteers.
“Volunteering made me realize how lucky you are,” Boulos said. “It makes you feel really good … it clears your mind.”
The event provided volunteers with breakfast and lunch on the Marshall Lawn. Vice Dean for Undergraduate Programs Tyrone Callahan gave a speech in the morning to thank volunteers for their service.
Lindsay Sotnick, a junior studying business administration, is the current president of MOVE and has volunteered with the organization since she was a freshman. This year, she worked at the World Harvest Food Bank, a food bank only two blocks from USC’s campus.
“As college students, we tend to think of ourselves as so busy,” Sotnick said. “Noticing that you have the time to give back, even if it’s just for a few hours on a Saturday morning once a semester, is important to recognize I’m not having the biggest problem that’s out there.”
Ximena Araujo, a junior studying business and accounting, is the vice president of MOVE and has found that joining a service organization has helped her continue to volunteer. She stayed on campus during MCSD to manage the food and coordinate transportation for volunteers.
“There’s so much controversy about the top 1 percent, and the business leaders who have all this power, and the people at Marshall are the future business leaders,” Araujo said. “It’s really important for Marshall to be involved in teaching our students that they have to give back.”
Sowon Kang is the assistant director for international programs for Marshall undergraduates and the former student services coordinator. She works to connect student organizations to available administrative resources. She credits MOVE with the event organization, but provided administrative support and coordination.
“This gets people more engaged, and it is eye-opening to see how they can contribute to local communities, which is a great experience for students to have,” Kang said. “They can understand how to give back to the community which is not as fortunate as they are.”

Residents of Cardinal Gardens Apartments are using their green thumbs to contribute to sustainability efforts with a new community garden. 
The 250-square-foot garden opened Saturday and is located on a lawn at Cardinal Gardens. The initiative is a joint effort between the USC Environmental Student Assembly, USC Environmental Core and the residents, and aims to help students grow their own vegetables in their backyard. 
Residential student and staff volunteers, working closely with Cardinal Gardens Resident Assistant Olivia Pearson, built a vegetation patch surrounded by a sturdy  wooden fence, which was constructed by students. They manually dumped and raked soil, marking the first day of work on the garden. The project was funded by the USC Residential Student Government and the Cardinal Gardens Building Government.
Pearson, a sophomore majoring in environmental engineering, has had a passion for gardening since a young age, which she attributes to her mother. Pearson said that the idea of a community garden sprouted from the one at Parkside, which she hoped to replicate at Cardinal Gardens. Pearson communicated her proposal to the supervisors at housing management to gauge their interest, and after it was approved she reached out to residents and promoted the event through hand-distributed flyers.
“There [are] going to be fresh vegetables and herbs in the garden and all the residents will be able to come and take these things as long as they help contribute to the upkeep of the garden,” Pearson said.
The garden style is largely based on sub-irrigated planters, which are very effective for watering the plants because they can prevent over-watering of the vegetation patch. 
The watering method is also instrumental in saving water in the wake of the ongoing drought conditions in California.             The drainage pipe runs beneath the patch to get rid of the excess water.
Pearson worked with student volunteers to lay down the foundation for the garden. Soon after, they also laid the soil, tilling it for planting seeds. 
She feels that as a resident assistant, this was the best thing that she could have contributed to the community — inviting all the Cardinal Gardens residents to plant vegetables and herbs in the garden and pick them up for their kitchens when they have ripened enough.
Stephanie Allen, a senior majoring in biochemistry and a member of the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, came to help out at the event on Saturday. Allen said that such initiatives result from the collaboration of many different on-campus student organizations who come together with their resources whenever one of them needs help with a project. 
“We do service around the community and contribute by offering a helping hand where we can,” Allen said. “Personally, I think this is fun because I like gardening too, [and] I hope I will have a garden at my home. It is a great way for people in the Cardinal Gardens community to have a nice garden.”
Angela Villamizar, a sophomore majoring in international relations and NGOs and social change, is also a resident assistant at Cardinal Gardens. She said she believes that the initiative will help residents become more environmentally conscious. 
“It’s a big deal for the community,” Villamizar said. “It was important to have this community garden to help provide more resources to the residents and help to inspire them to have a healthy lifestyle and the feeling of a    community.”
The garden will be open to anyone who helps maintain it, along with several hundred residents of Cardinal Gardens.

Behind a strong performance from junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, the men’s basketball team defeated Washington 74-58 on Saturday to wrap up its regular season.
The Huskies entered the Galen Center without their multi-dimensional point guard in freshman Markelle Fultz, the Pac-12 scoring leader and projected No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft. Nevertheless, the Huskies roared early, running their offense through sophomore Noah Dickerson, who scored 15 of Washington’s 33 first-half points.
They leapt to an early 10-point lead before McLaughlin’s play on both sides of the court woke the Trojans from sleep mode en route to a 39-33 halftime lead. 
While the second half wasn’t always pretty, the Trojans never relinquished their lead.
McLaughlin capped off his greatest week of the season with a performance of 22 points, nine assists, four rebounds and four steals.
“It’s March,” McLaughlin said. “You’ve got to play your best basketball. The higher the stakes, the better I perform.”
With a stagnant offense out of the gates, McLaughlin hit two big 3s and made a couple key passes to get sophomore forward Chimezie Metu involved in the game. Then, with 2:21 seconds left in the game, McLaughlin connected with Metu once more for a forceful slam that rattled the basket and stopped the Huskies’ energy.
“Chimezie is a great weapon for our team, especially with me running the point off a pick-and-roll,” McLaughlin said. “All you have to do is throw the ball up by the rim, and he’ll go get it. He may not finish it, but he’ll bring it back down. He’s a great passer, too. And in open space, he can handle, pass it and shoot better than he did last year.”
After Metu’s emphatic slam gave the Trojans a 67-55 lead, the team never let go of their
double-digit margin. That allowed head coach Andy Enfield to summon his two seniors, Charles Buggs and Shamer Dillon, to action.
Buggs had already played nine minutes in the first half and compiled two electric highlights — a breakaway one-handed jam and a corner three. Dhillon didn’t break a sweat before McLaughlin found him in the corner for an open 3-pointer. The crowd swelled for him, a fan favorite, who had received a standing ovation before tip-off.
“Every day at shootaround, I practice that shot,” Dhillon said. “My teammates know that’s my shot, so when I got the ball I knew it was going in, no questions asked.”
Enfield was glad the senior got his moment.
“I’m just glad there wasn’t a hand in his face,” Enfield said. “What a great shot.”
USC won despite Buggs and Dhillon making half of the team’s four 3-point shots in 14 attempts (28.6 percent). The Trojans missed freshman sharpshooter Jonah Mathews, who sat out with concussion-like symptoms after taking a knee to the back of the head in practice. He is day-to-day but should be cleared to play by Wednesday’s first-round Pac-12 Tournament game.
USC also won despite a weak showing by sophomore co-captain Bennie Boatwright. The sophomore forward eventually fouled out after only 20 minutes of action. He finished his night with 9 points, two rebounds, one assist and two turnovers.
Sophomore forward Chimezie Metu also battled foul trouble, but he navigated through the ups and downs to carve a fine performance: 17 points (7-for-11), four rebounds and three blocks.
Freshman Nick Rakocevic played 21 minutes to fill the gaps left by Boatwright and Metu. Like McLaughlin, he is playing his best in March. He finished with 10 points and eight rebounds. Enfield said he stepped up in a must-win situation, like freshman guard De’Anthony Melton and Mathews have done throughout the year.
“It’s been exciting to watch the development of our young players,” Enfield said. “Our team has excelled with 23 wins. I don’t think anyone predicted this, especially with two kids leaving early, only four returning players, six who had never played in our system and our leading scorer — Boatwright — missing half of
Pac-12 play.”
Enfield believes the freshmen have exceeded expectations and played far more meaningful minutes than anyone would have anticipated when they signed with USC last fall.
Twenty-three regular season victories marks the highest win mark in a decade for USC. The last Trojan squad to match that mark was the
2006-2007 team, which also notched 23 regular season wins. That team garnered a 3-seed in the NCAA Tournament and achieved a berth in the Sweet Sixteen.
This team is on the bubble, still, but is not concerned about seeding. Team members say that they are taking March one game at a time. They needed to win on Saturday, and they will need to defend their win against Washington on Wednesday in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas.
Enfield doesn’t know if it’s an advantage or disadvantage to play Washington so soon.
“That’s who we have to play, and that’s who we’re gonna play,” Enfield said. “Everyone says it’s hard to beat a team three times in a season, but we did that last year versus UCLA.”
Should Fultz and Mathews return to action, the game may look very different.

The NFL combine was this past weekend, and the Trojans were well-represented with eight players attending. While the group was highlighted by potential first-day picks Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu
Smith-Schuster, if talent scouts are looking for draft day gems, some of the other Trojan participants should also be at the top of their list.
With that being said, both Smith-Schuster and Jackson did a lot to bolster their stock at the combine. Smith-Schuster turned in a very strong performance, answering lingering questions about his speed with a 40-yard dash in the mid 4.5’s. Combined with his incredible measurements and physical presence, the former Trojan standout has all the physical attributes a wideout needs. The combine wasn’t able to measure Smith-Schuster’s toughness, which he demonstrated at USC in spades. Much like Leonard Williams, who is already an All-Pro for the New York Jets,
Smith-Schuster consistently played through injuries and put the team ahead of his future draft stock. 
While the star receiver did have some issues with drops and concentration late in the season, his grit and determination is second to none. Many of the Trojans players at this year’s combine have a similar makeup, and when scouts combine his impressive tape with a standout combine, Smith-Schuster may move even farther up the draft boards.
In addition to Smith-Schuster, Jackson also was able to make quite the statement. The Thorpe Award winner has world-class speed and explosiveness — two qualities the NFL loves. While he isn’t quite as strong as Chiefs rookie sensation Tyreek Hill, Jackson has the same type of game-breaking impact on every play. After watching Jackson’s impact on offense late in the season, it seems crazy to have him play defense in the NFL. Outside of Hill and a few other game-breakers like Percy Harvin and DeSean Jackson, there just don’t seem to be that many individuals with the burst, vision and acceleration that Jackson possesses. While he could be a strong defensive back in the NFL if he stays healthy, he could be one of the most dangerous and feared offensive and special teams players by just touching the ball 10 to 20 times a game.
Washington’s John Ross may have gotten all of the headlines for his dazzling 40-yard dash, which shouldn’t surprise anyone who watched Pac-12 play this year, but there is another speedster out of his conference with similar ability. Both Ross and Jackson have the ability and rare skills to be giving defenses headaches for years.
In addition to the well-known Smith-Schuster and Jackson, NFL scouts should also be taking a longer look at other USC seniors such as Darreus Rogers, Justin Davis and Stevie Tu’ikolovatu. These three Trojans are not locks to be drafted, but all have excellent football ability. Whether or not they have standout combine performances — Rogers unfortunately didn’t — their bodies of work speak volumes about their abilities and impact on the field.
Rogers may not have top-end speed as a wideout, but he would be a great complementary second receiver, because he is strong and physical and fights for the ball. He did suffer from drops early in his career, but his senior season was littered with out-of-this-world catches that saved the Trojans in big games. Rogers is a warrior and competitor, and any team that picks him would be getting a steal and dependable receiver.
Compared to Rogers, Davis is a bit of a different story. Truly healthy only a few times while at USC, Davis has immense ability. When he was 100 percent, he was one of the best running backs in the country. He glides more than runs, and has a preternatural sense with his vision. The question on that front is whether or not he can stay healthy and deal with the physicality of the NFL — but if he can, Davis is a tremendous change-of-pace back who also contributes as a blocker and pass catcher out of the backfield. He would thrive in a place like New England, where the running backs are asked to do a bit of everything.
Finally, Tu’ikolovatu is getting some buzz after his tremendous performance in the Rose Bowl, but he still is being undersold. The strong and grizzled lineman takes up so much space in the middle of the field and changes the complexion of a defense. While at 25, he is older than most draft prospects, he still has the talent and strength that most executives hope their players grow into one day. Much like Rogers, Tu’ikolovatu may not have all of the measurables, but his on-field impact was startling. He was the primary reason USC’s defensive line was so stout throughout the year.
The Trojans’ history with draft picks in the last decade has certainly been mixed, but one area they have shown a knack for is having late-round draft picks stick around on rosters for a while. The same will probably be true this year. In addition to the trio mentioned above, if former Trojans like Michael Hutchings, De’Quan Hampton and Isaac Whitney get a chance in the NFL, it would not be a shock to see them turn into major contributors. USC is so deep at certain positions, like receiver, that sometimes the players have to wait until the NFL for their talent to shine through.

The Los Angeles Lantern Festival marks one of the few of the last Chinese New Year festivities of the year. To the Chinese, the festival represents the end of annual celebrations and signifies that it is time to get back to work. 
Caroline Kinley | Daily Trojan
This year, guests of the 16th annual Los Angeles Lantern Festival were lucky to not feel a single rain drop. Located next to the Chinese American Museum, conveniently close to Union Station, the lantern festival brought crowds of citizens to take part in fostering cultural conversation. 
Unlike many commercial urban celebrations, the festival focuses on its cultural mission to educate and strengthen the Chinese American community. It is a celebration for everyone — from families with children to millennials and adults, ready to engage in a deeper perception of America’s diverse cultural plate.
The festival is free, with entertainment performances that showcase the Chinese cultural legacy. Kids and adults were involved in lantern-making and Chinese calligraphy; the activities were easy to follow and engaging.
Examples of possible visitor creations from craft stations, red Chinese lanterns embellished the spaces around the festival’s main locations. As symbols of a prosperous lifestyle, these lanterns fostered community building and cultural education through a live experience. 
Other hands-on activities and workshops were offered for free, with attendees involved in tigger puppet making, page coloring and face painting. These interactive forms of learning created platforms for cultural communication between young and old Chinese Americans.
Live entertainment shows took place at an open air gazebo in the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, with sing-and-dance groups and magic shows. This year, young Chinese American talent from Poprock Academy seemed confident on stage, performing popular American songs for a curious crowd. 
Skilled tricks from a variety of magicians were accompanied by Chinese music, bolstering the festive mood. The interactive performances encouraged observers to join the entertainers on stage. 
Many visitors flocked to the museum to try Chinese meals from food trucks located at the venue. Phantom Food Truck, Steamy Bun Truck, Tainamite Truck and Lobsta Truck were a few present; their food offered a fusion of Chinese and American culinary experiences. 
Representing the diversity of Los Angeles, the Lantern Festival allows the Chinese American Museum to advance in its mission of sharing its historical traditions. Though the event marked the end of  Chinese New Year celebrations, it created a never-ending exchange of traditions for guests of all ages.

“Lies,” “false,” “untrue” and, famously, “wrong”  have been thrown back and forth between the Trump administration and the media since the campaign cycle for the 2016 presidential election began almost two years ago. When Trump’s campaign revolved around his unorthodox demeanor and candid language, he was just a candidate: He did not have legitimate power or accountability. Since taking office of the President of the United States, however, Trump has continued to dub major news outlets, including The New York Times, NBC and CNN, as “fake news.” The attack on the free press, which started out as almost comical in nature, has become a devastating issue threatening the values of the Constitution.
Only an informed and educated population can counter this assault on democracy. USC and other universities need to implement programs that foster media literacy and political awareness.
Trump’s portrayal of the media is not only appalling, but also — frankly — frightening. With today’s national political divide, Trump’s policies are under immense scrutiny from both sides of the political spectrum.
However, as the general public focuses on issues like Trump’s stance on the Affordable Care Act and his temporary immigration ban — which are, granted, issues with tremendous consequences — some of Trump’s other major power plays have gone unnoticed by the general populace.
Authoritarian tones saturate the statements and actions of the Trump administration. Trump has engaged in censorship by limiting the power of the free press and banning various outlets, such as CNN and The New York Times, from press conferences. By constantly tweeting that independent papers are “fake” and “wrong,” Trump uses his Twitter account as a platform for propaganda.
It is alarming that Trump calls media reports “fake” when there are confirmed sources and scientific data behind news articles. Though some argue that Trump is entitled to his own free speech, remember that he is not just a man sitting behind a computer screen. His words and actions hold power over millions of Americans and many countries. His words have real-world consequences, and his free speech ultimately serves to make himself more powerful.
Trump’s power shift holds our democracy as we know it at stake. An uneducated or wilfully ignorant populace is virtually a powder keg. Add in bias from social media and take away the independent free press, and there will be destruction. Trump and his administration have been called out for lying on numerous occasions, yet he has never personally admitted culpability. By not adhering to the truth, he casts doubt on the factuality of news. With enough reasonable suspicion, the population may choose to not believe in the press and defer to the tweets and reports of the executive branch.
This First Amendment problem is fixable, and could even be made irrelevant, if American citizens were educated using a variety of sources and taught from a young age to understand all sides of an issue. Education is the cornerstone for growing the United States into the great nation Trump campaigned on. Fostering an environment that stimulates students and offers ranging perspectives is integral to improving and unifying our country.
Teaching students how to think for themselves and understand those around them is something that all schools, especially universities, need to implement. At a time when constitutional rights are being questioned, political activism and diligent media are needed now more than ever — and among millennials in particular, as they will soon take the reins and assume responsibility for the future political climate.
High schools should encourage open classroom debate where students can share their thoughts. USC, and universities around the country,  need to ensure that all students are politically educated. Participation from all students in political classes should be mandatory. Arguing from the opposite point of view will develop students’ awareness of differing perspectives. Making news more accessible to students and offering higher student discounts to read online articles can improve political consciousness.
The future starts with educating young people today. The Constitution is what holds democracy together, and protecting our First Amendment rights need to be the utmost priority.
Career politicians got us in this mess. So you’re ok with career politicians who have acquired their multi millionaire status while in the employ of American citizens such as Pelosi, Reid , Schumer and others who have made millions while inoffice?  Our founding fathers did not envision career politicians to run the country but private citizens to do so for a short term.  Career politicians want you and I to live by their rules, yet they do not live by their own rules.  Otherwise, you would be in favor of congressional term limits, eli m in a ting the federal gov healthcare plan and retirement plan and have them participate in the plans that Americans have to use.
And what has President Trump done to stifle a free press? He has had more press conferences so far than any president in recent history.  He just wants the press to report on the news, not issue op ed statements as a replacement for news.  And when the press proves themselves to create fake news stories or not accurately report on news stories then you don’t allow them to play.  Your DR has that policy. Your university has that policy.  
Freedom of speech works both ways, not just when it is agreeable by you. The effort by the Left to silence conservative speech is against the law and is gr I undo for creating a very hostile environment.  Since when has that type of protest become the MO for today?  On L y since the Democrats lost the election and we’re told by Americans that we are tired of their liberal tactics and ways to empower themselves over Americans.  You talk about wanting to see both sides of the issues, but you, young people on todays college campuses, don’t allow it occur if you disagree with an opposing viewpoint. Why?  
While I agree with you that as a country – we are in a bit of a rut. I don’t think that politicians are to blame, afterall – we the people are suppose to be the ones electing these politicians to office. I agree to some extent that government positions should follow the same fringe benefit plans that the rest of the American people use… but by that same token… would you be able to identify what your defined “Americans” use? As far as I know… it varies from person to person. There is no universal health policy plan. There is no universal retirement plan. If there were, there would be droves of people complaining that our country is now socialist. For what it’s worth – I am all for term limits.
Well, I can think of at least two times in this administration where mass media was limited to invite only. I have also bared witness to almost all of the press conferences he and his staff have hosted, when they hear something they don’t like… they tell them to shut up – regardless of the content of the question. If the question angers president Trump, he brushes it away with labeling them as “fake”. Just because President Trump doesn’t like something, does not make it fake. Once he throws out that label, all of the loyal followers just reiterate it – with no care or cause to actually research the content or extent of the question. Mind you, I am not a fool – there are plenty of less than stellar media agencies out there, both left and right. I just don’t think any person, conservative or liberal, should jump on any bandwagon because of what 1 person says – regardless of his or her position of power. You are right, this University (USC) does have that policy… but we are a private BUSINESS. The government was never meant to run as a business – and it never should be. The government should be a congregation and representation of the nation/state/city, and not a business.
I agree, freedom of speech is a two way street. That is how it should be – with all parties respecting the others. Making blanket statements and pointing fingers is doing little to actually help the issues we are facing. Your statement about the MO arising from the Democrats losing, is a fallacy. Conflicts have always arisen when dealing with human interactions. It is always the goal of one person or group to be correct. The evidence is written in any history book you can ever imagine. The future is told by those who win, the other group(s) are silenced. You did a very interesting thing in your last paragraph, you separated “liberals” from the word “Americans” as if they are two different stand alone things. They aren’t. Liberals are just as American as Conservatives and vice versa… that is what it means to be American… the option to express and live freely. 
Please don’t make this personal. You are lumping me into a category of “young people” as if that were a category I belong to. I am as angry as an “red blooded conservative” when anyone walks over and shuts other people down for their beliefs. After all… there are two sides to every coin… please don’t be the person on the red team, pointing fingers at the people on the blue team. We have enough of them, and it is my belief that THEY are the ones the got us “in this mess”.
From a fellow patriot, Dexter Wilson 
Every one of President Trump’s choices for his cabinet have been very good. He has in effect restored integrity to the office. Obama was a student and follower of a atheist named Saul Alinsky. Saul Alinsky considered himself a student of Frank Nitti, Whom you students don’t know but he was the underling of Al Capone, the murderous gangster of Chicago, and hence the result of the corrupt politicians in Chicago and the state of Illinois.  Also, Hillary Clinton said her mentor was Saul Alinsky and wrote her law school thesis on Alinksy. Now if you want to know more about Saul, I suggest that you get a Catholic produced documentary “A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing”. The Catholics sought after Alinsky as a Community Organizer and discovered the Socialist Communist that he was, an amoral individual. They also present evidence of the fact that liberals, progressives and Democrats love those names, but they were told to use those names instead of SOCIALIST and COMMUNIST by their leaders when these people started using these more “lovable” names. According the film they were told to do so by their socialist and communist leaders, Bella Dodd, Alexander Tracthenberg, and Norman Thomas. 
We have all heard Senator Chuck Schumer (NY-D) call Hillary an honorable person. Now tell me… when she destroyed court ordered evidence, ran a “pay for play” and money laundering scheme aka The Clinton Foundation and used her private server, contrary to federal law, that she is honorable? 
Schumer then calls a solid God loving Christian, Jeff Sessions, a liar and criminal who told the truth under oath unlike Hillary. That tells me that Schumer, a lawyer who know you are not to volunteer any more information than yea and nay under oath and knew that Sessions did not lie under oath, what does that make him . It makes him in reality a socialist or Communist who is amoral. 
As for Trump, he is like the everyman of America, much like the expectation of our founders that they wanted CITIZEN POLITICIANS in government who were not CAREER POLITICIANS like Leahy, Schumer, Feinstein, Pelosi and others who exemplify the category of AMORAL CAREER POLITICIANS. If you have been following the truth, many of these amoral newsmen (ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN and some on Fox News, even after it was is still clear there has been no proof or evidence that there was a connection between Trump’s Administration and the Russians, they continue to imply there is a connection. Now we have seen and heard on national TV, Obama whisper in the ear of the number two man in the Kremlin, Medvedev… “Wait until the election is over so I will have more Flexibility” and God knows what he meant by that. We have seen that he has met with the Russian Ambassador in question 22 times, Schumer 20 times. Hillary was given millions by a Russian Backed Company to buy American Uranium Mines, even as far back as Ted Kennedy having met with a Russian Ambassador in 1983 to discuss methods of preventing President Reagan from a getting a second term. NOW TELL ME WHO HAS MORE CONNECTIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS THAN The Democrats?
I wanna live in the America you live in! Full of “everyman” billionaires. I can’t speak for our founders like you can, but I highly doubt they had our president in mind when they were devising our constitution. 
This article was about media literacy. However that seems to be lost on you, made apparent by your quick recital of your list of names and events all conveniently geared towards only one set of ideals. 
Then again, what the heck do I know. *shrug*
Media literacy?  Kids today have no clue as to what that means.  The media controls your thoughts, your words, your actions. This is why I brought up Trump, because he will not let the media determine the false narrative that they have been pushing for many years.  Be happy you have a president that is not owned by any political party of donor.  President Donald Trump gave up his career and his fortune to do what has been needed to be done for decades.  He will either succeed of the US will no longer be the greatest country in world history, that has kept the peace since 1945.
With all due respect, I think that is what the article is trying to convey. That schools should teach people how to read and understand every angle of every form of media. Two sides to every coin type of thing. 
The media is a very powerful tool, and yes I do believe that some people take full advantage of that. However, President Trump denying the media (which is how the populous stays informed)  the opportunity to represent or be witness to the happenings of our government, goes against the very basic liberties that our country values. Mr. Trump as a person is a phenomenal businessman, there is no denying that – but when it comes to being open and providing concrete evidence for his statements to the American people…again, he is a phenomenal businessman. 
Also, he did not give up his business or his fortune. He handed down his business to his children (that is hardly giving it up) and last I checked, he still owned quite a few pretty dwellings around the world, and I haven’t heard of him liquidating his bank account. He is still a billionaire, as is many of the cabinet members he pushed through. If you think that the American people are best served by the billionaires that have taken residence in the White House, then I suppose you are now living in your ideal America. I for one have a very hard time believing that all those business billionaires in the White House have the American people at the forefront of their agenda. They are after-all – billionaire businessmen/women. They did not line their bank accounts with the kindness they have shown to the American workers.
Also, history has a funny way of repeating itself… this hasn’t been the first time that a country or civilization has claimed to be the “greatest”. For what it’s worth, saying that the US keeps the peace is not entirely accurate. We are not the only country who is tending to the conflicts of the world, we are of course a main player, but by no means the only one. Furthermore, we have had “career politicians” running the country since 1945… not loose cannon businessmen.
How in the hell do you teach students to think for themselves  without telling them how to think ? It’s something you find out on your own not from the leftwing Teachers union, and if your going to teach them how to think then the military should be allowed on campus to teach them how to ” think for themselves ” about the military service.

Last week, the USC administration announced a 3.9 percent increase in university tuition for the 2017-2018 academic year. Come fall, the new cost of tuition will be $53,448 — $2,006 more than current tuition. Although the USC administration has expressed its commitment to maintaining one of the largest financial aid pools in the nation, questions remain as to how, if at all, this latest tuition increase will address the needs of hungry students. 
As the cost of higher education increases, the number of students who are food-insecure rises concurrently. The National Student Campaign Against Hunger & Homelessness conducted a recent study with three campus-based organizations to understand the pervasiveness of food insecurity on college campuses. The study sample includes 3,765 students in 12 states, all from eight different  community colleges and 26 four-year colleges and universities. The study’s findings are both alarming and sobering. The findings show that 48 percent of respondents reported food insecurity in the previous 30 days. Moreover, students of color are disproportionately food insecure, according to the study. Fifty-seven percent of black students reported food insecurity, compared to 40 percent of their white, non-Hispanic peers.
The facts and figures point to one apparent reality: Colleges and universities must do more for food-insecure students. Food insecurity and a complete education cannot coincide. The hungry student working more than 20 hours a week, allocating most of their time to tracking down a free or affordable meal and pushing through a three-hour lecture with hunger pangs, is not receiving the same education as their food-secure classmate.
USC has taken steps to mitigate this unconscionable disparity. The Dornsife College Office of Diversity and Strategic Initiatives, in partnership with Campus Activities, has supported the Virtual Food Pantry, a project that provides Ralph’s gift cards to students, offers services that teach budgeting to students and connects them with financial aid representatives. This initiative started with a donation from Leo and Dorothy Braudy, who worked directly with Dornsife’s Center for Democracy and Diversity to confront underprivileged students’ most salient needs.  As the cost of living in Los Angeles has become prohibitively expensive for many students, resources such as the Virtual Food Pantry are vital.
However, institutions of higher learning, including USC, can and must do more. Specifically, the government and educational institutions will most effectively tackle the issue of food insecurity if they work together. For most students who grew up in poverty, the free breakfast and lunch programs, as well as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, that once kept them fed during the school day may suddenly disappear or become difficult to access upon entering college. Expanding SNAP eligibility requirements for college students, and allowing them to use these benefits to pay for college expenses, would be one concrete step toward effectively addressing food insecurity. 
Ultimately, the most effective solutions will be the product of more research. Food insecurity on college and university campuses remains an often overlooked phenomenon. As one of the largest research universities in the world — thanks, in part, to rising tuition — USC has a responsibility to seek solutions and provide all of its students with an equal educational environment.

After releasing arguably the most anticipated album of 2017, Ed Sheeran makes his triumphant return to the world of pop by presenting a work that prefers to be understated. Divide (stylized ÷) isn’t a comeback album or a continuation of previous efforts; it is its own ferocious album, fusing different sounds and themes into a work that stands as a testament to a mature songwriter and his increasingly unique voice in the world of pop.
With Multiply (x), Sheeran created songs that could be easily released as promotional singles, but Divide is a more intimate offering. Gone are the atmospheric productions of “Bloodstream” and “Photograph” — they are replaced with softer, more intricate guitar patterns. At the helm is Sheeran himself, commanding an album that might otherwise be directionless. 
He doesn’t create anthems for arenas. This time around, he opts for quieter songs of reflection and analysis. He’s more likely to let his voice float from song to song than belt with the intensity of “Thinking Out Loud,” allowing his vocals and lyrics to shine.
There is something to offer for fans of all genres. He tackles top-40 radio with his smash hit “Shape of You,” an infectious banger that is both minimalistic and tight with its production. Sheeran raps on opening track “Eraser,” a song that expresses his insecurity about fame, while “Galway Girl,” a more experimental track, intertwines an Irish fiddle into the background of Sheeran’s vocal storytelling.
Nevertheless, there are tracks that fall flat, particularly when Sheeran croons about love. “Perfect” feels more like it would belong in a boring version of a Cinderella story, as Sheeran falls into a love story cliche, pining to an imaginary lover. It breaks no new ground; the guitars are lost in the background and Sheeran’s voice never quite reaches the intensity the song needs. 
Sheeran is best when his songs are pronounced rather than restrained. “New Man” makes use of rap-sung vocals to satirize an ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend he feels is not right for her. Sheeran’s lyricism shines, as he skeptically paints a picture of a jerk who “wear[s] sunglasses indoors, in winter, at night time” and “makes a gang sign” every time he hears a rap song, before admonishing his old lover about her outlandish behavior.
Meanwhile, “Castle on the Hill” is a coming-of-age anthem that soars. Sheeran’s vocals are their peak; his voice cracks at its most intense point. There is pure vulnerability in his lyrics: He takes the listener on a picturesque journey through a chaotic childhood with his friends. He does not fall into the trap of nostalgia, offering a fresh perspective on adolescence with his whimsical and down-to-earth storytelling.
Closing out the standard edition of the album is the heartbreaking “Supermarket Flowers,” an ode to Sheeran’s deceased grandmother. “Hallelujah / You were an angel in the shape of my mum,” Sheeran laments in his lyrics — pain fills his voice and echoes over a somber piano melody. Harmonies and backup vocals are introduced in the chorus, haunting the listener with its simplicity and power. 
Some of the best songs are on the deluxe edition of the album, worthwhile additions to Divide. “Barcelona” experiments with flutes and horns: Sheeran’s voice is energized as he belts out his lyrics in Spanish. 
“Bibia Be Ye Ye” prompts the listener to get on their feet and grab a partner with Ghanian-influenced sounds and lyrics; the guitar is light and frothy to complement Sheeran’s fast-paced vocals. “Nancy Mulligan” takes what was started in “Galway Girl” and perfects it, bringing the fiddle to the front and center to create a dance anthem that pays homage to Sheeran’s roots. 
He adds hip-hop elements and stomping beats as the song progresses, spiraling into a glorious chaos that can’t help but leave the listener smiling. 
Divide is not the album fans may have been expecting from Sheeran. Yet, Sheeran always aims to defy expectations and evolve while staying true to his sound. With Divide, he further distances himself from conventional pop, preferring minimalism to the big-production radio pop. As a result, he created a work that is both easily accessible and challenging, and ultimately succeeding in his own style.

With Love Market and Café’s apple green walls are adorned with the words, “Our community is beautiful, authentic, hard-working, strong, diverse” and their Spanish equivalent, “Nuestra comunidad es bella, autentica, trabajadora, fuerte and diversa.” 
The organization celebrated its one-year anniversary on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., featuring games, delicious food and a celebration of the good accomplished in the community.
 The market and cafe, located on South Vermont Avenue, kills three birds with one stone — it’s a market, cafe and non-profit community program that aims to eliminate food deserts and foster community development in South Los Angeles. 
 Every product in the market provides locally sourced organic produce, meats and dairy. Its cafe provides healthy selections like sandwiches, smoothies and tea made with only fresh ingredients. Its non-profit, With Love Community programs, offers free classes that educate people on “healthy eating, child development, exercise and other life skills … enabling our community to thrive,” according to the official website.
 Not the typical cafe, With Love is a reflection of the past, present and future of South Los Angeles. The store is decorated according to South Central culture, originality and style with a mission of making the local community a better and healthier place to live. The cafe and market also provide space on the first and second floors, in addition to the outside patio, to relax, socialize and study.
 All of its proceeds are promised to be reinvested to the local community, whether by providing jobs and internships for L.A. locals or by training and empowering residents. 
 Andrew McDowell, the founder and CEO of the market, devoted years to researching the needs of South Los Angeles before starting this social entrepreneurial venture, which began with a Kickstarter campaign.
“We’re trying to prove that communities like ours, which is very diverse but yet lower income, deserve, want and can sustain better quality products,” McDowell said. “It’s a proof of [the] concept that a community can sustain a business like ours that provides  a higher resource or product.”
 The CEO said that he’d also like to expand services and programs by bringing local produce and organic groceries to other places in the near future.
 Last month, the market launched its first free library, With Love Little Library, a collection of books that are free to customers without restrictions. 
When asked about the future of With Love, McDowell said that he hopes to unite the USC and Los Angeles communities.
 “We’re just trying to expand our offerings to meet the real needs of the community — more exercise classes, cooking classes and more resources,” McDowell said. “We’re trying to understand how to provide programs that help both USC and the community and unify them together by changing lives, giving more jobs and making it a better place to live.”

I think twice before speaking. And no, it’s not because I’m afraid of expressing myself.
It sounds like a trivial concern, but it’s because, sometimes, I mispronounce words.
It started when I was in first grade. Because I grew up in a household with two Vietnamese parents who spoke rough English, mispronunciation was common.
However, we embraced our strange version of speech. I grew up on the streets of Little Saigon in the city of Westminster, a corner of the world where it was appropriate to speak English with a heavy Southern Vietnamese accent (I called it
Viet-glish), drawing out each emphatic syllable so foreign English words flowed recognizably from our mouths. My parents and our neighbors spoke English coated with fresh Vietnamese mannerisms, with misplaced adjectives and incorrect tenses. 
I realized that our type of speech was not welcomed, or even understood, when I was about six years old in the aisles of a newly constructed Ralphs. My mother was pushing her shopping cart through the condiments section, reading aloud to me the labels of bottled ketchup and mustard in her imperfectly perfect Viet-glish. She was looking for mayonnaise, but she said it differently: Mayonnaise was shortened, its syllables pronounced distinctly as mah-yoh. Ketchup was gat-chap and mustard sounded like mus-der.
She approached a middle-aged clerk to ask in her thick accent where the mayonnaise was located, and the clerk turned to me, confused.
“I don’t understand what she is saying,” the clerk told me.
“We’re looking for mah-yoh and mus-der,” I said, explaining to her that it was the stuff people put on their hot dogs. It took me several attempts before the clerk finally understood. She clucked her tongue, nodding to me as she walked down the aisle.
“You mean mayonnaise and mustard,” she said in her crisp American accent. Every syllable was clearly enunciated; it was textbook English, the type of English I didn’t grow up speaking, and for once, I felt shame heat up my cheeks — simply because I mispronounced a word.
I was too young to understand the nuances of racial microaggressions in society or even to recognize the “foreigner” label placed on Asian Americans due to cultural stereotypes and obvious physical differences.
I grew up bothered and subconsciously aware of these microaggressions made against my parents who spoke imperfect English. Instead of realizing that these incidents were a byproduct of American society, I blamed my family: their speech habits and their strange mispronunciation of words I grew up accustomed to. I corrected them rudely — cutting into their half-formed sentences with my polished English.
But I, too, was not without fault when it came to speaking English. I desperately wished for my tongue to not trip on complicated, multi-syllabic words. I mumbled words when reading aloud in class if I wasn’t sure of the pronunciation. To this day, I still avoid speaking unfamiliar words; mispronunciation of certain English words becomes a painful, shameful association with the “foreigner” label that comes with the Asian American identity.
I was fortunate enough to grow up in the suburbs of Orange County, surrounded by peers of all colors and cultural backgrounds. Nevertheless, the foreign stigma never escapes any Asian American; these stereotypes prevail through the mockery of Asian immigrant accents, the fetishization of Asian women and the generalization of Asians into homogeneous ethnic categories.
The shame of mispronunciation and Asian accents marks the beginning  of my multi-layered struggle for identity and recognition in American society. This shame is caused not only by our accents, but also by our blood and heritage and further stigmatized by the “foreign” characteristics many Asian adolescents struggle with and attempt to repress. I would like to believe that I have shed this layer of shame, replacing it with a strong-willed defiance to these social stereotypes. 
However, when I view the FOX Watters’ World segment that racially mocks Chinese Americans or hear of the Kansas shooting that took the life of an Indian American man, I am afflicted by that deeply held shame. We are still perceived as foreigners, I realize, every time a stranger asks me where I’m from or what is the proper way to greet me.

Ya know, I was at a Panda Express last week. And there was this, who I presume, Eastern European white woman with a thick accent ahead of me . I don’t know, it’s petty, but she spoke with a conspicuous accent and just called things as she pleased…So this fat Latina, with a sassy attitude, is working the Panda Express. And she asks, “What can I get for you?” Lady says, “Rrrhice and spaghetti…” So the fat sassy Latina girl asks, “You mean chow mein?!” in a condescending, nativist tone. If I was that fat Latina, I wouldn’t have made a big deal about what the woman said. Just go through the goddamn motions and stop acting so nativist….I wouldn’t be proud of being an employee of Panda Express first of all, because it shows how far you haven’t got in life. 
In my mind, I was like “Gaaawd dayaam.” Small minded muthafuckin people who want to belittle others because they’re racist or just got nothing more important to quibble about.

As a second semester junior, I have been a part of five clubs. Surprisingly, USC boasts over 800 student organizations, which put on a plethora of events on and off campus. Having only scratched the surface of a few student groups, this semester, I plan to take part in various meetings and events, in hopes to highlight the many diverse talents found across USC.

USC Rocket Propulsion Lab provides an opportunity for students to take part in the design and assemblage of rockets. With no prerequisite to join, I relished the opportunity to observe these devoted members hard at work.
A recent Daily Trojan article highlighted the efforts of RPL members in their preparation of an upcoming rocket launch, scheduled for March 4. Gaining attention, RPL encourages fellow Trojans, novices and experts alike, to take part in the vision and execution of rocket-building. 
As a humanities major, I felt myself entering unchartered territory. Although understanding the exact mechanics of a rocket seem blurry, I view RPL members as fearless problem solvers attempting to make sense of certain chemical reactions. This organization is the culmination of great minds focused on one endeavor‒space.
Haley Karow, Communications Outreach and Launch Coordinator of RPL, discussed the incredible accessibility of the organization. Open to everyone, RPL consists of a variety of majors, including fine arts and business administration. Moreover, Karow added that RPL wants to be the first student-run organization to launch in space. This is no small feat; however, the unwavering dedication demonstrated by these students is truly inspiring. 
One concern many students face when they are considering joining a club is that they are too shy or inexperienced to get involved. When I asked Karow what advice she’d give to these students, she gave some insight on how the meetings work.
“On the first day, you’ll get hands on experience,” Karow said. “Come on in anytime.” 
Working each night 6 to 9 p.m., RPL members play an integral role in fostering a welcoming atmosphere. 
“This organization is why I came to USC,” said Connor CImo, a junior majoring in astronautical engineering.

Having spoken to these talented and driven students, I realized that no two Trojans are exactly the same. Rather, it is our unbridled passion that unites us all. It is truly admirable that no matter the outcome of each launch, RPL members eagerly return to the lab to implement changes. This insatiable hunger for success represents the “fight on” spirit of USC.

Last December, I watched as my roommates eagerly packed before they set off to spend their vacation at home. I couldn’t help but feel sad that I wasn’t. Staying away wasn’t new to me. I had lived independently before — for education and for work — away from the comfort of family. Looking back, moving for the first time had been a major upheaval. But even then, the initial homesickness had worn off as soon as I adapted to the hostel life. Eventually, I began enjoying it. I must have thought grad life would be no different. 
Except it isn’t. I guess the thought that if need be, family is only a bus journey away is just so reassuring in your head, that the lack of it makes all the difference when you’re studying abroad. 
So, when I finally got to visit India for a sibling’s wedding, I realized just how much I had missed the feeling of being home.
Photo from The Happy Page
Sure, today there’s Hangouts, Whatsapp and a plethora of apps competing to make sure you don’t miss even that tiny new bump that’s developed on your loved one’s face; but nothing could match the intimacy of seeing the animated sparkle in the eyes of my supportive spouse, for once not on a screen but as he welcomed me at the airport!
In Los Angeles, I am greeted by strangers all the time. I feel humbled every time a cab driver or a passerby asks me how I’m doing. But when my mom hugged me and asked me the same the moment I reached home, I realized how despondent I had been to hear it from her. 
Initially when I had just moved here, I remember the nearly empty streets and the sheer silence of the neighborhood striking me as queer. For someone coming from a crowded country like India, it was very unsettling. It took the loud chatter of family and wedding house chaos to get me to admit how much I had missed it all.
On the other hand, at the risk of being branded as “Americanized” by family, I discovered how L.A. life had already changed me. When I first arrived in the United States, right hand side driving was very confusing for me, and I always assumed it would be the hardest to shake when I started driving myself.  But turns out, our brains are faster at unlearning than learning stuff. From the moment I hit the roads in India, the left hand side traffic made my mind send out confused signals. Just six months in the United States, and I realized I had started taking for granted, some basic necessities that are still luxuries back in India. I missed not having to bother about long power cuts, having central air conditioning everywhere and more often than I’d care to admit, turned faucet knobs the other way and wondered why there was no hot water. I realized just how much college slang had grown on me when I addressed dear husband as “dude.”
Saying goodbye to family felt more harder than ever this time, since the novelty of the “new life” that I had set out to seek earlier had worn off. I realized that as much as I loved having the newfound luxuries in my life and the freedom to explore new raw possibilities, taking on the world alone could get a little exhausting. I spent the first leg of the journey lamenting over how the anticipation of going home was more fun than actually going, since the days rolled by too fast! But a few pathetic in-flight meals later, I had made my peace with it; Sometimes you just have to suck it up, since happiness is only one small step outside of suffering. 
I guess this is the grind for everyone living away from their families:
You value family more and slog to earn the chance to get back to them. And when you do get there, you revel at the luxury of being pampered by everyone and return loaded with the love and all the goodies that they so lovingly packed for you. 
At the customs counter at LAX., the officer asked me if I was carrying chicken masala in my bag. And when I chuckled for a response, he remarked to the other passengers that Indians do get it.
I wasn’t really carrying chicken masala (I’m a vegetarian); but he was right, Indians can’t live without their spices! As I passed through the gates, I thought to myself — after those unpalatable in-flight meals, I definitely need to rake out that spicy chutney powder from my luggage for dinner tonight.

As Downtown Los Angeles experiences revitalization, it attracts many artists from around the globe, from world-class professionals and hopeful beginners. Last weekend I had the chance to visit Downtown L.A.’s Arts District, a lively hub for art that beautifully captures Los Angeles’ creative and dynamic energy.
Located a few blocks away from Little Tokyo and the L.A. River, the Los Angeles Arts District hosts vegan restaurants, breweries, cocktail bars and many, many museums. 20th-century abandoned warehouses have turned into stylish stores, galleries and museums. People stroll around leisurely, eating ice cream from the famous Salt & Straw, walking in and out of boutique bookstores or taking pictures with their friends and pets. Music floats in the air, mixing with the constant hum of laughter and conversations.

As I made my way through the neighborhood, I began to notice the ever-present graffiti. The brick walls along the streets were mostly covered in painted words, symbols and faces. Some of the graffiti were new and some looked weathered, but none of them felt like a violation of its surroundings. Instead, I felt like the graffiti were an important part of the neighborhood and gave the Arts District its unique character.
After wandering for a while, I decided to go see an exhibition that recently opened at an internationally-known contemporary arts gallery called Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, housed in a restored 100,000-square-foot flour mill complex. The exhibition included six installations by the late Los Angeles artist Jason Rhoades. Rhoades’ works used interesting materials including bright neon signs hanging from the ceiling in a seemingly chaotic manner. I saw people from all ages and backgrounds, talking excitedly among themselves or taking photos with the picturesque, Instagram-worthy installations.
