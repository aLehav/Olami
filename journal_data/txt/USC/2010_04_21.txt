Don Ludwig couldn’t help but get a bit teary-eyed at the mention of the 2010 President’s Award for Staff Achievement, an honor recently given to him by USC President Steven B. Sample.

The award, which recognizes faculty members who have made outstanding contributions to the enhancement of USC, is in its 29th year  and is presented to the winner at a staff recognition luncheon each spring and includes a small monetary reward.
Ludwig has spent the last two years as executive director of USC Spirit and Traditions, and has worked 34 years in USC Recreational Sports. He said he is flattered by the award but does not think such an honor should be handed to any one faculty member in particular.
“There’s just so many staff that assist everybody, in particular with me in recreation sports for those years,” Ludwig said. “I had a great, great, great staff, and great student support and great support from Student Affairs to create a great program and great facilities.”
Last year’s winner, Mariano Elepano, said receiving the award was an extraordinary experience, and he was glad to see Ludwig get it this year.
Elepano headed this year’s advisory committee, which is in charge of compiling a list of the top three faculty choices for the award. The list is then sent to the university president, who decides the winner.
“Don deserves it,” Elepano said. “When I came to school here, he was around already and he has a lot of interaction with the community.”
Diane Schrader, coordinator of the award process, said 42 staff members were nominated this year, making Ludwig’s win a testament to his contributions to the school.
“These are people that really love ’SC, and it shows in what their colleagues say about them and the programs they’re involved in,” Schrader said. “What the panel saw in [Ludwig] was unparalleled enthusiasm for serving students and others at USC.”
Ludwig is involved in a number of campus programs, including Swim with Mike and is the executive director of Spirituality and Sports. He advises the Recreational Sports Department and assists incoming freshmen, transfers and parents, teaching them everything there is to know about Trojan traditions.
“Don was my first supervisor when I came to USC,” said Jennifer Siu, director of Recreational Sports and former colleague of Ludwig’s. “You always want to have a good supervisor and I did. He is one of the most dedicated and loyal individuals on campus.”
Varun Soni, the dean of Religious Life, recently worked with Ludwig on “Giving it All, On and Off the Field,” a discussion about athletes and philanthropy that included a panel with former USC football player Matt Leinart.
“It’s his dedication to the Trojan Family,” Soni said of what made Ludwig win the award. “He always brings that spirit of generosity to whatever he does.”
Friends and faculty said they think no one is more deserving.
“He epitomizes what the university asks for from staff,” Siu said. “It’s long overdue.”
Schrader said Ludwig is so committed to USC that at the mention of Ludwig, another faculty member responded with “Oh, Fight On!”
“This year will be President Sample’s last award recipient,” Schrader said. “So it’s nice that it’s going to Don, who’s been here for so long.”
Ludwig said he was honored to receive such recognition.
“It’s a great honor to receive the award his last year of being president,” he said. “For [Sample] to be able to give it to me within the last few months [of his presidency] is unique.”
As for his future plans, Ludwig said he hasn’t set anything in stone. He said he’s enjoying his job thoroughly and has no plans of retiring any time soon.
“It depends on who you talk to,” Ludwig joked. “If you want to talk to me, someday I’d like to retire. If you talk to my wife, she wouldn’t want me at home as much.”
This award is for staff, not for faculty (it’s in the title of the award for heaven’s sake), and Mr. Ludwig is not a faculty member, but a staff member.  It’s a shame that your fact checking is so lax.

Last spring, Robyn Wolfish noticed Nikki Geffen’s post on Facebook saying she would be attending USC FreshFest, a program hosted by USC Hillel for incoming freshmen. Wolfish immediately messaged Geffen, predicting that the two might be similar enough to make good roommates.
The two girls are just one example of a growing trend — incoming freshmen search for classmates on Facebook and other networking sights in hopes of connecting with a potential roommate.
Unlike a number of universities, USC gives students the opportunity to request a roommate. Though some freshmen ask to live with students they know from high school, others find roommates through social networking sites, using limited information to guess who might be a good fit.
With the enrollment deadline quickly approaching, students in the incoming freshmen class are now filling out housing applications and making the decision whether to request a roommate or have one chosen at random by the university.
Britanny Cheng, an incoming freshman majoring in environmental studies, is currently using Facebook to connect with her future classmates.
“I plan on finding a roommate online because it gives me insight on who my new roommate will be,” Cheng said. “It provides me with a great sense of security that my roommates and I will be compatible.”
For Wolfish, a freshman majoring in print journalism, and Geffen, a freshman majoring in public relations, Facebook was the best method to find a similar roommate.
“We started talking and found out a lot about each other,” Wolfish said.
Geffen said their similar religious backgrounds and similar majors helped the two girls build a connection.
Both girls said they would recommend this way of finding a roommate to incoming students.
“If you see somebody that sounds compatible, don’t be afraid to talk to them,” Wolfish said.
Though students think that finding a roommate online will decrease the stress of rooming with somebody they do not know, some say this is not necessarily true.
Amy Johnson, associate dean of students in the Division of Student Affairs, said that no research proves that students will remain at a university if they select their own roommate rather than having a roommate selected for them by the university.
“Often what you find when students self-select is they choose someone with a lot in common with them or a friend,” Johnson said.
She noted that rooming with friends does not always work out. Johnson said the most important thing is teaching students how to engage in successful relationships with their roommates.
“There’s no magic solution out there or every university would be using it,” she said.
Many students said they feel that finding roommates on Facebook helps prevent a bad first-year experience, but not all students endorse this method.
Shayla Carter, a freshman majoring in international relations, had her roommate chosen randomly by USC Housing. Carter had to switch rooms mid-year because she did not get along with the roommate she had been randomly assigned.
“We didn’t connect very well as people,” Carter said.
Still, Carter said she would prefer having her roommate randomly chosen over using social networking to find somebody.
“I don’t think Facebook is a good indicator because you only put what you want people to know about you,” Carter said, noting that her new roommate was also chosen randomly and they have not had problems.
Freshmen roommates Jennah Blau and Carra Johnson agree. Though they did not pre-select each other, they have had no problems getting along this year.
“I love my roommate and we get along great,” said Carra Johnson, a psychology and human performance major. “I would definitely do random housing again.”

Mock drafts are humorous attempts to satisfy our constant need to predict things. If you want to know how much value they hold, you should not overlook the presence of the word “mock.”
Last year I ran a running diary for the first day of the NFL draft. Because I have the Thursday column this year, I’ll try to outline what should happen in tonight’s first round. Of course, this is not a mock draft since I have no expertise, no inside information and no intent to get any of this right. But if we wanted the most entertaining version of the draft, it would look something like this. And since it’s my version of the draft, we get to fast forward through the boring parts.
Pick 1: St. Louis predictably takes Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford to give the organization some sense of excitement. Of course, knowing the Rams’ luck, Bradford will somehow reinjure his throwing shoulder when NFL commissioner Roger Goodell gives him a vice-grip handshake. Goodell giveth, and Goodell taketh away.
Pick 2: Despite having every intention of messing this pick up, the Detroit Lions take Nebraska defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who becomes the best thing to happen to the city since MoTown. Ford even introduces the new “Ndamukong” model that sells well because everyone thinks it’s a foreign car.
Pick 4: After the Tampa Bay Buccaneers take Oklahoma defensive tackle Gerald McCoy, Washington Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan wants to take Notre Dame player Jimmy Clausen as his quarterback of the future. He is talked out of it when he is assured that he can follow USC’s lead by tabbing a 13-year-old as his “future quarterback of the future.” ESPN microphones inadvertently pick up the sound of Clausen grinding his teeth.
Pick 6: Pete Carroll is ready to make his first draft pick and he demands Washington quarterback Jake Locker, despite the somewhat significant obstacle of Locker not being in this draft. Carroll calls up his old buddy Steve Sarkisian to see if he can make it happen, but the Huskies coach politely declines. Carroll has to settle for Oklahoma tackle Trent Williams.
Pick 7: Cleveland Browns coach Eric Mangini rushes into the war room at the last second, demanding to know when they changed the start of the draft to Thursday night. At the last second, the Browns pick Tennessee safety Eric Berry.
Pick 8: Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger would be a member of the Oakland Raiders in a perfect world, but that probably won’t happen. Because we’re not bound by the silly limitations of reality here, let’s say Oakland owner Al Davis trades this pick and a blank check to Pittsburgh for Roethlisberger. The Steelers immediately select Oklahoma wide receiver Dez Bryant to fill their quota of malcontents.
Pick 9: The Buffalo Bills take Tennessee defensive tackle Dan Williams, who is obviously conflicted about playing in Buffalo. He has a look on his face that says, “The sun still comes out in Buffalo, right guys? Guys?”
Pick 10: Unable to take local legend Tim Tebow this early but still needing to get more fans, the Jacksonville Jaguars take Clemson running back C.J. Spiller. But the Jaguars’ average home attendance next year will still resemble that of a badminton game.
Pick 11: Denver Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels is ecstatic to land Alabama linebacker Rolando McClain. He notes that he looks forward to developing McClain into a Pro Bowl talent before McClain becomes alienated from the team and is traded, just like the rest of the Broncos.
Pick 17: Sending Florida quarterback and colossal conservative Tim Tebow to San Francisco is one of the funniest things I can picture, so let’s do that here. It won’t happen, but the image of Tebow driving a Toyota Prius to the 49ers facility and then having a clam chowder bread bowl for lunch is so very satisfying.
Pick 18: With their other first round pick, Pittsburgh takes Jimmy Clausen to lead a team in dire straits. Welcome back to your first two years at Notre Dame, Jimmy.
Pick 24: Taylor Mays finally comes off the board when the Philadelphia Eagles take him here to a chorus of their fans’ boos. Eagles fans started booing once they heard the phrase “The Philadelphia Eagles select,” so Mays shouldn’t take it personally. He still gives one last call to see if he can find another year of eligibility at USC.

When Shaimaa Abdelhamid received her financial aid package last summer, she was startled by the expected family contribution — $30,000.
Abdelhamid, a junior majoring in history and political science, had recently become financially independent. The Financial Aid Office had determined her family could afford to pay $30,000 toward tuition, but now that she was on her own, Abdelhamid did not know how she was going to come up with the money.
“I’m on my own. Both my parents have filed for bankruptcy in the past couple years, and I can’t afford school unless I get more financial aid,” she said.
Because Abdelhamid isn’t 24 years old, married, supporting someone else, in the military, from an abusive household, an orphan or an emancipated minor, she can’t list herself as an independent on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Independent students tend to earn higher aid awards than regular applicants because their parents’ income is not considered.
It is unclear how many USC students are in the same position as Abdelhamid, but national trends suggest the number of students receiving zero financial support from their parents might be increasing. Schools, meanwhile, continue to calculate financial aid based on the assumption parents are contributing.
“What we’re finding in our surveys is that tuition growth compounded with the economic decline, there’s increasing hesitation from parents to take on debt,” said Peter Mazareas, vice chairman of the College Savings Foundation.
According to the foundation’s 2009 survey, 41 percent of parents have not saved any money for their children’s college education. Another 28 percent said they have saved less than $5,000 per child. Compared to a third of parents in 2008, nearly half of the 778 parents surveyed in 2009 expected their children to pay a third of college costs.
For those like Abdelhamid, whose parents don’t offer any support, filing an appeal is important if initial aid awards seem unfair.
Four days after e-mailing the Financial Aid Office last summer, Abdelhamid received an additional $23,000.
Abdelhamid pooled her new aid award with a $6,000 loan, a $5,000 scholarship from her dad’s employer and federal and state grants to pay tuition. Her $4,000 work-study income covers credit card and cell phone bills. Excess financial aid pays rent.
One junior majoring in political science, who asked to remain anonymous because of privacy concerns, said that except for a loan her parents co-signed when she was 17, she has paid rent, bills and tuition herself. She married her husband last March, carrying $60,000 in debt.
“USC wanted to consider both my parents’ and my husband’s incomes for financial aid [last year], which made no sense whatsoever,” she said. “I was convinced for most of last summer that I wouldn’t be able to finish USC because the Financial Aid Office wouldn’t budge.”
After appealing via e-mail, USC awarded her independent status and increased her aid.
Mazareas said students should feel comfortable appealing because financial aid officers have discretion to amend awards in special circumstances.
“The worst thing a student can do is drop out of a school for financial purposes,” Mazareas said. “They’ll find support if it’s a drastic situation.”
The Financial Aid Office was not available for comment.

The exceptionally strong winds Wednesday knocked a number of branches down around campus. Winds ranged from 20 to 30 mph, occasionally reaching more than 40 mph. A wind advisory was issued for Downtown Los Angeles, as well as other areas in Southern California.

The Eagles is one of those bands that enjoys a permanent spot on everyone’s California road trip playlist. Its sun-kissed classic rock makes listeners want to drive along open roads — top down — while thinking about the love they left back in Los Angeles.
Although the band’s music sometimes traffics in the darker aspects of Los Angeles, the Eagles’ three-night engagement at the Hollywood Bowl was friendly and enjoyable.
Hotel California · The Eagles performed to sold-out crowds at the Hollywood Bowl on Friday, Saturday and Tuesday. The band consists of Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit.  - Genevieve Geoghan | Daily Trojan 
Currently composed of Glen Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit, the Eagles formed in 1971. After recording six studio albums — including Desperado and Hotel California — the band broke up un 1980. In 1994, members reunited to release Hell Freezes Over, a cheeky title for a live album featuring several unreleased studio tracks, and has been touring intermittently ever since.
The band’s long history shows as the Eagles is almost better live than recorded. The guitar solos don’t stray far from what’s been playing on the radio for decades, and the singers’ harmonies are surprisingly beautiful, more so than you might expect from a rock band. It’s those characteristic harmonies that give the Eagles — generally considered a classic rock outfit — its occasional designation as a country band.
The band’s set list was an eclectic compilation of the vast breadth of its career. College students who haven’t been alive to follow the Eagles’ entire career might expect the band to draw heavily from its famous album, Hotel California. The 1976 album has repeatedly been ranked one of the best of all time and was in large part responsible for making the Eagles the most successful rock band of the ’70s.
But the set list was considerably more comprehensive in representing the band’s impressive discography. Throughout the performance, the classic rockers touched on everything from their quintessential Eagles hits to solo works by Don Henley and Joe Walsh.
Throughout the course of the night, the audience heard the Eagles’ quieter sounds in “Take it to the Limit,” then Joe Walsh’s rock ‘n’ roll stylings in “Rocky Mountain Way” and the blaring trumpets of “Funk #49.” The crowd roared for Joe Walsh, the band member who, with his still-shaggy blond hair and too cool black outfit, best embodies the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll.
Because the Hollywood Bowl has a giant screen at the back of its iconic shell, each song was accompanied by a video — some of which were enhanced the performance while others just played into the background.
The black-and-white footage accompanying “Boys of Summer” and the shots of New York playing to the beat of “In the City” were truly beautiful. But other videos were odd, with one in which the band members’ heads were digitally superimposed onto fish. But it was clear that most people in attendance just wanted to listen to music and see the rock legends, with little regard for visuals.
The concert also showcased the band members’ individual work, without distinguishing its original songs from those of its members’ solo careers. The general feeling was that Joe Walsh’s “Life’s Been Good” and Don Henley’s “Dirty Laundry” and “Boys of Summer” were just as much a part of the Eagles repertoire as the band’s original material.
The song integration gave the message that the night was just about celebrating the music the band members had created throughout their lives.
The crowd that came out for the Eagles’ appearance was reflective of the band’s longevity in the music world. The typical fan in attendance was middle-aged, relaxed and there for the music, which was actually refreshing for a concert. Unlike the atmosphere at a performance by a contemporary band like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, there were neither outrageous fashions nor hip scenery to take in.
The crowd was definitely not uptight — it was possible to get a contact high just by breathing. At one point, one of the band members vocalized a revelation during a song break.
“I just smelled this familiar scent wafting up here, and just realized … it’s 4/20,” he said.
Though young people in the audience were hard to spot, there were some wild mommies and daddies at this concert. But, after all, the Eagles are a classic rock band — its primary fan base might not be 19 anymore, but the band’s music has lasted decades by channeling the spirit of California rock ‘n’ roll.

The No. 18 USC women’s tennis team kicks off its postseason push Thursday with a trip to Ojai, Calif., to compete for the 2010 Pac-10 championships.
The Women of Troy (13-9, 5-3) finished Pac-10 action Wednesday morning with a 3-4 loss to No. 12 Stanford (20-1, 8-0). The Women of Troy and the Cardinal were tied at 3-3 in their match-up last month, with doubles play suspended because of rain.
Since the result of the match become a deciding factor in the conference’s determination of the 2010 Pac-10 champion, the teams wrapped up their match before beginning their individual and doubles competitions for the weekend.
But Stanford had the last word and dominated every match. The Cardinal swept all three of USC’s doubles pairs, 8-2, 8-3, 8-2.
Despite being taken down by Stanford, USC has a weekend full of opportunities to defeat some of its Pac-10 foes. Conference individual crowns are on the line in Ojai, with action beginning today and running through the title matches Sunday.
USC has three Women of Troy lined up for the Pac-10 singles championship bracket and another three  playing on the invitational side.
In the mix for the morning’s first-round singles championship play are sophomore Alison Ramos, freshman Valeria Pulido and senior Sarah Fansler. Juniors Cristala Andrews, Lyndsay Kinstler and Leyla Entkehabi will partake in invitational play. Ramos is seeded No. 5 in her draw, while Andrews is seeded No. 4 in her bracket.
In the doubles realm, which kicks off Friday morning, freshman Danielle Lao and teammate Ramos will compete in the Pac-10 doubles championship along with Kinstler and Fansler, and Pulido and Andrews are tabbed for invitational doubles play.
Singles competition at the               Pac-10’s is made up of 32 contestants, and doubles action starts with 16.
Singles and doubles rankings were also released earlier this week, with junior Maria Sanchez leading the way at No. 2 in singles and three other Women of Troy well settled in the nation’s top 125: No. 26 Ramos, No. 30 Lao and No. 103 Pulido.
In doubles, Sanchez is also ranked on three different doubles teams with Lao at No. 46, Kinstler at No. 61 and Pulido at No. 73.
Sanchez, however, will not compete in the individual or doubles tournaments this weekend because of a stress fracture in her ankle that needs rest, but she will be cheering for her teammates on the sideline.
“It’s a great opportunity for them to get a ton of matches in,” Sanchez said.
Despite the excitment, USC still knows there are tests ahead.
“We are very excited to play this weekend,” Pulido said. “Right now we still have plenty to look forward to — we just have to stay motivated.”

Following a disappointing, season-finishing loss to rival No. 12 UCLA, the No. 5 USC men’s tennis team will switch its focus to the Pac-10 championships in Ojai, Calif., which start today.
Move on · Junior Peter Lucassen and the Trojans will look to shake off the aftereffects of a tough loss to UCLA when they begin play Thursday. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The nail-biting 4-3 loss to the Bruins (14-6, 4-2) marked the fourth consecutive year that UCLA has defeated USC (19-3, 5-1) in the season finale.
“I don’t know why,” USC coach Peter Smith said of the current trend against UCLA. “There is always so much put into that match. The more we have lost to them, the more we want to beat them, and it perpetuates itself.”
Although this was an especially painful loss, the Trojans have mentally moved on from the match.
“Our mind-set is fine. We are looking at it like losing any match,” said senior Robert Farah. “This gives us more experience to work harder, and more preparation for the NCAAs. We are not thinking about UCLA.”
The Pac-10 tournament in Ojai marks a shift to individual tennis, which is not always a welcome sight following the pressure-packed dual match season.
“I don’t really like it at this time of the year,” said Smith. “Ojai is such a weird beast. They call it the              Pac-10 championship, but no one treats it like that. It’s time for players who aren’t normally in the lineup to get time to play and time for some players to get rested.”
The Trojans will put forth a full doubles lineup, but will keep some normal singles contributors out of the singles portion.
Sophomore Steve Johnson, junior Jaak Poldma and senior Jason McNaughton will not participate during singles play.
Even with some players sitting out portions of the tournament, the Trojans come in as favorites with Farah and Johnson as the top-seeded doubles team and Farah as the No. 1 seed in the singles draw.
The tournament might not have much bearing on the rest of the season, but the players still enjoy the competition.
“I have always liked the tournament,” Farah said. “It gives you a lot of match experience and helps me prepare for other matches.”
Farah has been successful in Ojai throughout his career.
In 2008, he was a singles finalist, losing to fellow Trojan Kaes Van’t Hof, and won in doubles with Van’t Hof.
The following year, he was a singles semifinalist, losing to eventual tournament winner Bradley Klahn from Stanford.
Smith equates the tournament’s timing to being in a playoff situation and then having to play in an exhibition. Although the tournament’s format and timing is not ideal, that does not mean that the Trojans will put forth diminshed effort.
“We will give 100 percent, and we will take this tournament seriously,” Smith said. “If you win it, you are still the Pac-10 champion, and that is still pretty important.”

The No. 4 USC women’s golf team started strong but faded on its way to a fourth place finish at the Pac-10 Women’s Golf Championship at the Eugene Country Club, in Eugene, Ore.
Quick learner · Freshman Cyna Rodriguez shot a final round 68 to complete the best finish of her young career with the Women of Troy. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The Women of Troy finished one stroke back of eventual winner No. 7 Arizona on the first day of play but dropped to fifth on the second day. After the second round, senior Belen Mozo was disqualified for a rules violation.
“There was a misunderstanding on the first tee as to whether the rule was to play the ball down [playing the ball as it lies] or to life, clean and play [cleaning off the ball and placing it back down before the shot]” said USC coach Andrea Gaston.
Since Mozo played by herself after her playing partner quit because of illness, there was no one to correct her during the round.
“She had to take a two stroke penalty for every time she cleaned it, which would have been ridiculous, or she could take the DQ,” Gaston said.
Her disqualification left the Women of Troy with only four scores left, all of which had to count toward the team’s final tally
Without Mozo’s 75, USC’s lowest round of the day, the team score added in junior Lizette Salas’ 83, putting the Women of Troy into fifth place. In the final round, the Women of Troy had the second lowest team score of the day, boosting the team into a fourth place finish.
USC finished at 27-over-par 891 (284-318-289), 13 strokes behind winner Arizona at 14-over-par 878 (293-297-288).
Had Mozo not been disqualified, the Women of Troy would have finished third, behind Arizona and   No. 2 UCLA, and Mozo would have finished tied for 8th since she would have finished at 4-over-par 220      (72-75-73). Instead, the Women of Troy also finished behind host Oregon.
Though Mozo lost her top-10 finish, sophomore Jennifer Song finished tied for third at 3-over-par 219 (70-76-73), five strokes behind eventual individual winner Carlota Ciganda of No. 1 Arizona State. Song’s finish gives her six top-10 finishes out of the seven tournaments she’s played this season.
Freshman Cyna Rodriguez had her best finish at USC in her first postseason event, tying for 10th at 5-over-par 221 (73-80-68). Rodriguez’s final round was not only her best with the Women of Troy, her 68 was the low score for the entire tournament.
Salas rebounded from her 83 in the second round to finish tied for 23rd at 11-over-par 227 (69-83-75). Her second round was her highest of the season by four strokes. Senior Caroline Kim rounded out the team with a tie for 30th at 17-over-par 233 (76-79-78).
The team has two postseason tournaments remaining, beginning with the NCAA Championship Regionals on May 6 to 8. The location will be determined next week when the NCAA releases seeds, which will be distributed among the regions to make them even.
With travel budgets being restricted, USC will likely end up in the West or the Midwest region. Before then, the Women of Troy have work to do.
“We’re an incredibly talented team, and I have no doubt we have the depth and talent to do so much better than we did,” Gaston said. “But we need more confidence.”

Former USC coach Pete Carroll left for the NFL right as the semester started.
Now, with the spring semester coming to a close, many of the players Carroll mentored during his time at USC will be moving on to the pros as well.
As many as 16 Trojans could be drafted in the NFL’s annual college draft, which begins Thursday at 4:30 p.m. when the St. Louis Rams will be put on the clock with the first overall pick of the draft.
Thursday’s portion will only cover the first round, as the draft has been extended to a three-day event to bring more viewership and interest. Friday will cover the second and third rounds, and the 2010 draft will wrap up with the final four rounds on Saturday afternoon.
USC’s draft class will be hard pressed to live up to 2009’s class, which featured former USC quarterback Mark Sanchez. Sanchez was among many draft prognosticator’s highest-rated prospects and was drafted fifth overall by the New York Jets.
This year’s class is highlighted by four talented professional prospects expected to go in the first two rounds. Safety Taylor Mays was the talk of the NFL combine after running a controversial 40-yard dash and is expected to be drafted near the end of the first round or during the second.
Defensive end Everson Griffen and offensive tackle Charles Brown are also expected to come off the board around that time, as both have demonstrated NFL potential.
Receiver Damian Williams is expected to be selected by the time the second round is complete.
Draft analysts begin to disagree on the later rounds, but other departing Trojans with a good chance of being selected before the end of Saturday include running backs Joe McKnight and Stafon Johnson, tight end Anthony McCoy and defensive backfield specialists Will Harris and Kevin Thomas.
Offensive lineman Alex Parsons, defensive tackle Averell Spicer and safety Josh Pinkard might also be drafted in the latter portions of the draft or could find work in post-draft free agency.
No mention of Jeff Byers.

A group of graduate architecture students are designing a building that could one day become a major landmark in the USC area.
The students have been tasked with creating a plan for a theoretical 60,000-square-foot Emeriti Center for Creative Retirement, which would house retired faculty and staff who want to remain close to the university community.
Former USC President John Hubbard dedicated the Emeriti Center in 1978, making USC among the first universities to recognize the connection with retired faculty and staff and the school itself. The center’s influence has been curbed, however, because of limited space and not enough offices.
The Emeriti Center has moved from various locations over the past 32 years.
“We’ve essentially been guests of the School of Gerontology,” Executive Director Janette Brown said in a press release. “When Victor [Regnier] started talking about what it would be like to have real senior housing and development activities on campus, the vision was just so exciting. We literally spent hours talking about it.”
Regnier is one of the world’s leading authorities on housing for the elderly and a professor of architecture and gerontology. He has worked on similar projects for the University of Virginia and George Mason University. Regnier, along with Michael Lehrer, a nationally renowned architect based in Los Feliz and part-time instructor at USC, is helping the architecture students decide how to best approach the project.
The students are currently considering two potential locations for the project — the corner of McClintock Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard or the corner of Vermont Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard.
Their plan includes 24 housing units for retired faculty, six units of housing to attract faculty from other universities who use their sabbaticals to take or teach courses at USC, meeting rooms for lectures and workshops, a mentoring center and a coffee shop to use as a link between retired faculty, students and the greater community, according to the press release.
The students’ propositions have earned much support from a panel of current and former USC faculty and staff, including former deans Guilbert Hentschke of the USC Rossier School of Education, Bob Scales of the School of Theatre and Bob Harris of the School of Architecture. Other supporters include current USC Davis School of Gerontology Dean Gerald C. Davison, Emeriti Center Executive Director Brown, USC Davis School professor Jon Pynoos and Jerry Walker, director of the Emeriti Center College, according to the release.
Whether or not any of these designs will actually come to fruition remains to be seen.
Kristina Raspe, USC’s associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management, commended the students on their efforts and designs. She noted, however, that the university’s main priority is to fit buildings with academic purposes, so it is rather unlikely that any of their designs will be erected on the core campus.
“A lot of these creative ideas have a great deal of merit and serve to benefit the community in tremendous ways,” Raspe said. “There were many unique ideas and I was most interested in the ones that work with space outside of USC’s core campus and build a connection with the surrounding area.”

The other day I was listening to some friends discuss how to get around USC’s ban on peer-to-peer file-sharing. One advocated simply going off-campus and finding another Internet connection, but the other talked about creating a program to go around USC’s firewalls that would allow him to download songs from the comfort of his dorm room.
While the conversation might have seemed innocuous to them, it made me realize how far hacking has come from subculture to mainstream practice, and how much hacking has contributed to the Internet and technological revolution.
When I asked another friend what he thought of when I said “hacker,” his first thought was Keanu Reeves in The Matrix — a cyberpunk-minded loner in black leather cracking into government systems and living by his own rules.
Sadly, that’s still how most people see hackers.
But the computer hackers of today are more likely to be in obscure pop culture-referencing T-shirts than black leather and more interested in modifying and amplifying their computer’s power than crippling government servers.
Yes, cyber warfare is on the rise, and it’s always good to have a strong firewall system, but these are not the people to be afraid of — these are the people to listen to.
The truth is that while some have used computer hacking for evil, it has mostly led to progress and innovation.
At its simplest level, hacking is improvising unexpected and ingenious ways of getting a more efficient system. When it comes to computers, it means people are constantly modifying and tweaking their hardware and writing new code for programs, using the existing material as a baseline for new improvements.
Just because hacking might not be liked by institutions in power, that does not mean some shady computer skills or an interest in hacking tactics can’t revolutionize how we use the Internet.
Take file-sharing, for instance. The Recording Industry Artists Association criticizes it, but it has done immense wonders for networking and communication. When programs like Napster started, the Internet was still new. These programs linked computers together in ways that had never been imagined before, and because of that, we now have extensions of that idea in social networking sites.
Even The Pirate Bay — an infamous file-sharing website — had an influence. While based in one country, it would put its servers in less restrictive countries to avoid being prosecuted or shut down. This became a model for other sites that might otherwise face persecution. Websites like WikiLeaks and other endangered sites use this global, decentralized method today.
What makes these people so effective is a do-it-yourself attitude and a desire to create more efficient, freer technology and software for the people.
They are the vanguard of an open source movement. They take what has been previously limited and closed off and open it up the masses, taking an idea and then increasing its potential. If something is a good concept, they build upon it and share it. That is why the Internet is how it is today.
If you doubt the influence of these hackers on the Internet, look no further than the heads of major web companies. Kevin Rose, who got his start on TechTV as the “Dark Tipper,” founded Digg.com. Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook from his dorm room after a series of programming experiments. Jack Dorsey had been an open source programmer who took his interest in writing code to create Twitter.
Even the major companies were started by some of the earliest computer hackers. Bill Gates was once trying to engineer computers for more performance by taking them apart and putting them back together with a few tweaks. The results became the programs that would define Microsoft. The same is true for Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Thanks to their tinkering, we have many of the technological amenities we use today.
The way things are going, the future of the Internet lies within those who are willing to go outside the standards and try something new. The innovators are the people who want to customize their technology for better results. With each day, there is more evidence that we, college students, are those pioneers. We are the ones who are going to continue to revolutionize the online world.
Should everyone get off their e-mail and start trying to crack the Defense Department codes? No. This isn’t Wargames, and we aren’t Matthew Broderick. However, nothing new ever comes from remaining static. If it takes unconventional means to do it, what is the big deal? It might be shady, it might be unexpected, and it might even violate a few codes of conduct, but it’s all in the name of progress.

USC students have been complaining about the school dining choices for years. We complain about the quality of the food in the dining halls, and the lack of variety. We complain about the scarcity of vegetarian and healthy choices, the price, the limited hours of dining areas and the inadequate transportation to off-campus restaurants.
Delish · Slice Truck’s plain cheese pizza (top) is garnished with grated parmesan and fresh basil. Bull Kogi’s Korean taco features kimchi bulgogi tacos piled high with traditional fermented cabbage. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
Students can now save their breath, however, because a wide range of dining options have been rolling up to the fringes of campus.
The rise of food trucks is nothing new. But recently, more and more mobile eateries have become regular caterers to our school after finding a decent fan base among selection-deprived students.
College students are the perfect customers for food trucks. Hungry from hours of lectures, they lack the demand for fancy gourmet food that comes with polished service. As long as the eats are cheap, delicious and accessible, students are happy.
New to the idea or unfamiliar with what’s out there? The following are a selection of the most commonly seen food trucks around our campus. So hop on over and chow down.
Bull Kogi
If you’re food truck-savvy, you probably have already guessed that Bull Kogi is an imitator of the original Kogi food truck created by chef Roy Choi, the brain behind the fusion of Korean condiments and Mexican tacos. Even the truck and logos look similar. Given the success of the Kogi truck, such imitation is not a surprise. But since the Kogi truck seldom visits the USC area, Bull Kogi will have to do.
The food is also similar to Kogi’s. The menu is simple: beef, pork, chicken, shrimp or tofu served in either taco, burrito, rice bowl or quesadilla form.
The kimchi bulgogi tacos are the popular item here and for good reason. The beef is well marinated with a hint of sweetness, and is also tender and flavorful. Despite the fact that it is called a kimchi bulgogi taco, however, there were only scant, tiny slivers of kimchi.
Health-conscious students can rejoice because Bull Kogi piles on the traditional sesame cabbage heavier than the meat itself. But those who crave protein might need to order several more tacos to satisfy their carnivorous desires.
Slice Truck
Pizza on a truck is not the most creative idea and the menu is very limited, but the Slice Truck really does know how to make good pizza. Its concept is based on simplicity, and with a good, thin, crispy crust, a wonderfully fresh sauce and real grated Parmesan cheese and fragrant herbs, you don’t need fancy ingredients to enjoy a truly satisfying pizza.
At $2.50 to $5 per slice, you get a fair amount for your buck, too. With a large pizza coming in at 18 inches wide, Slice Truck’s slices are 65 percent larger than the average delivery slice of a large pizza. If you’re sick of cheese and pepperoni, they also have a specialty of the day, such as hot garlic, which comes smelling incredibly and wondrously pungent. Avoid it on a date, but otherwise, it’s a garlic-lover’s dream come true.
Lee’s Philly Gogi
Lee’s Philly Gogi serves up Korean-fusion in more than just tacos. It serves Korean-style Philly cheesesteaks, hoagies and burritos, too. But why order a taco from a truck called Philly? Stick to the cheesesteaks and you won’t be disappointed.
The Gogi Philly Cheesesteak is probably the most popular item here, but if you can handle spice, try the Gogi Spicy Chicken Cheesesteak too. The sandwich costs a little more than $6 with tax, and the size is equivalent to a foot-long Subway sandwich. It even comes with a small cup of creamy potato salad.
This sandwich does not skimp on the filling. Stuffed with flavorful, Korean barbecue meat sautéed with onions, and with the hot gooey cheese melted in the middle, it’ll win over the staunchest cheesesteak connoisseurs.
You also get a social treat by ordering from this truck. The owner is incredibly friendly, and he happily chats with all his customers, telling them that his sandwich is the best out of all the other trucks. That’s for you to decide, but his obvious pride and passion in his product is pleasantly infectious.
India Jones Chow Truck
India Jones is not for the faint-hearted. If you want hot, intense, greasy grub food, this is the truck for you. Usually wraps are considered lighter, weight-friendly fare, but those you find here are not diet food in the least and the flavors are anything but bland.
For starters, the wraps are called Frankies ($3.50 each), and their outer layers are made of a pan-fried dough-based pancake called roti, which are then filled with cilantro-tamarind chutney, onions, egg and your choice of either sautéed lamb, chicken, beef, shrimp, paneer or mushroom and cheese.
Wraps are fixed within minutes and served piping hot. The chutney is tangy, bold and mouth-watering, and the roti is crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with a faint egg-y taste. The whole thing is greasy, but not intolerably so.
With a similar dough to the Frankie but stuffed instead of wrapped, the Paratha ($3.50) comes filled with either aloo (potato curry), gobhi (cauliflower) or kemma (minced beef) and is served with some tangy yogurt raita as a cooling counterpart.
India Jones Chow Truck also serves traditional Indian fare such as butter chicken and assorted curries, but those have generally received fewer raves than the Frankies and Parathas. When it comes to this truck, have an adventurous spirit, and expect something unfamiliar, yet delicious.
Phamish Food Truck
So far, the food truck options have been pretty greasy, but you can still maintain a healthy diet while helping yourself to the offerings of mobile eateries near campus. Phamish is a Vietnamese food truck that sells fresh spring rolls (goi cuon), hot rice noodle soups (pho) and French-Vietnamese baguette sandwiches (banh mi).
Given that summer is fast approaching, the spring rolls and the sandwiches are the best bets. The banh mi comes in grilled steak, lemongrass pork, lemongrass chicken or vegetarian tofu, and prices range between $5 to $7.
The baguette is the best component of this sandwich — long and skinny, it has a crispy crust and chewy interior that makes for a perfect balance of bread and filling. The lemongrass pork is tender, but needs a bit more seasoning. But the garlic mayonnaise and the fresh pickled carrots, daikon (Asian radish), cilantro and jalapeño more than make up the lack of intensity in the meat.
For those looking for a low-carb version of this sandwich, the spring rolls come with similar filling options, just wrapped in a thin, clear rice wrapper. It’s stuffed with other ingredients like lettuce, cucumber, pickled carrots and daikon, bean sprouts, fresh mint and basil, and with a dipping sauce on the side. Basically, it is a summer salad wrap, with refreshing and clean flavors and textures.
Ha! Sophia Lee rules.  Best food-truck review Ever.

“We are going to do that,” President Barack Obama said to impatient members of GetEQUAL at Exposition Park on Monday. “Hey, hold on a second … We are going to do that.”
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Obama was trying to calm civil rights protesters who were disappointed — and aggravated — by the way his administration has been dragging its feet in repealing the U.S. military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.
“Let me say this — when you’ve got an ally [like me] … then you don’t know exactly why you’ve got to holler because [I] already hear you,” Obama said. “I mean, it would have made more sense to holler that at the people who oppose it.”
Perhaps they’re hollering because, despite all the promises, nothing’s really been done yet.
The controversial DADT policy is the brainchild of a military compromise during the Clinton era; after being overpowered by Congress and the military in his efforts to allow gays to legally serve in the armed forces, Clinton had to settle for “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which prevents the military from actively trying to reveal the sexual orientations of soldiers.
Serve our country. But stay in the closet.
Obama pledged to abolish the policy during his campaign, and more recently in his 2010 State of the Union address, allowing gays to enlist without having to hide their sexual orientation. But months later, no action has been taken outside of a study asking the military to find the best way of changing the policy, and restrictions allowing only higher-ranking officers to dismiss gay soldiers from duty. There is no congressional amendment in the Pentagon budget bill, no moratorium on the policy as it stands now and not even a specific timetable for what will be accomplished and when.
Meanwhile, forcibly outed gay military personnel continue to be discharged just as soon as their sexual orientation can be confirmed.
Obama is not entirely remiss to take things slowly before pulling the plug on a military policy that has stood firm for 17 years. He could repeal the policy with an executive order at any moment, but, understandably, he wants a comprehensive plan of reform, with everyone on board. But by stepping back and letting Congress and the Pentagon take the lead so as not to anger the military, he is also allowing the issue to be tied up, possibly indefinitely, in red tape and vague legislation.
The military wants to take about a year to review the best way to implement the repeal. Congress most likely won’t act until that study is complete. Between the passing of the anti-DADT legislature, which won’t take place overnight, and the actual implementation of the changes, gay military personnel will likely have to continue to play it straight, or else be immediately discharged, until well in to 2012.
It’s not that people think Obama will go back on his word. But the window for reform could be closing faster than anticipated; in November, the 2010 midterm elections will take place. If nothing decisive has been done by then, and if, as expected, Republicans gain more seats in Congress, the repeal could very well be blocked by a strong conservative opposition. Clinton couldn’t fight it in 1993, and it’s a legitimate concern that Obama won’t be able to either.
What the Obama administration needs, both to satiate the critics and overcome the Republicans in Congress, is to begin taking action now. If an executive order is not around the corner, there are a number of progressive steps that are the next best thing.
The military study could be allowed six months instead of a year. Obama could lobby Congress for an amendment in the Pentagon budget bill. Most beneficial to the gay men and women in active duty, Obama could call for a moratorium on DADT, which would prevent additional sexual orientation-based discharges until the issue has been studied more thoroughly.
Above all, Obama should set an exact date by which DADT will finally, as promised, be gone. No more non-specific claims of “we are going to do that.”
“President Obama has been AWOL on DADT,” said LGBT activist Dan Fotou in a press release. “We had to remind him of the promises he made to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community during his campaign and several times during his presidency — that DADT will be repealed because, as he’s stated, ‘It’s the right thing to do.’”
“Don’t ask, don’t tell” is a complex issue. It’s difficult to foresee the exact impact its repeal will have on our military, and how extensive an impact that will have on the gay community in turn.
But DADT is a policy that prevents all citizens of the United States from being able to express their identities fully and equally. In the end, a promise was made to repeal it, and soon.
We should be taking the necessary steps to keep that promise.

Won’t having gays in our military be insensitive to Muslims or something?
Seriously… if flaming homos are allowed to stay in the military, how will cowards on the Left be able to dodge the draft if we find ourselves in another major war?
Oh Joe, you’re just hilarious. Unfortunately, you’re missing the point. This isn’t about draft dodging; this is about perfectly eligible people who want to be in the military but can’t because of an attribute that does not affect their ability to be effective soldiers. If you want more people in the military, then you should be for repealing DADT.
I disagree with you on the premise that men buggering other men is an “attribute”, but even if it was, gays CAN be in the military. DADT explicitly allows them to serve in the military, and requires nothing more than the same discretion that should be expected of any professional man in uniform.
DADT does not require straight people in uniform to hide their sexual orientation; it does require this of gay people in uniform. The law does not merely apply to “buggering,” which should be kept private in any case, but also any mention of a gay soldier’s significant other (because, of course, that would indicate his or her sexual orientation). How would you feel if you were putting your life on the line for your country but were required by law to lie about who were and to avoid acknowledging the existence of your wife or girlfriend? Gay and straight service members are not treated equally under DADT.

California’s budget is a mess. In the coming year, the government expects to face a $14.4 billion gap between spending and revenue. In order to combat this veritable canyon, the government has been cutting spending in a variety of areas, from education to the arts. However, fixing the deficit is not only a matter of spending less: It is a matter of spending smarter.
That is precisely why the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s plan to hike public transportation fares is a mistake. Although dire economic times might make the decision seem smart, the hikes will not bring in revenue. In fact, they are likely to backfire.
The hike will go into effect July 1. At first glance, it does not look substantial: A one-way pass will go from $1.25 to $1.50, a daily pass will go from $5 to $6, and a monthly pass will go from $62 to $75. However, when examining these numbers, one must take the income of the typical transit user into account. On average, people who make the most use of public transportation make $12,000 to $17,000 a year, according to the Los Angeles Times. The 2009 Federal Poverty Guidelines states that a family of three surviving on that kind of income is well below the poverty line — not to mention families larger than this.
What’s more, the monthly passes will experience the greatest fee hike. A typical transit user is likely to buy a monthly pass, the more prudent alternative to buying numerous one-way passes. Although all passes increase by a uniform 17 percent, in the case of the monthly pass, that increase translates into an extra $13 a month. For someone making minimum wage, $13 is no joke — it’s the result of nearly two hours of work. The hike hurts the socioeconomic class that needs the money the most.
Moreover, the numbers show that even relatively modest fee hikes could translate into people skimping on trips.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the MTA says one of its biggest problems is a decline in ridership. But if fewer people are able to use public transportation, fewer dollars will flow into the MTA. For example, people already have an incentive to ride the Metro without paying because they generally know they won’t get caught. Wouldn’t a fee increase only add to that incentive?
Simply put, the hike has the potential to be extremely counterproductive.
The hike could also drive Los Angeles farther down the path of eco-unfriendliness. Groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, Los Angeles Bicycle Coalition, Coalition for Clean Air, Transportation for America Campaign and California Public Interest Research Group have all opposed it.
They have good reason.
Residents who avoid public transportation — even those who are environmentally conscious — call it unpleasant and less reliable than owning a car. If an already-flawed system starts costing more, the motivation to use it becomes even smaller.
Although L.A. streets are already the source of much pollution, rising public transportation fees will encourage people who might have considered relying on public transportation to disregard it as a plausible option.
As if traffic isn’t bad enough already.
Perhaps California should try cutting where it doesn’t hurt groups that are already hurting. Anything from increased advertising to cutting out the small televisions present on many buses could help.
It’s a matter of creative problem solving — something the government needs to learn a thing or two about.

The USC south area Residential Education staff, which covers Pardee Tower, Trojan Hall, Marks Hall and Marks Tower residence halls, is currently hosting Alcohol Awareness Week, a week full of activities that will educate students about alcohol safety.
On Sunday, the residential staff kicked off the week with a barbecue social. Students discussed alcohol- and drug-related issues in order to educate themselves about being safe at parties and social events. Wednesday’s event welcomed a speaker from UCLA who had a near-death experience with drunk driving. Today, students will have a chance to win an iPod nano or shuffle by answering Jeopardy-style questions regarding alcohol.
These events have a noble message for students, but the issue with alcohol awareness is that many students fail to apply those lessons to their lives. The facts are great, but what students choose to do with those facts is the deciding factor between life and death.
Tuesday’s speaker, Prison Break actor Lane Garrison, told the story of how his life, as well as the lives of three other families, changed after he crashed his car while driving under the influence of alcohol.
“The hope for this event is to educate students regarding alcohol awareness and to empower them to, if they do so choose to partake in alcohol [consumption], to do so safely,” said Kat Jawaharlal, a graduate student studying public diplomacy and the resident coordinator of Marks Hall.
In 2006, Garrison attended a party with a few high school students he had met one night at Ralphs and ended up killing one of the students in his car because of his decision to drink and drive.
“Everything happened within 19 minutes from the store the first time, to going to the party drinking [two] shots, people getting back in my car, going to the store to get more alcohol,” he said. “I took a sharp turn and my car flipped over, and the young man in the front seat of my car died.”
After Garrison’s tragic experience with drunk driving, his perception on drunk driving changed.
But what I do not understand is why people need a near-death experience or the death of another to convince them that drinking and driving is a bad idea.
Deb Berman | Daily Trojan
What does it take to make people understand the risks and dangers of drinking and driving? Why must people resort to hurting others or themselves to refrain from getting behind the wheel after drinking?
Garrison said he felt he was invincible because of his good character and care for the people around him.
“My perception was ‘Nothing bad is going to happen because I’m a good person.’ I don’t wish harm on anybody,” he said. “So my perception led me to that arrogance of ‘Oh, I’m fine to drink and drive. I can handle that. Nothing bad will happen. I’m a good person.’”
Despite programs and lectures given from elementary to high school, students’ knowledge about and attitudes toward drunk driving often seems passive.
According to Shashwat Patel, a sophomore majoring in accounting and business administration, his definition of drunk driving is “having more than two drinks within an hour and then driving.” However, by law, people under 21 years of age cannot drive with any amount of alcohol in their system. Also, Garrison’s experience proves that two drinks are enough to impair your reflexes.
“I can have more than two drinks, and I probably won’t be drunk. I think I can have more than the legal definition of drunk and still not be drunk,” Patel said.
The perception students have of invincibility is frightening because they believe they can overcome a challenge thousands of others have already proven dangerous and often fatal.
“Theoretically, you’re not allowed to drive [under 21 years of age]. I’ve done it once,” said Allison Dorr, a sophomore majoring in international relations. “I don’t think it’s the safest thing I’ve ever done, and I wouldn’t want to ever do it again.”
The key to preventing drunk driving is to realize that even one drink can impair your judgment and reflexes. That one drink draws the line between safety and danger, life and death. So stop thinking about how many drinks you can hold in your system before it is unsafe to drive, and make the decision not to get behind the wheel after having one drink. Better safe than sorry.
Take it from someone whose life turned upside down and who forever affected the lives of one teenager’s family and friends when he chose to get behind the wheel after drinking.
“Call a cab. Call your parents. Call a friend. Take away someone’s keys. Do whatever it takes,” Garrison said. “Don’t drink and drive. It’s not worth it.”

@ Joe
I think Henirich is saying that, to tell youths to abstain from alcohol consumption is unrealistic. They’re gonna do it regardless. So, instead of looking at things in a black or white manner, it’s better to educate them in a realistic, pragmatic manner by saying it’s OK to consume in moderation and with restraint. To tell kids, “hell no, you better not consume 1 drop of alcohol or else you’ll become an alcoholic; kill someone in a drunk driving accident,” etc. is not going to work. 
It’s just like telling kids about the birds and the bees. They’re gonna do it when those hormones rage. 
To repudiate issues, or to try to scare people with extreme scare tactics is downright silly.
This article is well intentioned, but I think there is a larger issue being ignore here and that is this sort  abstinence education approach to alcohol in America. I truly believe that we are not going to see drunk driving and other alcohol related deaths decrease until we start teaching teenagers how to responsibly handle alcohol before they begin college. 
True, the drinking age discourages this, but any reasonable parent must know that their children will more than likely be drinking after leaving and it is their responsibility to ensure that their kids have had some experience in handling alcohol before heading out into the world. Maybe it’s not legal to let a 16 or 17 year old try wine or beer in a controlled setting, but it’s much safer than simply teaching theoretical “alcohol awareness” and assuming that kids will put the lessons into wise choices. There’s no way to determine how a person will make drinking choices until the drink is in their hands.
Yeah, nothing teaches kids about responsibility better than their parents telling them “go on, drink it, it’s no big deal!”

On the day before he was scheduled to give his deposition for alleged benefits received while at USC, former running back Reggie Bush settled his civil lawsuit.
Bush will pay an undisclosed sum to Lloyd Lake of New Era Sports & Entertainment, the plaintiff in the suit.
The settlement closes a four-year saga for Bush, who was accused of receiving $300,000 worth of benefits illegally during his time at USC.
The implications of his actions expanded to affect the whole USC athletic department, too. Currently, USC is waiting to hear from an NCAA committee on the results of a hearing about eigh weeks ago that investigated potential violations by the school with regard to Bush and former basketball player O.J. Mayo.
When it was announced that Bush was to be deposed, many suspected that the committee would wait until Bush spoke before releasing the sanctions. Now that he has come to a settlement agreement, the sanctions are likely forthcoming.
The settlement marks the second accord that Bush has been a part of with respect to his supposed violations. In April 2007, Bush paid between $200,000 and $300,000 to Michael Michaels, another New Era partner, to avoid trial.

Spring has spring and Green Day’s song licensing team is busy.
It’s been exactly 20 years since the Operation Ivy-inspired East Bay San Francisco punk band released its first EP, 39/Smooth, and yet it continues to skyrocket itself further into the rock-commercialist stratosphere with more lucrative multi-media endeavors than any other act on the market.
Last week, Reverb Games shot Green Day into the same new media pantheon as the Beatles, Aerosmith and Metallica by announcing the 47-song track listing for its upcoming band-centric video game Green Day: Rock Band. Even though the press release promised a “setlist featuring songs from the iconic punk band’s career,” it instead pulled tracks from three Green Day albums, only one of which (Dookie) was released during its still-underground days of the mid-90s.
Furthering this trend of using the band’s alternative past to promote its mainstream present is the Green Day musical. American Idiot — which was originally performed at a small repertory in Berkely, Calif. two years ago — opened on Broadway in New York City last night.
Based on Green Day’s 2004 politically inspired concept album of the same name, American Idiot pieces together the sonic story of a protagonist named Jesus of Suburbia who, according to the band’s vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong, represents “a new generation of Americans as they struggle to find meaning in a post 9/11 society.”
Following in the thread of the 1993 production of Who’sTommy, the rock opera keeps the album as intact as possible — depressing story arc, heroin-injection scenes and all — while spreading it across a large cast and incorporating visual cues.
So while organizing choreography for songs from your punk manifesto might sound a little sacreligious, for a band like Green Day (references to the color of money aside), it’s all in a year’s work.
