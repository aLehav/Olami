This was not supposed to be the subject of this week’s column. A week ago, I was prepared to write about the end of California’s legislative session. My barbs and criticisms were being polished, and though I was deeply disappointed by the legislative failures I intended to write about, I was looking forward to excoriating the negligence of our state representatives in today’s paper. 
Instead, in a manner that feels horrifically metaphoric, the reality outside my window has forced me to change course. By the time this column is published, California’s wildfires will have burned more than 3 million acres, forced 64,000 residents to evacuate their homes, and killed at least 26 people — all while turning the skies a sickly orange and gray. 
These fires were, in many respects, foreseeable. Yes, the lightning storms that sparked fires across the state were rare, but the vulnerability of the land it struck — more specifically, a landscape that had been rendered into highly flammable kindling by a historic heatwave — was well understood. 
In other words, the wildfires were predictable and those in power (corporate executives and politicians) knew that their actions would only exacerbate crises like the one Californians face today. 
Internal documents from the fossil fuel industry have repeatedly indicated that the industries’ scientists and corporate executives were well aware of the disastrous heatwaves and droughts their products would cause. Scientists working for the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration during the 1960s warned of the “deleterious” effects of carbon dioxide on climate change and, since then, a near unanimous consensus among scientists has formed affirming the role of human activity in climate change. 
And yet, despite decades of this growing consensus, one dwindling but powerful faction of Americans chooses to remain wilfully ignorant: Republicans. In a 2019 Pew Research study, only 14% of Republicans surveyed agreed that human activity contributes a “great deal” to climate change, compared to 84% of their Democratic counterparts. Similar levels of partisan ignorance were echoed in the United States Congress, where 129 of the 130 legislators who denied or doubted climate change were Republican. 
This ignorance, a childlike compulsion to hold on to a repeatedly disproven conviction no matter how much evidence mounts to disprove it, lies at the center of all that is wrong with the United States.
In the U.S., human contributions to climate change are often met with denial despite the fact that approximately 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities play a crucial role. In a similar vein, many also deny the existence of systemic racism despite 400 years of evidence to the contrary. We falsely maintain a righteous facade of democracy while three out of the U.S.’s four political power centers — the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, presidency and Supreme Court — are led by a party that the majority of Americans did not vote for. We declare that this is the greatest country in the world even though we lag far behind developed peer nations in almost every meaningful metric, from success and education to happiness and health.
And now, violent and hellish wildfires are here to remind us once again of our fatal ignorance. 
I realize that some may find issues with this premise. After all, California is a state that bleeds blue, with a Democratic governor and a legislature largely controlled by the same party. But California, for all of its progressive leanings and zeal for green policies, cannot fend off the destruction of climate change if the rest of the country buries its head in the sand and denies the scourge’s existence. 
In the words of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California can make all the investments it wants in firefighters, clean energy and expensive infrastructure, but until the federal government takes action to reverse the course of climate change, climate catastrophes will be an annual fixture for years to come. 
Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, none of this is new. The science has been widely available and accepted for decades. As recently as 2019, the U.S. Army issued a report in which it warned that Americans could soon witness the climate change-induced collapse of the nation’s domestic power, water and food systems. Blackouts, disease, starvation, thirst and war might become the norm and the U.S. military itself might crumble, the report stated. 
Still, our president largely chooses to ignore this glaring reality. For three weeks, as lives were destroyed and the fires raged on, President Donald Trump failed to acknowledge the crisis publicly. After nearly four years of watching Trump roll back environmental protections, however, no one in their right mind can reasonably say they are surprised by the administration’s negligence.
I could conclude with another scathing line about the president or some policy proposal that is most likely already being considered. However, as smoke and ash fill the air and force us into our homes, I don’t think there exists a more appropriate, eloquent conclusion than the following snippet, pulled from a recent article in The Atlantic: 
“We’re trapped inside because of the pandemic and because of the fires, but ultimately we are most confined by the inequality, selfishness, and greed that created this moment,” Emma Marris wrote. “Even in the wide-open West, we’re still stuck in the United States of America.”

This year’s presidential election will be unlike any other. The virtualization of the two campaigns due to the coronavirus crisis is a large part of this assertion, but even more pressing is the level of fabrication and legal maneuvering being carried out, specifically at the hands of President Donald Trump’s administration. Unprecedented rhetoric and actions by the president and his campaign highlight the need for improved civics education to ensure that no American can be easily fooled by a leader’s abuse of power.
From claiming there will be wild amounts of voter fraud and suing states such as Nevada to stop them from sending mail-in ballots to all registered voters to using his executive power to slow down the postal service and suggesting that North Carolinians should vote twice, the president is doing what he can to tilt this election in his favor with underhanded methods, some never seen before.
It traditionally benefits Republicans if less of the population votes and that is exactly what Trump is attempting to achieve. Sadly, a lot of his remarks are meant to cast doubt over the sanctity of the election in case it does not go his way, and his constant allusions to election fraud strongly suggest that he will challenge the results of a losing election.
 The problem does not stop with threats to voting rights. The president’s borderline tactics carry over to general campaigning, as he broke precedent by using the White House as the setting for his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.
Although this is legal as the president is exempt from the Hatch Act (a 1939 law prohibiting federal employees from engaging in forms of political activity), Republicans violated the Hatch Act several other times throughout the convention by using their government powers for political gain. This included televising a naturalization ceremony, a presidential pardon and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo making his speech while on a diplomatic trip to Israel.
Casting doubt on an election, taking measures to make it more difficult to vote and using government positions to help win a supposedly “free and fair” election does not sound remotely like the great democracy the United States is.
The onus is on Americans to ensure that this election year does not spiral into further deterioration of our democratic republic. To help our populace be more educated and aware of their rights and the fundamental principles of a democracy, there should be a larger emphasis on civics education in schools, from elementary school through college. Learning civics is an important step toward becoming an aware, active participant in U.S. democracy and all school districts, private schools and colleges should see it as imperative to helping their students develop into contributing members of society. 
A consistent dose of civics classes starting at a young age and continuing every few years rather than the usual throwaway class in high school will help ingrain the importance of democracy and democratic tools such as voting and protesting. This will help the American people be better equipped to recognize potential threats or attacks on our democracy and know how to adequately address them.
Stronger civics education would help people understand the dangers presented when a presidential administration commits itself to keeping some Americans from voting or abuses its power for political gain. At the moment, these moves seem fairly unchecked, although the results of this election will show whether that is really the case. Regardless of the results, this election year has brought our democracy to a crossroads and it is our duty as U.S. citizens to learn about, understand and protect our democracy.

Earlier this month, a notification popped up on my phone with the headline “Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are donating $300 million dollars to increase voting efforts.” After reading this headline, it seems logical to applaud billionaires for donating their money to important issues. We might reason that money is money, and it should not matter who it is coming from. 
Like most things in this world, however, it’s not quite that simple. Unmitigated support for mega-philanthropy disregards how billionaires make their money in the first place and also ignores the disproportionate power such philanthropy yields for the upper echelons of society.
The $300 million donation to promote safe and reliable voting processes during this election is the perfect example of the hypocrisy inherent within billionaire philanthropy. 
Zuckerberg’s near $100 billion net worth did not appear out of nowhere, but instead came as a direct result of his position as the co-founder and CEO of Facebook. Despite his apparent support for improving the voting process, Zuckerberg has faced criticism for failing to address misinformation about the upcoming election and for allowing politicians to run false advertisements on Facebook. Zuckerberg donates money to the very problem that he refuses to solve on his own platform. This Catch-22 is not unique to Zuckerberg. 
In 2018, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, pledged $2 billion to fighting homelessness in the United States. Ironically, at the same time as his donation, there were reports of Amazon warehouse workers sleeping outside in tents due to their minimal wages. Additionally, Amazon had recently led the fight against a tax on big businesses in Seattle meant to provide aid to combat the homelessness crisis. 
In his book “Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,” Anand Giridharadas delves deeper into the hypocrisy shown by both Zuckerberg and Bezos, along with many others like them. Uber-wealthy mega-philanthropists, he argues, gain power through this current system, and therefore have no interest in breaking that system. Instead, through philanthropy, they put bandages on problems without contributing to lasting change — always doing more good and never less bad.
Mega-philanthropists also use money to gain influence and power in fields they lack expertise. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who is often lauded for his incredible accomplishments through philanthropy, is not immune to this criticism.
I know this is where there might be a slight pause for some readers, for Gates is often heralded as the example of how billionaires should act. It may be a lot easier to see problems with figures like Bezos but feel conflicted with someone like Gates. 
I am the first to admit that things are not black and white. In the following criticism of Gates, I am not negating some of the accomplishments of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through their international work, The Gates Foundation improved accessibility of modern contraception for women and distributed vaccines for diseases such as malaria, among other key advances. I believe I can praise his work while simultaneously recognizing that mega-philanthropy is problematic. 
In Washington, a referendum on opening public charter schools in the state was rejected by voters in 1996, 2000 and 2004. In 2012, when the referendum returned, Gates put more than $3 million behind it. A broad coalition opposed the ballot measure, but did not have the same financial backing as Gates and the other billionaires that supported the schools. Gates and other philanthropists outspent their opponents 12 to one, and finally managed a victory of 50.69% in favor and 49.31% opposed. 
In 2015, the Washington Supreme Court deemed the new charter school law unconstitutional. Charter activists funded by Gates responded by creating a PAC that channeled money to legislators willing to vote for a modified law. In 2018, the Washington Supreme Court finally ruled charter schools constitutional.
In other words, despite citizens of Washington resoundingly voting against charter schools multiple times, Gates, simply because of his money, was able to push forward his opinion on the issue at the expense of others. The ability for mega-philanthropy to amplify the voice of a handful of people, at seeming odds with the democratic process, raises concerns, especially when considering that having an abundance of money does not make a person an expert in education policy. 
I am not trying to argue we should stop donating to nonprofits. The real issue arises when billionaires performatively donate hundreds of millions to a problem that they have a hand in causing. Or when billionaires, under the guise of philanthropy, exert unmatched power and control over complicated, nuanced issues.
If we by and large agree with a billionaire’s causes, there might be less hesitation in giving them power and influence over the direction of our society. But what happens when a billionaire uses his or her resources to steer the country in ways the majority doesn’t agree with?
The next time we see a headline about a billionaire who donated millions of dollars to a cause, it is important to think about the impact and intention of the donation in a critical context before offering unequivocal praise. Not to mention, we should think long and hard about whether we want to abdicate the democratic process to a handful of individuals with the monetary resources to shape the world, and our country, specifically, as they see fit.

In the early days of lockdown, Richelle Gribble sat in her bedroom staring out of the window as so many others were doing around the world. In that moment, she related her experience to an astronaut gazing through the window of the International Space Station down at Earth.
Gribble, a Los Angeles-based artist and USC Roski graduate, realized how the world remained interconnected despite the physical separation brought on by the pandemic. She realized she was not alone in this feeling after connecting with her friend Isabel Beavers, another L.A.-based artist and educator, and discovering they shared the same perspective. They talked about how peculiar it was that the coronavirus pandemic united the global population in isolation.
The conversation about global connectivity inspired The Great Pause Project, an online open-source collection of photos and written materials that document individual responses to the coronavirus pandemic. The two artists, in collaboration with Elena Soterakis, a Brooklyn-based artist and co-founder of BioBAT Art Space, recognized the need for them as artists to act quickly and develop a project that allowed people from around the world to submit their experiences and process the situation.
“[We wanted to just have] a repository of all these different experiences and [amplify] an individual voice — and not just the voice that you see on mainstream media and TV,” Soterakis said, “but the really beautiful and interesting stories that were coming up for individuals — and [capture] that.”
The project website officially launched in early May with three main initiatives aimed at collecting individual stories and perspectives. The first initiative, “The Window Effect,” called on community members to submit images of the view from their windows and share experiences with self-isolation and social distancing. Submissions have been sent in from Dubai, Malaysia and numerous other countries around the world.
The Great Pause Project has also partnered with the Arch Mission Foundation, a nonprofit organization that is gathering the largest archive of human knowledge for long-term preservation, to archive their own library of submissions into a small time capsule. The time capsule will be sent on a lunar module by 2022, to not only allow the current contributors to reflect on their past but also to allow future generations the chance to look at a personal account of history. 
“Using [the time capsule] as an opportunity to uplift and inspire future generations is really why we thought it was important to send this message into space,” Gribble said.
The second initiative, “The Echo/Location Survey,” has been updated throughout recent months to reflect the constantly changing global stage. As the pandemic continued, the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led more people around the world to join in Black Lives Matter protests that generated widespread media attention. 
“The survey was an opportunity for folks to really record through written reflection the various elements of how they might be feeling, seeing the world and also thinking forward toward the future,” Beavers said.
One positive aspect to “The Echo/Location Survey” is its anonymity, which allows respondents to submit their personal experiences in a comfortable space. Soterakis said that a young woman in one submission explained how she was confronted with her parents’ abusive relationship when she came home from boarding school.
“The participant really wants to share their story with others who might be experiencing the same thing,” Beavers said. 
The survey seemed to be a cathartic and enjoyable exercise for respondents, who wrote more for each submission than the project creators expected, Soterakis said. The experience proved to be very intimate and personal.
Gribble and her co-collaborators had planned on making the project adaptable from the beginning. Being an open-source idea, the project had to be structured in a way that allowed individual contributors to influence and shift the focus of the project, especially since the creators could not anticipate exactly how the world would change in the near future.
The final and most recent initiative was the “COVID-19 Photo Diary,” which asked people to document their neighborhoods and environments throughout the pandemic. Submissions have included photos of discarded medical waste, such as gloves and masks, creative social distancing signs that use birds to measure out six feet and images of Black Lives Matter protests. 
“We could have never predicted that from this health crisis, it would evolve into a social ethics crisis which would evolve into a political campaign,” Gribble said.
In order to generate a wide breadth of submissions and involvement, Gribble and her team sent word of their project through an official Instagram page, personal social media accounts and newsletters sent to both their artistic and scientific communities. While the initial contacts were centralized in the L.A., New York and Boston areas, the team acknowledged the importance of capturing diverse perspectives in the project. 
Word of mouth contributed to the project’s global spread, which was especially evident in their work examining how university and boarding school students’ lives changed after returning home from the United States. One student in Dubai shared the project with their peers, which led to a surge in global submissions.
One goal of this crowd-sourced project, Gribble said, is to allow individuals to shape the continuing narrative, which is why the project remains open for submissions. By expanding the project’s reach and timeframe, Gribble and her team hope to continue to garner international contributions and generate a diverse set of voices.
According to Gribble, the pandemic proved to be a rare time to simultaneously reflect on the current moment and consider the future of our society and our role in shaping that future.
“The light at the end of the tunnel of [this project] is that we want to encourage people to envision a better future and also use this pandemic as inputs and a warning for future generations so they can maybe bypass some of the things that we’ve done,” Gribble said.
Artists hold a complex role in society as they showcase individual perspectives and communicate global concepts. For Beavers, this role developed a new responsibility to visualize the connected nature of society during a period of isolation.
Artists can also establish safe spaces for the general public to communicate their narratives and highlight perspectives that may counter dominant narratives in media. The project has encouraged Beavers to focus on a bigger picture during the pandemic: documenting individual narratives during a period of isolation and major social movements.
Students who are increasingly required to engage in virtual instruction are especially part of this continuing narrative, and their stories of coping with this reality are something Gribble and her team want to incorporate in their project.
“Recent [high school] graduates that are entering their freshman year, we would love to hear about their experience because they are the first ever generation to have to undergo something like this,” Soterakis said. “There is so much that you benefit from being on the college campus and the network and socializing.”

“The Fab Five,” one of the early ESPN 30 for 30 films by “The Last Dance” director Jason Hehir, profiles the University of Michigan men’s basketball team’s 1991 class of Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson. The film describes how the team became the first to predominantly start all freshmen, made two straight NCAA championship games and changed the culture of college basketball with their play and style. It also details how its legacy has been hidden away following sanctions for players receiving illegal gifts. This discussion contains spoilers, and we suggest you watch the film before reading.
Lauren Mattice: Knowing next to nothing about NCAA basketball history (at least I’m being honest), this 30 for 30 maybe surprised me the most out of any because of its emotional grounding of the team, the history it made and the legacy it created together for the rest of the basketball world to emulate.
Aidan Berg: Agreed! The biggest challenge facing a documentary crew or anyone else trying to make entertainment out of something is getting people to care about what they’re profiling. In this case, someone might ask why we should care about a team that never won a championship, and one of the big reasons is that it establishes who the Fab Five were as people. We get to see where they came from and how important it was to them to stick by that, how fun they were to be around and the bonds that they formed with each other. 
LM: Definitely, and there’s that fine line that many sports profiles struggle with, and that’s putting too much emphasis on either the hardships that athletes come from or on the “escape” that people assume these players are all too ready for. Here, Jalen Rose reminisces about playing with Webber while they were growing up, with his voice being the background to old game footage and team photos from Detroit, and scenes like this stay with you more than scenes of the scandals later to come. But in between the press spotlights, each one of them talks about how the support of their community and each other was what really made the experience worth it.
AB: I particularly loved the part where Ray Jackson, a Texas native, talks about being ready to go back to bed when he saw snow coming down and that Rose got him up and gave him his winter coat. Like you said, that’s the kind of thing that pays off later with the long shot of Chris Webber walking from the court to the locker room after the Timeout Game. It’s the ultimate example of show don’t tell because your heart breaks for the guy watching him with his head down, and that only works if you provide that emotional connection.
LM: That shot is the best because it cuts out the commentary, the background music and all of those additions that sometimes stray away from the point. And it is, literally, long, and you’re with Webber for the moment when the real emotional punch hits. But you’ve been through so much already with this group that when you see Webber going out as a first-overall draft pick a few weeks later, the doc has confirmed something that you might’ve forgotten in that moment after the championship game, and that was that these guys were always destined for greatness no matter when it came or in what form.
AB: You really feel the historical significance of that botched timeout when you see him trying to process it during that long shot, but I think that’s something the documentary does a really great job of throughout and is another crucial part to making the viewer care about this story. Not only does it tell you that what these guys were doing was unprecedented (buzzword of quarantine), but it shows you all the ways that they contributed to the basketball society we know today. 
LM: The little bit about them not wanting to wear those “speedos” of shorts that were popular at the time but wanting to follow Michael Jordan’s long and loose shorts style is one of the most hysterical. But when the Fab Five suited up in their baggy shorts and their plain black socks and brought a bit of home to the court by getting into competitors’ heads with some trash talk, everyone watched and then everyone followed. This was the guys at their most genuine and spirited selves, a picture that many either tried to profit off of, or opposed with such vehemence that a whole sequence was dedicated to the racist comments from their school’s own alumni that were mailed in on frequent occasion. 
AB: And it’s so effective in the film because it shows you concrete examples of them challenging the system and how things changed because of them. We see the progression from the hip-huggers to the style we see players wearing now, we see the Fab Five wearing plain blue T-shirts as a form of protest, and we can track that to where we are now with college athletes on the cusp of being compensated for their role in bringing money to a university. And, of course, we see the letters from those racist alumni and are faced with the horrible language they were using and we can see just how much pushback there was to the Fab Five bringing their authentic selves to college basketball. I think Hehir’s use of corporeal examples is why the points of this film are so strong. 
LM: The film and Hehir couldn’t do that without the guys’ one-on-one testimonies. You look them right in the eye, close-up and all, and hear about their joy and elation after committing to Michigan, and hear about the group forming but also the odds stacked against them. In the lead-up to their first championship title game as freshmen, you see the favorite Duke warming up with their pretty-boy star Christian Laettner, a white, New-York born and private-school trained college basketball super villain who Rose describes as the ideal recruit for Duke. They weren’t looking to bother themselves with an insanely talented but poor Black kid from Detroit, instead they went with what Jimmy King called, “a bitch.”
AB: Always love hearing people hate on Christian Laettner. But that’s another crucial part of this documentary, and it’s something the film itself points out: The Fab Five were great hangs! They were brash, funny and awesome to be around, and that helps the doc avoid the common issue that you brought up about how interviews can muddle the story. These guys add to it. Unfortunately, this strength is somewhat undercut by the notable absence of Chris Webber. We’re not going to get into the he said/he said beef that has existed between Webber and Rose since this film came out, but it is important to note that not having Webber there weakens the overall product.
LM: It simply isn’t complete. It’s understandable to not want to comment, to not want to get re-involved (certainly after the Michigan president and athletic director’s comments), but when you see shots of the guys celebrating after a dunk, pretending to be a rap group in Venice or just defending their prowess and talent as freshmen in press interviews, when you don’t have his perspective, there’s something to be lost and themes that cannot come full-force.
AB: And it’s especially striking at the end when everyone interviewed is talking about what they thought was going through Webber’s mind during that timeout play and telling him what he should do about his relationship with the university. It’s just so interesting to me that this documentary can be effective when probably its biggest character is completely missing.
LM: It definitely can be and is effective, but for me it’s in moments. I can appreciate what that long-shot showed and what it represents, but I can also be ambivalent about what it changed, and maybe that’s the point: to imitate real life. But in the end, the doc to me doesn’t really know what to do with itself after digging into this Webber-less hole. You can reflect on his stats, the Five’s memory of him and his impact on basketball, but you can’t truly understand the Fab Five without his voice.
AB: I hate that we agreed so much in this first edition (this is not what we advertised) so I’m going to push back a little bit as we finish up here. I don’t think that Webber’s absence was a back-breaking blow to what I consider to be the true point of the film, which is the impact this group had on basketball culture. That still shines through even without him, and that’s why I basically grew up never questioning the idea that the amateur system of college sports is inherently flawed and exploitative, that players should be allowed to stay true to who they are and where they come from and that talent wins out over everything. Watching this film at around age 12 was one of the first times those concepts were introduced to me, and in that way I think “The Fab Five” is undoubtedly a success.
LM: Can’t argue with childhood wonder. I will say one of the best returns to this film will be seeing Juwan Howard’s coaching career at Michigan. So much has changed for collegiate basketball but also for players’ rights under the NCAA. Real discussions are coming up to counter the experience they had of seeing their own jersey being sold for $75 in a storefront while they were struggling to pay for gas. We haven’t seen what form the new name, image and likeness standards will take, and we still haven’t seen enough consideration by the NCAA or universities for collegiate athletes as human beings, so I think this legacy Howard comes back to that the Fab Five created will continue to push the conversations in the right direction.

In recent seasons, USC’s women’s soccer team has been one of the Trojans’ most successful programs, due in large part to head coach Keidane McAlpine and his staff. 
But when McAlpine took over the program after the 2013 season, the Trojans had not posted a winning record in the previous three seasons.
“We looked at the group and we were like, ‘Man, this is one of the most talented rosters in the league,’” McAlpine said. “The question is, what’s the disconnect?” 
Whatever that disconnect was, McAlpine found it and elevated USC to not only a winning record but a national championship in just three seasons. In his last four years at the helm, McAlpine’s Trojans have a record of 68 wins, 14 losses and eight draws, posting a staggering .756 winning percentage. They are now considered a national powerhouse.
Last season, the Trojans reached a ranking as high as No. 2 in the NCAA, tying their highest ranking in program history. 
McAlpine’s ability to turn a program around is not unique to USC. Previous coaching stints at Birmingham-Southern and Washington State have helped McAlpine find success in Los Angeles. 
When transitioning to a new school, McAlpine says he hopes to galvanize the team before tweaking anything on the field. 
“One of the things that I try to do is instill a belief, a direction … those two things together,” McAlpine said. “That’s the first step, and then in doing so, trying to create discipline, attitude, technique and skill.” 
McAlpine said he never says anything negative to his players — and that that’s highly intentional. 
“I always felt like if you told them exactly the ‘why’ behind what you want, they’re going to work hard to give it back to you,” McAlpine said. “Correct the little things, but try to catch them doing it right and celebrate those things as loud and as much as you can because everybody loves a compliment.”
While McAlpine brings a positive approach to his coaching style, he also brings a perspective no other women’s soccer coach in the Pac-12 can: that of a Black man in the United States. McAlpine said being Black in the U.S. helps him understand the importance of the discipline and hard work necessary for success.
McAlpine said he does not feel any extra pressure being a Black women’s soccer coach at USC but that he does feel a responsibility to those that he hopes follow him. 
“I do feel the weight of being the only Black coach in the Pac-12 — not necessarily for myself, but if I have success, it allows people to view the next person of color that may interview or reach out for a job an opportunity to maybe get a look that they might not have gotten before,” McAlpine said.
With the coronavirus pandemic keeping the team’s meetings over Zoom, McAlpine said he has been able to have conversations with the team about the ongoing battle for social justice in the U.S. and globally. 
“During that stretch of two weeks, the world got to watch two men die on film, right?” McAlpine said, referring to the police killings of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks on May 25 and June 12, respectively. “And let’s take the race out of it — how does that make you feel as a human?”
McAlpine has seen his own players recently take action at USC. In response to police brutality against Black Americans in recent months, sophomore midfielder Olufolasade Adamolekun co-founded the United Black Student-Athletes Association, earning high praise from McAlpine.
“I’m super proud of her, especially as young as she is,” he said. “It’s not like she’s been on campus a long time.”
For McAlpine, being a successful coach and mentor starts with his faith, a foundation for bringing out the best in the women he coaches — on and off the field. 
“We’re going to go through some things as human beings and every player is going to have some things they have to go through,” McAlpine said. “And if I can stay compassionate and come at it from a place of love, empathy and compassion, then I think we as a group will be grounded in the right things.”
McAlpine said he did not truly understand the impact he had as a coach until winning the national championship in 2016. 
“I had some coaches who were at the semifinal and final games who basically came up to me [and] said ‘The only reason I’m here is because you’re here,’” McAlpine said. “That was a pretty eye-opening experience.”
Through his compassion for his players, McAlpine has fostered an environment where young women are able to find success on and off the field — all under a coach who celebrates their every win as loud as he can. Not only is Keidane McAlpine a break from the norm; he’s an example of another way to find immense success at a high level. 
“If you think more about how this is going to affect the whole rather than the I, more people are gonna want to be around you,” McAlpine said. “If you have discipline, do the right things and leave things better than you found it, all of those things play into creating an environment where people learn more, they enjoy themselves more … If all those things are true, it sort of funnels itself into success.”
