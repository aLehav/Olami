The USC women’s basketball team fell 69-68 in the final seconds to Arizona State on the road Sunday as Temi Fagenble’s basket as at the buzzer was called off after the officials ruled time expired before she took the shot. 
Arizona State’s Sophie Brunner hit a game-winning layup plus the foul with one second remaining to give the Sun Devils (20-4, 11-1) the narrow victory. 
Brunner finished with nine points and six rebounds and teammate Arnecia Hawkins finished with 12 points as the Sun Devils defeated the Women of Troy (17-7, 5-7) in a nail-biter.  
Arizona State tied the game 66-66 on a layup by Kelsey Moos with 13 seconds remaining. Temi Fagbenle responded with a jumper with four seconds remaining to retake the lead and then hit a tough jumper with second seconds remaining to give USC a 68-66 lead. It seemed like the game was over until Brunner made an and-one layup to retake the lead for the Sun Devils. 
Arizona State came into today as one of the best defenses in the country, limiting opponents to a meager 52.9 points per game.  However, the Sun Devils struggled defensively to start the game as USC jumped out to a 22-10 lead in the first quarter. Sadie Edwards had her way in the first quarter, scoring eight points as the Sun Devils struggled to stay in front of her.  
Arizona State started off the second quarter with a 10-4 run, hitting a pair of 3-pointers while cutting the USC lead to 26-23 before Coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke called a timeout. USC came out of the timeout with a layup by Khaedin Taito but the Trojans struggled on the defensive end as Arizona State continued to score at will. 
It seemed like the Women of Troy would be able to head into the half with a 34-32 lead but Aliyah Mazyck was called for a foul as USC tried to inbound the ball with 25 seconds remaining. Peace Amukamara proceeded to hit two free throws to tie the game at 34-34 heading into the half.  
USC started the second half on a 7-3 run to take a 41-37 lead but Arizona State was able to tie the game again on a jumper by Amukamara. Neither team took control of the game and the two teams traded baskets until Mazyck eventually hit two free throws to tie the game at 52-52 with seven seconds remaining in the third quarter.
USC went on a 6-0 run following a layup by Arizona State’s Elisha Davis to take a 58-54 lead. It seemed like the Women of Troy would finally pull away after Edwards hit a jumper to take a 64-58 lead with 5 minutes remaining in the game. But the Sun Devils came back with baskets by Quinn Dornstauder and Katie Hempen to cut the lead to 64-62. 
Edwards led the way for the Women of Troy, finishing with a game-high 26 points. Courtney Jaco, coming off a career-high 24-point performance against the University of Arizona on Friday, had a quiet game on Sunday, finishing with five points.  Fagbenle struggled to stay on the floor after committing two fouls in the first three minutes of the game but managed to finish with 10 points and eight rebounds.
After losing to lowly Colorado last Sunday, USC followed up with a win against the Wildcats on Friday. But with today’s loss, USC falls to 5-7 in conference play.  
The Women of Troy return home next week to play Washington and Washington State. USC lost to both teams on the road in Washington in their previous matchup. The Women of Troy will have their hands full on Friday night when the nation’s leading scorer, Kelsey Plum of Washington, comes to town. Plum had 32 points in the Huskies’ 69-60 victory over USC on January 17.  The Trojans will then play Washington State and freshman star, Borislava Hristova, who had 21 points against USC in their previous matchup.

Daily Trojan: What is the key issue you’re hoping to tackle?
USG Vice Presidential Candidate Austin Dunn: I don’t think there’s one overlying issue we’re trying to tackle. The bottom line is we’re very passionate about advocating on behalf of students and meeting the student need, and we see where that need is, and we know that we’re equipped enough and have the experience to make that need turn it to reality. Whether that’s incorporating free laundry on campus or extending dining hall hours during major breaks for students who either can’t afford to go home or choose not to go home, there’s literally a plethora of different platform points across the board, and I think that just arose from us listening to students and thereby going to create action for what the need is.
DT: Are you planning on continuing advocacy for college affordability and if so how?
USG Presidential Candidate Edwin Saucedo: What we want to do is first be able to understand where administration is coming from, and what they can and can’t do. For example, one thing we talked about in our meeting last week is that they’re not going to give us salaries for specific positions so just understanding what’s feasible and making sure we have a seat at the table and are bringing up these issues.
DT: What do you think the role of diversity is on campus, in campus conversations as we move into this next presidency?
ES: We want to not only increase space for cultural resource centers but we also want to have in-house counselors that look like people like us, to make sure that when you’re talking to a counselor you feel comfortable sharing your experience and sharing your background because it could be very intimidating to go into the counseling center over at Engemann right now if someone doesn’t look like you to have to validate your experience to them and tell them, “This is how I feel as a brown person on campus” … and them maybe thinking, “Yeah I have to validate them, but I don’t really relate to them.”
DT: What do you see as the role of greek life on USC’s campus?
AD: Some of the greatest student leaders I know, some of the most passionate people on campus, happen to be greek, so I think there’s more than just all of the issues that we’re hearing about but there definitely is more integration that needs to be happen. If we’re saying that we’re having a greek meeting, that’s not just going to mean PHC and IFC that’s a simple change that we’re going to start with, but I think the definition of the word greek on this campus needs to change.
DT: Can you elaborate on your plans for sexual assault prevention?
ES: We want to decrease the [response] time by having more staff available to our students, and I think that now that the racial bias reporting form is live, that also goes to the Title IX office, so yes, our University is making avenues for students to be able to report all these different issues, but how long is it going to take for you to get answers on something that happened to you? The other thing that we wanted to do is prevention and response programs.
DT: How do you plan to continue to mental health advocacy on campus?
ES: Recently USC released a video that said there’s 3,000 first-generation college students. As a first-generation college student, you often don’t want to ask for help or you’re afraid to ask for help. The best way to ask for help is to be able to go to someone that you feel comfortable with. That could be a great way to start with the cultural resource centers, because a lot of these students are already going to those centers and can take advantage of those services without feeling like, “Oh, I have to go all the way to Engemann to get mental health [services].”
DT: Would you make any modifications to Sustainability 2020?
ES: We want to contribute to the Green Engagement Fund … we want to make sure that not only contributing to them but working alongside with them to make sure that some of the projects that they’re doing, maybe we can take them on and get those implemented through administration so that USC can pay for them.
DT: Can you tell us about your plans to address the spring admit, transfer and commuter student communities?
ES: One of the things we want to do with spring admits specifically is work with the [Peer Leadership Consultants] to make sure that they’re being paired with someone who understands some of the campus clubs that are around and already available and is able to recommend, based on your interests, what kind of clubs you could go be going to. With the commuter student lounge, now that there’s new space opening up at the University Village that’s prime opportunity to be able to offer space for students to not only have a lounge but also have lockers because a lot of students carry heavy books and can’t be carrying them from class to class when they’re here all day, most commuter students block their schedules so that they only have to come to campus a couple of days a week so we want to make sure that during those days that  they’re coming to campus they have access to lockers to put their stuff in between classes.

Daily Trojan: Can you talk about your platform and a key issue you’d like to tackle?
USG Presidential Candidate Charlie Henriquez: We really want to implement a fall break and get somewhere where we can reach a consensus about fall break. And the faculty groups have actually rejected the proposal to have a fall break because they won’t be able to submit some winter grades on time.
USG Vice Presidential Candidate Cole Pham: We really want to help enhance [the first-year experience] and make sure that everyone coming to campus really feels that love and that Trojan home. A couple things about sustainability on the platform — we use a lot of water, whenever we use the sprinklers and there’s a lot of water running from the grass and onto the pavement. Obviously, the pavement doesn’t need the water. We want to reduce, or if anything, better aim the sprinklers so that it’s better hitting the grass. Also, more solar paneling on roofs that otherwise wouldn’t have anything on the roofs.
DT: This year, there has been a surge in student engagement and activism. How do you plan on continuing this momentum?
CP: This past year in RSG, the amount of programs that I, as a Vice President of Programming Board, had to put on increased. So, what I had to do was put on more Cardinal and Gold events, which are events on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.
DT: What are your thoughts on the Rini Sampath-Jordan Fowler administration?
CH: I’m glad they brought up the Campus Climate Initiative … That ties into our platform as well, where we want to create something practical and go forward with step-by-step. The first thing we want to do is create a mobile app where we can consolidate all kinds of resources … all in a phone on all different platforms, so students can check where they identify and not make that trek that they don’t want to make.
DT: People also identify with their greek organizations on campus. Can you comment on greek life’s role at USC?
CH: Just like any organization, I feel like it’s a good home here. Any organization can be that home; greek life is just a certain home for the people that choose it. This is also another reason why we chose to stand against deferment to the spring semester because it would be biased to defer just greek rush process and not the deferment of any other student organization.
DT:  Other underrepresented groups on campus include spring admit, transfer and commuter students. How do you plan on promoting cohesion within those populations.
CH: There’s been a very big talk about having commuter lounges and spring admit lounges, so that’s something we really want to push. That’s something that’s pretty prevalent within USG and create initiatives for that. Similar problems when we’re trying to expand the cultural center space, the same for when we’re trying to get these lounges for different constituencies.
DT: Another thing the Rini-Jordan administration strived for was college affordability, How do you plan on promoting that?
CH: As long as the administration is getting the point across, that’s a good starting point, but we really want to continue on that and we really want to get to a point where we can sit down with the administration and write something where we can finally see this is a budget transparency, this is budget allocation, where we know that our money is being spent correctly, where we finally can get to a point where we can create a tuition freeze. 
DT: What are your plans to enhance transparency within USG?
CP: Getting things through funding boards are usually things that are tedious and take a long time and we don’t really know what happens. So, really exposing what funding boards and seeing not only a general guideline of how you apply and what is your general criterion to receive this funding. When we can create a better system where students know how to get this funding, when people don’t feel confused about how to get this funding.
DT: One big issue we have on campus is sexual assault prevention. How do you plan on advocating?
CH: We really think that if we have an examiner at Engemann Student Health Center, it will help people overall and make people not feel like they live in the shadows due to an assault of any kind, whether that be a sexual assault, domestic violence, we really want to make sure that we’re giving those students who have the victim of this the opportunities to feel like they belong here.

A full house awaited the performance of Vampire Weekend’s bassist Chris Baio at the El Rey Theatre on Thursday evening as he kicked off his North American tour with a debut of his recent album, The Names. Released last fall, the album features an array of eclectic electro-pop tracks much different from what Vampire Weekend fans are used to hearing.Baio’s tour marks the use of integrated visual graphics to supplement his tracks, a feature that led audience members to roar with excitement.
The show included opening performances from DJ Marion Hodges, Michl and Elohim. Michl was the first to walk onstage to perform three unreleased tracks and one popular track titled “Kill Our Way to Heaven,” released only three months ago on SoundCloud with over already 1.2 million hits. Fans described this track as smooth, powerful, reserved and hauntingly beautiful, a clearly shared sentiment among audience members. Elohim, too, performed four tracks including, “Pigments,” “Xanax,” “She Talks Too Much” and “Bridge and the Wall,” without ever showing her face on the stage. Known for keeping her identity hidden so that fans can listen to her music without any distractions, Elohim brought a great deal of energy to the crowd — a perfect transition into Baio’s set.
Baio, a native to New York, moved to London in the summer of 2013, a dramatic transition that granted him the inspiration for his new album.  Still very much an active member of Vampire Weekend, Baio has been able to pursue his own passion for deejaying by creating independent electronic tracks that feature a sense of an ongoing restlessness. The album flows continuously. Thursday’s show featured some of The Names’ hottest hits such as “Sister of Pearl,” “Endless Rhythm” and “Brainwash Yyrr Face.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Baio discussed the driving forces toward his music and what he looks forward to on tour.
Daily Trojan: What do you expect from the North American tour and what are you most looking forward to?
Chris Baio: For me, touring and playing live is like the reward after making a record. So far, there has kind of been a lot of starts and stops … right now, it’s the start of about six to seven weeks of solid touring. This record is something I’ve been thinking about for a really long time — even going back to 2009. I finished it by the end of 2014, and in a way it was my little secret — this thing I had to exorcise from my head, and now getting to play every night to a crowd makes it real to me.
DT: What was your inspiration for The Names?
CB: I moved from New York, where I had lived my whole life, to London in the summer of 2013, and I guess I found that it was really inspiring for me when it came to writing lyrics and sort of thinking of identity. I had a new kind of perspective to look back on my life up to that point, and a new life to be excited by. That’s where a lot of the lyrics came from. There’s a song called “Endless Rhythm,” and a lot of that is about living in London and what it’s like to live in the city and even something as simple as the relationship between people and the ground and sky.
DT: How is The Names different from your other albums such as Sunburn?
CB: What was new with this record was using my voice and trying to sing and write lyrics and vocal hooks. I found that I really enjoyed it, but it was definitely the most challenging part of the record.
DT: Is it difficult to transition yourself from being the bassist for Vampire Weekend to working as an independent producer? What are some of the challenges you face shifting gears from bassist to producer?
CB: I think the dynamic of deejaying versus playing in a band, is all about the social contract of the performer. When you play in a band, there’s a social contract that people will buy tickets and come see you play and you’ll play songs that they know in some fashion, but when you DJ, it’s not as clear. And, I think as a result there is the opportunity for people going to see you DJ to be really disappointed and angry at you. It’s something that I think helped me develop a thicker skin as an artist.
DT: What advice do you have for young aspiring producers graduating from college trying to make it big in the music industry?
CB: Listen to a song that you don’t like and be able to identify an element or a sound that you do like, be able to separate the different sounds from the songs, and if you can isolate something that you like from something that you don’t like, I think that goes a long way to knowing what you wanna be and who you want to be as a producer.

The world of music lost funk legend Maurice White died Thursday morning at the age of 74 in his Los Angeles home. White, founder and leader of popular R&B group Earth, Wind & Fire, suffered from Parkinson’s disease. White is remembered for his 53-year career in the music industry.
White was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, in the winter of 1941 where he was childhood friends with Booker T. Jones. In his teenage years, White traveled to Chicago where he worked as a session drummer for Chess Records. He started a songwriting tream with his friends, Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead. White moved to Los Angeles where he added members to the group, including his younger brother, Verdine White, and renamed the group, Earth, Wind & Fire.
White helped the band release their debut album, also named Earth, Wind & Fire, in February 1971 that received critical acclaim. They went on to sell more than ninety million album copies over the course of their career, with hits co-written by White, such as “That’s the Way of the World,” “September” and “In the Stone”. The band gained rapid fame and were soon performing all over the world.
White was known for his tenor voice, producing beautiful contrast to Philip Bailey’s falsetto and for leading energetic, dynamic live performances.
The band is known for being a paradigm of funk in the ‘70s and ‘80s. With White as the bandleader, the group spearheaded new ideas and experimented with new sounds that would otherwise not exist. White is praised for his contributions to funk and soul music, which made the genres what they are today. EWF served as one of America’s top performing groups for many decades, with White leading the group to international stardom.
Maurice White alongside Earth, Wind & Fire was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. White was personally nominated for 21 Grammy awards, of which he won seven. Additionally, he received a plethora of awards such as the ASCAP Pop Music Award, four American Music awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Verdine White said of his brother’s death, “My brother, hero and best friend Maurice White passed away peacefully last night in his sleep. While the world has lost another great musician and legend, our family asks that our privacy is respected as we start what will be a very difficult and life changing transition in our lives. Thank you for your prayers and well wishes.”
White and EWF will be honored at the Grammy awards on Feb. 15.

Community members gathered on Jefferson Boulevard in between Vermont Avenue and Normandie Avenue Saturday morning for Make Jefferson Beautiful, an event jointly sponsored by the Redeemer Community Partnership and Koreatown Youth and Community Center.
In operation for several years now, Redeemer Community Partnership and KYCC put on two tree-planting events per month to service the northern and southern Los Angeles areas with the goal of promoting sustainability. Saturday’s planting event was part of efforts to make Jefferson Boulevard more attractive to pedestrians, bike riders and businesses. While the event was open to all members of Los Angeles, most of the volunteers came from the immediate area, wanting to participate in the beautification of their own neighborhood.
“I used to live around the corner,” volunteer Marvin Aragon said. “That’s how I got involved. I have two boys, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old, and bringing them here is an encouragement to give back to the community. On a big street like this there aren’t many trees. People walk from school and walk from work or the bus stop. Now they’ll have shade. That was the biggest encouragement for me to come out here in the early morning.”
Most volunteers chose to sign up for the satisfaction and gratitude they got from the surrounding community once the job is done.
“Whenever there are events in the community I am down to support that,” volunteer Tony Casado said. “The comments, even as we’re working, of the community members walking by saying that we’re doing good work makes you feel really good.”
Following a quick explanation of proper tree planting and a demonstration using the correct tools and techniques, the volunteers split up into four smaller groups, each group given the responsibility of planting three or four trees during the three-hour volunteer period. The planting spanned both sides and two blocks of Jefferson Boulevard. With a grand total of about 16 trees planted on Saturday morning, the event exactly doubled the original number of trees.
Planting is merely the first step in the long beautification process taking place on Jefferson Boulevard. Community members involved in the tree-planting days are encouraged to return for scheduled maintenance of the planted trees.
“Most of the time, when we plant the trees with the community, we do upkeep with those exact members of the community,” Jerry Velasquez, KYCC tree planting crew chief, said. “We let them know that in two months we are going to have a maintenance day to service the trees, prune anything that needs to be pruned and fix the stakes. If the trees aren’t growing straight, we are there to figure out why that is.”
Initiatives to further beautify and maintain Jefferson will continue throughout 2016 through more community volunteer events and immersion programs with the population of the greater Los Angeles area.
“We are actually trying to partner with USC through the USC Good Neighbors Program,” Niki Wong, the coordinator for Saturday’s event, said. “This would allow us to beautify Jefferson Boulevard even more. Before today’s planting there are 16 or 17 trees on this street, but through this partnership, we would be able to plant even more than we already are today.”
Furthermore, Redeemer Community Partnership will be sponsoring an informational session and public conversation concerning their partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Public Transportation.
“There are actually bike lanes already drawn onto the street,” Wong said. “They haven’t been paved yet, so we are having this meeting on March 5 to beautify Jefferson Boulevard even more by adding those bike lanes, curb extensions and corridor to make it a safer place to be and work.”

First-generation students, faculty, staff and alumni gathered together at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Saturday at the inaugural summit for first-generation college students hosted by USC’s First-Generation College Student Task Force.
The event, titled “First-Generation College Student Summit: Paths to Success,” had participants and speakers discuss how being a first-generation, or “first-gen,” college student impacted their identity.
The idea to create a summit for first-generation college students stemmed from a three-year series of discussions among the First-Generation College Student Task Force, comprised of USC faculty and students.
George Sanchez, the vice dean for diversity and strategy initiatives from the Dornsife Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives, delivered the opening remarks.
“We thought it was important to gather faculty, staff and students together to employ the best practices on meeting the needs of first gens and share this information with all first-gen college students,” Sanchez said.
This committee, headed by Sanchez and Mary Ho, the assistant dean for diversity and strategic initiatives from the Dornsife Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives, organized the summit.
As a first-generation college student himself, Sanchez identified with his audience.
“I’m first-gen because I am a role model for other members of my family, my community and the students I now teach,” Sanchez said. “I’m first-gen because I have and will continue to overcome obstacles put in front of me. I am first-gen because I see a part of me in each of you.”
Sanchez also introduced the launch of a new website geared toward first-generation students.
“The website is intended to provide resources and information designed specifically for first-generation college students in order to help them navigate the university structure,” Sanchez said.
After Sanchez’s remarks, the summit held a four-person panel featuring alumni Ana Elizabeth Rosas ’06 and Nick Valencia ’05. The panelists relayed their narratives as first-generation college students and offered advice.
Valencia, currently a CNN correspondent, described the challenges and responsibilities he faces as a Latino journalist.
“I went from being the white-washed kid in Northeast L.A. to the ambassador of my culture in Atlanta,” Valencia said. “I have dealt with all sorts of those challenges; even at a company like CNN, I still experienced ethnic and diversity challenges. I feel like it’s important for me to shed misconceptions and help people understand.”
After the panel, participants moved to the first breakout session which provided smaller groups for more in-depth discussion.
Breyona White, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, attended the summit as a way to meet and have a discourse with students that were from similar backgrounds.
“To connect with other first-generation students, since it’s not really a question asked commonly, and convene around the same problems and struggles we all face,” White said.
After the opening remarks and panel, White attended the “Taking Advantage of High-Impact Practices” breakout session with Sanchez and three recent alumni.
“I thought it was a really great breakout session,” White said. “We talked about practices you can use throughout your undergraduate career to be successful, and if you stay consistent, there’s a really high chance you’ll be.”
After lunch, she went to two other breakout sessions, “Increase Motivation, Decrease Anxiety and Get Things Done” and “Student Success from Undergrad to Grad.”
During lunch, the planning committee announced award recipients. Sam Fisher ’11 won the Community Leadership Award for his Sam Fisher Fellows program which grants first-generation students scholarships, Lanita Jacobs, an associate professor in anthropology and American studies and ethnicity in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, earned the Faculty Mentor Award and current Undergraduate Student Government Senator Sabrina Enriquez ’18 was awarded the Student Leadership Award.
Provost Michael Quick then addressed the crowd as the keynote speaker. He discussed his journey as a first-generation college student and gave the attendees advice.
The day ended with a resource fair, closing and reception in the TCC Ballroom.
Katie Bolton, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies and NGOs and social change, served as a volunteer and helped plan the event.
A first-generation student herself, she wanted to be able to give back.
“Up until this point, there hasn’t been a place for first-gen students to come together and learn what we’re learning about,” Bolton said. “College can be very intimidating when you get here. It was important to help make the summit possible because students need the help.”

A visit to the doctor often means long waits or stuffy sitting rooms scattered with outdated magazines. In a joint project between Keck School of Medicine of USC, USC’s Center for Body Computing and USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, a team of doctors, researchers and creative directors are working on a new model of healthcare delivery that will redefine how patients receive care.
The Virtual Care Clinic is a service-based digital platform that incorporates diverse functions in healthcare delivery, from connecting patients to healthcare professionals to collecting data that can be used to inform future treatments. The VCC is special because it can be accessed anywhere from a user’s mobile device, allowing patients to easily receive attention from their doctors without physically entering a clinic or hospital.
Cardiologist Leslie Saxon, executive director for the Center for Body Computing and professor of clinical medicine at Keck Medical School, said that this project is groundbreaking.
“I think we’re definitely one of the first digital health entities other than [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], which has quite a different area of focus in digital health,” Saxon said. “I think what’s really unique about ours is this ICT partnership and the creative, virtual human aspect which is very unique to us.“
The ICT is a research center specializing in emergent forms of digital technology, including artificial intelligence, computer graphics and immersive techniques such as virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality.
Clarke Lethin, managing director of the ICT, said that government agencies are important for ICT.
“The research is funded by a number of government agencies looking at how do we take digital technologies and leverage those digital technologies for learning, education, training and behavior modification,” Lethin said.
Technology and research from the ICT is being applied to the VCC in an effort to creatively enhance user experience where other digital platforms may fall short. The VCC incorporates digital avatars of healthcare professionals that stand in for their human counterparts in basic check-ins and health instruction.
Prototypes for these digital avatars include a full computer-generated representation of Saxon, which is capable of presenting general instructions and asking simple questions. This technology allows the world of healthcare to go digital while preserving some of the warmth of the patient-doctor relationship.
“The institute has extensive research in not only creating these virtual humans,” Lethin said. “We also study the impact on the user and how well the user is relating to that virtual human as being something real, embodied, having emotions, delivering the content in such a way that’s meaningful.”
The research has uncovered that users become more likely to divulge information when they believe it is anonymous, making the platform potentially useful for treating post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety disorders.
“We have to create that killer healthcare product that really resonates with people,” Saxon said.
The team has high ambitions for the VCC, wanting it to be more than a service but a model for global health efforts that will impact the entire world.
The VCC has potential to solve complications in healthcare delivery. Physicians will spend less time answering mundane questions and collecting data for compliance and more time on the complicated care, which will increase quality. Simultaneously, the patients will receive increased contact and personalized care from their doctors.
“Between Leslie’s work and position at Keck Medical and the Center for Body Computing, all part of USC, ICT interfaces with Viterbi, with Annenberg, with Marshall, with Roski, [and has] a strong affiliation with the School of Cinema,” Lethin said. “It’s a multidisciplined approach to a very complex problem, and USC is sitting on that cusp of being able to leverage all of that talent and all of those schools to really solve a difficult problem.”
Depression is amongst the most common issues people experience today, but it is also very curable with medication, therapy along with other self-help options. 
 We read this book that is interesting. It has helped my friend in treating depression. You are able to find it on google by looking for treatment depression guides Jake Brown to get the method which I utilized.  
I would like to peer more posts like this .
Depression is one of the most common issues people experience today, but it’s also very treatable with medicine, treatment along with other self-help choices. 
There are lots of depression treatment solutions available, especially over the internet, I have found a review site that helps people get the best solutions online… It seams they put a lot of time and research, and have given our Impartial, Trustworthy Reviews. Google for Jake Brown treatment guides depression to obtain the site 
An excellent read. I’ll certainly be back.

On the unassuming outskirts of Glendale, nestled between the SR-134 and I-5 freeways a few blocks west of the Americana shopping center, the Moonlight Rollerway has kept its doors open to devout skaters since 1950. The venue often holds themed nights, whether it be based on an era or an artist in particular, but Thursday evening’s sold-out “Skate Night for David Bowie” made for a colorful and high-speed celebration of the artist’s multigenre career after his passing earlier this year.
Since his early career in the ‘60s, the multi-instrumentalist’s catalog has spanned musical styles like pop, art rock, electronic, R&B and funk. He even waded into the experimental realm, as demonstrated on his chart-topping final album Blackstar which was released mere days before he died, leaving fans simultaneously mourning and analyzing the album’s complex lyrical foreshadowing of his death.
Bowie’s immense influence over music listeners all over the world manifested itself in countless tribute events that have cropped up since his death on Jan. 10 — and continue into February with no end in sight. L.A. County has been home to vast amounts of these commemorative events, from movie screenings to cover band performances, and one such gathering that landed on alternative publication L.A. Weekly’s radar was the skate night in question. Shortly thereafter, self-styled goblin kings and suffragettes travelled in droves to snap up tickets in person, selling out the event in a few days.
Of course, the right music is essential to any roller rink. Skate Night for David Bowie was proposed, crafted and soundtracked by the Moonlight’s own resident DJ, Tavis Balkin. His involvement at the rink began with a flyer advertising an opening for someone who could DJ and skate, and in the short time it took to get his foot in the door, Balkin learned how to do both, from scratch. Throughout his time as a disc jockey, he’s fine-tuned his selections for the optimal skating experience.
“Most [DJs] tend to play Top 40, which I avoid. I play mostly seventies disco and funk, eighties new wave and synthpop, and some nineties music,” Balkin said. “It makes for a more propulsive soundtrack.”
One day after Bowie’s death, Balkin thought up his tribute, and texted his manager to inquire if anyone had yet claimed a Bowie night. When he got the green light, Balkin put together a Facebook event page, the guests of which ballooned to over 3,600 “attending” and 10,000 “interested” – no wonder spots went fast. Balkin credits the event’s popularity to Bowie’s own musical prowess.
“So many people came out since Bowie has a far-reaching influence that transcends pop music,” he said.
The evening saw guests of all ages and skating levels congregating under the neon-colored fluorescent lights – just one aspect of the Moonlight’s kitsch charm. Balkin’s exclusive medley of all-Bowie tracks included hits like “Rebel Rebel,” “Let’s Dance” and “Sound and Vision,” providing the tempo to which captivated skaters strode and sang along.
Besides roller skating, guests of the Moonlight had much to occupy themselves with throughout the night. A selection of arcade games attracted the attention — and coins — of many a young Bowie fan, just tall enough to barely peek over the machine’s edge. The bustling snack bar offers roller rink mainstays like pretzels, pizza and popcorn at prices that look like they haven’t changed much since the venue’s inception in the 50s, to hungry guests’ delight. The highlight of the skating soirée, however, was the costume contest inspired by the late musician’s multiple stage personas over the years. As many of the attendees came in dressed full Bowie regalia — portraying characters like the electrifying Aladdin Sane and the slicked-back Thin White Duke — it was quite the competition.
As the event was sold out, navigation became a slight issue — novice skaters saturated the rink, gliding every which way and taking others down with them.
Despite the minor setbacks, such as the lack of an online ordering system, Skate Night for David Bowie was a tremendous success, and achieved what it set out to do: draw in all the Bowie lovers of Southern California to revel in his unprecedented musical career in a historic building. Like many in attendance, the DJ paving the way felt the solidarity on a grand level.
“I’m glad to see people this excited to be skating and this excited about Bowie and his legacy,” Balkin said.

With the USG elections only one day away, Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath and Vice President Jordan Fowler reflect on their time in their respective roles and the legacy they hope to leave, marked by increasing campus inclusivity and college affordability.
Last February, Sampath and Fowler made history as the first all-female presidential ticket to be elected at USC.
“Whenever people ask me, like, what was the best moment? When you found out you won? And I always say no, it was actually the moment before … I looked around the room and it was just filled with people we love and people who care, people who will stand out on Trousdale during days when it was blistering hot; they were willing to stay up with us, anything, you name it,” Sampath said.
The nostalgic Sampath and Fowler recall the day they won their positions in USG.
“It just made me realize the power of unconditional love and friendship during those weeks,” recalled Sampath said about her former campaigning days.
As they reflect on the group effort required to win the election, the support and dedication provided by fellow classmates marked that day for them. Just as they sought to increase student involvement within their original campaign initiatives, they have continued to advocate on issues such as expanded student inclusion.
Sampath and Fowler have made use of the year, delivering on the promise initially made while campaigning: real results. While incorporating their plans to enhance equity, diversity and inclusion into each project, they have gauged student responses to guide their approach.
“Last semester was a really pivotal time in student activism and student advocacy given everything that was going on at college campuses across our nation,” Sampath said. “We played our part as the student government and the student community by hosting forums for students where they could speak out about their own experiences with bias and prejudices on our campus.”
These forums gave students a space to openly address topics needing explicit discussion, such as inclusion. Using the voices of students as a driving force, Sampath and Fowler have led an effort this past
year with
improved awareness for underrepresented students on campus.
Sampath and Fowler spearheaded the Campus Climate Resolution that the USG Senate presented in November asking for a $100 million fund to support underrepresented students and tenured faculty positions for underrepresented minorities. As Fowler indicates, understanding diversity requires a new approach to how students are educated.
“Diversity doesn’t necessarily need to be seen in the ways that we think … it’s so important that diversity, equity and inclusion are included in all parts of our advocacy efforts” Fowler said.
Their vision for the remainder of their term involves more communication with students. In November, USG presented the college affordability and transparency resolution, employing student feedback to account the needs of the everyday Trojan. The survey, which received 1,903 student responses, includes a number of lengthy responses from students depicting extreme financial challenges.
“It was really touching, and some of it was heartbreaking too, hearing from students that they are skipping meals and starting a GoFundMe to afford tuition here, especially given the increase that occurs every single year,” Sampath said.
As the USG campaign season begins, Fowler believes she and Sampath are leaving USG in capable hands.
Fowler said she was impressed by both USG presidential tickets’ dedication.
“I think when it comes down to it, I have really had the chance to work with Edwin [Saucedo] and Austin [Dunn],” Fowler said when asked which presidential ticket she supported. “Since my first days on this campus, Austin has been my delegate, so I have been a huge supporter of him since the very beginning. I really do believe in him, and I see them being greater leaders for this school.”
Although Sampath has not publicly endorsed any candidates, she did highlight that this is the first year USG has allowed for USC leaders to be able to publicly endorse a candidate.
With a 120-person cabinet, the Sampath-Fowler administration called for a tuition freeze — an action not implemented by the administration — lobbied to increase awareness for mental health and sexual assault prevention, supported new sustainability practices alongside Provost Michael Quick and funded student trips such as for the a cappella group the SoCal VoCals who sang at the White House to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama in January.
Despite their term coming to an end, Sampath and Fowler express optimism more than anything else. For them, work continues as usual.
On Feb. 24, they are introducing  a resolution calling for a fall break to the Faculty Senate, bringing in health professionals to aid their discussion.

Valentine’s Day weekend is no doubt a movie weekend — whether single or with someone, you’re bound to land somewhere (theater or couch) for a couple hours of escape. For studios and production companies, the Valentine’s Day movie slate is an important one. “The date movie” is a concept we’re all familiar with, which, on one of the most markedly consumerist holidays of the year, is a concept that is emphasized two-fold. Movies like The Notebook and No Strings Attached immediately come to mind. Last year, audiences were graced (or cursed) with the romantically marketed Fifty Shades of Grey, which opened the very weekend we’re talking about now. Then there’s Garry Marshall’s ensemble romantic comedy Valentine’s Day, which was released Valentine’s Day weekend of 2010, and He’s Just Not That Into You in 2009. You can pretty much guess the summaries of these films from the titles.
This year, audiences are offered three wildly disparate films to choose how to spend their night: Zoolander 2, Marvel’s Deadpool, and How To Be Single. Not the most conventional of fares. But it got me thinking — Zoolander 2 and Deadpool aren’t really stereotypical date movies at all— which means maybe we’re moving out of classically defined romance models. Maybe you don’t have to take her out to a candlelight dinner and then watch a movie about boy meeting girl, boy losing girl, boy getting girl back anymore. Which is fine. The end of the “date movie” as we’ve known it isn’t necessarily an establishment that needs mourning (although I’ll get to that in a second).
However, I did find issues with the idea of Warner Brother’s female ensemble comedy How To Be Single. I must admit, I’m writing this column having not seen the film. But I really don’t want to. Something about it fundamentally sits wrong with me.
In the film, Alice (Dakota Johnson) is newly single and can’t seem to figure out the dating world. Robin (Rebel Wilson) appears as her funny-man best friend who also tells her how precisely wrong she’s going about men and dating. Wilson makes fun of Johnson’s shaving habits (or lack thereof), Johnson seems to be incapable of talking to men at a bar and texting appropriately. Apparently, hilarity ensues. This is the trailer audiences are given that’s supposed to make us want to see the movie.
Don’t get me wrong, I am one of the world’s biggest romantic comedy fans. I grew up on a steady diet of Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron. The death and rebirth of the traditional romantic comedy requires a whole other article altogether. But amid those classics (When Harry Met Sally, Something’s Gotta Give, etc.), some films have emerged that perpetuate a certain classification of the female identity. That is: the young, single white female, that just can’t get a date or doesn’t know how to, or will be, for all intents and purposes, alone forever.
It’s apparent in Katherine Heigl’s 27 Dresses character, who pines obsessively after her boss but can never manage to tell him (“always the bridesmaid, never the bride”). Furthermore, Kristin Wiig’s character in Bridesmaids accepts continual mistreatment from handsome Jon Hamm because she can’t seem to value herself enough to look for better. In The Wedding Date, Debra Messing plays such a single woman that she has to hire a male escort for a wedding because she has too much anxiety about showing up alone. And even Bridget Jones (Renee Zellwegger), as much as I love her, pretty much screws up every encounter she has with a man, enough so that Mr. Darcy has to proclaim at one point (lovingly, but also pointedly) that he likes her “just as she is.”
This was a conception I grew up with as a kid, and I took it at face value. I thought that that was just the nature of the game, growing up as an American woman in the 21st century, you were probably going to be single and frustrated for much of your young adult life, until you met “the one.” But up until that point, when the guy sweeps you off your feet, and you live happily ever after, things were going to be slow going.
I accepted that fate because of what was placed on the screen in front of me, and then, lo and behold, I was shocked to learn that none of it was true. I’m not about to go into the specifics of my dating life because that’s not the point of this column. The point is, I realized that the concept of the single woman I had been spoon-fed by studios and executives from a very young age just wasn’t accurate. Sure, we’re all single at some point, and we’re all awkward to one another, but this concept of being so desolate and downtrodden in life and love just rings false. I’ve thought a lot about this idea recently — as I get older I’ve come to grapple with just how much the media warps and disfigures our brains into thinking certain inventions are reality. And this stereotype is one that I’ve really railed against.
I don’t know if the formula has been immortalized by the insecure male executive looking to put women one more rung lower on the ladder in the age-old battle of man versus woman. Or maybe a group of out-of-touch studio heads thought simply that these movies would appeal to women, because women “are like that.” And for the most part they do appeal. I know I love many of them deeply and count them as some of my favorite movies. But they also damage. They inform a legion of young, susceptible young girls that this is the type of treatment they should expect, and perhaps worse, accept.
There’s of course nothing I can do about the films of the past (and the one coming this weekend) but going forward, I will be conscious of these preconceived notions when making my films. I hope you will be too.

USC Thornton Opera presented a concert reading of the new opera Frau Schindler written by composer Thomas Morse and librettist Ken Cazan. The performance was held in Newman Recital Hall Feb. 5.
The opera presents the experiences and tribulations of Oskar Schindler’s wife, Emilie, during her and Oskar’s attempts to save over a thousand Jewish prisoners during the Holocaust. The show presents many of the same issues portrayed in the Steven Spielberg’s Academy Award-winning film Schindler’s List, though through the lens of Emilie’s perspective. In the program notes, Morse states, “Frau Schindler, a serious opera, portrays the psychology of the times — how people were able to turn things around in their minds in order to rationalize and live with their actions.”
Cazan, who also serves as resident stage director of USC Thornton Opera, first became involved with the project when he was approached by a colleague of Morse, asking if he was interested in participating in the project. Though Friday’s performance was only a concert reading of the opera, Frau Schindler is expected to make its European debut sometime within the winter/spring 2017 season.
Overall, the performance was sung well. Students within the Vocal Arts program sang a majority of the roles, though two guest artists were hired to sing Emilie and Oskar. In the titular role, mezzo-soprano Blythe Gaissert sang with a plush, rich tone, though her sound was sometimes lost over the orchestra as she approached her lower register. Baritone Troy Cook, as Oskar, posseses a velvety sound that was seamless from top to bottom. Both artists successfully interpreted their respective roles.
As Marthe Marker, a Jewish prisoner hired as a maid by the Schindler’s, soprano Alyssa Wills sang with a distinct timbre that is both sweet and full. She sounded especially delightful in her upper register. Her duet with Gaissert in Act III was among the most touching moment of the evening.
Mezzo-soprano Katie Beck performed the role of Frau Von Daubek, stepping in as a last minute replacement for soprano Yelena Dyachek. Beck, who triumphed as Sesto is last semester’s production of Mozart’s La Clemenza di Tito, once again delivered a phenomenally sung, albeit brief, performance.
More information regarding future performances with USC Thornton Opera can be found online.

“I need some of my lubricant,” Boulevards announced midway through his show, taking a swig of his water. With no further pause—that having been the longest all night—the singer counted off his next number, a beat as tight as his leather pants. Boulevards collided with the crowd at the Natural History Museum on Friday with a sheer energy that kept all on their feet and moving at all times.
The sold-out show was the first set of a double-billing with The Hood Internet at the most recent installment of the museum’s First Fridays series. Boulevards, an alias of singer-songwriter Jamil Rashad, delivered an unforgettable set of just over 30 minutes. Supercharged drummer Jacob Tomsky and guitarist Leroy Clampitt joined the singer.
The band filled the room with adrenaline, each song punchier and a more compelling invitation to dance than the last. Attendees found themselves restless for more funk in the mere seconds between songs, and Boulevards delivered. At the concert’s end, leaving the museum generated withdrawal symptoms from the lack of Groove! — the title of the Raleigh, N.C. artist’s forthcoming LP.
Boulevards’ style is best, and inadequately, self-described as “funk.” Thick synth patches and low-low bass guide the feet of even the shyest listener to dance. The band’s sound invokes the dark intensity of the Black Keys with the rhythmic compel of Disclosure, but in a style entirely of its own. The artist’s hardcore and metal influences cut through in instrumental sections with close rhythmic interplay in the band. Boulevards never lets his rock-solid backbeat die, leaving the audience at the mercy of the dancing impulse. And the singer’s vocal skill in a live performance in no way falls short of that captured on his recorded tracks, including a 2015 eponymous EP.
Boulevards has clearly been around the block. He effortlessly delivered powerful lyrics and interacted naturally with the audience, seemingly directing the band with only his body. As the music picked up, Boulevards discarded his encumbrances one by one: first the mic stand, then his jacket. His irrepressible sexual charisma is essential to his act, which combines the obligatory hip-thrusting of the funk genre with lyrics that range from bashfully charming (“I’m sorry for the cold call, but you got it all”) to downright cocky (“Turn down the lights, don’t act surprised, your love is mine”). The songs make reliable party jams, but Boulevards’ lyrics and the tightness of the arrangements also warrant a close listen. Currently, Boulevards has only released an eponymous EP and the single, “Cold Call.”
The crowd was a hodge-podge of upperclassmen dressed to go clubbing after the show and older museum patrons who appeared to be out of their element and loving it. They were not prepared for the intensity of Boulevards. The band’s performance conveyed a frenetic rhythmic urge that might be unfamiliar to Angelenos accustomed to EDM. Even so, singable, infectious choruses render Boulevards an instant favorite to longtime funk and R&B fans and partygoers alike.
The full LP Groove! comes out April 1.

Women’s water polo opened its season with big wins against UC San Diego at home on Friday and away at Whittier on Saturday. The Trojans came away with a 2-0 record to kick off their 2016 campaign to the championships, winning 17-4 against UC San Diego and 28-2 against Whittier.
The Women of Troy hosted UC San Diego Friday and opened up with a 4-0 lead with goals from junior driver Stephania Haralibidis, sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey, junior driver Nikki Stansfield and sophomore utility Annika Jensen. The Tritons answered back with a power play goal. Sophomore goalie Victoria Chamorro and the Trojan defense left UC San Diego scoreless for the next 10-plus minutes of play.

It was a great week for USC athletics, dominating UCLA on the hardwood and closing emphatically on National Signing Day. While an entire column could, and will, be written on the resurgence of USC basketball, USC’s incredible triumph on signing day deserves major recognition and applause.
I was among the many Trojan faithful who were concerned in the weeks leading up to National Signing Day, as USC’s class looked top heavy at skill positions and practically barren on the lines. Coupled with a relatively new staff, there were legitimate fears that this year’s football class could have been disastrously thin.
Instead, USC finished with tremendous flourish, reminding everyone the power of the Trojan brand and giving coach Helton a major achievement as he enters his first spring at the helm of the Trojan football program. Helton and the rest of his recently assembled staff pulled off an almost perfect National Signing Day, closing on targets all across the country, flipping commitments from top tier schools and securing Letters of Intent from every commit they had entering the day.
As I noted last week, recruiting isn’t everything. Steve Sarkisian is the perfect example of this notion as he had phenomenal signing days the previous two years and was not able to capitalize on his success. I have a feeling Helton will be different.
In contrast to the over-the-top, one-of-a-kind event that went on at the University of Michigan last Wednesday, Helton went about his success in a workmanlike way. His ability to constantly redirect attention back to the players and the program is well appreciated by fans and athletes alike. Unlike the former two coaches, who were unfortunately the focus of the program, under the Helton regime players and on-the-field performance will receive their due attention as well.
Helton had every chance to stand up and pat his own back for the work he and his staff did on Wednesday, but instead he took the humble approach and instead congratulated his staff and his players. There is a lot of talk about Helton’s unwavering attention and devotion to each player on the roster and how much that is respected in the locker room. Fans caught a glimpse of that on Wednesday, and it was a refreshing moment, contrasted with what has gone on in the past.
It wouldn’t have been nearly as enjoyable if USC didn’t come out on top on Signing Day, but the combination of the two is practically unbeatable. The Trojans were able to go deep into Georgia, prying physical and athletic lineman E.J. Price out of Dawg nation, leaving the Georgia faithful stunned at Price’s choice. Price has the size and agility to develop into an anchor on the line.
Pete Carroll emphasized going across the country to find recruits in every state, and that focus produced stalwarts like Mike Williams, Brian Cushing, Keith Rivers and Dwayne Jarrett. In his first class, Helton demonstrated a propensity for similar recruiting behavior. In addition to Price, the Trojans were able to snag physically imposing Jahmel Cook, a prospect at safety, and Keyshawn Young out of Miami. Cook was a commit to Florida State, so getting him to switch was even sweeter.
The Trojan brand extended beyond the South, securing a Hawaii native and Oregon commit Vavae Malepeai, a highly touted tailback. The fact that he will be attending USC is even sweeter as it saves Trojan fans from watching him torch the USC defense as a Duck for the next three or four years.
Across the board, USC was excellent, filling all of their gaping holes and allowing the team to further recover from a roster that was once threadbare from sanctions. The team was somewhat restricted by the blue shirts, players from last year’s class, that count against this year’s numbers. Even so, the program was able to compile a standout class that will help propel the Trojans into a new era, free of distractions and sanctions, where the team can get back to playing football.
Recruiting classes don’t mean everything. Player development and in game schematics are still exceptionally important. However, having better talent makes everything else a lot easier. Helton and the rest of the staff still have to put a quality product on the field, but for now they have passed their first test with flying colors. For that, Helton deserves a pat on the back, and since he is not the type of coach who will do it himself, everyone else in the Trojan nation should.

With LMU’s Lukas Moenter’s forehand falling short into the net, USC freshman Logan Smith wrapped up a 3-6 6-2 6-3 win, clinching the match with a 4-0 lead for the Trojans. The dual match finished with a score of 6-1, the same score the Men of Troy defeated Grand Canyon University with Saturday morning. These two convincing wins brought the sixth-ranked Trojans to 5-0 on the season.
Freshman Jack Jaede and Laurens Verboven, along with Smith, carried a heavy workload, playing in both singles matches on the day. Jaede clinched the first match for USC against GCU with a 6-4, 6-4 win before defeating LMU’s Alex Bourgeois in a dominating fashion, 6-0, 6-1.
Senior captain Max De Vroome followed Jaede against LMU in a quick 6-2, 6-2 victory with his opponent Cristobal Rivera struggling to return his serve all match. Verboven suffered a tight loss against GCU, falling 10-8 in a third set tiebreaker but was able to bounce back and win 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the second match of the day.
After winning the doubles point against Grand Canyon, the Trojans’ top-ranked player Nick Crystal won his match at the No. 1 singles spot, 6-2, 6-4, bringing his overall record to 13-6 on the year including 3-1 in dual matches.
Sophomore Thibault Forget also quickly beat his opponent Mathieu Rajaonah 6-3, 6-3, before Jaede’s clincher at line 5.
The three remaining matches all split the first two sets, with 10-point tiebreaker being used to decide the victor. Henry Ji, playing in his first dual match of the season, cruised to a 10-4 victory to seal his match, while Smith edged out a 10-8 battle. Verboven was the lone Trojan to fall to the Lopes after his tiebreak defeat.
The Men of Troy showed no signs of fatigue in the following match, despite it starting quickly after their dismantling of Grand Canyon.
After Jaede and de Vroome’s straight set victories, Smith was able to come back strong in the second set to lead to his third set clincher. Freshman Jake Devine finished off his third set with a 6-4 victory to put the Trojans up 6-0 in the match. The Trojans’ sole loss was junior Rob Bellamy, who played a tiebreaker to decide the match,, which he lost 10-8, after losing a close 7-5 first set then winning the second 7-6.
Overall USC continues to look strong on the year. Concerns about losing four of their top six players have been all but forgotten with the stellar play of the freshmen on the team as well as other underclassmen who have stepped up into more prominent roles. Returners Crystal and de Vroome have also been key with their play on the court and leadership off of it.
Due to the Trojans’ victory two weekends ago in the ITA Kick-off weekend hosted at Mark’s Stadium, they will be traveling to Charlottesville, Virginia next weekend to compete in the 16-school ITA National Team Indoor Championships. The Trojans were runners-up in the event last year and hope to have similar success in a strong field including three of last year’s final four teams — defending champions Virginia as well as Oklahoma and Baylor.
To even lose one match to Grand Canyon is lame. This team is ranked way too high, and no mention of the women getting swept by Florida 7 – 0 is disgraceful having been ranked #2 preseason .

The men’s volleyball team split a weekend road trip with a four-set loss at No. 11 UC Irvine on Friday night and then a four-set win at UC San Diego on Saturday night.
The Trojans battled UC Irvine 24-26, 25-2, 18-25, 18-25 but bounced back the next day for a victory over UCSD 25-19, 26-24, 19-25, 25-22.
UC Irvine (3-7, 2-6) remains 10th in the MPSF, USC (2-8, 2-6) 11th and UC San Diego (3-9, 0-8) 12th.
Saturday’s win was the first road victory of the year for the Trojans. Four players finished with at least nine kills while senior outside hitter and captain Alex Slaught led with twelve kills, and senior middle blocker Tommy Leonard and sophomore opposite Jon Rivera each posted eleven. Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh tagged on nine more while hitting a team-high .533.
As a team, the Trojans’ hitting looked shaky at times. Although they hit .364 in the second set, they posted a meager .091 average in the first and .194 in the third. For the match, the team hit .229.
The Tritons hit .211 and star junior outside hitter Ian Colbert was limited to nine kills on 26 attempts. Only one Triton, senior outside hitter Kirill Rudenko recorded double-digit kills (11).
Hitting-wise, Friday’s match was more or less the same for the Trojans, but they faced a UCI team that was on fire.
The Trojans hit .274 despite a stellar .560 in the first set. Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder and Rivera tied for a team high thirteen kills.
Across the net, UC Irvine hit .457 for the match without their star player and kills leader, first-team All-American sophomore opposite Tamir Hershko. Even without Hershko, the Anteaters still managed to field four players with at least eleven kills.
Two freshmen, opposite Apfelbach and outside hitter Tucker Pikula, both had career nights. In addition to his sixteen kills, Apfelbach hit .500 and added five digs and five blocks. Pikula added twelve kills on a .524 average and tallied eight digs and a pair of blocks.
On both Friday and Saturday, the Trojans lost the blocking battle. Coming into the weekend, the team had a total of 55 blocks while allowing 101 to opponents. However, these weekend matches seemed like chances to turn that ratio around as both UC Irvine and UC San Diego have struggled blocking, as well. The Anteaters entered Friday’s match with only 54 blocks and the Tritons began Saturday’s match with 61.
Nevertheless, UC Irvine held USC to only three blocks in four sets. This enabled the Anteaters to control the pace of the match and hit .457. Then on Saturday, UCSD out-blocked the Trojans 13-8.
Up next for the Men of Troy is a four-game home stand. All four matches will be against ranked opponents. First up this Wednesday is No.12 Cal State Northridge (7-4, 2-4), a team that beat USC 3-1 in their MPSF opener. On Friday, USC will look to pull off the upset versus No. 2 Long Beach State (9-2, 6-2), who also beat the Trojans 3-1 in mid-January. Next week, USC will finish the homestand with two matches against No. 5 Hawaii (9-2, 4-2).

Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
Just last month, 48 states released their 2015 budgets, revealing that a majority of states reported an increase in funding for state colleges and universities, according to an Illinois State University finding. While this may seem like good news, skyrocketing tuition begs the question of whether the increase can solve the problem that currently persists in public higher education. State funding alone does not indicate a sustainable source of support for these universities; the government should rather employ a number of different efforts to help defray the burden of tuition.
In 1969, a year’s worth of tuition at a public university in the United States was around $1,200, in current dollars, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. For the 2006-2007 school year, average tuition at a public university is just over $11,000. Since the 1970s, college tuition has been increasing steadily — almost 6 percent faster than the rate of inflation, according to professor Ray Franke at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. Thus, it is clear that rising inflation does not justify the exorbitant tuition hikes.
Increased state funding could help our public universities but the efforts are not a permanent solution, primarily due to the way we view college. More and more students are choosing to go to college, even as these institutions are now seen as less of a “subsidized public good” and more of a “competitive market good,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Katharine C. Lyall, former president of the University of Wisconsin System, coined this phrase to explain the shift in financial responsibility from public to private, which assumes that most are willing to invest in the hefty cost of college for the market value that it possesses in the workforce. But since states do not have the resources to take that responsibility on themselves, the matter is left in the hands of students. Therefore, if some students want their share of the “competitive market good” but do not have the money to attend the school that would benefit them the most, they might end up settling for college options that are only financially sound — and not be able to take advantage of the resources that a college education provides.
So, the recent news about increases in state funding is not necessarily a cause for celebration. The increased spending is a reaction to the end of the recession, the same way the spending cuts were a reaction to the recession. Even though 39 states cite that they have increased funding for higher education continuously for the 2015-2016 year, nine states reported a decrease. The need for a better system is apparent in just this inequality; even as the nation’s economy improves, nearly 20 percent of its states are unable to increase funding for their secondary school systems.
Reactionary measures to double-digit inflation in our national economy were primary motivators for cutting state funding in the 1970s. While a recovering economy has boosted most of the public university systems in the United States, the volatility of the economy has not worked in the favor of our public schools, and letting this system control the majority of the funding that they receive is unfair to the citizens at large. Public education cannot rely on funding that is so susceptible to changes in government policy.
Rather than leaving it in the hands of the states, the issue of funding is probably better handled by a greater power — the federal government. As Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed in his presidential campaign, standardizing university tuition in each state would create a more balanced and steady flow of resources. Countries in Europe are already one step ahead, with the governments of Germany, Finland and Sweden, among others, already offering free education funded by taxpayers. But since the population of the United States is bigger, it is not feasible for taxpayers to be the source of funding for the nation’s college students. Instead, Sanders wants to place a tax on Wall Street to fund the $75 billion cost. A plan like this would alleviate the burden of college tuition on the general population. By creating a nation of free secondary education, this would establish a system where colleges would compete by increasing the quality of their education, rather than their costs.
While tuition at public universities would not directly affect private research institutions like USC, it would profoundly affect fellow students at the UC system. Moreover, if costs in the UC system decreased, along with costs of public school systems in different states, it would provide significant incentive for private schools to lower their tuition costs to make themselves competitive. Putting higher education’s finances in the hands of the federal government would alleviate the financial burden that colleges currently place on students.

Every year, February rolls around and people in the United States scramble. We scramble because we’re thinking of how to celebrate Black History Month in a way that acknowledges the significance of the month.
We know that it’s coming, but after 40 years of its official designation, it can sometimes seem like the month has just become another default holiday. That’s why The New York Times put a twist on commemorating the accomplishments of African Americans in this country. The Times said it will release one previously unpublished photograph a day from its archives along with the back story to the image. This comes as part of the Times’ new project “Unpublished Black History,” an effort to further the conversation about race.
The decision to celebrate Black History Month with photographs shows that images hold a prominent place in our understanding of the black experience in America. Yet, to a generation of millennials, constantly inundated with images, these photos will be a test to the resilience of a month whose significance is sometimes not fully understood.
Millennials are among the first batch of students who have been celebrating Black History Month since elementary school. Therefore, millennials of all races have an institutional understanding of the major players in the black experience: Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr. and Thurgood Marshall are among some of the greats.
This textbook knowledge can unfortunately foster apathy. The reasons behind why we celebrate the month can fade. Luckily, that’s why we have photos, right?
Many experts argue that the civil rights movement resonated with so many Americans because pictures of dogs mauling demonstrators and millions of people attending the March on Washington became imprinted into the American psyche. They continued to be passed down to help inform our understanding of the black experience in America.
For our generation, we have a different relationship to images. They remain key to understanding the world and how it is changing.
In the time it took me to write this column, I sent at least three selfies on Snapchat, just because. I instinctively refreshed my Facebook feed and saw what my friends were doing through their photos and captions. All of us see more images in a day than any previous generation. The overflow of images can make them seem vapid.
The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism lecturer Miki Turner is a photojournalist who has worked with JET and Ebony and grew up during the civil rights movement.
“There’s been a shift in empathy,” Turner said. “I don’t think we’re as raw as we used to be, which is kind of crazy when you think about it.”
The Times’ photo project will be a test to us millennials about how much our psyche can still be penetrated.
In the past year, we have seen disturbing videos and pictures of African Americans being shot, tackled by police officers or made victims of crime. There is outrage. There is commentary. But these instances just don’t seem to move the needle like they did just 50 years ago.
“When I think about some of the photos I saw in Ebony and JET as a kid, some of them just made you want to lose your lunch,” Turner said. “But today I don’t think we go there as much. It’s happening, though, because of smartphones, so we’re not so dependent on the still image as we were back then because you get the video.”
The still image has power if we allow it.
In the week since the Times released its project, there have been photographs of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play major league baseball in the modern era, and a series of photos of James Baldwin, famed African American novelist and essayist.
The one that was most striking, however, is a black-and-white photograph of a young African-American girl and white boy writing together on a chalkboard. It was taken shortly into the wake of schools being integrated. The kids couldn’t have been older than 10-years-old, but they encompassed the climate of of a rapidly changing culture.
The photograph helped me  put a human face to what I knew from my history classes. It helped me connect to the distant moment.
It can be the same for all of us. If we are willing to pause and look, we millennials will realize the power images can still command over us.
Time will tell how much these photographs will impact us. Documentation is needed to record history, so if this project does nothing else, it will help us write another page into Black History Month.
Use these next weeks to make February much more than that. The Times is giving you the photos — now do something with them.
After reading “Wait An L.A. Minute” on Tuesdays, join Jordyn Holman in her millennial conversations on Twitter @JordynJournals. She’s a senior studying print and digital journalism.

As spring draws near, Southern California will be playing host to many music festivals. Here’s a list of the top few you should be looking forward to in the coming months! 
This festival will be the highlight of Valentine’s Day for EDM fans. Insomniac is bringing in a stellar lineup for this one-night festival. Headliner Dash Berlin, a top EDM DJ, is known as a super performer who has closed out EDC Las Vegas for the last several years. A second act includes trap lord DJ Borgeous, whose hits like “My Sweet Summer” and “This Could be Love” have hit the radio stations as top playing songs. Known as a great stage performer and very interactive with the crowds, Borgeous is a must see at Crush. 
One personal favorite of mine that will be playing at Crush is Tritonal. Currently famous for their collaboration with Cash Cash on “Surrender” and the Chainsmokers on “Until You Were Gone,” this DJ duo is sure to play some radio favorites alongside some great festival remixes. 
March will bring another Insomniac festival favorite with Beyond Wonderland SoCal. On March 18 and 19, L.A. will be inundated with some crowd-favorite DJs. 
One of my favorite DJ duos will be at Beyond this year with their crazy and bass heavy beats. The Dutch trap group Yellowclaw will be bringing their high-energy performance, and will hopefully perform one of my favorite songs “Shotgun-Remix.”
For a more low-key experience at this festival, there will be trance and house music galore. Performers like Deorro and Alesso are big names that will be bringing a more techno-trance feel that will be paired with an impressive lights performance that will enhance the overall EDM experience for attendees. 
Beyond Wonderland will also play host to other amazing DJ’s like Seven Lions, Galantis, Sleepy Tom (known for his collaboration with Diplo on “Be Right There”) and many more. 
Deciding what festivals to attend this spring will be a difficult feat with so many great options here in Southern California. Insomniac is hosting two huge festivals that will bring some of the best EDM artists to the fans here in L.A. Tickets can be purchased online through the Insomniac website. 
We couldn’t have an article about spring music festivals without recognizing one of the nation’s largest. The Coachella Valley of California will be hosting its famous music festival April 15 – 17 and April 22 – 24. 
Acts at Coachella this year span a huge range of genres, from rap to EDM to alternative. Headliners include Calvin Harris, A$AP Rocky, Zedd and rock heroes Guns N Roses. 
With huge artists headlining, it’s important to recognize the smaller acts that will be performing as well. Music newcomer Halsey will be performing with hits like “New Americana,” her hit single this year. 
One gem to definitely check out is Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. This band will bring favorites like “Home” to the stage with their classically effortless folk-rock sound. Also vibing out will be some festival favorites like Purity Ring, James Bay, Matt and Kim and The 1975.
Stagecoach will once again be sweeping into Indio, California this late spring. From April 29 to May 1, California’s largest country music festival will be hosting some favorites. Headliners include America’s sweetheart Carrie Underwood and two country heartthrobs, Luke Bryan and Eric Church. 
Aside from the major acts, Stagecoach will be bringing a plethora of other artists. Little Big Town will be attending alongside a classic favorite The Doobie Brothers.
Country’s hottest pop-crossover, Sam Hunt will be performing a menagerie of his radio hit songs like “Make You Miss Me” and “House Party.”
