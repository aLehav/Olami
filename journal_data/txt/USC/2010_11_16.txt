In hopes of making job-seeking community members more self-sufficient, two USC employees organized the second annual USC Professional Clothing Drive.
The clothing drive, which lasts until Dec. 17 and is sponsored by USC Employee Recruitment Services, USC Civic and Community Relations and the Southeast L.A-Crenshaw WorkSource Center, is a chance for USC to give back to the community, said Hector Ramos, a recruitment specialist who is co-leading the drive.
“The objective of this annual clothing drive is for the USC community  …  to have the chance to contribute to the welfare and well being of our extended community here in South Los Angeles,” Ramos wrote in an e-mail. “In the spirit of the holidays, this is an opportunity for the Trojans to make a difference and give back to the community in which we live, work and learn.”
The Southeast L.A.-Crenshaw WorkSource Center hosts numerous programs aimed at helping the community in time of need. The job readiness program helps the local unemployed find and keep jobs to provide stability. Participants in the program will be able to benefit from the clothing drive, Ramos said.
“The clothing collected from this professional clothing drive will be donated to the local WorkSource Center in order to give community job seekers and residents a competitive advantage when they show up for their next job interview,” Ramos said.
Phil Barajas, an employee at the WorkSource Center, said the clothing donated to the center reaches many people.
“This year we helped hundreds of people, from security officers that need to wear a dark suit all week, to someone that needs a blazer to interview,” Barajas said.
The clothing drive is in response to the rising unemployment rate in the last couple of years and the fact that many who are seeking jobs are not equipped to purchase professional business attire for interviews, Ramos said.
“Over 100 community job seekers took advantage of last year’s clothing drive. And of those 100, 50 job seekers ended up finding full-time employment,” Ramos said.
Diana Seyb, personnel specialist for employee recruitment and leader of the clothing drive, said she was amazed by the participation last year.
“It was amazing to see so many USC retirees donating clothing and supporting our efforts to provide professional clothing to the surrounding USC communities for both campuses,” Seyb said.
The initial idea for clothing donations was inspired by neckties at the WorkSource Center, Barajas said.
“When I started working here last year, there were a couple of ties to give out to clients. I thought. Why not bring my clothing I am not using to help the clients?” Barajas said.
He recruited his colleagues to do the same, the idea of the clothing drive evolved from there, he said.
USC’s involvement in the clothing drive began with David Brown, talent acquisition supervisor for employee recruitment, Ramos said. When approaching the WorkSource Center, Brown asked how the USC community could support them. Their reply was for professional clothing for their clients.
“David began thinking about it and realized that he had lots of high-quality professional attire that he no longer wore and it would be helpful to give them to someone who could use them,” Ramos said.
Donations will be accepted from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays until Dec. 17, excluding Nov. 26. Bins are located on the University Park Campus in the Employee Recruitment Services office, Figueroa Building room 100, and on the Health Sciences Campus in the Civic Community Relations office, Keith Administration Building basement and room 420.

Bill Nye, known for his television show Bill Nye the Science Guy, spoke to a full Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday night about climate and global changes with his signature humor.
Now you know · Many students said they attended the event because Nye, who spoke Tuesday, was a huge influence during their childhood years. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
During the lecture, Nye fainted but woke up shortly after.
“What happened?  How long was I out?” Nye said after standing up. “Wow, that was crazy. I feel like Lady Gaga or something.”
Though Nye was visibly shaken, leaning on the podium for support and eventually sitting down, he finished his lecture.
“The joy of discovery, my friends, is what science is all about,” Nye said.
Nye discussed mainly climate change and the issue of rapid global warming, but drew on examples from the climate of Venus to North Dakota windmills.
“This is not, as I like to say, rocket surgery. This is people not paying attention to what’s going on,” Nye said.
Addressing the audience as the “climate change generation,” Nye presented students with facts and solutions for the current climate situation and emphasized students’ abilities to change the world, particularly through technology.
“You guys can invent technology that could — dare I say it? — change the world,” Nye told the audience.
Nye balanced the lecture with humor and facts. Nye spoke in dramatic voices and one-liners, reminiscent of his popular television show.
Audience members applauded Nye for resuming his lecture after fainting.
“He kept trying to finish his speech though it was clear he was really woozy, and he did finish from a chair. What a trooper,” said Pierre Tasci, a sophomore majoring in engineering.
After the lecture, the audience gave a standing ovation and chanted “Bill,” a tribute to his show’s theme song.
Bill Nye the Science Guy, ran on PBS from 1993 to 1997. The popular show aimed at teaching different scientific concepts to its audience.
“I remember the little episodes; it was all do-it-yourself, [so] you didn’t need a kit.  I remember the funny voices he did, his kid helpers, the cool sets he had … I wondered how things worked, and he explained it,” Sidhom said.
Corrine Tom, a junior majoring in biomedical engineering, said she would love to have Nye as a professor, and enjoyed his lecture.
“I thought it was really awesome; really seeing him in person was wonderful,” Tom said.
“[The lecture] was interesting — he brought in a lot of stuff from the show, like quirky voices. It was really cool to see one of my childhood heroes,” Sam Lin, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering, said.
The event was organized by the USG Program Board’s Speakers Committee and Academic Culture Assembly. Nye’s lecture lasted about 45 minutes, but the question-and-answer session was cancelled because of concerns about his health.
Some students lined up more than five hours before the doors opened just to see Nye speak.
“I love Bill Nye.  He taught me English … and science, too.  I’m ready, front and center,” Richard Sidhom, a freshman majoring in philosophy, policy, and law.
Sidhom was the first student in line, arriving at Bovard at 1:45 p.m.
Arya Shah, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, had been in line since 3:30 p.m.
“He’s my hero. My dad used to tape all his shows for me,” Shah said. “I loved him.”
Program Board organizers said Nye fainted because of exhaustion, but was not taken to the hospital.
“He’s doing fine,” said Frank Chen, director of Program Board’s Academic Culture Assembly. “He’s OK right now.”
great…. and usc makes failblog

To those who are criticizing the audience and USC’s response:
I was sitting in the audience and the reason why the news outlets are reporting that people didn’t immediately respond is because Bill was down for about 10 seconds and the entire audience initially thought it was part of his comical presentation. He got back up on his own and insisted on continuing the final fourth of his presentation. As soon as it was determined that he was seriously in danger, he was offered assistance. At the end, he was taken backstage and immediately offered food and given professional medical attention. USC and all of the students and staff in attendance did the best job they could have done given the unexpectedness of the incident and Bill’s desire to fight on and finish the speech. I know I speak on behalf of the entire Trojan family when I say that we are incredibly supportive of Bill and are deeply concerned about his health.  
Please take the time to understand the situation before accusing the university or its students of inaction.
I was there, close to the front. It wasn’t that no one was willing to help, everyone was very concerned, but because he is such a funny guy we all didn’t know what was happening– if he had fainted, had something more serious, or if it was part of the performance. It became clear that he had really fainted, but because he was only down for 10 seconds we were all really shocked and not sure what do to. And everyone around me made an effort to not tweet, post it on facebook, or take pictures out of respect. This guy was our hero, and a big part of our childhood. Don’t accuse us of being careless spectators, when students were the ones that called out for him to get a chair, food, and water.
It’s happening  everywhere.  I can’t explain the young generation actions. To begin with devices should not be allowed as cameras are not allowed in the court room.
I am embarrassed and horrified at our younger generation.  What is wrong with you people.  To busy to help out a fellow human being?  He could have died while all of you were sitting there tweeting or taking pictures.  You should all be expelled!!
There wasn’t really anybody tweeting and taking pictures when he fainted. that was a deliberate exaggeration by one person who was quoted by all the internet news sources. He was only down for a couple seconds, then he hopped right back up. the fact that the event staff did not react to it initiially made it seem like part of the act. his presentation had been so energetic that it seemed totally plausible.
I agree with you, Embarrassed.  The fact that an audience of students, many if not most of whom had no EMT training, didn’t rush the stage to help a person who they were not sure was actually in trouble is definitely grounds for expulsion.  If it was an older generation of audience members, I’m sure they would have jumped out of their seats and sprinted to the fallen speaker in the 10 seconds he was down.  Having dozens of people who can’t do anything to help standing around certainly would not have caused any problems for the people who are actually there to help!  I guess the younger generation just has to settle for doing reasonable things, like calling for help and telling him to sit down when he insisted on standing, which is exactly what we did when we saw one of our childhood heroes in trouble.

So Alastair, I was hoping at the end of your sentence you would have said something to the effect of;
“…as I rushed to his aid”
but perhaps you also were too busy tweeting?
Congratulations, Jennifer, you have mastered the one-sentence paragraph.

USC was given a grade of B-minus in late October for its efforts at promoting and achieving environmental sustainability on campus, a slight improvement from the C-plus the university had previously received for three years in a row.
Going green · Charlie Furman (left), a senior majoring in cinema-television critical studies, and Danielle Romero, a freshman majoring in business administration, make windmills for USC Beyond Coal, which is calling on USC to stop using coal-fueled power. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan 
The College Sustainability Report Card is an annual assessment by the Sustainability Endowments Institute, a non-profit organization founded in 2005 that attempts to further sustainability on college campuses, by commenting on their environmental efforts.
USC officials acknowledged a lag in sustainability efforts at USC.
“[The grading system] is a complicated set of things. USC has been doing better. We’ve been sort of behind the curve on sustainability issues, but we’re catching up,” said Mark Bernstein, managing director of USC’s Energy Institute.
The report evaluates colleges and universities on their performance in nine aspects of sustainability policies and practices: administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, green building, student involvement, transportation, endowment transparency, investment priorities and shareholder engagement.
Bernstein said that USC is not performing as well as its competitors — Stanford University received an A-minus and UCLA received a B — but the university has been making strides to become more environmentally sustainable.
“We haven’t been a leader [but] we’re not at the bottom. We’re kind of in the middle of the pack,” he said. “We’ve been doing a pretty good job overall.”
The institute gave USC an A in four categories: administration, food and recycling, transportation, and investment priorities.
According to the report card, 40 percent of USC students commute to campus via “environmentally preferable methods,” and the university spends more than 5 percent of its food budget on local products and purchases organic food items.
The university received its lowest grade, an F, in shareholder engagement.
According to the institute, the details of proxy voting — the process by which a university considers and votes on policies regarding climate change and other related issues — are handled by USC’s investment managers rather than a “shareholder responsibility committee,” which would involve students, faculty and alumni input.
In climate change and energy, green building, and endowment transparency, the university received C grades.
USC has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent since 2001. In addition, 14 percent of the electricity purchased for campus comes from renewable sources, according to the report card.
This is in comparison with Stanford University, which received an A in climate change and energy, and aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 20 percent before 2020.
“We really need to push the envelope on reducing energy consumption. We need to do our own solar installations and take a serious look at water consumption,” Bernstein said.
USC Beyond Coal — a group committed to reducing the university’s dependence on coal — has been active in promoting sustainability through its work with USC administration, said Carrell Hambrick, a senior majoring in fine arts who is involved in the group.
Last year, the group lobbied then-President Steven B. Sample to write a letter to L.A. Department of Water and Power expressing USC’s support of the Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa commitment to ending the city’s dependence on coal by 2020.
Hambrick said the university is in a good position to take action to improve its sustainability because of its resources.
“We can be doing so much for sustainability,” she said. “The fact that we have a sustainability department is a really good sign, and [the fact that] we have 11 environmental groups on campus shows that this has been thought about a lot.”
Despite these myriad opportunities, Hambrick said USC’s overall grade of B-minus was fitting because the university could be making better use of its own resources.
“It’s a pretty fair assessment. At the end of the day, if we do want to advance our sustainability portfolio, the university has to be more diplomatic,” Hambrick said.
Rosie Murphy, a freshman majoring in history also involved in USC Beyond Coal, expressed similar sentiments that the university has made progress but can continue to do more to be a leader.
“USC has definitely done a lot of awesome things,” Murphy said. “The whole campus center is LEED certified, there is recycling everywhere on campus and Campus Cruiser, [which is] a really incredible initiative.”
“USC is obviously the 23rd best school; we totally have … the minds, the educational opportunities, and being in L.A., the weather has extra capacity for solar energy,” she said. “It would be really incredible if the university could tap some of those resources.”
Absolutely. Ryan points out how our group has been working hard to improve that C ranking in Climate and Energy, which is way behind many other schools, like Stanford, UC Berkeley and more. 
That’s why we’re asking the administration to commission an Energy Task Force to pull together the top minds of the University, many of whom are world-renowned experts in solar power research,  building efficiency and conservation measures, and solving 21st century energy challenges. We even have our own energy institute that’s renowned for research on new energy technologies, engaging students through the Student Energy Network and more.
USC SHOULD be a top university in the nation in sustainability and specifically moving off coal to clean energy, but to do so we’ll need to take bold steps and coordinate the experts within the University and in LA to make this happen. As we meet with professors, students and staff, we’ve seen it echoed over and over how setting specific University targets to move beyond coal would send a clear signal from the administration that USC is moving to truly meet this challenge, and pull together the ideas and involvement of the broader campus community on this issue.
Such a task force should then come up with specific guidelines and an action plan to move usc from ‘middle of the pack’, as Dr. Bernstein said, to us being a major, leading institution on this. Other schools have had big successes with this. 
Our administration has definitely shown its stronger support for sustainability by supporting students’ efforts on this and more. Now they should really bring together the leadership to tackle energy and coal with a task force.
The administration has been extremely cooperative in helping to make USC a greener school, but as long as the university continues to get more energy from coal than any other fuel, it is hard to see improvement.
That’s why it is so important for the administration to adopt the energy task-force policy currently under consideration.  Until the school’s sustainability efforts can be streamlined, it will be difficult to effectively pursue any projects ambitious enough to put us in competition with our neighbors like Stanford.
Can I get a copy of the task force policy proposal? I hope is focuses on energy efficiency first and foremost.

USC faculty member Richard Reeves has published a new book highlighting the life and presidency of John F. Kennedy through pictures and stills from the Kennedy library.
In Portrait of Camelot: A Thousand Days in the Kennedy White House, Reeves, a senior lecturer at the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism, shines light on the young president.
Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan
This book was different than his previous publications, Reeves said.
“Most books are like digging trenches and digging and digging. This book was like a walk on the beach,” he said.
Portrait of Camelot was published in time to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kennedy’s election and features photos by official White House photographer, Cecil Stoughton.
Stoughton was the first official White House photographer and was able to take many candid shots of the family, Reeves said.
Unlike Reeves’ other works, this book is centered on never-before-seen photos of the Kennedy family taken when they were in the White House.
With the help of his publisher, Reeves was able to get access to the entire collection in the Kennedy library. His book includes a DVD of footage and stills that had been preserved by the library.
Rather than going into political commentary, most of this book focuses on explaining the photographs and filling the reader in on gaps the photographer was unable to cover.
“If my earlier presidential works were complicated oil paintings, this was a watercolor or a sketch,” Reeves said. “The photographs set the context and I can only explain them and hope on occasion to give some insight to them. It’s totally different from anything I’ve already done.”
Reeves, who has been part of USC’s faculty for 12 years, has written many books on politics and has published several biographies.
According to Geneva Overholser, director of the School of Journalism, Reeves’ reporting has been some of the best.
“His biographies of so many presidents — Reagan, Nixon, Kennedy — have made him one of the most important presidential biographers. His political reporting is just extraordinary,” Overholser said.
His familiarity with Kennedy came from his research between 1984 and 1993 for the biography President Kennedy: Profile of Power. The book, published in 1993, won Best Non-Fiction Book of 1993 from Time magazine and received the Book of the Year award from Washington Monthly.
According to Reeves, Kennedy was one of most influential presidents in U.S. history.
“Kennedy continues to survive in the American imagination as a cultural figure as opposed to a political figure. [After World War II], Americans were living a much more cosmopolitan life and didn’t know how to act and then came along a young couple. They really became the role models for a new America. They were role models, in effect, for modern Americans.”
Reeves had originally planned to title the book “A Young President,” to emphasize the similarities between Kennedy and President Barack Obama.
The publisher disagreed with that title, however. Portrait of Camelot is a reference to the nickname of the Kennedy presidency, Camelot, which has come to mean a period of happiness or greatness.
Matt Arnesen, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he plans to read the book.
“A lot of the stuff you see about Kennedy and other presidents are all things they want you to see,” Arnesen said. “I think something like this is definitely worth checking out.”

As the opening days of the 2010-2011 season are upon the USC basketball team (2-0, 0-0), gauging an upcoming opponent can often prove to be an arduous task.
Focused · Senior forward Alex Stepheson has played the role of the big man this season for the Trojans alongside junior forward Nikola Vucevic. USC is currently 2-0. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
From watching tape, to scouting tendencies and personnel, evaluating foes from obscure conferences on short notice — like tonight’s opponent Rider University (1-1,0-0) from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference — is difficult to say the least.
But on the heels of their impressive 2-0 start — only the second time in the past decade the team has raced out to two straight victories — the Trojans know that the biggest adjustments are made internally rather than externally.
Going into its 7:30 p.m. tussle at the Galen Center against the visiting Broncs, the team is riding high behind true freshman guard Maurice Jones’ early season play including a career-high 29 points against Santa Clara on Monday.
Looking inside, junior forward Nikola Vucevic has picked up rather nicely from his breakout season last year. The team’s lone member of the John Wooden Preseason Top 50 List has posted back-to-back double-double performances (19 points and 14 rebounds against UC Irvine and a career-high 22 points and 11 rebounds against Santa Clara).
Largely overlooked by the team’s newfound offensive firepower through their first 80 minutes is the status of 6-foot-10 senior center Alex Stepheson. The former University of North Carolina transfer received word hours before Monday’s tipoff that he had fractured his hand in USC’s home opener against UC Irvine.
Although Stepheson was able to suit up against Santa Clara, while also managing to play all 40 minutes in a cumbersome black cast, the big man appeared to be hindered offensively by the fracture most of the night, scoring only six points.
Heading into tonight’s nonconference clash, it appears the defensive-savvy center will be ready to go against Tommy Dempsey’s squad from Lawrenceville, N.J.
“We know they are a tough team, and it’s going to be a challenge,” Stepheson said.
Dempsey’s deep MAAC squad comes to town after defeating Lafayette 80-73 Saturday afternoon, thanks in large part to the experienced play off its bench, who outscored the Leopards’ bench 37-7.
Although USC’s point guard Maurice Jones has looked anything but gun shy in his first two collegiate games, Wednesday night will prove to be his first big on-court test.
The Broncs’ leader and most-experienced player is guard Justin Robinson, who comes in averaging 15 points and 5.5 assists per game.
Robinson, a native of London, is surrounded by an adequate supporting cast led by three talented freshmen — Danny Stewart, Tommy Pereira and Anthony Myles.
While second-year USC coach Kevin O’Neill has no intention of overlooking tonight’s opponent, there was no need to rummage through video and preseason scouting reports to find Wednesday’s gaping disparity: size.
On paper, Vucevic and Stepheson  look as if they will encounter little trouble on the boards during their first game of the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament.
Rider will take to the court tonight, boasting an average team height of 6-foot-4. In addition, the Broncos have only one center traveling with the team, 6-foot-10 sophomore Dera Nd-Ezuma, who through two games has logged a total of seven minutes of action.
But as the Trojans head into this early three-game tournament, the message in the locker room deviates far from underestimating their little known opponents.
“This is a great tournament, big-time,” Stepheson said. “It’s simple: We want to win it.”
Following Wednesday night’s contest, O’Neill and company will head on their first mini-road trip of the season to the site of the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.
USC will face Bradley on Friday afternoon, followed by a turnaround game against New Mexico State to conclude the tournament on Sunday.

Early in the season, it seemed as if senior tailback Allen Bradford was going to be the one to break out of the stable and establish himself as the every-down back in USC’s talent-loaded backfield.
It hasn’t worked out quite like that.
After Bradford had a big game against Minnesota, rushing 12 times for 131 yards and one touchdown, and an even bigger game two weeks later against Washington, rushing 21 times for 223 yards and two touchdowns, Bradford has almost been invisible recently.
In the five games since the personal demolition derby he exhibited against the Huskies, Bradford has totaled 26 carries for 71 yards and one touchdown. That includes the zero carries he got last week at Arizona.
Bradford mentioned earlier in the year that he was nagged by a toe injury that hindered his running ability. On Tuesday, he said he was feeling healthy, yet he still didn’t get any carries just a few days before in Tucson, Ariz.
The running back went into coach Lane Kiffin’s office to figure out the problem.
“Me being a fifth-year senior, I wanted to know the truth,” Bradford said. “Lane Kiffin always keeps it honest. Basically I’ve got to keep the ball high and tight. It’s ball security. I sat down with [running backs coach Kennedy Pola] and he showed me my last 20 carries.”
What Bradford saw in those carries was a lot of fumbles. In his last nine touches dating back to the California game, Bradford has fumbled the ball four times.
“We went back and watched [his last several carries] and he put the ball on the ground a couple times,” Kiffin said. “We went to him [in the] Arizona State game and first time we went to him he put the ball on the ground. He knows and he’s reminded that that’s more important than anything else, taking care of the ball.”
Kiffin said he and Bradford had a similar conversation earlier in the year, in the week leading up to the Minnesota game. Bradford responded with a solid performance, and now that he’s healthy, Bradford said he hopes to run more. But he knows that his fumbles were not caused by his toe injury.
“I wasn’t running like myself,” Bradford said. “I was injured but it still was no excuse for me letting the ball on the ground.”

With temperatures expected to be in the low 40s or high 30s and rainy in Corvaillis, Ore., this weekend, the Trojans are preparing to play in the cold and wet conditions they are not used to.
Several times, USC practiced with a wet ball on Tuesday simulating the conditions expected for Saturday.
“We were throwing water on the balls, you might have seen some of the ugly [throws] at first,” sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley said. “You can’t really simulate coldness. But it won’t be a problem. I think it’s a lot harder to put water on a dry ball out here because when you know it’s rainy and know it’s wet, you can adapt.”

The term “kicker” has a negative connotation for most football players.
Usually, the kicker is easily identifiable because he is punier than his teammates, looking more like somebody who should be fetching water than competing on the gridiron. Kickers have a reputation for standing around on the sidelines, working harder on their tan line than anything else, while the “real” players sweat through grueling two-a-days.

Former USC and current Dallas Cowboys kicker David Buehler is not like most kickers. Not only is he in good shape for a kicker, but his athletic prowess has put some of football’s most physically imposing position players to shame.
Buehler’s performance at the 2009 NFL Combine, where scouts put players through physical tests prior to the NFL Draft, cannot be described as anything less than legendary. At the kickers’ lifting station, Buehler shocked scouts by putting up 25 reps on the bench press at 225 pounds, besting every single cornerback prospect, offensive tackle Michael Oher (a first-round pick and the subject of the movie The Blind Side), and former USC teammate and linebacker Rey Maualuga. He also ran an impressive 4.56 40-yard dash, which was better than the times for former USC teammates and linebackers Brian Cushing and Clay Matthews.
“I prepared for [the NFL Combine] like a job interview,” Buehler said after a training camp practice with the Cowboys in Oxnard, Calif. “My body was in the best shape it ever was, and I wanted to go out and show the scouts and NFL teams what I could do.”
The Cowboys took notice, and used a fifth-round selection to get Buehler, despite already having a Pro Bowl kicker in Nick Folk.
When Buehler signed with the Cowboys, he wanted to prove to his coaches and teammates that he was more than just a kicker. In training camp, he challenged defensive back DeAngelo Smith to a 50-yard dash — and won. This gave Buehler instant credibility with his new teammates.
“Is he on steroids?” Cowboys wide receiver Roy Williams asked, laughing.
In 2009, his rookie season, the Cowboys’ coaching staff thought enough of Buehler to use him as an athlete on special teams. There Buehler excelled, making three tackles.
“I got some respect. Playing special teams last year gave me an opportunity to show my teammates what I can do,” Buehler said. “I challenged DeAngelo to that race last year and beat him, so they know that I am competitive and a fiery guy, so I hope they have a little bit of respect from doing all that stuff.”
With Folk still in the fold, the Cowboys primarily had Buehler handle kickoffs last season. His booming leg was an asset for the team. He led the NFL with 29 touchbacks, which forces the opposing team to start the possession on the 20-yard line.
This season, Buehler earned the field goal kicker position. He has made 11 of 15 field goal attempts, with a long of 51 yards, and 21 of 22 extra-point attempts.
“My confidence is higher than it has ever been,” Buehler said. “I feel like I transitioned night and day from where I was last year.”
Off the field, Buehler is a quirky guy. He refuses to step on blue handicap paint, and when he cooks food in the microwave, he always sets the timer with seven as the last digit.
“He is a good teammate,” Cowboys running back Felix Jones said. “He can surprise us sometimes. He is a really funny guy to be around.”
Buehler almost always has a mischievous grin on his face, a trait that he shares with the late Trojan kicker Mario Danelo, who died in 2007 after falling off a San Pedro cliff.
“I am living the dream. Mario Danelo once said it, ‘Living the dream.’ That is how I truly feel,” Buehler said. “He meant a lot to me. He was a good mentor to me, and he taught me a lot about the mental aspect of kicking, and a lot of other things. He was always happy, and always had a smile on his face. He was never down.”
While at USC, Buehler started ahead of Joe Houston, the Trojans’ kicker this season.
“Joe is a great kicker,” Buehler said. “I have learned a lot from Joe, and we learned a lot from each other … He is one of my good friends, and I enjoy watching him on Saturdays.”
As the starting placekicker for the Cowboys, Buehler has focused more on making long field goals than big tackles, but his aggressive mindset is still there.
“I have to keep myself poised and calm during games, and I cannot get too fired up,” Buehler said. “I have adopted that kicker’s mentality, but if somebody gets loose, I will be sure to light them up.”
This would have been a good article a year ago. Sadly, Buehler has been borderline horrible this year as a kicker. Sure, he can run and isn’t your typical puny kicker. But when it comes down to putting the ball between the uprights, he hasn’t been very good. His kickoffs aren’t going deep into the endzone as often as they were last year either.
Don’t see you out there, do we,  Ryan?  Enough said.

As a child, he watched his father run up and down the court, unaware of the sights and sounds that passed him by.
When he grew old enough to appreciate the significance of sports, it was soccer — not basketball — that first caught his eye.
But for USC’s junior power forward Nikola Vucevic, whether in the serenity of a soccer field in Belgium or under the bright lights of the Galen Center, adaptation has always been there to throw the Swiss-native a well-timed assist.
Basketball has always been in the bloodlines of the Vucevic family.
The 20-year old’s mother, Ljiljana, was an interior staple for the Sarajevo club team Zeljeznicar in the 1970s, while also staring for the Yugoslavian national team.
His father, Borislav, personified the word “longevity” with a career that spanned three decades and lasted into his mid-40s. He too was well-known for being a proud member of Yugoslavia’s national team.
One would have thought these glaring examples of hoops-dominated genetics would be enough to seal the deal for an impressionable child whose early years were defined by the uncertainty that often hangs over a professional athlete’s family.
But as his dad starred as the small forward for the up-and-coming Okapi Maes Aalst of Belgium’s premier basketball division, it was the grass-stained glory and a very different kind of dribble that pulled at the heart strings of the defiant child.
Soccer is a predominant aspect of Belgian culture, second only to the nation’s lightly crisped waffles. And so, where rudimentary skills of left-handed layups and chest passes would have seemed appropriate, Vucevic’s attention was fixated on the public pitches in Aalst or neighboring Brussels.
Yet, as the sport kept growing in fanaticism, so did Vucevic in height.
“I just got too tall and really was better at basketball,” Vucevic said.
It was an appreciation, however, that was not inherited but learned.
From tricks his father taught him after the family moved back to Montenegro, to the insightful lessons he received from his mother, to the nuances he picked up from watching Michael Jordan or Serbian star Dejan Bodiroga, basketball went from a budding passion to a clear-cut aspiration for the future.
Although his teenage years were adorned by newspaper clippings and refrigerator-bound individual rankings, the once basketball-oblivious child turned 6-foot-10 boy wonder knew back in 2007 that dreams of the collegiate and professional levels could only be achieved with another international adaptation.
For Montenegro’s 2007 Best Young Player, life had been measured as much by on-court achievement as by the miles logged during his 17-year trek — to the tune of 1,100 miles between his birthplace in Switzerland, childhood home in Belgium and teenage years in Montenegro.
But another language barrier, schooling system, lifestyle change and strenuous acclimation process were not enough to deter the soft-spoken Vucevic from clinging to his transcontinental goals.
In October 2007, he enrolled in Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, Calif. Within seven months, former USC coach Tim Floyd had seen enough and offered him a roster spot on the USC basketball team. Soon after his letter of intent was signed in June, Vucevic had become fluent in the English language in a blink of an eye.
Yet, what appeared on paper to be a seamless transition turned out to be the first of many hard-fought adjustments in the Serbian’s new American life.
“People live differently here than they live in Europe. Everything is quick here, especially in L.A.,” Vucevic said. “The biggest adjustment I had here was to learn how to do things quick — get a schedule, go to school, then practice, then tutoring. It was a little tough adjusting to a quick life.”
Although the hustle of cosmopolitan life initially caught the diffident big man off guard, eligibility issues, crowd sizes and incoming big man recruits made his first year at USC less than ideal.
His name no longer created a stir, his exploits on the U18 team in Montenegro largely were an afterthought and his presence on the court was often criticized, not celebrated.
But Vucevic stayed the course.
He got stronger in the weight room, adjusted to the physicality and up-tempo nature of basketball in the United States and became a student of back-to-the-basket moves and rebounding tendencies.
“I knew I had to make a major step in my game,” Vucevic said. “I worked harder in the summer, got more mature and when I got on the court I knew what I could do well and what I couldn’t.”
Before last season, USC’s nationally recognized revolving door saw the exit of forward Taj Gibson to the NBA, Floyd to the temporary unemployment line and Williams to more peaceful pastures in Tucson, Ariz. And in a small, unnoticed twist of fate, the role of interior offensive presence was not left for the defensive-minded senior forward Alex Stepheson, but in the raw, unproven hands of Vucevic.
First-year USC coach Kevin O’Neill recognized the talent and bevy of potential he had in his new starting power forward.
On the surface, Vucevic’s 2009-2010 campaign was a coming out party. He finished the sanctions-marred season second on the team in scoring (10.7 points per game) and first in the Pac-10 in rebounding (9.4 per game). He was awarded the conference’s Most Improved Player Player Award in March and captured the same honors at USC’s banquet weeks later.
But a glance deeper at the first-year starter’s numbers and it is evident that adapting to the rigors of a 30-game season was a fight that Vucevic struggled to survive.
There were double-double nights and moments where future potential became a showcase in the present, but Vucevic limped into the off-season with four straight games of single-digit scoring outputs and nearly half a season of performances in which he recorded three field goals or fewer.
Last summer, however, there was no time to stare at the new hardware adorning his Los Angeles apartment. Seniors said their goodbyes, inexperienced freshmen said their hellos and a new role was thrust upon the now blossoming forward: the go-to guy.
The subtle mental and physical changes that came with the promotion signaled another opportunity for Vucevic to show how far he’d come.
“I have been here one of the longest on this team, and I definitely need to be a leader,” Vucevic said. “I just want to try and talk to my teammates on the floor, tell them how to improve if they are doing something wrong. When I was a freshman, all of the guys were quick to help me. Now I get that opportunity to do the same.”
And if Saturday’s season opener against UC Irvine was any indication, the new and improved forward provided a telling sample of his perseverance.
Held to a mere two points on 1-of-3 shooting in the first half, USC’s big man did what he knew best: He adapted.
A few baseline spins and a put-back jam later, and the proud member of this year’s John R. Wooden Preseason Top 50 List finished the 62-49 victory leading all players in points and rebounds, with 19 and 14 respectively.
Monday night, he continued to impress against Santa Clara, posting a career-high 22 points accompanied by a surprising zero fouls committed.
As the line between his collegiate and professional careers grows ever closer, each step forward lets Vucevic know that for once it’s OK to stop and smell the roses.
For now, adaptation it seems has lent itself to some much-needed stability.

“Why do you want to be a filmmaker? Is it to tell great stories? Is it to move people? That’s kind of the question.”
Luke Greenfield said to  an audience of aspiring movie directors, producers and writers on Tuesday night in the George Lucas Building at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
Photo by Roland Wiryawan | Daily Trojan
Greenfield, who is best known for his work as the director of films such as The Animal and The Girl Next Door, came to USC to offer advice to students trying to navigate the behemoth that is the film industry. Screenwriter Nicholas Thomas, with whom Greenfield co-wrote The Last Bachelor, moderated the discussion.
Greenfield explained how he got his start in the movie industry. He began his career as a filmmaker when most other kids were busy playing in the park at age 10 after an uncle gave him his first video camera and he quickly began experimenting with the art of film.
Having decided early on that he would do everything possible to become a successful filmmaker, Greenfield set his sights on USC’s School of Cinematic Arts. After being accepted, he brought his talents as a young filmmaker from Connecticut to Los Angeles.
“I was an undergraduate here from 1990 to 1994 and we used to go to see all the people that would come in and talk,” Greenfield said. “I always wanted someone who could tell us honestly what it was like going through this actual program and getting out and making movies.”
Greenfield tried to do just that as he discussed his experiences at USC and how it was a valuable step toward his ultimate goal of becoming a Hollywood director. He spoke specifically of a film class where he was given the chance to direct his own short film, Alive & Kicking.
Greenfield’s next effort was a movie he co-wrote and directed called The Right Hook, a comedy about a loser trying to woo the girl of his dreams, which he screened for the audience during Tuesday’s discussion.
Students were given a chance to ask questions throughout the discussion and no one balked at the chance to ask Greenfield for advice on becoming a successful filmmaker.
One student asked about Greenfield’s time at USC and what he learned.
“Technically I didn’t learn much,” he said. “I think what was more valuable here was the people I had met and the people that were in my class, above me or below me in age.”
After his work on The Girl Next Door, Greenfield found himself with numerous offers to direct other movies but instead chose to develop a project of his own. What audiences today recognize as Role Models began as a project written by Greenfield called Big Brothers.
The director quickly illustrated how tough it can be to be a creator in Hollywood, as the studio that bought his script had a completely different idea in mind and transformed his idea into something very different.
“This movie Role Models had come out … it was a much different film than what I was trying to make. I was trying to do About a Boy, more grounded and more real and I was stuck,” Greenfield said.
Despite setbacks in his career, it was obvious that Greenfield’s foundation as a filmmaker was built on USC’s campus — where, he said, cinema students are exposed to top-notch equipment.
“Looking around this school though, the facilities you have here are pretty insane. I’m mixing a movie right now and [USC’s] mixing stages are just as good as Warner Bros.,” he said.
Although Greenfield was the focus of the event, he wasn’t the only one to speak. Thomas also offered his opinions on filmmaking, adding to Greenfield’s comments and sharing common experiences.
“I would say of the last 50 meetings we have been on, in 35 of them USC has come up some how some way,” Thomas said. “That’s the common bond.”
Ultimately, Greenfield offered advice that most people will only learn by struggling through the film industry and provided a rare glimpse into the life of a filmmaker who has stumbled, fallen and picked himself right back up again.
Before leaving the stage, Greenfield called on audience members to examine their dreams and formulate a plan on how to get there.
“You have to think about what road you want to take, why are you here?” he asked. “Why did you come to film school?”

Chapter 14 could only exist as the end result of the disbandment of the metal-core band Destroy the Runner.
Allusionary · Chapter 14’s debut release, Like Trees In November, takes thematic and design influence from the book Watership Down. - Photos courtesy of The Muse Box 
Vocalist Chad Ackerman and guitarist/bassist/drummer Tanner Sparks — former members of a number of popular bands such as As I Lay Dying, Die Trying  and Austrian Death Machine — originally started the band as a side project but failed to find backing. When Destroy the Runner offered them spots to replace departing members, Chapter 14 went on hiatus.
Now, Ackerman and Sparks are focusing on Chapter 14 full time.
Their new EP, Like Trees In November, presents a full-fledged peek into new emotional American rock ‘n’ roll. The sound is derived from a number of different influences that span the genre: everything from Metallica to Queen can be heard in the same songs.
The tropes of this genre’s trademark sound seem to be a fusion of metallic drums and base sound with extremely gentle and personal lyrics and melodies. The pairing of high energy with these soft emotions brings to mind an almost Christian rock-like sense of grief and absolution.
Ackerman’s vocals are high-reaching and well-executed. He lifts off with every line, creating songs that are easily distinguishable thanks to his, one-of-a-kind voice.
The band’s esoteric names, both for itself and the album, come from Ackerman’s favorite book, Watership Down by English author Richard Adams. The novel follows a group of rabbits that face death and destruction while looking for a safe home.
Chapter 14 of the novel, titled “Like Trees In November,” depicts rabbits trying to persuade their friends to leave the farm they live on in order to flee from a farmer bent on destroying them. Unable to convince them, the rabbits are forced to flee knowing that they’ve left their fellow rabbits to certain doom.
These themes creep into the sound and lyrics of the album. Ackerman often sings of frustrating love and the strength of hope in the face of impending disaster. Unsettling, screamed vocals are often interspersed with soft melodies, giving listeners the idea of a great pressure between one’s inner and outer self in the album’s story.
A lot of emo-rock — like many artistic movements — focuses on alienation and a sense of separation from the rest of the world. There’s a sense of damaged love, unrequited yearning and isolation, coalesced into an entire image of a past.
Albums like this one always seem to present an aesthetic of reflection, as if everything that could happen in the world has. These records live and die by the vocalist’s ability to convey the themes. Ackerman’s powerful vocals not only get the message across but put them right in the listener’s face.
Even though it is only releasing its first record, Chapter 14 has already done two full U.S. tours in the past. Ackerman said that the band had a following but never had the chance to record until now.
This allowed the band members to get a sense of what works, letting them revise their approach and oeuvre before actually putting together an album. Instead of a rushed, undeveloped sound, Chapter 14 was able to include some of its newer influences into the album for this reason.
Bands that have an opportunity to hone new music on tour or in small shows always seem to produce a better product. The Doors used to do that, playing future albums every night in Hollywood clubs until the band had tweaked its sound enough to near-perfection.
Like Trees In November has that polished feel of well-thought-out movement and motions through the languid texture of the songs. None of it seems ad hoc or haphazard.
A lot of the album features recognizable guitar and drum progressions. There’s that somewhat distorted power chord pick-up sound, where you can imagine Ackerman lifting his fingers lightly on his guitar strings to make it fuzzy.
What’s most attractive about the album is Ackerman and Sparks’ enthusiasm. Knowing their excitement for the new project makes it twice as enjoyable for fans because they know they are hearing pure soul. Chapter 14 is a band that will find a niche in the emo-rock audience, especially appealing to those who love that arched and troubled sound reminiscent of Ackerman and Sparks’ previous projects and influences.

Our tour started on the corner of First Street and Central Avenue in Little Tokyo, the very spot where in January 1942 Japanese-Americans were told to report for transportation to internment camps during World War II.
Urban jungle · The Architecture and Design Museum’s Urban Hike program took Angelenos through Little Tokyo, highlighting parts of the area that casual visitors would not notice without a closer look. - Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan 
Because of the corner’s symbolic significance, the Japanese American Museum was erected here along with the original Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist temple. And as the first place in Los Angeles to receive public art funding from the city,  there is also a bronze replica of a photographer’s tripod camera that was assembled inside an internment camp from boxes and a smuggled-in mirror.
It is exactly these histories buried within the structural landscape of some of Los Angeles’ most overlooked areas that the Architecture and Design Museum’s Urban Hike program aims to expose.
Started in 2001 by a group of architects, the A+D Museum has remained itinerant for years, living in donated spaces in Downtown and the Sunset Strip before finally settling into a permanent space in the Miracle Mile earlier this year.
The tour series — dubbed “Forgotten Los Angeles” — has provided curiosity-seekers with enriching exposés of neighborhoods such as Leimert Park, Boyle Heights and Eagle Rock for the last three summers.
In 2010, however, the program expanded to include both a spring and fall/winter series, turning the seasonal hikes into a year-round opportunity for Angelenos to learn about the many unique pockets of their city.
Last weekend’s Little Tokyo tour was one of the more interesting of the bunch, however, since — unlike other Urban Hike locations such as MacArthur Park or Koreatown — the culturally themed neighborhood on the northeast side of Downtown is relatively well-known.
Many who grew up in Los Angeles (and thus, many on the tour) had been to Little Tokyo before, but none had taken the time to explore its architectural and artistic nuances.
That’s where Mike the Poet comes in.
Mike Sonksen, aka Mike the Poet, is the guide for all of the Urban Hikes. A third-generation L.A. native, Sonksen is a teacher and L.A.-centric slam poet who frequently hosts localized tours for groups throughout the city.
His knowledge of Los Angeles’ history and multi-faceted culture brings personal perspectives to what could easily be cookie-cutter tours, a quality most useful in a familiar, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood such as Little Tokyo.
Sonksen walked the group from our original internment camp-pick-up gathering spot down to the Go For Broke World War II Monument at the end of the promenade, explaining along the way how the jazz scene on South Central Avenue moved north during the war, turning the deserted Little Tokyo into what was then called Bronzeville.
Once at the monument, he read a poem from one of his students called “We Are the Brave,” which provided a modern voice to the Japanese-American plight during World War II.
We are The Brave, the poem says, For courageously enduring the harsh acts / that the U.S. government bestowed upon us.
Being reminded of the lowest point in this important minority group’s history in Los Angeles was a somber way to begin a tour of Little Tokyo, but it was crucial to understanding the context of the artistic and cultural prosperity that has subsequently flourished in this still-evolving neighborhood.
The mood lightened as we began the main part of the tour. In addition to pointing out popular restaurants along the route — “They’re all good because if they weren’t, they wouldn’t last” — Sonksen introduced public art pieces and riffed on the histories of some of the area’s more interesting structures.
The Noguchi Plaza, for instance, houses not only the entrance to the Japanese Cultural Center but also an art piece (called “To The Issei”) by the plaza’s namesake and designer Isamu Noguchi. A native Angeleno of Irish-Japanese descent, Noguchi is an internationally renown artist, but the plaza remains his only installation in his hometown.
Another point of interest for Sonksen was the building on the corner of Central and Second Street, which he and his friends call “the Batman Building.” Built in 1931 by famous L.A. architect A.C. Martin (the building’s stern facade does have a Gotham City feel to it), it used to house the Brunkswick drug factory, but the remainder of its history has eluded Sonksen’s research and little else is known.
Though the building’s past remains enigmatic, its current tenants on the ground-floor retail spaces tell of the neighborhood’s future. The former home of American Apparel’s flagship Little Tokyo store (which is now located across the street), the Batman Building houses a specialty sneaker store, a jazz club and — as of a few months ago — an art gallery dedicated to promoting street artists such as Shepard Fairey and MER 1.
Although traditional Japanese culture will forever be a part of Little Tokyo’s visual fabric, the historical district is transitioning into a unique urban space with chain stores such as Starbucks and Pinkberry, new luxury loft complexes dotting the formerly low-slung landscape and a young, hip demographic quickly moving in.
In this, Little Tokyo is a neighborhood in transition. Once the literal home of many of Los Angeles’ Japanese-American citizens, it now serves as a symbolic cultural center for commemoration and celebration. Its freshest buildings are expanding the neighborhood’s boundaries, linking it with the adjacent artist district and Downtown’s historic core.
Through the Architecture and Design Museum’s Urban Hike of Little Tokyo, the area’s past, present and future were illuminated and the current evolution of the district into a more multi-cultural urban environment is being mirrored in neighborhoods across the city.
As Sonksen said in his final poem of the tour — an ode to Los Angeles he wrote called “Living the Dream” — “It’s hard to believe open space used to define this place … check this new age renaissance.”

Headline gives comic relief
I am a senior at USC, and I have a lot of respect for the Daily Trojan.
I can only imagine the amount of work that goes into publishing a professional-looking newspaper every single day, especially while keeping up with school.
However, on Nov. 9, the Daily Trojan surpassed itself. It was without a doubt, my favorite DT moment of the last four years.
Just below the fold on the front cover was an article with a headline worthy of The Onion: “Soda high in sugar, study finds.” A simple enough statement, but one that had me and all of my roommates in stitches.
Was this a practical joke? Could there ever have been doubt in anyone’s mind that soda was high in sugar?
Upon further inspection of the article, I was slightly disappointed.
It was a perfectly respectable story about false advertising, how soda contains higher levels of some sugars than previously thought and the dangers of consuming beverages with such high fructose.
All the same, the headline stands alone as one of the funniest things I have ever read in your newspaper. Thank you for a good laugh!
Sincerely,

Walks derail commute
To whom it may concern,
In all of my years at USC, I have always had a burning question that has left me feeling unsatisfied:
Why is it that every single one of these charity walks has to close off the entire campus? I am a commuter and I pay full tuition to go to this school.
I contribute to student organizations on campus, one of the things that I feel make this school great.
These road closures deny me the chance to contribute because many events are held on weekends, and I cannot get to campus when the roads are closed.
I’m not saying to move these walks entirely.  I’m not saying I think the causes are worthless.  I just want one street to stay open so I can get to the school.

Former Labor Secretary and current UC Berkeley professor Robert Reich is, by any measure, very liberal.
His new book, Aftershock: The Next Economy and America’s Future, is no exception, and as such, its teachings must be taken with a grain of salt.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
That said, Reich’s argument is compelling because he makes the case that his proposals would work in everyone’s favor — including the upper class — making it an important line of reasoning for the many would-be tycoons on campus to understand.
His basic point is that our current financial crisis, rather than being an isolated incident, was only the latest manifestation of a structural problem that has plagued the American economy since 1980: rising inequality and shrinking middle-class wages.
American economic growth from the end of World War II until 1980 was broad-based; during that time, poverty fell, the middle class grew, and the top 1 percent of earners’ share of national income is the lowest it’s ever been. Since then, the opposite has occurred — during the decade preceding the financial crisis, middle-class wages actually shrunk despite massive growth in gross domestic product, the stock market and other economic indicators.
As a result, we now find ourselves facing a higher level of inequality than at any time since the eve of the Great Depression in 1928. According to Reich, it is this inequality that is the source of major economic crises, and we are bound to experience a recession even worse if it is not addressed.
This happens in a number of ways. Most basically, Reich argues that there is a point below which the middle class can no longer afford to buy the things — houses, cars, iPods — that make the economy go and the upper class rich. The continued success of the wealthy, therefore, depends largely on sustained demand from the rest of the country. In other words, to keep getting richer, the wealthy will have to accept a smaller piece of a larger pie.
Reich also makes an interesting point about the connection between this issue and the latest economic crisis.
As many USC students can probably attest, and as psychological studies have confirmed, being surrounded by extravagant spending leads people to spend more themselves  — even if their incomes have not increased.
This has been true of the United States’ middle class during the past thirty years. Despite stagnant incomes, the middle class greatly increased its spending during that time to mimic the upper classes’ conspicuous consumption.
The existence of two-year payment plans for such unnecessary items as flat-screen televisions and surround-sound systems are a clear indicator of this.
Americans found a number of ways to finance this consumption. The first was to increase the prevalence of two-income households and work longer hours. When they couldn’t work anymore, they borrowed — usually against the value of their house, which was perceived to be permanently increasing.
This created a credit bubble. When it burst, we entered the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
As President Barack Obama so frequently reminded voters on the campaign trail, the worst of the crisis is over. The economy is growing again, and unemployment is, at the very least, not increasing anymore.
However, Reich argues that the relative quickness of the recovery has taken away from the incentive to make structural reforms that would make the economy far stronger.
The anemic, “jobless” recovery of which we are now in the midst of is weak because persistent inequality prevents us from having a dynamic yet stable domestic market. Now that the worst is behind us, Reich fears that policy makers will no longer feel the need to make changes that will prevent another, even more severe crisis.
How to achieve these changes — and the extent of government’s role in the process — is certainly up for debate. Reich advocates making the tax system more progressive by increasing rates on high incomes and capital gains.
Certainly, the fact that those rates are lower than virtually any time since the Great Depression supports this point of view; letting the Bush tax cuts expire would be a good first step.
Even if one does not agree with its policy prescriptions, however, Aftershock is still valuable for the basic problem that it points out.
The United States is more unequal than it has been since the Gilded Age of the 1920s; aside from the moral implications, this represents a structural obstacle to sustained economic growth.
It is therefore in everyone’s interest — including the rich — to see that this problem is resolved before it leads to another crisis.
Daniel Charnoff is a senior majoring in international relations (global business). His column, “Through the Static,” runs Wednesdays.
Diane has it absolutely right.  As an alumni of USC from quite a while ago, I can attest to one thing.  It’s hard work that makes one successful.  I have a 10 year old son, and we make sure he does his homework and gets to bed on time.  I contrast that to a 10 year old inner city child whom I mentor.  His welfare receiving single mom doesn’t make him read books, lets him watch TV, and let’s him stay up late (11:00 on a school night), and clearly does not instill the value of education.  Fast forward 15 years, and I can guarantee that my son will have graduated from college, and this poor boy, who is bright, and sweet, will probably be on welfare too.
The only inequality that exists in America is the horrible public schools that are leaving a portion of our population without the means to a good future.  If you think that public schools are the only solution, then I would disagree.  It’s parents who are the key to education.  Parents who care enough to ensure that kids in public schools are educated , parents who home school, and parents who send their kids to private schools.  If parents think they can drop their kids at the bus stop and that ends their obligation for the education, then things will never get better.
Nice comment Diane. One of the funniest lines in the article was “In other words, to keep getting richer, the wealthy will have to accept a smaller piece of a larger pie.”  What in the world does that even mean? As if “the wealthy” sit at a table together and decide how much of the pie is theirs.  People earn as much money as possible, corporations earn as much as they can, and policies, not “the wealthy” dictate where wealth will be achieved.  And while everything he says is true about inequality and the rising gap between the wealthy and the middle class, this is only a symptom, not the cause.  This rising inequality is the result of many things, one of which is tax policy, but more importantly monetary and fiscal policy, as well as the role of Wall Street.  These are topics that the author Daniel seems to have no clue or knowledge about, and childishly laments the growing inequality instead.  People must understand that this is only a symptom, not a cause.
The jobless recovery that Daniel alludes to has nothing at all to do with the idea that “persistent inequality prevents us from having a dynamic yet stable domestic market.”  This fluffy statement, when you think about it, has no meaning at all.  The recovery has been jobless because the government has artificially pumped billions of dollars into the economy, and Wall Street has been bailed out and put back on its feet.  This results in a “recovery” on Wall Street and investments, but not in jobs because nothing really has been done to affect the job market.
Let us discuss the real causes of this crisis before trying to fix the inequality that persists, which is only indicative of a larger problem. Perhaps Daniel should read another book or two before his next article.
Oops forgot to add — if Daniel likes reading about economics, I recommend he try anything by Milton Friedman. Open your mind, Daniel — that’s what college is supposed to be all about.
There are so many misstatements in this piece one doesn’t know where to begin. But let me just say this. This perceived “inequality” is a red herring, a straw man. We don’t need “equality” of the totalitarian kind espoused by little man Reich. We need equality of opportunity, which is best assured by government getting out of business’ way and letting the market grow and provide jobs. Then the people who wish to excel can do so. Those who are under the mistaken impression that the world owes them a living will continue to be “unequal” as they do not have the character to pull themselves up. No amount of elitist progressive tax hikes will change that, although they will continue to destroy the business climate in this state and this country, leading to fewer jobs and less opportunity for people to “be more equal.” Great idea, Daniel. Sheesh.
There most pressing moral problems with “inequality” are the immoral ways the Left insists on responding to it — by forcing those who produce a lot to subsidize those who sit on their a$$es. What’s more, handouts are harmful to both individual character and the character of a community. I submit exhibit A, B, C, and D: South Central, Harlem, inner city Chicago, inner city Detroit… I could add exhibits E through Z and it would be the same thing. Every place where Leftist philosophy of high taxes and high welfare has been allowed to reign is a freakin’ cesspool. It is injurious to people’s human dignity to treat them like children, it destroys families, and — most ironic of all — it perpetuates poverty and a permanent underclass. Great idea, Leftists! Sheesh.

After reviewing video footage of the team’s 24-21 loss to USC last Saturday, Arizona Wildcats officials changed Arizona kicker Alex Zendejas’ missed field goal to a blocked kick.
The reviewed 34-yard field goal attempt came in the first quarter and was Arizona’s first and only chance in the game to take the lead against the Trojans.
According to officials, the kick was deflected by USC redshirt junior Michael Reardon at the line of scrimmage, and though the ball still managed to reach the uprights, officials say the tip changed the course of the kick.
NCAA rules define a blocked kick as “touching the ball by an opponent of the kicking team in an attempt to prevent the ball from advancing beyond the neutral zone.”
After the missed Arizona field goal, USC managed to build a 14-0 first quarter lead and didn’t let go for the rest of the game.  The the Wildcats managed to cut the margin down to just three points with a minute to go in the game, their special teams failed to recover the ensuing onside kick.
The No. 23 Wildcats are off with a bye this week, but will finish the season with two huge games against top-ranked Oregon on Nov. 26 and state rival Arizona State on Dec. 2.
No. 20 USC will head to Corvallis, Oregon this Saturday to take on the Oregon State Beavers and will wrap up this year’s home schedule with a Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh against longtime rival Notre Dame.

Democrats took a terrible blow in the midterm elections two weeks ago, and now they’ve been dealt another. Sarah Palin’s new reality series Sarah Palin’s Alaska premiered on TLC Sunday night to record-breaking numbers. With almost 5 million viewers, it is the network’s highest rated series premiere ever.
In the show, Palin serves as a perky tour guide of beautiful Alaskan landscapes while also giving us a glimpse into her hometown “regular American life.” A commercial for the show tips us off to all the ways Palin will be ingratiating herself to viewers – and potential voters – along the way.
In an obviously staged scene, Palin charmingly reminds her sixteen-year-old daughter Willow, “No boys allowed upstairs.” She’s just a regular American mom dealing with a teenage daughter (and she has apparently learned a lot since Bristol). And there might be some winning self-deprecation as well — Palin smilingly tells us that on a clear day, “you can see Russia from here.”
Variety’s Brian Lowry calls the series “an eight-hour infomercial for the former Alaska governor.”  If it is the extended 2012 campaign ad that many people think it is, the Democrats are going to have to up their game. Between Sarah Palin’s Alaska and Bristol Palin advancing to the semifinals on the top-rated Dancing with the Stars, the Palins are really building that constituency.
Best-case scenario for Dems: Palin wins the GOP primary all but guaranteeing Obama another 4 years. There is no way she would even come close to winning the general and everyone knows it. GOP needs to recruit a better candidate to run so hopefully they’ll convince Romney to give it another shot.
Worst-case scenario: Palin gets elected, sparking a mass influx of moderate- to left- Americans into Canada, Mexico and Europe. 
I bet you ten bucks.

On Monday, an NFL arbitrator denied Kiffin’s grievance as well as the countergrievances filed by the Oakland Raiders for lawyer and arbitration fees following Kiffin’s termination as coach.
Before USC coach Lane Kiffin elected to leave the University of Tennessee for his dream job at the University of Southern California, Kiffin was the head coach of an Oakland Raiders team that was residing at the bottom of the AFC West.
After a 5-15 overall record, owner Al Davis fired Kiffin in the second year of his 3-year, $6-million contract “for cause.”  Davis alleged that Kiffin had lied to him and acted insubordinately during his short tenure.
Immediately after his termination, Kiffin filed a grievance through the NFL Coaches’ Association for the remaining $2.6 million left on his contract before reducing that figure to $333,000 after accounting for an offset from his salary as the coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.
Raiders executive John Herrerra stated that Kiffin exemplified a “stunning lack of concern” for the rules set forth by his contract and that Monday’s decision by the NFL was an overwhelming victory for the Raiders.

The Boss is back and he’s better than ever.
A new boxed set called The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story was released today and it revisits the work of Bruce Springsteen during the time of the recording of the original album.
Included in the boxed set is three DVDs, a remastered version of the original album (Darkness on the Edge of Town) and an album of previously unreleased material. The DVDs include two live sets and a documentary about the making of the album.
Darkness on the Edge of Town was originally released in 1978 and proved to be a new level for Bruce Springsteen. Although Springsteen fans will be more than satisfied with all the new material in the is boxed set, what is probably most exciting is that a bound copy of some of Bruce’s original notebooks will also be included.
This boxed set is sure to offer a closer look into the life of one of the United State’s most influential musicians.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to ban plastic grocery bags in some parts of Los Angeles County, including Altedena, Valencia and Rowland Heights, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The bag ban does not extend to the 88 cities in L.A. county, however.
The ban passed 3-1, with support from Supervisors Gloria Molina, Mark Ridley-Thomas, and Zev Yaroslavsky.
“Plastic bags are a pollutant. They pollute the urban landscape. They are what we call in our county urban tumbleweed,” Yaroslavsky said.
The ban will prohibit grocery stores from using plastic bags to carry out groceries. The exceptions are bags for fruit, vegetables and meat.
Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich said smaller companies would not be able to afford paper bags, the alternative to plastic bags.
“At a time of economic uncertainty, with a large number of businesses leaving our state and community this would not be an appropriate time … to impose this additional regulation,” Antonovich said.

For the second game in a row, the USC women’s basketball team fell behind early.  Only this time, the Women of Troy (1-1) could not overcome a slow start.
Big shooter · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath, pictured here last season, contributed 12 points, four rebounds and four steals on Monday. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
No. 5 Duke (2-0) jumped out to an 18-point halftime lead and coasted to a 75-50 victory at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, N.C., handing the Women of Troy their first loss of the season.
“The difference in the two games is we weren’t having fun [Monday],” junior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “We were pressing because we were down so many points and got out of our style of basketball.”
Poor rebounding once again hurt the Women of Troy against Duke. The Blue Devils pounded USC on the glass all night, outrebounding the Women of Troy 50-37 and grabbing 21 offensive rebounds.
“When you give up 26 second-chance points you aren’t going to win many games,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “It doesn’t matter what you do prior to a team shooting the ball. When the ball is in the air that determines what’s going to happen.”
Cooper and his players said the best remedy for their rebounding woes is more effort.
“We didn’t do a bad job against Gonzaga, so we thought we’d be fine doing the exact same thing [against Duke],” Gilbreath said. “Going back to the drawing board and working on the little things like boxing out will help us.”
Foul trouble also plagued USC for most of the game. All five starters committed at least three fouls, and sophomore forward Christina Marinacci fouled out late in the second half. Duke turned those fouls into 19 points from the free-throw line.
USC made several runs during the second half but couldn’t get the margin below 14 points. Gilbreath led USC with 12 points and four steals. Junior guard Ashley Corral added 10 points but shot just 3-of-10 from the floor.
“We have [Ashley] in a difficult situation because she should just be shooting the ball for us,” Cooper said. “But we are asking her to be a playmaker and a leader. But she’ll get better, it just takes practice.”
Corral was not the only player who struggled with shooting. USC held Duke to 42 percent from the field, but the Women of Troy made only 17 of their 54 attempts.
Senior guard Jasmine Thomas led Duke with a game-high 14 points. The Duke reserves also outscored USC’s bench, 34-13.
“This would have been a monumental win for us,” Cooper said. “But again we’ve got to go back to the drawing board. I think we did some good things, just to be 1-1. It’s a long season and we can make this ground up in the next two games. We have to use this as a learning experience.”
Aggressive nonconference scheduling has been the norm for USC since Cooper arrived on campus, and the next month does not get any easier, with upcoming games against No. 6 Xavier and No. 19 Georgia. Still, the team is confident it can rebound from the Duke game.
“[Tonight] was a learning experience for us,” Gilbreath said. “It’s better to lose like this early in the year when we have time to go back and fix our mistakes.”
Same old story can’t really compete with the elite programs around the country. Strictly pathetic to lose by 25 even on the road against a top ten team. Coach Cooper is supposed to be a defensive minded coach which has not shown in the first two games giving up 73 and 75 pts. Real top assts. with his son and former JC mentor you have to wonder where the program is headed. No discipline on defense from year to year no matter who the coach is lately.

Senior fullback and captain Stanley Havili has been touted as the most complete player on the Trojan roster — and for good reason. He can block, run, and receive as well as anyone else on the football field on any given night.
The right direction · Senior fullback Stanley Havili decided how he’d spend his college years shortly after his freshman year by staying at USC. -  Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
This doesn’t come as a surprise either. Havili’s 84 career receptions are the most ever by a USC fullback and rank 25th all time on the Trojans’ career pass catching list. He is ranked as the No. 1 fullback in the class of 2011 and has soaring NFL draft prospects.
And if his 500-plus yards of total offense this season aren’t enough, Havili has served as the vocal and emotional leader of a squad shocked with the transition into a new coaching regime.
All of this is general knowledge, at least to USC fans. What might not be so well known, however, is the fact that all of the success and hype that Havili has garnered as a Trojan in the past few years might never have come true had the senior taken the other path in a crossroads he encountered.
Havili is a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a highly organized religion that follows a lifelong program of participation and growth. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the fourth-largest religious institution in the United States, with more than six million members in the United States and more than 14 million worldwide.
At the age of 19, many male members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints take a rite of passage.
Missionaries, also known as brothers or elders, take a two-year hiatus from their working lives or studies in order to fully devote themselves to their traveling gospel. Young men aged 19-25 must meet standards of worthiness after undergoing a lengthy application process.
Then, the Quorom of Twelve Apostles, the second-highest governing body of the Church, assigns the elder to a mission in a location other than of his home. After being trained, the elders are sent to spread the gospel in a very disciplined lifestyle, their only outside contact being written letters to their parents and a call to their mothers twice a year. The trip is held in high reverence and the image of elders cruising through towns is a trademark of the Church.
For Havili, his football career had usually taken precedence over all else, including his religious plans. The senior had the opportunity to bring together his faith, high-level play and close family demands at Brigham Young University in Utah — the largest religious university in the country, located about 40 miles from his hometown — but chose not to do so.
Instead, the fullback looked to USC to help develop his talents and take him to the next level. As a standout running back out of Cottonwood High School in the heavily Mormon-populated Salt Lake City, Utah, Havili was strongly recruited by former BYU quarterback-turned-Trojan offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian. The two maintained a close relationship during their shared time at USC.
Havili’s decision to become a Trojan rather than go to the Church-centered university was “easy,” he said, because he wanted to compete with the best players in the nation.
“If I couldn’t compete here, then I’m not meant to play football anywhere else,” he said.
Havili saw some early playing time as a true freshman at USC in 2006, filling in at his usual fullback position.
Not before long, roadblocks were piling up in front of the rookie. His inaugural season with the Trojans was cut short when he broke his tibia early on playing against Arizona. And at the end of the season, Sarkisian flirted with the idea of filling the head coaching position with the Oakland Raiders, a move that would take him out of USC and away from his prized recruit Havili.
Faced with an approaching 19th birthday, a broken leg, the prospect of a close coach walking away and the lingering vision of going on a mission trip — something he had always imagined doing — Havili faced a decision that would ultimately decide his future as a football player. The fullback had to choose between staying to play football at USC and leaving for two years.
“My dad and mom wanted me to go on a mission, but it was totally up to me,” Havili said. “It was whatever felt right — [the decision] wasn’t concrete. I didn’t know if I was going to stay or go.”
He did what he had been taught to do his entire life — look to his faith for answers.
“We prayed and prayed, and we got a few blessings, and [staying to play football] is what I decided to do,” Havili said. “I needed to pursue this.”
Since then, Havili has committed to working toward a career as a professional football player, and he plans to enter the upcoming draft after he finishes his senior season.
Although the NFL remains the ultimate goal, the prospect of fulfilling his mission still lingers.
“Hopefully down the road when I’m married and retired, I can go on my mission,” he said.
Havili might have postponed his hiatus from the working world, but the senior remains anchored in his beliefs. When asked about how he currently balances his faith, football, school and the day-to-day rigors of collegiate life, he said he always remembers one lesson.
“Live your life the right way, the way you have been taught from primary on,” he said. “Live and do the right thing.”
Cougar fans wish Havili had come to BYU too, maybe if more of the top LDS athletes would go to BYU the Cougars wouldn’t be having a 5-5 season like they are this year.
USC got a great athlete.
@Tyler   “I wish the kid would have went to BYU.”  Obviously, you don’t go to USC or you’re definitely in remedial English.
Havili will never be half the player Petros Papadakis was.  Petros had heart, something Havili doesn’t have.  I wish the kid would have went to BYU.  He hasn’t really done anything for us.

For all that was supposed to change for USC this season, this month could be shaping up to be the perfect November Trojan fans are used to.
Under Pete Carroll, USC used to own the 11th month of the year. The Trojans were 29-1 in November under Carroll (winning 28 in a row), before Stanford broke the streak in embarrassing fashion last year.
The November mystique that seemed to follow USC meant one thing: The Trojans got used to finishing. They got stronger as the season went on, which built momentum for an upcoming bowl game.
It’s well known that there will be no bowling for the 7-3 Trojans this year. But other than that, if all goes according to plan these next three weeks, USC could be looking at another 10-win season propelled by a perfect November and a strong finish.
The Trojans got the toughest test out of the way last weekend, jumping out to an early lead and holding on for a tough road win against then-No. 18 Arizona. The win made the Trojans suddenly relevant again in the national landscape, earning them a No. 20 ranking in the AP poll.
Now, the Trojans prepare for three games in which they should be heavy favorites.
First up are the quickly unraveling Beavers. It’s not just that Oregon State has dropped two games in a row, but rather who it lost them to: a 17-14 defeat at the hands of UCLA at the Rose Bowl, then the unfathomable 31-14 home loss to Washington State.
(That is not a misprint. And yes, this is the same Cougar team whose only other win this season was a narrow 23-22 victory over Montana State).
With the Beavers in total turmoil, even the Trojans should be able to overcome their horrible track record in the state of Oregon. The Trojans swear the Beavers don’t poison the water up there, but I have my doubts; the fact remains that the Trojans have not won in the state since 2005.
Against the Beavers, the Trojans have come away dejected in their last two trips to Corvallis, Ore., including a shocking loss in 2008 when they were ranked No. 1.
But those Oregon losses usually came when the Trojans were looking past seemingly weaker opponents. What makes these Trojans different is USC coach Lane Kiffin, who doesn’t allow his team to look past anyone.
Plus, in this sanctioned season, the Trojans don’t have anything to look to. Everything is about the present.
After the Trojans get past the Beavers, they get their two rivalry games in succession: Notre Dame followed by UCLA.
Point spreads aren’t supposed to matter in rivalry games, so the fact that Notre Dame is 5-5 and UCLA is 4-5 has little bearing. But don’t you think that with their season knowingly stunted by NCAA penalties, the Trojans will play with a little more fire in what amounts to their championship games?
Notre Dame has to visit the Coliseum for USC’s last home game.
That means it will be Senior Day. A whole slew of Trojan seniors (and a lot of juniors) will be playing at the Coliseum for the last time before trying to make it at the next level. Even though the Fighting Irish just upset No. 15 Utah, I can’t see the Trojans losing this game on a day that carries so much emotional weight.
Then there is only room left for the finale, and how fitting that it comes against UCLA on Dec. 4. There will be the usual Los Angeles bragging rights at stake but also some real ones for the Bruins, who might be fighting for bowl eligibility if they manage to win one of their two games before USC.
It will be USC’s last game of the year and the final stark reminder that there is no postseason. The current USC players have had to pay for past transgressions. Here’s guessing that they’ll take that frustration out on the Bruins.
When the curtains do finally close on this season, we could be looking at a 10-win Trojan team, one that went undefeated in November and one that could easily have been two wins richer if not for a few late-game stumbles.
For all that has changed in a year around USC, these Trojans should deliver the kind of ending we’re used to.
