A Fresh & Easy Express, located under University Gateway apartments on Jefferson Boulevard, will hold its grand opening on Wednesday.
At the event, the store will promote its services to the entire neighborhood’s students, said Brendan Wonnacott, director of communications for Fresh & Easy.
“We want to introduce ourselves to the community and appeal to the entire neighborhood, not just USC students,” Wonnacott said.
The new store will be an express version of a Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market, which will allow the store to offer more products in a smaller location.

“It will be one of our first express stores and will be about one-third of the size of a standard Fresh & Easy,” Wonnacott said. “We see our express stores as offering the best of Fresh & Easy and each store still carries about half of the products offered at a standard Fresh & Easy.”
Wonnacott said the goal of the grocery store is to give customers convenient meals and snacks.
“The vision of Fresh & Easy is to make fresh food accessible, so, like all our stores, this Fresh & Easy Express will carry prepackaged food that is prepared daily at our Riverside Distribution Center and delivered fresh to each store every morning,” Wonnacott said. “That way a businessman or a student on the go can pick up lunch that is prepackaged, but also fresh.”
Reagan Rose, a freshman majoring in mathematics, is excited about the prospect of a new grocery store near campus.
“Many students, including myself, sometimes struggle to find quick, fresh food around campus, mainly because the options are too expensive or unhealthy,” Rose said, “Fresh & Easy will provide a good balance between quick and healthy food, and will probably be a big attraction for students who live on-campus or in Gateway.”
Kathryn Kinas, a freshman majoring in business administration, said she is excited about the Fresh & Easy opening because she has shopped at the store before.
“We have a Fresh & Easy near my house, and I always go there for their sandwiches,” Kinas said. “I really like that they are like normal supermarkets, but also have a wider variety of specialty food.”
Unless they sell chicken and pigs feet I’m not shopping there
Natural part of the gentrification process….all of a sudden people in the ‘hood deserve good food.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety daily incident log between Friday, Feb. 10, and Saturday, Feb. 11. 
Crimes against a person
At 2:55 a.m. on Feb. 11, two suspects approached two students who were sitting on a retaining wall near 34th Street and Trousdale Parkway and one of the suspects demanded the students’ property.  The students refused to comply and attempted to walk away. A suspect brandished a machete and attempted to block the students’ escape. A struggle ensued and the students and the suspect fell to the ground. One of the students managed to disarm the suspect and she called DPS while the second student restrained him. Both suspects were detained by DPS officers, arrested and transported to 77th station for booking.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:40 p.m. on Feb. 11, LAPD officers responded to a report of a staff member involved in a dispute with her boyfriend at Fluor Tower. The officers determined that the altercation was verbal only and cleared the scene after observing no signs of injury to either party.
At 2:12 a.m. on Feb. 11, DPS officers transported two intoxicated students from Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street to their residence and, upon their arrival, one of them began vomiting and passed out on a restroom floor. An LAFD RA unit was requested and Unit #15 responded. The RA unit examined the student who had passed out and transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 2:07 a.m. on Feb. 11, a student reported that her intoxicated friend, also a student, had been forcibly taken to a fraternity house by two unidentified males and she feared for the subject’s safety because she was unable to care for herself. The student could not be located by DPS officers during a search of the fraternity house and they subsequently learned that she had returned to her residence unharmed after being escorted home by an unidentified subject.
at 1:34 a.m. on Feb. 11, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student in Parkside Residential Building who was reported to be unable to care for herself. The student was unable to stand on her own and became combative when contacted by the officers, so she was restrained and an LAFD RA unit was requested. RA Unit #10 responded and examined the student, and then transported her to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 1:20 a.m. on Feb. 11, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated student in Trojan Heights who was reported to be unable to care for himself. The student was vomiting and incoherent when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student. The student was transported to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 9:33 p.m. on Feb. 10, two students were cited to Student Judicial Affairs for possession of alcohol and marijuana in a dorm room at College Residential Hall.
at 3:16 p.m. on Feb. 10, the Delta Chi fraternity was cited to Student Judicial Affairs for creating a safety issue by allowing several students to drink on the roof of its house.  Two students were also cited for smoking marijuana in their room.
ahhhhh….memories…somethings never change.
It’s amazing how factually inaccurate the Row related stories are.
I love Friday and Saturday Night Roundup!

Candidates for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president at the first USG Candidate Diversity Forum Monday night used their platforms and personal anecdotes to address how their administrations would view and promote diversity.  About 100 students attended the public forum in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
Following the discussion, candidates for USG Senate were given one minute to introduce their platforms to the audience.
Q & A · Five students asked candidates a variety of questions ranging from LGBT issues to how the Master Plan will affect the community. - Yasamin Yeganeh | Daily Trojan
The discussion was organized by Program Board’s assemblies to encourage dialogue about diversity during USG elections.
“There was never really a chance for the candidates to discuss issues of diversity before they are elected,” said Eric Burse, director of the Black Student Assembly. “A lot of the candidates like to come talk to the different assemblies before the election, so we decided to consolidate that into one and have a diversity forum.”
The forum was moderated by Jade Agua, assistant director of Asian Pacific American Student Services.
All of the candidates said they would be more involved with cultural assemblies within USG.
Presidential candidate Mikey Geragos, USG’s director of university affairs, said he would achieve this goal by integrating Program Board with USG’s advocacy efforts.
“There is this idea that is currently present in USG that there is the programming side of things, and then there is the advocacy side of things,” Geragos said.
Candidates addressed the relationship between the Greek community and other communities on campus at one point. The candidates specifically addressed Greek discrimination toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.
Presidential candidate Jared Ginsburg’s running mate Sam Coxe, an active member of Delta Gamma, said she has been a long supporter of curbing LGBT discrimination within the Greek system and told a story about standing up for a student who was kicked out of a fraternity because of his sexual orientation.
“I took the boy, dragged him into the fraternity and went in and talked to the president,” Coxe said. “That guy didn’t even know what to say. I just went off.”
The forum revealed a difference between the candidates when they were asked whether they believed USG was diverse. While both Geragos and Ginsburg said they feel the student makeup of USG is diverse, presidential candidate Theo Offei said he felt USG could be more diverse.
“USG should reflect the student body of USC,” Offei said. “I’ve heard from a lot of students who do not feel they belong in USG. We have a great opportunity of changing that.”
The forum turned personal after Agua asked each candidate for instances in their life when they had felt like outsiders.
Geragos said his weight had often made him feel self-conscious in social situations, but he addressed the problem by pushing himself, an example of which was joining his high school water polo team.
“Not only did I embrace the teasing and mockery sometimes, but I also did things that pushed me,” Geragos said.
Ginsburg, USG’s director of Campus Affairs, said his weight also made him feel uncomfortable.  Ginsburg said he lost weight before the election.
“I used to be 35 pounds heavier,” Ginsburg said. “I know what it is like to be in that pool also and not want to take your shirt off.”
Offei said he experienced feeling like an outsider after he moved from Italy to the United States because of his accent.
“It feels like, again, I’m the outsider,” Offei said. “I always try to go with the flow, just respect people as much as you can, be yourself and everything will be fine.”
The forum was held by the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Black Student Assembly, the International Student Assembly, the Latino/a Student Assembly, Women’s Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly.
Cody Vu, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said he felt the candidates’ answers were too broad and did not address specific groups.
“They tried to address everyone as a whole rather than get to specific points about anything,” Vu said. “They didn’t go much beyond just that diversity is important.”
Voting for USG elections begins Tuesday and will continue until Thursday. Preliminary results will be announced Tuesday, Feb. 21 and final results will be released the next week.

Plenty of actors have found a way of capitalizing on their niche. Angelina Jolie plays a great bad girl, Rachel McAdams is famous for her romantic-comedy charm and Michael Cera always takes on the role of the awkward teenage fanboy.
Though two-time Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington is in a league far ahead of Jolie, McAdams and Cera, the concept of the niche still exists. In the past decade, Washington’s roles are clear imitations of each other: No one can play the wise and out-of-control mentor/villain quite like him.
Washington’s typical role consists of him taking on a young apprentice and helping him reach his nirvana moment. These glib, but intelligent men have hearts of gold and are completely blind to the corruption surrounding them. There might be lots of blood and gun fights, like in Training Day, or it could be a more subdued affair like The Great Debaters. Either way, Washington is there to save the day.
Safe House, Washington’s newest feature, is no different. Here, Washington hits his stride, taking on a role that he and the audience are comfortable seeing him in — and one that he obviously enjoys portraying.
Washington plays the rogue CIA agent Tobin Frost, a man who has been selling agency secrets for nine years. One day, Frost receives a computerized file, which he casually injects into his thigh for safekeeping.
How does the audience know that this file is important? Instead of slyly keeping the audience in the dark, director Daniel Espinosa chooses to be painstakingly obvious.
The bad guys continuously say, “We need that file!” with mediocre delivery, and Frost checks that the file is still safe throughout the film, complete with close-ups to ensure the audience that this is an incredibly important file.
Hoping to escape the usual foreign bad guys, Frost walks into the United States Consulate in Capetown. Taken to the agency’s safe house, Frost meets Matthew Weston (Ryan Reynolds).
After a skirmish here and there and gun sequences far too long to be genuinely exciting, Frost convinces Weston to get them both out of the safe house — a move that any audience member can see coming.
What follows is a madcap adventure throughout the beautiful country of South Africa, mixed with some CIA drama back in Langley and an unnecessary subplot involving Weston’s French girlfriend.
The film wants to pride itself on having the two superstars, Washington and Reynolds, assume their best “I’m calm” and “I’m scared” faces, but the sub-characters’ emotions only range from confused to more confused. The audience knows this because the dialogue is mostly composed of  “Why would Tobin Frost walk into the Consulate,” “What does the file contain,” and “We’re trying to figure that out.”
Yes, it all does seem oddly predictable. Safe House attempts to present itself as a taut psychological thriller, but when you’ve seen all the tricks before, the film loses part of its potential.
At times, Safe House appears to be an opportunity for Washington to deliver lines like, “I’m already in your head” with trademark calm force. At other points, Reynolds presents his best scared-but-strong bravado.
Espinosa fails to do what the Bourne trilogy did so well: surprise and excite. Instead of following our hero along for the journey, viewers will find that they simply know too much about the situation to be further compelled.
In a thriller, predictability is a killer — and Safe House is a floundering victim.
The film could have been a truly intriguing night out at the movies if Espinosa had not decided to not play by the rules so closely.
What saves Safe House from the dark abyss of forgotten action thrillers is camera work, including some fine shaky-cam technique courtesy of cinematographer Oliver Wood.
Despite the preliminary sea-sickness feeling you might get from the shaky-cam, the beautifully saturated tones and Bourne-like sporadic movements elevate the film, infusing it with a touch of realism and saving it from points of mediocrity and implausible activity.
Yet, the film’s flaws can’t be denied.  All the audience wants is a cause for spectacle, a night of surprises and heart-racing action. But since we know exactly who is going to get shot when, the excitement fades.
In his next effort, Espinosa needs to figure out what kind of film he is making. As a mind-exercising thriller, Safe House fails. Though it does strangely succeed as a form of B-rated fun, Safe House is a perfect example of a film that could have been so much more.

In the Nazi-occupied Poland of In Darkness, life has its shades of gray.
There are no clear heroes or villains, despite the murder of Jewish refugees at the hands of soldiers. In some instances, the heroes possess traits of evil, while villains possess traits of good.
Director Agnieszka Holland’s Academy Award-nominated film, In Darkness, deals with the tragedies that took place in Poland during the German occupation.
The film takes its inspiration from Robert Marshall’s book, In the Sewers of Lvov, and follows Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz), a Polish sewer worker who moonlights as a burglar, stealing from people’s homes and later hiding their jewels and money in the sewers he works in. Socha — or Poldek, as his friends call him — comes across Jews seeking refuge from Nazi soldiers.
Fortunately for the persecuted Jews, Poldek knows just the place to hide them: the sewers.
The film, as the title promises, takes place in the darkness. The Jews end up living in the sewer system beneath the city of Lvov — now Lviv, Ukraine — for an extended period of time. Holland is not afraid to invite the audience into the Jews’ world. Though striking, the cinematography for the film creates an unattractive setting that is purposefully dark and hopeless.
The group, which includes a couple, a religious man and children, among others, all must depend on each other for survival. Though their lives will forever change in these sewers, In Darkness does a wonderful job of showing that they keep hope alive that they will once again see the light of day.
In Darkness also effectively contrasts what takes place both below ground in the sewers and above ground in the city, where the remaining Jews are murdered or tortured. In the sewers, they are surrounded in darkness and Holland emphasizes how difficult life is for these victims.
This contrasts well with scenes that take us into the city above, where gruesome murders take place in broad daylight. The Jews in the sewers are confined and helpless, but life above is equally as devastating. Holland is very resourceful with her camera, drawing parallels between both worlds.
Poldek’s actions are evocative of Oskar Schindler from Schindler’s List. Unlike the hero in Steven Spielberg’s paradigmatic film, however, Poldek’s intentions are selfish. Poldek assists the Jews only because they pay him more than the Germans would for turning them in.
The characters in the film — Poldek, in particular — are carefully sketched in their development, built to reaffirm the notion of moral ambiguity. Poldek is a flawed hero, and Robert Wieckiewicz’s performance shows his deep desperation in times of anguish.
There are moments in the film that suggest Poldek’s intentions with the Jews expand beyond self-regard. The writing of the film emphasizes that life isn’t always black and white and that sometimes emotions change over the course of time.
In addition, In Darkness drops the viewer directly among the Jews in the rat-infested sewers, creating a deep sense of claustrophobia.
The decision to film in such tight spaces, coupled with the film’s longer running time of 145 minutes, creates a sense of pervasive uneasiness. The audience feels trapped and confined, leaving little room for identification with the characters of the story.
In some sense, Holland cleverly tests the audience’s patience, especially when the camera remains fixated on gruesome events.
In Darkness is a poignant film, and one that provides audiences with an understanding of the complexities of human emotion. The film sheds light on the Holocaust in a unique manner, showing viewers genuine individual perspectives.
In Darkness also resonates in its final moments and allows its audience to empathize with its characters.
This, however, is also its problem. Holland excels in establishing a sense of objectivity throughout the film, but reaches for a fulfilling, inspiring ending in the climax of the film.
The relationship that is established with the characters on the screen feels real, and the audience takes satisfaction in finding such a connection with characters that pertain to genocide.
In some sense, it is as if Holland wants her audience to feel good rather than accurately inform us about an historic event.
The narrative satisfaction, along with the feeling of warmth that the audience walks away with, can feel opportunistic.  Though In Darkness ends on what can feel like a forced note, it still remains a deeply emotive and unique look at one of history’s darkest chapters.

“Do TV and no one will ever take you seriously again.”
If viewers were asked to explain why they laughed at this line, spoken by ultra conservative network executive Jack Donaghy on 30 Rock, the most common response would likely be along the lines of: “Because it’s true.”
Entertainment crossover · The legendary comedian Danny DeVito (right), of Twins and Matilda, is one of many actors making the leap from film to television. His series on FX, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, is currently in its seventh season and is lined up for an eighth. - Photo courtesy of FOX Flash
Context certainly plays a role in understanding the joke. Though Donaghy might have spoken the words, it was an Academy Award-nominated actor — Alec Baldwin — who delivered the line.
Like an ever-growing list of his peers currently working in television, Baldwin was once principally known for his work in film before falling into the role he might very well be remembered for. After racking up impressive credits, such as The Hunt for Red October and The Departed, Baldwin’s dramatic acting chops seemed to have been fairly well established and his eligibility to work in film assured. So why move to television?
For starters, it’s not at all clear that everyone feels that the transition from big to small screen is necessarily a downgrade. If the number of movie stars currently moonlighting on TV is any indication, the “de-stigmatization of television” appears to be in full effect, if not complete.
I didn’t take notice of the trend until ABC’s Brothers & Sisters, which ended last year, showcased Oscar-winner Sally Field in a leading role in every episode of its five-season run, but the signs are everywhere.
Kathy Bates, who received a best actress statue for her turn as crazed fan Annie Wilkes in Misery, is now ex-patent lawyer Harriet Korn in Harry’s Law on NBC. Danny DeVito, best known to our generation as the indifferent father in Matilda and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brother in Twins, stars in FX’s It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Jessica Lange, co-star of Sydney Pollack’s Tootsie, recently completed a scene-stealing first season as Constance Langdon in American Horror Story, also on FX.
The list goes on. But it wasn’t until one of the greatest living actors, Dustin Hoffman, settled into a regular role as career gambler Chester “Ace” Bernstein on HBO’s horseracing drama Luck that many began to feel that the transition was officially complete. With Rain Man himself doing TV, any lingering feelings of supremacy film actors might have felt toward their television counterparts flew out the window.
Getting to the root cause of the rampant crossovers we’ve seen in recent years requires more than one explanation, but in Hoffman’s case, taking a chance on Luck wasn’t much of a risk at all: With NYPD Blue and Deadwood creator David Milch spearheading the series as writer and executive producer, the quality of the show was all but assured.
It’s no coincidence that, like Hoffman, many small screen converts made a premium cable network the first stop on their migratory pattern. Character actor Steve Buscemi’s first consistent TV role was on The Sopranos on HBO, the same network on which he now headlines Boardwalk Empire. Similarly, Showtime boasts big-name actors such as Claire Danes, Don Cheadle and Laura Linney on Homeland, House of Lies and The Big C, respectively.
Premium channels’ brand identities are completely dependent on the quality of their programming and originality of their content — and they better be, if they expect customers to pay a premium in excess of their usual cable bills. But the quality writing and storytelling meant to attract subscribers serves the double purpose of attracting great actors to the projects as well.
Another explanation (and one that’s not exclusive to premium networks) has to do with the unique challenge presented by the television format to actors primarily accustomed to the one-off nature of film. In movies, actors give a performance once — maybe a few times to get coverage, or if a picky director wants multiple takes — and are done with it.
Just like acting on stage, which offers the opportunity to explore a character’s nuances and to refine performances from one show to the next, acting for television offers an enticing opportunity to commit to a character that — unlike one in the theater — grows and evolves organically, from one episode to the next, one season after another. And, given the increasingly serialized nature of TV, the character arcs that actors can explore are increasingly meatier.
Thanks in large part to actors such as Baldwin, Macy, Field and Hoffman, the perceived stigma of television seems to finally be a thing of the past.
One appeal of acting on the small screen that you rarely hear discussed is the allure of a regular paycheck, week in and week out. Who knows? Someday soon you might even see Helen Mirren or Judi Dench hamming it up on the small screen — even the greatest of Dames has to eat too, you know.

Valentine’s Day brings a flurry of romantic comedies — cue He’s Just Not That Into You and the mothership of Feb. 14-themed films, Valentine’s Day.  Romantic comedies come with the territory, namely flowers and chocolate.
This year is no different.
Your cinematic options might seem limited in emotional depth this holiday. There’s The Vow, in which Channing Tatum — the epitome of eye candy — must win over his wife (Rachel McAdams) after she suffers severe memory loss.
There’s also This Means War, a crime romance film featuring two CIA operatives (Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) — more eye candy — vying for the affection of one blonde bombshell (Reese Witherspoon). Neither look that impressive.
It’s time to leave mindless tearjerkers behind and to head back to the basics. Valentine’s Day is, at least in theory, about love and the various forms that love can take.
To celebrate that love, here are a few films that take a more unconventional — and real — look at romance.
 
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
 
Low-key indie treasure Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which won an Oscar for  best original screenplay, expresses love not through the initial process of discovery, but through the realization of what has been lost.
Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star as the introverted Joel and the peculiar Clementine, a bitter couple whose relationship has gone downhill, leading the pair to erase their memories of each other.
During the procedure, Joel realizes it’s better to retain his past because it contains good as well as bad memories. A fight against time follows as Joel attempts to escape the procedure and to preserve the love.
Director Michel Gondry’s cult classic takes a backward approach to romance, presenting it in a non-linear fashion. Told through a hodgepodge of memories — think (500) Days of Summer — Eternal Sunshine entices viewers with its heartbreaking thematic connection of particular moments throughout Joel and Clementine’s relationship. The viewer cannot help but be entranced because he or she has no idea what’s coming next: Will it be childhood memories, first dates, breakups or makeups?
Funnyman Carrey gives the performance of his career as the dark and suspicious Joel, and Winslet matches this excellence as the eccentric Clementine. The exemplary acting goes hand-in-hand with the awe-inspiring, non-consecutive series of events. And it’s all wrapped up nicely with a perfectly quirky and melancholic air.
Eternal Sunshine takes a stylistic approach to filmmaking. At its core, it is a love story that forces viewers to realize what’s right in front of them.
Brokeback Mountain
 
Ang Lee’s 2005 drama Brokeback Mountain was labeled as the “gay cowboy movie” through popular discourse.
This superficial assessment hardly does the director, the cast and the film justice. Brokeback Mountain stands apart as an honest and emotive tale of love.
This hot-topic film explores uncharted cinematic territory and gives new meaning to LGBT representations in cinema as it features Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) as Wyoming cowboys suffering from repressed romantic feelings for each other.
Oscar winner for best director, best original score and best adapted screenplay, Brokeback Mountain expresses a sense of true cinematic genius through its stunning cinematography, especially evident in expansive shots of the beautiful Wyoming landscape.
Ledger and Gyllenhaal deliver compelling performances as a distraught couple fighting to balance their feelings and societal norms. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway make their marks as brilliant supporting  actresses cast by portraying the wives who have been pushed aside and now act as covers to their husbands’ forbidden romance.
The melodrama takes an uncommon approach to love by media standards in the sense that Ennis and Jack’s relationship has rarely been addressed in film. This devastating relationship is what ultimately captures viewers.
Unconventionality aside, Brokeback Mountain candidly portrays two men fighting for each other despite societal norms, and this hopeless love makes the film incredibly romantic.
Talk to Her
 
Spanish filmmaker and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Pedro Almodóvar’s critically acclaimed film, Talk to Her (Habla con Ella), explores the relationship between women in comas and the men who love them.
To say the premise is obscure would be an understatement. This assessment, however, only applies to its concept, not to its execution.
The relationships are delicate, complex and beautifully developed. Darío Grandinetti delivers a subtle yet honest performance as Marco, a writer whose bullfighter girlfriend is in a coma after suffering an accident. Upon realizing that she had been cheating on him, he begins to fall in love with another comatose woman and must compete with a male nurse/friend for the unconscious woman’s affection.
In Almodóvar’s eccentric and unexpected style, this male-centric romantic melodrama is delivered with vibrant colors, suspenseful plot twists and surprising scandal. The unconventional love presented in Talk to Her might          not be ethical, and in fact leads to some serious criminal trouble, but effectively demonstrates one of the many forms that love can take. The film Talk to Her offers a unique approach and asks many questions about the definition of love.
Give your sweetheart the gift of a unique experience this Valentine’s Day. These unique romance films will certainly serve as a nice change of pace.

USC coach Lane Kiffin filled two openings on his coaching staff with the hiring of Scottie Hazelton and Marvin Sanders on Sunday.
According to the Los Angeles Times, Hazelton, formerly the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for North Dakota State, will replace Joe Barry as linebackers coach, and Sanders, Florida Atlantic’s defensive coordinator, will step in as the new defensive backs coach.
Barry left USC two weeks ago after a two-year stint to join the San Diego Chargers staff as linebackers coach, while USC’s previous defensive backs coach, Willie Mack Garza, resigned the day before the 2011 season. Graduate assistant Sammy Knight served as interim defensive backs coach.
The only vacant position on the football staff is receivers’ coach, which opened up when Ted Gilmore left after one season to fill the same position for the Oakland Raiders.

Students walk by Cromwell Field every day, but do most know of the legacy inside?
Just within the front gate is a tribute to USC track star Louis Zamperini.
Ahead of the pack · USC’s track and field team should look to Louis Zamperini for inspiration and Trojan spirit this season. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
With the 2012 track and field season in progress, the rising stars of USC should look toward the story of Zamperini for inspiration.
Deemed a troublemaker in his early childhood, the Torrance, Calif., native found solace through running track.
In 1934, Zamperini set a world interscholastic record for the mile at the state championships with a time of 4:21.2.
One week later, he clinched the championship with a 4:27.8 mile. It wasn’t long before USC him for the team.
Zamperini earned a spot on the 1936 Olympic team, running the 5,000-meter event.
He placed eighth in the race held in Berlin, catching the eye of Adolf Hitler. The dictator was so taken with Zamperini’s performance that he demanded to meet the track star.
After an iconic trip to the 1936 Olympic Games, Zamperini set his sights on the 1940 games in Tokyo.  In 1938, he represented USC at the NCAA championships. Dealing with gruesome injuries (cracked ribs, sliced shins and bleeding toes), Zamperini set a NCAA record with 4:08.3 mile. He was close to breaking the four-minute mile, but something much bigger dashed those aspirations.
At the height of World War II, Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Force.  Soon after, Zamperini was deployed to Hawaii to serve as a bombardier.  He and his crew boarded a B-24 in May 1943 to search for a missing crew. After the first B-24 was massacred with bullets, the crew boarded a second aircraft. Named “The Green Hornet,” the aircraft plummeted into the ocean after enduring mechanical difficulties. The crash killed eight of the 11 men onboard. Zamperini, Russell Philips (pilot), and Francis McNamara (tail-gunner) survived the ordeal.
Back home, Zamperini had been declared dead. But surviving shark attacks and Japanese bomb attempts, the three men floated in the middle of the vast sea for 33 days before McNamara’s passing. Zamperini and Philips reached the Marshall Islands by the 47th day and were eventually captured by the Japanese Navy. Both endured multiple prisoner of war camps before being released.
Celebrating his 95th birthday last month, Zamperini’s story continues to be motivational. Seabiscuit author Lauren Hillenbrand’s 2010 Unbroken serves as a record of the life of a hero from USC.
And Zamperini’s post-war life has become just as honorable as his war exploits. He has become a true source of inspiration through his great acts of charity and compassion.
As Trojans, we should look to Zamperini for inspiration to continue the Trojan spirit and, in his words, “Be Hardy.”

On Saturday, USC’s men’s and women’s track and field teams traveled to College Station, Texas to compete in the Texas A&M Indoor Invitational. The single-day event, which took place in Gilliam Indoor Stadium, saw the A&M Aggies host seven other teams: Alabama, Baylor, Houston, Missouri, Rice, Texas Christian University and the University of Texas El Paso.

The men’s team arrived to compete ranked outside the top-25 by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association for the third week of the indoor season. The Women of Troy came into the meet with a ranking of 68.
All schools came to the College Station following A&M’s New Balance Collegiate Invitational performance, in which the Aggie men placed first (10 points ahead of rival Lousiana State University) and the Aggie women placed fourth.
The individual titles the Aggies earned at the New Balance Collegiate Invitational would carry over to the Indoor Invitational. Texas A&M men’s and women’s teams finished first in points — the men by a margin of 106 points, and the women by a margin of 57.5. The USC men’s team finished ninth with 22 points, and the USC women’s team finished eighth with 43 points.
The USC men’s team placed in three individual events at the meet. Sophomore Viktor Fajoyomi finished second in two events: long jump (7.26 m) and high jump (2.04 m). Freshman Allen Williams finished third in the men’s 60 m hurdles.
The women placed in two individual events and one relay event. Freshman Melia Cox finished second in the triple jump with a leap of 40-2 (12.24 m). Junior Alitta Boyd finished third in the long jump (5.99 m).
The women’s 4×400 m relay team (freshman Akawkaw Ndipagbor, senior Dalilah Muhammad, freshman Vanessa Jones and senior Aareon Payne) placed second (3:38.47). Sophomore Jessica Davis finished fourth in the women’s 60 m dash finals.
Payne and Ndipagbor went on to finish fifth and seventh, respectively, in the women’s 200 m dash finals. Muhammad also finished sixth in the Women’s 60 m Hurdles, with sophomore Lauren Blackburn finishing seventh. Senior Anniya Louis placed seventh in the women’s 800.
USC’s track and field teams placed in more events than its previous meet, the New Balance Collegiate Invitiational in New York. The Texas A&M Invitational is the final indoor meet before the conference championships are held.
Texas A&M rose above the competition at Gilliam Stadium with the Aggies recording 15 total wins at the meet. Missouri finished second in the men’s standings with 95 points; Baylor finished third with 82. Baylor also finished second in the women’s standings with 118 points while Missouri finished third with 77 points. The track and field team’s next scheduled event is Feb. 25 at the Claremont Relays in Claremont, Calif.

The 16th-ranked Women Of Troy upset No. 8 North Carolina and No. 17 Tennessee en route to their first semifinals appearance in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championships since 2003 before falling to Pac-12 rival UCLA 4-0.
Heavy hitter · Freshman Gabrielle DeSimone (above) won a singles match to help the Women of Troy make up for lost ground. USC upset two top-20 teams en route to making its first semifinals appearance in the ITA National Indoor Championships since the 2003 season. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
“This has been a great start and if someone had said in September that we’d be in the semis of the ITA National Indoors and back in top 10 at 7-1, I would obviously take that,” coach Richard Gallien said.
“But the good news for us is that we’re pretty damn good. The level of talent is higher than I thought it was going to be and the level of maturity is higher as well.”
Coming in as one of the lowest ranked teams in the tournament, USC (7-1) showed off the resiliency that Gallien has talked about this season after fighting back against North Carolina on Friday.
After losing the doubles’ point, the Women of Troy made up ground in singles with three straight wins by sophomore Kaitlyn Christian and freshmen Gabrielle DeSimone and Sabrina Santamaria.
Despite senior Alison Ramos dropping the next match to pull North Carolina within one point, junior Danielle Lao provided a much-needed boost with a match-clinching, comeback victory against No. 44 Zoe DeBruycker (5-7, 7-5, 6-4).
On Saturday, the Women of Troy faced off against the Tennessee squad, who, like USC, had scored an upset win the previous day against No. 5 Baylor.
For the second straight day, Coach Richard Gallien’s group failed to secure a point in the doubles’ round, despite a spirited effort by the No. 3  team of Christian/Santamaria, who fell to Pluskota/Williams 9-7.
Once singles rolled around, the Women of Troy erased any concerns brought on by their lost doubles point as the same quartet of winners from Friday emerged victorious Saturday as well.
Though the order for this match may have been different, the freshman pair of Santamaria and DeSimone started and ended the singles round, respectively, with Christian and Lao sandwiching wins in between those two games.
“What Sabrina and Kaitlyn did in singles got us back in both matches and gave the team a big boost with really everyone contributing,” Gallien said.
Riding the confidence of two impressive wins the past two days, the Women of Troy seemed to be the dark horse candidates to run the table and win the ITA Indoor Championship.
Despite their wave of momentum heading into Sunday, the Women of Troy hit a road block on their road to the championship match in the form of Pac-12 rival UCLA.
Though they were able to overcome a loss in doubles during the past two matches, the loss of a point on Sunday proved too valuable to the Women of Troy, as they would then lose three successive matches in singles, ending with Gabrielle DeSimone bowing out in three sets to UCLA’s Kaitlyn Ray on court five.
Though the score might have looked a bit lopsided at its conclusion, the Women of Troy put up a valiant effort to try and stave off elimination with three matches going into three sets, including No. 19 freshman Zoe Scandalis’ match against No. 8 Anderson and Santamaria’s match against UCLA’s No. 70 Pamela Montez.
“This definitely was a successful weekend, after getting back into the top 10 this early in the season,” Gallien said. “We get another crack at UCLA in a few weeks and Cal and Texas coming up.“
When you are ranked 16th how is it an upset to defeat the #17 team in the rankings? Getting shutout by the
‘ruins offsets any earlier victories in my mind. Time for a change in the coaching staff after sixteen years of
one final four to show for all those years at the helm.

USG presidential candidates respond to missing campaign sign remarks.
In response to the comments made by Jared Ginsburg and Sam Coxe in response to their missing signs, our campaign finds it necessary to respond. The article, titled “USG campaign signs removed from Trousdale without permission” was published Feb. 10.
Ginsburg stated, “There is suspicion, on our part, that there is involvement, not by other candidates, necessarily, but by their supporters.”
Our campaign believes that this is a defamation of character, and we vehemently refute such comments.
We want to reaffirm that the foundation of our campaign is strongly based in our personal, ethical values and we do condemn any disrespectful actions towards any of the campaigns.
Every candidate in this race is working hard to make their dreams for this school a reality. and we thoroughly appreciate our competitors for sharing in our ambition and Trojan Pride.
Stealing signs is a small act and our campaign is about thinking big, dreaming big and stretching beyond petty campus politics.
We have met some amazing students in this process, students that we would be honored to represent and work with if we get the opportunity.
I cannot believe that these inspiring people, many of whom have never even voted in a USG election, would think of  disrespecting the election process nor would we ever do something to jeopardize or undermine our opportunity to represent them.
We are disappointed at the indication of anything to the contrary and would like to reaffirm our unwavering respect for this school and for each and every one of its students.

During my time at Marshall School of Business, I’ve found it difficult to convince business students to incorporate social or community benefits as an essential part of their business solutions. Persuading established business leaders might be even harder.
Hye You | Daily Trojan 
Today, however, many leading global case competitions are marching boldly in that direction. The Hult Global Case Challenge, an annual college and university case competition, provides a good example. Every year, the organization partners with a different, leading, nongovernmental organization and structures the competition around a real global issue.
The organization selected global water shortage for last year’s event; this year’s new challenge is global poverty.
The Marshall International Case Competition, which takes place Tuesday, traditionally ask students to solve a single corporation’s strategic challenges and managerial dilemmas. The competition, however, would benefit from further social and environmental consideration.
Similar to the Hult competition, the MICC is a world-class business case competition. This year, 20 out of 30 competing teams come from top-ranked international business schools, located in Egypt, Brazil, Denmark and other countries.
It is easy to accept that the Hult and the MICC serve different purposes. But it is important to note that their goals do not necessarily conflict. In fact, their goals can complement each other, adding to the fast-growing trend of incorporating global issues into sound business strategies.
In an article published in the February issue of the American Sociological Review, University of Michigan sociologists Alwyn Lim and Kiyoteru Tsutsui found that a “surprisingly large number of corporations commit to accepting social responsibility that often does not generate immediate or tangible benefits.” Corporate behavior isn’t always about profits and company publicity.
Furthermore, Accenture, a management consulting services company, recently released a report showing that many multinational corporations are seeking NGO partners who understand how to help make strategies meet investor and societal needs. The study found that more than 766 global business leaders across 25 industries and 100 countries believe their strategies should align with sustainable development outcomes. Additionally, more than 93 percent of CEOs believed sustainability would be important to the future success of their businesses.
Many leading U.S. business schools, such as the UC Berkeley Hass School of Business and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business, are following the trend. These schools already provide courses related to corporate social responsibility and sustainable business strategy building.
To some extent, the USC Marshall School of Business has jumped in. Many business courses related to social issues are already available to students. Last fall, the Society and Business Lab, in conjunction with the Sol Price School of Public Policy, announced a social entrepreneurship minor. The new minor aims to help students across different majors develop viable solutions to serious societal challenges and integrate social concerns into future business plans.
Along with the rising trend of incorporation of social issues into business strategies, Marshall’s new minor underscores the importance of social responsibility in the business world.
It might be unrealistic for Marshall students to give social concern an equal footing to the realities of business survival, but it seems prudent to keep social concern somewhere close to the top of a planning agenda.
I hope that in the future the competition will incorporate social considerations and test students’ ability to take on a multi-dimensional perspective.

The USC men’s basketball team lost its fourth consecutive game on Sunday, falling to the Stanford Cardinal (17-8, 7-6) 59-47. USC’s defeat was their 20th of the season, the first time the Trojans have lost at least 20 games since 1989, when they finished 10-22.
For the second time in four days, the Trojans (6-20, 1-12) played a competitive first 20 minutes but were unable to keep up with their opponents in the second half.
USC trailed 20-18 going into the break after forcing 10 turnovers and holding Stanford to an 8-24 shooting performance. But the Trojans didn’t fare any better, shooting 7-24 (29 percent) in the first half and 15-48 (31 percent) for the game. They were outscored 39-29 in the second half of play.
“We played pretty hard, but when you’re not making, you’re not making,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “When you force 18 turnovers and basically hold them to 40 percent shooting, that’s enough to win only if you score.”
USC received 13 points apiece from junior guard Greg Allen and freshman forward Byron Wesley. Wesley, however, was just 1-6 from the floor after pacing the Trojans with 10 early points.
“They made defensive changes,” Wesley said. “They switched to zone in the second half. That slowed me down a bit.”
USC’s leading scorer of the season, sophomore guard Maurice Jones, struggled offensively, finishing 2-14 and 6-7 at the free throw line en route to 10 points.
“Mo’s shots when he’s at the point are not nearly as good of shots for him when he’s off the ball,” O’Neill said. “He had a lot of wide-open looks that didn’t go down. The guy’s got to be fatigued, let’s face it, playing that amount of minutes all year long as a sophomore.”
Stanford was led by freshman guard Chasson Randle’s 16 points, while senior forward Josh Owens added 15 points and five rebounds of his own. Coach Johnny Dawkins utilized his entire roster on Sunday, as Owens was the only Cardinal player on the court for more than 30 minutes.
USC, meanwhile, had six players with at least 20 minutes of playing time, a point O’Neill made after the game.
“Every one of these guys is playing too many minutes,” O’Neill said. “They’re doing as well as they can.”
The Trojans have two days to prepare for their cross-town rivals, the UCLA Bruins, whom they will face Wednesday night at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. The Bruins (14-11, 7-6) lost their previous game on Feb. 11 to the Cal Golden Bears, 73-63.
Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. The game will be broadcast on Fox Sports Prime Ticket.

America has hopped on a fairytale wagon with films like the upcoming Mirror, Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman, both due this year.
Perhaps the success of 2006’s Pan’s Labyrinth got the wheels turning. Though an original story, the magical, fairies and fauns meshed well with civil war Spain. As well, Disney’s 2009 The Princess and the Frog gave the original tale a fun New Orleans twist. Fairytales can be a lot of fun for filmmakers – they can be silly and solid family films, or they can be dark and depraved morality plays. Though the latter is closer to canon, the former is easy enough to adapt. In upcoming cinema, directors have gone both ways.
Mirror, Mirror, starring Lily Collins and Julia Roberts, is a zanier take on Snow White. As it’s directed by The Fall’s Tarsem Singh, we know it’ll look gorgeous. The plot will be harder to judge. Tarsem’s screenplays run the gamut from amazing (The Fall) to ridiculous (The Immortals). Let’s hope Mirror, Mirror resembles the former. It premieres March 30th.
The second Snow White retelling is Snow White and the Huntsman, directed by Rupert Sanders. Unlike Mirror, Mirror, it’s less about magic and dresses and more about battle and bloodshed. Twilight’s Kristen Stewart, who plays Snow White, ditches that pansy Edward and takes up arms with the rugged Huntsman. Apparently, the Huntsman still can’t bring himself to cut Snow White’s heart out, even at the behest of Charlize Theron’s ravishing evil queen. Unlike in previous incarnations, he sticks around and trains Snow White to defend herself instead of needing a prince. Just two questions: how in seven hells is Kristen Stewart fairer than Charlize Theron? Also, will we find out in this version why the Prince comes across Snow White’s casket and wants to kiss her corpse? Find out June 1st.
Disney wanted to get on the Snow White train, but didn’t want to play third fiddle. Its original idea Snow and the Seven, in the works for a decade, is now The Order of the Seven. It will be a martial arts flick starring Saoirse Ronan. How this was originally a Snow White story I’ll never know.
Snow White is not alone in the fairytale frontier. French director Christophe Gans wants to craft a new version of Beauty and the Beast and feature Vincent Cassel as the Beast and Lea Seydoux as the female lead. Cassel recently appeared in Black Swan as the sleazy ballet director and Seydoux played the sexy French assassin in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Christopher Gans is best known to American audiences for his brilliant if erratic historic-action-horror film, Brotherhood of the Wolf. Filming starts in October.
Other fairytales coming to a cinema near you are Jack the Giant Killer, with Nicholas Hoult and Ewan McGregor. Another is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, a gothic rendition of the tale set 15 years after the siblings’ run-in with the witch. Both were originally in the works for 2012 but have gotten the pushback to 2013.

President Barack Obama released a 28 track Spotify playlist this past Thursday profiling some of his favorite music. While it is quite obvious that his staff handpicked each track, it is certainly notable to watch the Commander in Chief embrace some of today’s online media platforms. In addition to the Spotify playlist, Obama announced the release of this playlist on his Tumblr and Twitter accounts.
Taken at the face value, the track names included in Obama’s playlist alone are enough to inspire change, something I imagine he was going for. Some of the tracks that induce a spirit of perseverance are Raphael Saadiq’s “Keep Marchin’,” The Impression’s “Keep on Pushing,” REO Speedwagon’s “Roll With the Changes” and Ledisi’s “Raise Up”. Other choice track names include “Different People,” “Everyday America,” and “We Take Care of Our Own”.
One of the tracks that Obama was likely to have actually chosen is Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together,” especially in light of his brief rendition of Green’s hit at a fundraiser last month.
Roots drummer QuestLove, on his music blog Okayplayer, hypothesized on Obama’s involvement in Spotify with this statement:
I am pretty sure what Spotify gave Obama in return for this incredible bump (the government should not pick winners in the digital music industry!) is detailed, demographically parsed data about American listening habits, broken right down to the most-played songs in key voting districts in the swing states of Ohio, Michigan and Florida.
MSNBC also weighed in on the playlist, breaking down Obama’s motives in an article titled, “Obama’s Spotify Playlist: 7 Things It Says About His Campaign”. If the playlist is an effort to get votes and establish unity heading into the election, Obama, or rather his staff should have thought a little broader in creating their mixtape. The MSNBC article highlights key demographics that are ignored in music including America’s Latino population apparently represented by a Ricky Martin song, as well as women, due to the fact that only 6 songs on the 28 track playlist are by female vocalists.
