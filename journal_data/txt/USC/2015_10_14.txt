Following Tuesday’s Democratic primary debate, students met with a panel of guest speakers Wednesday afternoon to discuss issues such as the rise of Bernie Sanders and the overall state of the Democratic Party. The Students Talk Back event, hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, analyzed the debate from multiple perspectives and provided a forum for students to ask questions and provide insight on the race for the Democratic primary.
Guest panelists included Dario Frommer, a former California Assembly Majority Leader and current Unruh Institute Legislator-in-Residence and John Thomas, a consultant and strategist for Republican candidates throughout the state of California. Students also heard from Christina Wilkes, president of the USC College Democrats, and Leesa Danzek, vice president of the USC College Republicans. The debate was moderated by Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur and Daily Trojan News Assignments Editor Jack Walker.
Key issues discussed during the panel included the controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton, who remains the Democratic frontrunner despite having been plagued with accusations over her use of private email servers. Though some believe the email scandal has damaged Clinton’s campaign — leading Wilkes to call it “the scandal that keeps on giving” — others felt that Tuesday’s debate gave Clinton a chance to defend herself.
“This was her format,” Thomas said. “I think she did a great job and that she hit her marks — this really was her place to shine.”

Though some felt that Clinton’s performance might be strong enough to detract from the email scandal, Danzek believed that, ultimately, Tuesday’s debate would not change how voters felt about Clinton.
“I think that, at the end of the day, no matter how the debate went, it secured beliefs for both Democrats and Republicans,” Danzek said, pointing out that Clinton’s achievements as secretary of state can be interpreted differently depending on which political party is analyzing them.
Many students were eager to hear about the performance of dark horse candidate Bernie Sanders, who has been surging in the polls recently due to his progressive policies and appeal as a self-identified democratic socialist. Despite his popularity with certain members of the electorate, however, Frommer said that he still cannot gain widespread appeal with voters across the nation.
“Bernie Sanders is going to do well in states where you have a high percentage of Democratic voters who are white, well-educated, a little better off — I think that’s an appeal,” Frommer said. “If you look at some other states where you have a lot of voters who are Latino, African American or Asian American, it’s a different story. And that’s the challenge for Sanders — how do you get through that gauntlet?”

Wednesday’s panel also discussed issues such as the contrast between the Democratic and Republican debates, with several panelists pointing out that Tuesday’s debate was much more respectful and controlled, with fewer targeted attacks toward specific candidates.
“A lot of us expected a debate where candidates who are desperate for points were really going to jump on Hillary, but nobody did,” Frommer said. “They made their points respectfully, and they didn’t come after her very hard.”
Schnur and others from the Unruh Institute believe that the panel provided a more analytical approach to the debate, which allowed students to consider the issues from a different perspective.
“People have very strong opinions on who they think ought to be the next president, and they tend to argue very strongly and very loudly on behalf of their preferred candidate,” Schnur said. “What I like about this kind of program is that it’s not yelling, it’s not screaming — it’s conversation. For someone who’s not decided on which candidate they want to support, we’re giving them an opportunity to think about those candidates in a different context.”

I’m stumped · Senior Katie Stump recently released an EP. – Photo courtesy of Katie Stump
Senior popular music major Katie Stump was waiting in a Nashville terminal for her late flight to Los Angeles when she befriended a girl with a guitar. At the time, she had no idea that the friendship would change her life.
“I saw she had a guitar, [so] I went up to her, and I just started a conversation because I figured somebody on a plane from Nashville to L.A. with a guitar [was probably] somebody I would get along with,” Stump said.
The girl, Stump would soon find out, was 15-year-old Sophie Rose, a singer/songwriter who had recently signed with famous producer Dr. Luke, who has worked with artists such as Katy Perry, Avril Lavigne and P!nk.
Several months later, in December 2014, Stump attended Rose’s birthday party where she had the opportunity to meet several big names in the industry; among these was Grammy-winning producer Mikal Blue, who, along with working on Rose’s EP, has worked with artists such as Colbie Caillat, OneRepublic and Jason Mraz. Blue heard Stump play one of her original songs, “Treasure Map,” at the party, and asked for her contact information.
“[Blue] and I started talking, and I sent him more of my songs, and he was just really impressed with what I did,” Stump said. “He said he wanted to produce a record for me, and I was like, ‘Yes, absolutely.’”
It was then that they started work on Stump’s newest EP, Feels Like Home.
Stump had been writing songs for the record since March 2014. The following January she and Blue began pre-production, and that March they began recording.
“[Blue] pushed me to have a lot of production ideas and tell him what I wanted,” Stump said. “I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in that area of my music.”
One such instance occurred when she asked Blue if he had any ideas for the percussion in one of her songs.
“He was like, ‘Oh, I have the perfect instrument,’ and he [brought] it out and [told me to] play it,’” she said. “I was like, ‘I’m not a drummer, I don’t play.’ [But,] I tried it and I just fell in love with that thing. I never would have thought to put myself in that position.”
In addition to learning more about production, Stump, who had previously considered herself a folk/pop artist, said she found herself opening up to different styles of music.
“[My trip] to Nashville last summer really influenced my writing,” she said. “There was a lot of inspiration everywhere, and I wrote two of the songs that are on my EP during that trip.”
One of these songs, “Sweeter,” showcases this inspiration.
“I never really branded myself before as a country artist,” Stump said. “I still really don’t, but [“Sweeter”] just has that [country] sense, and that’s going to change things for me.”
Stump’s EP contains five songs: “Treasure Map,” “Stutter,” “Sweeter,” “It’s Alright” and “Minnesota.”
“Treasure Map,” the first single of the album, was co-written with Jason Afable in Nashville in 2014. Stump was inspired to write it after having traveled extensively that summer.
“Every time I got on a plane, I would look out the window and just try to imagine my life in that city,” she said. “[But] every time I left, I would think, ‘You know, I don’t know if this is it.’ [What I realized] was that I was really more drawn to the people that I have in my life [rather] than where I geographically am.”
Stump entered the writing session with Afable with this feeling of traveling and never feeling settled. What was special about this instance, she said, was that she began the writing process with no concrete ideas.
“I was [explaining my feelings] and Jason was looking through his notebook, and he was like, ‘Well, I’ve had this title in my notebook forever, and I don’t know what to do with it. It’s called “Treasure Map,” and that sounds like the perfect fit for what you’re going through,’” Stump said.
Having agreed on the title, the two artists finished the song within a few hours.
“Treasure Map,” along with the rest of the songs on the EP, is special because it accurately represents Stump as both an artist and a person, she said.
“I [think] there [is] a lot more truth in this record than there has been in the past,” Stump said. “A lot of it came really directly from my heart, which is something I was not necessarily the best at in my last album.”
Stump’s efforts to channel herself into her work paid off: She and her EP, which was initially released on Sept. 18, were recently featured on KCAL 9 and E! News.
“[The interview] at KCAL was just very eye-opening,” she said. “It was different from anything I’ve ever done. I’m just very, very lucky and very thankful.”
Stump plans to promote her EP to USC students at Tommy’s Place on Thursday, Oct. 15. She will be performing with artists Drew Tabor and Trousdale.

Schools out! · The RECESS Music and Ideas Festival took place on Wednesday with several organizations tabling on Trousdale Parkway. – Anastasia Velicescu | Daily Trojan
RECESS Music and Ideas Festival came to USC on Wednesday as part of its national tour of 10 college campuses. The festival, which took place on Trousdale Parkway sought to inspire students to innovate and create their own startups.
“Startup culture is really at a high right now, and college campuses have always been known as the epicenters for some of the biggest innovations of our time,” said Adam Ornelas, marketing manager for RECESS.
RECESS originally began in 2010 as a music festival touring college campuses. After cofounders Deuce Thevenow and Jack Shannon noticed how many students were passionate about entrepreneurship, they relaunched the festival in 2013 as a way to entertain and educate students at the same time.
“We hope that it can hopefully raise the awareness of entrepreneurship and reach students that maybe hadn’t thought about it or hadn’t been attracted to it,” said Jack Shannon, cofounder of RECESS. “The whole goal is to give them the opportunity to get in front of real investors, mentors or advisors.”
The event took place in three parts over the course of the day. The Playground, which took place on Trousdale Parkway starting at 10 a.m., gave students the opportunity to network with companies, including Lyft and L’Oreal.
Genesis Casco, a junior majoring in biochemistry, said the fair changed her ideas about the social impact that business can have.
“If I were to ever start a company, I would love to give back. Not just to be getting money but to be giving it back to other people who need help,” Casco said.

The fair also gave companies a way to identify students interested in developing new ideas.
“We have been wanting to find a good way to talk to students at USC who are of the entrepreneurial mindset, and RECESS is the perfect venue for that,” Erik Nielsen, cofounder of 2Truths and a Lie, said. “It’s kind of a mini-TED Talks for college campuses.”
In the evening, in the Annenberg West lobby, the speaker series “Office Hours” hosted a talk about fame on Vine with Vine influencer King Bach and a discussion on kickstarting a digital career with digital influencer Claudia Sulewski and L’Oreal Paris Senior Digital Marketing Manager Thomas Ahn. The panels were moderated by CNET Senior Editor Ashley Esqueda and CEO of Career Sushi, Shara Senderoff.
Ahn spoke about why he wanted to talk with students about innovation and entrepreneurship.
“There’s a lot of opportunity to have a symbiotic learning relationship, where we can mentor [students] and teach them things, and they can also give us a fresh perspective and fresh thinking,” Ahn said.
The event culminated in a pitch competition, which provided a platform for five teams of students to present an idea for a startup to a panel of judges.
The winning team, KRAFT IT, consisted of Kyle Walden and Patrick Carmody,  both juniors majoring in business administration and pitched an idea for a device that would measure air pollution.
The team said they have participated in pitch competitions in the past, and were honored to receive the win on Wednesday.
KRAFT IT will advance to the RECESS Field Trip where they will compete against winning teams from other colleges for the chance to start a company based on their idea.

Koru Inc., a job-finding company, is launching a new online job finding platform for college students and graduates. The job finder works to bridge the gap between employers and potential employees by creating a platform where job seekers can showcase their abilities. This service connects college students and graduates with coaches who polish resumes and applications and then make connections with employers.
“In today’s race for high-performing talent, many employers are looking for more than a resume,” cofounder and CEO Kristen Hamilton said. “Our new job finder helps grads present their best authentic selves and get noticed.”
Hamilton and cofounder Josh Jarrett saw a need for a platform like Koru due to the need for connection between potential employees and major companies. According to Koru Marketing Vice President Christina Mautz, 53 percent of recent college grads are either unemployed or underemployed. Meanwhile, Koru received feedback from major companies that were struggling to find the college graduates qualified for hiring.
“We were hearing this need from both sides, from the employers and from these bright, well-educated students who were more than qualified to fill the jobs that these companies were offering,” Mautz said. “We saw that we just needed to find a way to make that connection that had been missing before.”
For the past two years, Koru has partnered with the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to promote business “boot camps” for students. These immersive sessions gave students a chance to improve hard and soft business skills, practice problem-solving by creating presentations to solve real-life business problems and meet with a coach to build a game plan for the future. Ten students participated in these boot camps, and six are now employed with businesses such as Zulily and LinkedIn.
USC graduate Vannessa Sanchez attended two different boot camps. One lasted for two weeks online and two weeks in person, and the other lasted for four weeks in person. The events — which Sanchez described as “very intense” — partnered with Yelp and LinkedIn and gave participants hands-on opportunities to approach marketing challenges, pitch marketing strategies and hone skills in design, presentations and networking. After partnering with LinkedIn during the second workshop she attended, the company hired Sanchez as a recruiting coordinator straight out of college.
“I’ve gained mentors that I never would have met before,” Sanchez said. “They advocate for you, but you’ve also proven that you’re worthy of that through the work you put out in [the workshop]. You use the skills that they give you, and that’s what makes you succeed.”
The new job finder program provides prospective workers with direct contact with the employers to whom they are applying. Koru users first take a test that sets them up with available jobs that best fit their strengths — or what Koru calls the “seven key areas.” The user then creates an application for those jobs, which goes beyond a simple resume. Koru provides a system for users to write briefly about their strengths and create a video, that showcases their personality.
The video feature is one that Mautz is proud of, saying that it communicates more to an employer than any resume or application can. She also emphasized the helpfulness of the coaching services provided by Koru, which give direct feedback on how users can improve resumes, writing sections and videos in order to appeal more to employers.
Koru provides connections to employers in nine main categories, mostly in the marketing and business fields. While the program helps job seekers improve their applications, it also provides a direct connection to companies that have agreed to partner with Koru. These companies provide job listings, which Koru makes available to users whose interests and strengths match up with the available jobs.
“Our goal is to get graduates into real jobs, jobs that can turn into future careers,” Mautz said. “We focus on their strengths, and that helps them to successfully match with a job that they can truly excel in.”
The company beta tested the new job finder service last spring with a select group of users. Taylor Denton, a pilot user who graduated from Seattle University in 2015, applied to work at pet insurance company Trupanion and wasn’t asked to interview. She applied again through Koru, supplementing an improved resume with her video and writing sections. This time, she landed the job.
“My resume didn’t say enough about what I could really do,” Denton said. “Koru’s job finder was so different. I could really show off what I was capable of. Employers could get to know me versus what I looked like on a piece of paper.”
As Mautz points out, this system of connecting employers directly to college students and graduates is new for the companies as well. But with an increasing need for college graduates to stand out while applying — and an equal need from the companies looking to hire them — she believes that Koru will excel in guiding graduates into successful careers.
“So many companies say that they just can’t tell the difference between one resume and another,” Mautz said. “Koru takes the guessing out of that. We let graduates showcase who they are, and that’s what makes us — and our users — so successful.”

Hitting a milestone · During her career, senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio has been a part of 93 of head coach Mick Haley’s 899 NCAA Division I women’s volleyball victories. He seeks to become just the third to reach 900. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The undefeated women’s volleyball team returns home on Friday looking to notch the 900th win of the Mick Haley era. Both Arizona programs in the Pac-12 will visit the Galen Center this weekend: the No. 10 Arizona State Sun Devils come first on Friday night and the No. 14 Wildcats will look to knock off the No. 1 Women of Troy on Sunday.
In his 15th year in charge, head coach Mick Haley is aware of his upcoming milestone, but he said he is not interested in dwelling on it.
“I honestly don’t keep track of this stuff, and I think it’s useless to think about what you’ve done,” Haley said. “We start every week 0-0.”
For the second week in a row, Haley’s undefeated squad finds itself atop the national rankings. With an 18-0 record, the Women of Troy are one of just two unbeaten teams remaining in the nation, the other being No. 9 Kansas, but they are coming off a tough road trip to Colorado and Utah, where the Buffaloes pushed them to five sets in Boulder.
“The road trip was four long days,” Haley said, “[But] if you get wins … on the road in this conference, you’ve done something really special.”
After such a demanding travel schedule last week, the team was excited to be back playing at the Galen Center.
“We play here, we practice here, we basically spend all of our time here,” senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms said. “We know how the ball moves, and we’re definitely really comfortable at home.”
The Women of Troy will first take on Arizona State. The Sun Devils got off to a flying start to the season, but they lost their first two games last week during their visits to Washington and Washington State. Despite the losses, ASU remained in the top 10 this week with a 15-2 record.
USC last faced off against Arizona State early last season, when the Sun Devils came to the Galen Center and beat the Women of Troy, 1-3. The loss dropped USC out of the top 10, and the team finished the season unranked. This year, the much-improved Women of Troy are determined to grab a win.
“The biggest thing for us is to stay in rhythm and run our system,” Ogoms said. “It’s harder to run your system when you’re on the road, so now we want to get back to doing what made us successful at home.”
Arizona State comes to the Galen Center reeling. During the first of their back-to-back losses in Washington, the Sun Devils lost senior outside hitter Macey Gardner for the rest of the season to a torn ACL, and ASU will undoubtedly miss the program’s all-time kills leader on Friday.
Pac-12 volleyball analyst Holly McPeak shared her thoughts about filling the void for the Sun Devils, who have dropped consecutive sets since Gardner’s injury.
“[ASU will] have to figure out how to put the pieces of the puzzle together without Macey,” McPeak said.
Haley passed along his best wishes to Gardner, having coached her during a trip to China, but he emphasized that ASU is still a formidable opponent.
“I’ve ranked them top two in the country all year,” he said. “They have a good coach in Jason Watson, and he knows how to rally his team, so I’m sure they’ll be ready come Friday.”
After what will undoubtedly be a stiff test against the Sun Devils, USC will take on Arizona. The Wildcats began their season with eight wins on the trot, but they have gone 5-5 since. Their last match was a 3-2 win versus Washington State, but Arizona will have to face off against UCLA in Westwood before taking on the Women of Troy.
Last season, USC traveled to Tucson and clinched NCAA tournament eligibility with a 3-1 victory over the Wildcats.
Arizona leads the conference in defense, but McPeak pointed out that the Wildcats’ main goal will not be to stop senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio, but to try and slow her down.
“No one will ever shut her down,” McPeak said.
As each game goes by, Haley says the team is also preparing and practicing for the long haul.
“It sounds funny, but you play September, October and November to get ready for December,” he said. “We want to be 6-0 in December [at the NCAA tournament]. That’s the name of the game.”
Friday’s match against Arizona State kicks off at 8:00 p.m., and Arizona will play in the Galen Center at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday. Both games will be broadcasted on the Pac-12 Network.

Ohio State. Alabama. Florida State. They all have one thing in common: It’s almost impossible to beat them at their home stadiums. In fact, these teams are a combined 72-3 at home since the 2012 season.
The fact that these teams are so dominant at home should come as no surprise. Over the past four years, Ohio State, Alabama and Florida State have been some of the most consistent teams. In fact, these three teams are the past three NCAA champions.
USC used to be this dominant at home. Teams hated to make the trek to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. However, times have changed.
Last Thursday, the Trojans dropped their second consecutive home game, a feat that hasn’t happened since 2001 — Pete Carroll’s first year in charge.  In fact, since Carroll’s departure after the 2009 season, the Trojans have struggled mightily at home.
During Carroll’s nine-year tenure from 2001-09, the Trojans lost a combined five home games. As noted above, two of those came in his first year as head coach and another two came during his last season in 2009. The only other loss was a 24-23 stunner to Jim Harbaugh’s Stanford in 2007.
To put it straight, the Trojans were basically invincible at home from 2002-08 going 41-1 and at one point having an impressive 32 home game winning streak. The Coliseum was the holy grail of stadiums. The crowd, the media and the players all knew the Trojans were going to win every home game.
Everything changed after the 2008 season. In 2009, the Stanford Cardinal handed the Trojans their worst home defeat in ages — a whopping 55-21 loss. You have to go back to 1966 when the Fighting Irish shut out the Trojans 51-0 at the Coliseum.
The aura of the Coliseum faded after that Stanford game and seemingly never recovered. After only suffering five home defeats during the Carroll era, the Trojans have lost five games in the past three years, and 11 games since Carroll bolted for the NFL in 2009.
Under Kiffin and Sarkisian, the Trojans lost six games against unranked opponents and boast only one win over a top 10 ranked team — 2013 against No. 4 Stanford. Even more insinuating is the fact that the Trojans only have one home win each over UCLA and Notre Dame since Carroll’s departure.
The Coliseum is simply no longer feared.
Teams like Washington State, Arizona State and Washington would have never dreamed of  beating USC at home before. Most of this is a result of the coaching. Kiffin and Sarkisian were sub-par head coaches at best, but some of the blame falls on the shoulders of the fans as well.
Growing up, I had the privilege of watching the Trojans during their impressive 32 home game winning  streak. Every time I went to the Coliseum, the stadium would be rocking. Oftentimes, it was so loud you could barely hold a conversation with the person next to you if you weren’t screaming.
Last Thursday, the attendance at the Coliseum was pathetic.
I remember gazing around the Coliseum and thinking to myself, “Wow, I haven’t seen this place so quiet in years.”
The Coliseum was half empty, the student section didn’t fill up until mid-way through the second quarter and the only time there was life was when the Trojans needed a stop late in the fourth quarter.
As fans, we have to do better. Ohio State consistently ranks in the top three of attendance with an average of 105,000 fans per game. The Trojans, who have one of the largest seating capacities at 90,000, have had an average attendance of just 73,000 over the past five years.
Heck, even Michigan, who went 5-7 last season, had an average attendance of 104,000 people. Sure the stadium holds 109,900, but almost selling out every game when your team is that awful is pretty impressive.
The Coliseum can get back to its glory days, but it starts with the fans. Every game during the Carroll era was basically a sell out. The Trojans haven’t sniffed anywhere near 90,000 fans since 2008.
The Trojans will reach greatness again, but I think it has to start with winning home games. Losses to 17-point under dogs at home can’t be tolerated any longer.
The Coliseum needs to be feared once again.

All smiles · Interim head coach Clay Helton believes his team has responded to adversity well on the practice field this week. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
The way this year’s USC team is rallying around Clay Helton draws comparisons to the 2013 season, when players, including quarterback Cody Kessler, came together for a 6-2 finish to the regular season under then-interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
“Obviously, I know him better than anybody on this team, and I really respect him and guys really do respect him because you know that he’s excited,” said Kessler about his long-time position coach. “He knows it is going to be tough ahead of him, but he doesn’t want to put too much pressure on us. He told us, ‘Hey this is just us playing football.’ We’re going to stick to what we know.”
Helton and Kessler have established a special relationship in their time together. Helton called plays for USC when he served as the interim coach for the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl against Fresno State, a game the Trojans won, 45-20. Helton says that he’s been coaching Kessler for seven years now — two years recruiting him and five years as a player.
According to Helton, the connection they’ve established allows him to rely on Kessler as a coach on the field because he understands exactly what the offensive coaches want when calling plays.
Consequently, Helton isn’t concerned about how the fifth- year senior will respond to arguably his worst performance at USC against Washington, in which Kessler struggled all night and threw two interceptions. Helton said Thursday’s game was merely an an off day for Kessler.
“The great thing for him is he is a tremendous competitor and student of the game, and I don’t anticipate that happening to him again,” Helton said.  “The first thing he told me after the game was, ‘Don’t worry about me.’ I said, ‘Buddy, I believe it, I’ve been with you for a long time.”
Helton, who has been calling plays for the Trojans all season, says that he will continue to do so until the end of it. Helton has spent six years at USC as the quarterbacks coach.
He added the passing game coordinator role in 2012 and became the offensive coordinator in 2013. Helton says that the fortified relationship he’s built with this offensive coaching staff will give him the time he’ll need to focus on the defense and special teams.
Replacing Helton as quarterbacks coach will be Marques Tuiasosopo, a former quarterback who was previously on staff as the team’s tight ends coach.
“I think that as a head coach that the whole team has to feel you at every position, and I want to make sure that I am part of that defensive structure, because they have to know that you care,” Helton said. “They have to know that you have their best interest in heart, and they have got to feel your passion for them.”
Helton said that the incredible support he’s received in his second practice as head coach is a result of the spirit of the the Trojan Family. And last night, after Helton organized a team BBQ for players, coaches and family members to watch the new ESPN documentary “Trojan War,” he said he realized how much this opportunity means to him.
“[When] we’re all there together and there’s a 30 for 30 on TV there, you really see how powerful ’SC is and the brand of ’SC and how special this place is,” Helton said. “There is no other place like it in the world and you got to see how success was made, and for them it was right on this practice field.”
Sophomore Adoree’ Jackson shared about how the 30 for 30 had good timing, but the team will always be motivated for the rivalry game. He talked about how the team possesses the confidence to go and perform on Saturday.
“We’re just ready to go out there and play,” Jackson said.
Helton and his players have repeatedly emphasized that the best way to get through this turmoil is by playing football. Though the sensitivities of Sarkisian’s firing have shocked many, veterans like Kessler say that the team is in remarkably good spirits.
Kessler, junior Su’a Cravens and redshirt senior Tre Madden  have been visibly more vocal in recent practices, acting as mentors to their teammates during this hard time.
“I’ve been through adversity and the same exact situation,” Kessler said. “I know how to handle it, it’s the young guys I have to be there for. I need to teach them how you handle things that you can’t control. We had no control over what happened, but we do have control over how we play Saturday and how we play going on with the season.”
Helton called his team’s situation a “fresh start.” To prepare for the noise against Notre Dame in South Bend, Helton had a cart with huge speakers on it that played thundering crowd sounds that drove closely behind the offenses’ scrimmage as they marched down the practice field.
“We want it to be a game-like atmosphere,” Helton said. “So it’s easy on Saturdays.”
The team practiced silent counts and hand gestures to combat the noise.
Even with all of the distractions that go beyond football on the field, it hasn’t been forgoten that it’s rivalry week.
“It’s special,” Helton said. “It’s USC vs. Notre Dame, and that is going to provide a little bit of extra juice and I think they  want to go out and prove something. They want to make the Trojan Family proud and from what I’ve seen on the field these past two days, I’ve been extremely impressed with the group of professionals on the field.”
Madden did little work for the second straight day because of his tender knee, though Helton sounded optimistic that Madden will be able to play Saturday. He added that injured players Steven Mitchell and Darreus Rogers will also probably play, but will be evaluated day-to-day.
In the face of the adversity, the momentum felt by the players and coaches as they turn their focus back to football will prove to be an important element if the Trojans are going to be able to go the road and upset the Fighting Irish.
Kessler feels confident in his team’s abilities as they head out to South Bend. He believes even in the face of everything that has happened, the team can still rally together.
“These guys have a chance to do something great this year,” Kessler said.
Former head coach Steve Sarkisian broke his silence on Wednesday via Twitter, making public comments for the first time since he was terminated.
“I would like to thank everyone for their huge outpouring of support and well wishes,” Sarkisian tweeted.” “This is a very difficult time for my family and me. I am facing these challenges the best I can and your support helps immensely.”

Melbourne is not only a tour stop frequented by big names like Kendrick Lamar, Neil Diamond,  Sam Smith and Kanye West, but also a hub for  musical talent. Famous musicians, including Jet, Olivia Newton-John and The Temper Trap, have their roots in this city.
Music plays a large role in Melbourne culture, particularly with the younger crowd. Music influences the Melbourne lifestyle, as many people revel in the night. Though venues determine where people frequent, the main attraction of Melbourne nightclubs is still the music. Minimalist techno captures the essence of modern Melbourne electronic music. It’s exciting to feel the walls of the clubs reverberate along with the music, with lighting and sound construction incorporated into the experience.
Even the smallest inflections in music can draw variant crowds. As I had previously never encountered the electronic music genre before, I have difficulty distinguishing between the beats. But, throughout my stay here, I have learned that the city is truly a haven for fans of new wave electronic music, as it inspires people to plaster glow-in-the-dark paint over themselves, wear punk clothing or adopt dress codes to create commonality in experiencing the music. Adding to Melbourne’s musical appeal draws from Australia’s growing presence in the global scene, with artists such as Flume debuting in Sydney. Flight Facilities, Will Sparks and Karpe Diem are some known Aussie DJs that are gaining traction globally.
The music inspires Melbourne’s famed dance, the Melbourne Shuffle. One of my goals before I leave is to master this iconic dance move of the ’80s music scene. The Melbourne Shuffle involves full body movement synched to music and is individualized based on the person. I have encountered several variations, as people include lights and incorporate other moves in their take.
The streets, however, are also home to aspiring musicians. The city boasts an active street culture that makes everyday life more vibrant. Simultaneously, however, the State of Victoria is rather protective in discerning what type of expression are admissible, with safety  the largest concern. Buskers — people who engage in a variety of activities including singing, miming and dancing — are licensed entertainers who can perform in the general area. Buskers include those who draw on pavement or paper in the public.
Even with a license that lasts for three months to a year, buskers still have to plan when and where specifically they will hold a performance in coordination with other buskers to avoid overlapping. The Bourke Street Mall, a heavy foot traffic street in the Central Business District, is reserved for only professional buskers. To acquire this license, buskers must demonstrate that they can perform for 30 minutes straight without repeating material and that their main source of income is from busking. They also must perform and audition for their talent to be reviewed.
One day while walking through the streets, I stumbled upon a melody quite unlike anything I had previously encountered. A female musician, Tash Sultana, stood in the center, mixing tracks with beatboxing she recorded on the spot, strumming her guitar and captivating the audience with her voice. Soon a traffic jam started as onlookers crowded around Sultana — her guitar case was quickly overflowed with notes and change. When I immediately followed her on Instagram, I felt as though I was part of the traction that would lead to her rise to fame.
Buskers come in all different varieties, as the street provides a venue for musical experimentation. Street performers take their turns busking and performing in venues, but it was surprising for me to learn that the talent pool is competitive. Performers rely on social media to share performance times and locations, as well as new material. It is exciting to be part of the experience of artist discovery, though sometimes parts of the streets would be better if they remained quiet.
Music festivals and warehouse parties also play a huge role in the music culture of the city. With over five music festivals a month in Victoria culminating in even larger ones that occur in the spring and summer, there is no shortage of opportunity to have a day of live music. In November, the City of Melbourne hosts an eight-day festival, Melbourne Music Week, that celebrates Melbourne’s distinct musical presence. The event hosts over 240 local and international artists performing a range of music including rock, pop, folk, electronic and more in venues, streets, laneways and cafes.
Before arriving in Melbourne, my music palette was limited. The city has expanded my curiosity, created an appetite for exploration and compelled me to stop in the street many a time to listen to the buskers.

Following a four-year hiatus since Era Extraña, Alan Palomo, better known as Neon Indian, has kept avid listeners eager and ready for the follow-up to his ambitious 2011 album. Neon Indian’s upcoming release, VEGA INTL. Night School, showcases an evolution of the same kind of sound and experimentation that made his previous albums mesmerizing. The album offers a slight departure from his previous sound, drifting into an impeccable fusion of rhythmic exploration and expression. Interesting to note about VEGA INTL. Night School is the fact that it was recorded over the course of four years. In addition to providing listeners with a
one-of-a-kind disco-tech album, Palomo brings to attention a work ethic focused around intricacy — an energy that more musical artists should follow.
After opening with the intriguing “Hit Parade,” the album continues onto its first single, “Annie.” Though it is not the most interesting song the album offers, “Annie” appropriately sets up the unconditional energy that is consistent throughout the entire album. With “Annie, don’t run away / Where I can’t find you / The game has gone too far,” Palomo tells a story about a protagonist who is distraught, desperate and torn over the lack of closure between her and a former lover. Though one can easily grasp the context of the song by simply listening to the lyrics, Palomo’s voice delivers his disparity. Do not, however, mistake this for a gloomy sound. Most significant about “Annie” is the contrast between the unhappy lyrics and the feel-good sound evoked by the funky beat and danceable rhythm. Though the guitar riff may not be the most digestible sound on the track, “Annie” includes a mesmerizing breakdown in which Palomo demonstrates his ability to take control of two distinct sounds by merging them masterfully. The song’s guitar line complements a light disco beat that constantly demands attention. “Annie” sets up an animated listening experience that is further explored.
Amid a collection of spunk and attitude, some of the tracks stand significantly  on their own. Take for example, one of the highlights of the album, “Slumlord.” As VEGA INTL. Night School’s most recent single from the album, “Slumlord” rightfully represents such a vibrant album. The track begins as a collection of several synths, illustrating a celestial, cosmic portrait that should belong in a science fiction film. The song generates a massive amount of energy, and that’s just before Palomo’s voice joins the retro-futuristic groove. Palomo’s animated voice provides another highlight to the song, making for a captivating chorus. The intonation of his vocals, when layered over a hypnotic whirl of pop-perfection, is when Neon Indian’s brilliance really shines. The track continues onto a breakdown, transporting audiences to a massive celebratory frenzy. This song abounds in Palomo’s signature synths, reminiscent of ’80s dance music.  Whether it’s one song or another, VEGA INTL. Night School demonstrates the power of a carefully designed production.
A significant quality about each of the songs on this album is how a single sound develops in the span of under five minutes. The unpredictable structure of these songs make for an exciting, engaging and creative experience. Most of the songs feel distinct enough from one another. However, they all contribute to the feel-good atmosphere of the album that leaves one feeling on top of the world.
One of the most striking aspects of VEGA INTL. Night School is how Palomo manages to vocally express himself so well that audiences do not necessarily need to know his lyrics to understand how he feels. Such vocals are significant enough to add a touch of life to the already irresistible tracks, but they don’t direct attention away from the soul of the music: the instrumentals. Palomo does, however, assure listeners that his voice is perfectly suited for pop.
Though the album allows plenty of opportunities to showcase talent, other aspects of the album do not feel as polished. Palomo’s voice, as lovely as it is, is often difficult to hear under the heavy beats, making it impossible to know his lyrics. That being said, these songs do not fall flat; instead, Palomo’s light and expressive voice is shown to be as versatile as his collection of instrumentals, which range from funk-guitar lines to sounds suited for an island getaway.
As lively as tracks such as “Bozo,” “Dear Skorpio Magazine” and “Street Level” are, the album loses adrenaline as it approaches the final song, indicating that perhaps the album is one or two songs too long. In addition to potentially feeling overwhelming by the end, the album’s energy dies down with the placement of “61 Cygni Ave.” The track is surrounded by such magnificent pieces, which makes it feel insignificant as the penultimate song on the album. Nevertheless, the first half of the album was put together very beautifully, with the songs transitioning seamlessly.
VEGA INTL. Night School makes for an experience that is as appealing to the ears as it is to the mind. There are many moments throughout the album in which the production is both top-notch and unique to Neon Indian. “Street Level,”  for example, is a gem that fuses hip-hop and funk, creating a one-of-a-kind sound suited for the album. Whether it’s that, the prominent drums in “Slumlord” or the break down in “Dear Skorpio Magazine,” Palomo constantly shows how to take control of multiple sounds that may not necessarily be immediately related. VEGA INTL. Night School can best be summed up as a collection of various sounds that effortlessly represent Neon Indian’s creativity at its most passionate. If it takes four years to make an album that is as close to pop perfection as VEGA INTL. Night School is, then more artists should allow their creative clocks to tick.
VEGA INTL. Night School will be released on Oct. 16 by Mom+Pop Music.

Director Lenny Abrahamson’s portrayal of Emma Donoghue’s bestselling novel, Room, is mesmerizing. Starring Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room follows a mother and son’s harrowing escape. Jack (Tremblay) narrates the story of his mother, Joy (Larson), whom he calls “Ma.”  The mother-son duo live in a
10-by-10 foot space, which Jack calls “Room.” Having lived in Room his whole life, Jack is unaware of the world that exists outside of it. However, after turning five years old, everything starts to change. Ma tells him the truth about the outside world, and they begin to create a plan for escape. Even scarier than the idea of staying in Room is the world outside of it. Jack and Joy’s greatest challenges find them on the other side of Room’s four walls.
Larson’s performance is haunting and has topped multiple Oscar prediction lists. Her depiction of Joy’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities puts the audience in her shoes as she shines in portraying a woman in suffering. Larson portrays a heroic mother, sacrificing her mental well-being in order to protect the innocence of her son. Joy’s ultimate purpose in life is to protect Jack, often forcing her to be untruthful to him. By keeping the truth about Room from Jack until he reaches the age of five, Joy provides him with a happy childhood he would not have experienced had he known the truth about their living situation. Upon discovering the truth about the outside world, Jack reacts with disbelief, followed by anger. He does not want to believe that there is more to life than what his mother had told him all his life. However, the precocious Jack quickly comes around after he realizes his mother may have been telling him the truth. Larson movingly depicts Joy’s spiral into depression after her only ally does not believe her. The tiredness in her eyes shows the look of a woman who no longer has a desire to live.The sheer misery she encounters on a daily basis followed by the occasional glimpses of hope she faces are bound to have audiences leaving the theater in tears. Ultimately, Larson does a stunning job of portraying a woman in such a difficult and draining position.
Similarly, Tremblay’s representation of Jack is equally heartbreaking as he succeeds in portraying the lively innocence that thrives in children even in the most dreadful situations. Jack’s curiosity and eagerness for life is strikingly distant from his mother’s tired and somber disposition. Just like a real five year old, Jack throws tantrums at the worst possible times and is often angry at things he does not understand. Tremblay’s narrations are chilling, as they reflect the innocence of a five year old blissfully unaware of the fact that he is placed in a grievous situation.
Room does an excellent job of following the original novel’s storyline. Some of Jack’s narrations come straight from the book and add a haunting tone to the movie as they reflect his childlike nature while overlaying some of the most depressing parts of the movie. Additionally, the cinematography does a fine job of portraying the world from Jack’s perspective, portraying his vision of Room as a much nicer place than it is in reality. However, the images and sounds from the scenes where Jack sleeps in his wardrobe are particularly difficult to watch, as Jack’s innocence is greatly endangered. As Jack counts the seconds that pass, time seems to slow down, forcing the viewer to fully engulf everything that is happening.
Abrahamson has succeeded in making an incredible film about human resilience. Though the main storyline of Room is rather heavy, Abrahamson strongly contrasts the worst aspects of the story by allowing Jack’s character to flourish. Throughout the movie, Jack is never fully aware of the real reason he and his mother lived in Room so, to him, the story is more about his personal growth and discovery of the outside world. His thirst for learning and curiosity about life add a heartwarming spark to an otherwise gut-wrenching movie. The contrast between Jack’s positive outlook and his mother’s cynical perspective creates a perfect balance that is maintained throughout the film even after their escape from the confines of Room. This movie effortlessly follows a storyline rarely explored in film due to dark undertones. However, despite its these  undertones, Room somehow upholds a fairly bright outlook due to Jack’s chillingly pleasant narrations. Room is a masterful movie that surely will not disappoint.

It is no secret that admission to top universities like the University of California, Berkeley and USC is largely tied to socioeconomic status. Though this is not the only factor that leads to admission success, the college admissions process is undeniably slanted toward those with favorable financial resources. Thus, universities, particularly those aimed to increase access, should not ignore the ability of the affluent to better adapt to and cope with the university admissions system. For this reason, UC Berkeley’s recent decision to allow letters of recommendation further sinks its own admissions system in the sea of institutional dysfunction in which it and other universities have been collectively drowning. At best, this decision is disappointing. It is not a step in the right direction, nor is it really even a step backward — it is a step nowhere.
Aside from being essentially useless, UC Berkeley’s new policy presents a larger issue — it increases the bias the modern admissions system already maintains toward the financially privileged. In districts starved of funding, underpaid teachers are frequently less engaged with the student body than their counterparts in more affluent areas. Thus, students in underfunded public school systems must then attempt to attain a letter of recommendation from a group of teachers who do not form the same bonds or long-lasting connections as better supported faculty. Moreover, there are multiple working class communities — particularly in California — in which much of the student body speaks English as a second language. Forming these connections is much harder to accomplish while also simultaneously attempting to overcome a language barrier. The idea that a student could request a recommendation from a credible source assumes that the student is part of a community that allows them to showcase their skills to instructors in unique and individual ways. But for many working-class students, this is simply not the case. As a public school that outwardly strives to serve communities of all social classes, UC Berkeley’s new measure is a direct betrayal of the university’s professed values.
Moreover, adding a letter of recommendation worsens stress culture that has been suffocating American college applicants. Students are under extreme pressure to obey the demands of an antiquated process that requires a perfect command of the finesses of time management, taxing energy expenditure and unhealthy social and physical habits. This stress becomes augmented when the student also must be expected to overcome excessive barriers, such as attaining a letter of recommendation.
The fact that Berkeley is going to now start “allowing” — a word many college applicants recognize as code for requiring — letters of recommendation highlights the introduction of one more asinine requirement into a broken system, a useless application tactic undeniably subject to the same biases and inherent issues as the rest. It does nothing to address existing problems.
There is no worthwhile information in a letter of recommendation, particularly at the high school level, that could possibly distinguish the superiority of one applicant from the next.  It will not allow the university to ascertain who is best outfitted to utilize available campus resources or take their degree to a higher plane of understanding and prestige — it is an empty statement of positive attributes, an obviously biased and partial opinion. At the elite level of applicants from which UC Berkeley is able to pick, differences between applicants are often trivial. As a result, admissions becomes horrifyingly random. A letter of recommendation will not fix this problem.
The system is still evolving out of a time when applicants were mostly naturalized in the English language, socioeconomically privileged and culturally Euro-American. The admissions process is rife with internal problems and obvious dysfunction. Thus, it is truly a disgrace when an institution as intelligent and forward-thinking as UC Berkeley could not conceive of a better solution to this ongoing problem. To allow letters of recommendation is a pitiful consolation prize that, if anything, proves a dangerous point — that even at the highest levels of prestige, universities haven’t a clue how to rehabilitate their admissions systems.

This month, we’ve seen a string of incidents on college campuses related to greek life that have sparked controversy. Recently, a UCLA fraternity hosted a “Kanye Western” themed party that featured students wearing blackface and dressed to imitate Kanye West’s wife, reality star Kim Kardashian. Late last month, Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath experienced racism when a fraternity member hurled a drink at her and used some choice words.
These instances aren’t novel to greek life. Time and time again, reports of inappropriate and dangerous scenarios from greek life events, houses and parties surface. They aren’t isolated incidents, nor anomalies.
In today’s world — one more aware of and privy to moral and social justice in the public sphere — we must reevaluate whether greek life has a place on college campuses at all. More importantly, recent incidents have called into question the consistency of the principles and philosophy of Greek life with a positive impact on students and the community. Rather, its actions and history of violence, discrimination, sexual assault and racism may have become morally hazardous and detrimental to the development of young students, universities and our communities.
In the last two years alone at USC, we’ve seen a string of events that have been cause for concern. From a partygoer falling from a table, to a number of reported cases of sexual assault and rape, to frequent anecdotes from current and former fraternity and sorority members, the Row and greek life have posed more of a threat to safety and campus welfare than any other extracurricular or bonding experience. Horrific stories of hazing and bullying also grab headlines and illustrate an institution fraught with antiquated practices and worn-out beliefs.
Fraternities and sororities are ostensibly structured to develop young men and women as leaders through community events and engagement. What was once a constructive activity has turned into breeding ground of alcohol and drug abuse, sexual violence that puts individuals in danger, and egregious acts of racism and discrimination. Transports on the Row don’t have to be a rite of passage. Young women shouldn’t have to worry that they may be taken advantage of at a fraternity party. Cases of rape shouldn’t have to be swept under the rug in fear of social backlash. Freshmen shouldn’t have to be hazed in order to be initiated. New members shouldn’t have to be of a certain race or social status in order to be accepted.
What greek life has transformed into is a divisive machine that no longer meets the goals it set out to achieve. The byproduct of its actions has fostered a culture that turns a blind eye to rape and sexual assault, and one that is resigned to apathy in the face of racism and discrimination. Greek life seems to have lost its aim and has become a spectacle that threatens moral standing and has no regard for social expectations.
Some may argue that Sampath could have easily experienced racism outside the Row or that the UCLA party was blown out of proportion or not representative of all parties. What both events demonstrate is a microcosm of what’s actually happening at these parties and in greek life. We shouldn’t wait for yet another story of a disturbing party, reported rape or hazing incident to realize the culture of greek life has become a problem that needs to be addressed.
As a leading research university, USC is not only a model for the community, but also has the capacity to change the national narrative in terms of fraternity life. An honest discussion must take place about greek  life’s role and place on college campuses and its tangible impact on university culture and actions.
I’m not saying greek life should be outright banned, but it’s necessary to now take a step back and ascertain what greek life is doing and how it’s shaping campus life.
Athanasius Georgy is a junior majoring in economics. His column, “Campus Talk,” runs  Thursdays.
there are plenty of valid reasons to question fraternities, but citing the UCLA incident with “blackface” just weakens your point.
there is no evidence that anyone actually wore blackface. some were dressed as “gold diggers” with charcoal on their face and pickaxes, and others had fake facial hair, but there was nothing even approaching minstrelsy-level racism.
This is the second opinion piece that has made this factually incorrect assertion.  I expect better from the Daily Trojan.

You slept through your alarm. You spilled your PSL down the front of your white tee. Your bike chain came loose. Your exam didn’t go so well. You’re overwhelmed by midterms. Your friends went home for the weekend and you’re feeling homesick. 
Though the name of this playlist is vague, I guarantee it will help. These aren’t so much songs for a bad day as they are songs for helping you acknowledge it’s been a bad day and helping you move on from there. It’s pretty heavy on the slow and steady, but by the time you get to “So American” and “Float On,” I promise it’ll be “Blue Skies” calling — and if I’m wrong, listen to Noah and the Whale’s “Blue Skies” on your own time.
There are good days and there are bad days. If this is one of the latter, take a long breath and hit play.

I have a confession to make: I’m a coffee addict. Granted, it’s not a scandalous confession, and all of my friends and even vague acquaintances know this about me, so how secret can it be? But for me, coffee is a food group. It’s what makes mornings bearable, and it’s what makes Monday mornings rank only second on my list of “Awful Things That Happen on a Regular Basis” (5,000-word essays take the prized spot of number one.) Like all obsessed hipster-wannabes, my Instagram account is littered with pictures of coffees I’ve bought across the world.

Becoming a college student has not slowed down my coffee consumption — it raised the addiction a couple (hundred) notches. Suddenly, 8:00 a.m. classes and pulling all-nighters to write the essay I procrastinated for two weeks were impossible without a Grande or two.

So, what happens when a coffee addict has to go (almost) a week without coffee? Mayhem, pain and general suffering, perhaps.
Day 1: Caffeine withdrawal is like that one family friend with fake nails who always pinches your cheeks really hard.
I chose to start this experiment on Tuesday because there was no way I was going to make it through Monday without caffeine in my system. I drank two extra coffees on Monday, which I think was a sort of goodbye before the hiatus. However, the extra caffeine was not my friend that night, and I could only manage about three hours of sleep.
Tuesday morning dawned bright and early with a mandatory online lab I was only half awake for. My first real class of the day was at 12:30 p.m., by which time I was already feeling the onset of a headache. Though I don’t normally have time for breakfast, I had a bowl of Cheerios that morning for a much needed jolt of energy. Spoiler alert: It didn’t work.

Day 2: Withdrawal sets in.
Wednesdays are generally light days in terms of workload. Today, however, I just could not focus in either of my classes. My head ached, and I wished it was acceptable to wear sunglasses indoors because the bright lights utilized in classrooms stabbed at my eyes. I felt spacey and slow, unable to keep up with conversation as my head pounded. After my last class, I dragged myself to my dorm room, washed down an Advil with water and tried to sleep off the withdrawal headache.

Day 3: There’s an unexpected silver lining.
Thursdays are brutal only because I have a four-hour shift that starts at 8 a.m. sharp, and involves ambushing people with a microphone to interview them for Annenberg Radio News. Normally, I’m a few minutes late to my shift because there’s a line at The Cafe, no matter the time. But since I couldn’t have any coffee, I gave the lined-up students waiting for their daily fix of caffeine a wistful look as I trudged to the media center. My student manager beamed at me when I signed in for my shift five minutes early, a first for me.

The caffeine withdrawal headache, though not as painful as yesterday, was still present. It hummed in the back of my head like a trigger-happy hornet’s nest, waiting for a loud sound or flash of sunlight to make its presence known.
Day 4: The last stretch is (finally) here!
Fridays, as a rule, are magical days. They signify the weekend, relaxation and fun. This particular Friday is more magical than most because with its end comes the end of my self-imposed coffee hiatus — suffering for my art has never been so literal.
Thankfully, the withdrawal headache is mild, even laughable compared to Wednesday. I feel almost like Wonder Woman as the day winds down, strong and happy. That’s not to say I don’t go back to drinking coffee the very next day — because, of course, without coffee … I can’t function.

Except you are not a coffee addict. If you were an addict, you would need to consume more and more coffee to produce the same physiological effects due to building up tolerance. Your bladder would have exploded by now.
No, rather than an addict, you are just someone with a poor ability to self-moderate who classifies themselves as an “addict” in a way that privileged white people like to seem relevant by sharing the great cross they must bear in society.
It’s a post about coffee…
