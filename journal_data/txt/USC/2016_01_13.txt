Movie lovers, we’ve finally made it: the dark and twisty films of fall have been released and now we’re moving into lighter, more fun content. While spring films normally have brighter content as a lead-in to a fantastic season of summer movies, there will still be some jam-packed action films coming our way in the next couple of months.
 
Kung Fu Panda 3 (Jan. 29)
The lovable panda Po (Jack Black) returns for a third time in the caring, adorable Kung Fu Panda series. This looks to serve as not only a family-fun movie but also one that college students can go and see with their friends when they want to be entertained. This time, Po reunites with his biological father and meets a group of pandas that he, shockingly, does not fit in with. How does he manage his way through this fiasco? Hilariously, of course.
 
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (Feb. 5)
Based on the parody novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith comes an action filled mashup of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice with zombie elements. Lily James and Sam Riley star as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, the two leads. The premise of the film looks to add modern feminist twists to the original story: a plague has befallen England, overrunning it with zombies, and Elizabeth is advanced at martial arts. While her sisters join her in the fight to restore England to solely human presence, she and Mr. Darcy must unite to save England — and, in the process, discover their love for one another. The concept might sound silly to those who stuck to reading Austen’s original work, but the execution looks fun.
 
Zoolander 2 (Feb. 12)
Fifteen years after the original Zoolander film was released to critical acclaim, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are back for another wild, high-fashion adventure. This time, the dynamic duo is recruited by Interpol to infiltrate an unknown section of fashion, which is causing assassinations in the modeling world. Watching Wilson and Stiller strut it out on the New York Fashion Week runway last spring was enough to get anyone excited for this long-awaited installment.
 
Zootopia (March 4)
Disney is taking another shot at an animal-animated cast film with Zootopia, where rabbit Judy Hoops (Ginnifer Goodwin) joins the Zootopia police force and attempts to find a missing officer. While this film is clearly kid-friendly, college students could definitely check this film out.
 
Divergent: Allegiant (March 18)
The incredibly successful Divergent film series is coming to an end, with the final installment Allegiant being split into two films. The second installment will be released in the summer of 2017. Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) have escaped from the wall that is holding Chicago hostage and isolating them from the world. The two both experience shock at what the real world is like once they return and struggle to find people they can trust. The trailer is exciting and looks to enhance the already popular film series.
 
Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (March 25)
It may be four years since Christian Bale hung up his cape as Gotham’s resident Dark Knight, but a new Batman is here. This film looks to serve as two things: one, an introduction of Ben Affleck as Batman, and two, a sequel to 2013’s Man of Steel. In short, Batman looks to confront Superman, and fighting ensues. The casting of Affleck caused controversy, and Man of Steel didn’t fare as well with critics as the creators had hoped. However, there’s still hope that this could turn out to be a really fun, action-packed film.
 
The Jungle Book (April 25)
Almost 50 years after the original animated Disney feature, The Jungle Book has returned with a 3D version. With a star-studded cast ranging from Ben Kingsley, Lupita Nyong’o, Christopher Walken and Scarlett Johansson, there is — hopefully — no one that this adorable movie can disappoint.
 
Captain America: Civil War (May 6)
The third installment of the recent Captain America films has received immense anticipation from fans and critics since its cross-film predecessor, Avengers: Age of Ultron. Both Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) are looking to protect the world from future enemies, but split off into two teams following government regulation and implementation. Circle this on your calendar as a go-to film to see when you need a break from studying for finals.
 
Alice: Through the Looking Glass (May 27)
The sequel to Tim Burton’s highly successful take on the fantastic Alice in Wonderland tale is back. Set a few years after the last film, Alice — played by an incredibly convincing Mia Wasikowska — returns to Underland and finds the Mad Hatter, played by Johnny Depp, has lost his Munchness and is in a funk. So Alice is sent on a fantastic mission by Queen Mirna, played by Anne Hathaway, in the hopes of restoring Hatter to his former glory.
 
X-Men: Apocalypse (May 27)
Serving as the ninth film the X-Men series, and a sequel to 2014’s X-Men: Days of Future Past, the mutants are coming back with a bang. Apocalypse, a monster who has been buried for thousands of years, is unearthed and crafts a team of mutants to help him create a new order. It’s up to the X-Men to stop this dastardly plan.

On an aimless browsing trip through Etsy, an online marketplace where people sell vintage or handmade items, I came across a peculiar listing. Interest piqued, I clicked on the link, “Riot Grrrl nostalgia zine grab bag.” The seller was advertising a collection of mismatched pro-feminism zines produced in the early 1990s. The covers were either pink or white with black and white pictures and typewriter text on the front. One was titled Chicklet, the other Devil Girl.
According to Barnard College, a zine is “a self-publication, motivated by the desire for self-expression, not for profit.” They’re usually made using a photocopier and stapled to look like a small magazine.
Considering people don’t usually create zines for profit, zines are probably the most honest medium used to spread information and ideology. That applies especially to feminist zines, which are often pro-choice and discuss sex and other inflammatory and controversial topics. Feminist is often referred to as the “f-word,” so it definitely takes courage to create a feminist zine.
Given the definition of zines, it’s no wonder why Riot Grrrl would use these publications for their own advancement. Riot Grrrl was an underground feminist movement that started in the late 1980s and continued to the mid-1990s. Nowadays, the movement is remembered mostly via the original Riot Grrrl band Bikini Kill’s music and the countless feminist zines the movement produced during that period of time.
Unable to resist, I purchased the grab bag and immediately fell in love when it arrived. Each zine was utterly unique. Each author personalized her zine to reflect her thoughts on feminism, equal rights, puberty, boys, politics and so much more. The pages were chock-full of one-off art and personal thoughts.
I soon realized that there were hundreds of listings on Etsy for feminist zines; only a few of the listings were for old zines from the ’90s. Zines haven’t disappeared — they’ve just gone underground. It seemed that people have been producing zines for personal satisfaction and selling them online for next to nothing. While these new zines echo the Riot Grrrl zines’ women’s power mentality and black and white, the degree of sophistication is much higher. Some come in full-color, some feature digitally-rendered art and others are mostly plain text. They have names like The New Rad Feminist Bible, You Don’t Know Me, and Queen of the Neighborhood: Cutthroat Cutie. Imagination, it seems, has no limits when it comes to feminist zines.
Essentially, social media allows us to do what zines used to in the ’90s which is to say whatever we desire. I can only explain the recent flourishing of zines as a result of the need for more personal reading material in an age where being on the internet means talking to the void, hoping for someone to respond. As the concept of political, socio-economic, cultural and social equality for women and men has taken off in mainstream and fringe media over the past few years, it appears that these content creators have come out of hiding to reclaim their rightful place as feminist zinesters.
There is also something to be said about the small production scale of zines. I love knowing that I now own one of 40 or so copies of them. Honestly, reading a handcrafted work of art that contains someone else’s secrets makes me feel special. They are a labor of love. Holding a zine is akin to holding someone’s child in your hands.
It’s important to note that while growing up, I read a lot of young-adult fiction written mainly by white women. At the time, the fact that the authors of all the books I loved so much did not look like me, and that most of the books featured a Super Special Girl™ and her perpetually brooding, leather-jacket-wearing boyfriend, did not matter much to me. That is, until I realized that feminism was and is a thing.
I like to think I became the ultra-feminist — I even have an equality-demanding sticker on my laptop case to prove it. But while Gloria Steinem and bell hooks are great feminist authors, being a college student means I do not have enough time to read. Feminist zines have given me the opportunity delve into the exciting world of feminist literature on a small, intimate level.

Nothing speaks more toward the desperation of the right wing to slow the progress of sexual assault reform than a complaint against sexual assault prevention training. But when the University was forced to issue an apology to students in response to a complaint that the training “was just full of super personal questions,” it was a troubling indication of pushback against sexual assault prevention education at a time when it is especially crucial, given the pervasiveness and gravity of sexual assault on college campuses — including ours.
So when online publications were littered with headlines like the Daily Caller’s “USC Forces Students to Disclose Sexual History to Sign Up for Classes,” such complaints alluded to a misperception that the University’s anonymous survey requesting information on undergraduate sexual behavior — including questions on frequency and safety measures taken — is proof of a liberal plot to engage in Big Brother style personal surveillance.
It is true that the survey mentioned in the complaint was explicitly voluntary. It is true that the questions were non-explicit in nature and sought to gain statistical information to improve student sexual safety. It is true that the complaint came months after the module was assigned and completed. Yet, news stations and tabloids like Campus Reform, Fox News and the Daily Wire have sought to profit off of the creation of scandal by taking the miniscule amount of information and sad explanation offered in order to smear USC’s attempt, and the attempts of multiple other public and private universities,  to curb sexual predation on its campus.
The single student complaint claimed that the module, administered by Campus Clarity, included prying sexual questions and a scenario in which a male was unfairly blamed for sexual assault. However, such a claim strongly distorts the purpose behind each of these stages of the module — and this misrepresentation was perpetuated by tabloids that published the student complaint.
The survey questions the complaint refers to are designed to gather broad information on the sexual activities of undergraduate students in order to improve sexual assault prevention and sexual safety training. Through an understanding of the most pervasive habits of college students, the module publisher as well as participating universities can most effectively target time and funding. Despite the necessity of this data, the module accounts for some students’ unwillingness or discomfort with sharing such information — and thus explicitly states that each and every question is wholly optional, in addition to placing the questions at the end of the training — after the student has received a notification that they have received credit for completion of the module.
The scenario cited by the student portrayed a female student who attended a party and became blackout drunk. A male student, depicted as having consumed two or three alcoholic beverages, approached the young woman and propositioned her. She began to lose consciousness as the two engaged in sexual behavior. He did not cease his advances despite his awareness of her state. The following morning, the male student talks to a friend about the encounter, and his friend cautions him that the situation may have constituted sexual assault. In no way does the situation suggest that both parties are equally inebriated, nor does the module suggest that the male partner is always responsible for a sexual situation involving alcohol. Conversely, the situation is meant to portray an archetype of a male student taking advantage of a female student’s alcohol consumption.
Not only are the complaints against the University’s sexual assault prevention course completely unfounded, they also underscore a seemingly inevitable — but also dangerous — backlash against assault prevention education. Just as some have started to shift their attention away from the plight of victims in legal sexual assault battles on college campuses and to the “rights of the accused,” the University’s apology in response to complaints is troubling. And to sexual assault resource advocates who have fought for years to institute assault prevention education, it’s tragic to see opposition form so quickly and over a matter so insignificant when compared to the overall importance of preventing college students from getting raped.
It’s assault victims, instead of the students perturbed by an optional questionnaire, that demonstrate why now — more than ever — sexual assault training must be wholeheartedly supported. And yes, there is a tinge of discomfort that comes with taking the mental effort to think about what consent means. But it is a small part of a much larger, much more necessary conversation — to dismantle the conceptions that create and perpetuate a culture in which sexual predation still pervades college campuses.
What has happened to my alma mater?  I suppose you support Roe v. Wade, (because “privacy!”) while requiring incoming students to divulge their sexual history in order to register for classes?  Are you insane?
The found the questions were triggering and I don’t think I should be asked to disclose such information by my university even if it is “voluntary”. I don’t think you need to make this a partisan issue- if people are uncomfortable with their university asking these questions in a survey then they should be perfectly allowed to express that.

The year 2015 was undeniably noteworthy for our student government. With the most packed senate meetings in USC history, we saw our campus peak with engagement and enthusiasm for hot-button topics. With exciting programming such as an inspiring talk from the beloved Laverne Cox to the tunes of Miguel at our fall Conquest concert, our campus came alive to, quite literally, the sound of music. We advocated on pressing issues such as diversity, equity and inclusion, college affordability/administrative financial transparency, mental health and sexual assault prevention. We funded student trips such as the SoCal VoCals’ journey to sing at the White House to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama and helped numerous organizations reach their maximum potential through financial support.
With our 120-person cabinet of highly motivated members and greater body of delegates, we passionately spoke up on issues that mattered to our student community. Our advocacy work did not go without results: We saw an increase in the number of counselors at the health center, mental health will now be incorporated in orientation sessions, the University announced a task force and increased funding was dedicated to diversity. For a full list of our accomplishments, we hope you will explore our end-of-the-year report, which we will release at the end of this semester.
Along the way, we noticed a change on our campus, and we hope you did, too. Regardless of what opinion students held on particular issues, the unprecedented campus engagement is a victory in and of itself. We noticed our community join us in our work in ways student government has never seen before. With an astoundingly high number of delegates joining our USG committees, eager underclassmen offering their ideas for change and advocates joining us from faculty and alumni, it is evident the work of our student government was truly a team effort.
In this new year, we have so much more in store for you. When we were both elected, we vowed real results and that is what our team has continued to deliver on. From continuing to advocate for a fall break (which we plan to present again to the Faculty Senate in the coming months), leading the charge for a tuition freeze, meeting with ITS to make Wi-Fi improvements, making advances on the interface for a campus-wide mobile application, advocating for certification programs, creating a campus network of community organizations, advocating for an undocumented student resource center, increasing the options of affordable food on campus and ensuring faculty receive mental health training and renovating TroGro, we have a lot we look forward to pushing forward. We hope you will join us in providing feedback and extending your vision for what you would like to see happen on our campus by e-mailing us at usgcomm@usc.edu or dropping by our office in TCC 224.
Student government can and has made a difference at USC; we thank you for your continued support in making our community the best that it can be. Here’s to a great 2016!

As the fall semester came to a close, the Daily Trojan entered its winter hiatus,and students across campus started to leave for other parts of the country and world, thousands of students — I’m sure — clicked “trash” when they saw yet another memo from Provost Michael Quick. Unfortunately, doing so may have neglected one of the most groundbreaking commitments from the University, as well as the culmination of years of student and faculty advocacy.
I’m talking, of course, about Sustainability 2020, the comprehensive sustainability plan which could set the University on the course to becoming a pioneer for sustainable planning in the realm of higher education. That resolution, however, comes with a big “if” — it can only succeed if students continue to hold administrators accountable, and if administrators are transparent with students about the implementation of Sustainability 2020 and continue to keep student leaders involved.
Granted, it’s high time that such an extensive plan hit Trousdale Parkway. As the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s biggest institutional customer, the University plays a major role in local energy consumption, and an overhaul of its sustainability plan could set precedent for other major corporate citizens in Los Angeles. Moreover, if Sustainability 2020 materializes fully, it would effectively create a blueprint for other major universities to follow nationally. So there’s a lot riding on the success of this plan.
The plan encompasses much of what would be expected in one aimed to make the University more green — water conservation campaigns, waste diversion and responsible purchasing practices. However, it’s also surprisingly innovative. The promise to incorporate environmental literacy into science curricula and the commitment to make campuses “living laboratories” for sustainability by further engaging students in green projects hint at an approach that is both interdisciplinary — which is oh-so-USC — and heavily dependent on student involvement.
But sustainability advocates can’t get too busy celebrating their victory to forget the work that still needs to be done, both to implement Sustainability 2020 and to expand its breadth. The details of the sub-plans within Sustainability 2020 — including the Climate Action Plan which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a formal bike plan which has been discussed for years to no avail — remain to be seen. The University’s employee transit policy, which was changed to incentivize employees to park cars instead of take public transit, still remains in place with no plans within Sustainability 2020 to remove it. And the University has still not tapped enough into renewable energies, including solar energy, despite student protests in favor. Students should keep a watchful eye — not just now or this semester, but over the next few years — to ensure that Sustainability 2020 really is achieved and continue to push for bigger and better sustainability goals.
The University, however, has made a real commitment to creating realistic objectives — at least until 2020. Sustainability advocacy at this University can feel slow, especially when students are met with lackluster administrative response. But considering that Undergraduate Student Government’s Environmental Student Assembly was created just two years ago, it’s exciting to see students taking part in creating real, meaningful change — and the University collaborating with them to do so.
But though environmental student leaders have been doing their part working on Sustainability 2020 — and Undergraduate Student Government just funded the Environmental Student Assembly’s plan to attend a sustainability conference in Oregon — it’s tragic that there just hasn’t been the same kind of excitement around sustainability, even as our campus saw a well-documented rise in political activism last semester. Moreover, having lived through what mainstream media has again and again described as a “historic” drought this past year in Southern California, Trojans really should be paying attention. Maybe a look through the e-mail archives to find “Memo: Sustainability 2020” is a good place to start.

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate cleared up unfinished business before voting to fund a sustainability conference for leaders of the Environmental Student Assembly at its first meeting of the semester Tuesday evening in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
ESA, a USG body composed of several student organizations — including the Environmental Core, Greeks Go Green and the USC Bike Coalition — aims to “program events promoting the green culture, sustainability, and environmental advocacy at USC,” according to its website.
At Tuesday’s meeting, three members of the organization’s executive board — Director Ahlia Bethea and Assistant Directors Elliott Wezerek and Kaitlin Kinsella — introduced their plan to attend the Twelfth International Conference on Environmental, Cultural, Economic and Social Sustainability, and requested funding from the Senate.
The conference, which will take place in Portland, Oregon from  Jan. 21-23, will explore themes of environmental sustainability, sustainable economics, sustainability in policy and practice and sustainability in education through a variety of publication presentations, workshops, exhibits, discussions and plenary speakers.
“It’s an academic conference looking at the frontiers of sustainability in a very broad sense,” Wezerek said.
Wezerek, Bethea and Kinsella requested $1,790 to cover airfare, lodging and conference registration fees; they plan to pay for food and in-conference transportation out of pocket.
The goal of attending the conference, according to Wezerek, is to develop leadership and facilitate advocacy in environmental sustainability in accordance with the Sustainability 2020 plan unveiled in December.
ESA leaders who attend the event can  learn from speakers and events at the conference, and bring back what they learn to help implement sustainable practices at USC.
“There hasn’t been a student engagement piece with Sustainability 2020,” Wezerek said. “Students don’t feel like they’re connected to the document or have any input, so this is a chance for them to feel like they have a voice.”
The proposal was approved with a unanimous vote from the USG Senate.
“We’re all really excited, because we’re happy to see that USC, and the Senate in particular, is so invested in the advancement of its student leaders,” Bethea said after the vote.
“This conference is going to do a lot for us — we’re going to learn a lot, gain a lot of valuable resources and connections that’s going to enable us to better serve our constituents. Anything that we can do to better ourselves, and in turn better the community and the world, is something that’s important to us.”
Before moving on to new business, including the ESA proposal, the Senate swore in three new USG justices. The meeting also established an agenda for future votes; next week, the Senate will vote on a budget reallocation proposal, which suggests moving $5,000 in funding to support the newly-created Service Student Assembly. The funding had previously been reserved for a proposed Religious Student Assembly, which was never formed.
Toward the end of the meeting, USG Vice President Jordan Fowler announced junior Tricia Xu as the new USG Parliamentarian for Spring 2016. Xu, a business administration major, will ensure that Senate meetings follow parliamentary procedure.
USG Program Board Director Diana Jimenez also nominated three students to executive positions; the Senate will vote on the approval of these appointments next week.
I was one of the students that worked very hard on Sustainability 2020. To clarify: students were involved in every committee that determined the metrics in Sustainability 2020. They were also advocates of the plan moving forward. An issue for all student organizations is legacy and institutional memory as administrations transition, as many efforts are quickly forgotten a year or two after issues arise. Additionally, students need to show up or send other representation when invited to meetings large or small.

USC has been recently chosen as one of 21 universities represented on LinkedIn’s publishing platform, LinkedIn Pulse, as part of a new initiative, the LinkedIn Campus Editor Program.
LinkedIn bought Pulse, a professional publishing platform, for $90 million in April 2013. The LinkedIn Pulse website functions as a communal blog.
Members can publish articles through this platform everywhere, sharing their work with LinkedIn’s users. It serves a hub of creative and self-reflective content from varying perspectives in different arenas of the job market.
Since purchasing Pulse, LinkedIn has served a wider purpose than solely creating online resumes and managing professional networking. LinkedIn has repeatedly pushed to become one of the major players in the social media arena in regards to personal branding, promotion and student engagement. This is achieved in part through the LinkedIn Campus Editor Program made available through Pulse.
USC is one of the first campuses to have a LinkedIn Campus Editor. The USC branch is led by Natalie Riso, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
“By editing their articles, they not only are able to have confidence in the soundness of their articles, but anything edited by a Campus Editor is also considered for extra promotion in the Pulse Channels,” said Riso in an email to the Daily Trojan. “These promotions can turn your article from a reach of your connections to LinkedIn’s millions of users.”
In addition to being named one of the 21 LinkedIn Campus Editors, Riso has been named one of LinkedIn’s Top Voices of 2015 last quarter as part of LinkedIn’s effort to promote student engagement. These top ten individuals were ranked by LinkedIn data and awarded this honor in their respective fields of expertise. Some areas include finance, social media, marketing, venture capital and health care. LinkedIn’s recognition of Riso’s work in the marketing sector has increased the celebrity and popularity of her published articles on her LinkedIn page.
LinkedIn has also launched a new initiative, Student Voices, in addition to the Campus Editor program.
This platforms allows university students to chime into a different conversation each month, centered on a broad theme provided by LinkedIn. Students draw on personal experiences, current events and their field of study at their own college. For example, Student Voices kicked off 2016 with January’s topic, “New Year, New Me.” The stories submitted to this sector with the hashtag “#StudentVoices” are then reviewed by the LinkedIn Campus Editor from that respective institution.
“As a Campus Editor, I am in charge of curating the best content USC has to offer from its students,” Riso said. “This includes finding top achievers in the USC ecosystem and editing their work for LinkedIn.”
Riso said that having someone editing other people’s stories will not only help the quality of their work but also help connect users to more people online.
“As one of 21 universities chosen by LinkedIn, it is an absolute honor to be chosen as one of the first campuses to have a LinkedIn Campus Editor and to be recognized as one of the most impressive student bodies,” Riso said.

A new plan implemented by the Obama administration is helping college students repay their federal student loans. The plan, known as Revised Pay As You Earn, or REPAYE, expands the availability of the previous Pay As You Earn repayment plan to more student borrowers and modifies some of the terms of repayment.
Under the REPAYE plan, students’ monthly loan payments are prohibited from exceeding 10 percent of their discretionary income over the repayment period, and all balances are forgiven after 20 years of qualifying payments. With the new plan, payments increase and decrease as a borrower’s income changes, regardless of the degree of change in income. This is different from PAYE, which set a maximum amount that monthly payments could not exceed. The switch from PAYE to REPAYE also makes an income-driven repayment plan available to Direct Loan borrowers who may have previously been ineligible for PAYE.
In a press release, then-Secretary of Education Arne Duncan cited manageable student loan debt as a “central theme” of the Obama administration’s higher education policy.
“REPAYE is one of a number of key national economic policies this Administration has implemented to make America again the leader in college graduates in the world, while preventing student borrowers from facing unmanageable student loan debt,” Duncan said in the release.
Etienne Smith, a freshman studying print and digital journalism, thought that the program would be a good security blanket for those students who may not earn a lot after they graduate.
“I’m glad it’s available to me. There’s no guarantee that I will make tons of money in the future, especially going into journalism,” Smith said. “So I think it’s a good thing that I can have comfort knowing that my biggest problem won’t be student loans for the education that’s supposed to make me able to pay back my student loans.”
USC Financial Aid Dean Thomas McWhorter acknowledged the benefit of REPAYE in making student loans more affordable.
“Programs such as REPAYE will benefit students who may need help with keeping college loan repayments affordable,” McWhorter said. “While students who graduate from USC have a lower-than-average student loan debt and a default rate of less than 2 percent, we always look for ways to manage costs and maintain affordability. USC continues to provide financial aid to meet the full demonstrated need of our undergraduates.”
Boka Agboje, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment, has multiple federal student loans and felt that the new repayment options would prove beneficial for college students in general.
“It goes without saying that college is extraordinarily expensive,” Agboje said. “I feel like the cost of attending college has far outpaced the growing value of [it]. I appreciate the option of different payment plans, because different folks have different needs.”
Revised Pay As You Earn, announced Dec. 17, joins the original Pay As You Earn plan, the Income-Based Repayment Plan and the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan in a group of four income-driven payment options for federal student loan borrowers.
According to a Department of Education website, “the plans differ in terms of who qualifies, how much [the borrower has] to pay each month, the length of the repayment period, and the types of loans that can be repaid under the plan.”
With a low enough income, the site says, monthly payments could reach as low as $0 per month.

In a continuation of their coverage of the 2016 election cycle, the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a watch party and panel discussion for U.S. President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address. The event took place at Tommy’s Place and hosted a panel including Democratic strategy expert Drew Lieberman, Republican expert Chris Faulkner and student representatives from the USC College Republicans and USC College Democrats.
In his address, Obama covered a wide array of topics ranging from the closing of Guantanamo Bay to global warming. According to Lieberman, this address was different than the last seven Obama gave because it was his last one.
“There was a clear acknowledgement that the relationship between [Obama] and Congress are irretrievably broken,” Lieberman said. “The political purpose of what he did today was setting the table for passing the torch to the next Democratic contenders.”
After the address concluded, the panel discussion was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, and Sonali Seth, a sophomore majoring in political science and policy planning development and editorial director of the Daily Trojan. Each panel member was asked to discuss a certain topic touched upon by Obama.
Faulkner fielded a question about redistricting, a topic the President spoke vehemently on. In his address, Obama called out political leaders on both sides for a lack of fairness in the election process, a statement that Faulkner agreed on despite a difference in political parties.
“This is one of those times when I will double down and agree with [Obama] 100 percent,” Faulkner said. “When we let legislators pick their voters, instead of voters picking their legislators, everybody loses.”
Another topic discussed by the panel was the current economic state of the country. Leesa Danzek, vice president of the USC College Republicans, argued against the points that Obama brought up about the economy. The economy was the topic that Obama spoke about the least in his address, but he repeatedly mentioned that the economy is strong and fully recovered from the recession of 2008. In direct opposition to this statement, Danzek said that the economy should be a greater focus in the upcoming elections.
“I think many Americans, particularly the middle class, don’t see the economy recovering,” Danzek said. “I was disappointed for him to paint a picture of the economy as being better. I think that we really have an opportunity for Americans to decide which framework for bettering the economy we will see in the future.”
The panel ended with questions from the audience, who filled the chairs in Tommy’s Place at the start of the address. Schnur pointed out that this was the largest attendance to a State of the Union address in the past eight years. This trend of wider student involvement has been seen throughout all of Unruh’s election-related events thus far this year.
For Schnur, the immediate goal in hosting election events and panels is to create a forum for student political discussion. To further this goal, Schnur includes students in every level of the debates — from the audience to the panel moderators and members — in order to create a tangible platform for students to disagree on political topics in a respectful, insightful way.
“We want to create an environment where different opinions can thrive,” Schnur said. “Ultimately, students are going to leave these events with fundamentally the same opinions as they came with. But the discussion is where they see that someone who disagrees with them isn’t evil or stupid, they’re just another intelligent person who arrived at a different opinion. That’s the most important aspect of these events.”
