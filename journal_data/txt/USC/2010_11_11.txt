Based on USC’s track record, Thursday’s nonconference matchup with No. 10 Pepperdine should have been as smooth as the coastal breeze.
Fighting · Junior goalie Joel Dennerley defends the goal against Pepperdine on Thursday night. The Trojans escaped with a 7-6 victory. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
In late September, the Trojans traveled to Malibu, Calif., for a similar contest with the Waves, where they netted a total of 13 goals en route to their 11th consecutive win of the season.
But for the No. 2 USC men’s water polo team (21-2, 4-2), Thursday’s home game with Pepperdine proved all too challenging, as the Trojans avoided a close scare with a narrow 7-6 win, much to the chagrin of both coaches and players.
“It’s good to get the win, but it is disappointing, for we were hoping to come out and play a lot better,” said junior goalie Joel Dennerley. “We have high expectations for ourselves.”
USC coach Jovan Vavic was quick to express similar displeasure as well.
“I’m not sure we were ever really focused on this game,” Vavic said. “This is a young team, and sometimes coming off a big win, they don’t know how to get themselves ready for each game.”
But at least in the early goings, it appeared as if Vavic’s bunch was prepared and poised for yet another double-digit scoring outburst.
In the first frame, USC scored a total of four goals in a span of five minutes on behalf of junior two-meter Matt Burton, junior driver Peter Kurzeka, redshirt sophomore driver Forest Monroe and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey. Rapsey’s goal was particularly impressive, coming with just one second remaining in the period, and breaking the 3-3 stalemate.
“We had opportunities, particularly 6-on-5 opportunities,” Vavic said.
But despite those opportunities, USC failed to build on its initial lead, allowing a sub-.500 Pepperdine squad to remain within striking distance.
For nearly seven minutes in the second quarter, USC was scoreless before a pair of last-minute goals from redshirt freshmen driver Stephen Siri and freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie, which ballooned USC’s lead to three.
In the second half, however, things took a turn for the worse, as the Trojans were outscored 3-1 and sloppy play prevented the USC from spearheading a late run.
“Pepperdine played us tough, but we really took some shots that were ill-advised,” Vavic said. “We created opportunities, we drew ejections and then we just took bad shots.”
Although a third-quarter goal from Kurzeka marked the team’s lone second half score, Vavic made a point to note some positives, as well.
“The most important thing is that we won a game,” Vavic said. “We’re 21-2, and we had a hard week of training too. I’m not concerned. We’re going to come back, rebound and have a big week.”
To win, however, the Trojans were forced to rely on their anchor, Dennerley, and a defense that was able to preserve the team’s narrow lead.
“In the last two games, we’ve given up five and six goals, which is not bad,” Vavic said. “Overall, our execution could have been better, but still, defensively, we did a good job. We stopped them and we won a game. It’s not always going to be pretty.”
Dennerley was quick to echo similar sentiments, noting the team’s strong play in various 5-on-6 defensive situations.
“We had to come up with some big stops,” Dennerley said. “We stopped them on a number of occasions on 5-on-6s, which is always good to do when you’re a man down.”
Despite the win, Dennerley and company won’t be afforded the opportunity to relax any time soon as a Saturday Mountain Pacific Sports Federation contest against Long Beach State awaits.
“I think we need to improve our communication and awareness in both defense and attack,” Dennerley said. “If we do that and go into the game with a better focus, we’ll prevail.”
Despite two easy wins against the 49ers, Vavic stressed the importance of staying focused.
“We need to have a good game against Long Beach,” Vavic said. “That’s going to be a big game because, for them, it’s the most important game of the year.”

In anticipation of the usual increase in vehicle-related crimes over the Thanksgiving and Winter breaks, the Department of Public Safety is encouraging students to use its gift of free parking.
The Group Initiative For Theft-prevention is an annual crime-prevention campaign that attempts to reduce the amount of vehicle burglaries and motor vehicle thefts in the USC community during extended university breaks.
Free parking is offered to students, staff and faulty in the University Park Campus Parking Center and the Biggy Parking Structure at the Health Sciences Campus.
“Criminals know that most students will be off campus during break,” DPS Crime Prevention Specialist Wyman Thomas said. “Students leave vehicles on streets or in their apartments and come back after breaks to find them burglarized or even stolen.”
GIFT will be offered from Nov. 24 to Nov. 29 during Thanksgiving break, and Dec. 13 through Jan. 10 for Winter Recess.
Those wishing to take advantage of the program will need a USCard to pick up a parking pass at DPS headquarters in Parking Structure A, beginning Nov. 17.
Students will also have access to a free shuttle service to Los Angeles International Airport by reservation.
Since the introduction of GIFT in 2005, there has been a 65 percent reduction in vehicle-related crime on both USC campuses, Thomas said, as well as a 79 percent reduction in auto burglaries (vehicles that have been broken into) and a 67 percent reduction in grand theft auto (when a suspect steals a vehicle).
Although those statistics are an improvement, according to DPS records, four auto burglaries were reported and one automobile was reported stolen during the 2009 holiday break.
Still, DPS officials said the program helps protect student vehicles.
“What’s great about the UPC Parking Center is that there will be heightened security when you leave your vehicle in the structure. We have officers who are stationed in the lot to help reduce any suspicious activity,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
Most students who will end up using GIFT are out-of-state students or those who live farther away from campus, he said.
Funmi Akinyode, a sophomore from Washington, D.C. majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said she plans to use GIFT.
“After my friend’s car was broken into one night on the street, I’m a little skeptical about where I leave my car,” Akinyode said. “I have parking outside my apartment, but I have less chances of something happening to my car when it’s inside an actual parking structure.”
Carlisle said students who park near campus should take precautions over breaks.
“If students do leave a car on campus, they should park it in a well-lit area with no valuables visible,” Carlisle said. “Anything of value should be locked in the trunk. There are criminals who will break the window of a car just for small change.”

After a strong showing against Biola on Tuesday night, the Women of Troy officially kick off their season with a showdown against the Gonzaga Bulldogs (1-0) at the Galen Center today at 1 p.m.
In control · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath will help lead USC against a Gonzaga team that went undefeated in conference play last season. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan 
“[Playing against Biola] was a good game for us considering what we’re trying to do,” USC coach Michael Cooper said. “We had our lulls, but we got it together and we were able to put them away.”
The Women of Troy showed off a newly fortified and healthy lineup that saw five players hit double figures in the 93-66 win.
One lingering issue from last season was missing during the exhibition game as the Women of Troy outrebounded Biola 41-26 as well.
“I was pleased with our rebounding against a smaller team,” Cooper said. “I was happy with the effort we made since we’ve been working on that.”
Two freshmen that are expected to make significant contributions this season started off their Trojan careers on a high note. Freshman forward Cassie Harberts scored 14 points and grabbed six rebounds, while fellow freshman guard Len’Nique Brown scored 11 points and grabbed six rebounds.
Along with these two, the Women of Troy also received solid contributions from their returning core group of players.
Senior center Kari LaPlante (20 points), sophomore forward Christina Marinacci (17 points), senior guard Jacki Gemelos (12 points) and junior guard Ashley Corral (six points, nine assists) continued their strong play from last season.
Junior guard Briana Gilbreath came off the bench and saw limited action because of a lingering shoulder injury but is expected to be back in the starting lineup today.
Defensively, the Women of Troy know they need to do a better job against the Bulldogs, who come into the Galen Center after a 115-51 beat down of Western Oregon University in their exhibition game last Saturday.
Last season, the Bulldogs (29-5, 16-0) reeled off a perfect record in conference play on their way to the NCAA tournament, before falling in the regional semifinal game to Xavier.
They return two of their four leading scorers from last year in guard Courtney Vandersloot and guard/forward Katelan Redmon and look poised to make another run at a West Coast Conference title.
With these two returning, the Women of Troy know they will have their hands full.
“Transition defense is big,” Corral said. “[Vandersloot] is one of the best point guards in the nation and we’ve got to get up on her early. And boxing out is always [key].”
Despite a strong performance against Biola, the coaching staff believes there is room for improvement.
“I was pleased with our performance in spots,” Cooper said. “I thought it was a good effort and a lot of people got to play, but there is still a long process to this.”

With the holiday season rapidly approaching and the pages of our planners full of social engagements for the next two months in rushed cursive, the age-old question arises: “What do I wear?”
Photo courtesy of Keemia
This is probably followed by a frantic flipping through hangers of impeccably hung dresses from years past.
Fear not. Instead of worrying and planning your doomed battle against the 110 Freeway while mapping out trips to Beverly Hills, students can simply stroll over to Trousdale Parkway on Nov. 16 for the Keemia Holiday Sample Sale.
Keemia, a fashion line specializing in cocktail and wedding dresses, was started by designer and USC alumna Keemia Ferasat.
Starting just after graduation at the age of 22, Ferasat managed to attract boutique buyers and socialites alike to her Los Angeles studio with her fusion of Middle Eastern vitality and European sensibility.
But finding a distinct style to develop wasn’t easy for the then-recent graduate.
“It’s been a lot of work, a lot of trial and error, a lot of refining and kind of standing back, taking another approach, getting to the idea of this woman that we are trying to portray,” Ferasat said.
The line debuted in January 2005 on campus at the USC Fashion Show in Town & Gown, and since then it has evolved into an international label.
In March 2005, Ferasat debuted the line’s first collection, “Love on the Loire,” during Los Angles Fashion Week, which helped to establish the type of customer Keemia  is aimed at — one who is “feminine, at ease with herself and chic,” according to Ferasat. More recently, the line has shown collections at the Prêt à Porter Paris show and the Dallas Bridal Show.
Since its debut, Ferasat has expanded the line from Los Angeles to a New York-based label that has been featured in several fashion magazines and websites, including, Glamour, Elle and Lucky.
No longer just a pet passion project shown off at Town & Gown, Ferasat’s efforts have resulted in Keemia being sold at numerous boutiques in 11 states, along with stores in the Cayman Islands and Singapore. In addition, the line is now available for purchase online at several websites.
Despite the brand’s international success, Ferasat said she still holds USC and the Trojan Family in a special place in her heart.
In June, Ferasat participated in the SCtyle: USC’s Sample Sale For Scholarship event. Hosted annually by the USC Alumni Club of West Los Angeles, the event took place at the Fairmont Mirimar Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., and featured several vendors.
The fundraiser raised thousands of dollars for USC’s Scholarship Fund and every donation was matched 2-1 by the university.
Now Ferasat is returning to campus to show off and sell some of Keemia’s Spring 2011 Collection. After seeing the American Ballet Theatre perform The Sleeping Beauty, Ferasat was intrigued and charmed by the elaborate tutus and jeweled bodices of the graceful ballerinas, and worked to design a wearable version of these whimsical costumes.
“I wanted the romance back, but in the confines of what I do. Yes, it’s been a good, long run for the short, frothy cocktail look, and Keemia’s been one of the go-to designers for it. But even girls who did short-short and tight-tight with unblinking dedication are feeling for something a bit softer,” Ferasat said. “In other words, a ripe moment for this designer to shift gears to a more sophisticated style.”
To go along with that new focus, Ferasat made sure that the Spring Collection played with the idea of contrast within a single silhouette. She focused on creating a symbiotic aesthetic relationship between the simplicity of the silk organza and chiffon and the more intricate detailing on the bodices in the line’s new dresses.
Along with using USC as a place to test out her new collection, Ferasat has stayed close to other Trojan alumni, using them to help build connections within the fashion industry.
“We pull dresses from Keemia frequently. The collection is one of the highest in demand,” said Emily McDonald, a USC alumna and founder of the website Stylist LA. “Girls always ask for it.”
With prices normally ranging from $300 to $500, the sample sale on campus is an opportunity for students to find dresses for the upcoming holiday season at a lower price from a member of the Trojan Family.
As the seasons change, so do the fashions, and Ferasat’s line makes for a good way to embrace both transitions.

What separates one man from another? What motivates people toward the actions they take?
These were the driving questions behind Jean-Pierre Melville’s films.
It is a shame his work is not better known in the United States today. A forerunner of the French New Wave, he was a member of the French Resistance during World War II and a devout admirer of American culture and cinema (born Jean-Pierre Grumbach, his last name is an homage to American writer Herman Melville).
His films explored the ideas of personal codes, crime and the relationship between the criminal world and the rest of humanity. Although he might not be well known to those in the United States, his influence still reigns. His 1967 film noir Le Samourai, about a lonesome hitman, shaped later films, such as John Woo’s The Killer and Jim Jarmusch’s Killer Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai.
Melville’s films were often low-budget film noirs, focusing on criminals and their actions. They were distinct in their style, reaching existential arguments without trading substance for flair. Nowhere is this more evident than in Le Cercle Rouge (1970).
The film displays all aspects of Melville’s style, from his editing to his deliberate pacing. It works as a character study, a social critique and a heist film, with no focus overpowering the other.
The movie opens silently with a prisoner escaping from a train. We do not learn until later that he is a murderer, though it does not matter, as such details are not important in Melville’s world.
In Melville’s world, there is little difference between criminal and cop. They are two faces of the same coin, each as ruthless and cunning as the other.
They are drawn together by fate, unknowingly destined to meet — as the title card forewarns. This is the point of the film. Who can keep track of the seemingly infinite connections that bind humanity together? Even the most clear and best laid plans can be undone by the very forces that brought it into being. Fate, which brought men together in one instant, can in the next tear them apart.
This existential logic is intriguing enough, but the true brilliance of the film lies in the fact that it is at heart a superbly executed, simple heist film. The players are just stock characters, and the setup is simple.
A recently released conman, Corey (Alain Delon), has learned how to rob a jewelry store. Incapable of doing so on his own, he recruits the help of Vogel (Gian Maria Volonté), a recently escaped murderer. True to form, they meet by chance when Vogel hides in the trunk of Corey’s car to escape police.
This leads to a brilliant scene between the two after Corey has driven to an open field. It is an exercise in superior exterior photography and sparse dialogue. Vogel emerges from the trunk holding Corey at gunpoint.
“Aren’t you afraid?” he asks.
“Of what?” Corey replies.
“Of me, for one. And of getting caught by the police.”
To this, Corey silently tosses a pack of cigarettes to Vogel, and their companionship is sealed.
To help them in their heist, they recruit Jansen (Yves Montand), an alcoholic ex-cop and sharpshooter. Corey rescues him from a den of booze and monstrous visions. Standing in their way is the cat-loving Captain Mattei (Andre Bourvil), the man who was escorting Vogel when he escaped.
With Mattei’s job on the line, he is willing to strike crooked deals with members of the underworld and is just as morally compromised as the men he is pursuing.
Melville’s characters are stoic. They are grim, and they talk little. They have work to do. Their lives are not glamorous, and they don’t expect them to be. They are driven neither by delusions of grandeur nor psychological disorders. In fact, Melville never reveals their motivations — it is an unspoken element of the film.
The filmmaking echoes the characters. The editing is deliberate, neither fast nor slow but instead determined. Melville tells his story on his own time. You, the audience, must wait and allow the characters to reveal themselves in pieces. It is a welcome reprieve from the “flash bang,” rapid-cut, action-oriented thrillers of today.
Not that Le Cercle Rouge  lacks excitement — it doesn’t. The shootouts and chases are superb, made sublime by the deliberate editing that allows true fear and doubt to build in the minds of the audience. Good things come to those who wait. Today, it is a forgotten lesson, but one that Melville understood well.
The influences of the American gangster genre are readily apparent in his work. Much of the approach to character in Le Cercle Rouge can in fact be explained by the post-war cynicism that took hold of France after World War II.
The coloring (Melville frequently used beautiful blue hues) can be seen as patriotic. Though the basic structure of the film is reminiscent of the old pre-war Warner Bros. gangster films, this film is French. Like Kurosawa, who took Western literature and made it Japanese, Melville does the same with the American gangster flick.
Whereas its origins were pulpy and built on shock value, Melville took the tropes and arranged them in such a way that Le Cercle Rouge and his other films reach a philosophical level the American films did not even consider.
In so doing, he took a genre defined by low budgets and high entertainment value and elevated it to the realm of art. He made it beautiful.

There are a lot of differences between last season’s USC men’s basketball squad and this year’s team, which opens its regular season on Saturday.
Back for more · In his second year with USC, coach Kevin O’Neill will guide a Trojan team that is once again eligible to play in the postseason. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Sure, players have come and gone since last March, but likely the biggest change is the mindset of the team, which knows that it is eligible for postseason competition after last year’s self-imposed sanctions kept them out.
“Now we have a chance to play for something,” junior forward Nikola Vucevic said. “Last year, we were not really playing for anything, so it was not that fun to play. This year, we are a good team, and I think we can make the NCAA tournament. It will be a fun season when you can go on to compete against the best.”
When USC announced sanctions on Jan. 3 as a result of NCAA rules violations related to former Trojans guard O.J. Mayo, the team was on an eight-game winning streak, which included winning the Diamond Head Classic in Honolulu, upsetting then-No. 9 Tennessee by 22 points and sweeping the two Arizona schools to open Pac-10 competition.
After the sanctions were announced, USC lost its next two games, and five of its next seven.
“I remember having to tell these guys on a Sunday morning that we were not going to play in the postseason,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “For me, it was traumatic to have to tell them that, let alone for them to hear it. The empty feeling of knowing that you could not play in the conference tournament and that your season was done was really difficult for our players to deal with, and for me to deal with.”
Despite the sanctions, the Trojans played well at times last season. Highlights included beating UCLA twice by a combined 25 points, as well as twice defeating Washington, which ended up making the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament. However, the Trojans struggled down the stretch, losing their final five games.
“We have an opportunity [this season],” O’Neill said. “I am proud of the job that the guys did last year, and hopefully it sets the tone for what we are going to do this year.”
The first game of the season is against UC Irvine. It would be easy to overlook the Anteaters (0-1), which lost in an exhibition game to Concordia, a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics school, after trailing by as many as 22 points in the second half. The Anteaters also lost by 14 points at No. 13 Illinois on Monday.
Despite the final score, UC Irvine was impressive against Illinois. After trailing 42-18 at halftime, the Anteaters bested Illinois in scoring in the second half by 10 points behind guard Darren Moore’s 15 second-half points.
Forward Eric Wise returns for the Anteaters after averaging 16.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and three assists per game last season, leading the team in all three categories. He has been named All-Big West second team in both of his collegiate seasons. He recorded the seventh double-double of his career against Illinois, posting 11 points and 12 rebounds.
Tip-off against the Anteaters is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Saturday at the Galen Center.

The main entrance to Leavey Library is currently closed as construction work is taking place underneath the entrance to waterproof Leavey’s basement.
After leaks in the basement occurred, USC Facilities Management Services decided to invest in replacing the existing underground waterproofing system.
“This is a maintenance project intended to replace the waterproofing membrane to stop leaks to the basement below and improve the paving leveling system above the membrane,” wrote Joe Back, associate senior vice president for campus development and facilities management, in an e-mail.
The replacement of the waterproofing system requires the removal of the stone slabs outside the main entrance. These slabs will be reinstalled before the project is completed, and they will appear the same as before, said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming at USC Libraries. The waterproofing that is currently being done should last for 10 to 15 years, he said.
Construction fencing has been put up around the work, which forced the closure of Leavey’s main entrance. Instead, the library has opened a side entrance on the west side of the building.
Although the leakage in the library’s basement is not major, FMS wanted to fix it in order to preserve the quality of the building, McHarg said.
“There’s just one room that’s currently used as a storage room downstairs that had some leak issues when it rains, but otherwise [the leaks don’t] really affect the collections or any of the areas where students gather,” he said.
Leavey’s hours of operation and services will not be affected by the construction.
“There’s nothing that’s closed off [in Leavey Library]. All the collections are available; all the services are available. The only issue is having to close the front entrance,” McHarg said.
The project began on Oct. 11 and is expected to be completed shortly after Thanksgiving.
“We have set a finish date of Nov. 29,” Back said. The library entrance, however, is expected to open by Nov. 20, McHarg said.
Funding for the project is coming from FMS operating funds.
During construction, students must use the side entrance to Leavey Library, said Stephen Metzger, a freshman majoring in business administration (cinematic arts).
“[Though] it’s a little bit of an inconvenience, nearly every student on campus uses Leavey in some form or another and any improvements are welcome.” Metzger said.
I agree that it’s nice to see them putting some money into Leavey considering how many students use it, but it’s going to take more than waterproofing to get this place up to par with other college libraries.  It could really use a remodeling and face-lift as the poster above mentioned.  I think the general problem is that being built in the 90’s, the library wasn’t really designed to be functional in the 21st century.  Computers and other electronics are now far ingrained in a student’s study habits than books and other hard-copy resources.  Considering the lack of outlets throughout the library, very un-ergonomic study carrels and chairs, etc., there are many ways in which the library could improve to better meet the needs of students in this modern era.
Leavey needs a face-lift and a remodeling badly

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams will host two meets this weekend at USC’s McDonald’s Swim Stadium. USC will face the Arizona today at 4 p.m. and Arizona State on Saturday at noon.
Today’s meet will be a rare evening event, with the two Trojan teams swimming underneath stadium lights because of the late start time. The USC swimmers, however, are not worried about swimming in the dark.
“I think because of the time change and the weather it’ll be harder, but I think we can still perform to the best of our ability,” said freshman Kasey Carlson. “It’ll be fun because it’s our first real meet with real competition.”
The No. 6 Women of Troy and No. 14 men’s squad, with rankings based on the first College Swimming Coaches Association of America/Collegeswimming.com Top 25 poll of the season, are resuming conference action with the Arizona and Arizona State meets after about a two-week break for both teams. The men and women’s diving teams, however, had a successful diving competition last weekend.
“We’ve got some of the best divers in the country, and what makes it nice is we are really balanced, men and women, swimming and diving,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “We’re one of the very few teams that when we make it to the NCAA championships we’ve made a commitment to diving.”
Throughout the men’s and women’s seasons thus far, USC swimmers have posted high scores and performed well at their meets, and Salo is confident they will not disappoint this weekend.
“We’re just really balanced and I don’t think we are getting the respect that we should out of the Pac-10 teams or nationally, but I think after our meet against Arizona [today] we will show them they need to take USC seriously,” Salo said.
Going up against highly acclaimed Arizona, which is ranked No. 5 in men’s swimming and No. 7 in women’s, USC hopes to pull out all the stops to defeat the Wildcats.
“We always take this dual meet really seriously just because it’s really good competition. I’m really excited for it. I know we are going to post some really great times,” sophomore Haley Anderson said.
Despite being ranked below their opponents, the men’s squad is certain that it has enough strength to help it succeed.
“We really haven’t had to prepare out of the box [for today] because this year the team is so positive and has so much depth that we really don’t need to change much that we do,” junior captain Jeff Daniels said.
The teams’ next meet will be in Tucson, Ariz., next weekend. They will travel together to participate in the Wildcat Invitational, hosted by Arizona. The three-day competition will be their last before the U.S. Nationals in December.
“Hopefully [these meets] will awaken all the other teams and coaches across the country that we shouldn’t be underestimated,” senior captain Lyndsay DePaul said.

It’s tournament time. 
Stepping up · Freshman forward Elizabeth Eddy, who has started every game for USC this season, will be a key player against Illinois. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 22 USC women’s soccer team (12-5-3) is in South Bend, Ind., to take on No. 13 Illinois (13-4-1) in the first round of the 64-team NCAA tournament today at 2 p.m.
It is the Women of Troy’s sixth consecutive tournament appearance, and 12th in the last 13 years. USC won the championship in 2007 and made it to the third round in 2008.
Last season, USC lost in the first round to Oklahoma State on penalty kicks. It was its first opening round exit since 2003, and the only time the Women of Troy have lost in rounds one and two in USC coach Ali Khosroshahin’s tenure.
For Khosroshahin, it was his earliest tournament exit since his first year as a collegiate head coach at Cal State Fullerton in 2001.
This year, the opening round matchup will be intriguing, as there are some striking differences between the two teams. All but two of Illinois’ goals this year have come from assists, while USC has scored 11 goals unassisted. USC has forced more than 100 corner kicks this year, while Illinois has forced just 86. USC has been called for a foul 208 times this season and shown a yellow card 15 times. In contrast, Illinois has been whistled for just 129 fouls this season and has yet to be carded.
“They’re a very disciplined team,” Khosroshahin said. “They’re very organized and are very good with possession.”
Perhaps the biggest contrast is on the score sheet. Of the Fighting Illini’s 31 goals this season, 16 have come from just two players. Forward Megan Pawloski has five, and forward Vanessa DiBernardo has a staggering 11. Only two other players even have three.
Compare that to USC, where freshman forwards Elizabeth Eddy and Autumn Altamirano, along with redshirt junior midfielder Ashli Sandoval, are tied for the team lead with just five goals each. Overall, 11 players have found the back of the net multiple times for the Women of Troy, while only six Illini have scored more than once.
Though senior midfielder Alyssa Dávila admitted that Illinois plays “almost an opposite formation” from the Women of Troy, she said USC will be ready.
“We’re prepared; we’ve been working on defending it,” Dávila said. “We’re ready to go.”
Despite — or perhaps because of — the differences, Khosroshahin’s focus is on his team.
“It’s not so much about preparing for Illinois as it is doing what we do better, sharper, faster and more efficient,” he said. “Hopefully everything that we’ve done throughout the season has prepared us for this. Everything should all be coming together now.”
The single elimination nature of the tournament is something that Khosroshahin particularly wants his players to understand.
“Win or go home,” he said. “We’ve been trying to pound it into their heads. They need to understand the stakes.”
For seniors Dávila, defender Karter Haug and forward Megan Ohai, that just provides extra motivation.
“Our time is out after this,” Dávila said. “We want to go out with a bang.”
This senior class won the national championship as freshmen, and the current freshmen would love to follow in their footsteps.
“I’ve been waiting a whole long time for this,” Eddy said. “I’m really excited. Everything we’ve done this whole year has been to prepare us for the tourney.”
Khosroshahin’s keys to the game, like his preparation, is unchanged for the tournament.
“Maintain discipline defensively and take care of the ball,” he said. “Same at the end of the season as it was at the beginning. We do those two things and our chances are very good.”

Podcast: Can the Trojans tame the pass-happy Wildcats?
After spending their last four weeks in Los Angeles, the Trojans take to the road for three of their final four games, starting Saturday at No. 18 Arizona.
Looking ahead · Senior cornerback Shareece Wright and the Trojans head to Arizona to face the No. 18 Wildcats after pulling out a last-minute win over Arizona State. USC is currently 6-3, and will play three of its last four remaining games on the road. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The Wildcats are coming off a disappointing loss to Stanford, but are the last ranked opponent on USC’s schedule. Kickoff is at 5 p.m.
The Trojans, meanwhile, might still be counting their blessings after a narrow 34-33 win over Arizona State last week. Nevertheless, with no possibility of a bowl game because of NCAA sanctions, the Trojans’ goal for the next four games is simple.
“We just want to win,” senior cornerback Shareece Wright said. “We know it’s not going to be easy, but we want to win.”
A victory in Tucson, Ariz., would certainly be a strong statement in this up-and-down season, but it won’t come easy. The Wildcats are talented on both sides of the ball.
Quarterback Nick Foles leads Arizona’s offense. Foles has completed 71.8 percent of his passes this season, by far the best in the Pac-10. His top target is receiver Juron Criner, who also leads the conference with 58 receptions. Perhaps more importantly for USC, Criner caught the game-winning touchdown against the Trojans last year at the Coliseum.
Wright said stopping the Wildcats’ aerial attack will be the Trojans’ biggest challenge, but Arizona also moves the ball on the ground behind the two-pronged attack of running backs Keola Antolin and Nic Grigsby.
Arizona’s offense relies on quick passes to Criner and fellow receivers David Roberts and David Douglas. Together, they make up a receiving corps that will test a young USC secondary that is 114th in the nation against the pass.
Wright knows what to expect.
“They throw the rock,” he said.
Wright spoke earlier in the week about the Trojan defense having confidence against the favored Wildcats. If they come in prepared, the formula is simple.
“We’re going to have to just contain their running back and slow down their passing game,” Wright said.
When its defense has faltered against high-powered offenses, USC’s offense has been able to keep the Trojans in games. That will prove difficult against Arizona, which boasts the conference’s best scoring defense, yielding only 17.4 points per game.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley and the Trojan offense will be tested. The good news for Barkley is freshman receiver Robert Woods should be back to full-strength by Saturday.
Woods was hospitalized last week because of severe back pain and vomiting.
He played against the Sun Devils on Saturday but was ineffective, catching only three passes for 18 yards.
The Trojans have experienced huge drop offs when either Woods or team-leading senior receiver Ronald Johnson have been at less than full strength.
“Hopefully both guys will be 100 percent going into Saturday,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said.
Junior running back Marc Tyler should also return to the lineup. Tyler came off the bench and led the Trojans on the ground with 119 yards last week, but left the game with an ankle injury.
Freshman running back Dillon Baxter, who started his first career game last week, could start again depending on how Tyler feels on game day. 
With the season more than two-thirds over, USC would like to build on a strong win over Arizona. Even though the Trojans can’t win the Pac-10 or go to a bowl game, Wright said there are valuable lessons being learned by his young teammates.
“For the guys that are going to come back next year, they’re learning too,” Wright said. “They’re learning how to compete when it’s not easy.”
FIGHT ON TROJANS…BEAT THE WILDCATS!!!!!

The third-place Women of Troy have only lost one game at the Galen Center this year, and they are hoping that number remains the same when they play their final home matches of the season this weekend.
With just five games left in the regular season, the No. 6 USC women’s volleyball team is trying to rack up every win it can to move up in the Pac-10 standings.
USC will host No. 20 Arizona tonight before facing Arizona State on Saturday.
“It’s important that we have wins in the next few weeks, but certainly we want to win at home,” USC coach Mick Haley said.
Friday’s match puts USC up against a team it has already defeated this season. The Women of Troy knocked off the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., last month. But Arizona is very hungry for a win and might not be easy to beat a second time.
“Arizona’s trying to move into our slot and get into the hunt to be one of the top three teams in the conference,” Haley said.
On Saturday, USC will play an Arizona State team that is only 11-14 overall and 5-7 in the Pac-10. But the Women of Troy are not taking the Sun Devils lightly, especially since they upset USC earlier this season in Tempe, Ariz.
“They’re playing actually better now than they played before, and we’re going to be at home, so I expect us to be much more focused also. So, it should be an interesting, interesting battle,” Haley said.
Even with the improvement of the Sun Devils, Haley still believes his team is capable of winning Saturday’s match, as long as the Women of Troy limit their mistakes.
“If we restrict the number of free points that we give to them with our errors, they’ll have a hard time beating us. But if we give them points, it’s going to be a very close game,” he said.
Last weekend, USC knocked off then-No. 2 California for the second time this season before losing to then-No. 3 Stanford. While Haley claims his players have given a lot of effort this week in practice, it seems the loss might still be hanging over their heads.
They’re really upset about not being able to play well against Stanford,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy are hoping to avoid a repeat of last weekend, not only because they want to improve their record but also because Saturday night’s game has an additional significance.
USC’s match against Arizona State marks Senior Night for three USC players. Middle blocker Zoe Garrett as well as outside hitters Geena Urango and Kimmee Roleder will all be honored for their contributions to the team throughout their college careers.
“It’s always hard because you have kids for four years or five years, and you know it means it’s their last home match and last time they’re going to put that uniform on at home unless it’s the NCAA tournament, so it’s always really special,” Haley said.
Both of USC’s matches this weekend will be at 7 p.m.

At an event hosted by the Institute of Sports, Media & Society on Thursday night, students, faculty and six panelists discussed the media’s role in reporting sports accurately and what can be done to provide a stronger moral compass within journalism.
Good sport · Pat O’Brien, host of Fox Sports Radio, encouraged students to research and report thoroughly at the panel on Thursday. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
Panelists included Scott Boras, considered Major League Baseball’s “super agent,” whose clients include New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, Washington Nationals rookie phenomenon Stephen Strasburg and Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Jayson Werth.
While on the panel, Boras said journalists working on deadline rush too much, and the time factor contributes to poor work.
“The cake is never cooked; we’re getting pudding,” Boras said.
Tara Lipinski, the youngest individual gold medalist in the history of the Olympics who won the gold medal in figure skating at the 1998 Nagano Olympics, was also on the panel.
“I grew up in sports. To me it’s the most important thing in the world, and to be able to have kids going to school have this opportunity, I think it’s really great,” she said.
Lipinski gave an athlete’s point of view, saying her only option to avoid media scrutiny was to be cautious in all aspects of her life.
Lucia Florindez, a graduate student studying communication management who attended the event, said she thinks ethics is a critical parts of the sports industry.
“It’s interesting how ethics can play into a sport narrative because I think sports largely are narrative stories and every athlete has a story to tell,” Florindez said.
Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism Dean Ernest Wilson spoke to a smaller group before the event at the University Club about his plans for the institute.
“I’ve never seen an initiative take off vertically before,” Wilson said.
He predicted that in three years, USC and Annenberg will have the most robust sports media and society program of any university in the world.
Moderator Pat O’Brien, an entertainment and sports broadcaster, criticized the media and encouraged students to do research and report accurately.
“How do you wade through the crap out there when 90 percent of it is wrong?” he said.
During the feedback portion of the event, attendees asked about the future of the journalism industry, which many said was negative and clouded in gossip.
Among the suggestions, panelists told prospective journalists to be patient while reporting, to inform themselves about the subject and to distinguish morality from popularity.
Sports, Media and Society is now a minor at Annenberg. The institute plans to add more speaker series’ and a summer institute for athletes transitioning from professional careers to life beyond the field or court.

Beginning this weekend, two young teams will suit up under the USC basketball moniker, with a total of four scholarship seniors on the men’s and women’s teams and multiple freshmen ready to play big roles on both squads.
It is fitting then that both of the teams’ broadcasters will be young and new as well.
Chris Fisher, 25, is the new voice of the Trojans on ESPN Radio 710 AM. Fisher, who graduated from USC in 2007 with a degree in political science and three years of experience calling minor-league baseball across the nation, took over the play-by-play position in July after spending one season calling women’s basketball for USC. He takes over for the late Rory Markas, who died of an apparent heart attack in January.
Taking over Fisher’s vacated post with the women is Jason Schwartz, a 22-year-old Los Angeles native who graduated from USC in May with a degree in broadcast journalism and has called two seasons of summer-league baseball in the Pacific Northwest.
Collectively, the duo represents a big step for USC hiring two young broadcasters with Trojan connections. Add up their two ages and you might come close to the age of a normal basketball play-by-play man at most schools across the nation.
“We’re somewhat in the same boat,” Schwartz says, adding that the two have known each other since they were students. “We’re both going into unfamiliar territory. Even though he did women’s basketball, obviously jumping up to men’s is completely different and, being on ESPN radio, there’s a lot that goes with that.”
Both will make their respective debuts this weekend — Schwartz tonight at the Galen Center against Gonzaga and Fisher on Saturday against UC Irvine, also at home. And their first road trips aren’t far away either, with Schwartz and the women traveling to Cameron Indoor Stadium for a big test at Duke on Monday — a game Schwartz says he’s been excited for “since before I got the job.” Fisher and the men’s squad heads to Massachusetts next weekend for a preseason tournament, with other nonconference trips to Nebraska, Kansas and Tennessee scheduled in the next month.
Both will be calling every game for the teams, who each have the potential to qualify for the NCAA tournament. The women’s squad was close to getting in a year ago, as it was the first team out of the bracket of 64 left out. Analysts said they were snubbed; USC coach Michael Cooper compared finding out about it to losing to the Boston Celtics in the NBA finals as a Los Angeles Laker.
But the Women of Troy are predicted to be the third-best team in the deep Pac-10 conference this year, a finish that would almost assuredly earn them a spot in the Big Dance.
“Personally, I’m very excited for the prospects for the team this year,” Schwartz said. “Obviously any time a coach is in his second year, things are going to be better, and I think they have awesome leadership. The fact is, they didn’t really lose very many players. And what they lost, they’ve definitely made up for.”
Schwartz is right. USC returns its two top players from a season ago in stud juniors Briana Gilbreath and Ashley Corral, most of its top players, and adds two nationally known freshmen in Cassie Harberts and Len’Nique Brown.
The men’s situation is a little different. The Trojans lost a lot, with three starters — Mike Gerrity, Dwight Lewis and Marcus Johnson — graduating, but they will benefit from an actual incentive this time around.
Remember, USC banned itself from postseason play last January just as the Trojans were hitting their stride. The NCAA tourney — and the National Invitational Tournament, for that matter — are up for grabs this season, and Kevin O’Neill’s squad has set a firm goal of reaching postseason play.
And O’Neill just might have the talent to do it, with two star freshmen of his own in Bryce and Maurice Jones. Combined with returning forwards junior Nikola Vucevic and senior Alex Stepheson, and the much-improved senior Marcus Simmons, the Trojans will surely be in the mix.
“They’ve got some key guys at some spots that they haven’t had in the past,” Fisher said. “ They’ve got a point guard this year that they’re going to have from start to finish. They’re going to have one of the best frontcourts in the country with Vucevic and Stepheson, and they’re going to be rebounding machines. And when they get [Fordham transfer] Jio Fontan back, if they get solid production from those guys, they’ve got a chance to make a run at some things.”
Fisher will be along for the ride, as will Schwartz.
“Who knows whether or not they’re going to make the NCAA tournament or how well they’re gonna do in the Pac-10 tournament, but I think that this team has the potential to make some noise and re-establish itself as a Pac-10 player,” Fisher said. “They’ve got some interesting things they can present.”

A USC School of Cinematic Arts student was honored with a Princess Grace Award for his work in film and digital animation on Wednesday at a gala in New York City. Willie Williams, a graduate student studying animation and digital arts, is one of 21 emerging artists from a variety of fields including theater, dance and film that received an award.
The award was presented by the Princess Grace Foundation, a not-for-profit organization established by Prince Rainier III of Monaco in honor of his late wife, Princess Grace Kelly, a well-known supporter of the arts and former Hollywood movie star.
Williams received a $7,002  scholarship — the amount Williams estimated his thesis project would cost — from the foundation to fund his thesis film project, titled Our Legacy, as part of the award.
“Award recipients are chosen through a panel process by professional experts in each of the three categories. They get together and watch all of the submissions and then ultimately decide who deserves an award,” said Christine Kite, communications manager for the Princess Grace Foundation.
Williams, who received his BFA from Texas A&M-Kingsville and is currently enrolled in the MFA animation and digital arts program at USC, said he was completely surprised to find out he won an award.
“I had no idea I was going to win the award. I’m competing against people from across the nation, kids who study at schools like the California Institute of [the] Arts, who are all doing interesting films,” Williams said. “In my mind it was a shot in the dark if I was going to actually win.”
Williams said he started his career in fine arts as a printmaker, forging stills that conveyed a story through a single image. Upon suggestions from his friends and colleagues, he made the transition into filmmaking, focusing on digital animation.
“I definitely did my research when I started thinking about film school. I narrowed it down to a couple of schools, but I ended up choosing USC because you can’t beat the faculty here as well as the availability of all the different types of departments in the film school,” he said.
Williams was also a finalist in the 2010 Coca-Cola Refreshing Filmmakers Competition for storyboards and layout for his work My Hero. He also screened his first animated film Sold at the Director’s Guild Theater in Hollywood in May. He said he hopes to open his own studio after completing his studies.
“I want to employ fresh talent in the industry so that they can have a chance to spread their wings,” Williams said. “My studio would ultimately be geared towards animation, but obviously some knowledge of live-action films is essential as well.”
Williams said he attributes his successes to the opportunities given to him at USC.
“Going to USC film school was something I saw that I could capitalize on. The faculty here means everything to me,” Williams said. “They are truly amazing and the best part of the school, in my opinion. They make me love what I do.”
Kathy Smith, chair of the John C. Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts at SCA, said the school could not think of a more deserving artist for the award.
“He has worked extremely hard the past two years while studying at SCA, taking on numerous campus jobs to help support his career and studies,” Smith said in an e-mail. “We are very grateful to the Foundation for their support of our students and in particular for the creative space and financial relief it will allow Willie on his thesis project.”

Unstoppable [rated PG-13]
A fast traveling, unmanned freight train carrying poisonous gas and other nasty chemicals is on a crash course with a small blue-collar town in the newest Tony Scott action thrill ride. It is up to the experienced railroad company engineer (Denzel Washington) and a young conductor (Chris Pine) to put a stop to the train before it’s too late. Unstoppable marks Washington’s fifth collaboration with Scott.
Morning Glory [rated PG-13]
Notting Hill director Roger Michell gathers a top-notch cast, including Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton, Jeff Goldblum and Rachel McAdams, for his comedy about a waning television morning show. Ford plays the grumpy morning show host Mike Pomeroy who is constantly feuding with co-host Colleen Peck (Keaton). Young producer Becky Fuller (McAdams) is assigned the impossible task of launching the show back into the top of the charts. J.J. Abrams lends his storytelling expertise in a producing role on the film.
Skyline [rated PG-13]
Los Angeles is the victim of an apocalyptic alien invasion in this sci-fi thriller. Brothers Greg and Colin Strause fully financed the $10-million production budget and shot the entire picture on the innovative, high-tech Red cameras in their hope to further advance the special effects of the alien invasion genre. If the trailers are anything to go by, they definitely got the visual aspect of the film down pat.

California’s chief budget analyst announced Wednesday that the state is projected to face a $25.4 billion budget deficit for the next fiscal year, a figure that is much larger than what state officials were predicting just days ago.
According to the report from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, the deficit projection is a result of a combination of recent legislation, budget restrictions passed by voters, and predictions of a “painfully slow economic recovery.”
The projected deficit amounts to about 29 percent of this year’s general fund budget, and will require several years of deep cuts and more tax collections to close.
State Republicans have committed to blocking any proposed tax increases, while Democrats have vowed to protect core programs and jobs, setting the stage for the possibility of more budget problems in the future.

Standout Auburn quarterback and Heisman hopeful Cam Newton has been embroiled in scandal regarding whether he and his family orchestrated a “pay-to-play” plan, thus leading Newton to receive improper benefits under NCAA rules. Most SEC teams were recruiting Newton — who left Florida after one year following an alleged cheating incident — including the Tennessee Volunteers, at the time led by now-USC coach Lane Kiffin.
Kiffin came on record Wednesday saying that the Newton family never brought up a “pay-to-play” plan with him, and that he never offered Newton a scholarship because he “didn’t fit the system.”
Kiffin also said that he “doesn’t think there are any facts to [reported news] until someone shows proof. [The accusations] a perfect example.”
ESPN and The New York Times first broke news of Newton’s controversy last week when former Mississippi State quarterback John Bond said that agent Kenny Rogers sought money in order to guide Newton to Mississippi State. Rogers said on Thursday to ESPN Radio that Newton’s father, Cecil, was the one who wanted money and requested $100,000 to $180,000.
Newton has passed for 1,890 yards and 19 touchdowns, while also rushing for 1,146 yards and 15 touchdowns, making him the favorite to win the prestigious Heisman Trophy. However, after the Reggie Bush scandal, the Heisman Committee might be hesitant to hand the award over to another player who is in the middle of a very messy situation.

As Arthur Conan Doyle aficionados across the globe await the return of Guy Ritchie’s enthrallingly modern vision of the Great Detective in Sherlock Holmes 2, it would seem that Rachel McAdams (Irene Adler in the first film) is second-guessing reprising her role in the sequel. More confounding still is the fact that production has already begun on the sequel and McAdams remains in limbo.
Alfred Hitchcock — the notorious neurotic of pre-production, who unfortunately never helmed a Sherlockian adventure — is likely rolling over in his grave, as Ritchie carries on with an uncertain and unstable production of Sherlock Holmes 2. Ritchie does not have the same control-freak style of direction as Hitchcock; in the production of the first film he, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law spent much of the production tweaking the script to make it more adaptable Holmes universe.
Nevertheless, the fact that one of the Ritchie’s key players is still deciding whether or not she will even appear in the film is a horse of a different color. From what sources have leaked so far, it would seem that such a divorce would not halt production or impede Ritchie’s creative process, but it does tell us something about the way films are made today.
Call it an organic process or an idiotic one, 2009’s Sherlock Holmes was slick, smart and cohesive, and more than likely the sequel will not exhibit any glimmers of a rushed production when it finally hits the big screen.

According to researchers at the University of Washington, American college students who study abroad are likely to increase — even triple — their alcohol consumption while traveling internationally.
Students over the age of 21 doubled their intake of alcohol from an average of four drinks per week on campus to eight drinks per week abroad, according to a study published in the October issue of Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. The overall increase in surveyed students’ alcohol consumption was 105 percent, while those underage students tripled their drinking with an increased consumption of 170 percent.
In the spring semester, many USC students will jet off to study abroad. These travelers must consider how their drinking habits might change while living in a foreign country.
As evidenced by wraparound lines at popular venues including Figueroa Street’s 901 Bar & Grill and the frequency of alcohol-fueled tailgate parties during game day, USC students are accustomed to a culture where most social events are punctuated with alcohol and drinking games.
And although they might not heed the university’s advice, most students are educated regarding the size of a standard drink and responsible drinking practices. Tools such as AlcoholEdu, an online tutorial that incoming freshmen are required to complete, aim to increase awareness and eliminate extreme drinking behavior on college campuses.
However, knowledge of a beer’s alcoholic content has proved insufficient information for students to apply safe drinking habits during their semesters abroad.
By consuming alcohol in excess, particularly in an unfamiliar country, the risks for students are greater than those traditionally associated with a night of drinking at USC.
Though instances of injury, crime and sexual abuse do occur as a result of binge drinking at USC, such severe ramifications are comparatively rare within the university’s party culture. Some of the more prevalent woes are students who slept through class because of a hangover or ruined a cell phone by jumping in a pool.
But students who travel abroad must take additional precautions as the heightened risks include becoming lost, getting pick-pocketed or otherwise taken advantage of.
The Washington study revealed that drinking increased most dramatically in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Those students who perceived that their peers were drinking more heavily also reported consuming more alcohol themselves, and those who planned to drink to experience international culture did so.
The Washington study surveyed 177 students before their departure and after their return to the United States. The majority of these students doubled their drinking while abroad, but most returned to an average of three to five drinks per week when they returned to Seattle.
Still, many students who drank the most while abroad — students under 21 — seem likely to return to the college campus drinking more heavily than when they left.
“That speaks to how there may be lasting changes in drinking behavior,” said Eric Pedersen, a University of Washington graduate student studying psychology and a researcher in the study.
Despite the reported increase in alcohol consumption, students at USC said that their binge drinking decreased while studying abroad. Juniors and seniors who traveled internationally explained that they would drink a glass of wine with dinner, which raised the count for their number of drinks per week, but that they did not become intoxicated while abroad as often as they would on campus.
“I would say that my drinking habits didn’t change and they might’ve gotten less, if anything,” said Katie Barbaro, a senior majoring in occupational therapy who studied abroad through a summer program in France. “I wasn’t looking to party every night. When I drank it was once a week in moderation as opposed to one big party at USC.”
Many USC students who studied abroad also agreed that potential risks from increased drinking should not discourage their peers from studying abroad.
“If you’re going to develop a drinking problem you’re going to develop it either way,” Barbaro said. “Maybe the availability of drinks [in Europe] makes it earlier onset, but it shouldn’t be a concern for students who want to study abroad.”
Students might even utilize these nightlife experiences as a form of cultural immersion.
“It’s not necessarily about going out and drinking. I just want to see the people,” said Alexander van der Hoek, a junior majoring in cinema-television production who studied in four European cities with Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism’s  International Communication Studies program.
“I want to see the kind of music they play, see the kind of dance styles. Those were my motivations for wanting to go out and experience the nightlife.”
Students traveling abroad this spring should try to do the same.

Global warming has been a perennial point of contention among politicians and scientists for the last decade. Though it’s debatable whether politicians should be so vocal about their opinions on an otherwise purely scientific matter, there has been no shortage of political discussion on the topic.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Such debates are usually emotionally charged — and for good reason. A strong belief in the veracity of global warming can lead to the redirection of a good portion of state and federal budget toward research on the subject, technology for sequestration of greenhouse gases and regulations on energy use.
On the other hand, if the government presumes it to be untrue when it isn’t, the planet might be too far gone for anything productive to be done.
But for us average Americans, the existence — or absence — of genuine climate change shouldn’t hold too much sway over our actions. Responsibility toward our environment should be practiced regardless of this single negative consequence.
Not only are there other consequences to be considered — exhaustion of nonrenewable resources, pollution of the atmosphere, destruction of our environment — but we should arguably maintain the health of our planet simply because it’s the right thing to do.
Despite decades of exhaustive efforts by astronomers, until we find another planet suitable for sustaining human life and figure out how we are going to transport a few billion people — and our stuff — 25 light years through space, we’d better take care of our little corner of the universe.
So what does real ecological responsibility look like in our daily activities? Recycling, for one; switching to electric vehicles when it’s feasible; and general round-the-house conservation practices such as turning off the lights and not running the faucet while brushing your teeth.
We should also implement conservative practices at the university level. Electronic assignment submissions save paper, ink and organizational energy. Similarly, distributing handouts online when possible will also conserve resources.
USC is starting to take strides toward conservation. For instance, our campus is going to be a guinea pig for the new Smart Grid technology, which involves power monitoring based on patterns of use. Not only will we be contributing to a new and innovative body of research, but we’ll also be the first to benefit from the efficiency and practicality of the new system.
The important thing to note is that being green saves us money both in the short and long-term. We pay for the energy and resources we use, so if we live more conservatively we’ll spend less by consequence.
Granted, as with the Smart Grid and electric vehicles, initial implementation costs might seem overwhelming, but in most cases, if not all, the technology pays for itself in a relatively agreeable time period.
The same goes for the actions of the government. Money spent on development of new energy sources reduces dependence on foreign countries and on a nonrenewable resource. So the path we’re on now — toward clean, renewable energy, and away from oil and the negative impacts that come with it — is an efficient one.
Continued research into global warming is still advisable, but its effects and prevention can be compartmentalized and viewed separately from other green initiatives, which should be pursued on parallel paths.
A shining example is New York’s Bottle Bill, which requires every beverage vendor to maintain machines for container recycling. Since it was passed, it has “reduced roadside litter by 70 percent, recycled 90 billion containers … at no cost to local governments, saved more than 52 million barrels of oil, and eliminated 200,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases each year.”
The beauty of the system is that it’s in the consumers’ best interest to be green — they’re taxed when buying recyclable goods, but they get this deposit back if and when they bring the goods back for recycling. And though our sense of environmental duty should be enough to spur us toward green behaviors, incentives like this one can’t hurt.
Whether the research ends up proving or debunking global warming, we clearly can’t afford to neglect our responsibility to the earth — either as individuals or through government action.
And hopefully through conserving and exercising good stewardship over our clearly limited resources, we can preserve what we have here for those who follow.

What would you do if you had to relearn your life?
Doll’s life · Hogancamp used toys to help cope with injuries. - Photo courtesy of Cinema Guild Theatrical 
That’s what photographer Mark Hogancamp had to ask after he was nearly beaten to death outside a bar in Kingston, N.Y. Left with no money for therapy and little memory of who he was, Hogancamp built a model city in his backyard to cope with his injuries.
So goes Marwencol, the new documentary from Jeff Malmberg, an alumnus from the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
The film begins with a series of still shots showing bloodied soldiers, army vehicles and men and women embracing, set to the tune of the 1940s hit, “Dream,” by The Pied Pipers. One would think this was the introduction to a documentary about World War II — except for the fact that the figures in the photos are dolls.
Providing us with a glimpse into Hogancamp’s fascinating world, this opening montage of photographs sets the stage for the film. Named for the miniature World War II-era city that Hogancamp built in his backyard, the documentary follows the man as he struggles to decipher the difference between reality and the very realistic scenes he brings to life at a one-sixth scale every day in Marwencol.
Having suffered serious brain damage in his attack, Hogancamp, who was 38 at the time, was forced to relearn how to do almost everything: speak, walk, read, write and — most importantly — use his imagination.
His miniature city serves as the tool to help him relearn himself.
All the things that Hogancamp feels he can no longer do in real life, his alter ego — a transformed G.I. Joe doll — does in Marwencol. He meets countless women, and even falls in love with some of the dolls.
“I was the only man with 27 Barbies,” Hogancamp says proudly to the camera as he narrates the life of his pint-sized likeness.
But much more powerful than the words Hogancamp uses to narrate the lives of all the dolls who live in Marwencol — many of which are very accurate likenesses of Hogancamp’s friends and family — are the photographs he takes. Although he uses the dolls to enact a war story that he writes in his head, he uses a camera to tell that story in a manner so exquisite that Malmberg, among others, knew it had to be shared with the world.
Upon being discovered, some of Hogancamp’s photographs were first featured in a magazine and put on display in a gallery in New York City. Though his growing fame as a photographer takes up an increased amount of the plot as the film progressed, it is the journey that Hogancamp endures as he meticulously sets up each scene — making sure everything from the miniature rifle to the doll’s cigarette is perfectly in place — that is the most intriguing part of the documentary, and Malmberg is able to convey this journey with unfaltering brutal honesty.
Hogancamp wasn’t afraid to show the video cameras who he really is, despite the fact that revealing some of his offbeat antics gets him in trouble at times. At the same time, Malmberg didn’t abuse the privileged plunge into Hogancamp’s life that he was permitted.
Malmberg’s film shows great respect for Hogancamp and his art, depicting the troubled man who does not consider himself an artist as both brilliant and charming. Through its well-thought-out combination of wide shots showcasing Hogancamp’s most powerful photos and his carefully selected pieces of poignant narration, the documentary provides viewers with 83 minutes of pure admiration.
“At the time, we thought we were doing an eight-minute short for our own benefit,” Malmberg said in a panel discussion after Wednesday’s screening of Marwencol at the School of Cinematic Arts’ Albert and Dana Broccoli Theatre. “But as soon as we met Mark, we knew there was a lot more to learn and explore and discover.”
Producer Kevin Walsh, who also participated in the discussion, pointed out a particular photo that he found most interesting: one from the Hogancamp doll’s wedding day.
“They say a picture’s worth a thousand words — well that picture’s worth a thousand questions,” Walsh said.
Many of the photos that Malmberg chose to include leave viewers with this same feeling of bewilderment and amazement, largely because they seem so real.
The way they are positioned, their facial expressions, their interactions with one another — everything about the dolls is so human, including the feelings, hopes and desires that Hogancamp creates for them.
“Everybody has a dream,” Hogancamp says in the film. “Everybody wishes they had a double they could do things that they could never do.”
The film shows a broken man slowly rebuild his life in a unique way. Although his method was unorthodox, he made it work, and Malmberg managed to tell the story in a way that was true to his efforts.
Hi Julianna – Thanks for the kind words about the film and I’m glad you enjoyed the panel discussion!  But as much as I’d like to lay claim to the quote you attribute to me, that pithy observation actually came from fellow producer (and ‘ SC alumnus) Matt Radecki. ;-) – kw

Associate athletic director J.K. McCay told “The Petros and Money,” a sports talk show on KLAC-AM, that the NCAA appeals hearing for USC will “probably” take place sometime in January.
The NCAA’s next scheduled meeting of its Infractions Appeals Committee is set for this week. These meetings occur every other month. The NCAA, however, chooses not to reveal which schools and their cases are on the docket for meetings.
“The NCAA does not release timing or the school schedule for infractions appeals hearings because they are private meetings,” NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn told the Orange County Register. “The school may choose to release that information, but the NCAA national office does not.”
In its appeal, USC asks that certain findings be overturned and penalties lessened. USC filed the appeal to the NCAA on June 25, 15 days after it was sanctioned, asking that its two-year bowl ban be reduced to one year, and that its scholarship penalties be halved from 30 to 15.
If USC’s case were to be heard in mid-to-late January, it would still not guarantee that the committee’s decision would be announced before Feb. 2, National Signing Day. This means that USC coach Lane Kiffin might not know how many scholarships he has to offer at that time.

“It ain’t hip to sing about tractors, trucks or little towns — but this is country music, and we do.”
That’s what Brad Paisley sang Wednesday night at the 44th Annual Country Music Awards, and he could not be more right. Hosted for the third time in a row by Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, this time in Las Vegas, the program remained buoyant as the two hosts kept jokes cracking with musical humor, singing about anything from the floods in Nashville to Lady Gaga.
Miranda Lambert stole the show, winning four out of her nine nominations including Song of the Year, Album of the Year, Music Video of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year.
Lady Antebellum came in second, winning two out of its six nominations including Single of the Year and Vocal Group of the Year.
Highlights included Taylor Swift’s dramatic performance of her new song “Back to December.” The song ended on an oddly humorous note, as she looked a little confused, mouthing “What?” before the curtain came down.
Another highlight was Lambert and Sheryl Crow’s duet of “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” sung as a moving tribute to the country legend and the first woman entertainer of the year, Loretta Lynn.
Actress Gwyneth Paltrow, a newcomer to country music, received a warm welcome when performing a song from her upcoming movie Country Strong.  Although she lacked the vocal power to really make the song work, she kept in tune and had plenty of style and heart.
Brad Paisley closed up the awards ceremony, tearfully accepting an award for Entertainer of the Year.

The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it will begin requiring a change in the warning labels put on cigarette packages and ads.
Cigarette manufacturers will be required to place graphic images that cover half of the package’s front and back. The top 20 percent of ads will be required to contain such images as well.
The FDA will choose from a list of 36 images that include diseased lungs, rotting teeth, people lying in coffins, and myriad other graphic images and accompanying text demonstrating the dangers of smoking, according to the Los Angeles Times.
“We want to make sure every person who picks up a pack of cigarettes knows exactly what the risk is they are taking,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a news conference.
The reason for the shift in cigarette advertising requirements — which is the first major change in a quarter-century — is a concern from federal agencies about smoking trends.
Smoking rates declined from roughly 42 percent in 1965 to less than 21 percent in 2004. Rates have remained at a flat rate since, however, which has prompted federal agencies to take action.
It is estimated that 450,000 Americans die annually because of smoking-related disease, and 8 million suffer from related chronic disease. This places a $100 billion burden on the national economy each year, according to the Times.
The FDA will choose nine images to use by June 22, 2011, and will require cigarette manufacturers to place them on packages by the following Sept. 22.
The ultimate goal is to reduce smoking rates by 12 percent by the year 2020.
“There is still a long way to go to reduce the enormous burden of death and disability, but we can make progress,” said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, FDA commissioner.
