Occupy Wall Street, a protest that began in New York in September, has ignited protests across the United States. Students in cities like Boston, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles have joined the cause, yet the USC campus appears to be missing the excitement.
Two USC students, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street protests, staged a sleep-in in front of Tommy Trojan on Monday, but their fellow Trojans were nowhere in sight.

This trend is not unique to the USC community, according to Daniel Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute. Though young people are often the force behind political change abroad, as demonstrated by the Tunisian, Egyptian and Libyan revolutions, in the United States, older people have taken the reins.
“Unlike the anti-war protests about Vietnam, which elicited a broad base of college student support, today’s wave of protests are focused towards an older generation,” Schnur said.
Schnur suggested most protests seen in this country, such as the Tea Party demonstrations, pertain to an older demographic and therefore have little impact on the USC campus.
“This is not to say that USC students won’t be involved in the future, but right now the issues seem to be targeting other people” Schnur said.
Schnur suggested USC students find other ways to become involved in political and social movements.
“Since I’ve been at USC, I’ve seen students volunteer in community-based activity, which is just as accurate an indicator in political involvement as voter registration and protests,” Schnur said.
USC and its affiliated institutions administer 260 community service programs. These programs serve more than 600,000 people and provide volunteer opportunities for more than 22,000 USC students, faculty, staff and alumni each year. Volunteers contribute more than 900,000 community service hours annually, according to the USC Volunteer Center.
Bertrand Perdomo, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, has protested against issues such as the passage of Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070, which requires immigrants residing in Arizona to carry proper documentation. Perdomo, however, does not consider himself to be politically active in a traditional sense.
“[Protesting] is not our style, as a school and sometimes it’s looked down upon,” Perdomo said. “USC has a great culture of having discussions and panels and I think their approach is discussion-based.”
Perdomo said there are ways to get USC students more involved through open dialogue.
“We need to encourage a dialogue,” Perdomo said. “People need to have an OK environment to say, ‘Hey, look, this is how I view the world.’ I know it’s not that popular among the people here, but this is how I view it and this is why.’”
Perdomo said being on campus can make it seem like national issues don’t affect students.
“USC can sometimes feel cut-off from the outside world,” said Tanja Venstad, a junior majoring in international relations and psychology. “The university is so invested in its own backyard that it is easy to get wrapped up in the USC community and forget about what happens beyond it .”
I didn’t read all the comments below, but I do agree with the general consensus that we’re in a bubble at USC. Although there are many students on campus who are not from wealth, the majority are. University-sponsored discussion panels have a place, but they can’t replace protests.
Those two students who staged the sleep-in should have spread the word better. I would have joined if I knew it was happening. Justsayin’.
Of course USC would be left out of the protest bubble. Most of the kids that go here have no idea what it means to be in financial woes. Most of the men and women who are being protested against are probably the parents of the students here.
People forget USC had its own “sleep-in” protest last year on top of WPH.  Thanks Kasey!
This is my first time visiting this site and agree that USC is in a bubble.
Day Dreamer..
The reason the houses were so expensive is because goverment made the money available through guaranteed loans..  same as education and health care.. But that bubble burst as will the student loan eventually, the bond bubble and so on..  It’s the fault of the goverment and not capitalism or whatever ism you want to apply.
USC student..
There is some truth to that but it applies to maybe like 1% of the student body.. and yeah Fox News is garbage but  is so CNN, MSNBC.. There is nothing different between them or the two major parties except for rheoteric..
What this article doesn’t mention is that this school is filled with the same whiny, spoiled, over-priveliged brats whose parents are profiting from the very same corrupt, elitist financial system that keeps ghettos overflowing; the hungry, hungry; the poor, poor and the rich, rich. I go to school with these kids — most of them don’t watch news besides the back-patting, rah-rah-American, drill-baby-drill drivel that is served to them on Fox News and the Wash Post. They don’t care about enough beyond what frat house will be hosting next week’s kegger. Get over yourselves. If there’s any “dialogue” at USC it’s self-serving and in no way “open”.
What’s interesting about these “Wall Street” protests is the fact that people from all walks of life are finally realizing that the traditional American dream of hard work, home ownership, and a comfortable living is slipping away from the vast majority of Americans.  
Thirty years ago, average Joe Plumber worked hard so that he could buy a home with one paycheck. Today, assuming he can even find work, it takes two paychecks to pay rent for an over-priced apartment.  Joe Plumber of yesteryear saw his $30,000 home increase in value to $500,000+, cashed out the equity and consumed like there was no tomorrow.  Today he finds himself struggling to avoid foreclosure.  
People fresh out of college can only hope to save enough for a 20% down payment to buy Joe’s $500,000 home.  But first they have to pay back those pesky, enormous student loans which will cut into their ability to save for that elusive mortgage loan.  
The banks of “Wall Street” have more homes on their books than they know what to do with.  Realizing their mistake of easy lending, they ratcheted up the requirements to qualify for loans.  There are more sellers than buyers, and many buyers can’t afford, or qualify, for new loans.  But is it their fault that home values increased over the past few decades?  Is it their fault that they found a way to make money selling home equity loans?  Is it their fault that they found other ways to make even more money by selling investments based on the loans?  It’s called capitalism and it’s intrinsic to the American dream.  
Now we see Joe Plumber and college students walking hand-in-hand at these protests, disillusioned and angry that the American dream is just that, a dream.

As Internship Week ends, many students have worked to secure part-time positions to gain work experience and boost their resumes.
Students must be careful, however, to maintain their GPAs if they add an internship to their schedule during the school year, according to Career Center Executive Director Carl Martellino.
Studious · Uzair Chaudhury, a freshman majoring in business administration, hits the books. Maintaining a high GPA while interning requires managing time well. - Engie Salama | Daily Trojan
“You need to have your grades high and you need to have your internships too,” Martellino said. “If students were letting their grades go in lieu of internships, then if they decide to go to grad school it will hurt them.”
Maggie Burkhead, who received a bachelor’s degree in communication in 2011, said she had internships during the school year at a public relations company and at a television production company. She said taking classes while working made her feel pressured.
“I remember being really stressed out about how I was going to do both,” Burkhead said. “My first internship was really demanding because I was doing things outside of work. I never changed my courseload, but I certainly got stressed out trying to manage my time in the most efficient way.”
Burkhead said she wished she had received more advice on how to manage her time.
“One class in particular definitely did suffer just because the work I needed to do for the class always coincided for things I needed to do for the internship,” Burkhead said. “My grade got bumped down a few points, mostly as a result of me not knowing how to manage my time better.”
On the other hand, Mike Sullivan, a senior in public relations and cinematic arts critical studies, said his GPA improved when he had an internship at Variety last fall.
“The internship sort of breathed some kind of vitality in my activities,” Sullivan said. “I was more driven to get things done. I don’t know if that specifically bled over into my schoolwork, but I was more driven during that semester.”
Martellino said there are several ways for students with internships during the academic year to manage their time, including regular exercise and time management.
“There is no simple answer,” he said. “We always recommend that students take some time for health, exercise and taking breaks. By trying to be strategic with work, student can make sure not everything piles up because that might be overwhelming.”
He said students can group classes so one full day has no classes or do part of their internship online to lessen travel time for an off- campus internship.
“I don’t think there is necessarily any easy answer,” Martellino said. “It becomes the way real life is going to be after graduation. Balancing commute, family, life and a full-time job is not unlike what the rest of real life looks like.”
Diana Tay, a sophomore majoring in English and communication, takes classes only in the morning so she can go to her internships at Fox and ABC during the afternoon.
“It’s easy to handle because I’m the type of person who likes to be busy all of the time,” Tay said. “Last year I planned my schedule in a way so I could do internships.”
Tay said she hasn’t had trouble with time management.
“I enjoy it because it keeps me busy,” Tay said. “If I didn’t have an internship, I would be sitting in my room watching TV anyway, so it’s kind of for my own benefit.”
Martellino said having an internship while classes were in session could be a good thing because many internships relate to students’ majors.
“Having [an internship] as a part of the course work is great [because] you can apply that to the real world and bounce it around with peers, and that has tremendous value,” Martellino said.
Sullivan said his internship experience added to what he learned in school.
“The experience I’ve had has been more valuable to me after what I’ve learned in school,” Sullivan said. “I learned by example what it is to be a good publicist or bad publicist by having to deal with good and bad publicists.”
Learning to balance the demands on your time is part of the value of taking on an internship while in college.  As an alternative to interning for a corporation, consider an internship with a service organization.  There are many communications and PR opportunities available and the service organization would be extremely grateful for the help.

USC will host the Voto Latino Power Summit in February, a two-day event for young Latino voters nationwide, it was announced Wednesday.
Voto Latino aims to “educate, empower and engage” young Latinos to become active in the politics of their community. Voto Latino is a national bi-partisan organization founded during the 2004 election to increase Latino voter turnout.
The event will serve as the launch of Voto Latino’s the 2012 election campaign. The summit will bring more than 200 prominent Latino leaders to campus.
“Our objective is to register voters and empower people to be active participants in our democracy,” said Mary Moreno, communications director of Voto Latino. “We want people to have a greater ownership of their government.”
Voto Latino, headquartered in Washington D.C., chose the USC campus as the venue for the summit because of its location in Los Angeles and young demographics.
“We knew we wanted to work in Los Angeles and with university students,” Moreno said. “This is because college students are effective activists and are very motivated. Our goal is to appeal to young people and get them involved in mobilizing people to the polls.”
The summit will provide workshops for attendees with topics including public speaking, art and activism, civics, voting rights, national and local legislation, corporate social responsibility and grassroots organizing.
“Voto Latino particularly aims to train young Latinos to utilize Internet and mobile activism to more effectively participate in the political landscape,” Moreno said. “The concept behind the event is that attendees will emerge from the summit better informed and ready to train others in their communities.”
Though specific dates and campus locations have not yet been set for the Power Summit, Voto Latino is working with the USC Latina/o Student Assembly to coordinate the event and generate interest among the student body.
Steven Almazan, executive director of USC Latina/o Student Assembly, said in an email it is important for members of the Latino community at USC to engage in politics.
“It is vitally important for USC Latino students to get involved with Voto Latino’s campaign because it will send a message to Latinos outside of the USC community to become social advocates in their own community,” Almazan said.

After a tough stretch at home, it doesn’t get any easier for the Women of Troy.
The USC women’s soccer team (3-9, 0-3) will head to the Bay Area for the next stretch of Pac-12 competition.
Ending a six-game losing streak and securing the team’s first conference victory won’t be an easy task. First up for the Women of Troy is No. 1 Stanford, followed by unranked California, who has received votes in the national polls in recent weeks.
Optimistic · Senior midfielder/defender Ashli Sandoval believes USC can snap its recent slide if it forgets about the pressure surrounding the team. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
“We’ve watched film on Stanford,” senior midfielder/defender Ashli Sandoval said. “They really like to attack on offense. That’s how they win games. It’s going to take a solid effort to stop them.”
Though USC has struggled, Stanford (11-0-1) is playing better soccer than any team in the country. The Cardinal has won 11 of its 12 games, with the only blemish on its record coming in a 0-0 double overtime tie at Maryland on Aug. 26. Since then, Stanford has outscored its opponents 27-2, winning nine straight games.
The Cardinal is also working on a streak of six straight shutouts, which spells trouble for a USC team that has found trouble scoring goals.
“We’ve been working hard this week on our descent, our attack,” Sandoval said. “We’re going to try and increase the pressure. Hopefully we are able to capitalize on the chances that we get.”
Cal also presents a challenge for USC. After a three-game road trip, the Golden Bears (8-3-1) return home to Berkeley, where they are 4-1 on the season.
“We haven’t seen much on Cal, but we know they’re good,” Sandoval said. “We just have to come out and play our best ball no matter who it is.”
That strategy might be an effective one for the Women of Troy. After beginning the 2011 season ranked No. 25 in the country, USC has been victimized by several close, difficult losses and is at the bottom of the Pac-12. Sandoval said that, with less pressure on the team, they might perform like it is capable of performing.
“We have nothing to lose,” Sandoval said. “We don’t want to lose, and I think we can be a great team. I think without all the pressure we can win some games.”
After USC’s latest one-goal defeat, Khosroshahin expressed similar sentiments.
“We’re going to keep kicking it,” he said. “We have to forget all the other stuff and just play.”
USC’s match against top-ranked Stanford kicks off at 7 p.m. tonight. The Women of Troy will have an off day before taking on California at 1 p.m. on Sunday.

After the Trojans were forced to withdraw from the Kikkor Golf Husky Invitational in Bremerton, Wash., because of rain, the No. 8 USC men’s golf team tees off Sunday in the hopes of winning The Prestige event.
USC had eight scheduled holes remaining and was among 10 schools, including Oregon, UC Davis and University of Pacific, to withdraw from the Husky Invitational. The Trojans will enter another event looking to fulfill the missing rounds lost at the invitational.
“Even though it was rained out and we would have liked to play in it, it is not over-bearing,” junior Martin Trainer said. “We prepared like we usually do, practice hard and be ready for the next tournament.”
This weekend USC will head to La Quinta, Calif., to compete in The Prestige. The invitational runs from Sunday through Tuesday at the PGA West golf course.
The notoriety of the course does not frighten the Trojans.
“We get a practice round before each tournament,” Trainer said. “We get to map out the course and see what are the good and bad spots.”
Trainer also noted that, although the course might change week-to-week, the preparation remains the same.
“Stanford is a very good team, as usual, and they will be tough to beat throughout the year,” Trainer said. “We can’t worry about what others are doing. We just have to do what we do best, which is try to shoot low scores.”
Despite inclement weather that might be awaiting the Trojans and competition against some of the top teams in the nation, Trainer the team just has to be ready, no matter the circumstances.
“Golf is a mentally demanding sport and you have to be prepared for anything,” he said. “Being on a course for five hours under pressure can wear you out mentally.” The Trojans prepare the most for these types of situations.
USC tees off on Oct. 9  at the PGA West golf course in La Quinta.

Coming off a dispiriting weekend with a fourth-place finish at the SoCal Tournament, the Trojans were eager to refocus and put together a complete, four-quarter effort against No. 14 Long Beach State.
On the attack · Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic scored two goals to help lead the Trojans to victory over the 49ers at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
No. 4 USC (10-2) posted a dominating performance Thursday, playing smothering, physical defense and amassing a bevy of field blocks while cruising to a 14-3 victory.
In the waning moments of the fourth quarter, a minor skirmish erupted. After a Long Beach State player became entangled with sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie, the 49er proceeded to punch the Australian in the head twice. Davie, to his credit, resisted the urge to retaliate and quickly disengaged from the frustrated player. Trainers rushed to his aid. As of the end of the match, he was experiencing some mild dizziness.
“We’ve had issues with Long Beach State before,” sophomore driver Nikola Vavic said. “It was kind of obnoxious that, when they’re losing 11-2, they do stuff like that.”
Extracurricular activity aside, the Trojans exhibited why they expect their term as the No. 4 team in the nation to be short-lived. Nine different players found the back of the net, including two-goal games from Nikola Vavic, senior driver Peter Kurzeka, redshirt junior driver Michael Rosenthal, redshirt freshman two-meter Jack Plaga and freshman driver Kostas Genidounias. On the defensive end, when the Trojans’ field players did not block shots, senior goalie Joel Dennerley was customarily strong in net, recording eight saves on the evening.
“To go from No. 1 to No. 4 in the course of one day is pretty hard, so we concentrated on sustaining our attack and we kept them to three goals, which is always good,” sophomore utility Mace Rapsey said.
Rapsey played a particularly strong game, setting the tone in the first quarter not only by scoring with a precise lob shot on the first possession of the game but by recording three steals and drawing an exclusion penalty that led to another Trojan goal.
On a team that sometimes operates so seamlessly that it appears almost robotic, the Trojans came out with more visible intensity in this game, led by USC coach Jovan Vavic who bounded along the sidelines calling defensive schemes and offensive plays.
“He’s generally animated,” Rapsey said. “But he may have seemed a little more [Thursday]than usual.”
Despite the setback at the SoCal tournament, the Trojans showed why their offense is hard to stop at times. Two standout goals, in particular, came in the fourth quarter when redshirt junior two-meter Brian Boswell effectively slam-dunked a ball into the net, while two defenders were draped over him, and sophomore two-meter Connor Virjee fired a laser into the top left corner of the net from long distance.
Certainly, those types of plays were not always executed last weekend.
“A lot of shots didn’t go our way last weekend, and then we got frustrated and got out of our game plan a little bit,” Nikola Vavic said.
USC will continue to bide its time until it gets another crack at Stanford and UCLA. In the meantime, the team knows it must prepare thoroughly for each opponent.
“We need to keep our focus and come together,” Rapsey said. “There are going to be hard times during the season, but you just have to get back on the horse and keep moving forward.”

No USC football this weekend. I might cry.
The connection between junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods is, in a word, beautiful. But I won’t be able to see these Trojans try to break another offensive record Saturday.
What about the high praise showering freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee? I won’t be able to hear that either from USC coach Lane Kiffin.
But no game Saturday probably also saves me from a heart attack the way these first five games have played out.
Despite the criticism and speculation from lamenting fans and students, USC is 4-1 heading into the bye week. It still has a fair share of problems to correct — namely on defense — but wins are wins, and, at this point, that in many ways is all that matters.
With an extra week of preparation before its bout with the Golden Bears in the Bay Area, there is football outside of USC football.
Not only can USC pay attention to game film, but it can also watch other Pac-12 games that have further implications affecting itself and its possible Heisman candidates in Barkley and Woods.
Here’s a viewer’s guide to this weekend sans USC football:
 
Conference positioning in Salt Lake City
 
After disposing of USC and Oregon State at home, Arizona State travels to Salt Lake City for the first time in 34 years and for its first Pac-12 road game.
Picked to finish second behind USC in the South division, the Sun Devils might have their hands full. Their only loss this season came on the road at Illinois and they have lost 10 of their last conference road games. One stat favoring Arizona State, however, is that they have won seven straight meetings against Utah. The two teams, however, have not played each other since 1993. This matchup has conference title implications as well. Though USC cannot compete in the inaugural Pac-12 championship game, it still has a shot at the South division title. The Sun Devils hold the tiebreaker over USC, but a Utah win would give USC an outside shot at taking the division if Arizona State can fall for the first time in Pac-12 play.
 
Root for UCLA?
 
With that said, and as weird as it sounds, I might have to root for the powder blue Bruins this weekend. UCLA stands at 1-1 in conference play, good for third place in the South division behind Arizona State and USC. The Bruins take on Washington State at home Saturday. And if the Bruins, favored by 5.5 points, can win, this would set off a frenzy. Yes, UCLA wins but its win complicates matters halfway through the season.
If Arizona State loses, there would be a three-way tie for first place in the South division among the Trojans, Sun Devils and Bruins. Optimistic? Yes, but anything is possible.
 
Woods’ Heisman watch
 
What more can be said about Woods? The Serra standout has seemingly done it all this year. He broke a USC game-high record with 17 receptions against Minnesota and he fell five yards short of tying the Trojans’ single-game record for receiving yards against Arizona last weekend. Through just five games, he is 10 receptions and 45 receiving yards shy of tying his totals as a freshman. And he already has tied the number of touchdowns he scored last year.
Still, he has not garnered much attention as a possible Heisman candidate.
Other possible wideout candidates playing this weekend include Oklahoma’s Ryan Broyles, Oklahoma State’s Justin Blackmon, Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd and Western Michigan’s Jordan White. Woods, however, is outproducing all of them. The only knock against Woods? Broyles and Blackmon play for national title-contending teams. Voters will surely take that into account if a wide receiver were to be invited to New York at the end of the season.
 
USC might not be playing this weekend, but plenty of storylines are out there affecting the Trojans. If this season were to get any crazier — and it has been quite the ride through five games — Utah and UCLA could make things interesting halfway through the season for USC.
At least I have something to look forward to this weekend.

When a team is in the middle of a six-game winning streak, most coaches are content to keep the starting lineup the way it is to avoid fixing something that’s not broken.
Reinforcement · Sophomore middle blocker Alexis Olgard, who had offseason knee surgery, saw her first action this season last weekend against Colorado. She is now challenging senior Lauren Williams and freshman Hannah Schraer for a starting position. - Daily Trojan file photo
But ahead of this weekend’s conference matchups on the road against Arizona and Arizona State, USC coach Mick Haley is encouraging position battles for three of his team’s six starting spots.
“I’m kind of in a different type of dilemma,” Haley said. “We’ve got good rhythm right now and we’re moving forward, but we can’t just sit pat.”
The No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team (11-3, 6-1) will travel to Tucson, Ariz., on Friday to play the Wildcats (10-5, 2-4), who USC has beaten in eight of the teams’ last 10 meetings. The two losses, however, have come in the last three years and on the Wildcats’ home court.
Afterward, USC will travel to Tempe, Ariz., to play the Sun Devils (4-11, 0-6) on Saturday, who the Women of Troy have also dominated in recent years.
The Women of Troy have won 29 of their last 30 matches against Arizona State, with the lone loss coming last year when the Sun Devils scored an upset at home.
But Haley seems confident enough in his team to spread out playing time during USC’s trip through the Grand Canyon State.
“You could see some changes [in the starting lineup] yet again,” Haley said. “We have to start working in people who have been working hard in practice and keep building the team for December.”
The main spots that could see new faces in the starting lineup are the two middle blocker positions and one of the outside hitter starting spots.
Freshman Hannah Schraer and senior Lauren Williams currently start at middle blocker, but they will be challenged by sophomore Alexis Olgard, who started 25 matches last year and is on the verge of returning to full strength after battling offseason knee surgery and mononucleosis.
“[Olgard] is right on course to be challenging for a [starting spot],” Haley said. “She just has to get her legs, timing and all of that into the speed of the game. We’re playing at a really fast pace right now.”
Meanwhile, sophomores Sara Shaw and Kirby Burnham have been battling all year for the outside hitter starting spot.
“To have someone else pushing you makes you want [to play] even more,” Shaw said. “So it’s good that [Burnham] and I are competing and really fighting for that [starting] spot because we both really want it.”
Shaw took over as the squad’s six-match winning streak started, but Haley said that Burnham has been showing improvement in recent practices.
Lengthy position battles could hurt the chemistry of some teams, but neither Haley nor the players seem worried about that possibility.
“I think competition for positions is healthy, as long as everybody is positive about it,” Haley said. “And so far all of the team members have been great about this.”
The players agreed. The competition for starting positions should only bolster team unity.
“We definitely have interchangeable parts,” Schraer said. “It’s really great now in practice to have more competition for the spots. Overall, that will really strengthen our team. Whoever plays will get the job done.”
USC tips off against Arizona tonight at 7 p.m. and against Arizona State on Saturday at 8 p.m.

Last week I was deeply inspired by the Troy Davis movement — a vast number of people united to reject the murder of someone who many claimed was innocent. This week I am equally motivated by the efforts made by all participants of the Occupy Wall Street movement, a protest rejecting corporate greed, big bank profits and joblessness.
The movement has spread from New York to Boston and to Kona, Hawaii. The Occupy Los Angeles protests have especially hit me since they are here, right in my home, and so close to our campus.
Though I have been touched, I have also been disgusted at the overreaction of New York Police Department. Occupy Wall Street has naturally attracted more participants than other locations around the United States because it is literally the genesis of much of the resentment people feel. On Sept. 24 — seven days into the protest — more than 700 protestors were arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge roadway. NYPD officers said the demonstrators were illegally blocking traffic, and did not have a permit to march.
The arrests were completely unnecessary, and the money spent to book 700 people — just to release them later on in the day, seems to be a manifestation of what we have all been protesting.
NYPD’s response  gives off the impression that this protest is not being taken seriously by law enforcement. It also deters people from participating in protests by showing an unnecessarily vigorous reaction to a peaceful demonstration, and most importantly, it switches attention from the issue toward questioning police honesty.
A video was recently released showing NYPD officers using pepper spray on a group of protestors from Occupy Wall Street. Protestors reported officers walked alongside them halfway into the bridge before any permits or illegalities were mentioned. In essence, protestors feel NYPD lured them into the street with malicious intent.
This police overreaction has come to define a part of the Occupy Wall Street movement that overshadows the original goal of the protest.
The exertion of power overshadows the event at hand. Police force has deterred the light from the issue — corporate greed — and has instead switched focus to police reaction. In turn, it has aggravated tensions between the people and law enforcement.
Police dishonesty is similarly affecting Occupy L.A. Picturing myself trying to explain to my mother why I’m in jail because of a protest scares me. Though it didn’t stop me from attending, I assume that might be the case for some, and that’s devastating.
Protests across the nation should continue, and no other pointless arrests should be made. We must remember to exert power with purpose — not just exert power to simply remind those beneath us we have it.
 
Mellissa Linton is a sophomore majoring in English. Her counterpoint runs Fridays. 
Mellissa,
Would you feel the same way if a large group of people were blocking traffic, did not have a permit to demonstrate, and they were holding picket signs that read “NO MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION’. We have rules in society as to how we voice our discontentment. If these rules are not followed then the police have to intervene. Would you rather have a society where angry people can demonstrate causes that you find reprehensible – and there are no consequences as to how they go about doing it?
We will only grow stronger in our solidarity and we will be heard, not just in New York, but in echoes across the world.
police officer have no reason to use pepper spray on inocent people just because they are part of the protest. NYPD was wrong and those officers should be punish.  We all saw the video . the evidence are very clear. let WALL STREET come down.
Mellissa you are dancing around the issue and you didn’t even know it.  I have been a police officer and I have been through the crowd control/riot training.  Police officers are trained to understand that when you are out numbered by more than 2 to 1 you will lose.  The only way to control a crowd is to move them into restricted spaces (e.g. bridges, tunnels, buildings).  That was the intent of the NYPD.  They moved them onto a bridge to effectively block as many of them in and virtually jail them with minimal threat to the officers.  THEY DID NOT ARREST THEM TO PUNISH THEM!!  They arrested them so they COULD GET THE NAMES/ADDRESSES/PHONE NUMBERS of the marchers in order to identify the organizers and members of the OWS.  Simply put, they wanted information (they would have to get search warrants and a judge — to get it otherwise) and they got it.  Now don’t be surprised if everyone who was arrested doesn’t have the charges dismissed (except those who had warrants).  The NYPD and the NY politicians fully intended to create the situation to get the intelligence they lacked.  Fortunately, OWS is a distributed group without a clear cut leader (it is based on the egyptian uprising which lacked a clear leader for the egyptian security forces to arrest and stop the uprising).  If you haven’t noticed, the OWS no longer demonstrates where the police can force them into a restricted area, a point the leaders of the OWS appear to have learned.

Free speech is one of the most fundamental aspects of United States democracy, and the Occupy Wall Street protests throughout the streets of Manhattan’s Financial District the last two weeks are no exception. Though those who have participated have every right to do so and should be applauded for passionate civic engagement, they must expect law enforcement to step in when they are disrupting day-to-day activities and acting in a potentially dangerous manner.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
Many protesters and their supporters were outraged after more than 700 protesters were arrested last Saturday for swarming the Brooklyn Bridge and blocking an entire lane of traffic for several hours. Seven hundred is undoubtedly a very high number of arrests and will draw attention, but the New York Police Department was justified in making the arrests for the sake of maintaining order and safety. It is just as undemocratic to interfere with other citizens’ lives with the exercise of free speech than it is to block such speech.
When people are breaking the law, they should not expect to be immune from any legal ramifications simply by citing the Constitution. That’s simply poor logic and a lack of foresight on the part of the protesters. Though police might have incited more rage against the government by arresting so many people, at the end of the day the police’s job is to maintain order and ensure safety. We should not fault them for doing their job in a civil manner.
A common misconception regarding the First Amendment is that any interruption of people’s exercise of free speech by the government is a gross violation of one of our most vital constitutional rights. Cases such as the Brooklyn Bridge debacle, however, demonstrate the presence and importance of reasonable time, place and manner.
The reasonable time, place and manner stipulation of the First Amendment allows the government to impose restrictions on the exercise of free speech as long as such regulations are “narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.”
The Supreme Court has consistently upheld reasonable time, place and manner restrictions in First Amendment cases where public order and safety were at stake. One constantly cited restriction is the requirement that protesters at abortion clinics leave a buffer zone so as to allow clinic customers access to the driveway to the clinic (Madsen v. Women’s Health Center). If restrictions such as these can be placed on the exercise of free speech on a smaller scale, then why shouldn’t they be placed on larger-scale protests when they block nearly the entire Brooklyn Bridge?
Yes, 700 people is a very large number to arrest, but in such large groups more authority must be exerted to keep things from turning more chaotic. If that means making more arrests, then so be it.
By no means is telling people not to block traffic flow on major routes of transportation a violation of free speech. It is possible for one to speak his or her mind about what he or she believes and to be heard without inconveniencing and endangering others.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays. 
I am deeply disappointed by this piece and its confluence of ignorance and collusion with our oppressive police state.  My dismay is heightened still more by the fact that it was written by someone majoring in political science.
Shame.
The video and witnesses make it clear. The police, both white shirts and blue shirts, led a group of marchers onto the roadway. At the halfway point that is at a point hundreds of feet above the east river protected from the waters by low vehicular guardrails the police leading the march turned and stopped. Arrests soon began. Question both the reasons for not blocking the roadway at the Manhattan foot of the bridge and for blocking the bridge at the halfway point. Daily Trojan be careful when you editorialize without the facts.
I am not disagreeing with you other than to say the facts are in question.  That being said, to follow on with the authors discussion….  If you want to fully develop your argument you need to look at both sides.  There were several thousand people attempting to march across the bridge.  If the police wouldn’t have stopped in the middle of the bridge and takenSEVERAL hours to arrest and transport the 700 marchers, I would argue that the march would have been over in 2 or fewer hours.  So how much public disruption was created by the marchers (who would have completed the march and dispersed) and how much was caused by the police stopping in the middle of the bridge and arresting 700 and transporting them from a RESTRICTED structure?  I would say 1-2 hours for the march or the actual 5+ hours for the arrests… Which was a greater disruption (I won’t even go into the costs of 700 arrests, transportation to jail, tickets issued, paperwork submitted to the DA and of course the eventual lawsuits that are filed) and cost to the public?

Abe Sylvia’s debut feature, Dirty Girl, could have easily turned out to be one of the worst films of the year. It is cliché-ridden, both in terms of its characters and its plot, and is as thematically and stylistically haphazard as movies come.
But with Juno Temple, destined to be Hollywood’s next it-girl, and promising newcomer Jeremy Dozier breathing life into the lead characters, Sylvia’s otherwise hackneyed film becomes tolerable, even engaging. Dirty Girl stands as a testament to adept acting transcending mediocre writing and direction.
Loosey goosey · Juno Temple plays Danielle, the movie’s “dirty girl,” and gives the film the magneticism and fuel it needs to finish. Temple creates an unforgettable character viewers are sure to get a kick out of. - Photo courtesy of The Weinstein Company
Clearly, Sylvia has a strong personal connection to the material — few would dare set a movie in a place like Norman, Okla., in 1987 without having been there to experience it — but this alone does not translate into a nuanced or human-feeling premise.
During the first act of the film, before the central performances grab hold of the viewer, the script’s vast number of obtuse stereotypes is downright confounding.
Temple’s Danielle is the film’s notorious high school slut, probably because she learned the role from her mother (Milla Jovovich), who neglects her in favor of the latest boyfriend, a Mormon caricature. Dozier’s Clarke is abused by his fundamentalist father (Dwight Yoakam) because of his apparent homosexuality, while his subordinate mother (Mary Steenburgen) sits powerless.
For a good 20 minutes, it seems the movie will simply be one long barrage of cheap-shots at conservative Middle America — a tired mold long before it ever reached Hollywood.
The plot only becomes more painfully conventional once Danielle and Clarke join forces. They are paired for a school project, and days later embark on an impromptu cross-country road-trip in search of Danielle’s biological father.
What happens on the road trip is nothing short of transformational, but not in the hokey story-related way Sylvia intends. It is here the actors take the reigns from their director. Thrust into the vacuum of Clarke’s dad’s car, borrowed without asking, of course, and unshackled by the one-dimensional supporting cast, Temple and Dozier seize the opportunity to turn caricatures into real people.
Temple is downright magnetic, creating an infectious character viewers are sure to enjoy spending time with, despite Danielle’s foul-mouthed, rough-around-the-edges exterior. She barely resembles her real-life self, trading in her British accent for a Southern drawl and her frizzy mane for a straightened, bleach-blonde hairdo. But her star quality is unmistakable. By the end, the viewer is truly invested in Danielle’s pursuit of her father, a real feat for the actress given Sylvia’s anemic development.
Dozier’s future Hollywood prospects are less certain — chubby, 20-something males often end up relegated to supporting parts in Adam Sandler productions — but his work is equally praiseworthy. His role is more difficult than Temple’s, because he is essentially required to play the universal gay stereotype. But Dozier adeptly interprets Clarke’s overly flamboyant image as the character’s way of finally embracing his socially shunned identity — an ingenious approach.
Having strong lead characters, worthy of affection, does the movie wonders as a whole, too. As Danielle and Clarke’s personalities earn the audience’s affections on the road, viewers should be able to accept the seemingly out-of-place, off-the-wall style Sylvia develops as part of the fun.
Supplemented by Steve Gainer’s grainy cinematography, the aesthetic contains elements of a wide variety of exploitation genres, from queer cinema to blaxploitation (even though there are no African-American characters). The soundtrack’s endless barrage of ’80s show-stoppers, which far outdoes Napoleon Dynamite, is also rather amusing.
Needless to say, whatever heavy-handed social commentary Sylvia was trying to vocalize — about homophobia, the outsider in us all, how kids’ life trajectories often mirror those of their parents, etc. — the moral doesn’t have much of an impact because of the film’s shortcomings. But thanks to Temple and Dozier, Dirty Girl makes for an adequate diversion, not the train-wreck it had every reason to be.

As the leaves skitter over the ground and night comes earlier, the thrill of fall hangs in the air. From the Mexican Día de los Muertos to the ancient pagan Samhain, fall is known the world over as a time for the supernatural.
Demonic forces · With the fall season dedicated to ghouls, ghosts and goblins, embrace the horror genre and check out some cult classics and timely terrors — like Drag Me to Hell. - Photo courtesy of NBC Universal
To complete the motif, some turn to horror films. They’re an interesting genre — ghosts, serial killers, possessed children and even evil trees have staked claims as horror villains. And horror films have the paradoxically dual purpose of scaring us silly while providing entertainment.
But just what is the magic formula that congeals into delicious creepy? It depends on the film. Not all horror films are meant to scare. Not all horror films push the same buttons and not all people have the same buttons to be pushed. But for those who want a dark thrill, here’s a breakdown of the labyrinthine carnival that is the horror genre.
More often than not, horror films seem split between supernatural horror and real-life horror. The fear factor of each largely comes down to the viewer. Are you more scared of something imaginary turning out to be real, or of something real fulfilling your worst nightmares?
Back in the ’30s and ’40s, horror films were all about the monsters. Dracula, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein’s Monster, and The Mummy are some of the most classic movie monsters of all time. They were not necessarily scary, but they were exciting.
What made them jump off the screen was advanced (at least for the time) makeup and all-star actors — Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Boris Karloff as the Mummy and Frankenstein’s Monster and Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. Despite their nefarious, lady-grabbing antics, these monsters were charismatic enough to garner some sympathy — even if realizing you actually care about a vicious werewolf getting riddled with bullets is a little weird.
Some films are not outright scary as much as disturbing, inspiring twisted-gut feelings that make you queasy and anticipate nightmares. Few films achieve this as much as 1977’s Eraserhead, a surreal horror that appears to be about a guy and his mutated son who live in an industrial wasteland. Even director David Lynch called it dark and troubling. Deformed babies and disembodied heads are just part of what makes this nightmarish romp so creepy.
If you prefer bad dreams to jumpy scares, check out the 1992 Belgian mockumentary Man Bites Dog, about a loquacious serial killer, and 2003’s South Korean A Tale of Two Sisters, where it’s a toss-up who the biggest monster is — the ghost or the deranged stepmother.
Good supernatural horror, be it demons, ghosts, zombies or Satan himself, often uses fear of the unknown. In 1968’s Night of the Living Dead, the George Romero film that launched the entire zombie genre, the viewer discovers the undead at the same time the protagonists do.
There isn’t much to discover aside from the fact these creatures are hard to eradicate, want your brains and pack a lethal set of chompers. This is often the scariest revelation of a supernatural horror film: knowing all the terrorizer wants is to have you dead, no logic or reasoning necessary.
Asian horror films especially excel at crafting this fear. Japan’s 1998 Ringu (Ring) started the cursed videotape trope. Besides an ominous atmosphere, it’s especially creepy because there’s no placating the nasty, ghostly teenager.
Films with evil people make some feel particularly disconcerted. Serial killers can run rampant, the law can prove powerless and teenagers can act very, very dumb. Michael Myers, from 1978’s Halloween, definitively proved that one didn’t need some fancy resurrection or demonic power to be a killing machine.
And in a twist of this style, the Saw franchise, usually remembered as the granddaddy of the mid-2000s torture porn fad, was more of a horror mystery in its first iteration. The lynchpin of the film was the enigmatic Jigsaw, who justified bloodshed with twisted morality.
Horror films are not always meant to scare, either. Some make us laugh and squirm at the same time. Scream, Wes Craven’s 1996 horror hit, is as campy as it is creepy, and takes the time to satirize the horror genre in between gory dismemberments. Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street make it fun to cheer on Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger as they slaughter rambunctious teenagers.
More recently, Sam Raimi’s Drag Me to Hell feels almost like a straight comedy except for its sardonic demons, a skin-crawling soundtrack and a hate-filled, vengeful gypsy.
Fall is the perfect time to slake a thirst for horror films. In a season dedicated to ghouls and goblins, it feels almost like paying homage — a deference to all the things that exist outside the nice and normal and demonstrate the dark thrill that comes from fear. As the horror genre shows, for whatever terrifies you, someone has probably exploited it in celluloid.

There’s a reason Tim Minchin’s Los Angeles show at Largo sold out Wednesday night: His performances are much better live.
Fans familiar with his satire for skeptics know the strange-looking comedian, musician and actor has broken into the United States primarily through his YouTube page and TV show appearances watched by American Anglophiles and Aussiephiles. He is not, by any means, a studio performer. All of his CDs are of live performances. Still, he comes across even better in the flesh.
Funny skeptic · Much of Tim Minchin’s comedy stems from his promotion of atheism and science. The satricial songs and stand-up he’s posted on YouTube have bought him an audience in the United States. - Photo courtesy of The Gersh Agency
 
His sharp and somewhat dark humor is balanced in his expert musical ability and wry demeanor, generally accompanied by sheepish winks. His charm doesn’t come through as clearly online or on video — which has recently become available to Americans by legal means — as it does when he’s onstage, interacting with the audience.
After telling a joke about a man masturbating during a haircut, Minchin broke the musical ice of his two-hour set with his not-so-subtle, somewhat autobiographical song “Rock ‘n’ Roll Nerd,” from his first album. He elicited extra laughs with exaggerated facial expressions and leers at a particularly enthusiastic male audience member.
Minchin’s musical ability is represented through his catalogue of songs and composition credits — he did get an advanced diploma (an Australian associate’s degree) in contemporary music — but it comes across even stronger live. His clear voice rings true when it has to, but he also messes around, improvising on his jazzier tunes and changing the voicing of his lyrics to draw attention to particular moments.
The acoustics of Largo, a venue Minchin has played six times in the last year, don’t hurt either. The humor in Minchin’s act comes from his lyrics, and every word could be clearly heard in the theatre. The room, with walls draped in dark red and blue fabric and covered with old pictures, cozily embraces a vintage feel that emphasized the vaudevillian nature of Minchin’s act.
One reason Minchin is better live is he doesn’t shy from interacting with the audience. He asked members to sing along to his better-known songs and made coy remarks about a woman with a distinct laugh in the middle of the theater, exemplifying his penchant for live improvisation.
The energy of Minchin’s performance comes through clearly on stage. Though it’s clear he feeds off of his audience’s zeal in recordings, those albums feel like overhead conversations when compared to his live act. Like any performer worth his salt, Minchin made sure his audience felt like his show was just for them.
He also knows how to fill a stage with crowd-pleasers in his cabaret-style act. He jumped around with animated intensity, turned over his piano bench during particularly intense moments of “Darkside,” organically used his suit jacket and wine glass as props and began his show with a nearly-obscene view of his backside, clad in very, very tight skinny jeans.
On Wednesday night, Minchin made sure to mix his well-known songs with ones less-avid fans wouldn’t have heard. He played two of his singles — “The Pope Song” and, as an encore, “White Wine in the Sun” — as well as “Storm,” the beat poem that introduced him to many American fans. Less fervent followers perhaps heard for the first time “Context,” a ballad that sounds rude if you only hear the first verse, and “Thank You God,” in which Minchin cheekily recants his atheism.
The show’s pace was appropriate. It carried a strong rhythm that resonated in the contrast between Minchin’s comedic stories and comedic songs. If Minchin so desired, he could probably turn his music and stand-up into separate acts, but he uses the relationship between his talents to ease the brutality of his societal criticisms and boost the energy of his presence on stage.
Minchin’s tight set showed off his personality and professionalism, so he could please both the ardent and the uninitiated fans. No more Los Angeles tour dates are set at the moment, but those curious about his work can peruse his YouTube or Twitter pages for a taste of his songs. If you prefer skepticism to spirituality, it’s easy to ask for another helping.

Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., passed away Oct. 5 at the age of 56. News of his death dominated global media headlines and the online sphere throughout the day, with tweets tagged as “#RIP Steve Jobs” and “#ThankYouSteve” peaking in the late afternoon and continuing into the evening.
USC students were moved by Steve Jobs’ passing, with many acknowledging just how large of an impact he’s made not just on technology, but on the world.
“The loss of Steve Jobs is a bittersweet tragedy,” said Jasper Lynn, a senior majoring in business. “His ailing health has been a huge issue for him and now that he’s in a better place, we can all sit back and think to ourselves how the digital age has completely revolutionized everything we do.”
“Because of my major, Steve Jobs is an inspiration when it comes to technology,” said Jarrett Chen, a junior majoring in electrical engineering. “He showed us how technology can be of great use to us. So instead of thanking him for what he did for you, thank him for changing the world.”
“The public reaction to his death was what struck me the most,” said Sarah Payne, a junior majoring in business. “The number of people who posted Facebook statuses, uploaded his Stanford commencement address, the amount of photo timelines, etc., all over the Internet is pretty amazing considering this is just a guy who makes electronics. The fact that he was able to become such a visionary and public figure is what is most impressive in my eyes.”
Apple’s homepage changed to announce the news and commemorate Jobs’ life, where it posted the following message: “Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.”
Steve Jobs co-founded Apple along with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Over the course of three decades, he grew the company from its first product, an assembled circuit board called the Apple I, to the innovative iPhone and iPad-producing giant that it is today through his relentless drive for perfection, brilliant creativity and keen eye for beautiful and user-intuitive products.

Following a close victory over Minnesota in the opener, USC hosted Utah in the first-ever Pac-12 conference football game. The Trojans aimed to gain the head-to-head advantage against a team projected to finish in the top half of the South division.
“You kept hoping for a play that would end the game,” said USC coach Lane Kiffin. “I thought our guys came out good again. We’re there. We’re playing really well in all phases of the game. We’re just not putting people away.”
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley echoed similar sentiments.
“We had so many chances to put that game away,” Barkley said. “The defense won this game for us, no doubt about it.”
Positives: Freshman kicker Andre Heidari nailed a 47-yard field goal early in the game and showed his range. Senior tailback Marc Tyler returned from suspension to lift the USC ground game that struggled in the season opener against Minnesota.
He tallied 113 yards on 24 carries and helped establish an offensive rhythm. Most importantly, the defense and special teams came through down the stretch. Utah only notched 319 yards and failed to score in the first and fourth quarters. Junior left tackle Matt Kalil blocked the Utes’ tying field goal attempt at the end of the game and redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris scooped it up for a touchdown to punctuate the victory.
Negatives: As both Kiffin and Barkley alluded to in the post game, the USC offense squandered several opportunities to pull away from Utah. Two fumbles and an interception cut several drives short. The Trojans also committed seven penalties, many of which negated big plays.
