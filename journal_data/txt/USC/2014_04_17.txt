On Thursday, Doheny Memorial Library was transformed for Wonderland Unbound, a multimedia event to showcase works from the USC Libraries’ Cassady Lewis Carroll Collection. Wonderland Unbound is an evening filled with music, food, actors in costume and interactive multimedia events such as visual presentations and scavenger hunts — all central to the theme of Lewis Carroll’s imaginative works.
Down the rabbit hole · USC Libraries celebrated the 10th anniversary of the USC Libraries Wonderland Award at Doheny Memorial Library. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
Wonderland Unbound was sponsored by Visions & Voices to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the USC Libraries Wonderland Award, a multidisciplinary competition in which students create new, scholarly and creative works inspired by the ever-growing Cassady Lewis Carroll Collection.
Tyson Gaskill, executive director of communications and events at USC Libraries, stated that George and Linda Cassady not only donated the collection to USC, but started the award as well.
“They didn’t want the collection to just sit here,” Gaskill said. “They specifically wanted the students to be able to interact with the collection and keep it relevant, keep it fresh.”
Linda Cassady, one of the founders of the collection, said that Wonderland Unbound seemed like a natural fit for the university because Carroll disliked being an adult and was always interested in self-discovery and creativity.
“It’s fun seeing how the rest of the student body responds to Carroll,” Cassady said. “I like the students watching it and participating with it, especially for those who didn’t know much about Carroll’s works before.”
Corona Yu, a freshman majoring in biochemistry, said that she was glad to be taking advantage of USC’s artistic events and enjoyed the free food, animation, actors and decoration.
“It all comes together to seem really like a Wonderland,” Yu said.
Abby Saunders, curator of the Cassady Lewis Carroll Collection, explained that unlike many other universities, USC opens up its special collections to the public.
“We encourage especially students and faculty to come and enjoy [the special collections]. It’s really open,” Saunders said.
Wonderland Unbound shared Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, The Hunting of the Snark and other rare materials from the collection by incorporating all aspects of Lewis Carroll’s genius in unique ways, such as digital animation and massive light projections of Carroll’s famous characters that covered the walls of Doheny. The projection mapping of the library building was done in partnership with 7StarSun.
“7StarSun spent a lot of time with us looking at the collection and coming up with creative ideas that we then tried to massage and focus into the right direction,” Gaskill said.
Tim Stanton, project manager for USC Libraries, explained how he worked those involved with the animations to best exemplify Carroll, who worked not only in literature, but in photography, games and math.
“What we told people was to think of everything Lewis Carroll created, not just Alice,” Stanton said. “To focus on his math, his lesser-known stories, the totality of his work.”
Gaskill discussed how it was to implement new technology and medium in creating Wonderland Unbound as a large-scale multimedia event.
“We’re working way outside of our comfort zone. We have not done something like this before,” Gaskill said.
The façade of the library was transformed through large projections of Carroll’s stories, such as Alice’s adventures and the battle of the Jabberwocky. The event started with 7StarSun’s original productions then shared student productions from USC’s Cinematic Arts graduate students.
Bethany Balchunas, a freshman majoring in archaeology, said that she enjoyed the light projections, which were imaginative and mind-opening.
“I like that the event included student productions. It feels more ‘ours,’” Balchunas said.
Throughout the night, visitors were able to interact with actors in costume, who helped with the augmented reality scavenger games.
“They’re clear, white-looking books with Carrollian phrases,” Stanton said. “You then take a tablet with an app running on it and you roll it over the book to see a feature come up, like a rabbit going down the hole.”
In between the different animations, people were also given the chance to choose which light projections would be shown on the building.
“I think the star of the show will be the tablet,” Stanton said. “There with a tablet, you’re able to manipulate the imagery shown on the building like video jockeys.”
Planning for the event started two years ago to both commemorate the 10th anniversary and celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice ‘s Adventures in Wonderland.
“This is almost like a kick-off event for the anniversary,” Gaskill said.

Impact, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s award-winning television news magazine, debuted its 79th episode Thursday night at its Spring Screening.
Students in Professor Dan Birman’s graduate and undergraduate documentary classes contributed to the four segments, which comprised the 30-minute episode. The segments, which ranged from comical to tragic, highlighted stories of the enduring human spirit.
“It was really all about people making a name for themselves, and pushing ourselves to do something for humanity,” Birman said.
“Instafamous,” the first segment, featured individuals who are using social media to help their careers. The story followed Sunderland, a band which promotes its music on YouTube, an actress who has gained notoriety on Vine and a sketch-comedy group who also posts its content on YouTube.
“It was a modern and edgy piece, and it was definitely the most fun segment to work on. It was my favorite of the entire year,” said Ashley Valez, a first-year journalism graduate student and Impact senior producer.
The episode also included segments about a woman who sells personalized poems at Los Angeles farmers’ market in lieu of food, and a community of          rock-climbers who push their limits on cliffs.
Students are responsible for researching, pitching and creating content for each segment. Birman said the one segment in particular that highlighted his students’ ability to create powerful content was the segment “Ghost Bikes.”
“Ghost Bikes” followed two men: one who creates memorials for cyclists fatally injured by vehicles and another who is a survivor of a cycling accident that left him an amputee.
Damien Kevitt, whose right leg was amputated after he was hit by a vehicle and dragged onto a freeway ramp, said he enjoyed working with members of the Impact staff. He said it was clear that the students were very dedicated to creating a powerful documentary.
“I’d been on other TV stations and working with students was much more light-hearted and creative,” Kevitt said. “They had that new adventure attitude and an interest in making sure something impactful was there.”
Sarah Politis, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism and producer of “Ghost Bikes,” said that she valued the experience of becoming immersed in telling someone else’s story and seeing the impact on the audience.
“It’s the details that really have an effect on people, like when we revealed his leg and the audience saw he was an amputee and heard the ‘oh my gods’ from the audience,” Politis said.
The episode also highlighted two segments: one about rats as pets and another about competitive diving, both of which will appear in the next and final episode of the year.

Earlier this week, the GRAMMY Museum named USC as its first official university partner, according to USC News. This new affiliation was created due to the museum’s long-established relationship with the USC Thornton School of Music.
“USC Thornton and the GRAMMY Museum have been working together for some time now, and it is great to formalize our partnership with the new affiliate program,” said Robert Cutietta, dean of  the Thornton School of Music, in a press release.
The new partnership will grant USC access to the GRAMMY Museum’s information for educational use, curriculum purposes, internship opportunities and more.
“USC’s designation as the first official GRAMMY Museum educational affiliate builds on a wonderful existing partnership,” Bob Santelli, executive director of the GRAMMY Museum, said in a press release. “As a proud USC alumnus, I couldn’t be more excited to continue to build a strong relationship with our neighbors in the USC community.”
The GRAMMY Museum contains tributes to many longstanding legacies in music. Located at LA Live, the museum has 30,000 square feet of exhibits.
Since opening in December 2008, the GRAMMY Museum has pushed for innovation with its acclaimed programs, interactive technology and unique exhibitions. The museum is looking for similarly minded institutions to collaborate with them as affiliates in order to further their mission and educational initiatives, according to the press release. More GRAMMY Museum university partners will be announced later this year.
An event will take place at noon on Thursday, April 24 at the Flora L. Thornton Carolwood Courtyard to honor the new affiliation.

Weekend one of Coachella has come and gone, and by the time this column goes to print, weekend two will well be on its way. If you’re reading this column now and are planning on going to Coachella, leave. Parking is a b–ch.
Aside from parking (it literally took as much time driving from Los Angeles to Indio as it did to get in and out of the parking lot on day one), something troubling has been on my mind. I’m deeply bothered by the misappropriation of Native American culture at music festivals, Coachella being the most timely example.
As a young, white middle-class woman, part of me feels that it’s not really my place to speak to this issue as I don’t relate to it personally. Still, I can understand it. Though I am a confirmed Catholic, I’m not particularly religious. But, once in high school I spotted a handful of non-Catholic girls sporting rosaries as necklaces — they were using a religious item meant for the purpose of prayer to make a fashion statement. It really pissed me off and, frankly, it felt very disrespectful. I would hate for someone else to feel the same way.
Back to the matter at hand, if I’m bothered by the misappropriation of headdresses at music festivals, I can only imagine how the people who are directly affected by it feel. For that reason, I felt I needed to further explore this subject.
This trend is nothing new to Coachella, or other music festivals for that matter. But, a few examples stand out from this year. Alessandra Ambrosio and Vanessa Hudgens posted photos of themselves on Instagram wearing Native American headdresses, both of which received backlash. Then, of course, there were multiple non-celebrities wearing headdresses, many of which were lit up in neon (neon?!), at the festival.
Personally, I don’t think these examples come from a place of malice. Rather, I think they come from a place of ignorance. Even so, is it ok? If someone does not intend harm but it happens as a result is it still bad? Yes, absolutely.
USC’s Professor Tok Thompson, who works in the Department of Anthropology, grew up in backwoods Alaska in a community that was about half Native American — at least when he was born, before the oil boom. A number of Thompson’s extended family are Native American as well. For Thompson, Native American culture has had a “tremendous influence” on him.
Quite familiar with the culture, Thompson could not agree more that the misuse of headdresses, even without malicious intent, still have negative consequences, especially because they have deep religious and cultural significance.
“I don’t think it’s ever in good taste to caricature another culture’s ritual and/or religious robes,” Thompson wrote in an email. “Secular apparel is perhaps one thing, but feather headdresses were and are religious and sacred clothing.”
Thompson adds that eagle feathers are sacred symbols for many, if not most, Native American groups. Sacred. Think about that word. Headdresses are sacred, they are deeply significant, and yet festivalgoers wear these pieces as a mere fashion statement, as an accessory to adorn their drug-fueled bodies. They are desecrating years of tradition and cultural importance.
Wearing a headdress might not seem like a big deal. How could one minor fashion statement hurt an entire culture? But in the greater context of Native American treatment and representation, even a small act can fuel the oppression and misrepresentation that Native Americans have experienced for years. Moreover, these “small acts” represent Native Americans in ways that they have not personally chosen to be portrayed. Festival attendees should not speak for an entire group of people.
“Also to be considered is the way in which Native peoples in America have been denied their own voice in media and public presentations, instead being portrayed by the conquerors, depicting them variously as noble savages, savage savages and other sorts of primitive, past-oriented people — especially in the all-American genre of the Western,” Thompson wrote. “This makes the portrayal of them by others particularly fraught with tension, with clear links to the massive historical violence against them, and the continuing ignorance of their real issues.”
Even worse, this issue extends far beyond music festivals. When asked where else Thompson sees this misuse of Native American traditions, he responded, “Just about everywhere. The list is (nearly) endless.”
But there is a solution, and it’s all in our mindset. We’re quick to call ourselves a tolerant society but misappropriating Native American pieces that have deep cultural significance is just one of many examples that prove we have so much more work to do. We need to increase our understanding. We need to read up and learn about the cultures we’re misappropriating. And if that’s not an option, just don’t wear headdresses. If this is all about looking cool on social media, I’m sure your Instagram followers really don’t give a sh-t, so why should you care? It’s just one photo.
“If people want to demonstrate a sympathy and interest in Native American traditions, I can recommend much better ways,” Thompson wrote. “Why not learn a bit of the language of the group in which you’re interested? Many Native American languages have videos on YouTube for the learner. That would demonstrate a true, sustained interest much more than putting on a funny hat.”
He added: “Or, if the point is indeed to put on a funny hat,  I would suggest that there are many more suitable choices than this one.”

For attendees of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival upcoming second weekend, a little preparation can go a long way in crafting the best possible personal lineup to see during the final weekend of the festival. Here are some of the artists that everyone should check out and avoid this weekend:
FRIDAY
Must See:
Bonobo
Bonobo earned the dual distinction as being one of the best live sets at Coachella and one of the most grateful performers who earnestly thanked the crowd again and again between songs. Even though the dedicated and enthusiastic crowd knew every Bonobo song by heart, the energy of the live performance made every drop and transition thrilling to everyone standing in front of the stage. The smiles and the joyful mood of the dancing crowd made Bonobo’s set a highlight of the desert festival, and made the use of the word “magical” a plausible description of a Coachella experience.
OutKast
Everyone by now has heard of the disappointment and issues that characterized the OutKast reunion Friday night. It is true that OutKast’s long-awaited reunion was marred by consistent technical issues that visibly frustrated Andre 3000 as he gradually lost enthusiasm throughout the performance and seemed to be brooding over the fact that the performance wasn’t going perfectly, and had to be cut short because of a delayed start time. Fans of OutKast had a difficult time reconciling the performance they were seeing with the group they loved, but the legacy of OutKast is too strong to pass up a viewing, even with the aggressive crowd. There is a strong chance that OutKast will return stronger having resolved their technical issues by Weekend Two, and any serious hip-hop head will make sure to make it out to the set. OutKast might have lost their enthusiasm during their first set in years, but they have lost none of their chops.
 
Can Skip:
Bastille
Pandering to mediocre melodic arrangements and predictable lyrics, Bastille is a band that has nothing innovative to offer the pop spectrum and yet manages to garner a huge following. Both fans and critics should avoid Bastille’s set at Coachella, however, as the massive crowd will overflow from the sides of the tent and make for a restless, sub-par experience for anyone who didn’t manage to get to the set extremely early. Save the experience for a solo show, as the sheer amount of people squeezed in together during the late afternoon will take away from the experience of the performance.
 
Instead of one, see the other:
Duke Dumont v. Nina Kraviz
Laying down subs-heavy, minimalist dance tracks, Nina Kraviz brought edge to the Yuma tent, garnering huge enthusiasm from the crowd as she mouthed along to the vocals during her set and beamed out at the audience. Her set had enough variation and range in instrumentation to make it as much of a musical exploration as it was a great dance experience, especially as the glittery shark and multiple disco balls hanging from the ceiling reflected light over the crowd. Show up to her set early as the dance floor will still have plenty of breathing room, and head out when the Duke Dumont fans crowd the tent. Dumont is known for his danceable grooves, but his live set rested heavily on mediocre arrangements in between his hits and had nothing experimental or innovative to offer the crowd.
SATURDAY
Must see:
Future Islands
Future Islands has released one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2014, and even for those who have never heard the band’s music, Future Islands’ performance was on a completely different caliber from many of the other sets throughout the weekend. Grinning out into the audience, vocalist Samuel T. Herring grinded the air in front of him with the intent of a madman and the entire Gobi tent joyfully bounced along as Herring screamed and growled the lyrics over the bouncing pop backing beats while crouching over his mic on the ground.
Nas
Nas managed to not only make up for OutKast’s lackluster performance but went above and beyond, garnering massive roars from the crowd as he performed track after track from his critically-acclaimed album Illmatic, whose 20th anniversary is approaching. Nas remained one of the most humble performers of the festival, thanking the audience for supporting him and expressing amazement at how far Illmatic had come. Bringing out Jay Z as the special guest on the track “Dead Presidents II” which was at the center of the Jay Z and Nas feud back in the day, it became clear that Nas was there to fully enjoy something he had worked at for years. Though the screens had been lowered because of the dust storm, Nas’ set remained one of the most well-executed ones of the entire weekend, and an incredibly fulfilling experience for any hip-hop fan.
Can skip:
Julian Casablancas
Julian Casablancas’ set shouldn’t be skipped because of a lackluster performance or low energy. Refusing to play a single Strokes track, Casablancas roared through feedback-heavy noise tunes, which, for those so inclined towards that kind of sound, was an excellent performance. Though the music itself was excellent, Casablancas’ derision for the crowd and late arrival made for an uncomfortable relationship between audience and performer, clearly felt among those walking out in the middle because of Casablancas’ banter. Those in the crowd solely to hear “Last Nite” should not bother coming out, as should people who are opposed to a near-hour of almost constant pure noise. For those who don’t care about constant condescension and attitude from a performer, Casablancas’ set remains a must-see among the endless stream of indie-pop groups taking over music festival lineups, Coachella being no exception.
 
Instead of one, see the other:
Solange v. Pixies
Solange and the Pixies are quite far away from each other as far as musical genres go. Most Coachella attendees will have no problem choosing between these sets because of their musical tastes, but for those who appreciate a wider range of music and are torn, the Pixies are the way to go. As Solange has become a fixture within the music festival circuit, her always-excellent performances that feature plenty of dancing, sassy banter and an excellent backing band can be foregone for one day to hear the Pixies roar through their music, hit or otherwise. The sharp, blistering guitars and pounding drums make for a one of the most high-energy performances of the festival, and as guitarist Joey Santiago played his guitar held aloft, it was clear that the Pixies had lost none of their energy as the years have passed.
SUNDAY
Must see:
Chance the Rapper
Chance the Rapper’s set at Coachella was one of the best of the entire weekend, with Chance proving himself to be one of the hardest workers in hip-hop today and completely invested in making his audience a part of his performance. Dancing wildly around the stage, jumping off and running alongside the audience and dancing to a Chicago juke tribute at the end of his set, Chance’s excitement at being at Coachella was made all the more poignant by his address to the crowd at the end of his set, thanking them for their continued support and expressing his disbelief at how far he’s come in the music industry within the last year. Chance then jumped off the stage and walked along the entire front row of the audience, shaking hands and telling everyone “I love you.” The audience, already excited by Chance’s performance, danced even harder to the music and sang along to every song that Chance performed. Bringing out Vic Mensa and Justin Bieber as special guests, Bieber’s appearance was the only element that flawed Chance’s performance, as the audience began to lightly boo Bieber’s appearance while simultaneously reaching for their phones to take a picture. Bieber should not be a deterrent to the set, as Chance’s love and adoration for the crowd made up for the poor choice for his second guest appearance. At the end, it was difficult to find a single audience member who hadn’t felt a special sort of connection to the celebration that characterized Chance’s set.
Arcade Fire
Arcade Fire is the very last performance that should be seen at Coachella and one of the most emotional. Decked out in full costumes, each song that Win Butler and his band performed set off crazed cheering and a huge dance party among the audience. Pulling Debbie Harry (of Blondie fame) onto the stage as the special guest, the pop sensibilities of both Harry and Arcade Fire complemented each other perfectly and made for one of the great collaborations of the evening. As the performance progressed, the emotion heightened as the band members gave all the energy they had, and Butler railed against the VIP designation of certain audience members, reassuring the rest of the gathered crowd that VIP “isn’t important” and “to not worry about it.” When the audio for the performance was finally cut, the members of Arcade Fire each grabbed a small instrument and proceeded to march around the edges of the stage, singing the refrain of “Here Comes the Night Time” while accompanied by members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. As the crowd of thousands of people joined in a capella on the beautiful melody, people began to cry and embrace, the emotion of the evening reaching its peak. The band finally went backstage, but the beauty of what had happened lingered in the air as people began to walk back to their cars to pack for the drive home. Arcade Fire’s set was the only possible way to end a three-day festival that had so many emotional highs and lows.
 
Can skip:
Calvin Harris
Calvin Harris falls into the large and ever-increasing  group of mediocre electronic artists who utilize the same musical arrangements and guest artists to make tracks that are virtually indistinguishable from each other. While star power and the curiosity about the surprise guest during Harris’ set is tempting, audience members would do themselves more justice in checking out another group that doesn’t get as much radio airplay as Harris and forego the experience of hearing the exact same tracks heard multiple times on the radio each day.
Instead of one, see the other:
Blood Orange v. Rudimental
Dev Hynes makes incredible music to dance to as Blood Orange, with a beautifully melancholic pop sensibility that’s jazzy and sultry to the touch. His live performance, however, did not match the caliber of his music during the weekend, as he remained reluctant to acknowledge the crowd and would instead allow the guest vocalists to introduce the tracks. Acknowledging at one point that he “isn’t good at banter,” Hynes’ shyness didn’t allow the audience to let loose as much as they should have, and the substandard audio mix that completely drowned out his fragile vocals didn’t do justice to the excellence of his music. While the outdoor stage consistently had the most audio issues throughout the weekend, it seriously detracted from Hynes’ performance. While the audio mix is better in the back of the crowd, skip Blood Orange and see Rudimental instead, whose jazzy, danceable electronic instrumentations and collection of different vocalists made for a huge dance party in Mojave tent. Hynes will have to eventually get over his shyness in order to generate the kind of response that Rudimental garnered with their passionate performance.

USC basketball fans would like to forget this past season, when the Trojans only won two conference games. But first-year head coach Andy Enfield and fans got even more bad news on Wednesday when junior forward Byron Wesley, the team’s leading scorer from last season, announced that he would transfer and use his final year of eligibility elsewhere.
The transfer is a big surprise and shock to many, though Enfield stirred the pot towards the end of the season when he suspended Wesley for two games against Stanford and Cal for violating an unspecified team rule.
There is no doubt that the team will miss the services of Wesley, who was a three-year starter and was voted the team’s Most Valuable Player after averaging 17.8 points and 6.4 rebounds for the Trojans.
Enfield will have to replace three starters from next year now, with seniors Omar Araby and Pe’Shon Howard graduating as well.
As an upperclassman and team captain, Wesley also served as the unsung leader for a young USC team, a team that will need someone to step up next year to fulfill that role on the court and in the locker room. It will have to come from a junior though, as USC will not have any seniors on the roster next year.
To be honest, I don’t blame Wesley for choosing to spend his senior season at another school, somewhere where he could have a better chance at winning or making a trip to the NCAA Tournament. And especially after the season that the Trojans had, finishing 11-21 overall record and 2-16 in Pac-12 conference play.
Wesley will graduate with his degree this summer before transferring and will be eligible to play immediately wherever he lands.
According to CBS Sports’ Jon Rothstein, Wesley may very well be the hottest transfer on the market.
While Wesley is definitely going to be missed, the program will have to pick up, regroup and move on with its current players and talented incoming recruiting class, which includes four-star Etiwanda guard Jordan McLaughlin, who is ranked the No. 45 overall recruit by 247 sports.
The 5-foot-11 McLaughlin, a dynamic player who can do it all on offense and defense, was looking forward to be reunited with former high school teammate in Wesley, who was the number one rated player in California before coming to USC, but unfortunately, that card is now off the table.
It’s a shame, though, because I think that McLaughlin and Wesley’s playing styles would have really complemented each other, and the duo would have been a force to be reckoned with on offense, especially since they already had previous chemistry playing with each other in high school.
Maybe Wesley’s transfer is a sign of new beginnings for Enfield’s program, further ridding itself of the disappointing Kevin O’Neill era. The only O’Neill-recruited players that remain on the roster are freshman guard Kahlil Dukes and sophomore guard Brendyn Taylor.
Wesley became the sixth O’Neill-recruited played to transfer from USC.
A few weeks ago, freshman forward Roschon Prince, another recruit of O’Neill’s, announced that he intended to transfer to nearby Cal State Long Beach. The former California Gatorade Player of the Year and Long Beach Poly superstar did not fit Enfield’s system after a disappointing debut season.
It’s been hard for Enfield as he is trying to install this new fast-paced game plan, but without the right personnel. This was apparent last season.
I’m not going to say that this past season for USC wasn’t disappointing, but Enfield’s young group of players were learning a new system.
With his first true recruiting class coming in this next year, Enfield should look to shape his system for the players, not the players for the system.
Regardless, it looks like it will still be a couple of years before Enfield and the program are really able to do any sort of damage in a very competitive Pac-12.
I still remember the hype at the beginning of the year surrounding the hiring of Enfield and the arrival of “Dunk City” to the Galen Center, though that was not the case for a USC team that never really got into a rhythm last year.
After talking to assistant coach Dieter Horton, who also served under O’Neill, prior to the start of the season, he stressed how college basketball programs take at least two or three years to really turn around and this appears to be the case moving forward with Enfield.
USC men’s basketball is a program that surely has the capacity to be great but just can’t seem to get over the hump.
Even with transfers Katin Reinhardt (UNLV) and Darion Clark (Charlotte) becoming eligible to play in the fall and the additions of McLaughlin and forward Malik Price-Martin, I still don’t see Enfield’s team making any splashes in the demanding Pac-12 until year three.
The scoring should pick up with a couple of explosive guards now in the mix, but I don’t think that it will make up for the team’s lack of experience, leadership and chemistry under Enfield’s system.

The stakes are high for USC’s men’s tennis team today, as the Trojans have a chance to clinch the 2014 regular-season Pac-12 conference title and reassert their dominance over crosstown rival UCLA.
Final battle · Senior captain Ray Sarmiento will be one of two seniors honored today before singles play begins against crosstown rival UCLA. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The showdown between the No. 3 Trojans (24-2, 6-0) and the No. 5 Bruins (19-2, 6-0) will also serve as USC’s last regular-season home match of the season.
USC has won 15 consecutive matches, with its last loss coming at the hands of UCLA in a 5-2 decision in February. A week prior to that, the Trojans topped the Bruins, 4-3, in the semifinals of the ITA National Team Indoor Tournament. UCLA is also riding high, having won nine straight matches. UCLA’s only other loss on the season was to Baylor, a team USC defeated.
Today, one team will emerge as top dog in the Pac-12 by finishing the conference undefeated and earning the top seed in the Pac-12 Tournament. USC head coach Peter Smith said he  is excited for the matchup, but downplayed the importance of earning the No. 1 seed.
“Playing UCLA is like playing your brother — your step-brother — and we want to kick their butt and they’ll want to do the same thing,” Smith said. “I don’t necessarily care that much about the Pac-12 title. It’s more that I want to beat UCLA.”
The crosstown rivalry is always fierce, and a lot of pride is on the line for the Trojans, who fell to the Bruins three out of four times last season. To come out on top this time, Smith said there’s no special strategy other than mental toughness.
“I think it’s just taking care of our internal turmoil,” Smith said. “The doubles point is always important as well as our leadership and we need to go out and just play like men.”
Junior Roberto Quiroz, ranked No. 53 in the nation by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, will have to play like a man if he wants to continue his 15-match win streak in singles. The Ecuadorian’s only loss in dual-match play this season came at the hands of UCLA’s Mackenzie McDonald, so Quiroz will surely aim to avenge it today.
Senior co-captains Ray Sarmiento and Michael Grant will also have something special to fight for, as they will be playing the last regular-season home matches of their USC careers today.
Smith says emotions always run high on Senior Day, and these two players are particularly special.
“Ray was a huge part of two NCAA championships and is gonna go down as a four-time All American and pound-for-pound just an amazing athlete,” Smith said. “Michael has been a great, calming force on and off the court for the team. They’re our two captains, they’re voted captains. They’ve been voted captains two years in a row so that’s how the team feels about them. They’re just massive parts of this program.”
Grant, ranked No. 120 in the nation, is riding a nine-match win streak after working his way into a starting role for the Trojans this season. He sports a perfect 4-0 record in Pac-12 play this season and an 11-1 mark in dual matches.
Sarmiento enters the match as the No. 9 player in the country after having peaked at No. 3 earlier this season. He and junior Yannick Hanfmann comprise the No. 2 doubles team in the nation.
The match will kick off today at 10:30 a.m. Singles will begin at noon, immediately following the Senior Day ceremonies. The singles portion of the match will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Networks.
Sarmiento has mixed emotions about playing in his last big rivalry match as a Trojan at Marks Stadium.
“It’s bittersweet,” Sarmiento said. “But I mean I’ll definitely miss my coaches, teammates and just being around the team. It’s the Trojan spirit and family that means a lot. Of course I want to end with a ‘W,’ but we’ll leave it all out on the court.”

USC’s men’s volleyball team, which claimed the eighth and final seed in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament, will return to the postseason this weekend after missing the playoffs last season.
Youth movement · Outside hitter Lucas Yoder was voted the MPSF conference Freshman of the Year and All-MPSF second team this week. The San Clemente, Calif. native leads the Trojans with 384 kills this season. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The challenge for the Trojans (16-10, 14-10) will be to upset BYU, the top-seeded team in the tournament to keep their hopes for a national championship alive.
After concluding their regular season with a loss at Pepperdine on April 5, the Trojans missed a chance to clinch a spot in the MPSF tournament. The Trojans fell by a score of 25-18, 21-25, 25-19, 14-25, 15-11 to the Waves (18-6). As a result, the Trojans had to wait for the rest of the MPSF season to play out over the next week to see if they would make the playoffs.
USC had won both matches against Hawai’i this season, so the Trojans had the advantage over the Rainbow Warriors, another potential No. 8 seed, if a tie in the standings necessitated a tiebreaker. But with one less loss than the Trojans and two games remaining going into the last week of the regular season, Hawai’i could have claimed the last spot with a sweep of Pepperdine during a double-header last weekend. Though Pepperdine prevented the Trojans from celebrating a playoff-clinching victory a week earlier, the Waves ensured the Trojans would make the MPSF tournament by beating Hawai’i (15-12, 13-11) in both matches.
As one of the eight teams from the 13-team MPSF to qualify for the MPSF tournament, USC still has a chance of making the NCAA tournament. Six teams across the country will be invited to compete for the national championship and USC head coach Bill Ferguson assumes that three of those teams will come from the MPSF.
With three conferences in NCAA Division I men’s volleyball, each conference gets one automatic qualifier for the national championship tournament, and the other two spots will be at-large bids. According to the most recent American Volleyball Coaches Association poll, all but one of the top 10 teams in the country are from the MPSF. Ferguson says the two at-large bids will most likely go to MPSF teams.
If the Trojans win the MPSF tournament, USC would claim the automatic qualifier spot for the NCAA tournament.
The Trojans will travel to Provo, Utah and play the Cougars tomorrow night in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament. Ferguson said the team is particularly excited about the travelling to BYU, where the Cougars are undefeated this year.
“The place will be packed and they have great fans so the environment will be phenomenal,” he said. “I think our guys thrive in that environment.”
USC lost both matches to BYU (18-8, 18-6) this year, taking the Cougars to five sets at home on Feb. 1. The Trojans lost that matchup by a score of 16-25, 25-22, 15-25, 25-20, 15-10, but fell in straight sets on Feb. 28 in the Smith Fieldhouse by a score of 25-22, 25-16, 25-21. Ferguson said that the three-set result from the last trip to BYU is somewhat misleading, given that the Trojans have made huge strides since then.
“Sets one and three, we were actually pretty competitive into the early 20s,” Ferguson said of the last meeting. “At that time we weren’t serving well and we were passing okay but nowhere near the level we’re at now. We’re in a different league from where we were.”
BYU is ranked No. 4 in the AVCA poll, with USC coming in at No. 8. BYU finished the season on a four-match losing streak, dropping both matches of the double-header against No. 10 Hawai’i on April 4 and 5, then falling to No. 5 UC Santa Barbara and No. 9 UCLA a week later.
A win Saturday would advance USC to the semifinals next Thursday, April 24, against the winner of the UCLA vs. UCSB match. The MPSF tournament championship will be held Saturday, April 26 and the NCAA tournament will begin Thursday, May 1. The location for the MPSF semifinal and final is to be determined.
No. 1 Loyola-Chicago (25-1) of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association will host the NCAA tournament. Loyola-Chicago’s only blemish on an otherwise undefeated season came on Jan. 4 when USC defeated the Ramblers in Chicago in four sets by a score of 25-27, 25-18, 20-25, 15-25.
Ferguson says that given the Trojans’ low seed, they are unlikely to get an at-large bid if they do anything short of winning the conference tournament. But he said the team isn’t worrying about the rest of the tournament and is just focusing on BYU.
“We’re thinking about going 1-0 this weekend,” Ferguson said.
Saturday’s match is set to start at 6 p.m.

On Monday, Brandeis University announced that it revoked its 2014 commencement ceremonies invitation to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a controversial Somali-born feminist and political essayist known for her criticism of female genital mutilation and her anti-Islamic sentiments, according to Time. This revocation came as a result of outspoken objection by Brandeis students and faculty who likened the invitation of Ali to speak to an endorsement of her views. Though many have since denounced Brandeis’ decision as one that suppressed freedom of speech, the overall premise that universities ought to host controversial figures in favor of free speech overlooks the serious precedent such a decision could make.
Design by Julien Nicolai
 
Brandeis said the university had not previously been fully aware of Ali’s vilification of Islam. Had Brandeis done its homework, administrators would have discovered the extent of Ali’s activism, including her inflammatory criticism of Islamic fundamentalism and her overall critique of religion in general.
Ali’s opinions on Islam, however, go beyond critiquing just Islamic fundamentalism. Rather, her writings have debased the faith as a whole, which she describes as a “destructive, nihilistic cult of death” that needs to be “defeated,” according to The New York Times.
“Once it’s defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful,” Ali said in a 2007 interview with Reason magazine. “There is no moderate Islam. There are Muslims who are passive, who don’t all follow the rules of Islam, but there’s really only one Islam, defined as submission to the will of God. There’s nothing moderate about it.”
The question, however, shouldn’t solely be limited to whether Brandeis’ decision to revoke Ali’s invitation was a good or a bad one, but rather why Brandeis chose Ali for its honorary degree in the first place.
“Just as Brandeis does not inquire into the political opinions and beliefs of faculty or staff before appointing them, or students before offering admission, so too the university does not select honorary degree recipients on the basis of their political beliefs or opinions,” Brandeis said in a statement.
Try as Brandeis might, it is near impossible to separate the political beliefs and opinions of an individual like Ali when those very same beliefs and opinions have made her known in the first place.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali is without question a revolutionary figure. Her story of survival — from enduring genital mutilation to escaping from forced marriage — and her subsequent activism in opposition to the poor treatment of women make her an incredibly powerful voice. But bestowing an honorary degree comes with an understanding that the recipient is being honored for his or her work and ideas.
Universities such as Brandeis are free to bestow honorary degrees on whomever they see worthy of recognition. But to cop its decision to revoke the invitation out of supposed ignorance and, perhaps worse, to defend the initial decision in the spirit of free speech fails to acknowledge a fundamental truth: The precedent these arguments will make in favor of free speech won’t be selective to Islam alone. We cannot choose whose speech gets to be defended and whose doesn’t. Today’s dispute over Ayaan Hirsi Ali could be tomorrow’s dispute over another contentious figure known for their unpopular, yet strong, views. Whether the university likes it or not, Brandeis’ decision implies a moral standard that will extend beyond this one instance. What precedent they’ll leave is up to them.

Brandeis University’s recent revocation of its honorary degree invitation to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born feminist and political essayist, has caused a firestorm of outrage. Though the university claims that its withdrawal of the invitation was due to Ali’s radically Islamophobic views, the truth shows otherwise. Brandeis should have stood by the invitation it extended to Ali, a very apt speaker and representative of the university’s motto: “Truth, even unto its innermost parts.”
Design by Julien Nicolai
An outspoken women’s rights activist and compelling public figure, Ali seemed a sensible choice for an honorary degree in the months leading up to her visit. After an incendiary letter from more than 85 faculty members and a Change.org petition that garnered more than 6,000 signatures, however, Brandeis revoked its offer on April 8, announcing that it could not ignore the extent to which Ali’s views conflict with the university’s core values, implying that they were previously unaware of Ali’s controversial views. That seems hard to believe, as a mere two-second Google search on Ali would have revealed her controversial background and past statements.
This entire affair is indicative of a cowardly internal collapse under pressure that betrays the core values of any university. By withdrawing the invitation so suddenly, Brandeis is not only breaking a promise, but also personally attacking Ali’s dignity.
“Yet the slur on my reputation is not the worst aspect of this episode,” Ali told Time. “More deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles.”
In the letter requesting the revocation of Ali’s invitation, the Brandeis faculty members cited Ali’s divisiveness. But her message isn’t about divisiveness at all. As Ali pointed out in the Algemeiner, “Neither Brandeis nor my critics knew or even inquired as to what I might say,” which only goes to support her claim that they just wanted her to be “silenced” and barred from sharing her views.
In fact, a transcript of the speech Ali planned to make reveals that she intended to discuss women’s rights — not her issues with Islam. Her critiques of Islam are not based solely on the religion itself, but the cultural traditions and mindsets that stem from the faith that have previously oppressed women like her. Ironically, as if foreshadowing the revocation, Ali included in her speech, “I’m used to being shouted down on campuses, so I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today.”
Though her critics have pointed to Ali’s past statements as evidence of Islamophobic hate speech — such as a 2007 interview with Reason magazine in which Ali said Islam “is a destructive nihilistic cult of death” — they fail to mention that she herself is a victim of practices that would be considered barbaric in this country. At age 5, Ali suffered from female genital mutilation. Later on, she was forced into an arranged marriage, from which she escaped after seeking asylum in the Netherlands. To label her as “Islamophobic” is merely a weak attempt to deflect the real issues at hand. Her focus is not on hate, but on change.
“We need to make our universities temples not of dogmatic orthodoxy, but of truly critical thinking, where all ideas are welcome and where civil debate is encouraged,” Ali wrote in the transcript of the speech she had prepared. “I do not expect all of you to agree with me, but I very much appreciate your willingness to listen.” That willingness is key, and until we bring it back, voices such as Ali’s that so urgently need to be heard will be sorely missed out on.

Two weeks into the 2014 MLB season, things are starting to normalize. This is such a pivotal time in the year, because it’s the time when people are either feeling overly confident in their hot starters or uneasy about the players who are crawling out of the gates. There are plenty of guys that are severely under- and over-performing, and the question becomes whether the smart decision is to sell high, buy high, sell low or buy low on these players.
Sell High

Because of his surprisingly strong season last year, namely a .331 average with 74 runs, 20 homers and 84 RBIs in only 489 at-bats, all the experts pegged Cuddyer as the guy most likely to regress this season.
So what has he done to prove those haters wrong? Only hit an even more astronomical .386 average with numbers that, if extrapolated over the rest of the season, would end at 120 runs, 36 homers and 120 RBIs.
Clearly this guy isn’t a fluke, right? Unfortunately for Cuddyer owners, the explanation for his career year, aside from his new move to the hitting haven Coors Field, is the .380 batting average on balls in play, a metric used to determine luck (a .280-300 BABIP is normal). What is his BABIP this year? A similar .341. That number has to come down to earth, and so will the rest of his stats.
Honorable Mentions: Carlos Gómez (MIL), Adam Laroche (WAS), Alexei Ramírez (CWS), Dee Gordon (LAD) and Michael Morse (SF).
Buy High
Brandon Belt, San Francisco Giants 1B
The Giants’ first baseman of the future was so close to being traded. It was just last year that he was in manager Bruce Bochy’s doghouse after struggling for the first half of the season. After a stronger, albeit still disappointing second half, many baseball experts saw this progress and perceived it to be a sign that a big breakout was coming.
Well, any fantasy owner who put his or her chips in the Belt basket is looking real good right now. Hitting a meager (for a first baseman) 17 home runs last year, he is already on pace for 60, clearly proving to everyone that he’s found the power stroke that he hadn’t located since his stint in the minor leagues. The improved power numbers, however, have come at the expense of Belt loosening up his plate discipline. The former Texas Longhorn holds a 17:2 strikeout-to-walk ratio so far.
I anticipate that his plate discipline will improve with more time to adjust and, with the newfound power swing, Belt will be this year’s version of Paul Goldschmidt.
Honorable Mentions: Jose Abreu (CWS), Freddie Freeman (ATL), Ángel Pagán (SF), Giancarlo Stanton (MIA) and Anthony Rendon (WAS)
Sell Low
Prince Fielder, Texas Rangers 1B
Sorry to all those who invested in Fielder high in their drafts. Though you wouldn’t find Fielder anywhere near my teams this season, that’s more of a reflection of my belief in positional scarcity than it is anything against Fielder.
I actually believed in him, but it’s clear, even through just two weeks in the season, that Fielder isn’t going to rebound after last season’s disappointment. He is what he is at this point, and a change in ballparks isn’t going to cure his diminishing skills.
Obviously there’s still a chance that Fielder’s current dry spell is just a slump and he’ll return to 2012 form, but at this point, it’s just not likely. It’s in your best interest to trade Fielder to someone who shares that opinion. Cut your losses and go with a safer option.
Honorable Mentions: Kyle Seager (SEA), Brandon Phillips (CIN), Allan Craig (STL), Robinson Canó (SEA) and Josh Donaldson (OAK).
Buy Low
Edwin Encarnación, Toronto Blue Jays 1B
It’s always surprising to see a top-five hitter in baseball begin his first 54 at-bats under the Mendoza line with a .174 average, but that’s where we find ourselves with the Blue Jays slugger.
I should say, that’s where we find ourselves again with the Blue Jays slugger, as he more or less started in a similar disappointing fashion last year. Being only a few years removed from being a huge in-season surprise, many owners might feel as though Encarnación has regressed to the afterthought he was before 2011. But there’s no way he just loses all his skill.
For those who can remember, the great David Ortiz had a horrible slump that carried all the way until June — when Big Papi broke out in a big way and finished with numbers in line with his career norms. Encarnación will similarly realign his numbers with the standard, and you should be the one to take advantage of that. Once he regains his plate discipline, he should be back to his 40 homer ways.
Honorable Mentions: Matt Holliday (STL), Pablo Sandoval (SF), Miguel Cabrera (DET), Bryce Harper (WAS) and Joe Mauer (MIN).
