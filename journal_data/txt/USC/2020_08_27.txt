One hundred and four students have tested positive for the coronavirus since Monday, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman confirmed Thursday in a media briefing. Over the past three days, USC Student Health has seen a “very dramatic” rise in cases, totaling to the highest single increase in cases yet at the University.
Of the nearly 1,600 coronavirus tests conducted this week, with 500 of the tests still pending, 73 students tested positive through Student Health’s testing for individuals who are symptomatic or exposed to the virus. Through external testing distributor Color’s asymptomatic surveillance testing, 31 students tested positive with a 2.7% positivity rate — “very high” for typical population testing, which should be around 0.3%, Van Orman said. 
These numbers add to the “alarming increase” in the number of cases that Van Orman announced Monday in an email to the USC community. This week, the first three cases were identified in on-campus housing, Co-Medical Director and Faculty Physician of Internal Medicine Dr. Kimberly Tilley confirmed Wednesday. Additionally, eight student-athletes between USC’s football and men’s water polo teams have tested positive, USC Athletics announced in a press release Wednesday. 
According to Van Orman, all cases — including those identified in USC Housing — are related to off-campus activities.
“We do our case investigation and our contact tracing with every case, but with those particular cases in [USC] Housing, we of course did all of that evaluation,” Van Orman said in the briefing. “They were very much linked to off-campus activities, and did not really, there was no risk or exposure to the rest of the on-campus housing community.”
According to Van Orman, as of yesterday, about 60 individuals have been self-isolating at USC Hotel, which has enough capacity for 240 individuals to isolate single-occupancy. Based on cases from the past six months, Van Orman said that students have generally ranged from being asymptomatic to having mild cold-like symptoms to contracting high fever and more significant illness, the last of which is the minority. Only one student was hospitalized briefly in June, though Van Orman said they were not an undergraduate and older than the typical college student demographic. 
“The more people that get [the coronavirus], the more the likelihood is that we will have unfortunately someone with a severe outcome, and of course that’s what we really want to try to avoid at all costs,” Van Orman said. “I do think that there is a perception that this is a mild illness and this is not an illness that’s going to cause any harm to someone who’s maybe younger or healthier, and while the likelihood is much lower than in an older population, that doesn’t mean that it can’t happen.”
Van Orman said she has been meeting with several student groups, fraternity presidents, off-campus landlords and more to communicate that USC Student Health is available for testing. However, she stressed that students not only need to get tested regularly, but they also need to adhere to social distancing guidelines.
“There’s really no rate of testing and contact tracing that allows people to gather in congregate settings when you have high community rates,” Van Orman said. “So certainly testing and contact tracing are really important, but it has to be paired with social distancing to try to control high rates of transmission.”

With his trumpet case swaying back and forth beside him as he walked past the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, Aaron Ghrist, a senior majoring in chemistry and applied and computational mathematics, would normally be heading to Schoenfeld Symphonic Hall for the Concerto Chamber Orchestra’s weekly practices after class. However, practices came to a halt in mid-March for the group and many other performance groups as California and Los Angeles County placed restrictions on in-person gatherings during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Instead of postponing practices for a future date, the orchestra group gathered on Zoom to practice and put together its first virtual concert over the summer. In an effort to share its members’ musical talents with the USC community, CCO held a 14-day digital festival from July 18 to Aug. 1, featuring movements from Saint-Saëns’ “The Carnival of the Animals” each day, including “Tortues” and “Personnages à longues oreilles.”  
The student-run organization is composed of mostly non-music majors at USC and welcomes all undergraduates interested in concert performance. 
Adam Karelin, who directs music for the organization, said the idea for the digital festival followed his realization in the spring semester that the group of more than 80 musicians would be unable to handle remote collaborations due to the difficulty for them all to participate on Zoom simultaneously. The music festival that involved around 30 recruited musicians worked as a trial run for future activities on a virtual platform. 
“[We] saw it as a great opportunity for people to connect — not just musicians to connect with one another on a larger project, but also our orchestra with the USC community,” Ghrist said. 
The theme of the digital festival, Carnival of the Animals, looked to whimsicality and playfulness in its musical interpretation of the personas of different animals. According to Ghrist, the playful piece was initially not taken seriously when it was first performed in 1886, as Saint-Saëns originally wrote it to bring humor to a private audience. However, CCO musicians thought the piece was “a great way to bring some levity amongst the current social dynamics.”
As a performance group, the in-person component is integral to traditional orchestra practice, but the students were able to modify the format of their activities to focus on sharing music with the community in addition to practicing as a group. Starting preparations about a month and a half earlier, students were able to collaborate on Zoom by using shared screens, checking the mix of music along with everyone on the team and discussing the musicians’ ideas and goals for the festival.
Vice President of CCO Linda Diaz said the virtual concert kept expanding with ideas as the group met and put together the project. 
 “Our favorite quote was, ‘Oh, this shouldn’t take too long,’” Diaz said. “I feel like I felt myself saying that a lot, but then it would take longer. And usually, this was because we’d have one idea, and then more would bloom from that, and that blooming became the final product.” 
For Karelin, one of the greatest benefits of putting together a digital performance was the ability for musicians to send in their best performance since issues that would normally be unpreventable in a live performance could be avoided by submitting a better take. 
“In-person music making is exciting in its own way, but the interesting thing about remote recording projects is that it’s more akin to a studio recording,” Karelin said. “If on the day of the concert, [a performer was] having an upset stomach, and they played a little out of tune, then we can’t factor those things in when preparing for live performances.”
Instead of simply sitting in a traditional chamber orchestra formation, CCO musicians looked to provide a fresh visual component to enhance the listening experience. Collaborating with the USC Chamber Ballet Company and ballet dancers from Kaufmann, about half of the musical movements were accompanied by footage of dancers performing original ballet choreography. For the seventh movement, “Aquarium” the group collaborated with Aquarium of the Pacific, a public aquarium in Long Beach, by adding special footage of the aquatic life to contribute to the playful musical component. 
“Virtual performances have been done by so many orchestras already — with all the musicians in rectangles on the screen — which is great to see everyone, but we saw this as an opportunity to share our music in a more engaging way,” Diaz said. “Even with this situation having everyone separate, we were able to incorporate choreography from members … through this platform when we wouldn’t have been able to fit them in Schoenfeld Hall.” 
The festival culminated with a watch party livestream shared on Facebook and received great support from faculty and students. In a congratulatory email to the group, USC Thornton School of Music professor Veronika Krausas was greatly supportive of CCO’s choice to perform the Carnival of the Animals because of its nostalgic value to her as a musician. 
“[Carnival of the Animals is] one of those pieces that’s so dear to me and completely reminds me of my childhood,” Krausas wrote in the email. “My dad has the record … and the combination of music and the narration has probably influenced me more as a composer than I realize! I’ve been [Zooming] with my family and we’ve been watching every day or two the different [CCO] videos and yesterday we watched the whole thing.”
The group is looking to include more digital content across their platforms, even after county and state restrictions on in-person events have been lifted. While about 100 to 200 people could normally fill Schoenfield Hall, Karelin said some of the digital performances have reached over 5,000 people.  
Ghrist said the performance group is planning a number of chamber ensembles that will be released throughout the year in the form of shorter videos. A concert featuring collaborations with the Thornton School of Music’s jazz department is also being planned for the start of November. In the fall, CCO also looks to incorporate the current climate of ongoing worldwide protests and action against anti-Blackness to spread awareness about racial inequality in the field of classical music. 
“There is so much white supremacy pervasive in classical music, from the repertoire that we’re taught from a very young age to the admissions and auditions process,” Karelin said. “The programming that we’re pursuing this season, virtually all of it centers around restorative justice in one form or another. Just because we weren’t taught the music of these Black composers doesn’t mean we should continue ignoring it in our practice.”
Heading into the fall semester, the group is inviting USC students, alumni, staff and faculty who are interested in music to consider playing with the Concerto Chamber Orchestra and contribute to future performances.

As more than 180 freshmen joined the Zoom meeting remotely from various locations, they were welcomed to USC with instant festivity as energizing songs such as “Future” by Musiq Soulchild played through their laptop speakers and a colorful PowerPoint lit up their screens. These students would make USC history as the first incoming class to attend Black Convocation. 
An event dedicated to welcoming the incoming class of Black Trojans, founded in collaboration between the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, the Black Alumni Association, the Black Graduate Student Network and the Black Student Assembly, the ceremony was held Sunday as a means of promoting community despite the fully online semester.
In previous years, CBCSA has welcomed Black students by hosting a Labor Day barbecue. However, following the ban of on-campus events, CBCSA director Greedley Harris felt compelled to find a new way to build a sense of home for Black freshmen.
“We wanted to do something to welcome our Black students, because we weren’t doing an in-person event,” Harris said. “I think our Black students have been dealing a lot with anti-Blackness, with microaggressions, with overt and covert racism. This event was needed from a community perspective to show support and to show our incoming students who won’t have a physical place that they could go right now that there’s still community and that there’s still support.”
Kicking the event off, assistant director of the Black Alumni Association Tensie Taylor filled each student’s room with her voice as she sang the Black National Anthem.  
The event featured introductions from Vice President for Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Black faculty members from various schools who welcomed the students to the University. LaVonna Lewis, associate dean of diversity, equity and inclusion at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, explained the degree programs and career services the department offers.
“We recognize that we are in interesting times, conflictual times, tense times,” Lewis said. “And again, you’re entering the University. They’re struggling with those issues again, trying to make us a more just University as part of our just society. We don’t know how everything works but we do know that these are the time for good ideas, these are the times for exploring differences of opinion.”
Morgan Darby, a freshman majoring in international relations, global business who attended the event, said it helped her feel welcomed to USC despite beginning her college experience remotely. 
“I got excited about being in the community even though I’m sitting in my room at home far away from USC,” Darby said. “I can probably go to anybody, any staff or any student, for help. I have a good feeling that people will be willing to help me no matter the issue.”
In a virtual tour of campus, Spencer Boras, a senior majoring in music industry, told attendees about annual events BSA typically hosts, including GearFest, a concert highlighting Black artists held at McCarthy Quad, and Mahogany Ball, a banquet for Black students. 
Several student speakers also offered insight based on their experiences at USC. Co-director of BSA Jaya Hinton emphasized the strength of the Black Trojan Family and the various ways incoming Black students could find community. She cited BSA’s USCiblings program, which brings new students, both freshmen and transfers together with other Black students that have attended for at least two semesters who can help them navigate college and share advice, as one example.
“We will match you to [an upperclassman] based on your interest, or your major, or your career goal,” said Hinton, a junior majoring in business administration. “We’ll have specific competitions, meetings, interactions for you to get to know them, to have them help you navigate this new experience and just start building that support system that you absolutely need.”
Hinton also shared other organizations on campus for students to be involved in to “get connected [and] to stay connected.” Between Sisters in Solidarity, a group for Black women and nonbinary students to discuss issues impacting the community, and professional organizations under BSA like Minorities and Medicine, Hinton underscored the importance of finding a sense of belonging on campus.
“I implore you to come to BSA and to get involved in those member [organizations], to find those niche groups where you feel welcome … [by] expanding your family, expanding your network,” Hinton said. 
Following Hinton’s speech, President of the Black Graduate Student Network Lawrence Rolle encouraged Black incoming freshmen to network with one another and take advantage of the resources that groups offer, such as the Black Alumni Association, which seeks to connect current and former Black students. 
“Be strong in your Black community, in your Blackness and be grounded in it, and also reach out and learn from the other coaches that we have here,” Rolle said.
As a Black Alumni Association scholarship recipient, Rolle said that Black students should do their best to be involved with the Association as soon as possible, crediting it as a source of support during his time as a college student. 
Athletic Director Mike Bohn also spoke at the event, commenting on recent instances of racial injustice and expressing his commitment to supporting the Black community at USC. 
“We must confront dead on, together and with urgency and purpose the social injustices that are tearing our communities apart,” Bohn said. “We are all excited to continue to work with Black students and staff on sustainable and transformational initiatives to effect change at a critical time in our history.”
These remarks were followed with a musical performance by Yafeu Tyhimba, a second-year master’s student in the Thornton School of Music. He, along with other USC alumni, performed a medley of songs that incorporate various genres, such as R&B, jazz and hip-hop.
“This medley will tell the stories of desire, grief, and determination; stories that exist today in the African American experience,” read the event program.
Throughout the convocation, many speakers, such as the director of counseling and mental health at USC Student Health Dr. Broderick Leaks, offered information about access to University resources, including Disability Services and Programs and Student Health’s counseling services.
Leaks encouraged students to seek counseling and said the department makes an effort to place patients with caregivers with whom they identify.
“All of our therapists have a value and a passion for cultural competency and diversity awareness,” Leaks said. “We do know that some students have a preference to work with someone who looks like them. Just reach out if you would like any type of mental health support and that you can also make a special request to work with a therapist of color, or any identity that you’re seeking support with.”
Despite the inability to gather physically, for Darby, the event was still a positive experience. 
“It was really lively,” Darby said. “I came into it thinking it was just going to be one of the general welcome events that had been going on, [but] I was pleasantly surprised.”
CBCSA center supervisor Damarea Parker said that he felt attendees were able to get what they wanted and needed out of the event with regard to both school resources and displayed community support. He said the event was a way to reaffirm to students that they belong on campus. 
“It’s an event to say and to let them know that we see you … you’re here … you have value,” Parker said. “And also, you made it to USC. It means a whole lot. We’re going to make sure that you’re surrounded by a community that’s going to pour into you to make sure that you get to the goal and achieve things that you want.”
Both Parker and Harris said that they are looking forward to continuing the event as a tradition. 
“We’re already thinking about next year, what we want to do, how we want to do it and just how big it can get,” Parker said. “We’re looking at it as a legacy event and really [asking] ‘How big can we make Black Convocation?’”

When I decided to join the Daily Trojan team, I thought that I would be able to use my status as a student-athlete at USC to write about how my peers in athletics have navigated the recent surge in the fight against racial injustice. 
For my debut in this sports column, however, I felt the need to talk about a recent tragedy that hit too close to home. 
I am originally from Milwaukee, Wis. I grew up going to Bucks, Brewers and Packers games. The Bucks currently are on the road to advancing in the NBA Playoffs with reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, bringing loads of excitement to the city. 
At this current moment in time, I wish the Bucks were the biggest story coming out of Wisconsin. Instead, just two days ago, Jacob Blake, a Black man in Kenosha, was shot seven times in the back by police — a 45-minute drive from where I grew up. 
As the NBA wraps up the first round of playoffs, players would normally be dialed into finishing their respective series and looking forward to the next matchup. In light of current events, many star players, including LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers, shifted their attention to what happened in Wisconsin. 
“Quite frankly it’s just fucked up in our community,” James said in a press conference after Monday’s Game 4 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. “And I said it, I know people get tired of hearing me say it, but we are scared as Black people in America. Black men, Black women, Black kids — we are terrified.”
With a strong 3-1 series lead over Portland, James would normally be concerned with his next opponent, the winner of the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder matchup, who are both playing at the top of their games at the moment. 
Instead of seeing his next opponent in the playoffs as the biggest threat to be concerned about, a veteran star of the league sees police in the United States as the biggest threat. Even a man standing at 6-foot-9, 250 pounds and earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year still shares a common fear of police that many in the Black community face today. 
Going into the NBA bubble, racial injustice was already at the center of attention for the league as players put statements on the back of their jerseys, knelt for the national anthem in unity and most overtly, played on a court with “Black Lives Matter” written in large, bolded letters. 
In the wake of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless other Black Americans, backlash arose from several players in the league to whether they should be playing when the Black Lives Matter movement had an international spotlight. Now after another incident of police brutality, players have circled back to the same concern from early July. 
“We shouldn’t have even [come] to this damn place, to be honest,” George Hill, a guard for the Milwaukee Bucks, said in a press conference Monday. “Coming here just took all the focal points off what the issues are. But we’re here. It is what it is. We can’t do anything from right here. But I think definitely when it all settles, some things need to be done.”
This widespread concern is all separate from the fact that the world is in the midst of a pandemic that has postponed collegiate sports across several major conferences, including the Pac-12. I cannot speak for every athlete; however, this absence of sports and national focus on injustices has altered my perception of where my priorities land at this moment in time.
Speaking from my experience as a collegiate volleyball player, schoolwork always comes first with volleyball following close behind in terms of personal priorities. With the time, mental toughness and physical endurance needed to invest in these activities, this leaves little room for awareness of the larger world around me.
With the absence of competition for the past five months, this void has been filled with an oversaturation of news regarding the election, the current global pandemic and protests for racial equality. 
This leaves me wondering: Once I begin competing again for volleyball, will my priority have to be playing volleyball? Does this mean I have to sacrifice being an active participant in the fight for social justice? Is there a balance between the two despite the mental energy that each drains? All these questions apply, but with even more urgency, for Black athletes as they have to actively consider their priorities in tandem with their own community of family and friends. 
Americans have always found solace in sports, as it offers a distraction from the worries of life at home. For the average fan, watching a game may help them forget the pressures of their work and everyday life. For the player, the game is their work. After the final buzzer, muscles and bones are going to need recovery. Film will need to be studied and preparations begin for the next game. 
Once the clock has expired and all the preparation has been done for the next game, how will their minds and bodies recover when they return to a world that is still in pain?
About 12 hours after finishing the first draft of this column, I received a notification that the Bucks had not taken the court in their Game 5 matchup to protest the shooting of Blake.
I was moved with immense pride by the leadership that my hometown team showed. My pride immediately grew even more as the Brewers followed suit, and eventually within the hour, the NBA had postponed every game that day to show solidarity with the players’ sentiments — all starting with the Bucks’ initial leadership.
After reading the Bucks’ statement on the situation following initial reactions, I hear echoes of the same principles that resonate in my own USC volleyball program.
“When we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable,” the Bucks’ statement read. “We hold ourselves to that standard, and in this moment, we are demanding the same from our lawmakers and law enforcement.”
Across all levels of competition, from high school to professional, a central principle of teamwork is accountability. A team cannot function to its highest potential without its members holding themselves and each other accountable. In this moment, our government will not perform its highest duty of representing its people unless we hold it and ourselves accountable. 
So until this happens, focus will be on national reform, not a playoff series.

There is a prevalent, long-standing idea that young people — specifically, ages 18 to 29 — chose not to vote. Statistics comparing the 2020 Democratic primaries and 2018 Midterm elections to previous elections provided by the United State census seem to support this notion: In 2014, the 18-29 year old vote made up 20% of total voters and in the 2020 primary elections, young-adult voters made up less than 20% of the vote. 
However, it only takes a few minutes scrolling through Twitter or Instagram to recognize that young adults are heavily involved in politics. In 2016, about 90% of young voters showed an interest in politics, with 80% intending to vote; thus, disproving that this age group of 18-29 is disengaged from the political scene. This, then, begs the question of where the disconnect between political involvement and political action among 18-29 year olds lies and why college students and young adults are not making it to the polls. 
“Kids are lazy” and “kids are too young to understand politics” are comments often spewed from all ends of the political spectrum and aimed as attacks on young adults. After the last Super Tuesday, many Democrats went so far as to blame young adults for the low voter turnout and Sen. Bernie Sanders’s loss. That being said, addressing the issue of low young-adult voter turnout is not that simple when all factors are considered. 
First, these tired stereotypes of “laziness” and “naiveté” both fall under the umbrella of ageism. Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research, explained how claiming something is inherently wrong with young adults is equivalent to saying something is inferior about young adults, thus expressing an ageist idea.
Neither laziness nor hypocrisy are exclusive to 18-29 year olds, and there is thus no logical basis to hastily attribute these traits to all young people. Propagating this not only discourages them from taking part in this system, it also deflects from a much greater cause of young-adult voter suppression. 
Voter suppression is something many social groups face, young people among them. The reasoning behind why the 18-29 year old vote would even be worth suppressing has much to do with the simple fact that most colleges and universities —as well as their student bodies — skew left. At a time when the popular vote seems to favor Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump has turned to questioning the credibility of mail-in ballots from “blue” states and is accused of suppressing votes by flip-flopping on defunding the United States Postal Service, it does not seem absurd to think liberal college students would be deprived of the fulfillment of their civic duty. 
In Texas, University of Texas at Austin students only had two nearby polling stations this past primary election, culminating in long lines and many potential voters being forced to leave before casting their ballot due to work and class. In fact, polling stations in close proximity to colleges are rare. In a Daily Trojan op-ed written during the primary elections in January, students saw how close to home this lack of accessibility truly is as USC lagged behind UCLA in making voting more accessible to students. 
Along with not having easy access to voting stations, something unique to college students are strict voter requirements by location. College students tend not to have a permanent home over the course of their college education. This can manifest as having a home in one state but moving out-of-state for college or living in dorms then moving to an apartment. States require identification of a permanent resident address, which a lot of college students do not have as seen in FindLaw’s research of young-adult voter suppression. 
In some cases, college students also have to have a state ID to register to vote, which can take months to arrive. Most states also have confusing registration deadlines — same-day registration is becoming less and less common despite the link between allowing for same-day registration and increased voter participation and some states do not offer online registration. Only 18 states and the District of Columbia offer pre-registration for 16-year-olds, and civics is often no longer a requirement in high schools.. 
This accumulation of requirements, prerequisites and lack of resources all amount to an inherent problem in today’s voting system. Especially in the era of the coronavirus, where online registration and mail-in ballots could make all the difference in young adult voter turnout, this is troubling.
So, no, college students and young adults are neither lazy nor uneducated. Rather, the voting system is systematically pitted against them. The question lies in how to address this problem. The most challenging thing about young-adult voter suppression is actually getting young adults to talk about it. It seems simple to accept stereotypes as truth rather than question them. 
The second shortcoming lies in the difference between knowing about a problem and acting on it. Young adults have been at the forefront of demands for social justice and policy action, which must spill over to fighting for registration accessibility and the right to vote. 
This goes farther than calling followers to “register to vote” on an Instagram story — there has to be an active stream of young people sending voter registration resources to each other as well as calls to action from young adults to politicians to make registering and requesting mail-in ballots easier. Voting in a democratic society should never be this difficult or this insidious.

Sustainable. Eco-friendly. Recycled. Ethical. Environmentalism is trending, and there are more “green” products and options available than ever before. It’s easy to use a metal straw for your iced coffee and pat yourself on the back for your choice, but it is far more difficult to stop and ask yourself: What do these words really mean, and what is their impact? Does the “sustainable packaging” label mean that no carbon dioxide emissions were released in the processing of this product? What does it mean when a vegan diet is described as “cruelty-free” — and is it really? I’ll be the first to admit that it’s an exhausting, confusing and often disappointing rabbit hole to go down.
More often than not, these enticing, aesthetic labels are feel-good buzzwords designed to make you pick up a product and buy it, but not necessarily a concrete guarantee of anything. A combination of media influence, hearsay and strategic marketing can entice the casual nature-lover to invest in many things that aren’t any better for the Earth than their alternatives. Most shampoos are still shampoos — a primarily plastic bottle filled with a mixture of chemicals and toxic sulfates — no matter what kind of earthy, inventive packaging they are disguised in. 
As an environmental studies student and avid nature lover, I’ve done my fair share of digging into the world of false environmental advertising. There’s no getting around it; nearly everything we use is in some way harmful to the planet. This week, for instance, I learned that my “nontoxic” surf wax is petroleum-based and non-biodegradable.
We toss our plastic containers into the recycling bin, but any sort of waste accidentally thrown in with it will contaminate the entire batch; often it’s all just thrown away, anyways. The list goes on and on, and it’s admittedly and extremely depressing. However, it’s essential to understand how the world works and that even recycled, re-used, repurposed items can still have just as many negative environmental implications.
As the human population continues to grow, more products and services are manufactured to keep up with rising demand while little thought goes into how they alter our environments. I’m in no position to preach — it’s difficult to go grocery shopping and pass up Trader Joe’s plastic-packaged mango slices. However, it’s important to adapt a learning attitude and while I try to alter my behavior and make eco-friendly choices when I can, sometimes it’s just too expensive and inconvenient to do so when the alternative is so readily available.
Many social enterprises, nonprofits and government agencies focus on the concept of a triple bottom line: people, planet and profits. This loose set of guidelines is meant to measure an organization’s activity and impact on the world, prioritizing customers and stakeholders, their environmental impact and running a successful business with all things equal. While the idea is simple enough, defining a metric by which to measure these impacts is much more complex.
Every organization, corporation and human has its own definition of what positive change consists of. The same holds true for the concept of sustainability itself. Sustainability has become a sort of overarching umbrella term used to refer to anything created or designed with a positive (or minimal) environmental impact in mind. 
All this is not to say that environmentalism is a sham — it’s just extremely difficult to strike a balance between what’s best for the earth and our resources and what’s best for society. Historical trends suggest that many societal decisions are based partially on the concept of utilitarianism — weighing the pros and cons and choosing an option that is best for the greatest number of people. In many instances, this concept goes directly against everything environmentalism stands for. 
For example, at this moment in time, it would be practically impossible to power the entire United States using a renewable power source. To convert to primarily solar power, the U.S. would have to completely alter the way we use and store electricity, affecting the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people. From partitioning open spaces to integrate enormous photovoltaic grids to making solar electricity as easily installable and affordable as traditional fuel sources, the conversion process offers the potential for many new jobs, but improvements are still needed to reach a level of reliable efficiency.
I’m throwing all kinds of depressing information at you, and for what purpose? How can we fix these seemingly unfixable things? Serious improvement may seem far-fetched, but the possibility does exist. 
Part of the problem is that not all environmental issues are purely environmental — the triple bottom line is a tightly interwoven web, with each constituent element drastically influencing the others. There’s no denying that the amount of work we need to do to mitigate our rapidly changing landscapes and climate is staggering, and in some cases, utterly impossible. However, scientists and activists are not the only ones who play a role. 
You don’t have to be a fully-fledged eco-warrior or live off the grid to be a conscientious consumer (full disclosure — I am neither). Take accountability for your actions, consider where goods came from and where they’re going and read words like ‘sustainable’ with a critical eye.
Achieving progress in any area can be slow-going. Finding effective, feasible and long-term solutions to environmental issues in our society requires careful consideration from many different angles and the compromise of a variety of factors. 
It is important to remember that big changes often result from a litany of smaller changes. No, a single metal straw isn’t going to save the world (I have many more thoughts on metal straws, but I’ll save that for another day), but it’s a single step toward building good habits, resourcefulness and awareness that will snowball into a larger environmental impact.
