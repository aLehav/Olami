In anticipation of USC’s homecoming football game this Saturday, a homecoming carnival and parade was held Thursday night in McCarthy Quad. Hosted by the Office of Campus Activities, the homecoming throwback theme “#TBTUSC” was a prominent feature of the carnival.
The night of “#TBTUSC” throwback festivities included free food along with games and activities.
One of the event’s main attractions, organized by Trojan Pride, USG Program Board and the USC Graduate Student Government, was a 40-by-60 foot roller skating rink equipped with a disco ball and throwback tunes. The event also included a popular enlarged foosball table.
Shawn Rhoads, special projects coordinator for Campus Activities, explained that he and his team has been planning homecoming since the beginning of the semester.
“Back in September, we organized a committee with all the other student organizations,” Rhoads said. “We wanted to revamp spirit programs by encouraging collaboration among more USC groups.”

The Office of Campus Activities offers involvement opportunities for students by promoting different organizations and leadership programs. It is also responsible for putting together annual USC traditions and events such as Conquest and Friends and Neighbors Day.
Rhoads mentioned that this year was the first time the committee incorporated a theme for homecoming.
“We wanted to jump back in time and celebrate all things retro,” Rhoads said. “That’s why we went with #TBTUSC and had each student organization organize their own throwback activity.”

Among other activities, a photo booth, hosted by Program Board, served as a popular attraction of the evening. The Women’s Student Assembly hosted face painting, the Environmental Student Assembly hosted a vegan pie-eating contest and the Latina/o Student Assembly contributed to the theme of the evening with a selection of “throwback candy” such as Gushers, Nerds, Pixy Stix and Fun Dip.
Other elements of nostalgia included an arcade area and a tie-dye shirt-making booth that was hosted by the Performing Arts Committee.
The Trojan Marching Band also performed an outdoor concert to pump up school spirit in preparation for homecoming weekend.
Neil Dang, a sophomore majoring in biology, said the skating rink was what attracted him to the event.
“The carnival sounded like a fun thing to do,” Dang said. “I heard about the events, and I was excited and looking forward to roller skating.”

Few but those pursuing a health-related major know about the Emergency Medical Services of USC, a student organization comprised of emergency medical technicians that provides emergency pre-hospital care on and around campus.
Since its founding in 2009, EMSC has been providing medical assistance at large events at USC, such as the Obama Rally, the Festival of Books, the Welcome Back Concert, graduation and football tailgates. EMSC is now looking to expand the range of events that they cover.
Sean Neifert, the EMSC director, is working alongside Austin Churchill, the assistant director to the USG Wellness Affairs committee, to push a resolution that would increase EMSC’s reach.
“We are looking at things like philanthropies and parties on the Row and other events on campus,” Neifert said. “We have a plan so that student organizations can contract with us directly instead of going to the administration, and then we can submit the forms to our adviser so that she can approve the events.”
A similar proposal was made in March, but now Neifert is working on having all the details figured out.
“It’s really the liability aspect,” Neifert said. “The administration has this view of us as student EMTs, when we’re really emergency medical technicians who also happen to be students. They think that our certification doesn’t mean as much, and they think we’re going to mess up when we’re on the field. I can tell you with confidence we’re not going to.”
Neifert added that EMSC is not a replacement to the fire department but a valuable assistance in the moments before an ambulance arrives. He stated that the Department of Public Safety Emergency, which has no medical training other than CPR, will simply call the fire department and not provide emergency assistance in the meantime. Because most emergencies deal with intoxicated students, Neifert argues that the waiting gap can be crucial.
DPS Deputy Chief David Carlisle said that all DPS officers receive first-aid and CPR training. In addition, some DPS officers have received EMT certification independently. Carlisle said that paramedics typically respond so quickly that it makes sense for DPS officers to wait until they arrive on the scene. He also said that DPS is starting combat medical training for officers so that they can provide more advanced care such as applying field dressings and tourniquets.
Neifert, however, believes the response time is still too long.
“The average response time for the fire department is six minutes, and in those six minutes a lot of stuff can happen,” Neifert said. “Six minutes of no oxygen to your brain, and you’re pretty much brain-dead.”
Neifert, who also holds a job at a hospital in Orange County, explained how other universities have larger student EMT programs. He gave Johns Hopkins, Brown and UCLA as examples. The latter, for instance, has a 24/7-ambulance service completely staffed by students.
“I think [UCLA] is a great model to go off of,” Neifert said. “I think, obviously, USC is definitely a different situation. It is a private school, we don’t have a hospital on campus as well, so those are definitely things we need to consider. But when you look at UCLA they really put trust in their students.”
Neifert also mentioned that all members of EMSC take skills tests at the end of each semester and have training sessions twice a week. Such high amounts of training, Neifert argued, show the commitment and dedication of student EMTs. Because of this, the University has no reason not to bestow EMSC greater responsibilities.
“Our administration is behind the times on how they view student safety and wellness in regards to this issue,” Neifert said. “The administration has to step up to the plate and contract with us.”
Churchill, who is working closely with Neifert, explained how they plan to pursue the organization’s expansion.
“What we want to do is ultimately pass a resolution in the coming weeks to show that the student body supports this,” Churchill said. “USG has a lot of direct contact with the administrators that we need to get this approved, such as DPS and Fire and Safety, there’s a lot of overlap between those that oversee EMSC and those that specifically the Wellness Affairs Committee works with.”
Churchill mentioned that they could put more pressure on the administration by showing support not only from EMSC, but also from the entire student body.
“This is a really important initiative for the student body, because there is that mean gap time which we have right now,” Churchill said. “Most of the transfers we have right now are alcohol-related. If we want to treat the students in the meantime, we need to expand this organization.”

The Honorable Leo E. Strine Jr., the eighth Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, spoke to the Gould School of Law students on Thursday about the implications of European Union and United States corporate law on stockholders.
The event marked the 2015 installment of the Justice Lester W. Roth lecture series.
Strine began his comparative law lecture by addressing the debate over whether E.U. or U.S. corporate law statutes are more stockholder friendly. He argued that the claim that E.U. policies better benefit stockholders relies too heavily on paper law as opposed to how it operates in practice.
“E.U. corporate law works better for stockholders like the Soviet Union protected human rights better than the United States,” Strine said.
He continued the talk by stating that those making the claim in favor of E.U. over U.S. corporate law ignore the reality of American corporate law — stockholders in the United States exercise legal and empowerment rights more frequently than E.U. stockholders.
Strine addressed the global discussion on whether the United States should adjust certain policies to more closely model E.U. corporate law. He emphasized how important it is to understand the social and regulatory context within which corporate governance operates. U.S. corporations, for example, focus solely on the well-being of their stockholders, whereas E.U. companies consider all constituents, including labor and creditors.
“Scholars in the United States have discussed the means of corporate governance,” Strine said. “And they confuse it with the question of whether focus on stockholder welfare is a primary end. In this respect, the U.S. may use a more republican model than the E.U., but it does so only to best advance its stockholders’ welfare.”
The lecture continued with Strine elaborating on the different end E.U. corporate law has compared to the United States.
It is the normative duty of E.U. company directors to take into account the interest of all constituencies. Strine provided the example of the German codetermination model in which employees sit in at least half of the seats on the advisory boards of large companies. He stated that practices, such as firms being required to regularly release company information to constituents, are common among the member nations of the E.U.
Contrastingly, a vast number of jurisdictions in the United States do not have constituency statutes; in the United States, the only constituency with legal rights are the stockholders. Labor is not required to have board seats or voting rights, and creditors only have influence in the case of solvency.
Strine then argued that despite E.U. stockholders appearing to have more influence than U.S. stockholders on paper, empirical evidence on the practical power of American stockholders suggests differently.
He said that U.S. corporate law allows for an environment that allows stockholders not only greater defensive action, but also more deals and transactions.
“You have to let the bidders feel like they can get a fair shake, and in many ways, it’s more difficult for bidders to operate in the E.U.,” Shrine said. “In the U.S., you have to be active. You have a duty … to try and explore the marketplace to make sure stockholders are getting the best deal.”
Strine ended by claiming that before the U.S. can decide to adopt E.U. corporate policies or vice versa, the context in which the law operates should be understood.
Andrew T. Guzman, dean of USC Gould, expressed how honored USC was to have Strine join the list of Roth Lecture speakers.
“Chief Justice Strine challenges convention,” Guzman said. “Looking at his judicial decisions is only part of the picture. He’s also without any question one of the leading commentators and voices on corporate law. It’s fair to say that there’s no one today who’s had a larger role in shaping and articulating corporate law in this country than Chief Justice Leo E. Strine.”
Prior to becoming the chief justice, Strine served on the Delaware Court of Chancery. While serving on the Court of Chancery, Strine wrote over a hundred opinions, particularly in the area of corporate law.
He was also counsel to Gov. Thomas R. Carper of the State of Delaware, a corporate litigator at the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and a law clerk to Judge Walter K. Stapleton and Chief Judge John F. Gerry.
Strine is one of the most overbearing “leaders: that the State of Delaware has ever had.  He gets overly involved in the legislative process , which raises serious ethics and separation of powers issues, but because he is part of the Delaware “good old boys” club, he gets away with anything he wants.  He has also been known to make inappropriate and lewd comments among his colleagues, which, if anyone else said them, would get them fired.  Having Guzman genuflect to him is downright embarrassing and sad.

The Viterbi School of Engineering and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has teamed up under Morteza Dehghani, assistant professor of psychology and computer science, to create Text Analysis, Crawling and Interpretation Tool.
TACIT allows research psychologists to analyze text from online sources, such as social media profiles. Its architecture allows use of multiple plugins, which will make textual analysis easier for researchers.
“Currently [text analysis] techniques are available as independent programs or software, but they require a lot of expertise and because social scientists often don’t have the programming background, they don’t use them,” Dehghani told USC News. “So we’ve created a very researcher-friendly environment where they can easily access and use these methods. And if they want more, anyone can write their own plugins for the system.”
This program has seen success internationally in the past year and a half because it is user-friendly and allows researchers to mold the program to their studies.
“In the first week the program launched there were over 2,500 hits to our website,” Dehghani told USC News. “We had people from Kenya to Vietnam, from Uruguay to Estonia and from Hawaii to Maine downloading the software.”
There are three primary components to the TACIT system: automated text collection, which parses through websites related to the computational linguistic or psychological study, storage and processing of formal bodies of text and the creation of data points for analysis.
TACIT required collaboration from psychological doctoral students Kate Johnson and Joe Hoover and eight computer scientists from the computer science department.
This program has many real-world applications apart from research. Health psychologists can use TACIT to prevent early signs of depression and suicide.
Since the advent of computers, textual analysis in the world of psychology has been growing rapidly, and with TACIT, USC remains ahead of the curve.

After a Halloween win in the Bay over quarterback Jared Goff and the California Golden Bears, the Trojans will return home to the Coliseum to host Arizona. The Trojans are riding a two game-win streak to improve to 5-3 while the Wildcats are coming off of two straight losses, falling to 5-4.
The last time these teams met, USC barely escaped a loss in Tucson, as No. 10 Arizona missed a last-second field goal that would have won the game. Since knocking off former No. 3 Utah, USC has moved up to third place in the Pac-12 South while Arizona is fifth, ahead of only Colorado.
Since taking over, interim head coach Clay Helton has slowed his team down and strayed from former head coach Steve Sarkisian’s fast-paced offense. Last week against Cal, the Trojans held Goff and the Bears offense to a season-low 61 plays and will likely bring that same approach to the Coliseum on Saturday.
“When you look at some of the teams that we are playing right now, these high-play teams, you’re trying to keep that ball away from them, steal a possession from them, limit a possession for them,” Helton said.
The defense fell flat against Stanford, Washington and Notre Dame, but since switching to a more controlled tempo, has been unwavering against Utah and Cal. A fast-paced offense puts a lot of pressure on the defense since the offense is limiting its time of possession. Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said that reducing the amount of time the defense is on the field will greatly reduce the margin of error, especially against a high-scoring team like Arizona.
“They are averaging over 500 yards of offense,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said. “They have scored a lot of points. They have been in the 90s and 100s in the play count, so they get a lot of plays.”
Arizona running back Jared Baker will try to capitalize on the defense’s Achilles heel — run game defense. Baker slowly grinds out yards on the ground and wears down defenses, something USC struggles to defend.
Arizona quarterback Jerrard Randall started in place of an injured Anu Solomon, but now that Solomon is healthy again, head coach Rich Rodriguez seems to favor some variation of the two of them. Neither one has been outstanding, so as long as USC’s defense is able to stop the run game and play through the fourth quarter, the Trojans shouldn’t have a problem getting a win.
“Our D-line and linebackers are playing lights-out right now,” said redshirt sophomore safety Chris Hawkins. “From here on out, we’re going to be needed a lot.”
On the other side of the ball, redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler is coming off a game against Cal in which he did not throw a touchdown pass. Kessler has seemingly been a non-factor in USC’s past two wins but will need a big game to make up for the potential absence of his favorite target, sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster.
“Right now you’ve got to plan for him not to be there,” Helton said of Smith-Schuster, who had surgery to repair a fracture in his hand on Monday. “We’re not going to put a kid out there who’s not ready. If he’s ready, he’s ready. If not, we’ll save him for the next game.”
Like Arizona, USC relies heavily on the run game under Helton, and especially if Smith-Schuster is out, the trio of tailbacks Justin Davis, Tre Madden and Ronald Jones will need to continue to exhaust the opposing defense. They haven’t met a defense who could stop them yet, and Arizona’s vulnerability isn’t likely to either.
But many USC players have said that more important than offense and defense is playing together.
“He has made us a real family,” Hawkins said.
Wide receiver Darreus Rogers echoed Hawkins’s thought, and added that Helton has given the Trojans something to play for.
“I believe in Coach Helton — we all believe in him — and we will do whatever it takes to win for him,” Rogers said.
Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. in the Coliseum. The game will be aired live on ESPN.

Riddled with lack of experience, growing pains and a rebuilding process the last two seasons, the USC men’s basketball team hopes to have all the right pieces in place for the 2015-2016 season and make a long-awaited return to relevancy in the Pac-12.
Head coach Andy Enfield is starting his third season at the helm, coming over from Florida Gulf Coast prior to the 2012-2013 season. While Enfield gained prominence for leading the Eagles to an improbable Sweet Sixteen run in the NCAA Tournament in 2013, he has not had the same success in his first two years with the Trojans.
USC is just 5-31 in conference play and 23-41 the last two seasons, and they placed last in the Pac-12 both years. Enfield chalks it up to a young, inexperienced roster.
“We allowed our players to play through their mistakes last season,” he said. “They were young and inexperienced. We were competitive last season. We just were not able to win a lot of close games.”
Indeed, the Trojans were the fourth-youngest team in the country last season, and one of just 15 teams in the country without a senior. This season, it will have just one senior — Strahinja Gavrilovic — but have its top nine scorers returning. In all, 10 players and all five starters from last season will be back.
“With a year of experience, bodies being more developed physically … and understanding how to win close games, we hope the growing pains we went through last season will show up as some more victories this season,” Enfield said.
Continuity is a theme heading into next Friday’s season opener, with players gaining more experience playing with each other.
“The last two years were a rebuilding process with a new coaching staff and new players, and we were trying to put everything in place,” said junior forward Nikola Jovanovic. “This year, with the right pieces, we’re covered in every single position. We feel comfortable going into the new season.”
Sophomore guard and co-captain Jordan McLaughlin will be counted on to build upon an outstanding freshman campaign where he averaged 12.1 points, 4.5 assists and 3.0 rebounds. A former four-star recruit with tremendous court vision, McLaughlin underwent offseason surgery on both shoulders after missing the final eight games of last season.
But the local product said he is healthy and ready to embrace his leadership role by being a good role model.
“I’m a leader by example,” McLaughlin said. “In the drills, I make sure I’m going hard. Every day I bring it at practice. I make sure I take no days off.”
McLaughlin is joined in the backcourt by redshirt junior Katin Reinhardt, who led the team in three-pointers (61) and three-point percentage (38.6 percent) last season. Sophomore Elijah Stewart, junior Julian Jacobs and sophomore co-captain Malik Marquetti are also key returning guards for the Trojans.
In the frontcourt, Jovanovic serves as a low-post presence, averaging 12.3 points per game and leading the team with 7.0 rebounds a game. The junior played for the Serbian National Team over the summer and cites consistency, relentless effort, and rebounding as points of emphasis for the season ahead.
“[Experience] was one of our issues last year,” Jovanovic said. “We weren’t able to win 7-8 games just because of [lack of experience]. I think this year we’re going to turn that around. We’ll definitely be good.”
The Trojans also added two highly-prized recruits in Chimenzie Metu and Bennie Boatwright, who are both tall and skilled big men. Metu is athletic and strong on defense while Boatwright, who could start as a freshman, is a 6’9” forward with an accurate three-point shot.
“They’ll help us out a lot,” McLaughlin said. “[Boatwright] is a stretch-four, pick-and-pop four. He’ll be able to space the floor on the pick-and-roll. [Metu] is a freak athlete who can jump out of the gym.”
Picked to finish 10th in the Pac-12 in a preseason media poll for the second consecutive season, USC hopes to do much better than that by becoming a competitive factor in the conference.
It begins with continuity and having more time to learn and absorb Enfield’s up-tempo system. The Trojans lost eight games last season by five points or less, a product of lack of experience and late-game execution.
“A couple games came down to the last couple of possessions,” McLaughlin said. “It’s not like we were getting blown out. This year, we’re focusing on executing better than last year. That way, we’ll be able to win those games that were close.”
That execution will have to be shared by all if USC is to have success.
“We don’t have a 20-point scorer on this team,” Enfield said. “What we have is a lot of good players that need to play together, and they all need to step up.”
The Trojans begin their season next Friday with a four-game homestand, kicking off the 2015-2016 campaign against San Diego at Galen Center.
Sorry to say inexperience is relative, and really an excuse. Kentucky wins titles with four or five Freshmen starting while Trojans
finish dead last in their conference two years in a row. Maybe if Enfield can keep his best player for a senior year outcomes
different in a few games at least. Make or break season for the Coach and staff.

Athletic Director Pat Haden does an excellent job taking care of USC’s 550 or so student-athletes on a daily basis.
“Can’t emphasize enough how great our lives as student-athletes are because of Pat Haden,” redshirt junior wide receiver Robby Kolanz said.
During his tenure, he has advocated for and followed through with guaranteed four-year scholarships and additional food stipends for USC student-athletes.
“We will do as much as we possibly can for our student-athletes,” Haden said in an interview with the Daily Trojan last month.
While the well being of student-athletes has been his number one priority over the past five years, I’m glad to see he’s taking measures to address his own health concerns moving forward as well.
He took a step in doing so when resigning from the College Football Playoff selection committee last Friday, citing the advisement of his doctor to reduce his traveling. The 62-year-old Haden would have traveled to Dallas, Texas, earlier this week to deliberate with his fellow committee members to produce the first edition of this year’s playoff rankings. It would have been the first of multiple weekly trips to the Lone Star state for Haden.
“It takes up a lot of time,” Haden said.
Haden did the right thing in stepping down not only in the best interest of the CFP and USC, but also for himself.
I was about 50 feet away from Haden on the sidelines of Notre Dame Stadium in the minutes before USC took on the Irish on a cold and brisk night. A friend and I were taking in the Trojans warmups when we looked over and saw Haden on one knee.
Initially, it appeared to me as if he was simply engaging in a pregame prayer like many of the players do — seemingly appropriate after the events that had transpired earlier that week, though, that was unfortunately not the case.
We continued to look on, however, and medical personnel rushed to Haden’s side because it later became known that he was feeling lightheaded. Haden later checked out fine and tweeted the next day that he was feeling great but not before he scared the living crap out of me.
That same night, after USC’s 10-point loss to the Irish, I went before Touchdown Jesus and said a prayer for him.
Since that night in South Bend, Haden has not been present at either of USC’s last two games — both resulting in wins for the Trojans.
His health, however, hasn’t stopped others from calling for Haden’s job for different reasons.
Some have called for Haden’s resignation for his handling of the hiring and termination of former head coach Steve Sarkisian.
With all that he’s accomplished and done for this Athletics Department, he doesn’t deserve to have to step down — nor do I want him to step down — however, the current state of his health raises concerns.Remember that Haden, who has a pacemaker, was hospitizalized in August 2014.
While he continues to deal with his own health issues, they seemingly haven’t stopped him from being able to be involved in so many different facets.
An L.A. Times article published last month communicated that Haden holds more than a dozen other roles, a number of those coming in corporate and nonprofit board capacities.
As a senior student whose been juggling different positions and obligations for his entire college career, I honestly understand where Haden is coming from.
Haden’s been a multitasker his entire life so why would he stop now?
The famous Mark Twain put it all into perspective when he said, “age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter.”
Haden’s been able to balance his commitments more than three times longer than I have in my life, but even I feel that I’m invincible at times. I’m sure he’s felt the same way.
It’s a mindset -— one that is derived, based on my personal experiences, from juggling multiple roles for so many years.
But at some point, being so versatile might cause all of the wear that eventually takes its toll on our bodies, regardless of how well adapted we are.
The toughest thing to do sometimes is to start putting our feet on the brakes.

If you had to plot USC’s performance this season on a graph, it would be all over the place. The statistics do no better job of explaining the Trojans’ varied performance this year than any reasoning or logic. However, a close look at some of the numbers give some indication of what the Trojans need to focus on going forward to be successful.
With an overall record of 5-3, the Trojans fall short of both the AP Top 25 poll and the first top 25 poll from the College Football Playoff committee. Though not mathematically impossible, USC’s chances at making the national payoff are quite bleak.
But somehow, USC is ranked at No. 5 in ESPN’s football power index. With an FPI of 22.7, the Trojans trail only Ohio State, Oklahoma, TCU and Baylor in that poll, all of which, besides Oklahoma, are undefeated. It puts them ahead of Clemson and LSU, the two undefeated teams atop the CFP’s first poll, which have respective FPIs of 22.4 and 22.1.
The FPI gives USC a 33.2 percent chance of winning out the rest of the year and a 30.9 percent chance of winning the conference. Though ahead of No. 13 Stanford in the poll, which scored at 18.9 in the FPI, the Cardinal are listed as having a 51.2 percent chance of winning the Pac-12. Utah is the next up in the conference at No. 20 with a 15.0 FPI, followed by UCLA at No. 22 with a score of 14.7.
Utah leads the Trojans by a game in the conference standings, despite USC’s head-to-head win, and UCLA controls its own destiny for the conference championship because the Bruins also trail Utah by just a game but have yet to meet Utah head-to-head.
The poll, however, still has USC as the favorite out of the Pac-12 South to win the conference, with Utah having a 14.3 percent chance of winning the conference and UCLA having only a 3.2 percent chance.
If Utah loses one of its next four games, then the Trojans would control their own destiny because of their head-to-head win over Utah and their season finale with the Bruins, and the FPI doesn’t think either Utah or UCLA has a great shot of finishing the season undefeated.
The Utes are given only a 7 percent chance of winning out, and UCLA is given only a 3.2 percent chance of doing so.
The numbers must show something beyond the feel-good storyline that the Trojans are turning their season around behind interim coach Clay Helton after experiencing a lot of off-the-field issues in the first half of the season, which the committee members and AP voters are not oblivious to.
However, even if the Trojans are now a top-five team in the nation, the polls must reflect USC’s overall performance to some degree, and not just be a projection on future performance, so there should be some disparity between the projections and the rankings.
Nonetheless, the FPI numbers should give Trojan fans great confidence in USC’s chances of at least making a Rose Bowl this year.
Yes, there are four big tests left before then, plus some measures outside of the Trojans’ control. There’s no doubt USC will get up for the UCLA game, but even supreme motivator Ed Orgeron couldn’t get past them, and Clay Helton has to prove that he can keep the Trojans focused on all three of the lesser tests before then, including Arizona this weekend.
But when the Trojans are playing at their best, like they have been under Helton, they truly are one of the best teams in the country. The proof is in the numbers.

After dropping their first match of the season last Friday, the No. 2-ranked USC women’s volleyball team will look to start a new winning streak this weekend when Colorado and Utah come to town for two big conference matchups.
The Trojans will battle against the Buffaloes on Friday at 8 p.m. before they face the Utes on Sunday at 11 a.m. in the Galen Center.
USC (23-1, 11-1 Pac-12) had their 22-match winning streak and the fourth-best start in program history snapped by No. 5-ranked Washington last weekend in Seattle. It was a challenging road trip for the Women of Troy, who were playing their second consecutive week away from home.
Luckily, the team and head coach Mick Haley will get some much needed rest and stay home for the next four matches.
“We have taken two days off this week … we really needed to recover from those two trips up north,” Haley said. “Hopefully we can get back healthy and get rested up with this home stand.”
Colorado (14-10, 6-6) was one of just three teams to push the Trojans to five sets this season when they did so back in early October. In that match, four USC players had at least 15 kills in one of the team’s most balanced offensive outputs all season. Senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the team with 17 kills, while three other players — senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie and freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford — all tallied then-career highs of 15 kills apiece.
“[The Buffs] played us very tough out in Colorado,” Haley said. “That was our first five-game match of the year, and they were really playing well. We expect them to come in here to be ready to go on Friday, so we need to be really good.”
Utah (9-14, 3-9) will also be looking to avenge their early season loss against the Women of Troy back in Salt Lake City. That match saw Bricio lead USC once again with 17 kills, as the Trojans outhit (.243 to .073) and out blocked (10 to 3) the Utes to collect the 3-0 sweep. USC also leads the all-time series against the Utes, 14-2, and have won nine of the last 10 meetings.
“We have to turn around with Homecoming and all of that and play Utah on Sunday morning,” Haley said. “That’s ‘Dads and Daughters’ Day [in the Galen Center], so it’s going to be an unbelievable home weekend. The players are just going to have to stay focused and stay with it.”
The next two matches could also be big for the senior All-American Bricio.
The 6-foot-2 attacker is close to breaking the school record for kills, which was set by Alex Jupiter (2008-11) with 1,918 career kills. Bricio needs just 64 kills to surpass Jupiter and would move into 10th place in Pac-12 history if she did so this weekend.
USC will honor all-time greats Toni Anderson and Katie Olsovsky, members of the 2002 and 2003 NCAA championship teams, in between sets two and three of the Colorado match on Friday.
The team has a one game winning streak already. Guess beating WSU doesn’t count in your math equation.
 It is time for Haley to step up and correct some short comings which were more than evident on last road trip.

Homecoming spirit is in the air, but that isn’t going to stop the No. 4-ranked men’s water polo team from honoring their two seniors.  The team will honor Gerrit Hill and Mac Carden in a brief ceremony before the Trojans take on No. 7 UC Irvine on Sunday.
Senior Day is always an emotional game, and this year is no different.  Though the team is not losing a large quantity of players, they will be losing players with significant NCAA championship experience.
“One thing that is really special is that Mac decided to come back for his fifth year,” said redshirt senior Gerrit Hill. “He has a few rings under his belt, and I was lucky enough to be a part of the 2013 national championship team. So we’re both happy to be back for our fifth year and hopefully win another one.”
This class was able to experience the back end of the Trojans championship dynasty that has led to winning six of the last seven national championships.
“It’s an honor, I couldn’t ask for anything better,” said Hill of the special relationship he and Carden have developed as the lone seniors on the team.  “Mac is a really good friend, I am happy to have such a great friendship with him.”
The Men of Troy won’t just be bidding their seniors adieu; they will also attempt to say goodbye to their two game losing streak.
The Trojans will be coming home to Uytengsu following a stretch of three straight road games. Of these games, the Trojans will be coming off two consecutive losses to MPSF teams. Last weekend the Men of Troy lost a shootout to then No. 4 Cal 10-12, but the team is ready to bounce back.
“The guys are super hyped for this Sunday. Everyone is coming back with a lot of fire,” Hill said.  “We’ve been training really hard this week. Jovan is on our case, and it’s just fueling our fire.”
The Anteaters are 11-9 overall with a 1-5 MPSF record. They too are coming off of a losing stretch having lost to both UC Santa Barbara and Stanford last week.
Before the team will get a crack at the Anteaters, the water polo team will celebrate their homecoming with a splash. The team will host their annual alumni game at Uytengsu Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m.
According to Hill, what may seem to be a relaxing and fun game is actually quite the serious business affair. Nearly all of the alumni are returning with multiple NCAA championships and take great pleasure in the opportunity for one more shot at glory.
“They’re coming back with multiple rings on their fingers, you know, trying to show off what they’ve got,” Hill said.
The Trojans are ready to meet the challenge however, and will not let their former teammates pull of the upset.
“We still take it as a regular game, you can’t take anything lightly, especially when we are going into a game Sunday,” Hill said. “It is a fun atmosphere playing with guys that you played with before, but we always go out in the water to win, everyone is competitive.”

The Blacklist · Actor Bryan Cranston plays Dalton Trumbo, a successful screenwriter during Hollywood’s Golden Age. The film depicts Trumbo’s ban from working in the movie industry and his fight to get his work on the screen. In turn, Trumbo chose to ghost write movies such as Roman Holiday. – Photo courtesy of Bleeker Street Media
Trumbo, the film about the life and achievements of iconic screenwriter and McCarthy Era activist Dalton Trumbo, makes its way to theaters on Nov. 6. A household name in the film industry, Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) becomes blacklisted — shunned and ostracized by the film industry — and imprisoned for his pro-communist views. Trumbo was a member of the communist party in the United States during the rise of anti-communist sentiment among the public that continued into the Cold War. The film accurately portrays the tense social and political climate during the Red Scare that plagued much of American society during the era and spilled over into the entertainment industry.
Director Jay Roach vividly captures the wave of McCarthyism sweeping Congress and the public in several scenes. Roach does so by changing from 1950s
black-and-white news segments to color re-enactments of Congressional hearings. This format adds flavor to the political drama.
Meanwhile, the masterful script illustrates Trumbo’s dealings with the rest of the blacklisted members, known as the Hollywood Ten. These sequences are authentic and get under the audience’s skin when it becomes apparent that the blacklist members’ freedoms are being taken away. Adding to the tension, segments of the film feature direct interviews with the Trumbo family, who are genuine in their descriptions
of what happened.
Additionally, the pairing of Louis C.K. and Cranston is excellent. C.K. plays fellow screenwriter Arlen Hird, a
straight-laced role in the film, and his character delivers great support in his central relationship with Cranston’s Trumbo. Together, the two battle through tense hearings with the House Un-American Activities Committee. They also debate among themselves to try to keep from selling out to avoid sentencing. This dynamic took what could have been an unfocused, dry, legal battle into a well-designed display of the fight against the Red Scare and disregard for their First Amendment Rights.
Trumbo and his allies then seek to re-start their careers by submitting screenplays under pen names while also subtly changing the cultural climate toward the blacklist. Trumbo actually wrote classic films such as The Brave One and Exodus under pseudonyms, while Spartacus was considered the turning point in the blacklist era. The portrayal of the writing of these films and their production, as well as public reception in that time period, is so immersive that it’s easy to get lost in the moment with it. On the other hand, Trumbo’s squabbles with elite society, the press, the government and his manager, Frank King (John Goodman), also add entertainment as he trades his humble and diplomatic persona for some very witty and well-timed remarks that make the film more memorable.
Cranston might have drawn upon his time in Breaking Bad for his talented involvement with a much more tender side of Trumbo’s life: his family. The pressure of being under scrutiny during the blacklist and being dehumanized for his political beliefs is a challenge for Trumbo in the film. It, at times, takes a toll on the family, and Cranston stays true to form in both his efforts and faults to protect his family. Trumbo’s daughter, played by Elle Fanning, is often a source of his inspiration. Cranston and Fanning’s chemistry as family
on-screen never seems hollow.
Trumbo could almost be an analogy to the life of a rock star or a professional athlete who has a setback and works his way back to success. But the story of Dalton Trumbo and the Hollywood Ten was a very real attack on basic freedom of expression in Hollywood that was compromised during a turbulent political climate. As Trumbo says, “It will do no good to search for villains or heroes or saints or devils because there were none; there were only victims.” Trumbo balances the performance from being too much of a documentary, with a message that rings true today — one of freedom of expression. Individuals across the world are persecuted for speaking their minds. Trumbo celebrates that right in an entertaining tale.

EXPOSURE, a yearly skate competition and event celebrating women in skateboarding, will take place Saturday in Encinitas, California.
EXPOSURE was established in 2012 by USC alumna and professional skateboarder Amelia Brodka two years after creating her film UNDEREXPOSED: A Women’s Skateboarding Documentary, which she earned course credit for while studying at USC. A part of a selection of film festivals — including Frequency Film Fest, Indie Film Fest and Thin Line Film Fest — and the winner of Best Documentary at USC Web Fest in 2012, Brodka’s documentary centered on the lack of exposure and support for women in the world of skateboarding, which she had experienced firsthand. After the success of the documentary, Brodka was inspired to continue supporting women in skate and created the EXPOSURE event, furthering opportunities to showcase the talent of these women and encouraging girls to get involved.
“The documentary ends in a call-to-action, which states that if you want to see something happen you have to create it yourself,” Brodka said. “A lot of the documentary focused on the lack of events, so I partnered with Lesli Cohen, and we started the EXPOSURE event and then turned it into a nonprofit two years later.”
The event is certainly bigger than ever. EXPOSURE is currently the largest women’s skateboarding event, and has the biggest prize purse of any all-female skate competition at $20,000. This year’s event will feature 100 of the world’s top female skateboarders participating in vert, bowl and street events and competitions. However, the fact that the event celebrates women does not mean men are not invited.
“Our clinics are gender-inclusive. Top male pros come to sign autographs, and a lot of our volunteers are male,” Brodka said.
Saturday’s event will include a variety of activities, including learn to skate clinics, spin art, a tech deck hunt, raffles, a yoga clinic and a large scale vendor village.
Though the event features both professional and amateur competitions and is geared toward the skateboarding community, Brodka assured that those who don’t skate are welcome to attend, participate and get involved on all levels, through donating online, spreading the word about the event or volunteering. Brodka also explained the international appeal of the event.
“EXPOSURE is an event that gets all of the top female skateboarders in the world together to share their passion,” Brodka said. “In the future, we plan to expand to multiple events around the world.”
The event is set to begin at 8 a.m and end at 5 p.m. Amateur competitions start at 8:30 a.m., 10 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. in both 14 & Under and 15 & Over divisions, with professional vert, street and bowl competitions starting at 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., respectively. Tickets are not required for attendance. However, those interested in competing in events and participating in either the skate or yoga clinics can register on EXPOSURE’S website at exposureskate.org. Proceeds from the event support survivors of domestic violence.

The fans have been calling, and Miike Snow has finally answered. After three years of silence, the Swedish-American pop trio released new music with their single “Heart is Full.” True to their genre-blending style band, members Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt have created something beautifully chaotic.
The track starts off sampling soul vocals, which are placed throughout the three-minute song. Then the auto-tuned vocals of band members are infused with a drum loop to give it a
pop-rock sound. These competing aesthetics meld together to create a catchy beat.
Lyrically, the song is nothing special. In the chorus alone, the group croons “My heart is full of you” four times. After about three verses, the phrase becomes a little overplayed. Furthermore, it lacks the poetic storytelling of their previous hits, which takes away from the sound Miike Snow had curated with songs such as “Silvia” and “Animals.”
However, the production is incredibly unique and has left fans completely questioning the tone of the new album. The dark use of drums and the hazy vocals is certainly a departure from the dancey beat behind “Animal,” which is perhaps their most
well-known song. There is definitely more electronic undertones, but it will ultimately remain true to their dark pop sound.
This new album has been a long time coming. In April of this year, the group began to post odd images on the Facebook page captioned, “Something’s coming …” before returning to silence. However, as promised they again took to social media to announce their upcoming album writing, “We know you’ve been waiting … our new track ‘Heart is Full’ is coming soon. Stay Tuned.” And the fans patiently awaited.
The album’s release date still remains a mystery, but it is speculated to become available from late 2015 to early 2016. The group worked on it while traveling between New York, Los Angeles and Stockholm. These three distinct cities are sure to have significant influence over the sound and inspiration for each song. In an interview with Consequence of Sound, Winnberg stated that the album is “the most innovative and creatively unified work thus far.”
Having stepped out of the spotlight as soon as they reemerged, Miike Snow is the ultimate tease. Be on the lookout for their newest album and listen to “Heart Is Full.” There is a unique combination of new and old elements in the track, which is sure to please both their cult following and new listeners.

Recently, there have been an astounding number of new books released. With so many different titles receiving critical acclaim and winning various coveted prizes, it can be difficult to decide what to read first. At the end of the day, I try to strike a balance between reading something completely new and foreign to me and choosing what I read based on what I’ve enjoyed in the past. I’ve been looking through some of the most highly anticipated new releases, many of which remind me of some classic novels.
If you loved Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll, you should read After Alice by Gregory Maguire.
I have to confess, I was never a great fan of Carroll’s original novel. I remember reading it in elementary school, so maybe I just didn’t have the maturity to appreciate it. However, After Alice comes from the author of Wicked, and if that doesn’t pique your interest, then I don’t know what will. With this being the 150th anniversary of Alice’s fall down a rabbit hole and adventure in a magical, surreal world, Maguire decided to spin a new story inspired by the timeless original. In this story, Alice’s friend Ada, an unattractive and hunchback girl who is mentioned very briefly in the original novel, arrives late to visit Alice and falls down the fated rabbit hole herself. She embarks on a magical and treacherous journey to find Alice and bring her safely home. One of the most exciting aspects of this story is Maguire’s leaping between the punch-drunk world of Wonderland and the equally absurd reality of Victorian Oxford. This is a wonderful new work of mastery for all Wonderland lovers. I am very much excited by this new book, with its decadent examination of Victorian life, especially in the highly charged environment of Oxford, as well as the magic and whimsy of Carroll’s adored world.
If you loved In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, you should read A Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James.
To be fair, you should probably read this book whether you liked, or even read Capote’s iconic novel. In Cold Blood is one of my all-time favorite classic novels, so James’ newest book is definitely something that’s been on my radar for a while. This book has been receiving critical acclaim for weeks and recently won the Man Booker Prize, so if you haven’t heard about it yet, you definitely will in the very near future. The reason I compare this book about the attempted assassination of Bob Marley and a rich exploration of Jamaican history and culture to Capote’s Midwestern murder story is that, firstly, they are both retellings of true events. To me, one of the most fantastic and alluring aspects of fiction is its ability to tell a story we all know in a new and fascinating way. The ability to learn about historical events while also allowing yourself to become immersed in a beautiful story is something that, as I’ve mentioned before, makes literature so unique. Something else about In Cold Blood I really enjoyed was the alternating of perspectives between the heartbroken town ripped apart by the murder of a
well-loved family and the attempt to track down their killers and then the story of two murderers on the run. I enjoyed how changing perspectives both breaks up the narrative and makes it more readable, but also allows us to empathize with both the victims and the murderers, creating an exciting and also very complicated moral dilemma for the reader. James also uses the technique of altering perspectives of politicians, killers and witnesses of the attempted crime, drug dealers, the FBI and even ghosts. This gritty book looks at the heart of gang violence, power, poverty and even glamor in an incredibly complex culture. James’ writing is lyrical in itself, and this book is not only set to become an important part of literary history but is also a joy to read.
If you loved The Crucible by Arthur Miller, you should read The Witches: Salem 1692 by Stacy Schiff.
I don’t know of anyone who loved reading The Crucible, as most people were forced to read it in high school. I borrowed in from my school library because  I was fascinated by the Salem Witch Trials at the time.  I got about a page and a half into the play before giving up. It was incredibly dense and felt pretty medieval and boring. The only time I really got anything out of the play was when I watched Richard Armitage act in it on stage in London. This new book by Stacy Schiff is for people like me, who are completely enthralled in the story of the Salem witches, but haven’t found a truly enjoyable piece of literature that portrays this period in history. Stacy Schiff is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Cleopatra, and in this newest novel she brings yet another captivating and horrific historical event to life through her fantastic narrative and style. This novel follows the story of the Salem witches, concocting it into a psychological thriller, sure to inform and entertain any reader.

Whenever we really love a song, it’s important to us to listen to it up to a million times. We’ll put it on repeat while studying, working out or even staring at the ceiling and taking in just how great it is. Some of the catchiest guilty song pleasures can be found on most of the top 40 lists, songs that everyone loves to belt out. Musicians and fans alike seem to love to create their own arrangements of popular songs. 
Out on Youtube right now are thousands of versions of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry radio hits, but are any of them worth listening to? Here are some of the best covers of the songs you’ve heard blowing up the radio.
There’s no doubt about the sweet romance of this power duo radio hit, but musical couple Us the Duo’s cover gives John and Meghan a run for their money. Their simple, broken down version allows both artists to show off their unique sound. With beautiful and clean voices bringing to reality an innovative arrangement, this cover amps up the sweetness of this already adorable song.
If I could I would put every Pentatonix cover on this list, but that’s not quite fair. However, this is easily one of my favorite covers of theirs. The group’s dynamic, musical genius and ingenuity used to recreate the fun energy of this song goes perfectly with the talent of these five talents. The quality of the song overall makes it one of my favorite covers of all time.
Shawn Mendes, a young newcomer to the music scene, took this British pop hit and really ran with it. Shawn’s cover adds that raspy acoustic style that goes perfectly with his rock-tinged voice. For a young pop-singer, he definitely stole the show with this edgy version of our favorite British boy band’s newest tune.
The young pop star Tori Kelly has arguably one of the most interesting and beautiful voices on the radio right now. This top song hit the charts with a bam and so did this cover by singer Jacob Moran. His remarkable voice dances through the song in a way that challenges Tori’s original arrangement. His riffs and vibrato really are more musical than anything I’ve heard lately.
Oftentimes, it’s difficult to take an electronic song and turn it into a more acoustic broken down version. Not only does Runaground do so, but the quality of the song is also radio-worthy. A soft piano background to a lovely voice gives this cover a top spot on this list, taking it from a party hit to a play-at-home favorite.
Justin Bieber came back strong with a catchy song like “What do you Mean?” but Kina Granis and KHS redefined the song with their creative cover, utilizing different kinds of household items to make the base of the song, something that adds to its creative ingenuity. Kina sings with gentle elegance that adds even more unique spunk to this cover.
Kiana really brings a beautiful and soulful R&B twist to this cover, belting out the chorus in a way that changes the narrative of the song from rap to soul. If you ever need to listen to a smooth and silky track, this cover is the real deal.
For you rock and metal lovers out there, this cover is a perfect mix of a pop song taken to a punk level. The song definitely doesn’t lose its catchiness. In fact, the lyrics go really well with the punk approach of the song.
When it comes to Ed Sheeran, it’s difficult to find people who cover his songs and sing them as well as he does. One of the only covers I’ve ever liked of this song is by Boyce Avenue, largely because the lead singer, Alejandro Manzano, has a voice that’s somewhat similar to Ed’s. Boyce’s cover is definitely the best, featuring beautiful guitar playing and a strong vocal performance.
Another Vine star, Rachel Bobbit is known for her soft and alt-rock type voice that has stunned all her listeners. Her arrangement of this song is truly unique, especially when supported by her soft, haunting voice.

In late October, USC officially announced a $270 million plan to renovate the Coliseum. Pending approval, renovations will begin at the end of the 2017 season to be completed for the 2019 season.
The renovations — which include replacing every seat; installing handrails; building a new press box, suites and luxury boxes; and upgrading Wi-Fi capacity in the stadium — will be the first since earthquake repairs in 1994 and the construction of a new press box in 1995. The renovations will more than fulfill USC’s commitment to $100 million in improvements to the Coliseum by 2054 and will benefit both the Trojan Family and greater Los Angeles in the long term.
The proposed improvements are not without controversy. The changes will reduce the number of seats from 93,607 to 77,500, and critics have pointed out that the renovations focus heavily on building new luxury suites that will benefit a small percentage of attendees. In addition, some consider a $270 million commitment to a stadium that USC only leases unnecessary when tuition hikes, faculty wages and costly construction of the USC Village are such hot topics on campus.
These concerns, however, are vastly outweighed by the benefits of the renovation. The Coliseum is the ninth-largest college football stadium in the country, the largest in the Pac-12, and is a nearly 100-years-old institution fundamentally tied to USC’s highest-revenue sport. Renovating the stadium reminds Trojans that, even in this post-Carroll era slump, the USC football program is still relevant.
Though there have been periods in USC’s history when the Coliseum would sell out, it is rare, and in the past several years USC has been averaging attendance well below capacity. Reducing the number of seats will make USC’s lease on the Coliseum more cost effective, and the stadium will still be larger than most in college football.
Even though these spots are in part being replaced by more luxury seating, the stadium stands to improve for everybody regardless. Right now, luxury tents stand on the field as an eyesore, and the press box has been criticized as having an inadequate view of the field. Though more luxury seating — including “suites, loge boxes, club seats, a new concourse and a new press box,” according to the USC Ripsit blog — could mean fewer regular season tickets, streamlining the Coliseum’s layout stands to improve the aesthetic without impacting attendance, given current numbers.
The high cost of the renovation will also not negatively impact students or University academics. According to a press release, the Athletics Department will fund the project entirely “from capital gifts, sponsorship revenue, non-USC events at the Coliseum and donor naming opportunities.” Student tuition will be unaffected, as will overall University funds that will go toward students’ education.
Beyond USC, the renovations will make Los Angeles even more relevant as a sports city, which could be increasingly important in the next decade. In September, Mayor Eric Garcetti delivered a bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics to the International Olympic Committee in person. Given the role of USC housing and the Coliseum in the 1984 Olympics, a renovation of the Coliseum combined with increased housing in the new USC Village would ensure L.A. is a top contender.
A new and improved Coliseum would also draw attention to L.A. as a home for an NFL team. In an interview with NBC, Athletic Director Pat Haden said that University officials have discussed the Coliseum as an NFL stadium with at least one professional team, and that even before renovations the stadium could serve as a team’s temporary location, which would likely lead to a more permanent deal. Getting an NFL team involved would both cut costs and add to Los Angeles’s legitimacy as an Olympics host, as well as create another huge source of revenue and entertainment for the city.
The Coliseum is a long-standing symbol of USC, an icon central to the legendary football program that generates massive revenue for the University — as such, it is not a waste for the University to spend a considerable amount on renovations. Not only will these improvements help USC in the long run, but they will also add to the notion that Los Angeles is a world-class sports city. The potential economic benefits are far greater than the reduced capacity or the inconvenience it may cause for just a few years.

If you know anything about California right now, you know the state is facing a severe — albeit man-made — drought. For the past four years, 37 million Californians in our state have suffered from the impacts of extreme to exceptional levels of drought throughout the region. In an effort to reverse current California Gov. Jerry Brown’s failed action on water policies, a local Northern Californian farmer named Dean Cortopassi has invested in creating a 2016 ballot measure that seeks to ensure that any large-scale projects, such as the Delta pipeline, that cost over $2 billion with revenue bonds must receive approval from voters, according to the Los Angeles Times. This initiative will spark an increase in transparency that will compel Brown to face the decisions he irresponsibly made in the past. Unfortunately, while this bill seeks to resolve issues with local farmers present since the start of Brown’s term, it fails to recognize that halting large water projects may make it more difficult to reverse the issue at hand: low levels of water supply. But California needs to institute comprehensive legislation that will ensure water supply security, not only for the present, but also for the future.
Recently, policy leaders and Californians have become all too familiar with the concept that if California suffers economically then so will the nation. Due to the drought, California will spend roughly $3 billion dollars and shed nearly 21,000 jobs, according to a recent study by University of California Davis. And with increased spending comes deficits in other arenas in the economy — accounting for significant job loss in both the agricultural and farming industries. Brown has taken drastic emergency measures to reverse the harsh effects of the drought; 26 percent of water has been reduced during Brown’s four month plan to decrease water usage by 25 percent. But more needs to be done.
The current water shortage in California reflects the inadequacies of liberal policy leaders who have failed to take action in restoring new water sources as the state continued to grow. The drought is purely man-made and was, in fact, preventable. For instance, according to WatchDog, more than half of the state’s water resources flow out to the San Francisco Bay and to the Pacific Ocean.
“What we’re seeing — water releases to benefit a small number of common fish, removing dams along major rivers, delays of desalination plants, failure to build adequate water storage — is not an anomaly,” Steven Greenhut wrote in the WatchDog. “It is the cumulative effect of water policies dominated by environmental interests.”
But things might be looking good for the future, if both the national House and the Senate can agree to halt state officials from pursuing threats to violate California water law.
This is the time for policy leaders in our state to be committed to cheap, clean water via the institution of reservoirs that ensure hydro-electricity practices. This is not the time, however, to institute a policy similar to Brown’s — extreme government regulated water shortages, water rationing and colossal water prices at the expense of the agricultural and farming industry. Currently, the California water system is fit to serve 22 million people, yet our state holds 38 million. Policy leaders should analyze what can be done to alleviate the burdens of the unequal distribution of water that provides a disservice to 16 million Californians. It’s not about the short-term — it’s about the long-term. And with that mindset, Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate must pass legislation that work toward creating sustainable water resources, rather than enforcing emergency water rationing among Californians.
Efforts to reinvigorate the state’s economy hinges on looking at methodologies that prevent future water shortages. The Western Water and American Food Security bill’s focus on working to ensure that the creation of new water supply systems not be delayed, inadvertently works in opposition to Cortopassi’s proposed measure.  It also ensures that the Bureau of Reclamation conduct feasibility studies within the period of three years of a $3 million or more project being completed. Specifically speaking, measures similar to H.R. 2898 must be advocated for. Provisions such as increased transparency, evaluations on corrective actions for dam maintenance inspections, all of which are included under H.R. 2898 must be mirrored, and if members of the Senate want to alleviate California’s water shortage, they, too, must recognize the merit in the Western Water and American Food Security bill.

Last week, Harvard Law School announced its “Free the Law” project, a program aimed at making one of the world’s largest collections of United States case law entirely free, digitized and publicly accessible. Harvard is partnering with Ravel Law, an online legal search platform, to scan a total of 40,000 books and distribute the documents on the internet by 2017.
This is a momentous victory for those in favor of more widely accessible information. Though the information will not be fully publicly available until 2023, the movement to provide free and comprehensive legal documents is cause enough to celebrate. As Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law at Harvard, put it: “Libraries were founded as an engine for the democratization of knowledge … The materials in the [Harvard] library’s collection tell a story that goes back to the founding of America, and we’re proud to preserve and share that story.”
But Harvard should not be the only university to make important and historical information accessible. USC has a large volume of European Union documents from as far back as 1951 that are not made public through the University. In addition to these legal documents, USC’s libraries also have an extensive collection of older books that are no longer required by classes, such as the third edition of Erwin Chemerinsky’s Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies. Books like these are only sparingly used in classes, and have often been replaced by newer editions. The University ought to make these outdated versions available online for free, at least for students.
The information in Chemerinsky’s book and others is not useless just because the text has been updated. Yet, most classes require the newest versions of texts, and so old books like Chemerinsky’s are simply using up space in libraries and are not being fully utilized. If these books were made publicly available through USC, or just opened up to student perusal through the library website, the books would be serving their original purpose — the dissemination of knowledge — to a much greater degree.
There should be broader discussion of potential ramifications if wider application of Harvard’s strategy is to be pursued, however. A balance must be maintained between the providers of knowledge and those that stand to benefit from it. And so, rather than depriving publishers, authors and researchers of their livelihoods and income, greater digitization should incorporate a method of securing loyalties, subscriptions or other forms of payment. However, this should be handled by the university — individual users should not be subjected to prices similar to those charged for purchasing or renting the physical book.
Of course, it makes sense for professors to require the most recent information on their course material. That information, however, can also be digitally distributed temporarily to students in the class to be used for the duration of the course, much like checking out a book from a library. Thus, the key course material that is shared between old and new editions can be made permanently available online through the libraries, and newer, specific material can be temporarily distributed.
If the University pursued an initiative like the one outlined, it would not only make information more widely available, but it would also have the benefit of assisting students who cannot afford the newest textbooks for their classes. As the Daily Trojan previously explored the exorbitant cost of college textbooks, an initiative like this could address the concerns of students who are worried about their budgets for books and supplies.
The University should take on more initiatives to circulate knowledge more widely. Even if only students reap the initial benefits, a program like the one started by Harvard Law School can have a long-lasting positive impact on public perception of the University and its reputation. For these reasons, the University should consider following Harvard’s example and making a greater number of documents more available to students and the public.

Running has always been a way that I take a mental break from the world around me. It’s the time I allocate for myself to stop, breathe and just focus on my body and myself. One could say that it’s similar to meditation as I put in my headphones and disappear from everything for the duration of my run. It’s my time to focus on myself.
Because of how running makes me feel, in addition to my love of adventure, I decided take on the Nike Women’s Half Marathon in San Francisco a few weeks ago — for the second time. I wanted to have that incredible feeling of working so immensely hard for something and then seeing my progress come full circle. This time around, I got the same feeling of fulfillment from accomplishing this goal, but there was something unique about doing the half marathon for the second time.
Before the race, I was apprehensive. I was worried that my second experience running a half marathon wouldn’t bring the same sense of fulfillment that it did the previous year. However, what I learned is that anything, whether it be an experience like this or an activity that is part of your daily routine, has the ability to have a greater impact if you maintain the correct mindset.
I believe that this heightened sense of fulfillment and accomplishment all came down to my runner’s mind. I felt like this time around I wasn’t just running 13.1 miles in a foreign, beautiful city; I was immersing myself in an entirely new experience. It wasn’t just this physical activity but something so much greater. I was connecting with my surroundings, I was taking in the people, I was being present as I took each stride forward through the streets, and I was very much mindful of the holistic experience it was giving me. Having a runner’s mind is just that — having the mental toughness to see past the physical pain and carry a strong, positive mindset that can take you toward your goal.
What I have come to learn from it all is that running is a mental game just as much as it is a physical one. Organically, our bodies are built to adapt to fight or flight situations when we sustain a high level of intense activity. We can train to reach a higher level of physical ability, but to make your way across the finish line, the best runners take extra care to train their brains, focusing on their minds to be as strong as any other muscle in the body.
As author Kristin Meekhof wrote in a blog for the Huffington Post, “It’s not difficult to follow a schedule and log the necessary miles, but to run well, you have to train your mind to work for you when the going gets tough.”
Mental toughness gives us the ability to beat the pain of running and sore muscles, it’s what keeps us going back through the immense fatigue and misery that strikes our bodies physically as we push it to its limits.
To be a mentally tough runner with a positive mentality it comes down to taking everything one thing at a time. One step at a time, one mile at a time, small goals until you reach a larger goal. Don’t think about what you have to come, or what you’re going to do next, but be mindful and present in the moment on how your body feels and what’s going on around you. Take deep breaths and some time to truly think about what you’re doing. Do you run because it makes you feel strong and powerful? Or do you run because it just feels good to know you are exercising? Don’t judge it whatever your intention may be. 
Accept it for what it is, embrace it and own it because it’s your thing and makes you feel good.
As I ran through the beautiful city of San Francisco, I focused not on how many miles left I had to go, or the sore feeling that was going to cause me discomfort the next day. Instead, I focused on the smells of the rain from the night before, the green that makes the Bay Area different than L.A., the way the Golden Gate Bridge looks in the blue sky and how that affected me physically as I ran. 
So what is the take away here? While it’s important to prep physically — to time your runs correctly, to make sure you are eating healthy, getting enough sleep, drinking enough water, stretching your body — also remind yourself that you are enough, that you can do this and you are so capable of being the greatest version of your running self.
Maintaining a runner’s mindset can help you get through the most strenuous of physical tests and mentally tough situations that life throws your way.

In response to recent mass shootings on college campuses in Oregon and Tennessee, USC students and faculty met Wednesday night for a panel discussion on gun violence and campus safety. “Trending Topics: Gun Control,” part of a monthly current events discussion series, was presented by the USC Speakers Committee, USG External Affairs and the Delta Omicron Zeta fraternity, and featured a panel of speakers that included a gun control activist and a trauma surgeon.
The event was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, who opened by asking what kinds of gun protections existed on campus — and what students could do to reduce gun violence.
Capt. Edgar Palmer, the Administrative Commander for the Department of Public Safety, explained that DPS keeps students safe by taking part in “active shooter” training and working in close partnership with the Los Angeles Police Department. However, Palmer also stressed that safety is equally in the hands of the students, who often put themselves in danger through a lack of awareness. 
“To stay safe, you have to be aware of your surroundings,” Palmer said. “I am amazed when I come on campus and see the world that students seem to be in. If you’re not aware and you’re not looking around, it makes it far easier for you to be a victim.” 
In stressing vigilance, Palmer encouraged students to react to the things that they saw by reporting any suspicious activity through various channels, including the blue light emergency phones on campus and the new LiveSafe app. According to Palmer, students are often afraid of embarrassing themselves or wasting DPS officers’ time; however, students should not let this stop them from reporting what they see. 
“The one thing you don’t report could be the thing that blows into something more significant,” Palmer said. “It’s always better to take a look and have it investigated than to leave it to chance and just hope it turns out not to be bad.” 
According to Dr. Kelly Greco, Psy.D., a staff psychologist at the USC Engemann Student Health Center, this prerogative extends not only to suspicious activity seen around campus, but to friends or family who may be a danger to themselves or to others. Greco stressed that gun violence includes suicide as well as homicide, and that preventing gun deaths includes helping students who may be considering self-harm.
“Whenever someone comes in seeking counseling, we ask them about suicide — but we also rely on other people to give us information,” Greco said. “There’s always discussion, but we’re always needing someone to seek us out if they are concerned.”
Seeking help, according to Greco, involves asking someone directly if they’re considering suicide or homicide, as well as looking at whether someone is impaired through alcohol or drug use and may constitute a danger to themselves or other people. Dr. Damon Clark, a leading trauma surgeon at the Keck School of Medicine, explained that the consequences of holding back are dire for all involved. 
“We [at Keck] have the experience of taking care of a lot of young individuals who are involved in violence,” Clark said. “It’s not like [what] you see on TV. When someone’s injured, it’s very traumatic. Many people forget the impact that it has on not only the person who is injured physically and emotionally, but also on the family and community that surround that person.”
Schnur then directed the conversation to focus on the extremely divisive issue of the nation’s gun control laws, which has split the nation evenly between those who support more restrictions on gun ownership and those who wish to preserve gun rights. Suzanne Verge, President of the Los Angeles chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, discussed the difficulty of passing gun control legislation when organizations such as the National Rifle Association send lobbyists to block Congressional action. 
Verge, who became involved in the fight to increase restrictions on firearms nationwide after a personal family tragedy, described a recent Brady Campaign summit in Washington, D.C., during which she and others involved in the movement listened to the stories of people who had been affected by gun violence. 
“This is the only thing that’s going to make a difference, story by story,” Verge said. “My brother was killed in 1978, and it’s still so hard to hear other people’s stories.”
