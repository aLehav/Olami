This past weekend, No. 9 USC men’s tennis team went up against multiple California schools at home in the David X. Marks Tennis Stadium. The squad played two matches  Friday and one Sunday to round out the weekend. 
In Friday’s games, USC first went up against UC Davis. Even though the Trojans ended up sweeping the Aggies 7-0, they faced some challenges during the matches. 
In the initial doubles rounds, USC went up 1-0 after the pairing of junior Stefan Dostanic and freshman Peter Makk won a close 6-4 match against juniors Mitchell Davis and Andrei Volgin in the number 1 slot. The Aggies responded and tied it up 1-1, after juniors Brett Brinkman and Andras Necz edged out the Trojan duo of graduate student Paul Barretto and freshman Ryan Colby 4-6. 
In a tightly-contested doubles matchup to determine the doubles point, junior Ryder Jackson and his partner freshman Wojtek Marek won in tiebreaker 7-6 (3), against Davis’ freshman duo of Ryan Morgan and Ryan Torres. 
After the thrilling doubles matches, the Trojans went on to easily sweep the Aggies during the singles matchups in straight sets with notable wins from No. 6 ranked Stefan Dostanic, No. 70 ranked Bradley Frye and No. 35 ranked Peter Makk to give USC the 7-0 win. 
The second match of the day against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps ended in a 7-0 final result. 
The Trojans showed strong performances in doubles. The pairing of Colby and Frye dominated the doubles team of junior Ian Freer and freshman Matthew Robinson 6-1. Then, the duo of Barretto and Makk won 6-3 against seniors Ethan Carroll and grade captain Robert Liu to deliver the Trojans the doubles point. 
Once again, USC had sweeps in straight sets during the singles round leading into Sunday’s play against UC Irvine. 
Although the Trojans could not to sweep the Anteaters in doubles play, they still managed a 6-1 win. 
USC’s best doubles team with No. 10 ranked Dostanic and Frye defeated Irvine’s graduate student Riccardo Roberto and sophomore Thomas Smart  6-1. 
Barretto and Makk gave the Trojans the doubles point again winning 6-1 against juniors Ali Amiri and Matthew Sah. The Trojans cruised through singles again, winning straight sets, except for the final matchup where Amiri ousted Barretto in a tiebreaker, 6-4, 2-6, 1-0 (10-7). 
Head Coach Brett Masi praised the team’s performance during the Irvine matchup, especially during doubles. 
“We are really kinda preaching about just being a little more assertive and aggressive in our mindset,” said Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We were taking balls at the net, trying to be aggressive with our serves and first returns.”
The weekend sweep leads into the ITA Kickoff tournament next weekend with USC playing Pepperdine, Denver and Harvard.
Masi highlighted the mindset of the team going into the tournament after this past weekend’s victories.
“Just think we are going to be a little more at ease,” Masi said. “I think the guys know that level is going to be better, like I said, but none of these teams were slouches by any means.” 
The Trojans will play their first match against Harvard Saturday where the winner will have a spot in the championship game Sunday.

It had been a tough start for No. 15 USC in its first home game with fans in attendance since December. 
Midway through the first half, the Trojans had the same number of points as turnovers — 8 — while shooting just over 30% from the field. It seemed like a lid was left on the rim with USC missing 8 consecutive shots and going scoreless across six minutes. 
With every missed shot, nervous sighs echoed through the arena. The Galen Center fans sat quiet, like an elementary student thrown into timeout while his friends played on the field. 
Then, it happened. 
A 3-pointer by freshman guard Reese Dixon-Waters, a catch and shoot three from junior forward Isaiah Mobley, another three from Dixon-Waters and a pull-up shot by Mobley from beyond the arc detonated a hushed crowd. 
Down 12 points with 6:19 left in the first half, USC went on a 21-2 run to close the period, snatching any Arizona State momentum. 
By the end of the night, Galen Center was rocking again as the Trojans cruised to a dominant 78-56 victory against the Sun Devils Monday. All 12 scholarship players saw action. 
Mere minutes after the final buzzer sounded, remaining fans, media members and players were forced to evacuate Galen Center due to a bomb threat. The Department of Public Safety and the Los Angeles Police Department found no credible threats, DPS interim Chief David Carlisle confirmed to the Daily Trojan. 
USC has now won its last four meetings against Arizona State. The Trojans are also 15-0 on the season while holding their opponents to under 40% shooting. Arizona State shot 34% from the field.
After 23 points against Utah last Saturday, senior guard Drew Peterson again led USC with 16 points on an efficient 6-for-8 shooting. Mobley, junior forward Max Agbonkpolo and redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin added 12 points each.
The Sun Devils hung around early in the second half behind a trifecta of 3-pointers from sophomore guard DJ Horne. Arizona State’s leading scorer on the season had 9 of its first 11 points and finished with 14 points in the game. 
Horne’s hot shooting cut USC’s lead down to 6 with 15:25 left in the game. The Trojans responded with a 10-2 run across five minutes to extend their lead to 14 and never looked back. 
The Sun Devils began the game in a solid rhythm on offense, hitting 3 of their first 4 shots to take the lead early. USC struggled to put the ball in the basket as Arizona State emerged in a comfortable position. 
Even with the offensive problems, the Trojans’ defensive activity kept the deficit manageable before going on a game swinging run as the half closed. Prior to Monday, USC held opponents to 37% shooting from the field — sixth-best in the nation.
It showed as the game progressed with Arizona State scoring just 7 points in the final 10 minutes of the first half. The Sun Devils went scoreless for nearly five minutes too while the Trojans exploded on a run.  
USC will look to avenge their early season loss against Stanford on Thursday at Galen Center.

No. 16 USC is off to a 16-2 start after sweeping the Rocky Mountain road trip for just the second time since Utah and Colorado joined the Pac-12 in 2011. 
Previously ranked as high as No. 5 in the AP Poll, USC will face some top teams in the Conference of Champions. Here are five of the most important games left for the Trojans as February approaches. 
Away versus Oregon State on Feb. 24
The Beavers made a surprising run at the end of last season, winning the Pac-12 tournament and making it to the Elite Eight before losing to No. 2 Houston. Oregon State lost to USC 81-71 at Galen Center Jan. 13, but junior guard Jarod Lucas made a statement against the Trojans. 
The 6-foot-4 sharpshooter hurt the USC frontcourt, notching 27 points on 60% shooting from beyond the arc and exposing the Trojans’ lack of defense against deep threat guards. 
The Beavers currently sit at 3-14, last in the Pac-12. Dropping a game against them late in the season would hurt momentum going into March. 
Home versus Stanford on Jan. 27
The Trojans’ first loss of the season came on the road against the Cardinal two weeks ago, ending a 13-game winning streak to start the season. 
Stanford freshman forward Harrison Ingram caught fire in the game, scoring 21 points en route to a 75-69 win. Ingram showed the Trojans a player they haven’t really seen — a long 6-foot-78 freshman who can extend the floor with a 3-point shot or put the ball on the floor with a drive to the basket. 
Avenging this loss would look good on USC’s resume once seeding is figured out for March Madness. Two losses against a team in the middle of Pac-12 rankings will stick out like a sore thumb to the selection committee. 
The Trojans must defeat teams such as Stanford if they hope to make a run in March.
Away versus Oregon on Feb. 26
Speaking of opponents who beat USC, Oregon gave the Trojans their second loss in three games when they came to Galen Center Jan. 15. 
Even though Oregon had a slow start to the season — a 6-6 record after the first 12 games — the Ducks have caught fire, rattling off five wins in a row, including back-to-back victories over UCLA and USC on the road. 
Senior guard Will Richardson exposed the Trojans’ lack of defenders at the guard position when he exploded for 28 points on 9-for-15 shooting. Junior guard De’Vion Harmon also rattled off 16 points on 6-for-11 shooting. Oregon as a team shot 47.6% from the 3-point line too.
The Ducks have been a staple of Pac-12 basketball in recent years, taking consecutive regular season conference championships. A road game in late February could decide the Pac-12 championship, but it’s also a huge win for a Trojans side that struggled in the first meeting. 
Away versus No. 9 UCLA on March 5
Any matchup against UCLA would normally be the most important in a story such as this., but this isn’t the most difficult matchup.
The Bruins had an impressive win against Villanova at home early in the season and lost to Gonzaga in November. It’s been a consistent season for UCLA and the Bruins are once again in deep.
Four players are averaging double digit points, including standout junior guard Johnny Juzang with a team high 18 per game. Senior guard Jules Bernard has taken a leap too, averaging 13 points per game, while junior guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. continues to be UCLA’s “do everything” man.
Redshirt junior Tyger Campbell has had major improvements from beyond the arc — he’s shooting 43.5% after 25% his sophomore season. This can pose problems to USC’s defense, and in the last game of the season, the Trojans can’t afford to let this game slip.
Away versus No. 3 Arizona on Feb. 5
The Wildcats have been the best team in the Pac-12 this season, with wins over Michigan and Illinois but a close loss to Tennessee on the road. Arizona is the biggest test USC will face once this matchup comes around. 
Sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin leads the Wildcats with nearly 18 points per game on 50% shooting from the field. The 6-foot-6 guard is explosive, dropping 30 on the road against the Fighting Illini and 28 in a 4- point loss on the road against the Volunteers. 
Mathurin’s pairing with sophomore forward Azuolas Tubelis is a dangerous offensive one. Junior forward Isaiah Mobley will likely get the matchup against the 6-foot-11 lefty, but Tubelis is an unorthodox player with great ball handling skills for his size.  
Seeing that this is the only matchup against Arizona this season, a loss will hurt a potential Pac-12 regular season title and March Madness seeding.

No. 12 men’s volleyball wrapped up the Pac-12/Big Ten Challenge tournament breaking even with a big win against No. 3 Penn State and their first loss of the season against No. 11 Ohio State. 
USC entered the tournament undefeated, sweeping Princeton and Erskine at Galen Center before making their way to Westwood to face Penn Friday.  After their win against Erskine, the Trojans officially had their best start since 2015. 
USC handed the Nittany Lions their first loss of the season, winning in four sets (25-22, 25-23, 23-25, 25-16). The Trojans dominated the stat sheet with 7 team blocks to Penn’s 4 and 57 kills to Penn’s 47. 
Redshirt sophomore outside hitter Simon Gallas led the team with 30 kills and 31 points, and graduate outside hitter Sam Kobrine added 11 kills and 13.5 points. Gallas continued his hot start to the season, now leading the team with 92 total kills in just 6 games.
Against the Buckeyes, USC won one out of four sets (24-26, 25-16, 18-25, 21-25). Ohio State entered the match taking their first loss of the season against No. 2 UCLA Friday. 
Both squads hit at a low rate — the Buckeyes had a 20% rate, while the Trojans had 18%, substantially below their 40% and 56% in their previous two games. 
After losing the first set by 2 points, USC made a statement win in the second set, pulling away to a 5-2 lead after a 3-point scoring run. A 5-point scoring run later in the set put the Trojans up 20-12 and helped to equalize the scoreboard 1-1. 
Ohio State would turn the tables in the third set, going on multiple scoring runs to close out with a 7 point lead entering the fourth set.
The Buckeyes pulled away early in what would be the final set, leading 5-1 before the Trojans would rally to tie up the game 7-7 a few plays later. The two teams would continue to trade scoring runs throughout the set, but USC would never see the lead as the Buckeyes eventually ran away with it. 
Big blocks by Ohio State sophomore outside hitter Jacob Pasteur and senior outside hitter Martin Lallemand drove the Buckeyes’ momentum in sealing the match.
Contrasting their matchup against Penn, USC accounted for 35 kills to Ohio’s 55 but kept close in terms of hitting percentage — 18.3% to 20.3%. As expected, the Buckeyes dominated the statsheet as well, with players leading in kills, hitting percentage, digs, assists, blocks and points.
For the Trojans, Gallas and senior outside hitter Brandon Browning both churned out 13 points, with 11 and 12 kills, respectively. Junior middle blocker Lucas Frassrand led in hitting percentage at 40% with 4 kills and 6 points in the match. 
USC will take on UC Irvine in back-to-back games Wednesday and Friday at home and away.

Residential Education Student Affairs officials threatened punishment including probation and firing against resident assistants if they failed to report to shifts during the resident assistant strike, according to images posted on the @uscraorganizingcommittee Instagram and emails obtained by the Daily Trojan.
Disciplinary action against RAs typically takes the form of a three-strike policy, where missing a shift without calling in at least 48 hours prior amounts to a single strike, according to emails sent to RAs who called in to strike. Despite this policy, RA team leaders received information the night of the strike that striking for that night alone could lead to termination. 
“[The document] basically also shared that if we went to the media, basically, as an RA of USC, and speaking directly from that role, that that can also be counted as a strike against us,” a McCarthy RA who requested anonymity due to the threat of disciplinary action said. “They had the possibility not only to not rehire us but to terminate our position.” 
The McCarthy team decided not to uniformly strike due to fear of termination stemming from the threats, leaving RAs to decide whether or not to strike individually.
“I was still very worried about ResEd retaliating against us,” the RA said. “I didn’t know if it was fair for [them] to get punished out of the entire team.”
According to the RA, the threats by ResEd deepened the rift between those who are affected by the financial aid changes and those who are not, and are therefore more hesitant to strike.
“They weren’t so much encouraging us to work together,” they said. “They basically destroyed all that by how they responded to the strike.”
According to the RAs’ November petition and prior interviews with the Daily Trojan, when RAs received their financial aid packages before the fall semester, some realized it was smaller than it had been in the past, causing them to lose money while working long hours. Financial Aid registered RAs’ housing as free and removed it from the cost of attendance, resulting in a lower amount of gift aid despite no changes in some RAs’ financial situations. The petition demanded RAs are paid a stipend equivalent to room and board instead of deducting housing costs, removing the need to alter financial aid. 
The USC RA Organizing Committee announced plans late November for an indefinite strike to start Dec. 3, demanding the financial aid office “fix [their] financial aid.”
A second McCarthy RA said they were warned about these alterations by other low-income students before they took on the job.
“It might just mess up your financial aid,” the second RA said. “You can just get the same amount of financial aid and work an actual job that will pay you.”
When the second RA began to raise gift aid concerns with residence coordinator Sally Belpoornia and senior director of ResEd Grant Burlew, they were told the role was a “personal decision” rather than a job, emphasizing a passion for their work rather than compensation. This definition is at odds with the long hours and effort the role requires, the second RA said.
“It’s like customer service. You need patience for this, it’s not something that you do for fun,” the second RA said. “The fact that it’s framed that way is a particular aspect of the RA position.”
The Financial Aid Office and ResEd held a town hall in the week following the strike, where representatives of both offices listened to RAs’ concerns and put them in contact with financial aid officials. The end result was frustrating, the second RA said.
“From the town hall, I can see that there wasn’t a lot of communication between them,” they said. “They didn’t know that there’s a difference between the apartment RAs and the freshman RAs because the difference is our meal plans.”
Students living in the typical USC dorm require a $6,630 meal plan as part of their residence, whereas those living in USC apartments have a smaller $4,520 meal plan. 
Financial Aid also awarded an additional one-time payment of $500 to RAs for “recognition for the increased stress in the overall student body due to COVID-19,” according to a December email from interim Vice President of Student Affairs Monique Allard to RAs obtained by the Daily Trojan. The Financial Aid Office emailed RAs that the payments will be disbursed some time in Spring 2022. Addressing some of the grievances raised at the town hall, the email also announced a cost of attendance update adjustment for RAs to reflect the differences in meal plans between those living in dorms and apartments.
“They didn’t necessarily intend for it to be hush money, but it definitely came across that way,” a third McCarthy RA said. “They felt like everyone was pissed off at them.”
The email also said that USC will change its policy regarding the “minimum student contribution” component — equivalent to the average income of a full time student — in the financial aid package for RAs, which will now cover the contribution in addition to a gift aid amount based on need. This can act as compensation for RAs with demonstrated need, rather than just taking out housing costs.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, ResEd wrote that the University is committed to “examine” the RA role at USC and that the RA Advisory Board will meet to “help with this process.” They also announced a survey “sent out by Campus Wellbeing that will look at RA well-being.”
The third RA said they were “saddened” because several people decided not to reapply for the role after December, citing the positive experience they personally had. 
“Despite all this communication issues, it’s still been really, definitely worth it for me,” they said. “Besides the compensation part of it, being able to connect with my residents and actually help people is the reason I did it.”

When the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, Dr. Francisco Perez-Arce and other contributors began collecting data to determine the relationship between an individual’s vaccination status and their mental health. The study, which published Sept. 8 in scientific journal PLOS One, found that among 8,003 surveyed adults across the country, vaccinated adults between December 2020 and March 2021 experienced decreased mental distress levels following their first dose. 
Perez-Arce, an economist at the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, contributed to the project by providing “formal analysis and helping with the [study’s] methodology.” The study sought to discover how people across the United States felt during a pandemic where mental health distress levels rose to a “peak” in April 2020.
“The main goal is to contribute to our understanding of the trajectories of mental health throughout the pandemic,” Perez-Arce said. “There’s a lot of research on this, and there’s a lot of worry about what has happened to [the] mental health of the entire population and different groups in the population.” 
The study recognized that mental distress became a major focus in a pandemic that also affected other aspects of people’s lives, such as employment and physical health. To obtain data for the study, the contributors processed results from the Understanding America Study, a survey formed by a panel of households taken by approximately 9,500 respondents. 
Arie Kapteyn, executive director of CESR and another contributor to the study, said the participants of the survey were asked questions every two weeks about the coronavirus pandemic since March 2020. Following vaccine availability, the survey asked participants whether or not they received the vaccine. 
“It turns out that we are the only ones who have collected continuous data about the effects of the pandemic on American households in the country,” Kapteyn said. “The result is that hundreds and hundreds of research groups around the world are using our data. 
Before receiving the results, Perez-Arce said he believed that those who chose to receive a vaccination would experience an improvement in their mental health. However, Perez-Arce said that he remained skeptical of whether receiving a vaccination caused improvement in mental health, as indirect effects caused by factors like knowing that others would be vaccinated could impact one’s well-being. 
“The data we’re using for this study is from relatively earlier stages of the vaccination campaign, so I wasn’t eligible at that time to get vaccinated, but I was still feeling better about the whole situation because I knew that other people close to me were getting vaccinated,” he said.
The contributors noted that it was difficult to make sure that they obtained sufficient data and information at the start of the pandemic. 
“It was very useful that we started right away in March because now we can see how things look and compare to how they looked right before or right as the pandemic was starting,” Perez-Arce said. “You can see things like what the drop in mental health was from March to April of 2020, which many studies cannot do, because they just start collecting data later on.”
The study’s conclusion found that receiving the first dose of the vaccine “resulted in significant improvements in mental health, beyond improvements already achieved since mental distress peaked in the spring of 2020.” However, the study also noted potential limitations, including the possibility of individuals becoming less depressed after knowing others received the vaccine. 
Despite the possible limitations, Perez-Arce recognizes the study used what was available at the time that allowed the team to do the research and gather information. He clarified that the study, while it does not capture the overall effect of vaccinations, is honest about its findings and what they mean and do not mean.
“There’s nothing I can think of that I would do differently given the constraints that we have … so hopefully other studies will look at later effects,” he said.
Neeraj Sood, a professor of health policy at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, and Virat Agrawal, a doctoral candidate studying public policy and management, both cited the CESR’s research for their own paper.
“It is routine practice in research to cite all related papers to the paper you’re working on,” Sood said. “That’s the reason why we cited the CESR paper. The Understanding America Study, which is the CESR study, has been an important study in terms of tracking the pandemic and its consequences.”
Agrawal also said that researchers tend to extend upon the works of other scholars. What made Agrawal’s and Sood’s paper different from the CESR research article, for instance, was that their paper sought to find the spillover effects of the mental health of communities that witnessed others being vaccinated. 
“We try to build up on that existing work by finding out, ‘What are the other social benefits, like when my friends, families and people in my neighborhood are vaccinated and are not vaccinated?’” Agrawal said.
Regarding future studies, Perez-Arce would like to see how they would investigate any externalities that may impact people’s mental health. He is also interested in potentially seeing the effect vaccinations for children and adolescents have on parents’ mental health.
“That’ll require a slightly different research strategy, but it would be very interesting to see how mental health effects such as vaccination go beyond defending yourself,” he said.

It isn’t every day that you see a student from your alma mater, especially when a six-year gap separates your cohorts, but for Bella Hicks, it’s been an everyday occurrence for the last few months.
In the run up to Tony Spinosa and James Bearhart’s new musical “Singing Revolution,” Hicks has collaborated with some of the greatest talents in theatre, including School of Dramatic Arts student Chloe Willey as assistant stage manager.
Their shared Trojan training is just one of the unlikely threads to have woven together to produce the story of “Singing Revolution.” Based on the revolution of the same name, the musical features a Euro-pop soundtrack, an enchanting love story and generations of intricate plot, all set against the peaceful protest movement that achieved independence for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1991.
To play Sofia Solokov, the female lead, Spinosa and his collaborators considered choosing a strong singer and actress, capable of portraying the multidimensional character and captivating audiences. They chose Hicks, who graduated from SDA in 2016, who, years earlier, did not have musical theatre in mind.
“I actually went up to my mom when I was seven, and I said ‘I want to be a pop star,’” Hicks said. “And she’s like, ‘Okay, write a song.’ So I wrote my first song when I was seven. It was terrible. I will not be singing any of that for you.”
Despite her early passion for music, Hicks was unsure about pursuing the arts at the collegiate level and eagerly looked to explore outside her hometown of Los Angeles. Also wishing to pursue a financially stable career, Hicks studied geology at the University of Michigan her freshman year.
“I was miserable; I was cold; I was depressed,” Hicks said. “I was like, ‘This is not where my heart is. I had to be doing what I loved,’ and it’s always been music for me. It’s always been performing.”
Hicks transferred to USC soon after, taking music classes while majoring in theatre because of USC’s absent musical theatre program at the time. Though she expected competition and exclusivity, she found dozens of collaborators and friends to help her pursue her dreams.
“It was that collaboration that made the whole USC experience for me,” Hicks said. “It’s always about the team, which I think is something I’ve carried through professionally, especially with [the pandemic] situation that we’re going through now.”
That bond has grown especially invaluable during the coronavirus pandemic, when the crew relies on each other to stay safe and continue pursuing their art.
“It’s hard enough putting on a musical, a new musical, and to layer on the pandemic. The coronavirus on top of it has been a challenge,” Spinosa said. “I won’t lie, it has been a challenge.
Amid panic and unease, Hicks took the opportunity to explore a space where she could feel in control — her art. To sustain her creativity, Hicks has been working on an album, set to release in the next few weeks.
“It’s interesting because when all of your opportunities go [away], what do you do? What do you turn to?’” Hicks said. “It’s cool, creating my own content, I did something I would probably never get to do.”
Although the return of live performance has gratified Hicks, her soul wouldn’t just be fed by a return to performance but also the opportunity to sing the style of music she had come to love most.
“I grew up singing pop music, R&B and soul,” Hicks said. “So, for me, hearing this music in a musical theater context, it’s definitely the way the tradition is heading … [It] was so satisfying to me, because our music director was like, ‘You can riff, you can improvise, you can have fun with it,’ and I was like a kid in a candy store.”
Hicks, Spinosa said, is the perfect actress to star in the modernized musical he envisioned. Her ability to work with directors and hone her character is remarkable but so too is the natural love she shows for the music.
“She brings so much soul to the music in the show,” Spinosa said. “She’s a brilliant musician. I know that she writes music as well, and she brings all of her talents to the table in this production.”
Spinosa wasn’t the only showrunner to appreciate working with Hicks. Willey, a senior majoring in stage management at SDA, lauded Hicks’ skills and kindness.
“Bella is ridiculously talented,” Willey said. “She’s incredibly thoughtful about what everyone else has going on. It’s amazing to collaborate with her even just on a quick change.”
The pandemic has been incredibly difficult for performing artists, Hicks’ experience included. However, through struggles and delays and with an optimistic outlook, she says working with the crew of “Singing Revolution” has made her a better actor.
“It’s definitely [been] an intense journey. I’ve grown as an actor because I definitely see myself as a singer first,” Hicks said. “It’s been a challenge and also really, really fun to push myself and do all of this work.”
The show is set to premiere Jan. 29 and run through Feb. 20 at the Broadwater Theatre in L.A.

USC began construction of USC Village in 2014 amid tensions between local South Central residents and students who looked to secure housing. USC Village is the University’s, as well as one of South Central’s largest development, at $650 million. Its new dorms and the $20 million that USC provided to an affordable housing fund run by the city of Los Angeles pointed toward a future where South Central residents would no longer have to compete with students for housing. 
That was in 2014. As a local resident myself, USC’s efforts were not nearly enough to stop gentrification in my neighborhood. 
Although the University hasn’t constructed any significant structures since the remodeling of USC Village, its choice to expand the student population each year has led to the school playing an indirect role in the gentrification of South Central, in addition to their more direct approaches. 
USC’s total undergraduate and graduate student population for the 2011-2012 school year was 38,010. As of last year, that total increased to 46,107. The last time the school expanded its housing was in 2017, when construction of the remodeled USC Village, with new stores, restaurants and dorms, ended. Increases in the student population, without an equal or significant increase in available University housing, has led to gentrification ravaging the neighborhood even quicker. 
USC housing can only accommodate about 9,000 students in their dorms, which means more than 35,000 students must look for housing outside of the school. Additionally, only freshmen and sophomores are guaranteed a place to stay within the housing system. Developers and landlords know students are willing and capable to pay more for less space, so they are incentivized to cater to the student population, rather than the South Central families who have lived here for years. 
According to a 2017 study from the Equality of Opportunity Project, the median family income of a USC student is $161,400. According to the 2017 census, the median income in the University’s 90007 zip code was $23,070. It is clear that the average USC student has more buying power than most families in the area. Is it then fair to pit us against one another? 
When I was a kid, none of the houses on my street leased to students. Now, whenever I see a house remodeled or a new apartment being built, it is almost always adorned with a sign that read, “Now leasing to students.” My neighbors and their families were forced to relocate as new apartment buildings were constructed for USC students. Soon enough, people outside of my community moved in. First Choice Housing, who leases their properties to USC students, charges almost triple my rent price for houses that are about the same size. They aren’t the only ones who do this. Tripalink and other entities, such as Tuscany and Icon Plaza Apartments, also charge similar rent prices. The South Central community can’t compete, and they shouldn’t have to. 
When the University simultaneously funds community programs but also increases its student population year by year thus making housing in the community less attainable, what’s its goal? Whenever USC voice their commitment to South Central, its words fall flat on the ears of the community because we have seen the school beautify itself and the neighborhood. But we experience those changes only from the sidelines because those nice things are not meant for South Central. If the school wants to help the community, they must do so holistically and not in ways where they simultaneously harm the community. 
Did the $20 million donation to the city’s housing fund bandage the gaping $650 million wound that USC Village created? Tripalink and others continue to build more apartments on our streets. 
USC can address this issue by working closer with off-campus housing developers to ensure their developments do not displace local residents and that their rent reflects the income in the neighborhood. They must also accept and incorporate more of South Central residents into the student body. In 2021 the University said that, “almost 200 of USC’s newly enrolled students earned their diplomas from the Los Angeles Unified School District” which incorporates schools within South Central and East Los Angeles. That means that only about 6% of freshmen in the 2021-2022 school year were from local communities. 
USC fails to show any commitment to the South Central community. No matter how many community initiatives the University starts or attempts to diversify the campus demographics every year, USC continues to play one of the biggest roles in the gentrification of South Central. What makes this issue particularly aggravating is that USC has the resources to make the school a part of South Central, instead of an obstruction to the community. 
The question remains: Considering USC’s extensive record as a gentrifier, will it ever do more than make empty promises to enact change?

Students at the University of Oklahoma must be disappointed; Lincoln Riley, their football head coach, stepped down to take the position at USC. Having led the Sooners to four straight Big 12 victories and an overall record of 55-10, Riley had the highest winning percentage as Oklahoma’s head coach.
With a disastrous season fresh under their belt, USC football needs Riley to endeavor on winning ways.
However, there’s a catch.
According to Los Angeles Times, USC offered Riley a speculated $110 million deal. Additionally, the University is currently handling his $4.5 million buyout and must pay former Head Coach Clay Helton more than $10 million due to the remaining two years on his contract. Along with unlimited access to a private jet and other benefits, Riley will be the highest-paid coach in college football history. 
This article is not meant to criticize Riley, but rather the University’s spending habits. While Riley reaps all the benefits from USC funding, the other members of the Trojan community struggle with minimal financial support from the University. With the average debt for undergraduate Trojans approximating at $20,000 and students with private loans having $48,000 in personal loan debt upon graduation, perhaps USC should invest their money in other sectors. With USC’s tuition nearing $20,000 more than the national average of $41,000, the student body is left questioning where exactly all the money goes. 
For the 2020-21 academic year, the school raised its tuition by 3.5%, approximating to $59,260. The University also took a revenue drop of $597 million for the fiscal year, causing pay cuts for faculty, staff and administrators. In addition, USC froze hiring and merit increases for employees, overall decreasing philanthropy for the Trojan Family. 
With all that money going into Riley’s contract, one might believe at least some of it should go back to either the students or the USC workforce. In 2020, institutional scholarships, endowed scholarships and external financial aid totaled $637,975. In 2021, the total minimally increased to $671,498. According to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, endowment for departmental programs and activities decreased to $179,006 in 2021 from $191,060 in 2020. As covered by Annenberg Media, the decrease in salaries and endowment followed the economic hit created by the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, academic scholarship and program funding is nominal compared to Riley’s $110 million deal. 
Outside of the students and staff, educational and social initiative programs need a share of the wealth. As recently covered by the Daily Trojan, the USC Homelessness Initiative faced many challenges due to a lack of funding. The program, which emphasized easing the housing crisis in Los Angeles, could easily restart with a small percentage of Riley’s contracts. The former director of the USC Homelessness Initiative, Brenda Wiewel, said that the decrease in their budget each year was one of the primary reasons resulting in their shutdown. Other programs, like the Trojan Food Pantry, closed due to understaffing issues. Student Basic Needs further acknowledged that only two full-time employees worked there before Trojan Food Pantry shut down. Before its closure, the pantry provided food, non-perishable objects and other necessities, which dealt a significant blow to students who struggled financially and relied on the pantry’s resources. 
USC cannot pay individuals such as Riley these ludicrous salaries. Athletes generate revenue through ticket sales and merchandise, but the players themselves are only compensated by the University through athletic scholarships. Recently, the National Collegiate Athletic Association permitted a policy allowing student-athletes in all three divisions to receive remuneration for the use of their name, image and likeness. This has allowed such athletes to receive money from sponsors and endorsements, a big step in the United States college sports industry which generates roughly $18.9 billion in 2019.
However, most athletes don’t receive health coverage for non-sports-related injuries, and zero obtain long-term coverage for future health problems that result from playing on the field or court. On the other hand, coaches and athletic directors receive retirement plan benefits, vacation pay and University-provided life and disability insurance.
The least USC could do is appropriately endow Trojan athletes with health coverage and benefits.
Riley’s multimillion-dollar contract shows the University problematic spending its money at the expense of those who need it. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, academic and student-based programs are floundering, school faculty members see smaller paychecks, students receive less financial aid and student athletes are still receiving minimal compensation. Nevertheless, Riley’s deal shows that USC does have enough money to put into other sectors if they choose to. Perhaps Riley can turn the Trojans into a powerhouse football team, but it should not be at the expense of the entire Trojan family.

Combining jazz, rock and soul influences, Sammy Rae & The Friends create a contemporary sound for audiences who enjoy music from a variety of genres, and shared it with a sold-out crowd at the Teragram Ballroom. Packed with listeners eager to join the group for their first ever round of performances on the West Coast, the space overflowed with unmatched, familial energy Friday night. 
As of this performance, the group of “Friends” consists of C-Bass Chiriboga (drums), James Quinlan (bass), Will Leet (guitar/keys), Max Zooi (tenor saxophone/synths), Debbie Tjong (vocals), and Kellon Anderson (alto saxophone), who, when combined, create an unforgettable rhythm between them. 
For the group, their “Follow Me Like The Moon” tour displayed the continued effort by musicians around the country to sustain live performances and music making throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
“It is essential in those periods where everything feels out of your control that you dig and look for the lesson, because there’s always one in there, and figure out how to move through those periods with grace and gratitude,” said lead vocalist Sammy Rae during the concert. 
The performance was full of unique features. When Rae made comments in between songs, she sang them rather than speaking. Throughout the show, Rae gave the microphone to individuals in the audience and let spectators borrow hats and other props. The Teragram Ballroom, about 10 minutes from USC by car, is one of the most coveted intimate venues for rock and indie artists, and was perfect for Sammy Rae & the Friends’ collaborative and inviting performance. The relatively small venue allowed Rae to centralize audience participation and engagement in a completely transformational way.
Their unique approach is part of the reason their fans are so excited to share their work with others. Addy Lillard and Ella Lavian attended the performance after both hearing about the group through activities at USC. 
“I really got to [hear them] when the a cappella group I’m in covered one of their songs,” Lillard,  a freshman majoring in theatre, said. “So we sang ‘The Feeling,’ and from there, ‘Jackie Onassis’ — loved that song — and then into the rest of their discography.”
While their music beckons sounds from the past, Sammy Rae & The Friends also focus on the more contemporary themes of queerness and sexuality, in songs such as “Jackie Onassis,” a queer female awakening centered on former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. For Lavian, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, “Jackie Onasis” was the accompanying track for a dance performance she had seen on campus and introduced her to the group.
“It was probably the most beautiful dance I’ve ever seen in my life,” Lavian said. “I added that onto my playlist and played it while I was getting ready in the morning for a month straight.”
The group distinguished themselves by creating a sense of familiarity with the audience, continuously smiling and asking the audience to “be their friends” several times throughout the night. Lillard also explained how Sammy Rae’s precise vocal control sounds “almost like an instrument” and that she has “never heard anyone sing like that” before.
The group is no stranger to that sort of praise. They commented during the show that they were ecstatic with the high amount of streams they received for their latest track, “Follow Me Like The Moon.” The band also announced that they were just named one of NPR’s Slingshot’s 2022 Artists to Watch.
Sammy Rae & The Friends began their “Follow Me Like The Moon” Tour on Jan. 16 at the City National Grove of Anaheim and will continue their West Coast leg until the end of January.
Correction: This article was updated to include the name of a band member, Debbie Tjong, and remove the names of two former band members, Myra Moon and Kaya Kulu, who did not play with the group at Teregram.

It’s no surprise that TikTokers have taken the world by storm in the past two years. Originally deemed cringy and embarrassing, the collective boredom and need for a creative outlet over the past two years have meant a boom in the app’s usage. As a result, it launched many content creators into fame. The platform’s growth meant an inevitable bleed into other industries, evident by the new Netflix show “Hype House” and Addison Rae and Dixie D’Amelio’s attendance at the 2021 Met Gala.
Stars crossing into other industries, especially into fashion, isn’t a new concept either; Jeff Goldblum and Asa Butterfield just walked for Prada, Madonna for Jean Paul Gaultier, Jennifer Lopez for Versace, Lady Gaga for Mugler, and, while ironic as their Zoolander characters, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson strutted down Valentino’s runway. 
The flip side of fashion blending into film and entertainment is just as frequent, with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Abbey Lee Kershaw starring in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” as well as Cara Delevingne in “Paper Towns.”
Unsurprisingly, one notable TikToker just landed a huge campaign, and no, it’s not Dixie D’Amelio for Valentino, and as much as I would love to gush about Clara Perlmutter — aka TinyJewishGirl — and her fabulous new Paper Magazine spread, it’s not her either.
We’re here to discuss Francis Bourgeois — real name Luke Nicholson — and his Gucci x North Face campaign. 
Bourgeois’s claim to fame on TikTok is his love of trains, dedicating his entire account to spotting, riding and celebrating trains as he gushes about each model he encounters. He recently posted two TikToks with Joe Jonas, even letting Jonas don his “GoPro duties” in one of the train spotting videos of the day. You might have seen Bourgeois pop up as a joke with some of the train names and his serious discussion about them, but he thrives on social media, his TikTok having 2.2 million followers and his Instagram 1.3 million. 
Despite the silly angle the GoPro gives Bourgeois’ face in some videos, I’m not surprised he landed a massive campaign. He has the obvious features of a model — sharp features, relaxed hair, tall, slim build — but his personality is to die for. 
He truly is a child at heart and was wise to take his niche content to TikTok, the land of niche content. While he faced some backlash after people discovered his true identity — people fearing that Bourgeois was a completely made-up persona while he kept his f-boy tendencies in real life, as seen through his old photos that were unlike his current flowy and bright personality. Addressing the backlash, Bourgeois explained in a video that before the pandemic, he traded up his love for trains for a gym membership and new clothes to fit in. However, with the lockdown in England, he grew out his hair and decided to take the quarantine period to return to his passion of train spotting. 
In his new one minute 15-second Gucci x North Face collection video campaign, presented by High Snobiety, you can easily spot Bourgeois in his train conductor’s outfit, making announcements, checking tickets, shoving fuel and having a grand old time inside the train. While not the main star of the campaign, Bourgeois had a lot of screen time and his presence warmed my heart.
While I am obviously excited about some collection pieces — personally, not big on fanny packs or major logo usage — Bourgeois’s cameo in the campaign gives us a gentle reminder that we don’t need to have everything figured out. Prepandemic, there has always been so much pressure to figure things out by the time we get to college, as if our 18-year-old selves in May versus our 18-year-old selves in August are light years apart in maturity and adultness. 
But, as Bourgeois has shown us, it’s okay to revert back to older dreams and passions, and, even if we feel lost now, we’ll find our way to what we are meant to be and do — just as Bourgeois did with trains after a period of feeling lost and confused. 
We can still be children and pursue our passions, and, especially now, we can make anything a career. So, whether it is statistics or train spotting, take time for yourself and nurture what your heart is attracted to. 
And, maybe one day, you’ll end up in a Gucci campaign.
