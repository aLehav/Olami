The biggest challenge yet for the USC women’s tennis team starts Friday as they take on two Pac-10 foes in non-league matches today and Saturday at Marks Stadium.
USC’s matches this weekend do not count toward the Pac-10 standings but will play an important role when it comes to postseason seeding.
First up is today’s match versus No. 3 California (7-1). USC is 31-25 all-time against the Bears after beating them 4-3 in the teams’ only meeting last season at Marks Stadium.
Cal has three players ranked in singles: No. 2 Jana Juricova, No. 20 Marina Cossou and No. 75 Mari Andersson. Two Cal doubles teams are also ranked: No. 13 Andersson paired with Juricova and No. 54 Marina Cossou and Kasia Siwosz.
Saturday brings in the only undefeated Pac-10 team — No. 11 Stanford (7-0), who has posted shutouts in its last three meets.
USC is 18-57 all-time against Stanford after snapping a 50-match losing streak to the Cardinal with USC’s 5-2 win last season at Marks Stadium.
The Cardinal have five players ranked in singles: No. 13 Hilary Barte, No. 24 Mallory Burdette, No. 36 Lindsay Burdette, No. 54 Stacey Tan and No. 70 Carolyn McVeigh. Two Stanford doubles teams are ranked: No. 2 Barte and Lindsay Burdette and No. 37 Tan and Mallory Burdette.
The No. 10 Women of Troy (7-2) boast an undefeated record at home and are hoping to continue their success as Pac-10 champions from last year. This is their first meeting with Pac-10 opponents all season.
“It felt great last year beating both of them,” said junior Maria Sanchez of USC. “We just hope to go into this weekend with the same intensity and repeat that success.”
According to ITA ranking earlier this week, Sanchez (8-1) climbed in the singles rankings, as did USC sophomore Alison Ramos. Sanchez leads her team at No. 3 with Ramos following close behind at No. 19.
Two other teammates for the Women of Troy are ranked among the nation’s top 50. The two freshmen on the team, Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido, are ranked No. 31 and No. 51, respectively.
The No. 31 doubles pair Pulido and Sanchez will team up against the Pac-10 foes as well.
“Playing against tougher schools the past few weeks has really gotten our energy going,” Lao said. “We’re ready to step it up and give it all we’ve got this weekend.”
“All of these big matches coming up are exciting opportunities for us to play in big, competitive matches,” USC coach Richard Gallien said. “The wins last year absolutely give us confidence. But we realize that was last year. Tomorrow is tomorrow.”
Today’s match begins at 1:30 p.m., while Saturday’s meet will start at noon.

A road date against Oregon was all the USC women’s basketball team needed to get back on track offensively.
The Women of Troy (15-11, 9-6) beat Oregon 87-84 at Mac Court for their second consecutive victory.  Sophomore guard Ashley Corral knocked down five 3-pointers and led four other USC players in double figures with 23 points.
Putting points on the board was not a problem for the Women of Troy against a high-octane Oregon squad that entered the game second in the country in scoring.  USC, which was held below 60 points in its last five games, eclipsed the 60-point mark early in the second half.
A series of runs by both teams marked the second half.  USC seized the lead on the opening possession with a 3-pointer by freshman forward Christina Marinacci.
The Women of Troy would stretch the lead to nine before Oregon made it close late.  Neither team led by more than three points in the half.
Clutch free-throw shooting and some key offensive rebounds helped the Women of Troy avenge an early-season loss to the Ducks.  USC trailed 82-80 late in the game when Marinacci rattled in a pair of free throws.  The Women of Troy would not trail the rest of the way.
Corral knocked down four of six free throws in the final minute to preserve the win for USC.  In a reversal of an earlier game this season, the Women of Troy got an extra possession after knocking a missed free throw out of bounds off an Oregon player.  USC lost a game to California on a similar play.
Big performances on the glass by Marinacci and senior guard Hailey Dunham helped USC outrebound Oregon 34-30.
USC trailed 47-46 at the break despite shooting more than 50 percent from the field in the first half.  Three players for USC reached double digits in points in the half.  Sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath paced all scorers with 15 points.  Corral and Dunham added 14 and 10 points, respectively.
Oregon led 18-11 early when USC coach Michael Cooper picked up a technical foul.  His outburst prompted a 17-9 run by the Women of Troy that put them ahead 28-27.
Oregon senior Taylor Lilley — who erupted for 36 points and a school-record nine 3-pointers in the first meeting between the two schools — scored 14 points in the first half and finished with a team-high 22 points.  Backcourt mate Michaela Cocks added 16 points for the Ducks.
Redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos and Marinacci each scored 13 points for USC.  Dunham finished with 12 points and added seven rebounds for the Women of Troy.
USC moved into sole possession of third place in the Pac-10 with the victory. The Women of Troy look to sweep the season series against Oregon State on Saturday.

After starting the season 3-1, the USC baseball team looks to improve its record this weekend in the Dodgertown Classic. The Trojans will host Oklahoma State tonight and Vanderbilt on Saturday at Dedeaux Field then square off against rival No. 23 UCLA at Dodger Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Though USC will be facing three different opponents this weekend, USC coach Chad Kreuter is treating the weekend like a typical three-game series. His goal is to either win two games or get the three-game sweep, he said.
USC sophomore ace Andrew Triggs will be on the mound tonight for the Trojans. He faces Oklahoma State Tyler Lyons in the contest.
Triggs (1-0, 5.14) settled down after giving up three first-inning runs in USC’s first game of the season at Cal Poly last week. He only allowed one more run in the next six innings and racked up seven strikeouts, earning his first victory of the season. Lyons, who went 7-6 last season with a 4.07 ERA, will start the Cowboys’ season opening game.
The Cowboys have yet to play a game this season because of rain in the Midwest, something Kreuter thinks might be able to help the Trojans.
“They’re traditionally a strong program,” he said, “but this being their first contest, hopefully we can take advantage of that.”
USC will send out sophomore starter Chad Smith (0-1, 12.46) on Saturday to battle Vanderbilt’s pitcher Taylor Hill (1-0, 0.00). Smith struggled in his first outing, allowing six earned runs on six hits in four one-third innings, but Kreuter believes, now that Smith has one start under his belt, he’ll learn how to control his energy on the mound and locate his pitches. Smith’s counterpart, Hill, however, is coming off a stellar start, tossing six two-third scoreless innings against Niagara, allowing six hits with two walks and nine strikeouts.
The Commodores are batting .366 as a team with a 1.42 staff ERA. Smith will have to find a way to contain Vanderbilt infielder Jason Esposito, who is batting .529 (9-17) with a home run and seven RBI.
“We don’t have much of a scouting report on them this early in the season, but we’re expecting them to be really good,” said Kreuter of the typical top-20 program.
On Sunday at 2 p.m., USC sends senior Kevin Couture (0-0, 3.86) to the mound at Dodger Stadium to take on crosstown rival UCLA      (3-0). The Bruins will counter with starter Rob Rasmussen (0-0, 9.82) in the non-conference match.
The Bruins are batting .393 as a team with a 2.50 staff ERA. USC pitchers will need to watch out for catcher Steve Rodriguez, who is batting .417 with four home runs and eight RBI in four games so far. Although USC leads the all-time series with UCLA by a 251-116 margin, the Bruins have won nine of the last 12 games against the Trojans.
“It’s a great venue for this rivalry at Dodger Stadium,” Kreuter said. “It’s one of those places that everybody loves and wants to be there. It’s going to be fun.”
Both Friday and Saturday’s games begin at 6 p.m. USC will take on UCLA at 2 p.m. on Sunday.

Before you go ahead and book your tickets for the College World Series at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Neb., let the season play out a little bit more.
It is, after all, only four games old.
But at 3-1, the USC baseball team couldn’t have asked for a better start — other than 4-0, of course.
Really though — three wins in four games, a minimum of six runs in each game and solid starting pitching in the victories is fairly impressive.
It doesn’t get much better than that.
There’s reason to be optimistic at Dedeaux Field, at least after the first four games of the season. Where there were questions, there are some answers. Where there were concerns, there are temporary assuages.
Can the Trojans hit?
That was, and really still is, the main question this team will have to answer. After all, Grant Green, Robert Stock and Hector Rabago are gone.
But through four games, all they’ve been doing is hitting — to the tune of a .312 team average and 31 runs scored.
Sophomore Ricky Oropesa is picking up right where he left off in 2009, batting .313 through the first four games with three extra-base hits and four runs batted in. Additionally, sophomore transfer Matt Foat has five runs batted in to lead the team.
The Trojans should be able to pitch in 2010. The starting staff is expected to be the strong suit of the squad, anchored by a veteran Sunday starter in Kevin Couture and two solid sophomores, Andrew Triggs and Chad Smith.
And after four starts, things are looking good.
Smith had a rough first start (4.1 IP, 6 ER), but the rest of the staff has started off strong. Three starts with an ERA of just over 4.0 — good enough to win those games.
But of course, the disclaimer remains the same: It has been only four games. Take a deep breath. Let’s see what happens as the season moves on.
It won’t be easy to hit .312 as a squad for the rest of the season, and USC is bound to have a couple of bad starts here and there — just like every other baseball team in the country.
And let’s not pretend the Trojans have defeated perennial powerhouses. Taking two of three from Cal Poly and beating Loyola Marymount on a Tuesday isn’t exactly the equivalent of slaying Goliath.
The tests begin in earnest Sunday at Dodger Stadium, when the Trojans take on No. 23 UCLA. It’s a small taste of what’s to come — a brutally difficult Pac-10 schedule.
But so far, so good.
And while it’s far too early to start looking toward Rosenblatt Stadium, that should always be the goal. Especially for a team with USC’s history.
Especially this year.
The Trojans are 12-time national champions, winning more than any other program in history. They’ve been to the College World Series 21 times.
They might as well have renamed Rosenblatt Stadium as the Dedeaux Field of the Midwest.
But this will be its final year  the stadium’s of service. Starting in 2011, the College World Series will be contested in a brand new ballpark in Omaha.
It will truly be the end of a chapter in the history of one of the most storied tournaments in college sports.
Is there a better way to celebrate the end of the Rosenblatt era than with a tribute from its greatest tenant?
The answer to that is undoubtedly no.
USC owes it to college baseball, the city of Omaha and the ghosts of Rosenblatt Stadium to get back there one last time.
Some are counting down the days until the stadium is gone, having written it off as a worn-down relic of the past. Others will rue the day it closes its doors, revering the ballpark as a shrine of greatness.
To USC, it is simply a second home. The Trojans have no choice but to pay one last visit and say goodbye the right way.

The USC track and field team’s indoor season began weeks ago, but its focus remains on the sunny outdoor skies.
Record holder · Senior sprinter Ahmad Rashad holds the USC 100-meter sprint record of 10.10 seconds, which he ran at last year’s NCAAs. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Despite the fact that several members of the team have already competed in several indoor invitationals, USC Director of track and field Ron Allice says the season has yet to begin.
“Our focus is absolutely on the outdoor season,” Allice says. “We won’t put our best combinations forward until later.”
That outdoor season begins Saturday when USC will compete in the Claremont Rossi Relays in Claremont, Calif., and begin its march toward what Allice hopes will be another top-10 season for the Trojans.
“Our goal is always to be in the top 10 programs in the country and finish higher than we did the previous year,” Allice said. “In addition, our expectation is always to win the UCLA dual meet.”
Entering his 16th year at the helm of the Trojans track team, Allice has plenty of reasons to believe his team will accomplish those goals in 2010. The team returns 14 All-Americans and 22 athletes already ranked in USC’s all-time top 10 for a variety of events.
Among those athletes is senior sprinter Ahmad Rashad, who finished second in the 100-meter dash at the NCAA championships with the fourth best time in Trojan history at 10.10 seconds. Sophomore Joey Hughes, who finished second in the 400-meter dash at both the Pac-10 championships and the NCAA West Regionals, joins Rashad at the core of USC’s talented group of sprinters.
On the women’s side, Dalilah Muhammad, who last year took third place in the 400 hurdles at the NCAA championships as a freshman, returns to lead USC’s women sprinters. Muhammad was also part of the 4×400-meter relay team that took sixth at the NCAA championships. That team returns all four members, including seniors Shalina Clarke, Elizabeth Olear and Myra Hasson.
However, sprints shouldn’t be the only strength for the 2010 Trojans. Allice has always prided himself on having a well-rounded team, as opposed to having what he calls “pockets” — a focus on one area of the team while the others get left behind.
“You cannot neglect any aspect of the program,” Allice said. “A lot of other schools have their ‘flag,’ like Washington and Oregon do with their distance runners. We’re going to have everything.”
USC’s field competitors also made splashes at last year’s marquee meets. Senior Manjula Wijesekara finished third in the high jump at the NCAA championships, while seniors Aaron Dan and Colin Campbell each emerged as two of the best discus throwers in the West region last season.
For the women, junior Zsofia Erdelyi, who holds the USC all-time records in the 3,000-meter steeplechase and the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races, leads the distance squad. Junior Kristine Busa leads the women’s field athletes as the team’s best javelin thrower, finishing eighth at the NCAA championships last year and earning All-American status.
With a talented team like the one Allice has, it’s easy to get excited early. But the veteran director says the team understands that the season itself is a marathon, not a sprint.
“Everything is a stepping stone and progression towards the Dual Meet, the NCAA regionals, the NCAA finals and nationals,” Allice said. “We target from the middle of May until June. Everything else is a stepping stone towards being our best at that time in the season.”
Cant wait to see how the track and field team performs this year!

The cold streak continues for the USC men’s basketball team.
Struggles · Senior guard Dwight Lewis only scored eight points against a surprisingly stingy Oregon defense while playing nearly the entire game. Lewis and the Trojans scored just 12 points in the second half on Thursday night at the Galen Center. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
Mired by offensive ineptitude and missed opportunities of late, the Trojans (16-11, 8-7) brought their shooting woes home on Thursday, losing just their fourth game at the Galen Center this season to visiting Oregon 54-44.
“We just couldn’t do the job tonight,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “I thought we were low energy, and we just didn’t come out with any boost at all. We didn’t make shots. And when you have 18 turnovers, it’s hard to win.”
Despite a 32-23 lead at the half, the Trojans were only able to muster 12 points in the second half while shooting just 24 percent from the field. Guard Tajuan Porter scored 16 for the Ducks (13-14, 5-10), but it was USC’s late-game offensive breakdown that proved to be the deciding factor.
“It is frustrating,” O’Neill said. “I’m sure our players are frustrated too. They didn’t line up those wide-open shots to miss them.”
Unlike later in the game, USC showed signs of dominance in the first half; the Trojans jumped out to an early 6-0 lead on two 3-pointers from senior guard Marcus Johnson and maintained control of the ball game for most of the early proceedings. USC led by as many as 12 in the half and entered the break nine points ahead.
But the second half was where the wheels fell off for the Trojans, as they went on scoreless runs of nine and six minutes while the Ducks took the advantage. Guard LeKendric Longmire had 11 points and Porter had eight for Oregon, including a late 3-pointer that sealed the victory, in the second period.
“We really failed to capitalize,” said USC senior guard Mike Gerrity. “We settled for outside shots. [Our] confidence started to lower. It was very frustrating.”
Longmire contributed 13 points and four rebounds in total on the night, and Oregon guard Malcolm Armstead added seven points coming off the bench.
If there is a silver lining to be found, it comes in the form of the Trojans defense. Despite their continued struggles on offense, the Trojans have maintained consistency on the opposite side of the ball throughout the season, and their defense now ranks fourth in the nation at 56.4 points allowed per game. Against Oregon, USC did not allow a point for the first 4:05 of the first half and held the Ducks under the Trojans’ season average.
“It would be our hope to try and bounce back here,” O’Neill said. “It’s just a shame to play that poorly in the second half.“
The Trojans will now face Oregon State on Saturday in their last home game of the year. The second-to-last-place Beavers enter the game at 12-15 and 6-9 in the Pac-10 but have already beat the Trojans once this season in Corvallis, Ore.

USC will host the West Coast Campus Pride College Prep Day & Fair for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender high school students on Saturday, hoping to help the students find a school that suits them and to showcase USC’s LGBT community.
Campus Pride, a non-profit organization that works with LGBT-friendly campuses throughout the country, is partnering with USC’s LGBT Resource Center to host the annual event.
The fair, which began at UC San Diego three years ago, allows high school students and parents to interact with colleges from across the country.
“We work with LGBT colleges across the nation in order to build future leaders and to build safer and friendlier universities,” said Shane Windmeyer, executive director of Campus Pride. “The fair program has taken off.”
The USC LGBT Resource Center approached Windmeyer this year about bringing the fair to Los Angeles.
“We lobbied for it,” said Vincent Vigil, executive director of the LGBT Resource Center. “We thought USC was in a perfect location for this conference. The thought was to bring the event to USC in order to increase attendance and awareness of LGBT events.”
At the fair, students will have the chance to interact with representatives from more than 20 different universities, Windmeyer said. The representatives will be able to talk to prospective students and explain what makes their campuses LGBT-friendly.
Carolyn Laub, executive director of the Gay Straight Alliance Network, said she believes LGBT students look for specific aspects when considering a campus.
“Students look to see that the college has policies that include not only sexual orientation but also gender and expression,” Laub said. “It is important for these students to be accepted on campus and to have nondiscrimination protections.”
Laub said the fair also benefits the participating schools.
“It’s an important way for colleges that are LGBT-friendly to show how much they want to support and include LGBT students,” she said.
USC will be among the schools marketing themselves to LGBT students Saturday.
The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students, written by Windmeyer and published in 2006, named USC one of the top 20 most LGBT-friendly colleges.
Students at USC said they think the LGBT community has improved over the years.
“USC is incredibly LGBT-friendly,” said Richard Fletcher, the assistant director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Assembly. “Seeing how accepting the campus was made me feel more comfortable about my own identity.”
Karen Marcus, public relations chair for the GLBTA, said the group has begun expanding its reach on campus.
“We are reaching out to different sectors,” Marcus said of the organization’s partnerships with campus ethnic and religious groups. “And I think it has worked.”
Fletcher, a USC representative at the fair last year, said the fair would have been useful to him when he was choosing schools.
“It’s a great step for universities to reach out to LGBT students. Vincent has done a great job getting the word out,” Fletcher said.
Unlike other fairs, the event at USC will also feature a college-prep component. The prep day will consist of three workshops in the morning, followed by lunch, the actual fair and a tour of the campus.
The fair will give prospective LGBT students an opportunity to learn about college, how to apply for scholarships and gain insight to the LGBT program.
“Particularly, we want to teach what questions to ask when students are considering to apply,” Windmeyer said.
Vigil said he believes the partnership between USC’s LGBT community and Campus Pride speaks to the heart of the university.
“I think that in relation to USC’s standards in terms of reaching out to the community we are aligned with those standards,” he said.

Students and community members can now dig up some dirt and contribute to the sustainability effort with a new community garden in the North University Park.
The 350-square-foot garden opened Thursday and is located at 3015 Shrine Place. It hopes to be a joint effort between the school and local residents and aims to help feed the hungry.

Student and staff volunteers, working closely with Sustainability Director Matthew Oden and the non-profit organization Urban Farming, manually dumped and raked soil Thursday, marking the first day of work on the garden.
Oden said the idea of a community garden has been in the works for a long time, but the impetus came when Urban Farming contacted the school, interested in starting an organic garden in unused space.
“It just happened to align when we were starting to think about a garden project,” Oden said.
Oden worked with John Baldo, the Undergraduate Student Government’s director of university outreach, to involve student groups, including Environment First and the California Public Interest Research Group. The students researched possibilities and ultimately came to an agreement with Urban Farming to start the project in the USC area.
Oden worked with the USC Real Estate & Asset Management Department to see which USC-owned properties around campus would be suitable for the project. They identified the property on Shrine Place as an area with a large enough yard for the garden.
3015 Shrine Place is owned by USC and is leased by the Department of Public Safety. The building is currently used as headquarters for the Contemporary Services Corporation guards, the security guards in yellow jackets that man various locations around campus.
USC Facilities Management Services gave Oden and his crew the tools needed to start the garden, such as shovels, wheelbarrows and cinderblocks to border the walls of the garden.
So far, Urban Farming has supplied all the necessary seeds and soil and has also contributed tools and volunteers.
Meg Glasser, West Coast regional manager for Urban Farming, will visit the garden every week in the upcoming months to oversee the project and teach USC and community volunteers how to keep the garden going.
Much of the student interest right now is from the few student organizations that have already been volunteering, Baldo said. But he hopes more volunteers will join over time.
“We definitely think a lot of people in the community are interested once we have it set up with signage,” Baldo said. “We’re just getting started now, but we have high hopes.”
Baldo said he hopes to work with the university to eventually integrate the garden into environmentally themed courses on campus.
Right now, the garden will focus on growing summer crops, such as tomatoes, basil and squashes. The ripe crops will be offered to the volunteers who helped grow them.
Eventually, Oden said, he wants to reach out to Tom Sayles, USC’s vice president of government and community relations, to distribute the food to the community.
“We don’t want to just give it away to people who have access to enough food and [are] already paying their bills,” Oden said. “So we’ll work to identify families that truly have the need for the food.”
Shana Rappaport, Green Office Program liaison for the Sustainability Office, started a similar garden outside her house on 30th Street. She said it has garnered a lot of attention from students and community members and hopes the same will happen with the garden on Shrine Place.
“When people actually see food growing out of the ground and get to put their hands in the plant and nurture that food, it’s a really beautiful thing and helps people feel reconnected to the process,” she said.
The next phase of the project, the planting of the seedlings, will take place on Thursday, March 4.
[…] loaves and fishes and remind us that someone nearby may be hungry. USC is doing there part. I found this article impressive. May this Lenten reflection fill you with hope and courage to take action in your own […]

Students from the USC Save Our Selves Coalition and other groups within the Black Student Assembly held a silent protest Thursday in response to what they feel were racist incidents at UC San Diego.

Members of SOS — an organization that holds forums to discuss issues facing the black community — demonstrated by Tommy Trojan on Thursday, protesting a UCSD fraternity-organized party called “Compton Cookout.”
Held during Black History Month, the “Compton Cookout” was a “ghetto-themed” party that encouraged attendees to come dressed for “life in the ghetto.” A Facebook invitation specifically said that women should come dressed as “ghetto chicks“ who “usually have gold teeth, start fights and drama, and wear cheap clothes.”
Many have said the event was a clear example of perpetuating offensive racial stereotypes, and the USC demonstrators said they thought it dehumanized their race. Members of SOS were also dissatisfied with the university’s response.
“The acts of hatred that were targeted specifically last week toward African-Americans actually have been an ongoing event on UCSD’s campus, and the administration does not support the students there,” said Najee Ritter, a sophomore majoring in theatre who served as the group’s spokesperson.
The protest began with about 30 students lined up in front of Tommy Trojan. The demonstration quickly attracted a crowd and grew to include about 100 participants in less than an hour.
“We want to let the University of California system as a whole know that it’s unacceptable to allow funding to programs that perpetuate discrimination against any type of minority group,” Ritter said. “We are trying to stand symbolically in solidarity with those people, with the students [at UCSD], to let them know that their struggle, is also our struggle and their pain is also our pain.”

Participants dressed in all black to represent “a unified body of marginalized individuals forced to suffer from hostile learning environments and administrative neglect,” Ritter said of the group’s planned attire. The participants also sported green and red armbands, colors traditionally associated with African pride. Many wore duct tape covering their mouths.
“It will represent both people who feel that they can’t voice their opinion or speak out when things happen to them. They may feel that they don’t have a venue in which to let these issues or concerns out,” said SOS Secretary Avia Wilkerson, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “At the same time, it can also represent people who see these things happening and don’t do anything about it — basically, people who are being silenced or who are being silent.”
The students were protesting not only UCSD’s “Compton Cookout” but also a racial divide they say is perpetuated by administrative inaction.
“We are silenced when we allow the University of California to use our tax dollars to fund discriminatory publication on our campuses,” Ritter said of UCSD’s The Koala online at the protest. “We are silenced when a public institution of 29,000 students only has 1.3 percent African-Americans. We are silenced when we feel targeted on our campuses, and the university ignores the sentiment of our concerns. We, the students of USC, support our brothers and sisters over at UCSD by standing against hatred, against discrimination, against inequality and in solidarity.”
Many visitors unaffiliated with SOS — and some unaffiliated with USC — joined in the protest.
“What they did at that school was racist, and it shouldn’t have happened if they had any respect for African-American people,” said Kayla Tinker, a sophomore at Crawford High School who joined while attending a tour at USC.
The silent protest made students stop in their tracks as they walked by.
“It’s sad this happened,” said Ryan Morgan, a senior majoring in business administration. “They’re taking it really to heart,” he said of the SOS stand.
Some passers-by thought it was a powerful demonstration.
“It’s fantastic,” said Maxine Chaney, a graduate student studying marine environmental biology who observed the protest. “Students have a lot of power, and I think it’s great they show it.”
Definitely agree that the party was racist/has racist undertones & to think you could have a party called “Compton Cookout” is somewhere between blindly ignorant and completely outrageous.  
HOWEVER
Dont get it twisted, the UC system/State of California is not “funding” this fraternity party.  Fraternity parties/social events are hosted and payed for by the dues of its members.  So its just a bunch of white kids & their parents who are funding this “Compton Cookout”.  Saying the State of California is funding this racist party is simply not true and criticizing the UC system for being racist is a longshot.   Protesting the party is one thing but creating a conspiracy theory about the state of CA and their funding of racist fraternity bashes is just as absurd as the idea of that party
It’s not the parents’ faults, nor did they fund this party directly…don’t get it twisted homie. 
You wanna know who’s to blame? It’s the liberal-left administration that constantly tries in vain to instill in UC students the notion that African-Americans and Latinos are “owed their dues” because of the “innately evil” white man who subjugated them, oppressed them, raped them, exploited them, and so forth. 
White college students are fed up with this “white guilt” that UC schools try to brainwash their students with. My sister went to that “other school” across town, and told me the BS they try to plant in your head, but she’s a lot more intelligent than to buy their skewed and false rhetoric. 
This event in essence is just a way to throw up the middle-finger at the liberal-left. Extreme lefties are nothing but perpetual complainers who look for the worse in capitalism and white Americans. They got nothing positive to say and got chips on their shoulders.
Racism begins with our families, parents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents, people we admire, respect and love.
However, as we grow and mature we come to the realization that what we were told by our family when we were children were slanted lies base on their prejudices. We realize that most people are like ourselves and not so different and want the same things, like a home, steady work, a Medicare plan and schools for our children (if you travel you will see this). We realize that most people are of good hearts and goodwill.
This reminds me of a parable from the good book where a Levite and Priest come upon a man who fell among thieves and they both individually passed by and didn’t stop to help him. Finally a man of another race came by, he got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy and got down with the injured man, administered first aid, and helped the man in need. Jesus ended up saying, this was the good man, this was the great man, because he had the capacity to project the “I” into the “thou,” and to be concerned about his fellow man.
You see, the Levite and the Priest were afraid, they asked themselves, “If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?”
But then the Good Samaritan came by. And he reversed the question: “If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?”
That’s the question before us. The question is not, “If I stop to help our fellow man in need, what will happen to me?” The question is, “If I do not stop to help our fellow man, what will happen to him or her?” That’s the question.
God bless all my brothers and sister that stood side by side with our brothers and sisters in need, when you saw a wrong you tried to correct it, you may argue the methods but not the reasons. I know God will not discriminate by country of origin, our sex, our orientation, color of our skin, or our religion as men do.
I like that movie “Higher Learning.” It was raw, not sugar-coated like all those fake movies that depict white college kids having a blast with one “token black guy” who’s essentially an Uncle Tom. And then you got the whitewashed Asian girl, who throws herself all over the white frat guys. Next you got the Hispanic kids, who essentially got into college by some scholarship because MeCHA has a strong influence at the university. And the point is: they all get along, hold hands and sing ‘we are the world’
Like Rodney King asked, “can’t we all just get along?” 
It’s 2010 y’all. I feel like listening to Public Enemy or KRS-1 to kick some knowledge on these perpetrators of hate.
For those of you who’s anger at the PROTEST of the Compton party stems from unfamiliarity with either the party or a basic history of racial stereotyping here’s a bit of advice, none of which is meant to be patronizing nor spiteful, so please read on with an open mind:
If you can’t understand what was offensive, it could be because you are unfamiliar with the history of the stereotypes of the black struggle. If you have it in your heart to calm your anger and learn more, just go attend a couple SOS meetings or watch Spike Lee’s film “Bamboozled” to get more of an idea of where the hurt and outrage comes from. Read a couple books on race relations, and talk to your black friends about what sorts of things offend them. The world would be a more peaceful place if we all took the time to know more about each other’s past. 
If your anger stems instead from prejudice (which you may or may not know you have), you can combat that by learning more about the cultures you dislike and the policies you seem to think are in place for keeping down white people.
For the record, affirmative action actually doesn’t affect a white person’s admissions rate as students are judged in separate categories. A student from Illinois is compared only to other midwesterners, likewise a black student is only compared to other black students. To be fare, affirmative action would work better if it was done by socioeconomic divisions instead of race, but its currently there as a band-aid to other social ills. If you don’t like affirmative action, support politicians who want to build up public schools. If there were no division of quality of education in our country, we wouldn’t need affirmative action.
Further, here’s a bit from the article linked to in one of the previous posts by another student. The invite begins in a nice way, but it’s clearly tongue in cheek if you read on. Please note the use of language (the switch from a cordial invite to slang) and stereotypes – particularly the demeaning depiction of women:
Read The Invitation To The “Compton Cook Out,” As Posted On Facebook:
“February marks a very important month in American society. No, i’m not referring to Valentines day or Presidents day. I’m talking about Black History month. As a time to celebrate and in hopes of showing respect, the Regents community cordially invites you to its very first Compton Cookout.
For guys: I expect all males to be rockin Jersey’s, stuntin’ up in ya White T (XXXL smallest size acceptable), anything FUBU, Ecko, Rockawear, High/low top Jordans or Dunks, Chains, Jorts, stunner shades, 59 50 hats, Tats, etc.
For girls: For those of you who are unfamiliar with ghetto chicks-Ghetto chicks usually have gold teeth, start fights and drama, and wear cheap clothes – they consider Baby Phat to be high class and expensive couture. They also have short, nappy hair, and usually wear cheap weave, usually in bad colors, such as purple or bright red. They look and act similar to Shenaynay, and speak very loudly, while rolling their neck, and waving their finger in your face. Ghetto chicks have a very limited vocabulary, and attempt to make up for it, by forming new words, such as “constipulated”, or simply cursing persistently, or using other types of vulgarities, and making noises, such as “hmmg!”, or smacking their lips, and making other angry noises,grunts, and faces. The objective is for all you lovely ladies to look, act, and essentially take on these “respectable” qualities throughout the day.
Several of the regents condos will be teaming up to house this monstrosity, so travel house to house and experience the various elements of life in the ghetto.
We will be serving 40’s, Kegs of Natty, dat Purple Drank- which consists of sugar, water, and the color purple , chicken, coolade, and of course Watermelon. So come one and come all, make ya self before we break ya self, keep strapped, get yo shine on, and join us for a day party to be remembered- or not. “
Agree with poster Joe.  Why didn’t USC protesters hike over to UC and set up shop on THEIR campus?  Oh, guess they didn’t hit their quota of “being offended” for today.  Gotta go hunt down an issue over at another campus cuz USC didn’t supply one for them today, eh?  Will also add to Joe’s comment that USC certainly is racist:  reverse racist!  Will jump thru hoops to recruit minorities, especially the Chinese & Indian persuasions, or black athletes.  What, no protest marches for that????
The comments by Mr. Adams are absolutely disgusting and should be removed from this site.
Bah, this whole article including your comments smacks of fake outrage. In a country where nobody believes in racism against blacks, liberals are falling all over themselves to proclaim how outrageously opposed they are to racism against blacks. When anti-black racism was real, you defended it, but only now that it’s finished, you want to prove how sincere you are.
As I said above, it’s lazy and its fake. If you want to be a force for good in the world, how about protesting something that really matters? How about protesting something that somebody on the other side might disagree with? — For example, fight against the anti-semitism that is resurgent on American college campuses (like UC Irvine recently); march in solidarity with the Iranian freedom movement; maybe even hold a tea party protest against the massive power grab currently under way in Washington (fat chance, I know).
Hey Joe, they made a 2010 remake of “we are the world” for Haiti, and soon they’ll make one for Chile. Can you make one for your plight there, “martyr?”
Just clicked to this article. The three silliest things I see going on here:
1) Protest on USC’s campus for something that happend at UCSD? Considering the lengths others have gone to, to stand up for what’s right, this just seems lazy.
2) Students at a private university with active racial discrimination in admissions saying “We want to let the University of California system as a whole know that it’s unacceptable to allow funding to programs that perpetuate discrimination against any type of minority group”. FYI the UC system does not discriminate based on race, USC does.
3) Black activists holding a public protest to highlight the fact that black people can’t make their voices heard, or something.
I would ask that everyone who wanted to know more about the issue prior to jumping to any conclusions about the racist sentiments of either parties identified in this article do some research on what exactly spurred this response. This article gives a  highlight of the issue at hand. http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/education/27sandiego.html?scp=1&sq=compton%20cookout&st=cse
The only thing racist is the USC students who assume that “Compton Cookout” automatically refers to African Americans.
Have you read any of the coverage on this issue? Recognizing when racial stereotypes are at play is not racism.
I agree this Compton Cookout is insulting and deplorable. However, can a university actually penalize students for activities that occur outside the school? If students happen to attend the Trinity United Church of Christ (made famous by Rev. Jeremiah Wright) and some white students were insulted by its racial sermons – would the university step in? Anything short of inciting violence, we need to allow idiots and haters to show their true colors by engaging in activities like this Compton cookout. believe me – in this YouTube generation where everything is recorded for in perpetuity, here are going to be plenty of red-faced people 10 years from now when they try to run for public office or become CEO of a large company. We need to tag and release these idiots right now by letting them do their thing
Interesting point of view. Let their dumb actions haunt them down the road huh? 
That works sometimes. Human beings have a tendency to forget about things, even disgraceful things. For me personally, whenever someone wrongs me, I don’t forgive nor forget. I’ll only do so if that person is contrite, and contrition is demonstrated through changed character. But most people don’t change, not even years after.
my order: fried chicken, bisquits, waffles will do if you ain’t got the bisquits, some welch’s strawberry drink and a big ass watermelon, and that’s on my momma.
Instead of an apology there has been steady escalation and now the noose. So, what exactly will the excuses be for this cowardly act that brings up memories of the confederate KKK of the South in their attempts to keep slavery and the non-whites in fear?  Is it that are uneducated, is it that their parents planted these seeds of hate, is it that they are live in fear because our President in the white house is not 100% white.  This is what the republican party of “birthers, baggers and blowhards” have brought you.  These kids follow what their dullard leaders say, they are young and dumb.  Are you surprise at what they do when you know what they think?  Of course it could be an off-campus dullard who listens to Beck, Hedgecock, Hannity, O’Reilly, Rush and Savage and the rest of the Blowhards.

Facing top-10 ranked Hawai’i, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team knew that a win wouldn’t come easily, but 32 minutes later the Women of Troy exited McDonald’s Swim Stadium with a 14-7 win.
The win marked USC’s first in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, as senior two-meter Kami Craig led the team with four goals, powering a scoring barrage that saw nine different players record at fewest one goal.
“We knew we had to come out with a lot of energy in this game,” Craig said. “We wanted to switch the momentum and gain some confidence heading into the Irvine tournament this weekend. So it was just a continuous battle throughout the game, and we eventually caught up with Hawai’i in the third quarter.”
USC (7-1, 1-0) got off to a sluggish start once again, as they failed to get on the scoreboard until midway through the opening period before eventually tallying six first-half goals to give the Women of Troy a three-goal halftime lead.
The third quarter, however, marked a strong momentum shift for the Women of Troy, as they recorded five goals to put themselves in the driver’s seat. Craig tallied three goals in the period to reach 128 career goals, taking over as USC’s 10th all-time leading scorer.
But Craig wasn’t the only one who got in a rhythm offensively in the second half. Sophomore drivers also tallied three goals to help put the team in a comfortable position. The offensive display made it incredibly tough on a Hawai’i team that grew tired as the game wore on.
“Hawai’i got tired because we played a physical defense and were able to push it quite a bit,” said USC head coach Jovan Vavic. “It was tough on them because they don’t have a deep team. We were able to play more players and that made a difference.”
That type of aggressive defense, which jumpstarted USC’s offense and made it incredibly difficult on the Rainbow Wahine (5-5, 0-2) offense, was even more stifling than in weeks past. Even a normally pessimistic Vavic took note of the team’s improved play.
“We’re definitely doing a better job defensively,” Vavic said. “I think overall, our defense is picking up. Defense is all about attitude. Anybody can play defense. You just need to be focused to play.”
With an impressive victory in hand, USC now heads south to participate in the challenging UC Irvine Invitational this weekend. On Saturday, the Women of Troy will open group play against Long Beach State, a team they already defeated 13-3 in their season opener earlier this month.
“We’re excited to learn from our last mistakes from the last tournament,” Craig said. “We have a whole new attitude now and a little burning desire to get revenge.”

For the second consecutive season, the St. Mary’s Gaels need an additional basketball game to enhance their power rating and to give the NCAA selection committee another reason for the Gaels to earn a spot in postseason play.
The Gaels and head coach Randy Bennett faced a similar situation last season, but were saved with a game against Eastern Washington of the Big Sky Conference. Though the Gaels won the game, they still did not receive a bid to the NCAA tournament.
Bennett has said that his team has discussed whether or not to have a rematch with USC (USC beat them in the Diamond Head Classic 60-49) in order to replace the missed opportunity, but he said that it is unlikely  the two teams will play.
USC coach Kevin O’Neill has not received a phone call from Bennett, but would consider playing the Gaels if USC’s self-imposed sanctions allowed it to do so.
“[Saint Mary’s] never talked to me,” O’Neill said on ESPN.com. “But no one from there [Saint Mary’s] called me about it. I’d play any game. I don’t know if we’d be allowed to do that with our sanctions.”
Even if the Gaels do call O’Neill and the NCAA permits the game, the selection committee may view the game as inconsequential because the Trojans have a self-imposed ban and will not be able to play in the post-season.
With nothing to play for besides integrity, the Trojans may not be the best opponent for the Gaels to convince the selection committee that they belong in the postseason.

Puppetry of the Penis is exactly what you think it is — or maybe it’s not. The creators have lovingly dubbed it the “ancient Australian art of genital origami,” and, though the show’s creators are indeed Australian and genital origami is an overly sophisticated description of their stage performance, the ancient origins of their craft are questionable.
Flashy · Christopher Cannon and Rich Binning are the show’s “puppeteers.” Both are pursuing careers in the comedy side of acting. - Photos courtesy of Davidson and Choy Publicity 
Puppetry of the Penis began in 1996 as the title of a calendar created by Simon Morley featuring 12 photos of penises in various contortionist positions. After the calendar was distributed, Morley began to receive requests for live performances of what he also calls “Dick Tricks.” Morley chose David Friend as his performing partner, and by 1998 they were ready to debut the show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
Following the festival, they toured Australia where the show was a sure-fire hit. From playing in London’s West End to being in New York for two years and touring countries such as Germany, Ireland, Italy, Canada and South Africa, much of the world has witnessed a massive array of penis shapings. Now in its 12th year, Morley and Friend are no longer the puppeteers, as a new and younger cast has replaced them.
The show begins with a half-hour stand-up comedy act to warm up the audience for what is about to come. The current incarnation of the show at Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood features a rotation of female comedian openers. Because biology prevents women from participating in the show, they are given the opportunity to do stand-up beforehand. Once the audience has laughed at jokes about sexual escapades, the real show begins.
The current puppeteers are recent college graduates Rich Binning and Christopher Cannon. Cannon first began doing penis tricks in college after purchasing Morley and Friend’s instructional how-to book, Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Australian Art of Genital Origami.
“I thought it would be a fun thing to do for a while,” Cannon said. “It became a drunk party trick in college.”
Cannon’s origami abilities caught the eye of Binning, who then learned the tricks as well. After Cannon and Binning graduated together from Point Park University, they heard about an open casting call for the show in New York City. Following a nine week off-Broadway run in August of 2009, the pair traveled with the show to Canada and is now here in West Hollywood.
“I had always been familiar with the show,” Binning said, “and I’ve always been an open person.”
The show is meant to be funny not sexual, and, despite the grotesque subject matter, Cannon and Binning try to keep it clean. The two enter the stage wearing capes and, after disrobing, present over 40 installations — named by what they are meant to look like — to the audience.
Between tricks, Cannon and Binning banter back and forth, most of which is scripted, though their ease makes it appear as though they are just two friends doing improv comedy.
“Some people get up and walk out,” Cannon said, “but we try to keep it as funny as possible.”
Installations with names like “Hamburger” and “Eiffel Tower” might seem crude in concept, but they are really just another example of our culture’s love of experimentation with the mimicking abilities of the human body. Using genitalia to create recognizable objects is a more taboo version of creating shadow puppets or perfecting a celebrity impression. And if there is an audience for it, why not share it?
At the end of the show, Cannon and Binning invite any males to come up on stage to learn how to do one of the installations. And the participants range from intrigued college-agers to curious 80-year-olds.
“When someone else comes on stage, it can change the dynamic,” Binning said.
One cannot help but wonder how doing such a show affects the performers’ dating lives. For Binning, it does not, since he is happily married to the camera operator of the show.
“We’re both comfortable with it,” Binning said.
Cannon, on the other hand, stays away from dating on the road, though he is quite popular with the older women in the audience who often grab him after the show and try to seduce him.
“You wouldn’t believe the amount of cougarage we see after the show,” Cannon said.
Puppetry is only the beginning for Cannon and Binning. Though only Cannon says he won’t do porn, both are pursuing careers in the comedy world. For now, they are just two friends making people laugh every night — they just happen to be naked while doing it.
“It’s an honor for me and my genitals to be doing something like this,” Cannon said.
I hope your puppets don’t get stage fright.

As students and members of the USC community, we are acutely aware of the dangers around campus. Fortunately, the Department of Public Safety does an excellent job of keeping community members protected and informed of incidents by publicizing crime alerts and demonstrating a commitment to providing students with crucial information about our safety.
In a larger context, we are also conscious of the fact that there are threats to our national security. Earlier this month, the government released several reports on terrorism.
The Department of Homeland Security’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and the Pentagon’s Quadrennial Defense Review outline the homeland security strategy for the next four years, but there was something unusual about both reports.
Though they included extensive wording on terrorism and extremism, neither report mentioned any derivatives of “Islamism” whatsoever. Instead, the writers chose words like “violent extremists” and “al Qaeda” to describe the suspects. Of course, the writers refused to acknowledge that this was a purposeful omission,
Previously, in 2008, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) published “Words that Work and Words that Don’t: A Guide for Counterterrorism Communication,” a report discouraging the use of the words “Muslim” or “Islamic” to describe terrorist threats. According to the NCTC, doing so perpetuates the “U.S. vs. Islam framework” that only detracts from finding a solution.
While it is imperative not to make a connection between the words “Muslim” and “terrorist” this particular situation might prove problematic.
Being politically correct is one thing, but it is another to omit facts for fear of creating a bigger mess.
A number of critics have surfaced to evaluate the reports. Sen. Susan Collins deems the “glaring omission” made by the two agencies unacceptable. She said, “While there are other threats to our national security from other types of violent extremism, the gravest threat comes from Islamist extremists … In a review such as this, it is critical that we identify and address the specific threat posed by Islamist extremism.”
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Identifying the enemy — their background, nationality, race, religion — is crucial to combating threats. In our microcosm of the world, DPS alerts us with details about suspect appearances.
For example, a recent crime alert from Feb. 19 describes a suspect of a strong armed robbery as being a black male, listing his height, weight and dress.  Isn’t the point of filing such reports to alert people of all necessary facts? It promotes transparency and, thus, a greater awareness of our safety.
Is it religion’s involvement that complicates the situation? Are we okay with providing biological facts about a suspect but would prefer to steer clear of bringing the issue of religion into the fray?
Perhaps it isn’t bigoted to claim that Muslim extremists are the most significant threat to national security, when that might actually be the case. Of course, it is important not to rely on prejudices and stereotypes. But the country’s so-called “collective guilt,” when it comes to repenting for the sins of the past — for enacting racist laws and breeding narrow-mindedness, among many other things — surely shouldn’t continue perpetually.
With all due respect and without incensing the masses, it is important to realize that being politically correct can only take us so far. Sometimes, it takes us in the wrong direction.
It doesn’t help that the Department of Homeland Security’s report was the first of its kind from the department. By creating the precedent of omitting this sort of crucial information, what does it mean for our security? Is it protecting the identities of the suspects? Is it taking measures to be politically correct to avoid stepping on the toes of human rights activists?
The NCTC suggests using “death cult” to describe terrorists.  Is that a better way to characterize these individuals? I think not.
If this is a matter of a mere error in semantics or of staying on every party’s good side, then those policymakers have failed to achieve their goals.

Love the lead-in! I definitely agree that sometimes the crucial facts are compromised in order to avoid hurting anyone’s feelings.
This article is full of hypocrisy and political correctness. All of us know that we fighting our crusades against Islam and Muslims all over the world. Trying to use words like “Islamism” and “Islamist” sounds like bogus cover against the truth.
Agree with the article. Also, smart people know that “Islamism”, the jihadist movement to destroy non-Muslims and take over the world, is not the same thing as “Islam”, the religion. Islamic extremists are no friends to mainstream Muslims — a study recently showed that almost ALL of the victims of Islamic terrorism are themselves Muslim: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jan/14/al-qaeda-hurts-muslims-most/. Our leaders should be able to make it clear that we are fighting militant Islamism, call it “jihad” if you want, but that we are not at war with Islam.

He pled guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl more than 30 years ago and then spent three decades as a fugitive, but director Roman Polanski is still able to make a film and actually have people go see it.
Considering all the intense media scrutiny of Polanski’s September arrest in Switzerland for a 1978 statutory rape charge — and the ongoing debate surrounding whether or not the director should still face sentencing — it would seem almost impossible for him to continue making art. But Polanski did just that last weekend with the release of his latest film The Ghost Writer.

Although the film was only released in two U.S. cities — New York and Los Angeles — The Ghost Writer has still enjoyed substantial box office sales. According to Daily Variety, Polanski’s film grossed almost $222,000 since it opened Feb. 19.
That might not sound like all that much money when compared to the numbers that came in for Shutter Island, which came out the same day and has made almost $50 million in its first week. But unlike the Martin Scorsese picture, which was released in about 3,000 theaters nationwide, Polanski’s film was only released in four theaters. All things considered, $222,000 is a fair amount of revenue.
And this proves people are actually going out of their way to see this film knowing that the man who directed it has been arrested under charges of unlawful sex with a minor. This says a great deal about the separation between an artist and his work, especially when that artist’s troubles have been so greatly publicized.
If an artist produces a truly great piece of work, should that work be shunned simply because he has behaved inappropriately?
Polanski’s time as a fugitive has never slowed him down. His legal troubles are well known by everyone in Hollywood and Europe, but he still won an Academy Award for best birector for his 2002 film The Pianist. And as box office numbers have illustrated with The Ghost Writer, audiences are still willing to give Polanski the benefit of the doubt.
Hollywood celebrities have always been involved in sticky situations, and not all of them have been as lucky as Polanski to emerge from scandals with their popularity intact. There are a notable few whose careers were almost ruined because of legal troubles.
On the run · Polanski’s most recent film, The Ghost Writer, was created primarily while the director was evading arrest for a statutory rape charge. His situation is not without precedent in Hollywood. - Photo courtesy of Summit Entertainment 
A similar statutory rape case spawned the catch phrase “In like Flynn” in the early 1940s when popular screen actor Errol Flynn was accused of having sex with two underage girls. With an already established reputation as a womanizer, Flynn’s trial started in 1943, and many believed the actor’s career hung in the balance.
Conversely, Flynn’s trial did nothing but help his career. After being cleared of the charges, the ordeal only further solidified his reputation and immense popularity. He was able to survive all of the accusations and turmoil, and as a result Errol Flynn is still regarded as one of the superstars of Hollywood’s Golden Age.
Though his physical relationships never instigated legal action, Charlie Chaplin’s love affairs also involved scandalous and, what many would consider, inappropriate behavior. Chaplin, one of Hollywood’s first stars to have several underage lovers, is nevertheless still highly regarded . It is his filmography and his incredibly unique on-screen character that are remembered, not his potentially suspect love affairs.
But what will come of Polanski?
He still has the talent, and audiences can still recognize it, but, with his legal troubles far from being over, the director’s future is still uncertain.
Audience members must now look to his art as the only accurate example of what Polanski can still offer us. The Ghost Writer will eventually see a wider distribution, and more people will be able to see it, but it is still not clear how many will actually want to watch a film by Polanski, considering the identity of the man behind the art.

Strange that some rape survivors actually say so in their own blogs – but I guess you haven’t read them. I could point you to some if need be. Then you could unload your hatred at them.
Wait a minute, you’re the guy excusing, no, *supporting* Roman Polanski, monstrous repeat child rapist, and you’re accusing me of “hatred” of rape victims? Kid, moral relativism is a philosophical dead end. Try reading what you’ve written two or three times and really think about the implications of it.
Joe, ‘pal’ – who says Polanski is a ‘repeat rapist’, hm? As far as Geimer’s concerned he didn’t even ‘rape’ her. Besides, my comment was meant for all, in reference to that you all think no rape victim supports him, and not that you hate rape victims, but that you could unload this hatred you show for Polanski at those who support him, not me pointing you to them. Maybe YOU should read my posts better, and I might link you to some rape survivors who do support him. But I guess you’d think they’re all loopy or not ‘real victims’ in contrast.
Joe, you’re obviously blind not to see that there was no sodomy. What she said then has no meaning in the face of hard medical evidence discrediting it flat-out. She also said that Huston had interrupted them, which means she was perfectly aware to call on her help, only to let him return and sodomise her again? I don’t think so. Polanski said she didn’t interrupt them and anal intercourse requires lubricant not to hurt or cause damage in case you don’t realise that, let alone ‘dry double sodomy’ she implies, and I doubt he had a handy pot ready. Quaaludes in the small amount she took doesn’t make you ‘pliant’, it makes you euphoric and horny. Taken as whole pill it makes you relaxed, not sedate. What other ‘writings’ say to the effect of his ‘screwing adolescent girls’ is as meaningless as any other to discredit him. To me only the fact that it wasn’t forcible rape/sodomy is relevant, regardless of her age. End of story.
I pity the future girlfriend/wife/sister/daughter/granddaughter/female friends/anyone else with a vagina that has the displeasure of encountering you in real life, Marshal.
It is people like you that remind me of why I will, sadly, always have a job. And why working as a rape crisis counselor/advocate is so essential in this society.
You said it! My recommendation for Marshal is to take the “sunshine test”: read the sentence you just wrote, aloud, in a mixed crowd of adults, and see how they respond. If you can’t explain the sodomy/lube/Quaalude/pre-teen issue in the light of day, that’s a hint that you might need to re-think it..
haha, Joe that is fantastic.
I read Marshal’s “On the contrary, many rape survivors support him because they do know what real rape is…” statement out loud to a roomful of people. The general reaction was “Oh my God…did he REALLY just say that?”
As someone who works day in and day out with and/or for sexual assault survivors, I can say with full confidence that I do not know of a single survivor who *supports* Polanski. I know plenty of survivors who no longer hate their attackers, nor wish them ill, and have found healing–but none of them would “support” a rapist. Much less a child rapist like Polanski.
Paragraph, I mean, not sentence.
I’m not going to engage ‘what the hell’s’ shortsighted assumption that any Polanski defender doesn’t know what rape is. And here’s proof that it wasn’t forcible rape and sodomy first of all.

On the contrary, many rape survivors support him because they do know what real rape is, and to her own words, this was not. The public have no right to ignore her own stand these days to the events of then. What she told the grand jury differs greatly from what she had said over the last decades, and any article citing the old testimony has no validity of being factual, as long as these claims have not been proven in any court. They never have.
And Joe, he never admitted to any of what you said, and he pled to unlawful sex and the other counts were therefore dropped. The case never went to trial on the pressure of the mother because they had no case of rape or sodomy, no one wanted him incarcerated, and the other counts as a result are to this day mere allegations. Just like her never impugned original statement in fact. The legal side and flight reason was explained already, and if you all want to continue believing in the unproven rape/sodomy details of this case, instead of finding real rapists and paedophiles, that is your problem entirely.
Marshal, when an adult sodomizes a 13-year-old, it’s rape. Just because the drugs made her *pliant* doesn’t mean she *consented*. (And even if she had consented, she was still *13 years old*). In other interviews and writings he has admitted to screwing at least two other adolescent girls… this was in the news a few months ago when he was arrested by the Swiss.
This article is disgusting. Look at this quote, one of many: “…not all of them have been as lucky as Polanski to emerge from scandals with their popularity intact. There are a notable few whose careers were almost ruined because of legal troubles.” The student who wrote this article is trying to create the sense that a “scandal” just HAPPENED to Polanski. Poor unlucky Roman Polanski. Could have happened to anyone. What a tragedy.
As has been pointed out, Roman Polanski admitted to drugging, forcibly raping, and sodomizing a 13-year-old against her protestations. From his own comments he is known to have raped at least a couple other young girls in cases that were never brought to trial. 
These are not “troubles” which “befell” Roman Polanski. His sentence may be in dispute, but his guilt is not — he has admitted to these monstrous crimes, and openly admits that he is a fugitive only because he didn’t want to serve his sentence. Don’t kid yourself that you’re defending a “misunderstood” artist who “allegedly” did something “controversial”.
I understand that you’re trying to make a case for evaluating Polanski’s art based solely on its merit, instead of allowing his crimes to influence our judgment of his work. But marginalizing the rape and tagging on a headline that suggests he be a role model (“Embattled Polanski provides a model for troubled stars”) isn’t just insensitive–it’s downright offensive.
Just in case you’ve forgotten, here’s an article to remind you of exactly what he did 32 years ago, and pled guilty to:
Reminder: Roman Polanski raped a child
By Kate Harding
http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/28/polanski_arrest/
“Roman Polanski raped a child. Let’s just start right there, because that’s the detail that tends to get neglected… Let’s keep in mind that Roman Polanski gave a 13-year-old girl a Quaalude and champagne, then raped her… let’s take a moment to recall that according to the victim’s grand jury testimony, Roman Polanski instructed her to get into a jacuzzi naked, refused to take her home when she begged to go, began kissing her even though she said no and asked him to stop; performed cunnilingus on her as she said no and asked him to stop; put his penis in her vagina as she said no and asked him to stop; asked if he could penetrate her anally, to which she replied, “No,” then went ahead and did it anyway, until he had an orgasm.”
If the so called victim tells us over and over these days that it wasn’t ‘an atrocious act of sexual violence’, but ‘that he had sex with her’, ‘didn’t harm her’, ‘wasn’t mean or anything like that’ (her words), he’s neither a rapist or paedophile by findings already then, since ‘what the hell’ obviously has no clear idea about their meaning either. What she said three decades ago was never impugned in a trial and therefore still only allegations to this day. Medical evidence didn’t support her claims already then, and that’s why they struck a plea bargain on mom’s pressure with no jail time demand. The judge eventually reneged on their agreement to let Polanski go free on probation, to save his own face, and therefore was removed by both attorneys for multiple illegal transgressions which had triggered Polanski to flee, because he would have to appeal any sentence they had not agreed on and was threatened with illegal deportation the judge was not empowered to enforce on any defendant – that’s the factual short of it. 
There was no evidence of rape or sodomy, she took the bit of drug and champagne on her own accord, and she wasn’t out of her skull not to resist as she had claimed then. Her old story could not be corroborated by potential witnesses either, she more and more came to amend over time to in fact resemble more what he had said happened and that’s what he pled to, unlawful sex with a minor and the fact that she couldn’t consent, till she even outright pleaded for his release on several occasions even before a received settlement. I doubt any real rape victim would ever do that; they would call for his incarceration she never wanted then or now, not file petitions for his release since years now. But the courts did not only ignore him, but her calls to have the case dismissed to play with it some more by several other judges for their own reasons, nor sentenced him.  
The fact that so many support him and that he could continue his work proves that they know better and the case was/is much more complex on many levels than people realise. Today it has been blown out of all proportions and is being politically exploited by some ambitious DA, and another judge who just spins it out as it was since three decades now, despite plenty of chances to close it both parties had demanded. That’s why the Swiss didn’t extradite him and never will. Unless they courts can prove he was up for more than what he had sat out already, since they don’t extradite anyone who wasn’t subject to more than half a year sentence. The current judge too has refused to sentence him, since that would give Polanski the chance to appeal, and moreover automatically force the courts to deal with all the exposed backroom dealings and the judge’s misconduct from three decades ago they cannot just brush under legal carpet anymore. But obviously they want to leave their old dirty dealings kept out of sight, and are unable to prove he was to be sentenced for longer.
“If the so called victim tells us over and over these days that it wasn’t ‘an atrocious act of sexual violence’, but ‘that he had sex with her’, ‘didn’t harm her’, ‘wasn’t mean or anything like that’ (her words), he’s neither a rapist or paedophile by findings already then, since ‘what the hell’ obviously has no clear idea about their meaning either.”
No, my dear, you are the one that is terribly confused and uninformed. Polanski admitted himself that he IS indeed a rapist. Even if he “only” committed “statutory rape,” that is still RAPE and he is still a RAPIST. He pled guilty to the lesser charge of statutory rape in order to avoid jail time. That does not mean he was innocent of the more severe charges. The victim’s grand jury testimony was more than enough to get an indictment for all 5 of the original charges. As for you “factual short” of what happened, you have a very skewed definition of “factual.”
As for Polanski being a pedophile, again, what exactly is YOUR definition? She was a 13 child–not a woman, not an adult. A child. Polanski took pleasure in raping her and performing sexual acts (all against her will) on her. Sounds like a pedophile to me…
“There was no evidence of rape or sodomy, she took the bit of drug and champagne on her own accord, and she wasn’t out of her skull not to resist as she had claimed then.”
Really? What exactly are your sources for that one, dear? We unfortunately didn’t have DNA evidence at the time, and our forensic pelvic exams were terribly ineffective (and in most cases non-existent) when he committed his crime. “Lucky” for him. And a 13 year old willing took a Quaalude? Are you kidding me? She was 13! HE supplied to alcohol AND the drugs. And if even *IF* she had consumed both willingly, that does not excuse his behavior. If anything, it makes his actions more even more horrific. Not only could she not legally consent because of her age, but the fact that she was drugged and intoxicated even further nullifies any argument for consent.
“I doubt any real rape victim would ever do that”
You clearly know absolutely nothing about rape. Or rape victims. Or the aftermath of sexual assault. A “real rape victim”? You are disgusting.
Every survivor of rape or sexual assault is going to respond differently–everyone heals in their own way and comes to terms with their experiences through a very personal process. I am happy for the Polanski’s victim, that she feels she has been able to move on and heal from what happened. That is great. But that by no means minimizes what Polanski did. The survivors of the Rwandan genocide have also learned to forgive and move on, and many have called for the release of the genocide perpetrators there as well–but that does not change the horror of what happened there. Humans have an incredibly capacity to survive and overcome the past. But that doesn’t absolve the perpetrators of their guilt, nor take away from the suffering and pain the survivors had to go through in order to reach a place of healing.
\”they would call for his incarceration she never wanted then or now, not file petitions for his release since years now. But the courts did not only ignore him, but her calls to have the case dismissed to play with it some more by several other judges for their own reasons, nor sentenced him.”
Was there actually supposed to be a coherent sentence in there somewhere?
You sound like an abysmal “human being”…and I use that term very loosely as well.
Are you kidding me?
I just threw up reading this. Disgusting.
He didn’t just have “unlawful sex” with a minor–HE RAPED HER. He plied her with alcohol, DRUGGED her, and RAPED her. A 34 year old pedophiliac, narcissistic “man” (and I use that term incredibly loosely) drugged and raped a protesting 13 year old child–and not only did he rape her, he sodomized her, and forced oral copulation, among other “lewd and lascivious acts.”
I have officially lost all respect for the author of this article.
The fact that Polanski managed to live peacefully and untroubled by the consequences of his disgusting and reprehensible behavior is not a sign of his “success”–it is a sign of the dismal state of our society. It is repulsive to see how quickly the public forgave a sexual predator. I don’t care how talented he is. He still committed an atrocious crime of sexual violence, and he absolutely needs to receive his long overdue punishment. Just because he ran away from his responsibilities 30 years ago does NOT give him a pass to continue living freely.
This is just one more example of the incredible culture of impunity surrounding sexual assault and sexual violence in our society. i don’t care if the offender is potentially the person who will find the cure for cancer. That in no way, shape, or form absolves the offender of his guilt. It does not excuse the horrendous acts of sexual violence. And it should not, no matter what, give him a free pass.
Screw Polanski. He deserves it.

As we are almost halfway through the spring semester, many students are now beginning to grow worried about summer.
No, it’s not because of those bothersome mosquitoes, that soaring heat wave or those extra pounds to shed for  that sexy bikini. It’s because they are struggling to find an internship — and, more so, a paid one.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
“While a lot of my friends have taken unpaid internships in the summer to boost their résumés, I can’t afford to do that. With each internship experience of theirs, I notice the increasing gap between them and me,” said Siyu Fan, a sophomore majoring in communication. “They are able to afford experiences that I cannot at this point, and these experiences definitely serve as bonuses for their future job searches.”
Many undergraduate students fight to balance the rigors of college with the need to earn an adequate amount of money to fund their college tuition and everyday expenses. Their plight thereby forces them to question the fairness of unpaid internships.
This, however, is not the only area of concern. Some employers ask that students receive college credit as a form of “compensation” for their work in order to evade paying them; a requirement that clearly puts students of low economic status at a disadvantage. It means that students have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars in tuition for that course. Essentially, they are paying instead of being paid for their work as an intern.
With dozens of employers on campus this  week in light of Internship Week, hundreds of eager Trojans are flocking to the Student Union Building just to throw in their résumés.
Along with benefiting students, Internship Week aids businesses in their search for bright and talented individuals who have the potential to become full-time hires. At least, it is supposed to do that. How can companies hire the best and most intelligent students when having unpaid internship programs expels almost half of the potential applicant pool?
According to InternBridge.com, a company that conducts the largest internship-focused research in the country, 18 percent of more than 42,000 student interns surveyed did not receive pay or college credit, a major violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Of those that received college credit for their internship, 71 percent had to pay for the credits themselves.
While some businesses simply cannot afford to pay their interns, many can yet don’t because of a steady, high demand for internship experience. “There’s a constant supply of students willing to work for free,” said Richard Bottner, president of InternBridge.com, “and this is part of the problem.”
Yet, a study conducted by National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) revealed that paid interns report having a more positive overall experience at their internship than unpaid interns. Edwin Koc, director of strategic and foundation research for NACE said, “Students who express dissatisfaction with the internship program felt like they had been exploited because they hadn’t been paid, and not being paid frequently coincided with being given what they referred to as ‘not meaningful work.’”
There is no doubt that internships are valuable, especially in trying to get a leg up on the competition in this economy. But next time, think twice when employers tell you that their internships are unpaid. Is their only goal to find the best and brightest students across USC?
I don’t think so.
Amrita Parekh is a sophomore majoring in communication and psychology.
As an unpaid intern, you are in essence, fodder. These companies don’t give a hoot about you after you’re done with your stint. 
Yep, just exploit hungry college students who in earnest are willing to make sacrifices (unpaid internships) just to try to get a J-O-B.

When Aaron Boone stepped on to Deudeaux Field for the first time as a freshman in 1992, the business administration major and newly crowned third baseman had big shoes to fill.
The Orange County native was not only a member of the prestigious Trojan baseball family, but also of the Boone family, arguably the most successful blood lines in the history of baseball.
To make matters worse for the third generation baseball standout, his older brother, Bret, had already compiled a highly successful career in Cardinal and Gold, as he was voted a two-time All-American by Baseball America in 1989 and 1990, while etching his name in several categories of the Trojans’ record book.
After three years, an All-American honor of his own and a career .308 batting average at USC, Aaron Boone joined his brother as one of the most accomplished athletes in the program’s recent history.
But if his time in Southern California was defined as a period of great achievement, Boone’s professional career more than lived up to the families pedigree.
In a 14-year career that featured stints with six teams, an All-Star appearance in 2003 and the legendary walk-off home run that won Game Seven of the 2003 American League Championship Series for the New York Yankees, Boone’s career paid tribute to an athlete who didn’t shy away from the bright lights and expectations that came with carrying on the family name.
For an infielder who many scouts projected as a rarely used utility man when he first came up through the minor leagues, the former-Trojan exemplified the meaning of fighting on.
But if his career .263 batting average, 126 home runs, and 555 runs batted in fail to tell the whole story, Boone’s battle to get back on the baseball diamond last year says it all.
On March 26 of last year, Boone underwent open-heart surgery to replace a bicuspid aortic valve, a condition that he has suffered from since childhood. The surgery, although not thought to be life-threatening, was serious enough for Boone to consider quitting the major leagues.
However, for a family that has made their mark on the sport of baseball as much for their on-field performance as the grit and passion they played with, in fitting Boone tradition, the former-USC third baseman didn’t give up.
On Sept. 2, only five months after his surgery, Boone returned to the place that had offered security and refuge since the time he was a young boy: the baseball field. Although he would return by going 0-for-3 with the Houston Astros, his presence alone was a testament to his resiliency amidst grave odds- a trait that defined his career from day one.
In appropriate form for an athlete who constantly succeeded despite playing in the shadows of his highly-gifted family members, Boone announced his retirement this week without much fanfare or much celebration.
Boone, in attempt to remain active in the game of baseball, also announced that he will be joining ESPN immediately, as a full-time MLB analyst. The man he replaces is the reputable, Hall of Fame journalist Peter Gammons. Just another day in the life of a man, all too familiar with the role of filling big shoes.

Sororities at USC are hoping to prove their diversity with the results of a recent census that surveyed the majors of members of Panhellenic sororities.
Hitting the books · Members of Delta Gamma study at their house. Panhellenic recently surveyed its members to demonstrate its diversity. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
Ayushi Gummadi, vice president of scholarship for the Panhellenic Council, organized the census to provide support for the claim that Greek houses are now more diverse than ever before.
Of the five houses that responded to the census, approximately 60 different majors were represented. There were 503 responses, though the number is inflated because some women had more than one major.
Representatives of the sororities were quick to point out the range of majors within their own houses.
“We’re pretty diverse,” said Sagan Blue, vice president of Intellectual Development for Alpha Chi Omega sorority. “We have representatives from most of the schools, from accounting to gerontology. We’re pretty well representative of most of what USC has to offer.”
Diversity within the house is often touted as an important goal of all sororities. Though there are no diversity quotas to influence selection of girls, all houses emphasize the value of having a variety of majors among members.
“It’s important because it allows us to experience and interact with different people,” said Charlotte Chan, scholarship chair for Gamma Phi Beta sorority. “We don’t live in a bubble where everyone is interested in the same thing. We have the opportunity to become friends and spend time with people who have different interests.”
Gummadi said the results of this census are also important in combating the stereotypes about the Greek community.
“There is a perception that all Greeks are communication majors, and that’s not true,” said Gummadi. “There are so many different types of majors, people doing so many amazing things. It’s really important for the university to know that.”
Still, the census might not reflect diversity as well as the Greek system would have liked.
The two most popular majors, by a large margin, were business administration and communication. Seven of the majors were studied by more than 20 girls: psychology, journalism, engineering, international relations and those who identified themselves as undeclared, in addition to the business and communication majors.
More than half of the majors included in the census report are being studied by less than five women.
Donald La, a junior majoring in business administration and accounting and not affiliated with the Greek system, said he thinks there are some stereotypes associated with the Greek community and that this census might not do much to fight them.
“There are definitely stereotypes for girls in Greek houses,” he said. “It depends on who you talk to. Some people will stereotype and some won’t.”
La said he’s not sure the census data means much.
“Based on the census statistics, that doesn’t give them a right to say that they’re diverse,” he said. “I think they’re just stating that they’re diverse so they can get more people to apply.”
But Gummadi said the data does help fight preconceptions.
“I think the data disproves stereotypes,” she said. “Marshall and Annenberg are two of the top schools. Obviously people are going to take advantage of that; but looking at the census data, there are so many other majors represented as well.”
Ashley Prescott, a senior majoring in communication and a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority, said she hopes the census helps disprove the stereotypes because she feels they don’t hold true.
“I don’t like the stereotypes and I hate that communication is always seen as an easy major because it’s not,” she said. “From my perspective, there is a lot of diversity, but there are major groups. We have the business [administration] major group, we have a group of communication students, and then we have a group of engineering students and some bio majors.”
Gummadi said the Greek system is merely keeping pace with university trends.
“I don’t think it’s something to be surprised about,” Gummadi said. “It’s not unique to the Greek community. The Greek community is a microcosm for the university as a whole.”
Chan said this data shows a change even over the past few years.
“There’s been a big change,” she said. “Even from when I was a freshman to this year … So many members this year just have more diverse majors.”
Chan cited two possible reasons for this change.
“Either the girls in general are branching out and trying different majors, or more specifically there could be another possibility — that Greek life is attracting different kinds of girls,” she said.
A number of sororities are hoping the census will help change student perceptions of Greek life.
“I think it’s important for people to have an accurate view of sororities,” Blue said. “That we aren’t just all the same — that even within the houses we’re not all the same.”

Hoping to make science more accessible to a wide range of people, the National Science Foundation and the USC School of Cinematic Arts have teamed up to create a new initiative that combines science and interactive media.
Moving pictures · The National Science Foundation and the USC School of Cinematic arts are aiming to make science more accessible. - Daily Trojan File Photo 
The Creative Science Studio, known as CS2,  aims to educate large audiences about contemporary issues in the world of science through interactive media outlets.
The idea began with NSF, which developed the concept along with USC’s Research Advancement Office in Washington, D.C. NSF had partnered with USC before and approached the school to discuss the possibility of a science and interactive media collaboration.
“NSF is worried about scientific illiteracy in the country,” said Elizabeth Daley, dean of SCA. “They want to find a way to better educate the public in fundamental scientific ideas, principles and research.”
CS2  will launch in fall 2010. It will not be a physical space on campus but rather a virtual environment run through SCA.
NSF has provided SCA with innovative resources, such as new devices and data visualization methods, to help the school achieve the goals of CS2.
The hope, Daley said, is that researchers nationwide will take advantage of CS2’s resources to make their research and findings accessible to the general population.
“If a researcher gets a major grant, they bring it to us to help them with their educational components,” Daley said. “The end result could be anything from a documentary to a game to a website.”
Cinematic arts students and faculty will have the opportunity to engage in various research projects and new forms of production through CS2. The opportunity to work with top researchers from multiple disciplines may also arise.
Students are excited by the opportunities the partnership will present.
“It sounds fantastic,” said Edwin Eversole, a junior majoring in cinema-television production. “I think cinematic arts students will be happy to be a part of this opportunity. The more information we help get out there, the better.”
Thomas Kalil, deputy director for policy for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a statement that the White House hopes this partnership will help merge the science and entertainment worlds.
“This novel and creative partnership will enlist the power of the entertainment media to inspire audiences to learn more about science and engineering, to develop a network of scientific experts, facilities and instruments available to the arts, and bring new technologies in sight, sound and video to the marketplace,” Kalil said in a press release.
As a federal agency, NSF is looking to promote President Obama’s “Educate to Innovate” campaign, which emphasizes the importance of excelling in the sciences.
NSF and USC first partnered  in 1996, when the two parties established the Integrated Media Systems Center, which has played a significant part in the expansion of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. Over the past decade, IMSC has developed an extensive cross-disciplinary program and has become the only NSF center of excellence in multimedia and the Internet.
Daley said the key to make CS2  work is to successfully incorporate the tools used to make quality media products to improve science education and information.

USC’s Middle East Studies Student Association is circulating a petition among students asking the university to improve the Middle Eastern language offerings at USC, hoping the petition will lead to major curriculum changes.
“USC is not really providing us with the resources we need to study what we want to study,” said Daphne Wu, president of MESSA and a senior majoring in history. “As of now, we only have four semesters of Arabic and Hebrew. With four semesters of Arabic, we hardly learn anything. It’s one of the hardest languages to learn.”
Currently, USC only offers three semesters of Modern Hebrew with one semester of Biblical Hebrew and four semesters of Modern Standard Arabic. The Arabic classes are all housed in the linguistics department.
The petition has collected a total of 243 signatures as of this week. As soon as the final signatures are collected, MESSA plans to deliver the letter to the Dean of USC College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, Howard Gillman; Vice Dean of Academic Programs Steven Lamy; and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs Richard Fliegel.
Wu said USC is in fact behind in its Middle Eastern languages curriculum compared to schools like New York University and the University of Chicago, which both offer numerous language and critical studies courses that deal with Middle Eastern culture.
“The textbook we use is for a three-year curriculum,” Wu said. “Here, in four semesters, we only finish one book [of three].”
Wu said the faculty in the Middle East Studies Program has been in talks with the deans for years trying to help the program grow.
Wu said this petition shows that students are interested in expanding the curriculum at USC and that the desire to develop Arabic course offerings is a concern that doesn’t just face the faculty.
The linguistics department did agree a few years ago to host the teaching of Arabic as a minor. James Higginbotham, chair of the Department of Linguistics, said this is an arrangement that he believes has worked out for the best.
“We have a superior [Arabic] teacher, and when odd sections have opened up, we have been able to employ one of our graduate students with an Arabic language position,” Higginbotham said.
Higginbotham added, however, that he believed the Arabic language professor would prefer to be employed under “a real department than to be shunted off to a Language Center.”
Dan Carino, advisor for Middle East studies, said student interest in the Middle East studies program has remained consistently strong.
“The lack of courses is the problem,” Carino said. “We have to hire more faculty to teach these courses, and with so few professors — some away, some on sabbatical, one on maternity leave — they’re hard to find.”
The MESSA petition is fighting for two main points: the strengthening of the Arabic language courses and an increase in Arabic courses beyond the elementary level and the addition of Persian and Turkish to the language offerings at USC.
Students who want to advance in their Arabic language studies often have to study abroad or spend time and money enrolling in other universities that offer more complete Arabic language programs. After studying outside of USC, they cannot continue their studies here since USC does not offer further courses in the study of Arabic or Hebrew.
“It’s a hassle for students who are serious about learning these languages,” Wu said.
Though the petition has garnered lots of support among students taking courses on Middle East studies, not many other students are aware of these issues.
“Most students don’t know the situation,” Wu said. “They’re not aware of the fact that we’re behind.”
In addition to Arabic, Farsi also be offered as it is at similary high quality private and public universities. Farsi is considered a critical language by the US State Department and the Los Angeles region has one of the largest populations of Iranians outside of Tehran. It is time for Farsi 1 and 2 at very least to be offered at USC.

A USC professor has been awarded a prestigious grant from the National Science Foundation to establish a center that will study microbes beneath the ocean floor.
College of Letters, Arts & Sciences Professor Katrina J. Edwards received a $25 million grant from the NSF to create the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI). NSF grants are extremely competitive — this year they were awarded to just five out of 247 proposed programs. Each grant allows for the creation of a new science and technology center.

C-DEBI, the center Edwards will establish with the grant money, will initiate sub-seafloor biosphere expeditions and research, and will develop education and outreach programs based on its findings. Although most of the work will be field work completed on a ship, the center will also run out of an office on campus.
“Marine research has been hobbling along for decades ever since we discovered, from core samples taken in the 1980s, that microbes existed within all marine sediment,” Edwards said. “This grant has come at a remarkably advantageous time, given the advances in research technology, and will over the next two years help shape the field of microbiology.”
The money from the grant will be spread between research endeavors — instrument purchase and upkeep, lab work, expeditions to take core samples — and the administrative costs of new education and outreach curriculums.
Edwards has been working to better organize and facilitate sub-seafloor research since her arrival at USC three and a half years ago.
Her proposal for the NSF grant began with a workshop supported by the Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies at USC, where she gathered a group of international biologists committed to pioneering a center similar to C-DEBI. A pre-proposal was drafted in October 2008, followed by a second proposal in April 2009. It was not long after NSF reviewers visited campus in October that USC officially received the grant for the center.
The center’s first initiatives will include three separate drilling junkets supported by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, to be completed over the next several years. Edwards herself will lead the team exploring the Atlantic Ocean’s North Pond, a location she has been studying since February 2009, with an expedition set to take place in September 2011.
An emerging scientific view holds that up to one-third of all biomass carbon might exist buried in marine sediment. The center, beginning with these expeditions, will examine what the presence of microbes beneath Earth’s surface means for the global carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle and the planet as a whole.
Through this grant, C-DEBI hopes to bring together a diverse group of biologists to explore the implications the deep sea biosphere holds for Earth’s systems. Edwards believes the funding will help scientists in the field better streamline their efforts.
The center’s other main initiative, to subsidize education and outreach programs, is set to begin this summer as part of C-DEBI’s broader aspirations to educate the public about its discoveries in geobiology.
Borrowing from the ideas of the Center of Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE), an NSF Science and Technology Center grant from 2006, C-DEBI is designing its outreach enterprises to be non-exclusive. C-MORE implemented outreach program “K To Gray,” referring to its pursuit of every age demographic.
“We are aiming these programs at everyone because we feel that the knowledge we will gain from this field of research is particularly transformative. We need everyone to be aware of it,” Edwards said.
Vice Dean Dani Byrd of the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences said USC is thrilled to have the center housed here and that the grant, much larger than those that normally come through the College, is a testament to Edwards’ leadership and her team’s commitment.
“It’s incredibly rare to see such a globally diverse group of scientists, all of whom are leaders in their fields, come together for such a coordinated effort,” Byrd said.
Edwards attributed much of the success to her colleagues, noting that she was proud of the effort they put forth in what she felt was a short period of time, and that she felt privileged to lead such a talented group of scientists.
“The support from within the university and from within the College has been incredible,” she said. “The faculty has been with us through every step in this process. Not many universities can capitalize on their own talents and resources at a level similar to USC’s.”
Outside of her work with C-DEBI, Edwards is a geobiologist, microbiologist and oceanographer, working with mineralogy on the side. She has been studying the deep sea her entire professional career and has been moving systematically toward deep biosphere research for the last six years.
Tremendous job by Professor Edwards – she’s to be congratulated – seems to me we know more about the surface of the moon than we know about life a foot below the surface of the ocean. Jim

For the first time at USC, textbook lists will be added to the fall schedule of classes to allow students to check the prices of the required texts before they register for a class.
“It provides students with very useful information and encourages faculty to submit their textbook requests early,” said Ken Servis, the dean of Academic Records and Registrar.
The addition of textbook information is the result of Section 133 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which requires all schools to publish textbook information in their course catalogues as of July 1.
“This new law that’s coming into play has brought a new awareness to the whole textbook industry,” said Daniel Archer, the director of USC Bookstores. “It has opened a conversation with the faculty and their use of course materials.”
The addition of book lists to the schedule of classes is intended to help students who want to keep their textbook costs down. USC’s California Public Interest Research Group, which has long advocated lowering textbook costs, supports the new law and has high hopes for its success.
“The list of prices is a really good idea so people can actually choose classes that are less expensive,” said Lisa Zhao, the vice chair and textbook campaign coordinator for CALPIRG. “If the students choose their classes based on the price, the professors might become more aware of the prices of the textbooks they assign.”
Some students, however, are not sure the law will have much of an effect.
“It might make a difference for which [general education courses] somebody might take,” said Samantha Klein, a junior majoring in fine arts. “But other than that, your schedule is pretty much determined by your major, and for those classes you do not have the option of not taking them because of high textbook costs.”
With the inclusion of textbook prices in the course list, professors are now required to submit their book lists earlier. This, Archer said, should help increase the success of textbook buyback, since the bookstore bases its buyback procedure on the books being used for the next semester. Archer also hopes requiring professors’ book lists earlier will increase the number of used books available.
Archer did note, however, that the new policy could mean more students will turn to other methods of getting textbooks.
“I believe we run the risk of possibly losing sales because students will be able to go out and shop, but more power to them. I don’t want any student to have to pay more than they have to,” said Archer. “But having the book lists earlier has allowed us more time to get the used books in, which is better for students.”
The earlier deadline for professors to submit their book list does not prohibit them from changing their minds on their textbook selections, Servis noted.
“It’s a live list, so if there is any change it can be changed,” said Servis.
Though progress is being made toward decreasing textbook costs, some feel like there is more that could be done.
“It’s definitely not enough,” Zhao said. “Even if people know about the prices they can avoid some classes, but for some  majors you cannot get around it.”
In its quest to provide alternatives to expensive textbooks, CALPIRG is orchestrating a large-scale book exchange program, Zhao said.
“You would put your books on a list, and then there would be an event hosted to buy books from the person instead of going to the bookstore,” she said.
Finally! I’d always get my books late when buying online because the book list wasn’t available early enough for me to buy and ship them on time. I’m looking forward to this change!
I don’t know about choosing classes based on the price of the book, though. You pay thousands for tuition- why go and cheap out on books to take a class you may not be as interested in? Getting the right books is part of the investment you make in your education.
Anyway, I’m appreciative of the new book list policy. Now all we need is to work on getting etextbooks…
