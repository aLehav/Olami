The USC men’s basketball team continued its winning streak on the road in Corvallis, beating the Oregon State Beavers 74-67 Saturday night.

After the Trojans defeated the Oregon Ducks on the road for the first time since 2009, they won their fourth-straight game over Oregon State and fourth-straight game in the Pac-12 thanks to four scorers in double-digits.
Troy started the game neck-and-neck with Oregon State, eventually pulling away via two straight 3-point buckets from senior guard Elijah Stewart to put USC up 12-7. 
Stewart, who has struggled this season to consistently hit shots, ended the game with a team-high 18 points off of four-of-eight shooting from 3-point range. 
Before scoring his highest total since a 20-point performance over Akron, Stewart started the Oregon trip by scoring a season-low 2 points, failing to hit all five of his field goals. 
After leading 12-7 at 15:30 in the first half, the Trojans scored just 8 points in the next eight minutes to lead the Beavers 20-16 before going on another run.
The Beavers’ offensive impotency came from their inability to hit the deep ball. Oregon State hit just two of their nine 3-point shots in the first half, ending the game by hitting at the exact same clip.
OSU kept things close with USC in the first half by drawing contact with the Trojan’s defense backcourt and hitting their subsequent foul shots. 
Trojans’ junior forward Chimezie Metu, redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron, sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic and sophomore guard Jonah Mathews each collected two personal fouls. 
USC sent Oregon State to the line six times in the first half and watched the Beavers score 9 of their final 11 points off of free throws, including four straight free throws from sophomore forward Tres Tinkle after a technical foul on Trojans’ head coach Andy Enfield and shooting foul on Rakocevic. 
While Tinkle was busy scoring 14 of OSU’s 33 first half points, the Men of Troy provided a more balanced offensive attack as six Trojans scored 4 or more points in the first half. 
Junior forward Bennie Boatwright, who missed all five of his 3-point attempts in the first half, managed to hit all of his 2-point shots and collect three assists, three rebounds and a steal. 
The final 20 minutes were a tale of two halves for USC.
The second half started off slow for the Trojans, but USC ultimately pulled away with 34 points in the final 12 minutes thanks to a huge second half from freshman guard Jordan Usher. 
The Trojans failed to hit nylon for seven and a half minutes after hitting an initial 2-point bucket to start the second half against the Beavers and their top-ranked scoring defense.
Buckets from Beavers senior forward Seth Berger, Tinkle and junior guard Stephen Thompson Jr. put Oregon State up 45-37 with 13:20 left in the half.
In response, USC took the next eight and a half minutes to enact revenge, scoring 30 points off of 77 percent shooting and holding OSU’s offense to just 11 points on a 38.4 percent clip. 
Despite missing both of his two shots in the first half, Usher exploded off the bench for four straight 3-pointers and 14 points in just 12 minutes of play. 
In contrast, Boatwright continued his first-half shooting woes and finished by missing a lone 3-pointer, while Metu followed up a 4-point first-half by missing all five of his second-half field goals. 
But, unlike Boatwright, Metu provided three key blocks, four rebounds and a perfect eight-for-eight from the free-throw line. 
Stewart and senior guard Jordan McLaughlin combined for six assists and 12 points off of 50 percent shooting from the field and made eight free throws. 
On the other side of the ball, Tinkle tallied 7 points in the second half to go along with six boards. Meanwhile freshman guard Ethan Thompson and Thompson Jr., who had similar first half performances, performed differently in the second half. 
Thompson Jr. hit just one of his three field goals in the first half and then six of his 12 in the second, leading the Beavers with 13 points. 
In comparison, Thompson played all 20 minutes in the second half and scored only one-of-six from the field for just 6 points. 
Ultimately, Oregon State’s inability to hit its deep shots, combined with USC’s shooting proficiency in the final 12 minutes, resulted in a big road win for the streaking Trojans.
With the momentum from their first Oregon school sweep and a four-game winning streak, Southern Cal welcomes Bay Area foes Stanford and Cal this Thursday and Sunday, respectively, to the Galen Center.

Over the weekend, USC football head coach Clay Helton filled two coaching vacancies. He named Bryan Ellis the team’s new quarterbacks coach, while former Trojan receiver Keary Colbert will oversee the tight ends and inside receivers. 
Ellis replaces Tyson Helton, Clay Helton’s younger brother who left USC in December to become the offensive coordinator and quarterback coach for the University of Tennessee.

Ellis, 29, enjoyed a successful career as a quarterback at the University of Alabama- Birmingham under the leadership of current USC offensive line coach Neil Callaway. Before joining USC as an offensive quality control assistant in 2017, Ellis was the wide receiver coach and passing game coordinator for Western Kentucky. 
The new quarterback coach received his first taste of the role at the Cotton Bowl. In that game, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold threw for 356 yards but struggled to hold onto the football. He threw an interception and fumbled twice in the 7-24 loss to Ohio State. 
One of Ellis’ first duties will be to help determine Darnold’s successor, following the starting quarterback’s decision to declare for the NFL Draft. Redshirt freshman Matt Fink, freshman Jack Sears and incoming five-star recruit J.T. Daniels are all expected to be contenders for the position. 
Colbert, like Ellis, also worked as an offensive quality control assistant at USC in 2017 and 2016. His previous coaching experience includes stints as an offensive analyst at Alabama from 2014-15, and as a wide receiver coach for Georgia State in 2013. 
A starter when as an undergraduate at USC from 2000 to 2003, Colbert enjoyed a tremendous college football career. He ranks seventh in USC school history receiving with 2,964 yards, after recording two consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in 2002 and 2003. 
Colbert was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He finished his professional career with 1,629 yards and eight touchdowns. 
“We are very excited to promote Bryan Ellis and Keary Colbert,” Helton said in a press release. “I have been extremely impressed with both individuals over their time here at USC. Their knowledge of the game, ability to develop relationships with our current players and talent to recruit top athletes will be a tremendous asset to our program. These are two young stars in our profession and we are proud that they are part of the Trojan Family.”

Facing two tough Pac-12 teams this past weekend, the women’s basketball team had to battle both to the bitter end. Clashing with Stanford on Friday and then quickly turning around to face No. 21 Cal on Sunday, the Trojans ultimately fell to both in the last two minutes of play.

“I thought it was a well-played offensive game,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “I am very happy with the effort of my team and very happy with Minyon’s effort tonight. We’re on the road right now, we’re 3 and 5 and we’ve got to figure out a way to get back to .500.”
Taking on Cal is certainly no easy task, especially when Cal’s starting center, junior Kristine Anigwe, is widely considered to be one of the best players in the country. Averaging 17.9 points and 8.8 rebounds a game, Anigwe is strong on the boards and at the 3-point range. Even with an impressive game of 20 points, the Trojans’ strong defense was able to keep her to only 3 points in the second quarter and two rebounds in the first half before she would foul out in the fourth quarter.
“We wanted to go inside,” Trakh explained. “I thought Kristen did a good job on her with the help Minyon went down and stole the ball a couple of times, but she is obviously a great player and that was big for us to stay in the game and getting her into foul trouble.”
The Trojans’ defense has been strong throughout the season, but stood out in their games this weekend even with the losses. 
With 19 steals and 13 blocks total from the weekend, the team kept its opponents on their toes. More impressive though is the fact that four of the Trojan starters ­— guards sophomore Minyon Moore, senior Sadie Edwards and junior Aliyah Mazyck, with forward senior Kristen Simon — played 78-80 minutes of two 40-minute games and were still able to fight until the very end.
“I think that since we don’t have a deep, deep bench, I think our starting five is doing a really good job,” Moore said. “And even though we are fatigued we are playing through it because we take it game by game and it’s not about yourself, we play for our team.”
Trakh shared his opinion on the Trojans’ strengths.
“We think we’re a defensive team,” Trakh said. “We wind up holding them to 62 points. I mean we really did a good job in the second half and they scored 27 points in the second half, so that is a pretty good defensive effort from us. We bring our defense all the time, bring it on the road, bring it home, but I think we’re doing a good job on the defensive end.”
With both games coming down to the wire, it was Mazyck and Moore who would stood for the Trojans. Mazyck continued to prove herself a force to be reckoned with on the court, after getting down early in the first quarter against Stanford. She went on to make three 3-pointers in a row, changing the lead and the momentum of the game to allow her team back into the fight. Then, on Sunday, Moore led the charge against Cal with 19 points, three steals and two blocks.
“Aliyah is having a great year and she is doing a great job for us so we’re really proud of the effort she is making, as I am of all the kids,” Trakh said.
Overall, the weekend may not have ended the way USC wanted but in both games, the team fought hard throughout and never backed down.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
Why do we dedicate our lives to sports? Is it the nail-biting, last-second comebacks? The Cinderella story, that any team on any given day can upset the No. 1 seed? I think it’s the wonder — the shared experience of watching a seemingly ordinary group of people achieve seemingly superhuman feats. I praise these accomplishments so much that I aspire to dedicate my life and career to following and attempting to make sense of the performance of sport from these gladiators in their respective battle arenas. 
Our society seems to have a very rigid definition of the term “sport” and is quick to belittle any activity that deviates from the strict definition. Typically, activities that include a team or individual competing against others in a match of physical exertion, skill and strategy are deemed  sports.
While we seem to have this thin line which separates a sport from an activity, that definition is constantly changing. 
Competitive video games, commonly referred to as esports, have proven themselves worthy of classification under the term “sports.” Yes, I just called video games a sport. Don’t write it off as insane just yet.
Not all video games are considered esports. For example, Super Mario Bros. — one of the greatest franchises of the last generation­­ — would not be labeled as an esport. This is because there is no competitive aspect to the game. To be classified as an esport, a video game usually has to be a multiplayer, skill-based and combative game. Similar to traditional sports, esports come in many varieties, but all reflect qualities of common sports. To illustrate some of the similarities, I will focus on one my personal favorite titles: Counter Strike : Global Offensive.
Counter Strike is a multiplayer, team-based, first-person shooter in which two teams of five players compete to win the best out of 30 rounds. In the game, the two opposing teams alternate sides in which one attempts to complete an objective while the other tries to prevent the objective from being completed. The team that succeeds in completing its respective objective is awarded the round. 
E-athletes have dedicated their lives to honing their skills in the virtual world. Teams regularly practice over 10 hours a day to improve their reflexes, in-game movements, strategies and team communication. 
Think of baseball, America’s pastime. Baseball, when stripped down to its basics, closely resembles Counter Strike. It has two opposing teams alternating turns in an attempt to score more runs than the other team. Ball players spend hours upon hours in the batting cage or on the diamond perfecting their reflexes, movement, strategies and team communication. Sound familiar?
Many people claim esports lack physical exertion and therefore should not be considered sports. This claim couldn’t be further from the truth. E-athletes exhibit intense physical exertion in the form of keystrokes and mouse movement. These actions are measured in actions per minute, and the best players can easily exceed 500 APM — a feat unattainable to the average gamer.
If my comparison hasn’t convinced you that esports are a legitimate sport, realize that some of today’s most popular sports were not initially percieved as sports, either.
Thirty years ago, the very idea of MMA was absurd. Who would want to watch two grown men in a steel cage,assault each other round after round? Well, apparently, a lot of people, since MMA has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry. A once trivial concept has turned into one of today’s largest entertainment spectacles. 
I firmly believe that esports are the next MMA, and I am not alone. The Philadelphia 76ers, New York Yankees’  legend Alex Rodriguez and former Los Angeles Lakers Shaquille O’Neal and Rick Fox have all invested in esports organizations. Newzoo — an organization which provides market intelligence covering the global games, esports and mobile markets — has projected that by 2020, esports will be a $1.5 billion market. 
A handful of universities are already taking advantage of the growing esports market and offering scholarships for e-athletes to play at the collegiate level. One of the few universities to offer a collegiate esports team, UC Irvine, has two competitive titles and its own arena. 
While USC does not have a collegiate-level team, we do have a club team. It should be up to the University’s athletics program to take a step into the modern world of sports and convert the established club into an esports team. With so few colleges currently offering a team, USC could become the first Pac-12 school to provide a home for some of the world’s greatest e-athletes.

Amid a modern music scene plagued with uniformity and mass production, EDEN is a breath of fresh air. With electronic and acoustic flourishes alike, and paired with his unparalleled ability to humanize new-age pop, EDEN’s debut LP vertigo honors the artist’s heartfelt and astute relationship with music. The album is slated to place this newcomer on the mainstream radar. 
EDEN establishes his place as an artist capable of fusing pop-EDM with themes of personal expression, especially true on songs like “gold” that combine electronic beats with soulful, earnest vocals. Photo courtesy of Astralwerks.
Still little known to the masses, Irish singer-songwriter Jonathan Ng began creating music as The Eden Project but, along with a shift in sonics, rebranded himself under the moniker EDEN in 2014. His first two EPs — 2015’s “End Credits” and 2016’s “i think you think too much of me” — presented him as a neo-electronic tour de force with a sound in a category of its own. Now, with his first full-length LP vertigo, EDEN solidifies his position as an innovator who has mastered the intersection of pop-EDM and personal artistic expression. 
The first track, “wrong,” is barely a minute in length and is void of any background instrumentation. Rather, EDEN’s unadulterated and distinctive voice opens the album as he wonders aloud, “I could be more / Isn’t there more?” establishing an introspective tone. The rest of the album follows suit, offering a lyrical journey of fresh contemplations as the opening song fades seamlessly into “take care.”
“lost//found” stands out as an acoustic ballad on which EDEN’s voice drips with emotion and, at times, fades away so completely that it is barely a breathy whisper. It is easy in these instances to imagine Ng singing into a microphone with his eyes closed, wholeheartedly immersed in his art form. The tendrils of his voice interweave effortlessly with soothing guitar strums to create a track that is refreshingly pure and undiluted by synthetic sound. 
Immediately after “lost//found” comes “crash,” a charged message of farewell to a bygone friend or lover. Just as his voice fades into a mourning, “How could you do this to me?” he launches into a powerful chorus completed by a forceful bass. Imbued with bittersweetness, “crash” is an honest portrait of a raw, emotional journey that lacks a conclusive or even positive ending — it is a journey that mirrors the reality and volatility of healing. 
With “gold,” EDEN’s profoundly individual connection to his music is evidenced in the organic sounds of shuffling and speaking into the microphone. Originally released as a single alongside “crash,” this track embodies EDEN at the peak of his musical prowess. He drops innovative, electronic beats but never loses his human touch through his soulful and saturated voice — a quality that is seldom found in artists deeply entrenched in the music industry today. 
Lamentful yet resolutely hopeful, “forever//over” represents EDEN’s willingness to experiment with sounds that range from the ethereal to the piercing and powerful. The track gradually becomes more upbeat and incorporates layers of more electronic sounds as his voice crescendos and swells in cadence with the artful instrumentation. Interestingly, the track concludes with a hushed, hardly-distinguishable conversational sequence between Ng and a female voice, replete with flirtatious chuckles and candid dialogue, which reinforces the blunt and unposed nature of his music. 
From start to finish, vertigo’s atmospheric soundscapes and organic sentiments offer a jarringly personal meditation on the tribulations of loss, love and maturation.

Den of Thieves interweaves the stories of a group of cops and criminals in the theft-ridden city of Los Angeles. The film follows the lives of its ensemble cast, focusing on lead character Nick Flanagan (Gerard Butler), a crooked cop on a mission to stop a group of elite criminals from continuing to wreak havoc on the city. The criminals include leader Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber), Levi Enson (50 Cent) and Donnie (O’Shea Jackson Jr.). 
Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
The film opens with an intense, gripping action sequence. Merrimen and company attempt to steal a van for a heist, ending up in the midst of a shootout with the LAPD. The action of this scene and those that follow are key aspects of the film’s success. Director Christian Gudegast’s meticulous direction remains crisp throughout the entirety of the film, especially within the heist scenes in the third act. These heart-pounding sequences demanded full attention from the audience.
 While the action, visuals and direction of Den of Thieves were noteworthy, the long-developed script could have benefited from further editing to ensure that each scene advanced the actual storyline. Much of the film is spent focusing on the familial lives of the lead characters, although very few of these scenes are relevant to the rest of the film. For instance, Nick is struggling through a divorce, while Levi helps his daughter prepare for prom. The scenes are a notable attempt to humanize the film’s characters, but they fall flat. Though the incorporation of the overall theme of family adds depth to the otherwise one-dimensional characters, the scenes felt out of place in the action-packed context of the overall film.
 With that being said, the cast did a good job given the unsatisfactory script. Butler does an outstanding job of individualizing his character, though he often succumbs to the clichés of the “crooked cop,” leather jacket-wearing badass. Similarly, Schreiber effectively convinces the audience of his capability as a criminal mastermind, though his motivations throughout the film are kept a mystery. 
Ultimately, O’Shea Jackson Jr. really carries the film.Jackson Jr. proved himself in his most substantial role yet; his character is often the bridge between the good cops and the criminals. The nuances of Jackson Jr.’s performance were a delight to watch throughout the film. His work in the heist scenes were especially noteworthy. Jackson Jr.’s facial expressions did much to elevate the tension of the moment and highlight his character’s nerves in the scene. 
Despite its successes, Den of Thieves does not provoke any new thoughts or break any new ground for the heist-thriller genre. The film feels like an amalgamation of Inside Man, The Dark Knight and The Usual Suspects, though it never reaches the heights of any of these films. What does make Den of Thieves stand out, however, is its morally ambiguous themes, wherein no character can be pigeon-holed as good or evil. While at times some of the plot developments seem unrealistic, they work within the gritty world of the film. The blurred lines between good or evil, like Nick’s “bad-cop” way of solving crime and Merrimen’s past history as a marine, make the film all the more interesting.
While the characterization, script and occasionally uneven tone burdened an otherwise great film, Den of Thieves is gripping enough in its most exciting moments to be worth watching.

“Why do you want to be a music writer?”
Art by Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
It’s a simple question — one I normally wouldn’t mind being asked and would love to talk about, unless the question was raised by my father. To a Lt. Colonel in the Army who built a career in the relatively lucrative field of engineering, the prospect of his son diving headfirst into an industry with bleak job prospects and an even bleaker salary outlook made little sense, especially since I’d excelled at math as a kid. Personalities such as Stephen A. Smith and Rich Eisen gave him a glimmer of hope when the dream was sports journalism, but as my priorities shifted from the gridiron to the grooves, successful examples he could refer to were virtually nonexistent in his eyes.
So when he posed the dreaded question once again near the end of 2017 on a long, two-hour drive from Thomasville to Cary, N.C., I wearily gave my rote answer that it was my passion and fit the type of career I was searching for. The mood was already gloomy, as we were in Thomasville to visit my grandmother, who was in declining condition and had just been moved to a nursing home.
We had both grown tired of his limited song library after spending too many hours in the car, and as we drove to Cary to exchange a North Carolina A&T (his alma mater) sweatshirt for one of a different size, he decided to hand me the aux cord for a breath of fresh air. Knowing his tastes in music, I mainly stuck to songs within the realm of funk and R&B, and tried to keep the number of grimaces at aggressive rap lyrics to a minimum.
Several songs in, however, the conversation began to take an unexpected turn. Instead of trying to nudge me toward an education in computer science, he started asking questions about the music, how I found the songs and what drew me to them. Instead of curtly repeating that covering the world of music was what I wanted to do with my life, I taught him about the art of sampling and showed how the technique kept previous generations of music alive, using the music of Anderson .Paak, one of my inspirations for pursuing the profession, as an example. 
Soon, I learned another reason he didn’t want me to go into the music industry: Not only did he see it as less profitable, but he believed it was a dying art form. He didn’t hear any new, emerging talent carrying on the sounds he grew up with in the ’70s and ’80s, but only abrasive hip-hop that lacked the essence of what he thought music should sound like. 
Jumping at the chance to prove him wrong, I pointed to many of my favorite artists from today who were creating music that harkened back to the styles of his childhood. Juxtaposing Chicago rapper Noname with legendary spoken word artist Gil Scott-Heron, and queueing songs from Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” next to tracks from Virgin Ubiquity II by Roy Ayers, I saw his face light up as he relived memories with the song “I Am Your Mind.”
Money was often tight around the house when my father was growing up — a fact I’ve known for years. However, I hadn’t realized how much it had affected his mentality as he grew older and went off to school. Like me, he’d held a passion for music when he was growing up; he’d drummed on tables just as I did and watched one of his friends try his luck in a band. However, his number one priority was earning a reliable income, as he refused to spend his life worrying about how the bills were going to be paid. He’s enjoyed his career as an engineer but still regretted not chasing his dreams, something I refused to do in part because I was fortunate enough to grow up in a better financial situation than he did.
After listening to my music and my words for nearly four hours, however, he finally understood why I was so hellbent on charting my own career path. He admitted he didn’t know as much about my business as he knew about his own, but he trusted my knowledge and ability to make the right decisions, essentially giving me his blessing to pursue journalism for the first time.
Now, with that out of the way …
Welcome to the first edition of “To Pen a Butterfly,” a weekly column where I’ll be sharing personal stories and opinions on the music industry! Expect plenty of new artist recommendations, random anecdotes and never a bad word about legendary hip-hop rhyme savior Kendrick Lamar. Let’s get to it.
Why I’m smiling: November by SiR
On November, SiR’s breezy voice above light, warm production for an album that sees the soulful crooner realizing the potential he showed on previous records Her Too and Seven Sundays. Photo courtesy of TDE.
Signed to Los Angeles-based record label TDE in January of 2017, SiR made waves as a name to watch in R&B, with his light, airy vocals creating tender moods on Her Too and Seven Sundays. He fulfills that potential on his new album November, combining neo-soul with silky grooves that ooze with Southern California sunshine. SiR wrestles with love in his lyrics, describing his relationships and lamenting missed opportunities on a cohesive album that’s just as impressive when played straight through as it is when split off into playlists.
Why I’m shaking my head: Yams Day 2018
The new year is finally here, and there’s still no place for violence at a concert, much less at a charity show dedicated to the memory of the Mob’s founding member, A$AP Yams. The night was cut short after a brawl broke out during A$AP Rocky’s performance, with rumors of gunshots and speculation that rapper 6ix9ine was involved in the melee. Police have since reported that no shots were fired in the venue; hopefully, the incident won’t impact the annual festival’s future.
Why I’m hopeful for the future: Culture II
T H A T  W A Y. Quavo’s and Offset’s respective collaboration albums each carried a few gems, but overall didn’t quite live up to lofty expectations. This Saturday marks exactly 365 days since Migos gave the world Culture and subsequently stormed through 2017, and the Friday preceding the anniversary will see the release of the acclaimed album’s follow-up, Culture II. Expect to see another star-studded tracklist, and to hear the trio’s signature flow all year once again.

An advertisement released last month by the D.C. Health and Wellness Center has been met with strong criticism. The commercial promotes the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a preventative drug that reduces the risk of H.I.V. by nearly 90 percent. Its depictions of a range of humorously suggestive clips — including a woman licking ice cream and a champagne bottle erupting in slow-motion — have led many to dismiss the content as distasteful, taking to social media platforms like Twitter to voice their opinions on the controversial advertisement.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
While this advertisement may appear unnecessarily lewd at first glance, it advances a worthy cause: the fight against H.I.V. Perhaps the outcry against this obviously well-meaning commercial is indicative of an entirely different cultural epidemic altogether — a society that is on the outs with its own behavior, not yet ready to openly discuss sex and, specifically, now that sexually transmitted diseases can be prevented. In particular, we struggle to talk about the issue of sexual health and the LGBTQ community.
If any changes are to occur, whether that be combating H.I.V. or eliminating cultural taboos that limit our conversations about sex and sexual health, then these conversations must first be able to comfortably take place in the public realm. 
With the advent of contraceptives, improved screening technologies and H.I.V.-prevention methods like PrEP, enduring struggles with H.I.V. and other sexually-transmitted diseases are rarely discussed these days. When it comes to H.I.V. and S.T.I.s, individuals often apply a sense of otherness: They believe these problems belong to everyone but them. They hold a conviction that they are somehow immune to these diseases and infections. 
That rates of H.I.V.-infected individuals are presently declining does not signal the end of the H.I.V. crisis in America.
Of the 1.2 million Americans living with H.I.V. and AIDS, only about 145,000 actually have active prescriptions to PrEP. Most striking, perhaps, is the fact that gay and bisexual males constitute the populations that are both most affected by H.I.V. and least likely to obtain PrEP or other preventative drugs and treatments. 
This is especially true for gay and bisexual men in college. Recent national surveys of sexually active college students showed that only about 13 percent of gay men and 9 percent of bisexual men were informed of PrEP by their campus clinics’ physicians. To withhold such information, then, is to deny students opportunities to safeguard their own sexual health.
Campus health clinicians should be obligated — if not professionally then ethically — to inform their patients about the resources that are available to them, especially if their patients are gay or bisexual men who are therefore most susceptible to H.I.V.
However, even when gay and bisexual male college students seek out PrEP and other precautionary measures on their own, they still face an uphill battle. Given the general stereotype characterizing the LGBTQ community as sexually promiscuous, clinicians may let their preconceptions hinder their abilities to offer objective health insights and advice to their patients.
There are certainly misplaced ethics behind what motivates health care workers to provide PrEP to some college students but not others. When the shaming of gay and bisexual male students is compounded by the hefty price of PrEP, one truth seems strikingly clear: Adequate H.I.V. treatment is primarily reserved for those who are wealthy, and more likely to be straight.
That being said, no one, regardless of their class, sexuality or membership in any other socially-constructed group, can absent themselves from the possibility of contracting H.I.V. or other diseases. This very egalitarian nature of disease should be mirrored in the ways in which colleges provide PrEP: with equal access. This is the only solution that can begin to eradicate the plague of H.I.V. in America. 
If society is at all to tackle the issue of inaccessibility to PrEP, then it must first be able to comfortably discuss the topics of H.I.V. and sex. 
Rather than shame the behaviors of their LGBTQ patients, health care professionals must instead foster conversations centered around information and objective fact. They need to acknowledge the reality that sex does, in fact, occur, and provide their patients with the knowledge and resources to make safe and smart decisions. The moral judgement of patients is under interrogation when the focus should be on the issue at hand: H.I.V. and its prevention. Surely, this is an issue that will require honest speakers and, just as importantly, mindful listeners. 
As was said in San Francisco when i lived there in the 80’s:  If you want to stop the spread of HIV simply sit down and shut your mouth.
Not only HIV, herpes is another care that we should put it into sexual health education.  – MPWH Community

Ryan Fawwaz | Daily Trojan
Last Tuesday, Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski was found dead in his off-campus apartment. Next to the 21-year-old’s body were a rifle and a suicide note. 
No matter the age, no matter the socioeconomic status, there is no group unaffected by suicide, and it’s a tragedy every time. But the rising college football star’s story is particularly attention-grabbing. 
Not that the instance should come as too much of a surprise: College athletes are facing a serious mental health crisis. Now more than ever, sports teams must be able to look past the power rankings or stats of their star players. Now more than ever, sports teams must be able to look past stigmas associated with mental illness. 
Surely this goes without saying, but being a college student poses enough challenges as it is. Moving away from home, forming new social circles and deciding on a potential career path all weigh heavily on a person’s emotional well-being ; add on the pressures of pleasing coaches, fans and recruiters, and dire mental health struggles are almost to be expected. 
Much of the problem lies in the fact that athletes, above others, are expected to prioritize physical strength over mental strength; on the football field or on the basketball court, it’s matter over mind. In a highly competitive league, students — many on scholarships — cannot miss a beat. Mental illnesses are not as tangible as shot percentages or muscle mass, so little attention is paid.
According to the University of Michigan School of Public Health, 33 percent of all college students show “significant” signs of mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. Of those, 30 percent seek help. For student athletes, the number is drastically lower: a staggering 10 percent. 
To make the problem worse, the 10 percent brave enough to voice their health issues have a hard time finding an ear to listen. Many struggling athletes don’t even have a mental health professional within their departments. According to a May/June 2017 journal published by Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach, only 20.5 percent of surveyed athletic trainers reported that they had a mental health provider for students in the training room. As a result, many students are forced to travel off campus, and at times travel considerable distances, to find support. Put simply, this is a serious blow to one’s courage, and such apathy cannot be tolerated any longer. 
In this regard, universities like Oregon State are making commendable efforts to turn concerned dialogue into action. For instance, OSU recently began the #DamWorthIt campaign, which aims to place mental health needs into the forefront of university discussion surrounding athletics. The movement also calls attention to the university’s existing services for athletes, such as its nationally recognized Counseling and Psychological services staff. In the future, similarly sports-centric universities must follow suit and exercise this level of introspection and dedication to their own athletes. 
Having played competitive ice hockey for most of my life, I can understand why it may be intimidating to speak with a coach about such heavy personal issues. Don’t get me wrong — I was far from being Division 1-bound, and the only fan I needed to impress was my mother. That said, at any competition level, players must grapple with the feeling that they always need to please their coaches. Personally, I never felt comfortable telling my coach — the person who constantly picked apart my drill run-throughs in practice and sat me on the bench whenever I made a bad play — that I struggled with anxiety on the ice. Considering the situation at an elite playing level, taboos like that are unspeakable. 
That toxic mentality is beginning to change, though — even if it is at a snail’s pace. After Hilinski’s death, former Washington State quarterback Drew Bledsoe posted a picture of Hilinski with the caption: “Reaching out for help when we need it is NOT a sign of weakness. Trusting your friends and asking for help is the ultimate sign of STRENGTH!! If we sprain an ankle we go see a doctor. If we’re struggling emotionally we have to learn to treat it the same way.” While the reality behind the sentiment is undeniably heartbreaking, the tone of the message reflects an uplifting movement toward progress: The sports world is beginning to realize the need to talk about these issues, rather than push them under the rug. 
In its entirety, the recent mental health crisis in collegiate athletics should be regarded as nothing less than an epidemic. If we truly want athletes to receive the help they need, we must stop placing them on a pedestal above their human capabilities. Even the shiniest gold medals can weigh a person down if they’re heavy enough. In those cases, supporters can’t just cheer from the sidelines — they need to step in and support players through their struggles with advocacy for reform. Athletes’ lives might just depend on it.

In the name of “athlete mental equality” admit only those athletes who meet the same academic entrance standards as all aspiring, non-athlete USC admissions candidates.  Why should they be granted admission simply because they bounce a ball better or run faster than others?

The latest results from the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times public opinion poll, released on Friday, predict that Republicans will lose the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018.
From Dec. 15 to Jan. 15, nearly 4,000 registered voters selected by USC’s Understanding America Study internet panel took online surveys. 
The poll, designed to predict voter attitudes, is the first in a nationwide series leading up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections. 
The results paint a bleak picture for Republicans. According to the poll, Trump’s approval rating is 32 percent — slightly lower than in most polls, which place him in the high 30s, but still problematic for the GOP.
According to Director of the USC Unruh Institute of Politics Bob Shrum, Trump’s low favorability suggests Democrats could overtake Republicans in the midterm election. 
“If the elections were held now, Democrats would very likely capture the House,” Shrum said in a USC News release. “And if President Donald Trump’s favorability ratings don’t improve, history shows that’s what we can expect to happen in November.”
The historical precedent for midterm elections after a president’s first year in office support Shrum’s prediction. Senior editor at Gallup News Jeffrey Jones believes that a low favorability rating like Trump’s would correlate with a 36-seat swing. 
“Since 1946, when presidents are above 50 percent approval, their party loses an average of 14 seats in the U.S. House in the midterm elections, compared with an average loss of 36 seats when presidents are below that mark,” Jones said in a Gallup News article. 
Given Trump’s approval rating, Republicans are predicted to lose around 36 seats. Democrats only need 24 to flip the House.
Additionally, 51 percent of responders say that they would vote for a Democratic congressional candidate, as opposed to 40 percent for a Republican. 
More than 30 Republican congressmen have announced they won’t be running for reelection in November, making Democrats the heavily favored party.
This could be an indication that voters are “ready to potentially punish the president,” Republican strategist Mike Murphy said to the Los Angeles Times.
The poll also addressed 2020 presidential candidate favorites, whether women are still disadvantaged and the prevalence of racial discrimination. 
Results demonstrated that of the 10 proposed Democratic candidates, former vice president Joe Biden was the favorite. They also indicated that voters are ready for something different from previous candidates, such as Hillary Clinton.
“Democrats have closed the Clinton chapter,” Shrum said. “People want to move on. I also think that when you look at the numbers, there’s an opening for someone new, not because they receive big numbers, but because no one is dominant in the poll.”
Additionally, 60 percent of respondents agreed that obstacles remain for women’s rights.
 Similarly, the majority of people recognized racial discrimination, but by a smaller margin. 
According to the poll, 54 percent said “people not seeing discrimination where it really does exist” is more problematic than people seeing it “where it really does not exist,” when asked to choose between the two in the survey.
According to Shrum, that number is unsatisfactory. He believes the issue of racial discrimination is obvious and that the problem lies in America accepting its own faults. 
“There’s always been this reluctance of the country to recognize a problem,” Shrum told USC News. “[This poll] tells you that a majority of the country, by an eight point margin, understands that there is still discrimination and it does hold people back.”

Three researchers from the USC Keck School of Medicine were among a group of medical institutions awarded a total of $70 million over the next five years by the National Institutes of Health to develop new infrastructure targeting Alzheimer’s disease research.

Two Harvard-affiliated hospitals in Boston and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota were also included in the award.
This infrastructure — the Alzheimer’s Clinical Trial Consortium — is a collaboration expected to make great strides in researching Alzheimer’s disease, which is currently the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. 
The researchers hope to improve efficiency for patient recruitment in clinical trials and technology that would assist with sharing data, instruments and blood and tissue samples. 
“A new therapy for Alzheimer’s disease has not been approved in the past 14 years, and none of the approved therapies actually change the course of the disease,” Keck professor Paul Aisen told USC News. “This collaboration will remove some of the barriers that have hamstrung researchers from timely completion of clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.”
The infrastructure will be built at the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the USC Health Sciences Campus in San Diego, but the team hopes to expand to sites across the country with help from the grant.
Aisen, who is also the director of Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute, has been a leading figure in the field of Alzheimer’s disease research for more than two decades. He says that ACTC is a team of seasoned researchers who are focused on the stage of therapeutic testing, or “clinical trials.”
“In our efforts, we’ve learned a great deal about the disease and about potential targets and potential therapies,” Aizen said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But all of our large studies have failed … and we believe we understand [why] now … We’ve been focused on treating Alzheimer’s dementia, which is what everybody thinks about when they hear Alzheimer’s but what we have learned as academic investigators is … that Alzheimer’s disease is a much longer disease than just the dementia stage.”
The race to find a cure for Alzheimer’s disease is becoming more urgent, Aisen said. Without immediate intervention, it is expected that the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s will jump from 5.5 million this year to 13.5 million by 2050. With new infrastructure, researchers hope to discover more effective interventions to help treat and prevent the disease.
“Almost all of us have this disease in our families,” Aisen said. “It was my interest in having an impact on health care, problem of an aging population and seeing Alzheimer’s disease in my own family all came together to to interest me in this field.”

The theme of the march was “Hear Our Vote,” focusing attention on the midterm elections this November. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
An estimated 200,000 demonstrators flooded Pershing Square for the second Women’s March on Saturday, holding posters calling for women’s rights, disparaging the policies of President Donald Trump and encouraging participants to vote in the Nov. 6 midterm election this year. 
While there was a handful of Trump supporters staging an anti-protest, holding signs that read “Make America Great Again” and “Beautiful Women Love Trump,” Women’s March volunteers formed a chain around the anti-protesters and dozens of Los Angeles Police Department officers stood guard. The march remained a peaceful demonstration and police reported no arrests or major incidents. 
While last year’s inaugural march — which drew an estimated 750,000 people — centered on the theme “Hear Our Voice,” this year, the focus shifted to “Hear Our Vote.” Thousands of attendees publicized the hashtag #powertothepolls over social media.
Demonstrators marched from Pershing Square to Los Angeles City Hall at 10 a.m, where a number of celebrities gave speeches to the crowds, including actresses Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman, Eva Longoria, Olivia Wilde and Viola Davis, who each urged the crowds to keep the momentum of the march going by voting at the midterm elections. 
Some demonstrators found Davis’ speech to be the most impactful. As a sexual assault survivor herself, Davis spoke out about the strength of those who have endured the same experiences she did, encouraging them to use that strength to enact change through voting. 
“I am always introduced as an award-winning actor, but my testimony is one of poverty,” Davis said in her speech. “My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me, and I know that every single day when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that’s what drives me to the voting booth.”
Davis also spoke about the victims of sex trafficking and how women of color are disproportionately affected by it. According to Davis, 70 percent of victims of sex trafficking are girls of color. She spoke about standing up for the women who could not come forward. 
“I am speaking today, not just for the #MeToo’s, because I was a #MeToo, but when I raise my hand, I am aware of all the women who are still in silence,” Davis said. “The women who are faceless, the women who don’t have the money … and who don’t have the images in our media that gives them a sense of self-worth enough to break their silence that’s rooted in the shame of assault.”
Vice President of Internal Affairs for the Trojan Advocates for Political Progress Jacob Lind, said that Davis’ speech merged the #MeToo movement with the Women’s March. 
“Her ability to connect things like the #MeToo movement, things almost apolitical in nature, to the political action that was the Women’s March itself … was pretty impressive,” Lind said. “It was emotionally powerful and emotionally resonant as well as being a well put together speech about a very pressing issue.”
Danielle Rucker, another demonstrator at the march, pointed out that the fight for equality is particularly challenging for women of color like herself. 
“I’m out here to support fellow women and just make sure that people are understanding the rights that women have, because we do deserve equality in all aspects of our lives,” Rucker said. “I’m a woman [and] I’m black, so I’m a minority in two areas of my life.”
James Lambert Otis, a West Hollywood resident who previously made headlines in October 2016 for taking a sledgehammer to Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, also marched in recognition of this inequality. Sporting a “Black Lives Matter” shirt, Otis marched in opposition of sexual assault and for Trump’s impeachment.
At the march, Otis acknowledged acts of civil disobedience and marching as effective ways to create change and to demonstrate support. 
“I think [marching is] one of the greatest nonviolent means to affect change,” Otis said. “So this is showing the whole world, on the day that the government shutdown, there’s a strong majority of women and men who are against Trump, all of his policies, but especially against his hatred against women and his policies against people of color.”
Nobody cares about what these painted Hollywood dolls say or do.

To David Florence, director of consulting firm Stanton Chase International and chairman of the USC Marshall Center for Global Innovation, there is no better place to hold a conference exploring the depths of innovation than in Southern California.

The Center for Global Innovation held its third annual Innovation Coast Conference on Friday at the Doubletree hotel in Culver City. 
“The beaches, the mountains, the quality of life and the schools [here] are phenomenal,” Florence said. “All of this is part of my vision for making Los Angeles the hub of innovation of the globe.”
This vision was created by Marshall School of Business professor Gerard Tellis, director of the Marshall Center for Global Innovation, who launched this conference three years ago.
In attendance were innovators and entrepreneurs in business, technology, science and entertainment. It aimed to connect students and professionals in a full-day, interactive network.
The day started off with a breakfast buffet and introductions from Florence, as well as a presentation on the growing need for and importance of innovation. The panels then kicked off promptly at 9 a.m., and broke into four different tracks: “Heart and Money,” “Corporate Innovation,” “Joining to Innovate” and “Science Fiction or Reality?”
As part of the “Joining to Innovate” track, the “Upstarts – Millennial Innovators” panel featured seven entrepreneurs and businessmen. The audience asked questions on what employers can do to adjust to millennial demands, as well as how to bridge a growing generational gap. Marshall alumnus Dillon Morgan, who is the founder and CEO of Unum, offered advice to older employers at the panel.
“Because millennials can probably navigate the digital landscape better than most people, if something kind of feels like an obstacle … sometimes they think they can do things faster,” Morgan said.
Other panels that morning ranged from “The Entertainment Disruptors,” which featured TiVo CEO Enrique Rodriguez, to “Fung Shui – Workplace Innovation,” which focused on improving workplaces to foster creativity and productivity. 
Lunch was served before Chief Digital Officer and Executive Vice President of Warner Bros. Entertainment Thomas Gewecke gave the event’s keynote address. In his speech, Gewecke emphasized the close relationship that Warner Bros. has had with USC and its alumni.
This was followed by several other panels, including ones focused on topics like Blockchain, crowdfunding and health and wellness through innovation.
“It’s important for [students] to realize that the path to wealth and success is innovation,” Tellis said. “You can’t just say ‘I’m going to be an employee.’ Things are moving so fast that you have to be innovative and you not only have to react to the changes, but you have to be the creator of change.”
