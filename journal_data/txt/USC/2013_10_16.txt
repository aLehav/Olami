South Los Angeles residents and staff members from the South Coast Air Quality Management District met in a town hall meeting Wednesday night to discuss recent complaints over odors from the AllenCo oil well in the University Park neighborhood.
Odor in LA · South Coast Air Quality Management District Executive Officer Barry R. Wallerstein discusses the recent odor issues on Wednesday. – Juliette Pisani | Daily Trojan
 
Residents have been complaining for the past three years about odors coming from the site and attribute some acute health problems to those odors. Since 2010, the SCAQMD received about 340 odor complaints and 16 Notices of Violation were issued. The SCAQMD began taking air samples in 2011 by using both a mobile trailer and what they described as “instantaneous samples.”
The district is taking long-term samples in addition to the samples collected by portable instruments that basically suck in the air around them. The results showed elevated levels of light hydrocarbons in one air sampling as well as high levels of total hydrocarbons in the AllenCo property’s wastewater, water that would not affect the community. None of the results, however, revealed toxic levels of any compounds. The SCAQMD Assistant Deputy Executive Officer for Science and Technology Advancement Philip Fine said the levels they found could explain the smells around the site, but that nothing was found in toxic levels.
Even with these results, community members still expressed their belief that something is seriously wrong in the area, something they believe can be linked to the odors coming from the AllenCo site.
Sandra Matamores Barrios described an incident in which her daughter stopped breathing from what the doctors later told her was an environmental cause. Two years ago, Barrios’ daughter woke up early in the morning and told her mother that she could not breathe and had pain in her heart and chest. Her daughter was able to breathe again when Barrios performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
“At that point I felt a horrible odor, and it felt like a chemical odor, like it had exploded,” Barrios said through an English translator. “It smelled like burnt gasoline and so I was saying to myself, ‘Something must be happening at that company across the way.’”
Barrios said the odor was even stronger outside, and her daughter had to be hooked up to a respirator when the family arrived at the hospital. Her daughter has had asthma since then, and Barrios said the doctor told her the asthma was due to the environment in which they lived.
Barrios has lived in the area for about 10 years and said her daughter was always healthy. Nancy Ibrahim of Esperanza Community Housing Corporation, an organization that helps provide affordable housing, said that residents have complained to her about acute health symptoms such as asthma that did not exist before, nosebleeds and severe headaches. She also expressed worry for students who live in the area because they may not be able to afford more expensive housing elsewhere in the city.
“People are getting sick. Children are getting sick. My colleagues are getting sick. I am getting sick,” Ibraham said. “People are reporting that if they go away for vacation or leave the area, they feel better. They have these beautiful apartments to go home to that they can’t live in.”
Moving forward, SCAQMD will continue monitoring the air for at least another month. A second town hall meeting will be held in early December.

The university is taking time  this month to focus on the Cyrus Cylinder, which is being exhibited for the first time in the United States at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif. until Dec. 2.
The cylinder is often called the first declaration of human rights. It is an account of Persian King Cyrus’ conquest of Babylon, inscribed in Babylonian cuneiform.
The USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism will hosted a panel on the Cyrus Cylinder on Oct. 30. It will focus on artifacts and institutions that have begun global dialogues.
On Oct. 13, the USC Middle East Studies Program and the Farhang Foundation, an Iranian cultural group, held a lecture in the Tutor Campus Center Grand Ballroom examining the significance of the 2,600-year-old artifact.
Unlike the Annenberg panel, which will focus on the global impact of the cylinder, panelists at this event mainly discussed the cylinder’s relevance in Iranian culture.
Speakers at the event included Elizabeth Carter, a professor at UCLA; Ryan Byrne, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin; Bruce Zuckerman, a professor in religion at USC and an expert in near Eastern texts and Tamara Eskenazi, a professor at Hebrew Union College.
Part of the significance of the cylinder is that it includes information on Cyrus’ policy of repatriation towards the Jewish peoples. Eskenazi spoke about Cyrus’ actions impact on Jewish culture.
“Instead of vanishing from history, the people of Judah returned and they rebuilt. They not only survived, they soon flourished,” Eskenazi said. “In the process, they created the one of the most influential books ever, the [Hebrew] Bible. None of this would have been possible without the help of King Cyrus.”
Others speakers discussed more recent developments concerning Iran. Byrne suggested that studying the Middle East, an area of increasing political importance, leads to an understanding of what issues shape the region’s politics today.
“I think the Cylinder is a reminder that our intellectual heritage and diplomacy are always tied up together,” he said. “We only remember our past as well as we can remain peaceful enough not to destroy objects that are the conservators of those memories.”
Zuckerman, a professor in religion at USC spoke about USC’s pioneering use of imaging technology, to better view objects like the Cyrus Cylinder at the event.
“The great frustration is ‘I want the light, I want to look at this over here.’ This hands the people who need to study these things very powerful tools of the type they’ve never had before,” Zuckerman said. “It’s a real revolution, and I’m glad to say we are USC are at the cutting edges.”
Zuckerman said that more than 44 institutions make use of InscriptiFact technology, developed at USC, in order to better document artifacts. InscriptiFact is a project that allows people to access high-resolution images of ancient inscriptions through the Internet. Zuckerman is one of the experts behind the database of images.
The event also highlighted the Middle East studies program and its Iranian studies initiative.
Dornsife officially inaugurated the initiative two years ago when it began offering Persian language classes with the financial support of the Farhang Foundation. In offering Iranian studies, USC joins the ranks of schools such as Stanford, UCLA, New York University and Columbia University.
The minor is the second phase of a three-part plan from the Middle East studies program  to eventually create an Iranian studies major.
Part of the reasoning behind the program is that USC is located in Los Angeles, home to the largest Iranian community outside of Iran.
“I believe it’s crucial for the community, for our American friends, to see us in a brighter light that is a bit different from the negative portrayal in the mass media,” Haleh Emrani, chair of the Iranian Studies Council at the Farhang Foundation, said. “To be able to do that, we should rely on education. With that we need to promote Iranian studies to provide an environment for young people to be exposed to the positive side of Iranian culture.”
Those interested in learning more about the Cyrus Cylinder can attend Annenberg’s event “Rediscovering the Cyrus Cylinder: The Making of a Cultural Icon with Timothy Potts,” Oct. 30 at noon in the Geoffrey Cowan Forum.

Retired U.S. General and CIA director David Petraeus began his tenure as the Judge Widney professor last week.
The title distinguishes esteemed individuals in a particular field. Petraeus earned a Ph.D. in international relations from Princeton University, but at USC, he will be working with many different schools and programs. His involvement will range from programs for veterans to energy use and the economy.
The beginning · General David Petraeus lectured for the first time as part of USC’s faculty, centering on energy and the U.S. economy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Petraeus guest lectured for the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study last week, when he discussed the revolutions in energy, information technology and manufacturing, and how these changes could possibly boost the U.S. economy.
USC has 875 veterans currently enrolled and 120 more students are part of Price School of Public Policy’s ROTC program. Petraeus is also the faculty adviser for the USC Veterans Association. He began his tenure by speaking with researchers from the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans & Military Families. Through cooperation with the Institute for Creative Technologies, the center has developed a virtual human avatar, which will allow the School of Social Work to study the needs of veterans and their families.
As part of his first official week as a professor at USC, Petraeus also opened a national conference for the Price School of Public Policy concerning veterans’ transition from war to home and lectured for the Marshall School of Business to the first class of students in the Master of Business for Veterans program.
Petraeus said his decision to join the faculty of USC was influenced by his belief in USC’s rising potential and by the school’s attention to the service sector.
“USC is in the middle of a surge,” Petraeus told USC News. “USC has a great faculty, great students and the weather’s fantastic. It’s hard to beat.”
Is there going to be an online course?
Dear Fellow Trojans,
Yes, Gen Petraeus misbehaved. Still, he is a brilliant man, one with astonishing experience in the military and the CIA and one who knows far more about politics and international affairs than our instructors who have never had those experiences. He is a jewel to have at USC, even if he did have that embarrassing, scandalous affair. Please don’t let any jerks in class heckle him or show disrespect. Ask plenty of questions, though. You will be amazed at his insights and his shrewd understanding. He is one of the top minds the US military ever had.

Formerly just a residential program, student recovery community The Haven will expand per university request with the opening of The Haven Center in the Office of Religious Life this month.
The community provides support for students seeking help with substance abuse issues. The Haven offers group or individual sessions with USC alum and Program Director Nick Techentin, as well as peer support and events created by fellow students in recovery.
University professors, administrators, parents and alumni will join in providing services and treatment for substance abuse where The Haven residential community is located in University Gateway. The Haven will establish a physical base on campus for the tight-knit community that lives in The Haven, as well as its external community of students seeking substance abuse support.
Nearly one out of five young adults ages 18 to 25 suffers from a substance abuse problem. In response to the Office of National Drug Control Policy’s call to expand recovery support services on college campuses, the nation has seen rapid growth in collegiate recovery communities. USC is establishing itself as a leader in this movement, providing both residential and extended services for students through The Haven and The Haven Center.
“We began last year with very few people and a couple of allies at USC who were interested in helping create this,” co-founder Holly Sherman said. “We are now reaching out to the greater USC student community, even people who are just starting to look at their drug use [and] alcohol use, and thinking that maybe they’re overdoing it a little.”
Sherman and fellow co-founder Sharon Weber run The Haven with their team of collaborators, known as Recovery Grads.
In a college setting where parties are littered with drugs and alcohol, early treatment could prevent dangerous habits from turning into a lifelong dependencies. Though many students at The Haven said they overcame dangerous addictions, others use the community as a safe place where they can get through school without drinking.
“I came to USC, and that’s really where my drug and alcohol problems began,” said Techentin, who is 12 1/2 years sober. “The word needs to get out that it’s okay. This problem exists, and there’s ways to treat it and live life and have fun and not have to hide off in some rehab or leave the school out of shame. You can coexist in the collegiate environment and stay sober.”
Ten students currently live in The Haven’s residential community, with several more slated to move in this January. The Haven utilizes weekly individual wellness plans created in collaboration with Techentin, community gatherings and service work. It also addresses optional tutoring sessions, sober outings, retreats and more.
Almost all of The Haven’s services are free. For students who are not sure about entering the recovery program, The Haven hosts meetings every Sunday on the roof of Gateway at 6 p.m. Attendees do not need to be sober nor in a recovery program to show up.

Last year, the Fighting Irish beat the Trojans at the Coliseum in a grueling 22-13 victory. Saturday will be a pivotal game for USC in its first road game under interim head coach Ed Orgeron.

The Trojans held fast-paced practices on Monday and Tuesday before a lighter practice on Wednesday preceding their travel day on Thursday. Once the Trojans arrive in South Bend, they’ll have another full practice on Friday before resting up for Saturday night’s showdown.
Orgeron said that many players who have seen limited minutes this season will get a chance to play against Notre Dame, including junior defensive end J.R. Tavai, redshirt sophomore defensive tackle Antwaun Woods and redshirt sophomore linebacker Anthony Sarao.
On the Mend 
The return of a few key players to the Trojans lineup, headlined by redshirt junior cornerback Anthony Brown, gives hope that the team might finally regain the depth it needs to compete against the Fighting Irish.
Notre Dame’s receiving corps, headlined by senior TJ Jones (481 receiving yards, four touchdowns) and junior Davaris Daniels (385 receiving yards, four touchdowns), will provide a challenge for USC’s panned secondary.
The unit has received much criticism after giving up a combined 714 passing yards over the last two games, but the return of Brown gives USC another option to plug into its pass defense.
“I was supposed to be back for ASU, so I was a little behind schedule,” Brown said. “But I’m happy to be back for a big game.”
Brown says he is focusing on quick routes and communication. The agile cornerback will replace senior Torin Harris as starter.
Orgeron said senior linebacker Morgan Breslin will most likely be ready to take the field come Saturday as well after having great practices this week, but that redshirt sophomore running back Tre Madden is questionable to return on Saturday.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee told media yesterday he was 100 percent sure he would be back, despite the fact that “a knee injury is no joke.” But Orgeron said he doesn’t know if his star wideout is going to be available.
Old Practices, New Rituals 
Orgeron played a song for the team on “Competition Tuesday” that the team has taken to quickly — “Halftime (Stand Up and Get Crunk!)” by the Ying Yang Twins, which is the kickoff song for the New Orleans Saints.
“I said if I ever had the chance to be a head coach again I would play this for my guys,” Orgeron said.
The players seemed to enjoy the song, so much so that they asked for it to be played in the locker room before games.
After practice, most of the Trojans’ skill players participated in a foot race, which redshirt junior cornerback Josh Shaw won.

After playing in a few tournaments this fall, USC’s men’s and women’s tennis teams are finally falling into their rhythms.
Dominant duo · Senior Kaitlyn Christian is one-half of USC’s most dominant duo, along with junior Sabrina Santamaria. The pair won the national title last year and currently rank as the No. 1 doubles team in the nation. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Both teams are gearing up for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Southwest Regional Championships, where they will compete against players from UCLA, San Diego State, Cal Poly, Pepperdine, Hawai’i and other schools from the Southwest.
The women’s tournament will be played in San Diego, Calif. from Oct. 17 to 21.
In last year’s ITA Regional tournament, the Women of Troy claimed the doubles championship when then-seniors Danielle Lao and Valeria Pulido defeated a duo from UCLA.
Though these two have since graduated, the women’s team has continued to impress in doubles.
Junior Sabrina Santamaria and senior Kaitlyn Christian, who won the national championship together last year, are currently ranked No. 1 in the nation by the ITA. But this dominant duo has yet to compete this season, and another has stepped up and impressed.
In their most recent tournament, juniors Zoë Scandalis and Giuliana Olmos fought through the prequalifying and qualifying rounds to finish second in the main draw despite being ranked No. 54 in the nation prior to the competition. Though they fell in the championship match to a pair from UCLA, the team showed great promise and ability to complement the play of Santamaria and Christian.
Last year, the men also dominated the doubles draw in this tournament. Two Trojan teams faced off in the finals, and then-sophomores Eric Johnson and Yannick Hanfmann emerged victorious over then-sophomore Roberto Quiroz and then-freshman Max de Vroome.
This year, Quiroz is set to partner up with senior Ray Sarmiento as the top seed in doubles, while Johnson and de Vroome are seeded fifth.
Despite a surprisingly early defeat in the ITA All-American Championships two weeks ago, Sarmiento enters the tournament as the No. 1 seed in singles.
Though Sarmiento was upset in the third round, senior Michael Grant and junior Jonny Wang pulled off some surprising victories of their own at the ITA All-American Tournament. Grant took down the No. 54 player in the ITA’s preseason poll, while Wang upended the No. 3 player in the nation, earning a high seed this weekend.
Many more Trojans also earned high seeds. Hanfmann has yet to play this season, but was selected as the second seed, while Quiroz is seeded fourth. Wang and Grant are seeded seventh and eighth, respectively, and Johnson earned an eight-seed as well.
The men’s tournament will be hosted in Malibu, Calif. from Oct. 19 to 22.

The Greatest Intersectional Rivalry in College Football.
That’s what they like to call the annual showdown between USC and Notre Dame that first took place in 1925. The tale goes that USC was looking for a “rival” from somewhere besides the West Coast, and went after Notre Dame. Legendary Irish coach Knute Rockne didn’t like the idea of all the travel involved, but his wife wanted to get out of snowy South Bend and out to sunny Southern California, and the rest is history.
But why? How does this rivalry still hold so strong, almost 90 years later? Both teams treat this game as the most important on their schedules, and this is a fact. In years when the Irish come to Los Angeles, USC puts them on Thanksgiving weekend. It’s not any old game that gets played then. And every year, every home game Notre Dame plays starts at 3:30 p.m. ET. Except for one. That’s always the Trojans.
Here’s the thing: I didn’t grow up with USC, as many here did. I didn’t follow the rise of Pete Carroll or the dominance of Reggie Bush (Am I allowed to say that? Is he a real person? I can’t tell anymore). Of course I watched their incredible achievements, especially when they came at the expense of the Cal Bears teams I pulled for (and Cal was actually quite good back then). And of course I saw the Bush-push game; an instant classic in the annals of college football lore. But I wasn’t versed in “Trojan Spirit,” so to speak. Or history.
The first USC home game I ever attended was Nov. 29, 2008. It was against Notre Dame (it was also the last time the Trojans beat the Irish at home), and a terrible Notre Dame team. This was a bad time for Notre Dame football — the second of three straight seasons without a winning record in the regular season, a 16-21 mark over that stretch — but this game might have been the worst of them all, including a 38-0 shutout the year before. The Irish had 91 yards of total offense. They didn’t even so much as get a first down until the last play of the third quarter, and received heavy and sarcastic applause from the Trojan faithful when they finally did.
But what I remember most is the Notre Dame fans. Specifically, I remember their shirts. They had a shiny “golden dome” printed on the front, accompanied by four words: “Notre Dame football: Tradition.” It was impossible not to roll my eyes, in much the same way opposing fans do when the USC band plays those two bars of “Tribute to Troy” for the 18th time in the first quarter alone.
I walked away from that game joking that I was choking on the “smug” (with a U) emanating from both fanbases at the Coliseum (this was right after the South Park episode came out. You either know what I’m talking about or you don’t). They were both so full of it, so arrogant, so damn proud. And I realized right then why these two teams are rivals.
Both programs have insanely high opinions of themselves, justifiably so. Eleven National Championships and 32 bowl wins sort of speak here for itself. And as groan-inducing as Notre Dame’s “Tradition” shirts might be, they’re true. This evening, I will be getting on a plane to Chicago. Saturday, I will walk into Notre Dame Stadium. And I have never been more excited for a road game.
I’ve made some cool trips in my time covering USC football — the Weekender every year, Seattle last season. I was at Autzen Stadium when USC upset Oregon in Eugene back in 2011. But this is different. This is Notre Dame. Perhaps it is unfair to places such as Austin (Texas), State College (Pennsylvania) or Baton Rouge (Louisiana), but South Bend is college football’s Mecca. The slash mark endzones, Touchdown Jesus, “Play like a champion today.” Notre Dame Stadium is an icon, a cathedral of the game, if you will.
“It’s a great place to play,” USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron said of South Bend. “You grew up watching it, USC-Notre Dame. You wanted to be a part of it.”
The Trojans’ mantra, like just about all other teams, tends to be along the lines of “one game at a time.” But come on now, this is Notre Dame week.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee admitted that “Notre Dame is a big, big game for us.”
“The atmosphere there is amazing,” said redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler, who made the trip with the team in 2011 while redshirting. “To be able to start and play in this game is just so big, the tradition, all the great names that have played in this game. I’m very excited.”
Aren’t we all.

The recent model for star USC wide receivers is to flash glimpses of potential as a freshman and burst onto the scene as a sophomore. Current Buffalo Bill Robert Woods did it first, with junior Marqise Lee following in his footsteps last season by winning the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the nation’s best wideout.

After a freshman season highlighted by an explosive 6-catch, 162-yard game against Oregon last year, sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor seemed primed for a breakout 2013 campaign entering the year.
Prior to the Arizona game, however, Agholor’s statistical output this season just wasn’t indicative of a dominant sophomore season. Despite demonstrating immense talent both as a receiver and a blocker, Agholor had yet to record more than four receptions or 64 receiving yards.
But less than three minutes into last week’s battle against Arizona, that latter mark was nearly eclipsed on one play.
Agholor sped past the Arizona secondary, caught a perfect deep ball from redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler and ran into the end zone to complete a stunning one-play, 62-yard drive.
“I thought Cody threw a great ball and put a lot of trust in me to go get under it, and I think I made the play I needed to make,” Agholor said.
The first catch was just a taste of what was to come later. Kessler and Agholor continued to connect throughout the night as Agholor totaled a career-high seven receptions for 161 yards. The agile receiver carved up the Wildcats in a variety of different ways, showcasing his versatility as a precise route runner and deep threat. Whether it was catching the ball in stride across the middle of the field or making tough catches near the boundaries, Agholor’s wide array of skills was on display.
The sophomore standout’s performance came at an opportune time for the Trojans, a team beleaguered by injuries, specifically paper-thin at the wide receiver position. With only two scholarship receivers suiting up last Thursday, Agholor’s clutch game showed the wideout’s knack for coming up big when it counts.
He wasn’t the only Trojan player thrust into a bigger role than usual. USC’s new playcaller, offensive coordinator Clay Helton, put a greater emphasis on spreading the ball around. Five running backs had multiple carries, and Kessler hit six different targets throughout the game, with Agholor accounting for more than half of the reception yardage.
“Someone on our team had to make plays,” Agholor said. “I’m just very happy Coach [Helton] put the ball in my hands to make some plays. And he put the ball in a lot of guys’ hands to make plays, and we did.”
As the Trojans look forward to Notre Dame on Saturday, Agholor’s emergence as a dependable No. 1 option while Lee is sidelined has eased some of the concerns surrounding the viability of the Trojan offense without its star receiver. You can bet the Fighting Irish are aware of Agholor’s breakout performance, and the Notre Dame defense will be sure to key in on the sophomore come Saturday.
The Trojan offense might be buoyed by the possible return of Lee — after practice on Tuesday, Lee said he was “coming around pretty good,” and that, “by Saturday, [he] thinks [he’ll] be 100 percent.”
If Lee is healthy enough to play Saturday, Agholor will be able to exploit favorable one-on-one matchups and build on his game against the Wildcats. Another solid outing against Notre Dame could propel Agholor towards a tremendous second half of the season, putting him back on track in terms of following the trajectory of Woods and Lee — not to mention restoring hope for a successful USC season.
But interim head coach Ed Orgeron doesn’t want the team to put too much stock in the Notre Dame game.
“I don’t want to make it bigger than life,” Orgeron said. “This is game two of our season together.”
Orgeron’s vision has many of the Trojans excited, including Agholor.
“I’m looking to take advantage of all the opportunities that are given to us,” Agholor said when talking about the remainder of the season. “We are all given many opportunities, and if we take advantage of it, I think we will be in good shape.”
If Arizona was any indication, giving Agholor opportunities is a recipe for success. If that strategy continues against Notre Dame and beyond, the Trojan offense looks to be in good hands.

College football is setting out to reform the oft-criticized BCS system currently in place — and USC Athletic Director Pat Haden will be a part of the solution.
On the spot · USC athletic director Pat Haden is part of a group that will certainly be scrutinized for its choices of NCAA football playoff teams. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The NCAA is set to reform how it decides the nation’s college football champion with a playoff system that will go into effect next season.
Rumors had been flying about the specific members who will be a part of the selection committee, but the entire group of 13 was formally announced on Wednesday — and it includes Haden.
Haden will join the likes of former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and “father of football” Archie Manning, father of NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli, in the group that will be responsible for the seeding and placement of the top teams into the year-end playoffs.
“We went in looking at five groups of people because we wanted a broad representation,” College Football Playoff Executive Director Bill Hancock said in a media teleconference on Wednesday. “We have coaches, former players, administrators, journalists … They represent the top level of education.”
Haden, a former Rhodes Scholar, won two national championships during his time as a USC quarterback and also won a Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams. He served on USC’s Board of Trustees from 1991 until 2010 before his eventual appointment to oversee the entire athletic program.
Though Haden is undeniably a symbol of USC football, he will not be able to discuss the Trojans when they enter the seeding discussion — assuming, of course, that he’ll remain employed at USC for the entirety of his term on the committee. He will, however, be allowed to discuss the other teams in the Pac-12.
“The committee members do not represent any conference or regions of the country,” Hancock added. “We represent college football.”
Each committee member will be asked to follow a specific conference and gather data about those teams. Most would assume that Haden would then be responsible for the Pac-12, the conference he clearly is closest to, but that does not seem like it will be the case.
“Within the process we will assign many members to gather data about a particular conference,” Hancock said. “Typically it will not be a conference they were associated with.”
Haden already has one of the most difficult athletic positions in the nation, serving as the head of the athletics at USC, a school with much lore and history. The Trojans are in a difficult place right now, with the football program still trying to climb its way out of NCAA sanctions with no permanent head football coach currently in place.
To top that off, he is joining what will most assuredly be one of the most-dissected committees in the history of college athletics.

We all enjoy doing things we’re not supposed to do: staying up late on a school night, driving over the speed limit, mixing business and pleasure, even drinking while underage. I’m not making any confessions or pointing any fingers, but let’s be honest: It has happened. There was a time, however, when nobody, no matter his or her age, was allowed to legally drink.
This dark, dry time is known as Prohibition. The national ban on the sale, production and transportation of alcohol began in 1920 and lasted until 1933. Though the ban was the result of government meddling, modern culture associates Prohibition with rule breaking and drunken revelry.
After all, Prohibition was when Jay Gatsby’s infamous West Egg parties took place. Whether you like the book or the 1974 movie or the recent Baz Luhrmann extravaganza or none of the above, you cannot deny that attending one of these contraband parties would be nothing short of perfect. Music blasted, partygoers dressed to the nines and the libations were freely poured.
As a result, the Prohibition era is romanticized. It is in fashion to look like a floozy flapper or to don some raggedy newsboy cap that your grandpa might have worn. Kristen Wiig even made the Charleston hip again when she used it in Bridesmaids as proof of her sobriety. Speaking of sobriety, this brings us to the subject at hand: moonshine.
Recently, moonshine has been making a sly comeback. Riding on the coattails of handcrafted beers and all things Prohibition-chic, moonshine is available from smaller distilleries as well as on the shelves of certain chain stores. It is a resurfacing trend that is also in the process of being appropriated by the thirsty masses.
A product of necessity, moonshine was the illegal hooch made by renegades of the Appalachian Mountains. Ever the innovators, those feisty mountaineers knew how to make a mean brew. Moonshine became necessary because many Americans did not want to pay high taxes on spirits. Once Prohibition rolled around, the moonshine practice became a way to keep hydrated without the authorities knowing.
Backwoods distilleries became part of an underground network of rum-runners and moonshiners, people who made their own spirits with makeshift devices before homemade products were considered hip. Nowadays, this affinity for DIY products translates to a consumer desire for things that are not mass-produced but instead unique and hard to find. The more obscure, the better — you know how it goes.
Enter moonshine. National liquor laws are much more lax than they used to be, especially in Tennessee, where the ban on moonshine has been completely lifted. Take into consideration the recent fascination with ’20s-era style, and we have ourselves a trend.
Just as major beer companies realized that smaller breweries were edging them out of their own business, and thus created crafty beers such as Lagunitas IPA, major whiskey companies have jumped on the moonshine bandwagon. Jack Daniels released a white whiskey called Unaged Tennessee Rye and Jim Beam has Jacob’s Ghost.
So what’s the difference between regular whiskey and moonshine? The most obvious difference lies in the name. Moonshine, or white whiskey, is a clear liquid because it has not been aged for years in wood barrels. This aging process is what gives whiskey its various flavors and brown shades. Unaged whiskey, however, retains its clear hue and pure alcohol taste if left unflavored.
The first time I tried moonshine was at my brother’s wedding last May. His friend Ryan brought a flask full of clear liquid. Naturally, the other groomsmen and I pregamed the ceremony so we could perform our wedding duties with care and precision. My chief goal was to give a speech at the reception and that last swig of moonshine really did me in. It smelled like death and tasted even worse, but it was the liquid courage I needed to speak in front of the large crowd.
Unaged whiskeys such as these are now available all over the country. Ryan got his Pennsylvania-bottled ’shine from a Chelsea market. Local liquor stores in urban areas also carry various brands. I recently bought some moonshine from Pavilions, of all places.
Midnight Moon, made by Piedmont Distillery in Madison, N.C., is the brand I purchased. The recipe is based on the same one used by Junior Johnson, a legendary moonshiner and member of the NASCAR Hall of Fame (NASCAR was invented by moonshiners, by the way). There are plenty of flavors to choose from, but I picked Apple Pie and Cherry. Apple Pie is bottled at 70 proof, making it 35 percent alcohol while Cherry is 100 proof.
Before taking a sip, I expected the same kick as the wedding moonshine — meaning I anticipated a mouthful of rubbing alcohol. Actually, Apple Pie tastes like Fireball whiskey and is definitely drinkable on its own. Cherry, however, is a different story. On its own, Cherry tastes like semi-sweet cough syrup but once mixed with soda, it tasted like a fountain drink. Later I tried the cherry placed at the bottom of the moonshine jar, thinking it would taste like an alcoholic Maraschino cherry. I was gravely wrong.
Now, lest you get any funny ideas about starting your own beverage business on the side, be warned: Distilling moonshine is a dangerous process. If done incorrectly, poisonous impurities will remain in the liquid. That’s why moonshine production is best left to the pros — they’ve been doing it for a while. Modern moonshine consumption no longer requires product smuggling, just knowledge of what local store carries your favorite brand of mountain dew.
As if all of this weren’t enough, most moonshine products are bottled and sold in Mason jars. It doesn’t get much trendier than that.

The ethereal, independent horror film Toad Road, which premieres this Friday at Hollywood’s Arena Cinema, asks, “How far would you be willing to go down Toad Road?”
Psychedelic horror · Toad Road was filmed with virtually no budget and a full cast of amateur actors. The film caught the attention of Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood, who signed on as the film’s producer. – Photo courtesy of Artsploitation Films
The film, which was written, produced and directed by Jason Banker, chronicles the nightmarish misadventures of a young drug user  James. Sarah, a new arrival into the small rural town, begins experimenting with narcotics with James. The two also visit Toad Road, a spot in the forest that — as local legend has it — leads to the Seven Gates of Hell.
Banker took the idea for the story from a real legend that haunts his hometown of York, Pa. The story caused kids from his local high school to walk down Toad Road to see how far they can go without turning back.
“I wanted to make a film that was a combination of a documentary and a narrative film,” Banker said. “I’ve been doing documentaries for a long time and I wanted to do something a little bit different, where I had control of the story to a certain degree. But I also wanted to incorporate real people, like I’m discovering who these people are and the dynamic between this real group of friends, and then merging my story into that.”
To cement this sense of authenticity, Banker took a cue from filmmaker Larry Clark, casting amateurs instead of professional actors. Banker found them on MySpace from towns he felt had strong countercultures. From there, he said, it was all one big experiment.
“I found a group of people and I didn’t really know who was going to be the lead and who was going to play what role,” he said. “I was very open to different dynamics between the group of friends and using that in the film as we went along. It wasn’t really written out — it was more or less improvised with the idea of the fictional story that I had as a backbone.”
Despite being his first acting job, James Davidson, who plays the protagonist of the same name, said he felt very much involved with the creation of the film due to its improvisational nature.
“It was a really organic experience,” Davidson said. “Jason was willing to try anything and took a bunch of risks. Just the amount of footage we have that wasn’t used is unbelievable. He would set up the scene, we would sort of fumble our way through it, and based on tensions with a friend, that would be a springboard for another subplot.”
Davidson said he had to do little to prepare for the role, as the character of “James” wasn’t so much an artificial entity as it was a natural extension of him as a person.
“We were let loose and sort of dangerously so,” Davidson said. “We didn’t have to get into the character — he found people who were the characters. [Every scene] that wasn’t directly moving along the Toad Road plot and the gates to hell was literally just us hanging out or drinking or doing terrible things to each other.”
Filming took place primarily in Baltimore, where Davidson and his friends lived, with scenes of the actual Toad Road shot in Banker’s hometown in York.
With nearly no budget and a video camera to shoot with himself, Banker said he found it “pretty amazing” that this small, no-budget film has gotten this far: Toad Road will premiere on both coasts and actor Elijah Wood signed on as an executive producer.
Though much of the film deals heavily with drug use, its hallucinatory quality had to be conveyed through the power of storytelling rather than special effects because of the film’s limited funds.
“I thought it would be cool to mix drug use with a type of horror theme, where the main character, and the viewers too, aren’t really sure if it’s reality, or if it’s a consequence of drug use, or if it’s urban legend,” Banker said. “There are a lot of different levels you can perceive the film. A lot of the drug use in the film is real.”
The storyline mirrors the trajectory of experiences that one goes through while experimenting with drugs -— a “bad trip,” as Banker puts it.
“There’s kind of this phase of discovery where you’re testing it out, and as you delve more into that world, it can get darker,” he said. “It can lead to some places that are bizarre versions of reality. I wanted to make a film that felt like that. At first, you’re following this character that is just getting into drug use, and then she has a bad trip and it starts to get worse, and then it’s enlightening, and then it’s a mixture of all that stuff.”
Banker said he wanted to gear the film toward an early-20s crowd. He felt that this demographic could relate to making their own decisions, sometimes the wrong ones, and pushing their boundaries and sometimes going too far.
“I hope that it at least makes people question where the line is between self-discovery and self-destruction,” Banker said. “When I was growing up, I was afraid of trying drugs and I was afraid of a lot of things. That fear — it’s healthy, but at the same time, it’s pretty boring if you only see life through one lens. You should try and expand your mind and realize that there are multiple levels of reality out there and there’s different ways to perceive any particular thing.”
Davidson echoes this philosophy. Though Toad Road might be a horror film, it appeals to a more intellectual side of viewers.
“It can be very jarring and alarming and upsetting at times,” Davidson said. “But it’s also just a really beautiful and bleak exploration of the reckless nature of that age.”

The American education system has reached its limits in creating an ineffective system: standardized testing for kindergarteners.
Nancy Chiu | Daily Trojan
 
According to the New York Daily News, because of new state standards and more intensive evaluations of teachers, some 4 and 5-year-olds living in New York City are taking Common Core standardized math tests.
The administered tests have gone about as well as you’d expect. Teachers have complained that the students are having trouble taking a multiple-choice test since they have not even learned how to write or count properly. For these tests, which require them to associate numbers and images, kids must use No. 2 pencils compared to the crayons or markers that they are accustomed to.
Proponents say that the material kindergarteners are tested on is important. The testing, however, makes an assessment of skills that these children haven’t even had a chance to develop.
Knowing what the right answer to a math question is does not teach someone how to discern a mathematical problem, it merely teaches them what the right answer is, rather than the method it takes to get there.
Madhabi Chatterji, an associate professor and director of the Assessment and Evaluation Research Initiative at Columbia University, said having assessments at this age assumes children have fully developed skills. If there must be an evaluation, it should be on how a child functions typically and naturally.
A standardized test does not demonstrate children’s ability to be creative, how they approach logical puzzles or abstract concepts or if they’re developing practical scientific skills. Students have to learn by experience, not just through testing.
Compared to what the state would like to believe, kindergarteners are not fully developed test-takers. Kids interacting with other students develop social skills and situational problem-solving capabilities. Allowing them to play with blocks gives them their first introduction to basic geometry. Allowing a growing mind to learn and discover not only creates a strong student but also a student better prepared for the real world.
Standardized testing is not in the best interest of the students. Testing and teacher evaluations factor into federal and state funding. It does not directly focus on students’ readiness for a college degree and functioning in the workforce.
For many of the schools incorporating this kindergarten testing, the only means of getting more funding is through high standardized test performance.
Unfortunately, because of this, they are forced to strip down the overall curriculum since other subjects are now irrelevant. It was bad enough to take away recess at some schools, but now even subjects such as history, art and the sciences have progressively become diminished as schools change in accordance with the tests (which are corporate funded and state approved, meaning they’re subject to any ulterior bias associated with those entities).
The schools aren’t entirely at fault. The problem is the way the system is set up. Schools have to focus all of their energy on doing well on the tests so they can stay funded and allow teachers to keep their jobs.
The country’s education has turned into an assembly line through its reliance on standardized testing. By focusing so much on standardized testing, students young and old are missing out on developing actual intellectual initiative.
Introducing testing at such a young age is more detrimental than it is beneficial. It is molding students to study in a way that might give them the correct answer, but doesn’t encourage them to understand the process behind it.

RAS…do your research: dianeravitch.com and classsizematters.com. Read The Death and Life of the Great American School System and Reign of Error. I challenge you to take all the tests our students take; e.g. classroom curriculum testing, district testing (several different tests; some given 3 or 4 times a year), the state assessment, the national assessment (NAEP), ACT/SAT and PSAT, etc…. Our students are tested to death and it’s usurping the fun and discovery out of education. We don’t manufacture anything anymore in this country and our elected officials and corporate America have discovered a TRILLION dollar marketplace in education and they really don’t care what effect it has on our children; their children go to private schools. China is moving AWAY from standardized testing because it has generations of people with no creativity; read Yong Zhao. Our students aren’t wimps; they’re exhausted! The most successful school system in the world is in Finland. They don’t give standardized test and very little homework. RAS…do your research.
Is something happening to the kids in US? I agree we should not make testing such a crazed obsession. However, we are coddling them into little sniveling wimps that will eventually hit extreme laughable heights in a generation or so. 
How is it Germans, Japanese, British students can sit down and complete a test without the kind of drama depicted in this article? I think we are raising kids to be far too undisciplined and the rising level of D-baggery seems to corroborate this statement. 
Again – I am not saying we should give 5 yr old a nervous breakdown from over emphasizing tests – but we should also not raise kids to be such wimps that they get a nervous breakdown just from a sheet of paper being placed in front of them. Suck it up kids!
Dear Ras,
I think you need to be Common Core standardized tested as you clearly didn’t read the article. Your posting is completely irrelevant. The article is about a mismatch between the skills children have at this age, and the skills demanded of these tests. You write about something quite different.

Congress finally reached a solution to the debt crisis. It is now up to us to evaluate the rules that contributed to the lengthy political stalemate. But sometimes, the rules themselves can create the problems. Here are three procedural rules that have played a role in dragging out the current fiasco.
1. The Cantor Rule.
Think Progress reported earlier this week that two hours before the shutdown, House Republicans held one of the most significant but under-reported votes this year. The vote amended House Rule 22 Clause 4, which previously read, “When the stage of disagreement has been reached on a bill or resolution with House or Senate amendments, a motion to dispose of any amendment shall be privileged.” With the passage of “House Resolution 368,” the House GOP took away from any member of the House the privilege of motioning for a vote on any bill (but really the bill to avoid a shutdown), and gave that power exclusively to Eric Cantor.  The formal text of the amendment reads, “Section 2 of the rule provides that any motion pursuant to Clause 4 of rule XXII relating to the H.J. Res. 59 may be offered only by the Majority Leader or his designee.” Two hours later, the government shut down.
2. The filibuster.
Derived from the Dutch word meaning “pirate,” the filibuster tactic allows the minority party in the Senate to prolong debate on a piece of legislation to significantly delay its passage, and ultimately force the bill’s sponsors to rewrite it or scrap it to appease the challengers. According to The Week, in December 2012, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) even filibustered his own bill to raise the debt ceiling, after realizing that it was favorable to President Barack Obama.
A filibuster can only be ended by a cloture vote, which usually requires 60 Senators. According to The New Yorker, “the majority sought cloture 58 times from the period 1917 to 1970. Since President Obama’s inauguration, the Democratic majority in the senate has sought cloture more than 250 times.”
The most frightening aspect of the filibuster is the procedural rule that allows the mere “threat” of a filibuster to block debate. Logically, those in the majority should be able to force the filibustering minority to actually carry out the threat to “talk a piece of legislation to death.” This rarely happens, thanks to a little-known thing called the “quorum rule.” Senate rules require a quorum of 51 present senators for normal business to take place. Because this never happens (and is subject for a column of its own), the Senate operates under “presumptive quorum” and essentially pretends that a quorum is present in order to operate daily.
According to the Senate’s standing rules, in the  middle of a filibuster speech, the speaker can suggest absence of a quorum, and force a roll call — if 51 Senators are not present (which they would not be in the middle of a hypothetical 2 a.m. filibuster), the Senate automatically adjourns for the day, and the filibuster is allowed to resume the following morning.
The Senate rules should be amended to only allow a speaker to suggest absence of a quorum during normal operating hours, say from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. This would allow the majority to force the minority to actually filibuster, though still protecting the need for senators to be present for daily business.
3. The Hastert Rule.
It’s easy to cringe when referring to this as a “rule.” Even the former House speaker for whom it is named, Dennis Hastert, has acknowledged “there really wasn’t a ‘Hastert Rule.’” Simply, the “rule” originates from Hastert’s decision in 2003 to not bring a bill to a vote in the House because it lacked the votes of the majority party. The Chicago Sun Times reported that Speaker of the House John Boehner has to break the “Hastert Rule” and bring a bill to resolve the fiscal negotiations to a vote due its intransigence bears mentioning. Earlier this year, Politico reported that Boehner said he would not bring comprehensive immigration reform to a vote without the support of the majority of Republicans in the House. The Hastert Rule should be treated with as much political significance as the underwear Obama sports at the State of the Union.
Exposing the preposterous procedural rules that make our government even more dysfunctional is necessary. It’s time for America to throw the challenge flag.

I fully support and appreciate the adage “Democracy is messy”.
However, in recent years, rather then that being a proud pillar of our political structure, it has become a cheap excuse for mealy-mouth politicians to bicker back and forth but FAIL TO TAKE ACTION.
I feel politicians lately are cowards who do not even really want their own ideas implemented. That way they avoid the possibility their own idea turns out to be a dud and they are to blame. What these cowards wold rather do is take far polar positions, bicker back and forth and never actually DO SOMETHING. This way they carry the ruse they are trying to fight the good fight is only the other side would let them. This is like the chicken-sh*t guy who feigns bravado and challenges the bigger guy to a fight – all the while hoping his buddies will hold him back while he carries on his tough talk.
Part of being a politician should have the required obligation to ultimately DO SOMETHING. After all the messy talks back and forth they all have to execute a plan. I am tired of paying tax dollars for these idiots to be all process and no product. Only can politicians burn time and money and not have anything to show for it. If this was a business like Apple, it would be like R&D arguing with Marketing – and rather then eventually come out with a path forward to new products eventually coming to market – all their days are filled with is back and forth. And as the company goes broke – they just squeeze more money from shareholders to fund their retarded debates.
I want more bang for my tax buck from both sides of the political spectrum. I know Democracy is messy, but if you do not have a path forward, just constant limbo – then you never have true democracy anyway.
