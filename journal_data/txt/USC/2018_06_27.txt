Following a tumultuous season filled with controversies, scandals and shortcomings, USC basketball fans had their eyes set on the NBA Draft to see where some of their favorite stars would land. Four Trojans have declared for the draft, but only two heard their name called on Thursday night.
De’Anthony Melton
De’Anthony Melton — USC’s highest selection in the 2018 Draft — was chosen 46th overall by the Houston Rockets. His selection as a second round pick surprised many, as media outlets such as ESPN and Sports Illustrated had Melton slotted in the 20s. Despite the 6-foot-4 guard not playing a single minute this season amid an ongoing FBI scandal, NBA teams were intrigued by Melton’s size, playmaking and defensive versatility during his only season at USC. In 2016-2017, he averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.8 steals per game.
Melton will look to crack the rotation and become the steal of the draft on a Rockets team that came up just one game short of an NBA Finals appearance and already features a starting backcourt of reigning league MVP James Harden and 2017 Sixth Man of Year Eric Gordon.
Chimezie Metu
Junior forward Chimezie Metu was selected by the San Antonio Spurs as the 49th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. During his three years at USC, Metu recorded a .533 shooting percentage. (Daily Trojan file photo).
Chimezie Metu, the Trojans’ leading scorer and rebounder in 2018, was selected 49th overall by the San Antonio Spurs. Though many project Metu to spend time in the G League this season, scouts are optimistic Metu will develop into a serviceable two-way big man who can block shots (1.7 per game in 2018) and score willingly at the NBA level with his athleticism and mobility in the long run.
His opportunity for significant minutes may also come sooner than some expect with the uncertain future of franchise cornerstone Kawhi Leonard and an aging Pau Gasol. As he develops, he will look to help lead a youth movement in San Antonio that features All-Defensive 2nd Team point guard Dejounte Murray, and the 18th selection in this year’s draft,  Lonnie Walker IV from Miami. 
Jordan McLaughlin
Jordan McLaughlin, arguably the face of USC basketball for the past four years, went undrafted but has agreed to play in the summer league and training camp with the Brooklyn Nets. Though McLaughlin doesn’t have the elite athleticism of his peers, there is no question in his leadership and ability to distribute the ball. In his four-year career as a Trojan, McLaughlin finished second all-time in assists and fourth all-time in scoring in USC history. USC head coach Andy Enfield, vouched for his point guard in an interview with the Orange County Register. 
“He has the best court vision, probably, of any point guard in the country,” Enfield said. 
McLaughlin will look to earn a roster spot with strong performances in the summer league. 
Elijah Stewart
Elijah Stewart, USC’s all-time leader in 3-pointers made and games played, also went undrafted despite working out for multiple NBA teams during the pre-draft process. He will spend training camp and summer league with the Indiana Pacers. Despite going undrafted, Stewart’s elite 3-point shooting ability and defensive intensity (126 blocks in four years) are skills many NBA teams in this floor-spreading era desire. With Victor Oladipo emerging as the face of the franchise and commanding defensive attention, opportunities for Stewart to show what he excelled at in Los Angeles may be on the horizon.

The first section of nearly 10,000 new seats were recently installed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Eight temporary press boxes are also being erected to host members of the press. (Emily Smith/Daily Trojan).
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has been collecting history since its opening in the summer of 1923. It was constructed as a living memorial for the U.S.  Armed Forces in World War I, and it immediately became home to USC football. While it has never wavered as a sacred place for Trojans fans, the Coliseum has hosted many other sports teams throughout the years including the UCLA Bruins (1933-1981), the Los Angeles Rams (1946-1979, 2016-2019), and even temporarily the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958-1961).
It has also served as a concert venue for some great rock legends such as The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen and Prince. 
While it is viewed as a piece of L.A.’s athletic history, the stadium has also been host  to political leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Cesar Chavez. Its versatility has always prevailed, from hosting Pope John Paul II’s Papal Mass in 1987, to setting the Guinness World Record for highest number of fans in attendance at a baseball game for a Dodgers vs. Red Sox match in 2008. And soon enough, it will go down in history as the only venue to have hosted three Summer Olympics — in 1932, 1984 and 2028, respectively. Now, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is on its way to becoming the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum, which is scheduled for completion by Fall 2019. 
Despite these major renovations, the Coliseum has multiple seen changes in its 95-year history. Players used to enter through the 50-yard line tunnel until 1949, when it eventually got covered up. In 1993, the stadium underwent a notably smaller renovation, where all bleachers were replaced with individual seats.
The Coliseum’s current renovation includes the installation of more handrails throughout seating areas, as well as the replacement of every seat to increase legroom and seat width. Beyond new seating arrangements, USC is  upgrading the stadium’s electrical and plumbing systems and improving Wi-Fi access in the venue.
The preservation of the Coliseum’s history remains a top priority during the renovation. USC is looking to restore the peristyle end to make it closer to its original construction, leaving the iconic torch and Olympic rings. The jerseys displaying the Trojans’  Heisman winners will also remain in place.
The renovated Coliseum will boast two new screens on the east end of the stadium to complement the 6,000-foot high-definition screen over the players’ tunnel, which was added in 2011. It will be complete with upgraded audio technology and new lighting, as well as luxury suites and club seats on the south side. 
The University is currently in the process of installing temporary press boxes to ensure its availability for the 2018 football season. 
Luckily for USC students, the student and band sections will remain where they have been. They remain a top priority so as not to compromise the experience for the home team.

El Tri defeated the reigning champion Germany in its World Cup debut. Every commentator, every analyst, every Mexican person with a realistic mentality believed that pulling off a win — or even a tie — would be nearly impossible. 
Everyone except my grandfather: The old man with the glistening white mustache, florid face and keen sense of humor. He believed that the Mexican squad, under the direction of coach Juan Carlos Osorio, could conquer the Mannschaft. And he was right, and so was Osorio.
On Father’s Day, I sat alongside him and my dad. We witnessed 90 minutes of tension and agony as Mexico bested Germany 1-0. I witnessed tears escaping my grandfather’s eyes, as the referee blew the final whistle. My dad and I observed his prideful and silent smile as the teams left the field.
I sat there reacting differently, phone in hand, channelling my emotions on Twitter and Instagram — sharing random memes and expressions only my Twitter followers  would understand. Filming the TV and channelling the soccer commentator in me to impress my Instagram followers, who don’t really care about hot men kicking around a ball.
As the son of Mexican immigrants, this victory was mine as much as it was my parents’. I am Mexican and have always identified as such. I have light skin, but I’m pretty sure my heart was replaced by a nopál. Everything about Mexico — my culture, my people — continues to fascinate me everyday. But it also contributed to my insecurity when I was a child.
I have never seemed like a stereotypical Mexican. My skin isn’t brown. My last name isn’t Hernandez or Garcia or Rivera. When people looked at me as a kid, they assumed my mom was my nanny and called me güerito or gringo. I hated it and throughout my life have had to prove to people my own Mexicanidad. 
I take pride in who I am and am not afraid to show it. Calling me Thomas isn’t gonna cut it. It’s Tomás — con acento.
That’s why this game meant so much to me. Because my country and my identity are a crucial part of who I am.
Mexicanos, like me, were glued to Telemundo, as Andrés Cantor, known for his deafening “GOOOOOOAAAAL,” commentated one of the most watched games in Spanish-language TV history.
For Mexicans in the U.S., the national team is holy. It’s a constant reminder of a country left behind. It’s a connection to a place that roughly 7 million undocumented Mexicans have yet to return to. And it’s a distraction from the reality of subordination that these people face in a country they cannot call their own.
Mexico’s lone goal against Germany provided hope for these people. Perhaps it did so just in the sport, but maybe in real life, too. Mexico did the impossible that morning and began living a dream — a dream similar to the one pictured by thousands of migrants who travel to this country with hope of a better future. 
The national team and the World Cup not only provide hope, but they also unite people: cooks and construction workers, landscapers and housekeepers, undocumented immigrants and legal residents. It reminds people of why they came to the U.S.. It brightens their day as their love for Mexico revives when they watch 11 men in green run around chasing a ball, just as they chased a dream in this country.
Mexico faces Sweden on Wednesday, following its triumphant matches against South Korea and Germany. El Tri has a high chance of beating the team that ousted four-time World Cup champion Italy.
Mexico will have to play like it’s the team’s last game, because it could be, if it loses. With a tie or a win, Mexico will secure its spot in the knockout stage and consequently put the team a step closer to getting to el quinto partido (the fifth game). If Mexico loses, things could get complicated.
Mexico hasn’t reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup since it last hosted the event in 1986. In the last World Cup, the referee awarded the Netherlands a nonexistent penalty kick, which led to Mexico’s elimination. In 2006 and 2010, it lost to the ever-so-powerful Argentina. And in 2002 … actually, I’d rather not talk about that one.
2018 just might be the year El Tri makes it into the top eight. My grandfather sure believes it can. 
That’s why on Wednesday, before heading to work, Mexicanos will again be glued to their screens to witness la selección’s final match in Group F. It’ll be a real test for the team, but if  El Tri wins, fans’ expectations for the knockout phase will be pretty high. Mexico will either face Brazil or Switzerland, two tough competitors, but ones the team has seen before.
Mexico probably won’t win the Cup, but that’s what I said about it defeating Germany. If it happens, this will be the year it does.

On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen presented the notion of global, human-caused climate change to the public. Testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Hansen said that his team was 99 percent certain that the global warming trend observed by numerous scientific groups was not naturally caused, but was the result of human activity paired with a buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In an interview that day, Hansen said: ‘’It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is strong that the greenhouse effect is here.’’
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last Saturday marked 30 years since Hansen’s testimony. Though phrases like “the greenhouse effect” and “global warming” have permeated our language and our supermarkets are filled with supposedly “green” or “eco-friendly” products, it is hard to be optimistic on this anniversary. Our weather is noticeably warmer, stormier and more extreme than ever before observed. 
Glaciers are melting at the poles and causing rising sea levels. Species are going extinct at alarming rates. Wildfires threaten our cities. Hansen and his team of doomsayers were correct, and it is immensely depressing to see our nation and global community still fail to take the issue seriously 30 years later.
In 1988, Hansen predicted that the planet’s average temperature would rise by 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2017. According to a report from the Associated Press, the predictions were only a bit off the mark. In the last 30 years, the planet has warmed by 1.6 degrees, and certain areas are up to three degrees hotter than they were in the late ’80s.
You don’t even need to look at the numbers to see the differences — they are all around you.
Winters are now shorter, with the first frost of fall happening an average of nine days later than it did 30 years ago, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, the last frost of spring occurs four days earlier. Plants have more time to flower, which has contributed to a global rise in allergies and asthma. Hurricane season starts almost a month earlier than it used to. Wildfires like those that enveloped Southern California in late 2017 are becoming more common as foliage dries out; wildfires in the United States now consume more than twice the acreage that they did three decades ago. And extreme weather is the new normal: Heat records at U.S. weather stations have been broken more than 2.3 million times while cold records have been broken 1.8 million times.
And yet, it seems that our society is still at the point where we need to be reminded to “stop waffling” on the issue. We’ve taken these 30 years to gather evidence, and though it would be thrilling to prove Hansen wrong, it turns out his predictions were correct, almost down to the decimal.
I don’t want to discount collective progress: Cities are making stronger efforts to reduce air pollution, electric vehicles are being normalized and alternative energy sources are growing. However, there seems to be no more time to sit back and gather data.
On this grim anniversary, our society’s journey seems almost Oedipal, in that we were warned, given a prophecy of what was to come, and in thinking that we could thwart it through denial, we walked directly into its prediction. In 1988, Hansen said that global warming was “in our living room.” Well, today it has barreled through the living room — leaving a gaping hole in the wall — and is now ransacking the entire house.
The momentum of global climate change is such that we may not be able to turn the trends around. However, we can at least slow or stop them in the next 30 years. I know it is a scary issue to consider; it is much easier to throw up our hands and retreat into comfortable nihilism than it is to call for change. 
Give your representatives a second call.  After talking to them about our country’s cruel immigration policy, ask them what their plan is for combating climate change. Pressure the institutions beholden to you — your school, your employer, the companies you give money to — to take substantive action. Sacrifice some personal comfort for the health of the planet, and really take stock of where you can reduce your impact.
These words can seem empty. After all, we are a generation that has grown up with pictures of starving polar bears, raised on false promises that turning off the faucet while brushing our teeth would save the planet. And now, we are forced to deal with a daily, depressing onslaught of news about how cruel humans can be. 
It’s difficult to make room for planetary issues when humanity feels doomed from all sides, but global warming just had its 30th birthday. So in an odd way, climate change is in our generation too — a millennial just like us. 
Large anniversaries like this one allow us to reflect on the progress we’ve made and the steps that still need to be taken, and I hope that in 30 years — when we’re entering our 50s and Hansen’s testimony turns 60 — we can look at our actions with pride.

It disappoints me that a reporter who should be devoted to truth, law faculty who should be devoted to justice, and other faculty who should support the rights of all in the University family to a fair hearing, would participate in a rush-to-justice takedown of USC President C. L. Max Nikias, sans due process — and before facts were in — including what was known by whom, when. 
Regarding the Puliafito scandal, it is unclear why any believe that a University president ought to have investigated the actions of a faculty member — with a consenting adult, off University grounds, on his private time. Salacious though the details may be, such misbehavior — since outside the realm of employment — is a matter not for the employer but the police — until a criminal conviction occurs. Few would approve an environment in which employers were in the business of investigating the private lives of their personnel. Why was this not pointed out?  
The behavior of former Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist George Tyndall, is the business of USC. Yet, I am perplexed by the pitch of vitriol directed at the president. And why now when Nikias already removed the offending party  a year ago?
He did so before the scandal, not because of it.  Unless someone has sound evidence that Nikias himself was aware of the gravity of the claims and flagrantly rejected action, he is not the guilty party.
Given that the gynecologist denied wrongdoing, paying him to go quietly was the expeditious means to ensure his removal. Anything else carries risks: There is always a chance he could prevail in an employee hearing. He could contend that looking at, feeling, and talking about patients’ private parts is part of the job description; what is at question is how he went about it. And for that, he might cite different norms from when he trained in his field.
It perplexes me that Nikias has been singled out for opprobrium in both cases, without evidence presented to justly place him at fault in either. Why are the most negative motives imputed? Why are moderating considerations omitted? Is it reckoned good journalism to topple a leader, whether or not they merit it? I wonder if the Los Angeles Times — or its reporters — has a hidden agenda. 
As I understand, Nikias fired two supervisors who failed to report the problem up the chain. He crafted an approach, so in the future, disgraceful actions could not be kept from those high in the administration — a centralized place to report ethics complaints. His solution would defend against such problems in the future. However, the solution others have proposed — deposing Nikias before facts are in — would not.
Whatever the Times may urge — or law faculty who, disturbingly, spurn notions of justice and due process — I urge that other faculty and media stand firm against complicity in a bullying mob-assault.  Those who incited Nikias’ ouster — and sullied his name indelibly — with no investigation to show him culpable, have lost their own moral authority in seeking to impugn his.
  Too many seem eager to fight one wrong (the actions of Tyndall) by committing another: destroying Nikias’ reputation, career and life. Consequently, these individuals are now risking the fate of our University before any evidence has even been presented in the court of law to incriminate him.
I wish more would speak out against the rush to (in)justice, and urge facts, reason and a fair process — not vigilantism — to determine a man’s and a university’s fates.

Rating: 2.5/5
Under the direction of frontman Brendon Urie, Panic! at the Disco has pledged its allegiance to pop punk with its newest record, “Pray for the Wicked.” The album marks a subtle departure from the band’s angsty sound, as Urie turns to mainstream radio influences following the band’s epic comeback project “Death of a Bachelor.” 
While earlier Panic! albums featured complex guitar riffs and literati song titles, “Pray” ventures into staccato instrumentation and laconic titles, presenting listeners with a record that appears perfectly clipped and computerized.  
The record’s hamartia is exactly that: The music relies more on electronic production than natural acoustics. While the contemporary influence has artfully and interestingly taken over the industry through artists across the musical spectrum, Panic!’s interpretation of the trend renders its songs nearly indecipherable from one another. 
This lack of strong instrumental distinction between songs, paired with repetitive lyrics, waters down the potential behind many of the tracks on “Pray.”
For instance, on “Roaring 20s,” while Urie’s belting almost overshadows his overdone bachelor persona, the lyrics become tiresome during the repetitive chorus: “This is my roaring, roaring 20s/I don’t even know me/Roll me like a blunt ‘cause I wanna go home.”
Similarly, many tracks seem to recycle old assertions with variations on common phrases. On “(F*ck a) Silver Lining,” Urie sings: “It’s coming up cherries on top!” Only a few tracks later the line becomes “Everything’s comin’ up aces, aces!” on “Hey Look Ma, I Made It.”
Panic! at the Disco’s sixth studio album, “Pray for the Wicked” was released on June 22. (Photo courtesy of Fueled by Ramen).
However, there are several redeeming moments on the record, particularly when Panic!’s clever songwriting overcomes Jake Sinclair’s tired production.   
On “Hey Look Ma, I Made It” and “Roaring 20s”, Urie sings about career woes and keeping up the momentum of success. It becomes clear, now and again, that underneath his slick, bad-boy charm, Urie is still struggling with his fame. “Maybe I’ll elevate, maybe I’m second rate/So unaware of my status,” he sings on “Roaring 20s.”
Moreover, Christian faith lingers as an overarching theme of the album. Apart from the title itself, words like “baptize,” “heaven,” “demons,” and “Holy Spirit” all find their way throughout the record, suggesting that Urie is looking beyond secular methods to deal with his struggles and towards a higher power. 
In a similarly vulnerable fashion,  “Dancing’s Not a Crime” takes an interesting spin on infidelity. Notably, the most fascinating aspect about the track is that it seems to be a direct response to the band’s 2013 hit “Girls /Girls / Boys.” 
On “Girls / Girls / Boys,” Urie consciously avoids a relationship, singing proudly about his aversion to becoming a “boyfriend.” In a complete character-arc, Urie has a change of heart on “Dancing’s Not a Crime,” as he sings, “And I just wanna be your boyfriend, girlfriend, yeah.”
It isn’t until the closer track that Urie presents the album’s standout track, “Dying in LA.”
Markedly different from the rest of “Pray,” this somber ballad expresses the heartbreak of unfulfilled Hollywood dreams with resonant, harmonic piano chords. While Urie never shies away from showcasing his impressive vocal range, “Dying in LA” particularly provides intimacy and connection to Urie’s bittersweet vibrato—something lacking in the remainder of the LP. 
While “Dying in LA” highlights the isolation that can come from being unsuccessful, it also brings dreams together in a twisted, melancholic unity. The song is  undeniably sad, but it ends on a semblance of hope, not necessarily for L.A., but for the future of Panic!’s evolving sound. “Dying in LA” is an example of just how brilliant the band can be. 
While most of “Pray for the Wicked” include Urie’s classically confident chants, there seems to be some hurt just beneath the surface. Perhaps the album cover could provide some insight: Urie stands on top of a building, looking down at the cityscape with his toes right at the edge of the building. What’s more — he appears to be praying. 
Perhaps fans can join in and pray for a new outlook on a future album: one that’s more inspired, and possibly more original.

Though Hulu’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” is marketed as a Biblical, dystopian drama, the horrors of the series often come uncannily close to reality. Known for its gut-wrenching moments and thought-provoking material, the second season’s 10th episode garnered mixed reviews because of its explicit content. 
Elisabeth Moss plays Offred, or June, in Hulu’s acclaimed series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” (Photo from IMDb).
Though the show gained viewership for its unapologetically graphic depictions of abuse, violence and rape, the increasingly grotesque season caused some viewers to question where to draw the line between empathy and exploitation.
The most recent episode, “The Last Ceremony,” was directed by Jeremy Podeswa, previously known for his work on HBO’s notoriously explicit “Game of Thrones.”
The episode opens with Emily (Alexis Bledel) being forced to endure yet another “ceremony,” a procession in which the prominent, infertile couples of Gilead attempt to inseminate their respective handmaids through what is essentially rape. 
Viewers watch Emily — who is easily one on the most tormented characters of the show — dissociate as her eyes glaze during the act. Offred’s (Elisabeth Moss) voice looms with the statement, “One detaches oneself.” 
Later in the episode, the same haunting voiceover returns to accompany the rape of a very pregnant (and very resistant) Offred — a heinous act committed by the Waterfords in hopes of inducing birth, but mostly reminding her of her tragically subservient role in their household.
The lingering sentiment “one detatches oneself” is a war cry for the show itself: Detatchment is the coping mechanism for Gilead’s women in the face of their tragic, exploitative realities. 
However, the hyper-explicit depiction of rape in “reduced circumstances,” as Offred/June herself put it in the episode, wasn’t the end of viewers’ disgust. A later scene further tugged at viewers’ heartstrings when June finally reunited with her biological daughter Hannah, only to have the young girl violently ripped from her arms 10 minutes later. 
Each episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale” feels at once like a warning and a call to arms; in this sense, the 10th episode comes at an appropriate time in our political atmosphere. 
In light of recent events surrounding undocumented families being forcibly separated at the Mexican border, watching the pain written across June’s face as Hannah is taken from her arms hits a little too close to home. 
Obviously, these moments, including the numerous rape scenes, make the show extremely uncomfortable to watch. But at what point have we crossed the line from empathy to exploitation?
Yahlin Chang, one of the episode’s writers, defends the show’s storytelling. “It’s really wrong to rip children away from their mothers, and it’s really wrong to rape people. With this particular episode, I think, those are two messages I would like to hammer home,” Chang explained in an interview with Digital Spy.
Overall,  the series’ impact doesn’t come from its entertainment value; rather, its value lies in its lack of hesitance in bringing a seemingly distant reality the immediacy it deserves,  highlighting the fact that similar tragedies are being inflicted on women somewhere in the real world. 
In addition, like “The Handmaid’s Tale” author Margaret Atwood once said, there is “nothing in the book that didn’t happen somewhere.”
Yes, “The Handmaid’s Tale” is uncomfortable to watch, considering its parallelism to the real world. However, the showrunners wouldn’t be doing their job if their intention was to make people complacent to pervasive issues like sexual assault and the forced separation of families. Whether in Gilead or an  I.C.E. detention center, “The Handmaid’s Tale” warns against authoritarian regimes, emphasizing how the weight of the burden falls upon women more than often. 
While not every aspect of the fictional Gilead may be our immediate reality in the United States, the show does illustrate a harsh world that many women live through every day. What is noteworthy about “The Handmaid’s Tale,” above all, is that the show refuses to raise the question of right or wrong — rather, it forces viewers to edges of their seat, questioning their empathy as well as their politics. 
In placing motherhood at the center of its storyline, “The Handmaid’s Tale” emphasizes that the personal is politics, and always will be. Upon witnessing the traumatic visuals of the show, viewers are left with a challenge: Remain complacent or join the fight.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the 10th episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale” was also the finale. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

According to Joy Kim, the curator for the USC Korean Heritage Library, the USC Peace Corps Korea digital archive contains photographs and diaries from volunteers to record the critical 15-year period. (Photo courtesy of Joonhee Lee).
The USC Korean Heritage Library hosted the Legacy of Peace Corps Korea event at Doheny Memorial Library last Wednesday. The event was held to discuss the creation of the library’s Peace Corps Korea digital archive and current events happening in the region. 
Former Peace Corps Korea members, who volunteered from 1966 and 1981, and those of the USC community gathered at the library for lunch, listened to lectures on Korean geopolitics and attended a reception.
Joy Kim, the curator for the USC Korean Heritage Library,  spoke at the event, discussing the role of the American Peace Corps volunteers and how they shaped South Korea into what it is today. Kim also discussed her own experiences with the Peace Corps volunteers from when she was a child growing up in Korea, and how it affected the way she perceived the USC Korean community and culture. 
“Between 1966 and 1981, more than 2,000 Americans served in Korea as Peace Corps volunteers,” Kim said. “Living in rural and urban community across the country, they learned the Korean language and participated in Korean life on a broader and deeper level than any other group of Americans before . . .  I am convinced that many of those educated, inspired, and touched by [Peace Corps Korea] volunteers became leaders who shaped the development of Korea into what it is today.”
After Kim gave her introductory speech, USC librarian Rachel Mandell spoke about the process of preserving materials from that historical time period and placing it into a digital format. Ken Klein, the head of the East Asian Library, then presented a lecture on how the materials had been collected, as well as the future development of the Peace Corps Korea digital archive. 
Finally, USC Korean Studies Institute Director David Kang discussed the relations between North Korea and South Korea, emphasizing the United States’ historically biased view of the communist country. According to Kang, diplomacy, rather than aggression or economic isolation, remains crucial in North Korea’s reformation.
“North Korea is not a problem to be solved . . . there is no possible combination of sticks and carrots . . . that will make North Korea denuclearize, disarm, become a capitalist economy, stop the human rights abuses and open up the prisons,” Kang said. “That is not happening. North Korea is a country we have to live with.” 
Kang argued that North Korea has had a long-term strategy of “slow-motion nuclearization” designed to encourage America to improve its relationship, in exchange for partial denuclearization. According to Kang, China and South Korea are also in favor of pursuing better relations with North Korea through diplomacy. 
“Whether you care about North Korea’s security situation, whether you care about the horrific human rights situation or whether you care about opening up the economy to capitalism and the American way, the debate coheres around one key question,” Kang said. “Do we hit them with a stick or do we engage them?” 
At the end of his lecture, Kang criticized the American news media’s tendency to evaluate geopolitical events through the lens of their effect on American power, which is how he characterized many of the reactions to the United States-North Korea summit that took place in Singapore in June.
Former Peace Corps Korea volunteers and attendees Michael Travis and Dan Strickland generally agreed with Kang’s arguments.
“I found [Dr. Kang’s talk] to be a very refreshing presentation because that’s not what we hear in the American media,” said Travis, who taught English to middle and high school students in South Korea. 
The two former volunteers took a long view of Korean history and were critical of America’s involvement on the Korean Peninsula, citing the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910, which allowed Japan to freely colonize Korea; America’s failure to unify the Koreas after World War II; and the Korean War. However, Strickland is hopeful moving forward.
 “The U.S. has a very difficult time accepting a role on the periphery and not being central to what’s going on,” said Strickland, who worked at a Korean health center testing for and treating tuberculosis. “To my mind, the genius of [South Korean] President Moon’s diplomacy is that he has shuffled [United States President] Trump to the side.”
Beyond political discussion, the event served to honor and reunite Peace Corps Korea members. Kim believes that preserving these stories can provide  insight into Korean culture and, specifically the factors that allowed South Korea to develop rapidly in the decades following the Korean War.

USC alumna Krista Tucker will serve as the story editor of Disney Junior’s upcoming animated series “Fancy Nancy.” The show is based on Jane O’Connor’s children’s picture book by the same name. 
Krista Tucker’s other writing credits include “Doc McStuffins” and “Sofia the First.” (Photo courtesy of DisneyJunior/Matt Petit)
“‘Fancy Nancy’ is ultimately about imagination, that you can wake up in the morning and say ‘I want to be this, I’m [going to] try this out,’ particularly when you’re a young person,” the executive producer of “Fancy Nancy” Jamie Mitchell said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Nancy is a character who on any given day makes a decision to be something extraordinary or different, which makes her a very likable, engaging, and aspirational character.” 
Tucker said she hopes to deliver a heroine who stays true to the dauntless and imaginative Fancy Nancy, while offering viewers a fresh perspective on females. Inspired by the title character’s defiance of social norms, Tucker hopes the series will encourage its young audiences to live boldly. 
“We use the book series as a jumping off point and as inspiration for our show. Because ‘Fancy Nancy’ is an animated television series, it allows us to go further with our characters and tell more in-depth stories,” Tucker said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “My vision for the series is that it will entertain our viewers while encouraging them to celebrate their uniqueness. We hope they’ll find their own expression of what it means to be fancy.” 
Like Nancy, Tucker also explored various career paths that captured her interest. Despite being a screenwriter, Tucker graduated from USC with a degree in theatre. While auditioning for different roles, she realized many of the typical female cast types focused on appearance rather than inner substance. Tucker later wrote plays to craft her own characters, especially non-stereotypical female leads, to inspire her audience.
“After graduating I became frustrated with the female roles I was auditioning for… [I wrote] to create juicier characters for me to perform,” Tucker said. “This was when I fell in love with writing … and the rest is history!”
Although Tucker is no longer involved with theater or dance, she continues to apply the skills she learned at USC as a screenwriter.  She urges USC students to harvest opportunities by showing diligence and seeking out mentors to aid their personal and professional success. 
“The wonderful theater program helped me learn all about the craft of acting, which I use every day when I write. I learned how to create great characters and make them emotionally real,” Tucker said. “Nothing takes the place of perseverance and hard work. Connections will get you in the door, but you need to have something to offer once an opportunity arrives.”
Despite the pressure she has faced as a story editor for the upcoming production, Tucker expressed gratitudefor her work. Similar to Nancy, Tucker wants the story she writes to spark creativity and imagination.
“Trust your gut and write, write, write! Don’t be afraid to ‘kill your darlings.’ More darlings always show up, I promise,” Tucker said. “It’s rewarding when a story works and has my co-workers laughing at our table read. Then I know we’ve got something good!”
The series is slated for premiere on July 13 on Disney Junior, DisneyNow and Disney Junior VOD.

A ProPublica study released on Thursday found that more than 1,200 civil rights investigations were scuttled by the U.S. Department of Education under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. 
Along with the report, the status of resolved and pending civil right cases from 2015 to 2018 for different school districts and colleges has been released to the public.  According to ProPublica, 46 cases were filed against USC, and were subsequently resolved in the last three years.
Although several filed complaints dealt with discriminatory discipline and sexual violence in school districts and universities across the United States, they were closed without the proper investigations and consequences due to insufficient evidence. 
“This is indicative of how they are now evaluating and handling complaints,” senior attorney with the Advancement Project Kaitlin Banner said to ProPublica.
ProPublica also discovered that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has become more lenient under DeVos’ leadership. The study compared the first 15 months of resolved cases under the Trump administration to the last 15 months of Obama’s presidency. 
The results concluded that under Obama, 51 percent of the cases took more than 180 days to investigate while the rate of the findings of civil rights violations decreased to 35 percent under Trump.  
Specific cases have reflected this pattern of decrease in finding proper closure. According to the study, complaints regarding the discrimination against non-native English speakers were at 70 percent under Obama while 52 percent were upheld by Trump. In addition, complaints regarding sexual harassment and violence dropped from 41 percent to 31 percent, while racial harassment complaints decreased from 31 percent to 21 percent. 
“Where the evidence is insufficient for OCR to prove a violation of law, or the facts show that dismissal is appropriate on other grounds, OCR closes the case, which provides much-needed closure for both students and institutions,” spokeswoman for the Department of Education Elizabeth Hill said. 
ProPublica also analyzed differences between how each administration dealt with civil rights enforcement. While Obama’s administration prioritized carrying out cases to undergo systematic investigations, Trump’s leadership has  emphasized efficiency. 
Due to its varied methods of investigation, the Trump administration has resolved an estimated 3,250 cases that each lasted more than six months while only 1,150 were resolved in the last 15 months under Obama’s presidency. 
“If all you see when you get a complaint is one kid and one dispute with a school, you will be able to resolve that — and maybe even in the kid’s favor — pretty quickly, but you are focusing on the needles and not the haystacks,” former senior official in the OCR Seth Galanter said. “The way they are approaching it is they are only dealing with the squeaky wheel. They aren’t doing their full job, which means they can move quickly.”
Although the percentage of investigation lengths is lower under DeVos’ leadership, the actual number of cases that were concluded with wrongdoings has significantly increased compared to Obama’s administration.
