In the #MeToo era, it’s a safe assumption that the waves of allegations against powerful men and women who have used their influence to wrongly manipulate others would be enough to convince the U.S. government to take action.
Unfortunately, it’s not the kind of action we need.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is preparing new legislation that promises to revise the way colleges deal with cases of sexual assault and misconduct. The proposed legislation, which was obtained by The New York Times, plans to narrow the definition of sexual harassment, require a greater burden of proof, mandate a lesser obligation for institutions to investigate assault complaints and increase the rights of the accused. However, these changes are ill-intentioned.
Perhaps one of the most damaging changes that DeVos has made to the Obama-era guidelines is the proposed increase of mediation tactics in cases of accusations. DeVos firmly believes that mediation is a positive tool to help resolve these issues. While this may be true in a vacuum, her new policy would actually give accused perpetrators more power. 
Under the proposed changes, the perpetrator and the victim will have the ability to directly ask for evidence from one another and give direct cross-examinations. Allowing a perpetrator to directly cross-examine a victim is an inhumane and unnecessary course of action. This would potentially result in a confrontational, humiliating and traumatizing experience for the victim. Mediation on its own can be a good thing, but when it comes to the intense power dynamics at play in cases of assault, direct mediation could be detrimental. 
It is obvious that DeVos’ attempt to reform campus assault legislation is not meant to curb or end the problem, but rather to ensure safety for those accused. Sadly, DeVos is not alone in this sentiment.
Over one year ago, news of a woman who falsely accused two Sacred Heart University football players of rape made headlines. One of the two men lost his scholarship and both withdrew from school due to the media and legal frenzy surrounding the unfortunate trial. In the wake of this case, DeVos and others have called for more rights and protections for the accused.
And while this case was used to discredit and delegitimize the #MeToo movement — which was at a viral, all-time high in late 2017 — it does not illustrate a common occurrence.
A study from psychologist David Lisak found that around 6 percent of campus sexual assault reports were deemed false, and that the rate of false accusations is between 2 and 10 percent. Moreover, about 2 percent of all rape charges are determined false — the same rate of false reporting for other crimes. 
And yet, during an interview on “60 Minutes” in March, DeVos was asked whether or not there are a higher amount of false accusations or campus rapes. She simply answered: “I don’t know.” 
There is no denying that false allegations occur, but having a warped understanding of how big the problem is and using this misunderstanding to justify protecting those who are accused will undoubtedly perpetuate campus assault culture. Fewer victims are likely to come forward if they know that they will have to directly mediate with their assaulters. 
DeVos’ plans are a deterrent. Her legislation will further deepen the culture of silence on our college campuses. 
And yet, DeVos’ plan also includes legislation that encourages more support for victims who choose to forego writing a formal complaint. The government will not penalize institutions that choose to allow more counseling, extended work deadlines, class scheduling changes and leaves of absences for victims. These foreseeable positive aspects of DeVos’ legislation appear to give more institutional support to victims. 
Many of these changes can simply be seen as a way to incentivize informal complaints and a way to disincentivize formal complaints against the accused. Whatever it may be, the newly drafted policies come at an especially relevant and volatile time, as many colleges, including USC, are dealing with sexual assault and abuse charges among faculty and students, alike. 
We must do whatever we can to end the culture of silence and victim blaming on campuses. Increasing rights for the accused and increasing the potential humiliation and trauma that comes with cases of assault is not the way to do this. 
DeVos must revise her new legislation to eliminate the mediation mandate. Instead of focusing on the trials that come after the fact, the Department of Education should be focused on addressing the root causes of why these trials happen in the first place. Preventative measures and increased education will be more effective than inadequate legislation that protects the accused rather than the victims.

A great man once said, “If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.”
In the post-game press conference after an embarrassing 17-3 defeat at the hands of Stanford, USC offensive coordinator Tee Martin pulled out his best Vince Vaughn impression, dodging questions and shirking responsibility regarding USC’s offensive impotency. 
When asked why sophomore running back Stephen Carr and freshman wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown didn’t get more touches, Martin — after claiming that both Carr and St. Brown played a lot of snaps — responded with an at-fault coach’s all-time classic and sports version of the Fifth Amendment: “Next question.”
Pleading the Fifth protects those in the court of law from self-incrimination. But, in the court of the Trojan football, “next question” is as useful as a third-down screenplay to redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai — two things Martin is quite familiar with.
Anyone could tell that Martin knew his lackluster play-calling cost the Trojans the game but was masking his guilt by avoiding the question.
Trojan football will most likely fall short of the 2018 Pac-12 title, but it’s not because of a lack of talent. 
It is because of a lack of coaching.
For St. Brown, who caught seven passes for 98 yards and a touchdown just a week ago against UNLV, to go an entire half without a single target is simply ridiculous.
For Martin to ignore arguably the best USC receiver in years for a full half would be a fireable offense at other programs. 
USC has the talent at every single position to light up opposing defenses, yet the Trojans turned the ball over three times and failed to execute on third down.
Martin claimed that it was a lack of execution that lost the Trojans the game, when, in fact, it was a complete lack of preparation and inconsistent offensive strategy that did the Trojans in. 
It seemed that sophomore wide receiver Tyler Vaughns was the only reliable receiver on USC’s roster because he ran the easiest routes possible.
Vaughns is talented, but he should not be the be-all and end-all for the Trojan offense when there’s such a plethora of other talented receivers available. 
On multiple occasions, Martin ran poor plays when the Trojans needed big ones.
While the Vaughns curl route was working for short yardage gains, Martin refused to dial up enough long routes to stretch the field vertically. 
Stanford demolished USC’s secondary by throwing all over the middle of the field to their physical tight ends. 
And although a couple of drops by senior tight end Tyler Petite and underthrown passes from freshman quarterback JT Daniels were not in Martin’s control, the lack of consistent strategy from the Trojan coaching staff is concerning. 
There’s not much you can do when your quarterback injures his throwing hand. But, when the offensive line — which came into that game with multiple guys not at their peaks — opened up holes left and right for ’SC running backs, there has to be questions regarding the decisions behind these plays.
Aside from a poor first-quarter drive where the defense allowed 39 yards to Bryce Love, including a seven-yard touchdown scamper, defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast kept a dangerous Cardinal offense at bay for a majority of the game. The defense did its job and more on Saturday, and was rewarded with the worst offensive performance by a USC team in over 20 years. 
Some may argue that the road environment at Stanford Stadium makes it hard for any team to pull out a victory. And while that may be true, it’s still unacceptable that a Trojan defense could hold a Cardinal offense to just 3 second-half points and still lose the game because of an offense that didn’t know what it was doing.
This week’s game against Texas will be yet another tough road test that will reveal whether or not this USC ballclub is ready for the postseason. 
Martin, who assumed full control of the play calling from Helton this season, will have to change everything from this past week or risk yet another lost USC season. 
If you asked me on the stand whether or not Martin deserves to be USC’s offensive coordinator after last week’s performance, I’d plead the Fifth.

Redshirt sophomore midfielder Savannah DeMelo recorded two shots on net in each game over the weekend. (Tal Volk | Daily Trojan)
The women’s soccer team remained undefeated after claiming two hard-earned victories against Missouri and San Diego over the weekend.
The Trojans faced the Tigers on Friday and claimed a 2-0 victory. The Women of Troy had a number of shots in the first half, but were only able to find the back of the net  courtesy of redshirt sophomore attacking midfielder Savannah DeMelo. The Trojans continued to push on in the second half with a number of shots, and managed to score from a beautiful chip by junior defensive midfielder Jalen Woodward from a corner kick.
Woodward linked play from the back to the midfield seamlessly and won just about every 50-50 ball she faced on defense against the Tigers.
“Really, I’m more of a defensive minded player. So that’s my first job and my first priority,” Woodward said. “But I think that in games like this it allows me space and time to get forward in those opportunities and moments when we do have cover and get the ball forward. I can get in on the attack as well.”
While the Trojans contained most of the possession throughout the game, they had difficulty breaking down Missouri’s defense. The Tigers were playing extremely deep with five defenders and two defensive midfielders behind the ball. Missouri did not look to attack the Trojans at all, instead, it looked to contain USC’s high-powered offense. Missouri’s “park the bus” tactics proved difficult for the Trojans at times, as they were having trouble creating space to have faster, more dangerous movement for most of the game. While they created a lot of shots and opportunities, many of them weren’t from excellent spots in the box.
“We just have to play faster and move the ball faster,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We have to force teams to come out and defend us. And at moments we did that. We moved the ball well, we were aggressive and we were assertive. We kept them moving and trying to find us and it was great. But then we slowed our tempo throughout the game and allowed them sometimes to feel confident about themselves, so that’s the frustration.”
On Sunday, the Women of Troy had a tough time against San Diego, coming back twice to claim the victory at home. The Trojans started down 1-0 after 10 minutes of play, conceding for the first time in over 440 minutes of play. Redshirt junior forward Natalie Jacobs soon came to the rescue, scoring a header from a cross from sophomore forward Tara McKeown. The Trojans then scored another goal six minutes later to cut the lead to 2-1. However, freshman forward Penelope Hocking beat the keeper after a nice long through ball from senior defender Ally Prisock to level the score 2-2 at halftime.
The Trojans were more composed in the second half and eventually claimed the victory courtesy of senior forward Leah Pruitt. Pruitt started the play by sending a nice through ball to Hocking from around the halfway line. She then quickly darted into the penalty box and found the back of the net from a cross by Hocking. It was a great heads-up play by the senior which was rewarded with a goal. Her hustle and great positional sense proved to be the decisive factor for the Trojans against USD as they claimed a narrow 3-2 victory.
The Trojans will look to remain undefeated as they take on Long Beach State in their next two matchups this weekend.
