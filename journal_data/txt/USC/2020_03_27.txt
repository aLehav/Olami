USC athletic director Mike Bohn detailed the athletic department’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and the cancellation of spring sports in a letter sent to fans Friday.
“In the two weeks since our world suddenly halted, our athletic department has been singularly focused on the student-athletes whom we are unequivocally committed to serving,” the letter read. “As we face our new reality together, our attention has shifted to operational continuity during this extended remote period.”
Bohn said the department has kept in contact with USC’s head coaches and student-athletes and that it has created procedures for them to maintain communication with each other, including weekly virtual team meetings. Bohn said that out of USC’s more than 600 student-athletes, only seven remain on campus, all of whom are under the protection of University and athletics staff. All other student-athletes have been surveyed about updated whereabouts, travel plans, emergency contacts and any needs for assistance, according to the letter.
Bohn said the athletic department has created a team of 14 members to lead the new Remote Athletics Management Model that deals with student-athlete issues such as mental health, medicine, academics and compliance. He also wrote that all of USC’s sports psychology and counseling services are continuing and have moved to a virtual platform. 
“We have in-person crisis services still available on campus for any student-athletes currently in the greater Los Angeles area who may need dedicated support,” the letter read. “We are sending out regular communications on Coping and Wellness and will be hosting a series of virtual Mindfulness Sessions for our student-athletes as we prioritize maintaining connectedness.”
USC’s athletic medicine staff and team physicians are working with the school’s health and hospital staff to provide support for any student-athlete with COVID-19 symptoms, according to the letter. He added that no student-athletes have tested positive for the virus.
Bohn wrote that trainers have continued rehab and physical therapy at various locations near student-athletes’ residences and that performance coaches will send all student-athletes workout equipment to go along with specialized home workout programs.
According to the letter, student-athlete academic services are still operating online, and each student-athlete has been provided an academic adviser and learning specialist for frequent check-ins. 
Bohn said that in the fall semester, USC student-athletes put together their highest cumulative GPA in the last 20 years. 
“Maintaining this record-breaking level of achievement is a top priority,” the letter read.
Bohn, who serves on USC’s COVID-19 task force, praised USC — including President Carol Folt, Provost Chip Zukoski and Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman — for their response to the coronavirus.
“This pandemic is so much greater than sports,” Bohn wrote. “As members of the USC community, I want to assure you that the comprehensive response … has been as masterful and inspirational as anything I’ve experienced in 35+ years as an administrator. During a truly extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime event, I feel deeply fortunate to be guided by the steady hand and resolute leadership of President Folt and her team of trusted advisors and partners.”
Bohn also encouraged fans to email him letters of support for USC’s student-athletes and said he will share some on his social media. 
“As we assess the severe economic impacts on our program as a result of the pandemic, my primary request at this time is for you to show your love and support of our student-athletes and demonstrate the combined power of the Trojan Family,” the letter read. 
Regarding the 2020 football season, Bohn wrote in a different version of the letter sent to ticket holders that season ticket renewal has been extended to May 13, and the next installment processing for those currently on season ticket payment plans will be delayed until July 24.
Bohn said that the 2020 football season and the question of extended eligibility for spring athletes still leave many unanswered questions, and the Pac-12 as well as the NCAA are working together to gain a better sense of the situations moving forward. Bohn said all athletic directors in the Pac-12 hold a conference call with Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott each morning to discuss issues related to the coronavirus.
“My hope is that as we successfully flatten the curve over the next few weeks, we will gain clearer visibility into the timeline for returning to normalcy,” Bohn wrote. 
Bohn encouraged fans to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“As the preeminent program in the largest market in the world for intercollegiate athletics, it is my hope that we can be a leader in setting the social distancing standard for the rest of the nation,” Bohn wrote. “All of us in the Trojan Family are counting on each other to do our part in defeating our newest opponent, COVID-19.”

What felt like the last major sporting event to survive the coronavirus scourge finally fell to what has seemed for weeks like an inevitable fate. On Tuesday, the International Olympic Committee  finally announced that the Summer Olympics in Tokyo would be postponed by approximately one year. 
In my last column, I wrote about the speculation surrounding the potential cancellation of the upcoming Olympics. Even after March 11, when the World Health Organization designated the coronavirus a world pandemic, the IOC still maintained that it would wait until the end of May to make an official decision. 
Clearly, that’s not the case anymore. 
The IOC did everyone a favor by postponing the Olympics. 
The virus’s spread doesn’t appear to be slowing anytime soon and it certainly doesn’t appear that holding a large gathering of thousands of fans from all over the world in the most populated city on the planet is a great idea. Starting the Olympics as scheduled would have turned the city into a virtual feeding frenzy for the virus. 
From athletes to staff to fans, continuing the Olympics would have put thousands — if not tens or hundreds of thousands — of lives at risk by potentially exposing them to the coronavirus.
Still, despite the postponement’s obvious justifications, it is disappointing to see how long it took for the world to acknowledge just how serious COVID-19 is.
Almost two months ago, the United States reported its first case of the coronavirus, but for most Americans, the threat of a potential pandemic remained an afterthought. This ambivalence has led to predictably disastrous results, and the U.S. is now quickly becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 100,000 cases — the most of any country on the planet. 
President Donald Trump recently released a statement saying how he expects everything to return to normal by Easter. Considering the unrelenting spread of the virus, this seems virtually impossible, nevermind irresponsible. In light of this public display of incompetence, the IOC’s decision appears even more reassuring.
Postponing the Olympics also sends a message to governments and politicians around the world. If they didn’t take it seriously before, if they still think the virus will pass without affecting them, perhaps the postponement of one of the biggest international events in the world — which had previously only ever been postponed or canceled due to world wars — will get their attention. 
Lastly, if postponing the Olympics sends any message at all, hopefully it’s to the countless Americans that still don’t seem to be getting the memo. Across the country, people seem to be taking the cancellation of school and public life as we know it as an excuse to head outside and enjoy themselves, often with no acknowledgment of the recommended six feet of distance between each other that experts recommend. 
Everyone, please wake up to the IOC’s message and take this seriously. The faster you do, the faster the Olympics will be back.

USC’s acceptance rate has increased to 16% for the Class of 2024, increasing from 11% in 2019 and marking the first rise in admissions rates since 2012. 
Of the 60,000 applicants that applied in the 2020 cycle, 9,500 were offered admission. The average unweighted GPA of the applicant group is 3.88.
First-generation students make up 17% of the incoming class, increasing by two percentage points compared to 2019’s admissions. Underrepresented minority groups comprise 29% of the admitted class, a slight .5% decrease from last year. 
International students composed 14% of those offered admission in the Class of 2024, and domestic fall admits came from all 50 states, in addition to the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories. California applicants represent 40% of the admitted class, a four-point increase from 2019.
Other universities across the country, including the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University, are also seeing increased acceptance rates for the Class of 2024 as universities increase the number of students admitted to mitigate the impact the coronavirus will likely have on acceptances as students navigate financial and educational shifts. 
Students will have until May 1 to commit to USC despite the cancellation of all campus tours and admissions events through May 3.
