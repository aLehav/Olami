Alok Vaid-Menon blew into the microphone. The two poets combined an intoxicating rustle with a subtle whistle through the loop station. They added layer after layer of subtle sounds that became water crashing on shore. The audience remained silent in awe as they created a painting with their lips. They lifted their hand from the loop station and proclaimed the refrain. 
“Where do all the sad girls go?” they said. 
Vaid-Menon continued with the poem dedicated to sad people. They remarked that sad people shouldn’t fear their sadness, and instead embrace it.
Alok Vaid-Menon and Janani Balasubramanian, a trans-South Asian performance duo called DarkMatter, performed their poetry and prose in Doheny with Visions and Voices Thursday night. They covered the topics pertaining to the LGBT community, racism, discrimination and human inquiry that the poets face in their everyday lives. 
Before the event began, snippets of Teletubbies, The Magic School Bus and Bollywood movies illuminated the screen behind the stage while EDM music blasted from the speakers. This set the mood for a night of witty, metaphorical and controversial performances. 
Vaid-Menon and Balasubramanian walked on stage and began with a poem describing their views on the world. They described their experiences and thoughts about violence of queer trans of color and gender norms while also commenting on the stereotypes portrayed in mainstream gay rights activism. Vaid-Menon and Balasubramanian spoke as one voice, each of them responding immediately after the other, creating a single coherent thought. 
They were in sync, and when the poem ended, their entities separated as they casually spoke to the audience about what was on their mind. Vaid-Menon’s thoughts were witty and impactful while Balasubramanian’s thoughts were thought-provoking and contemplative. 
Balasubramanian described the science fiction book they recently read. It brought up ideas of sight and how, as an activist, they should look at the world around them. They ended their train of thought by remarking people should surround themselves with people who inspire them. 
Vaid-Menon recalled their time in Melbourne, Australia where they encountered homophobia taking public transportation. They fell on a “rugby jock,” as Vaid-Menon described him, apologized and stood back up. The man punched them despite the apology. They remembered how trans people get attacked like this, and worse, everyday just for existing. Anyone could kill them at any moment, so they remain silent. 
Vaid-Menon remembered being told: 
“I’m okay with gay people, but you’re just too much.” 
They used this discrimination to introduce their first poem. They had it dedicated to a girl named Aubrey, a transgender woman who committed suicide by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge. Aubrey left a suicide noted that contained a single sentence that inspired their poem: 
“What is the point of living if I’m going to be killed anyway.” 
The poem brought attention to LGBT suicides. Vaid-Menon understood that LGBT youth suicides were discussed in society, but no one advocates to prevent suicides of LGBT adults. They talked about how the ideology of “It Gets Better” is false. People tell trans youth that it will be okay in the future when they are surrounded by maturity, but Vaid-Menon found this to be a lie. Transgenders literally wear their identity, and discrimination persists through the establishment of social norms in society. 
“I am in pain not because of the accident, but because of the norm,” Vaid-Manon said in the poem. “She is dead not because of the accident, but because of the norm.” 
The tone switched when the duo performed a poem about how they are obsessed and “turned-on” by white people despite their annoyance with white privilege. They continued with more serio-comic poems, tackling issues about immigration, Black Lives Matter, sexuality and individuality through the lenses of Harry Potter and Nursery Rhymes. 
Afterwards, Vaid-Menon brought the audience in with hypnotic performances fabricated by the use of a loop station. They brought up topics about the validity of being trans, reminding the audience that they own their body. 
At the end of Vaid-Menon’s last poem, Balasubramanian introduced their commentary on art and the universe. They talked about Schrödinger’s Cat, a theory about the outcome of placing a cat in a confined space with a radioactive source and a poison. They talked about how there are infinite amount of outcomes and each outcome occurs in different universes. In one universe the cat dies and in another the cat lives. 
Balasubramanian related this idea to art. Artists create things with their imagination, but they believe that instead of their ideas originating from nothing, it actually originates from a different universe. This introduced their poetry and prose that pondered these ideas. 
At the end of the performance, the audience was enlightened of the infinite universes and the troubling and discriminative universe we live in. By speaking about these issue, DarkMatter initiated the conversation about the world around us, and allowed the audience to question social norms. More importantly, they showed support for the minorities in the community which they represented. 
“Recognize that your identity, your life, your struggle, your desire are not just valid, they are incredibly wonderful,” Vaid-Menon said.

In the months leading up to college, I subconsciously began forming expectations for what college life would be like. With each day college approached, my expectations grew higher.
Simply put, I expected college to be fun and full with new experiences. I had completely disregarded the actual academic “school” part of college.  
My expectations led me to picture the college experience with lively events, exploring Los Angeles, and spending time with new friends. Failure, struggles, and trauma did not exist in the picture. However, after experiencing college for half a semester, I now realize that it does not live up to the expectations I had built. 
First of all, classes are much harder than I had prepared myself for. Maybe I had gotten too used to senioritis and the senior year attitude, but I forgot how difficult keeping up with schoolwork would be in college. In just the first few weeks of classes, I was already drowning in assignments from professors and I didn’t know how to handle it.
Aside from professors’ difficult and arbitrary grading, the schoolwork has also been overwhelming to a point I have not experienced before. The sheer amount of work and time I would have to spend doing schoolwork was something I had not considered before coming to college. But then again, why didn’t I? Why did I think that the hard work and stress of school would end after high school?
We all have this surreal idea that college is the place of our dreams, full of fun and games, because we have only heard about the good times college brings without ever considering the other side of the spectrum. After all, college is really just another institution of education and schooling. My mind was not prepared to take on the fast-paced, strenuous, and hard work of college classes. 
Another reality of college is that as a freshman, I don’t get to go off campus as much as I thought I would. I actually spend a majority — if not all — of my time on campus or in my dorm. Part of this reality is due to the amount of schoolwork that I had not considered, but another part of it is the lack of transportation. 
As a freshman living in a residential college, opportunities to venture off campus are small without the convenience of a car. Yes, the metro and Uber are sufficient modes of transportation within Los Angeles, but public transportation can’t compare to the benefits of owning a car. 
Because college has not fully lived up to my initial definition of fun, I do not feel like I’ve been fully enjoying my time in college. Recognizing the expectations I had held for my college experience has made me self-aware in becoming more open-minded to experimenting ways college can be enjoyable for me outside of my preconceived standards. 
After experiencing the realities of college these past few weeks, I wonder why I had ever formed expectations for my college experience in the first place. Even though we all know very well that expectations almost always lead to disappointment, we can’t help but subconsciously imagine what is in store for us in the future. 
The college experience should not be held to a certain standard because everyone experiences it in different ways. Our expectations restrict us from being open-minded and viewing college from diverse perspectives. Fun should not be defined only in terms of going off campus, but rather in ways you can enjoy your time here and truly be happy with yourself.

Breaking news: It rained on Monday! 
Granted, it wasn’t a downpour or even a storm, but there were clouds and a drizzle, so it counts. It’s always been funny to me that as soon as one drop of rain hits the USC campus, students scatter. There is often a spike in absences that day (myself included). It’s as if most of the local students have never experienced an overcast weather situation before. Throughout my four years here, I guess that mentality has rubbed off on me.
The weather is taking a turn to the colder side right as Halloween is upon us. And with a little over a week until the holiday comes, if you haven’t already thought of a costume to wear, here are some to AVOID and for good reason.
KIM KARDASHIAN ROBBERY VICTIM COSTUME
Unless you live in a pineapple under the sea, you already know about the near-death robbery that Kim Kardashian experienced in Paris. The costume comes complete with a fake 4 million-dollar wedding ring, a bathrobe, a long black wig, and various rope and handcuff paraphernalia. I was in shock when I saw this costume was actually for sale —  let alone for nearly $70. Although I have mixed feelings about the entire Kardashian/Jenner squad, one thing that should not be debated is that what happened to this woman is not acceptable, nor is a recreation of her experience in the form of a cheap costume for mockery. 
ANY SORT OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION / RELIGIOUS COSTUME
Despite the outrage so many people have expressed toward racist costumes, large companies such as Spirit continue to manufacture them. From “Tribal Trouble Indian” to “Naughty Nun” to “Sexy Chinese Take Out” (These are actual names of costumes, you guys!) — and the list goes on. Culture is not a costume, and the same applies to religion. I can tell you that my house will not be giving out candy to people dressed in any suspect attire. #staywoke 
THE DOWNRIGHT SEXIST
As a woman, these costumes are particularly offensive. We are all too familiar with the sexualization of every single occupation when Halloween rolls around. Whether it’s the scantily-clad nurse, the cop wearing booty shorts, or the teacher who looks like she came straight out of a porn film. While browsing costume sites for inspiration for this article, I even came across a sexualized minion costume! Come on guys…really. SMH. The reason these costumes become offensive are because women already face inequalities in the workplace and in the real world. When so many of these real-world occupations are made into farcical stripper-esque costumes, these inequalities are highlighted even more. And while there are many steps in between, these explicit dress-up outfits don’t help the cause for women to be taken seriously.

Now, I’m not saying participating in the raunchy mess that we call Ho-lloween should be looked down upon, but when real world racial and gender issues are being exploited at $24.99, it becomes almost detrimental to society. So if your friend or even you were planning on wearing any of these costumes this year, I encourage you to start a conversation around the problematic culture of costuming so that ignorance can turn into education.
With so many issues of gender inequality, rape culture, violence, and racism still alive and thriving in our world today, the longer people believe that costumes such as these are “harmless” or “innocent,” the longer people will be ignorant to these truly controversial issues that contribute to society’s messed-up state of mind.

Sometimes the past is not really the past. I learned this lesson last weekend. 
I decided to go home for the weekend because my friend was in town and we had made plans to go to our favorite event of the year: Halloween Horror Nights (HHN). Since the beginning of high school, we had gone together. 
I was so excited when I entered through the gates into the park. I took one step into the park and felt this feeling of nostalgia take over. 
I thought, “I’m home, I’m finally back- it’s been too long”. 
We started walking around and my friend said, “Check Snapchat, ________ is here.” 
I responded with, “Oh yeah, she’s still in high school.” 
I thought nothing of the Snapchat, I thought it was not important. Then, out of nowhere, the aforementioned girl appeared and attacked my friend with hugs. It was so surreal and weird. We shared those awkward pleasantries one does with an acquaintance and then we headed on our own way. It would not be the first encounter like that of the night. 
We ran into a group of juniors from my high school who I worked with on the student newspaper who I genuinely knew and liked. That was another reminder of high school. Everyone around me started to seem so young and small. I no longer felt nostalgic, but like I was watching a recording from the past. 
When I got into line for the main attraction, the American Horror maze, it, ironically, was ruined by me repeatedly running into someone from my high school who I thought was long gone from my life. Unfortunately, this person brings up memories from my past I do not want to relive or think about it. 
My friends and I kept trying to avoid the inevitable acknowledgment of her but eventually we did, and it was fine. I did not enjoy it, but I realized it all seemed so trivial. The rest of the night continued. I slept at my friend’s house and spent the next day and night at my house. It felt so good to shower without shower shoes and sleep in a queen sized bed, not my lofty twin bed!
Anyways, the point of my weekend- and this blog- was the importance of realizing that things will never be the same so (1) I should not try to relive the past and (2) things from my past will continue to haunt me unless I confront them head on. The weekend reminded me of a lot of good times in high school and, unfortunately, bad times as well.
“But will they ever disappear? Did I make a mistake in not leaving Los Angeles? When will new memories replace old ones? Am I ever going to move on with my life?” 
I do not have the answers to these questions. I thought it was all in the past, but it is not. College just started and so it is okay to still have these fond memories of high school. I just want a fresh start and, for now, I have to leave certain things in the past, whether that be HHN or driving past a certain street. Right now, I’m in college and there are so many great opportunities and people to meet. 
I left my home Sunday afternoon with a new haircut; I completely chopped my hair off. I was sad to leave behind my bed and dog, but it was the first time I embraced my new identity and reality: a college student who’s living in the moment and letting the past go.
