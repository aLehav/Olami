In previous games, USC’s sideline looked deflated as the game wore on. But, as kickoff approached Saturday in the 92nd all-time meeting between USC and Notre Dame, the Trojans looked bouncy, jumping in unison like teenagers on the dance floor.
Unfortunately for USC, it was the only part of the night different from other weeks. Halfway through the second half, heads were down once again as Notre Dame cruised to a 31-16 victory Saturday night full of Trojan mistakes in South Bend, Ind.
USC has now lost its last four meetings against Notre Dame and has not won in South Bend since 2011. It’s also the Trojans’ first loss on the road this season.
Junior cornerback Chris Steele gave USC life when he intercepted senior quarterback Jack Coan with 11:25 left in the game. The Trojans proceeded to march down the field for a two-and-a-half minute drive capped off by a rushing touchdown by redshirt sophomore running back Darwin Barlow.
Barlow’s score brought USC within one possession, but the Trojans defense couldn’t get a stop as Notre Dame answered back with a touchdown sealing the victory, making it 31-16.
“We made way too many mistakes against a really, really good football team,” said interim Head Coach Donte Williams in a postgame press conference Saturday. “Whether it was special teams, offense, defense, coaching, we all made mistakes.”
Nine penalties for 65 yards hurt the USC, but it was its offense that struggled, especially with finishing its drives — a similar story of the Trojans’ season. USC scored only 3 points through three quarters, even with three red zone appearances.
A 10-play, 52-yard drive to end the first half concluded with no points after junior quarterback Kedon Slovis failed to stop the clock for a field goal attempt. Then, a 10-play, 56-yard drive to begin the second half ended with no points on the board after sophomore kicker Parker Lewis missed a 42-yard field goal.
The Trojans struggled on their first drive of the game, going 3-and-out quickly. But, on its second offensive possession, USC rolled down the field, setting itself up at the Fighting Irish’s 12-yard-line.
Slovis then threw an interception that was returned by Notre Dame to USC’s 5-yard line, continuing the trend of poor trips in the red zone.
The Trojans struggled on third-downs on both sides of the ball. On offense, they only converted 6 out of 13 third-downs compared to 8 out of 12 conversions for Notre Dame. Coming into Saturday, the Irish had a 3rd-down conversion rate of 34%.
Junior wide receiver Drake London continued his Biletnikoff Award case with 171 yards and 15 receptions in the game — a career-high record. Junior running back Keaontay Ingram had another strong game carrying the ball with 138 yards on 24 carries. Ingram opened the fourth quarter with a rushing touchdown — USC’s first points since 7:29 left in the second quarter.
On the other hand, Notre Dame found comfort with the ball in its hands, scoring on its first three of four drives of the game.
Coming into the game, the Irish averaged 97.3 rushing yards a game — tied for 118th best in the country. Against USC, they ran for 170 yards, including 3 rushing touchdowns, on 41 carries.
Coan tested USC’s cornerbacks and targeted passes toward the sideline. He finished with 189 passing yards for 1 touchdown and an interception, but most of his work was done handing the ball off. Junior running back Kyren Williams had 2 rushing touchdowns for a season-high 138 total yards — his first multi-rushing touchdown game of the season.
Notre Dame lived off of long drives, putting more pressure on the USC offense to match them to give the defense some rest. The Irish began the game with a 13-play drive that ran nearly four and a half minutes ending with a missed field goal. Then an 11-play, 70-yard drive and a 9-play, 75-yard drive in the middle of the second quarter.
Notre Dame punted for the first time in the game with 9:49 left in the third quarter but followed it up with another long drive — 13 plays for 80 yards and a rushing touchdown by Williams.
USC will play Arizona at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum next Saturday at 4 p.m.

Former Sigma Nu Fraternity President Ryan Schiffilea was taken in for questioning by the Los Angeles Police Department last week and is the “main suspect” in the sexual assault reports at Sigma Nu, LAPD confirmed to the Daily Trojan Friday night. 
Schiffilea has not been arrested or charged, according to the LAPD. 
Seven additional reports of drugging and assault were reported to DPS after the email Wednesday night, six at Sigma Nu and one at an undisclosed location.
Since the Wednesday email, rumors had circulated about Schiffilea’s involvement in the allegations. On Friday before the LAPD confirmation, protesters wrote “Ryan Schiffilea rapes” with black and red marker outside Sigma Nu.
On Thursday, an anonymous Sigma Nu member told the Daily Trojan Schiffilea was suspended from the fraternity the day before Wednesday’s communitywide email.
President Carol Folt and acting Vice President for Student Affairs Monique Allard wrote in a communitywide email Friday the University put an individual on interim suspension Tuesday. 
The University could not confirm the suspended student was Schiffilea, citing student privacy laws. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, the Sigma Nu Fraternity Headquarters wrote that Schiffilea’s membership was suspended after they learned of the reports. The suspension will continue “at least until such time as applicable investigations and related proceedings are completed,” according to the email.
