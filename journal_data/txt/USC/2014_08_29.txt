With the 2014 Trojan football team’s first game on the horizon, Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen interviewed Fresno State Collegian sports editor Christopher Livingston to give USC fans a better picture of what to expect in Saturday’s game against the Bulldogs.
 
DT: How are you going to replace former QB Derek Carr, who led the nation in pass yards last year?
Collegian: There is no way to replace Derek Carr. He had one of the best seasons a Fresno State quarterback could have and left the school with 27 school records and 41 conference records.
What the Bulldogs can do, however, is try to balance their approach.
As of right now, head coach Tim DeRuyter has not announced who will start Saturday’s game; in fact, he has said that it will be a game-day decision. However, we will see both junior Brian Burrell, who saw action in five games as Carr’s backup last season, and incoming transfer Brandon Connette on the field this Saturday.
It is definitely a tough decision, and a big void that the Bulldogs will attempt to fill.
 
DT: The 2013 Trojans heard the phrase, “If you have two quarterbacks, you don’t have any,” all too often at the beginning of last season. Do you have confidence that the current quarterback battle between Brian Burrell and Brandon Connette will turn out better than USC’s did?
Collegian: My opinion is that we will see something similar to how the Fresno State running back battle went last year, when we saw a balance of playing time between both Josh Quezada and Marteze Waller. Obviously, with Carr, the Bulldogs had more of an aerial attack and did not use the ground game as much.
Echoing that phrase, this year could be the return of a heavy ground game while the Bulldogs figure out who will be their consistent No. 1 signal caller. Chances are, the season could end with two quarterbacks still rated top of the depth chart. Will we see a total change in the depth chart by the middle of the season? I don’t doubt it.
 
DT: USC beat Fresno State 45-20 in last year’s Las Vegas Bowl to end the season. Do you think that will weigh on the Bulldogs at all?
Collegian: Absolutely not. Fresno State has a new look offensively heading into the season, and even the veteran leadership on the team will not dwell on the loss. USC is by any means a tough opponent, and Fresno State is up to the challenge of facing the Trojans again.
Fresno State has always had a philosophy of “one game at a time.” The loss at Las Vegas was a demoralizing end to an otherwise productive season, but now that it is a new season with a new squad, the focus is to be able to recover and press ahead.
 
DT: Prediction?
Collegian: It will be a tough contest for the Bulldogs, no doubt. Even with “the cream of the crop” on the field, the Las Vegas Bowl turned out to be a sloppy contest for the team. With the season beginning against USC, add the fact that the Bulldogs are debuting a new core on offense, it looks like an uphill battle for Fresno State.
Defensively, the Bulldogs have more experience and are looking to be stronger in that category. With safety Derron Smith and middle linebacker Karl Mickelsen maturing, I do believe that defense will be the strong point for Fresno State this season.
As I said, the Bulldogs are up to the challenge and will not let the sting from a postseason loss get them down. But realistically, this is not the right time to experiment on offense. The question marks that surround the quarterback battle are too large to declare this an absolute victory for the Bulldogs:
Fresno State 17, USC 28.

The Trojan football team is no stranger to controversy.
Last year it was the firing of head coach Lane Kiffin and the departure of beloved interim head coach Ed Orgeron.
Before that it was He Who Must Not Be Named and the improper benefits that led to USC’s sanctions.
This year it’s Josh Shaw and Anthony Brown.
Shaw, the senior cornerback and recently-named co-captain, caused a media firestorm by claiming to have sprained his ankles while rescuing his nephew from drowning. He then left us all dumbfounded when he admitted to making all of it up.
I struggle to understand why he decided to fabricate such a far-fetched heroic story. He could have made any excuse and not brought such national attention to the story.
But Sports Illustrated senior writer Lee Jenkins, who spoke in my class Wednesday night, provided some thoughtful insight. He lamented the fact that many young athletes like Shaw don’t have the right people around them to advise them against rash decisions.
But it’s hard to imagine that there was nobody to advise Shaw otherwise when he has more than 100 teammates surrounding him, as well as a supportive and understanding coaching staff.
At Pac-12 Media Day this summer, junior co-captain and defensive end Leonard Williams harped on the fact that this was the tightest-knit group of players he had every played with.
“This is one of the closest teams I’ve ever played on,” Williams said. “I feel like the biggest part was just that we had to deal with so many coaching changes [last year]. We loved Coach O. We wanted him to be here. … Dealing with that we realized that this really is a job and at the end of the day coaches can come and go but we’re gonna have each other, so that’s how we got so close.”
Williams also sang the praises of the new coaching staff, who he said has been extremely open and helpful to all of the players.
“You can go up to them and talk to them about anything, it doesn’t have to be about football,” Williams said. “If we have a problem off the field we can go to our coach and ask them for advice and help and stuff like that.”
That sounds like exactly what Shaw needed this weekend — a handful of people to be there for him and steer him in the right direction.
On the heels of the news about Shaw, Sarkisian announced that senior running back Anthony Brown had decided to quit the team. Brown posted to multiple social media forums that Sarkisian was a racist.
Though what Williams called “one of the closest team he’s ever played on” might not have saved Shaw or Brown this time, it’s crucial that the Trojans continue to look to each other for support and get closer. They should band together, block out the media (except for this column, of course) and focus on preparing for their opening game against Fresno State this Saturday.
When I really think about it, I don’t think this should be that hard to do.
I might eat these words later if it turns out that Shaw was involved in some sort of criminal activity or that Sarkisian really does hold racist views, but Shaw’s lie and Brown’s allegations barely hold a candle to the controversy Trojans have faced in the past. Though they might be more bizarre, the consequences are far fewer — other than our families, friends and potential employers cracking jokes about this for years to come.
Despite all of the chaos, I doubt that Williams and the rest of the Trojans will step onto the field on Saturday afternoon thinking about their teammates’ follies.
Hopefully they will be thinking about giving their all each and every play. Hopefully they will be thinking about beating the Bulldogs.
Like senior co-captain and linebacker Hayes Pullard said after practice on Wednesday, “The game is played between the lines.”
The Trojans learned how to keep their focus on the field the hard way last year, somehow making a run for the Pac-12 South title despite the multiple coaching changes they endured.
I believe they can do it again. The turmoil the Trojans are going through to start this season will only make them closer, and, as Williams insisted, that will make a tangible difference on the field.
“[W]hen you’re close to someone they’re like your brother,” Williams said. “You’re gonna fight for your brother that’s next to you.”
Without Shaw and Brown, the remaining Trojans once again only have each other.
I fully expect the leaders of this team to step up, calm the storm and bring an extra spark of passion to the game on Saturday.
Fight on and Beat the Bulldogs.

The recent drama surrounding the USC football team took a turn on Thursday morning, when USC’s senior cornerback-turned-running back Anthony Brown quit the football team and used social media to voice his reasoning for doing so, alleging that head coach Steve Sarkisian was a racist.
Gone, baby, gone · Senior running back Anthony Brown racked up 43 tackles during the three years he played cornerback for USC. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Brown posted a quote on his Instagram account Thursday morning that read, “COULDN’T PLAY FOR A RACIST MAN!!!!” with the caption “Sark treated me like a slave in his Office…Can’t play for a racist MAN!!!!! #Fighton” The post has since been removed from Brown’s Instagram.
A Facebook post with the same message was posted by Brown and was later removed as well.
Though the news only went public this Thursday, Brown officially quit last Thursday, Aug. 21, according to ESPN.
Sarkisian confirmed this Thursday that Anthony Brown had in fact decided to leave the team. Sarkisian responded to Brown’s comments on his social media accounts with livid shock and disagreement.
“As far as what [Brown] said … I think it’s ridiculous,” Sarkisian told ESPN Los Angeles. “Any of you guys that know me and if you ask anybody in our building, any of our players — feel free to — that’s about the furthest thing from the truth. Quite honestly, I’m shocked.”
Both former and current players of Sarkisian immediately rushed to his defense on social media platforms.
Redshirt sophomore linebacker Scott Felix tweeted, “Coach Sark is a great coach and [an] even better person. Accusations like that couldn’t be more untrue. #FightOn.”
Former Trojan quarterback Matt Leinart, who played at USC while Sarkisian was an assistant, echoed that same sentiment.
“I know Sark as well as anyone,” Leinart tweeted. “He is the farthest thing from a racist. This is a ridiculous claim!”
Just two days from the start of the 2014-15 season, the news of Brown’s departure from the squad seemingly has very little effect on the roster depth.
Brown, who prepped at Kaiser High School in Fontana, California, was listed as the sixth running back on the depth chart.
During his first few years as a cornerback, Brown accrued 43 tackles in six starts, but had been limited because of injuries to his ankle in 2013.
Sarkisian converted Brown to a running back during fall camp, per Anthony’s request, hoping that accommodating his wishes would both encourage him and provide him with more playing time.
But after hyperextending his elbow during training camp, Brown was discouraged and did not want to keep playing.
“It’s a bit unfortunate because we could have used him,” Sarkisian told ESPN Los Angeles. “We think he could have helped us.”
Sark reiterated that he believed in Brown as “an asset,” but his continued efforts to retain Brown on the squad were in vain.
“I thought he could get healthy … I didn’t want him to quit,” Sarkisian said. “I wanted him to come back and play and he chose not to.”
Brown fired back later that day, though, by providing his side of the story in an interview with Annenberg TV News.
“[He] called me a coward several times,” Brown said. “I never felt like that. Twenty-three years old, and I’ve never been talked to like that … He said a lot of things that put me in a situation where I was belittled, like trash, like I’m nobody.”
The Trojans will start the 2014 season against Fresno State this Saturday at 4:30 p.m. without Brown.

After seven long months, numerous position battles and some notable off-field incidents, the USC football team is right where it was at the end of the 2013 season — preparing to take on the Fresno State Bulldogs.
Ferocious · Junior defensive end Leonard Williams (94) barely saw any playing time in last year’s game against Fresno State. Williams, who only recorded one tackle, will surely be out for blood in his 2014 debut. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Though much has changed for the No. 15 Trojans since their 45-20 beatdown of Fresno State in last December’s Las Vegas Bowl, a strong core of key players remains. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler used last year’s bowl as a coming-out party, throwing for 345 yards and four touchdowns, both career bests. Redshirt junior tailback Javorius “Buck” Allen and junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor both bring explosive talent and a wealth of experience to the table.
On the other side of the ball, junior defensive end Leonard Williams is a preseason All-American, while senior linebacker Hayes Pullard turned down the NFL draft to return for his final season.
Where the Trojans lost the most talent — namely on the offensive line and in the secondary — they have added a number of talented freshmen. Toa Lobendahn and Damien Mama will start at the offensive guard spots, while Adoree’ Jackson and John “JuJu” Smith should see time in the defensive backfield.
Of course, the most important change USC made this offseason will be patrolling the sideline on Saturday afternoon. New head coach Steve Sarkisian, who has had to deal with the suspension of senior defensive back Josh Shaw and the departure of senior tailback Anthony Brown in his first game week, is confident that his team has remained focused.
“I think [the guys] are in a really great frame of mind,” Sarkisian said. “I credit that to the leadership on this team. We really try to keep things separated; when we’re focused on football its about football. We never get externally motivated, one way or the other.”
Sarkisian brings more than a new coaching staff to the Trojans. The former BYU quarterback has spent the spring and fall installing an up-tempo, hybrid spread offense. Allen is confident the team is ready for the debut of this new look.
“The biggest difference is just the tempo to be honest,” Allen told USC Athletics’ radio program, Trojans Live. “Last year in the bowl game we had a few plays where we lined up in the pistol so we could get used to it. Coach Sark and his staff come with a wonderful game plan, and I’m gonna try to execute it my best.”
Sarkisian’s counterpart, Fresno State head coach Tim DeRuyter, will bring a team to the Coliseum that looks much different from the one that fell apart against the Trojans in December.
The Bulldogs’ most obvious loss comes at the quarterback position, where the coaching staff has yet to name a replacement for ex-standout Derek Carr. Carr was a two-time Mountain West Conference Offensive Player of the Year who led the nation in both passing yards and touchdowns last season. His presumed replacement, Brian Burrell, struggled in spring camp and has never started a college game. Burrell’s competition, Duke transfer Brandon Connette, still lags far behind in his knowledge of the Bulldogs’ playbook. DeRuyter will make a game-time decision as to who will start, but both Burrell and Connette should see playing time.
Sarkisian is aware of the challenge that a two-quarterback system presents.
“They’re both good athletes, they’re both good runners and can throw it,” Sarkisian said. “I’m sure we’ll have a couple wrinkles for each guy.”
Not making the pair of signal-callers’ lives any easier are the losses Fresno State suffered at wide receiver. Davante Adams, who connected with Carr for 23 touchdowns last season, is gone, as is Carr’s second-favorite target, Isaiah Burse.
The 2014 Bulldogs’ best weapon at wideout is actually a fairly unknown player, at least to USC fans. Josh Harper was the third in a trio of 1,000-yard receivers for Fresno State last year, finishing the campaign with 1,011 yards and 13 touchdowns. Harper will be seeking redemption, however, after missing both the conference championship game and the Las Vegas Bowl with a groin injury.
The Fresno State passing attack will be greeted by a talented, if somewhat inexperienced, USC secondary. Sophomore Su’a Cravens will line up at strong safety for the second straight year. At cornerback, where the suspension of Shaw will be felt the hardest, Sarkisian will hope to see improvement out of senior Kevon Seymour and a number of young players.
“[Losing Shaw] makes us younger in the secondary, quite honestly,” Sarkisian said. “I think we’re still very talented back there, but we will have to rely on guys like Seymour, McQuay and Cravens as the Adoree’ Jacksons and the Chris Hawkins of the world get accustomed to playing.”
Despite the major loss of current Jacksonville Jaguar Marqise Lee, USC’s aerial performance should not look too different on Saturday from what fans saw last December. With weapons at receiver that include Agholor, redshirt junior George Farmer and suprising freshman Ajene Harris, not too mention the versatile Allen, Kessler is excited about the unit’s potential.
“The new offense is awesome,” Kessler said. “Coach Sark did a really good job of explaining it to me and breaking it down for me. I will be able to run a little bit more, and use my feet to make some plays.”
Though DeRuyter’s pass-heavy offense leaves little room for running backs to thrive, returning starter Marteze Waller has been effective in limited opportunities. The 5-foot-11, 210-pound bruiser averaged 5.2 yards per carry last season while scoring seven times. Unfortunately for Waller, one of his worst games last season came against an intimidating USC front seven that returns a number of key players.
Headlining the group is Williams, who struggled with injury in 2013 but still managed 74 total tackles, including 13.5 for loss, and six sacks. The Daytona Beach, Florida native is an a 6-foot-5, 300-pound athletic specimen, who many consider the top prospect in the 2015 NFL Draft. For now, however, Williams is focused on the season.
“I see the hype a lot but to be honest I really don’t pay attention to that,” Williams said. “I’m so ready … We’ve got new coaches, a new team, we’re just looking past all the old, bad stuff in the past, and we’re just ready to have a good season this year.”
Though all signs point to 2014 being a rebuilding year for Fresno State, it would be unwise for Sarkisian and USC to overlook the Bulldogs ahead of the Trojans’ week two showdown with No. 11 Stanford. DeRuyter is 17-4 in two seasons at Fresno, already with two Mountain West titles under his belt. The quarterback guru may lack a field general now, but Carr made impressive strides in only two seasons under DeRuyter.
Still, history favors the Trojans in Saturday’s contest. The team has won their past 16 season openers, and has won their past two matchups with the Bulldogs — including a memorable 42-41 2005 victory that has since been vacated by the NCAA. Trojan fans can also take heart in Sarkisian’s words after what he repeatedly called a solid week of practice, despite the distractions.
“We’re all chomping at the bit, ready to get out there.”
