USC alumna Tara Campbell, graduate of the class of 2015, is running for city council in her hometown of Yorba Linda, California.
Campbell graduated in Spring 2015 with a bachelors degree in political science and broadcast and digital journalism. As a student, she was involved with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Theta Xi chapter of Delta Delta Delta.
Campbell expressed the importance USC has played in her short, yet productive political career this far.
“The Trojan Family has been a key to my success. My professors and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute put me in touch with the Marian Bergeson Excellence in Public Service Series,” Campbell said. “The Trojan Family is what got me started.”
Following her graduation, Campbell has been pursuing a masters of public administration in the Price School of Public Policy, which she will receive this May. Aside from her graduate studies, Campbell has also been working full-time for State Assemblywoman for California’s 55th District Ling Ling Chang.
Campbell has already received endorsements from Chang, Assemblywoman Young Kim, former California Secretary of Education Marian Bergeson and Republican National Convention Committeewoman Linda Ackerman, among others.
To Campbell, the desire to utilize the education she has received to give back to her hometown is the driving reason behind her campaign for Yorba Linda City Council. According to her, the city is lacking in the face of an ever-digitalizing world.
“I was born and raised here, this is my home, I want to give back,” Campbell said. “Communication and tech is my key issue. [The City of Yorba Linda] needs to be more accessible and tech-savvy.”
As a graduate of both the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, she has learned the importance of technology and information in the world of governance.
“My background in broadcast and digital journalism along with my background in political science and public administration has given me a unique perspective for our city council,” Campbell said. “I know the importance and power of communication, and my background has provided me with the tools and capability to combine digital communication and civic engagement for Yorba Linda.”
For Campbell, community service and volunteering has been a passion for her since she was young, and she attributes this to the civic-minded spirit of Yorba Linda.
“[Yorba Linda is] a community that gives back,” Campbell said. “That is something that has been in my blood. Now I’m trying to give back at the civic level.”
Campbell noted initial concerns over her relatively young age, but mentioned the value that community members place on education, insight and hometown roots over age.
“I thought my age would play a factor, but I have met so much support,” Campbell said. “People who are really excited for our city. They are excited for a product of the city to represent the city.”

Jenny Ming, president and chief executive officer of Charlotte Russe and former president of Old Navy, spoke to undergraduate students on Thursday evening at Popovich Hall about the importance of team management and communication in executive leadership. The session was titled “View from the Top: A Conversation with Jenny Ming.” The talk was part of The Center for Management Communication Expert’s Speaker Series and was moderated by James Owens, professor of clinical management communication at USC.
The event was structured in a question and answer format, beginning with general overarching questions from Professor Owens. When asked about the role that communication plays in her management of Charlotte Russe, Ming repeatedly emphasized the importance and necessity of good communication in creating a successful business model and pleasant working environment.
“Communication is the most important aspect of business, and I am not just saying that,” Ming said. “Being a leader, you can think all you want, but if you can’t share your ideas, they don’t get done. Communication is key in being successful as a leader, but I want to not just be the leader of the team, I want to be part of the team.”
Additionally, Ming explained her methods of successfully executing a business model that would lead to ongoing company success.
“I always think of a business as a startup, turnaround, and growth. Even when Old Navy was a $3 billion company I still thought of it as a startup,” Ming said. “Turn-around is important to keep in mind because sometimes you need to switch around a business model. And growth because I’m always thinking about how we can leverage size and grow bigger.”
In 1994, Ming was part of the executive team that launched Gap Inc.’s Old Navy division, later becoming its president in 1999. After she left Old Navy in 2006, the company generated $6 billion in sales. Since 2009, Ming has been the president and CEO of Charlotte Russe, a clothing company specifically catering to young women. Ming also advises companies such as Levi Strauss & Co. and Barney’s New York.
Once the session was open to the rest of the room, the topics switched from a conversation on Ming’s own experience to her advice for recent college graduates entering the job market.
“A lot of jobs are opportunistic, not planned,” Ming said. “It is important to take a lot of risks in your life. When you are too comfortable, it is time to move on. I worked 20 years at Gap but in different positions. It is important to keep asking yourself, ‘Am I happy with where I am?’”
Bryanna Wallace, a freshman majoring in business administration, found the event to be worthwhile and educational.
“Jenny provided great insight into the business world and how communication has an influence on that,” Wallace said. “She also talked about how it is important to have an open mind and view your company as always evolving. It was also just great being in her presence because Charlotte Russe is my favorite store.”
Helene Burghoff, a freshman majoring in economics, said she appreciated Ming’s talk as a way to learn outside of the classroom to get in touch with the business world during the academic year.
“I think the talk was really interesting,” Burghoff said. “Marshall always has so many events like this one, and it’s good because you can learn about these things in class, but it’s much more beneficial to learn it through listening to these people.”

Sir Partha Dasgupta, the Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of economics at the University of Cambridge and the 2016 recipient of the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, gave a lecture on sustainable development in The Forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Thursday.
The Tyler Prize was established by John and Alice Tyler in 1972 and has been administered by USC for 43 years. The award seeks “to recognize those individuals who have contributed in an outstanding manner to the scientific knowledge and public leadership to preserve and enhance the environment of the world,” according to their website. Recipients are recognized at a ceremony in Los Angeles with a commemorative medallion and a $200,000 prize.
Dasgupta was born in Dhaka, British India (now Bangladesh) and has received degrees from the University of Dehli and the University of Cambridge. Throughout his tenure, he has taught at a number of prestigious research universities including Stanford University, Cornell University and the London School of Economics.
As a prominent economist, Sir Partha has published 23 books and more than 300 articles. His research has covered a broad range of topics and global problems, notably sustainable development and his effort to “[bridge] the gap between environment and the human condition.”
Dasgupta was a pioneer in forging the concept of “sustainable development” in the 1970s, years before the term was popularized in the environmental community. His research has focused on the interdisciplinary nature of environmental studies, suggesting the interconnectedness of poverty, population, resources and biodiversity. He has also advocated for intergenerational well-being, as opposed to traditional metrics such as GDP, to become the most significant ways to measure and observe sustainable development over time.
Though recognizing that the value of certain things cannot be quantified in any objective way, he stressed the importance of assigning economic value to assets, including natural resources and social capital, among others. By doing this, as opposed to thinking of nature as having intrinsic worth separate from economic value, environmentalists can provide more tangible incentives for individuals and institutions to act in more sustainable ways.
Julia Marton-Lefevre, the chair of the executive committee of the Tyler Prize, said that Sir Partha is the first economist to ever receive the Tyler Prize.
“We feel that the work that Partha Dasgupta has done has really made a contribution in the way we are trying to address the way we measure well-being,” Marton-Lefevre said. “And we felt that it was very important that, for him, well-being wasn’t only for people like us, in comfortable countries like this one, but also to think very seriously about the fate of the more than 2 billion very poor people on the planet.”
Autumn Mizuno, a freshman majoring in international relations, said Partha helped to change her perspective on sustainable development.
“I never really associated putting a value on nature as a way to instigate change with regards to environmental policy in the way we look at the world,” Mizuno said.
Marton-Lefevre also commented on urgency of this issue in light of global sustainability efforts.
“This is the year that sustainable development goals have been set by all our governments,” Marton-Lefevre said. “And the idea is that all of these goals are related to each other. That’s what his work has illustrated, and let’s hope it works.”

The women’s water polo team looks to put a cap on its undefeated regular season when they host Cal in their final home game Friday. USC is 20-0 this season including 5-0 in MPSF play. Cal is 19-7 and 1-3 in conference play.
During the season, USC has outscored their opponents 253-85. The team leads the MPSF in both offense and defense scoring an average of 12.65 goals per game while only allowing 4.25.
No. 6 Cal’s most recent game was a 13-5 loss at the hands of No. 3 Stanford last week. USC has already beaten Cal twice this season, once in a 12-6 victory in the UC Irvine Invitational and again 6-5 in Berkeley. The focus for the Women of Troy will be on stopping the Golden Bears’ top goal-scorer sophomore Carla Carrega who has scored 53 times this season.
There are two possible goaltenders for the Golden Bears. One is junior Madeline Trabucco and the other is freshman Madison Tagg who are both averaging 5.6 saves per game.
On the offensive, USC is led by junior driver Stephania Haralabidis who has scored 50 goals to date which puts her at No. 8 on the career goals scored list with 172. Two other Trojans have scored more than 30 goals this season — junior driver Ioanna Haralabidis and junior 2-meter Brigitta Games with 33 and 32 goals, respectively.
In the cage is freshman Amanda Longan who has appeared in 40 periods and is averaging 9.9 saves. She is joined by sophomore All-American goalie Victória Chamorro who is averaging 6.9 saves through her 32 periods of work.
Friday’s game will not only mark the end of the regular season, but also the end of a career for the three seniors on the team. Goalie Alegra Hueso, driver Melissa Bergesen and driver Nicola Welch will be honored before the game begins.
Looking ahead, regardless of Friday’s outcome, USC has already clinched the top-seed in the MPSF tournament which is set to begin for the Women of Troy on April 30.

Distance runners and field athletes are headed off to UC San Diego to compete in the Triton Invitational Friday and Saturday. The majority of participating USC athletes will be throwers and distance runners. Sprinters, hurdlers and most jumpers are getting a week off before the USC-UCLA Dual Meet May 1, at UCLA.
At UCSD, the Trojans will face off against collegiate athletes and professionals in the Triton Track and Field Stadium. Senior thrower, current Pac-12 Women’s Field Athlete of the Week, discus throw school record-holder and owner of the farthest discus throw in the NCAA this season, senior Tera Novy, is among the athletes preparing for this weekend’s competition.
Novy is coming off a second record-breaking throw this season. Novy broke her own school record when she threw 196-6 on April 2 and bested that when she threw 200-5 at the CSULA Twilight Meet on April 14. At the meet she also had throws of 196-1 and 200-1.
“Coach Dan [Lange] said to work on some technique to make my throw better in the finish. It’s about working on the little things, refining it, making it better,” Novy said. “[My results] show that all the hard work is paying off; just gotta stay focused on the process and not let the numbers get ahead of me.”
Despite her continued success, Novy is looking forward to the weekend.
“Just having fun and being able to go out there and compete with some good girls,” Novy said. “It’s mainly a professional meet, and there’ll be girls from all around the country, including the best in America. So, it’ll be nice to have some good competition.”
Novy will be one of seven Trojan throwers at UCSD this weekend. Freshman Nathan Bultman will join redshirt sophomore Nick Ponzio for the men’s shot put and discus throw events. Freshman Matthew Katnik will also compete in the shot put event, while redshirt sophomore David Sellens will perform in the hammer throw next to Bultman. Redshirt junior Erika Peyton and junior Tanya Sapa will participate in the women’s hammer throw. Sapa will also throw in the shot put.
There will also be distance runners on hand for the No. 3-ranked Women of Troy. Senior Natasha Strickland, Redshirt sophomore Rebekah Ent and freshmen Rachel Glynn, Taylor Seamans and Amber Gore will be racing in the 800-meter race.
For the 3,000-meter run will be redshirt freshmen Madison Ricks and Sophia Racette. Racette will also run at the 5,000-meter distance. Competing in the 3,000-meter steeplechase will be seniors Jenna Tong and Katerina Berdousi.
Sophomore Madisen Richards will compete in the long jump.
For the No. 15 Men of Troy, the 800-meter race will feature senior Will Robinson and sophomores Jordon Wallin and Mitchell Cameron. Cameron will also be competing in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. In the 5,000-meter run will be freshmen Nicolaus Jakowec and Trent Rule.

On Wednesday, ESPN fired baseball analyst Curt Schilling after he shared a meme on Facebook supporting a controversial North Carolina law that forces transgender people to use the bathrooms corresponding to their birth genders. On Thursday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver publicly stated he would take the 2017 All-Star Game away from Charlotte if the same law wasn’t changed.
There are people who say sports don’t matter because they are, on the surface, silly games played with balls and sticks and baskets. Those who don’t follow sports have no clue who Curt Schilling is, much less care about what he has to say.
But the truth is that sports are bigger than just games — they consist of multi-billion dollar leagues and millionaire athletes and coaches. And like any other multi-billion industry, these leagues have a sizeable footprint in society, and their star players have a voice much larger than that of the average Joe.
It’s why ESPN fired Schilling and why North Carolina should take Silver’s threat very seriously. For better or for worse, this is the impact that sports can have on society.
Schilling, an all-time great pitcher-turned-analyst, was just daring ESPN to fire him. Last year, the network suspended him for a month after sharing a Twitter post that compared Muslims to Nazis. In March, he went on a radio show and said that Hillary Clinton “should be buried under a jail somewhere.”
While Schilling crossed the line numerous times, ESPN is firing him on the grounds of his opinions — which he is certainly entitled to — rather than him not fulfilling his actual duty as a baseball analyst. An average Joe working as a truck driver would probably not be fired for doing what Schilling did, but as a public figure and television personality, it was too big of an embarrassment for ESPN.
To be clear: The North Carolina law is awful and a clear attempt to discriminate against transgender people. But Schilling has a right to engage in the debate without losing his job.
Additionally, I think such a law should be changed for a different reason than the NBA threatening to pull the All-Star Game. The NBA is absolutely doing the right thing by taking a stance on a controversial issue. But in turn, if North Carolina changes the law, it will be because its politicians don’t want to lose out on the millions of dollars that holding an All-Star Game would bring into the state, not because they genuinely believe the law is wrong.
It’s happened before. Just last month, Georgia governor Nathan Deal vetoed an anti-gay rights bill after the NFL warned that the passing of the law could cost Atlanta a Super Bowl in the future. Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a similar bill two years ago based on a similar threat — the NFL threatening to pull the Super Bowl in 2015 from Phoenix. Last year, while the Final Four was being held in Indianapolis, Indiana immediately issued amendments to another religious liberty bill after NCAA President Mark Emmert spoke out against it. In the 1990s, the NFL also almost single-handedly forced Arizona to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day by actually rescinding a Super Bowl from the state. Not until the voters approved the holiday did the league bring the game back to Arizona in 1996.
Losing out on All-Star Games, Super Bowls or Final Fours should not be the main catalysts for social change. Sure, the results should be applauded, but the reasons behind them are based more on money than morality — and I’m afraid what’s happening in North Carolina is heading toward the same path.
Ultimately, all of this shows that the power of sports stretches well off the playing field and into politics, and that creates ambiguity. Schilling has shown no indication that he is anything but a bigoted moron, but should his political opinions be held against him by his now ex-employer? The North Carolina law should be repealed, but does it sit right that it might only happen because a basketball game won’t be played there?
I guess we’ll have to take what we can get. Obviously, it would be ideal if governors stopped signing discriminatory laws and former athletes refrained from supporting them, but until that day comes, we are — at least partially — reliant on sports figures such as ESPN and NBA commissioners to police society, for better or for worse.

A highly public figure (athlete, politician, actor, etc.) who misbehaves or makes obnoxious statements to the media reflects badly on his employer – a TV network, a sports team, a political party, a movie being made  – and that person knows the penalties. They are clearly spelled out in their contract – fine, suspension, or dismissal.  
Simple rule: Think whatever you like, but don’t damage yourself by blurting it out. Insult, disparage, threaten or upset people and there are social and maybe financial and career penalties to be paid. For a public figure who has signed a contract spelling this out, the stupidity of doing it is even worse.

Former tight end Bryce Dixon has been sentenced to six years in state prison Thursday following a January crime spree.
The 19-year-old pleaded no contest to three charges — carjacking and two counts of second-degree robbery, according to the L.A. County District Attorney’s Office. He also admitted to using a knife during a robbery.
“After extensive discussions with the district attorney’s office and working with them, I believe we arrived at a deal that will allow him to put this behind him and move on with his life while still being a young man,” Dixon’s attorney Joshua Ritter said to the L.A. Times.
The “spate of robberies,” as described by the D.A.’s office, eventually led to his arrest near the USC campus on Jan. 19.
Former LSU lineman Trey Lealaimatafao pleaded not guilty to similar charges in the case.
Dixon faced more than 18 years in prison on nine counts including assault with a deadly weapon.
In addition to the alleged carjacking and robberies that occurred Jan. 19, the pair is also suspected of being tied to a series of crimes that occurred the day before in Camarillo, Oxnard, Ventura and, eventually, Los Angeles.
Dixon played at USC during the 2014 football season, but was kicked off the team and eventually expelled in May 2015 after an investigation into two sexual assault cases. He was reinstated as a student after challenging the expulsion in court, but was not allowed to return to the football team.
Lealaimatafao had been expelled by LSU after three separate off-field incidents last June and he is scheduled to appear in court again on May 5.

USC Thornton Opera presented its final opera of the 2015-16 season with Richard Strauss’ Ariadne auf Naxos on Wednesday. In the first of three shows, the performance was held at Bing Theatre.
Ariadne auf Naxos is one of Strauss’ most beloved operas. Furthermore, its popularity makes it exceedingly difficult to judge without mentally referring to previous stagings. USC Thornton Opera is known for producing operas that are atypical to standard repertoire; however, Ariadne auf Naxos has been on USC Thornton Opera’s to-do list for some time now. In an interview with USC News, Ken Cazan, who is resident stage director and chair of the Vocal Arts and Opera department at Thornton School of Music, expressed his ardor for directing this particular opera.
“It’s a piece I’ve always wanted to do, and we finally have the voices to do it,” Cazan said.
The opera is set in two parts. The first, the Prologue, details the farce between two musical troupes who are scheduled to perform at the home of wealthy Viennese patron. The second half depicts the actual performance, in which both musical groups are forced to merge their respective performances into one. Cazan, who is known for his sharp stage direction, chose to update the piece to reflect German cabaret culture during the latter half of the Weimar Republic.
Considering the difficulty of Strauss’ music, staging this opera with students at a university level was definitely ambitious. However, Brent McMunn, who serves as resident music director of USC Thornton Opera, is no stranger to Strauss; having conducted Ariadne auf Naxos on several occasions, McMunn thrived during Wednesday’s performance. Through McMunn’s direction, the orchestra maintained its opulent sound throughout the evening.
Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the singing — the performances from the singers did not equate to the richness achieved from the orchestra or stage directions. However, the singers are not entirely at fault; Ariadne auf Naxos requires not only voices that are able to cut through the size of a Straussian orchestra, but also demands immaculate vocal technique in order to avoid pandemonium. Though all singers displayed definite potential, it was perhaps unwise to produce an opera as taxing and strenuous as this. Though USC Thornton Opera has waited many years for the right voices before staging this masterpiece, perhaps another year would have been more appropriate.
The finest singing of the evening, however, came from graduate certificate candidate in Vocal Arts Yelena Dyachek as Der Komponist. Dyachek, a recent winner of the 2016 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, seemed to be in a league of her own. Her colossal voice was complemented by the skilfull, sensitive nature she brought to her character.
Other standouts include Alyssa Wills in the title role. Wills, who is also a Graduate Certificate candidate in Vocal Arts, began the performance a bit precariously; however, she blossomed as the evening continued, delivering a truly stunning “Es gibt ein Reich” during the second part.
Also worth mentioning is first year master’s student Anastasia Malliaras, who proved to be the audience favorite with her cunning interpretation of Zerbinetta. Baritone Matthew Hough, a senior majoring in vocal arts, showed the most potential in his performance as Ein Musiklehrer; with time, his voice will boom into a solid, dramatic instrument.
Ariadne auf Naxos  will again run on Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are free for USC students, faculty and staff. More information regarding USC Thornton Opera’s production of Ariadne auf Naxos can be found online.

No need to worry about being late, the sequel to Alice in Wonderland the hit 2010 live action spectacle, debuts May 27 in theaters worldwide. Alice Through The Looking Glass, reunites the beloved characters from the original film: the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, the Blue Caterpillar, and, of course, Alice, as well as many more quirky characters. Taking the directing reigns from the visual revolutionary Tim Burton this time around is James Bobin, who is known for the film The Muppets as well as acclaimed television shows such as Enlightened and Flight of the Conchords.
The Daily Trojan had the opportunity to speak with Bobin about a wide range of subjects, from working with well-known actors Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter to enhancing the visual style of Tim Burton.
“I think really when you’re making a film which is a sequel you have to stay true to the original design in the sense that it feels like the universe and it’s the same world,” Bobin said. “But what was good about this film is that it was — the new movie is set both before and after that film. And also geographically it’s a different location and different places we visit which we haven’t been to before.”
Alice Through The Looking Glass takes place both before and after the plot of the first movie, as Alice (Mia Wasikowska), is forced to go back in time to defeat the Lord of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), as he attempts to turn Wonderland into a barren, lifeless world. In typical movie fashion, Alice cannot do this alone and seeks the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) as well as the Red and White Queen (Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway, respectively). Along the way, Alice will encounter new places and new characters that will have an impact on her and how she views the world of Wonderland.
With such an emphasis on the visual world of Wonderland in the first film, Bobin, as well as the writers and studio, believed it was necessary to continue that theme through the creation of these new places for Alice and the team to visit. Bobin, after reading the script, cited the challenges of creating new, innovative places and his process in doing so.
“So often I would do sketches, because I like drawing.” Bobin said.  “Time … has a castle, he lives in this incredible place. And I had an idea about this distance and some sort of obstacle to get to where he was.”
Undoubtedly when one thinks of the film Alice in Wonderland the Mad Hatter himself instantly comes to mind. Returning to one of his many famous character impressions, Depp reprises his role in this film.
“[As the Mad Hatter], he knows his character very well. And so he very much was aware of this character and how this character is played, how he works and his strengths et cetera,” Bobin said. “And when he created the character with [Burton], I think he independently came up with the same idea. It’s always what I thought it should be.”
Alice Through The Looking Glass also features the final performance of film icon Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar. Bobin cites Rickman as one of his heroes and was passionate about the process of working with him, saying simply, “It was amazing.”
While the original film redefined the visual world that films could create via special effects and expert production design in 2010, there is no doubt that the sequel will do the same. Reuniting an all-star cast and beloved characters that transcend age, race and place, Alice Through The Looking Glass is bound to be filled with incredible visuals and production design, a lot of laughs and heart, and definitely, totally worth your time. So don’t be late on May 27, for it is a very important date.

It’s that time of year where the world seems to cry every time you hear someone say, “It’s finals! May your grades be at least passing!” But just beyond the doom and gloom of take-home essays and exams on things you swear you never learned is the sweet, sweet smell of summer. Festivals, camping trips, cross-country drives or just sitting around with friends wasting time; summer is the promise of whatever you want it to be.
For some, summer isn’t a time to relax — there ain’t no rest for the wicked after all. Internships, long shifts in unfortunate uniforms or running around getting coffee for the person at the company that could make or break your future, the summer is just as grueling as the school year, the only bright side is you don’t have to buy textbooks. It’s not a time for dream pop or underground bangers, it’s the time for nose-to-the-grind music. Workday pop playlists are abounding on Spotify. It’s the perfect genre to meld together in an upbeat tempo that will keep you awake but not distracted the whole shift through.
Maybe you’re a creative. Your summer plans involve crashing photo shoots, finding open spots on sets and using whatever time you have left to make some new music with that guy you bonded with in the comments section of some unknown music blog. An eclectic summer of music awaits in the wing. Everything from trip hop to dream pop and synth-inspired rock. Truth is, you can’t be told what music to listen to, it just somehow finds you.
For the rest of us, who will have a mix of the two, this playlist is a fun-fueled soundtrack of softness that can easily translate to any activity.
Some weekends will be spent on a road trip, visits to swimming holes out in the mountains, pub crawls or whatever shenanigans float your boat. The week will be a 9 to 5 in your chosen field or a couple of shifts to afford the gas your high school car requires. You need some upbeat indie – upbeat enough to keep you going but dreamy enough to make your summer that much more memorable.

The pressure is on. On Sunday, high school seniors across the nation will be deciding where they’ll be spending the next four years of their lives. They’ve toured campuses, pored over brochures and, most likely, frequented college rankings websites. While college rankings, such as those provided by U.S. News and World Report, are based on multiple categories, from retention rates to admissions selectivity, one factor is missing: campus safety and, in particular, sexual assault rates.
Last week, dozens from the House of Representatives have urged U.S. News to add this category and include university prevention and response. After years of criticism over nebulous criterion such as “academic reputation,” it makes sense for U.S. News to include data on sexual violence, an aspect of college life that incoming students deserve to be well informed on beforehand.
After all, college rankings are supposed to provide all relevant information about life at a certain university. U.S. News states that its rankings are “based on our researched view of what matters in education.” For national universities, U.S. News rankings depend on undergraduate academic reputation, retention, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate performance and the alumni giving rate.
These rankings, however, ignore the predatory culture so deeply entrenched in campus life. Even the recent release of the College Scorecard — a ratings system endorsed by the Obama Administration, aimed at providing more and better data and fostering greater transparency within university ratings — does not include data on sexual assault on campuses. And this Scorecard has caught the attention of President C. L. Max Nikias himself, who traveled to Washington, D.C. last year to point out what he viewed as shortcomings in the ratings system, saying it didn’t value things like academic excellence highly enough.
As things stand today, one in five women are sexually assaulted in college, according to a 2015 survey by the Association of American Universities. A campus climate survey released in September 2015 showed that 29.7 percent of female undergraduate students at USC have experienced some form of sexual assault or misconduct since attending the school. These appalling statistics should be enough to instigate change. They point to the gravity of an issue that scars and wounds so many, affecting students’ ability to thrive in their academic, personal and professional lives. Simply branding sexual assault as a health issue is a sore misstep — it is as much an academic one, and metrics of academic value should therefore include it. In excluding sexual assault as a criterion, rankings fail as an indicator of a truly valuable college experience.
Incorporating sexual assault statistics is also a matter of evaluating the incentives that universities care about. Even as the issue of campus sexual assault has reached national audiences, some students feel that they were unprepared for a culture that fails to adequately discourage sexual violence from taking place on campus. As the system currently stands, universities are disincentivized to provide potential students about sexual assault statistics. Outside regulatory bodies that have the power to influence university behavior — like college rankings — should step in and fill this gap.
Including data in the rankings will not only point to the gravity of the issue, but also force administrators to do more than pay lip service to the issue of sexual violence on campuses nationwide. University initiatives about campus sexual assault give researchers a measurable benchmark to identify which schools foster rape culture and which are making efforts to combat it — a factor that high school seniors should take into account.
Today, several campuses are making strides to address this issue. USC recently implemented a sexual assault awareness course; San Diego State University implemented a rape crisis advocate to respond to sexual assault.
But more often than not, little is done — if at all — and prospective students should know which colleges are culpable.
The Harvard Crimson ran an ad last Saturday that stood as a haunting reminder that many colleges still don’t side with survivors. The ad featured a mock acceptance letter that read, “The claims you will make against your rapist will be ignored, much like your right to feel safe at school.”
Then, below it, it warns, “If they accept you, don’t accept this.” It’s a short but powerful statement. Rankings have the power to affect the change needed and should aim to do so — because, if sexual assault remains at the bottom of universities’ priorities, the price of admission isn’t worth paying.

On the surface, it sounds like a good idea. In practice, it will have the opposite effect. This would push universities to under-report the problem.

It is with a bittersweet sadness and burgeoning nostalgia that I acknowledge not only the end of the school year, but also the final episode of “Playing Politics.” I had scarcely arrived back in sunny Los Angeles in the early days of the semester when I began penning its first installment. So it is with great pride, and perhaps a little shock, that I observe its end.
I am clearly a partisan columnist, and this was clearly a partisan column. It was written with the pride and the persistence of a Southern Democrat, and not for a second was I unaware of that fact. But I have tried to take care and preserve a common — and bipartisan — theme: Civic engagement is the only thing standing between democracy and plutocracy, equity and oligarchy, policy and demagoguery. No matter whether you rallied for Black Lives Matter or think Kim Davis should be venerated, whether you love Bill Maher or Bill O’Reilly — if you support the value of stable Western democracy, then do your duty to preserve it. Get educated, stay informed, think critically and get to the polls.
If you’re skeptical that Bernie Sanders could really offer every American kid a free ticket to college, you should be equally skeptical that Donald Trump could really Ziploc this country’s entire southern border. If you think Ted Cruz isn’t entirely deserving of his smarmy reputation, maybe you should also rethink Hillary Clinton’s Ice Queen status — and vice versa. There’s pandering, peddling and pointing fingers on both sides of the aisle. No matter which party your values most closely align with, be certain you are educated, informed and analyzing what you’re reading. If you really can’t say how the Electoral College works or don’t really know how representatives to the Senate and House are apportioned, there are droves of videos, articles and quick explanations for all sorts of governing bodies and programs. Know the basics on issues — there’s a 60-second explanatory YouTube video for everything from Benghazi to Obamacare to the Panama Papers.
But getting educated is useless if you don’t stay informed. It is incredibly important that you get your news from more than one reliable source, and not from the television. Start with The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal; read CNN Politics or Newsweek. The key to informed voting is — unsurprisingly — information.
The second thing you can do is get active. Our campus boasts not only party-affiliated political clubs like the USC College Democrats and USC College Republicans, but also organizations like the Political Student Assembly that are decidedly bipartisan and efficacy-focused. If you’re passionate about a certain issue, join its organization, like Students for Justice in Palestine, or look into a club like College Students for Bernie that supports your favorite candidate. Share your voice — write into national college publications like PolicyMic or USA TODAY College, or start within campus and apply to write for the Daily Trojan.
Most importantly, you need to vote. I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, but those who want to excuse themselves from their civic duty have lots of convenient explanations as to how voting is useless or your voice won’t really count — but it’s widespread misconceptions like these that make the college-age vote so unreliable. If you’re wondering why the Democratic National Committee decided early on that Sanders wasn’t going to make it against Clinton, it’s partially because his support is based on a demographic that doesn’t care to actually go vote. The bitter truth is that every time you decline to cast your ballot, your opponent’s vote counts twice. So if you really care so little that you could get to the polls but won’t, that’s your choice — but don’t pretend it’s because your actions wouldn’t have counted.
Finally, every single voting citizen in this country needs to make their best effort to think critically. Understand why a talking head on Fox News or even a presidential candidate like Clinton might be telling you what they’re telling you. Even if you dearly love your party, know its policy from its propaganda. Don’t base a presidential vote on sound bites you hear or impressions you get — look at platforms, free and available on every candidate’s website. Ask yourself if this person’s values really align with yours, whether they’re capable of  — or intending on — fulfilling campaign promises, what their connections are to existing establishments, who they’ve worked with and why they’re running.
This year, and this column might be coming to an end, but this election is not. The California Primary is on June 7, and the general election is not soon after. Get excited — you are at a university that affords you great opportunities to get informed and get involved. There’s a world to be changed — but it begins with your voice.

As I think about what I’m going to miss most about USC, I realized that, weirdly enough, one of the things I’ll miss the most is something that also caused me the most stress. Writing the penultimate story that I’ll ever write for the Daily Trojan, I feel like I owe the DT a thank you. 
Even though my work for the Daily Trojan has kept me up late at night, caused unrelenting pressure at times and kept me glued to my phone for the latest news updates, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. 
It’s true that the life of a student journalist isn’t exactly the norm. My non-DT friends thought I was crazy for spending countless hours in the newsroom and for devoting so much time and effort on something that had no impact on my grades with an already full course schedule. 
Understandably so, it’s a choice that can seem strange to other students. There was the time when I was on a bus on my way to a fraternity event while frantically texting my staff trying to find someone to cover a court case back in L.A. while someone shotgunned a beer just across the aisle. There were the instances when I skipped class to cover a story, or when, after telling my one of my friends about all the work I had done as blog editor last semester, I remember her asking, to my dismay:   
“Do you think anyone ever even reads the website?” 
But no matter how many page views we get, my dedication to the Daily Trojan remains because of a group of students who care deeply about writing, investigating and sharing the stories around our campus that deserve to be told. Finding a group of students who are as passionate about something as all the Daily Trojan editors are, is something I’ll always be grateful for.  
Taking on leadership roles at the Daily Trojan has put me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible. It’s taught me how to manage a group of people, to work with fellow editors even when we don’t agree and to be a part of something where people are relying on you to do your job day in and day out. 
Most importantly, this paper has given me some of my best friends. All the hard work, whether it’s for a semester or all four years, creates a bond amongst the editors and writers that is unmatched. There are other organizations I’ve been involved in where people come and go, but at the DT that’s just not the case. Once you’re an editor at the DT — even if it’s just one semester — you’re kind of stuck with us, sorry. So while being on staff is about putting out a newspaper every day, it’s also about the people who make all of that possible. 
It’s the end of semester celebrations, the weekends spent on retreats, the moments sitting on our balcony watching campus life move along four stories below, the Friendsgiving dinners and so much more. 
So as I get ready to say goodbye to USC, some might remember me as that weirdo journalism girl stressing out on a frat party bus, but that’s something I think I can live with.

And good riddance too! Don’t let the door hit you on the way out. 
Geeez! So liberal, no balance in perspective, and unintelligent. Do you think that writing with a liberal slant makes you sound intellectual, or hip? Laaaame.
