The new Study in the States program announced Friday aims to enrich the academic talent in the United States by attracting the brightest and most competitive international students through simplification of the visa application process.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration Custom Enforcement said the new online initiative as a part of the government’s increased effort to encourage international students to continue their studies in the United States. The initiative will simplify the visa process for international students interested in applying to higher education in the United States.
As part of the initiative, DHS and ICE have created a website for students applying to and attending colleges in the United States.
Tony Tambascia, executive director for the Office of International Services, said the website will be a useful tool because it was created by the government agencies that oversee the visa process.
“We’re reviewing this new website now to determine if we think it would be a resource we want to point students to,” Tambascia said. “There are many ways that students learn about how to go about becoming an international student at an American university, but the fact that this new site was developed by the Department of Homeland Security makes it interesting since DHS oversees all the rules and regulations for international students and scholars in the U.S.”
The interactive website offers foreign students the ability to track their own “road map to success” as they follow readily accessible information about applying for a student visa.
Anders Ho, a junior from Hong Kong majoring in international relations, said the website has the potential to offer useful tips that are not common knowledge for international students studying in the United States.
“International students are not necessarily [aware] of the procedures at American universities,” Ho said. “For example we have to apply for classes later than everybody else so it would be good if current international students can relay these types of helpful hints to new applicants on the site.”
Qi Shen, a graduate student from China studying in electrical engineering, said the visa application process is complicated.
“It’s great that the site is being launched because figuring out the steps for getting your student visa was one of the toughest parts in applying to different universities here,” Shen said.
The site also includes links to different social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, which allow students to share important information about visa requirements in a more accessible setting.
More than 1.1 million active nonimmigrant students and exchange visitors and their dependents attend colleges and universities, training programs and exchange programs in the United States, according to DHS.
Study in the States has also improved policies that give international students the opportunity to pursue a career in the United States after graduation. This year, DHS has also launched an extension to the STEM Designated Degree Program, which allows nonimmigrant graduates to stay in the United States up to 29 months after graduation as a part of Optional Practical Training.

Low blood sugar makes it more difficult for the body to resist high-calorie food, according to a USC-Yale study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation on Monday.
Fast food · A new study from USC and Yale University shows it is more difficult for people to resist food that is high in calories when their blood sugar is lower. - Robin Laird | Daily Trojan
The research was conducted by Kathleen Page, assistant professor of clinical medicine in the Keck School of Medicine division of endocrinology, while she was at Yale University.
“Sugar is the main fuel source for the brain, so when sugar levels are low that makes us hungrier,” Page said. “In this study we wanted to determine what kinds of foods the brain is hungry for when sugar levels are low.”
Page’s team used a special type of MRI to measure brain activity when test subjects were shown high-calorie foods, like cookies and pizza, and low-calorie foods, like fruits and vegetables.
“The region that normally activates in resistance to high-calorie foods — the pre-frontal cortex at the front of the brain — was much less activated when the subjects were hungry,” Page said. “Our findings suggest that when sugar levels are low, the body is less able to resist high-calorie foods.”
Students said their eating habits often mirror the study’s findings. D.J. Banton, a freshman majoring in screenwriting, said her busy schedule prevents her from eating meals on a regular basis.
“I often have to skip meals because of school,” Banton said. “My mind says you deserve something decadent because you haven’t eaten all day.”
Other students said they make time to eat well. Hikaru Komiyama, a freshman majoring in psychology, said she pursues a healthy lifestyle despite the confines of her meal plan.
“Sometimes I’ll go to EVK and just grab fruit for breakfast,” Komiyama said. “At lunch and dinner my roommate and I always get salads. It’s easy to make healthy choices, if you want to.”
USC Hospitality said it will continue efforts to make healthy foods readily available.
Executive Chef Eric Ernest told the Daily Trojan he planned to sell an original line of healthy grab-and-go foods throughout campus, so students in a rush can grab a quick, nutritious snack, last November.
Seeds Marketplace now sells natural and raw juices, berry and yogurt parfaits, fresh made sushi, options and protein-stacked sandwiches as part of the effort, Ernest said.
“We have a full line of natural snacks available at most retail units and many at Seeds Marketplace, which we’ve received positive comments about as they are mobile,” Ernest said in an email.
Students are taking advantage of these additions, according to Ernest.
“Healthy snack options continue to perform well in all units, especially residential dining,” Ernest said. “We have had a great response.”
Some students said they are more likely to buy unhealthy snacks because they are cheaper than healthier options. Nick Farmer, a freshman majoring in interactive media and theater, said he finds it hard to rationalize buying expensive health food.
“I find that there are opportunities to find health foods on campus at a low price, but the most desirable choices, like at Seeds, are more expensive,” Farmer said. “It seems like paying $6 for lettuce doesn’t justify itself like it would for buying a sandwich.”
Ernest said most healthy options on campus are not expensive, but some cost more for practical reasons.
“Natural snacks, fresh fruits and vegetables require production labor and real products from local and organic farms,” he said in an email. “Processed foods void of vitamins, nutrients and proteins have a long shelf life and cost less.”
Jake Hermle, a sophomore majoring in civil engineering, said students skip meals because of poor time management.
“You don’t skip meals because you’re sitting in front of the refrigerator and decide not to eat,” Hermle said. “You skip meals because you’re rushing to class and you actually don’t have time.”
Ernest said USC has worked and will continue to work to ensure its students eat consistently and nutritiously.
“We provide support and education for all of our guests,” he said. “I believe this effort can only work if it is a partnership and we offer variety.”
Page said her findings have a practical application.
“The take-home lesson is that if you eat on a regular schedule, you’ll be able to resist that cookie or that slice of pizza,” Page said.

Students involved in the USC lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community reacted with excitement to President Barack Obama signing the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy into law Tuesday.
The policy, signed into action by President Bill Clinton in 1993, prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.
Congress initiated the repeal last December when it voted to rescind DADT and was followed by the signing of a certification in late July issuing a 60-day waiting period, which ended today.
Obama said the repeal will not diminish military readiness.
The end of DADT was met with much celebration from the Queer and Allied Student Alliance, which has actively campaigned in favor of the repeal for months.
Vincent Vigil, the director of USC’s LGBT Resource Center, reacted to the news of the repeal with excitement.
“It shows that the country is changing,” Vigil said. “The repeal shows that the country’s and the constituents’ mindset is changing to be more accepting of gays and lesbians.”
Vigil said debate within states regarding same-sex marriage will continue to hinder progress within the LGBT community but, despite these foreseen setbacks, “individuals today feel okay to come out.”
Many students’ reactions have been equally supportive of the repeal.
“Sexual orientation shouldn’t be a major issue in the army,” said Rachel Ragusa, a sophomore majoring in biology. “This is a good step in equalizing. I feel like it’s OK to be whoever you are.”
Trevor Taylor, a freshman majoring in interactive media, said a person’s sexual orientation should not play an inhibiting role in the military.
“If you are laying your life down,” Taylor said. “You shouldn’t care about the guy’s sexuality. It’s just whether or not the guy has your back.”
Jeff Burgett, a sophomore majoring in production, said, although in theory the repeal of DADT is positive, there will continue to be problems of discrimination based on sexual orientation in the military.
“The reason [DADT] was administered was to protect people,” Burgett said. “There is always going to be persecution. But in an ideal world there should be no limitations.”
ROTC students may now come out.
Still can’t join my Frat, openly….
Arthur.
Please go back to your room at your mother’s house and think about what you just said. Come back out when you can be an adult.
How do we know the normalization of homosexuality in the military will decrease military readiness?
Barack Obama ensures us it will not decrease military readiness.
Since the country is in full decline, a military with decreased readiness is a good thing.  
I don’t want a highly effective military enforcing tyranny.
How quickly standards drop…we went from fighting Nazis and communists to celebrating sodomy in just a couple generations!

USC Latino Forum hosted a celebration Tuesday noting the donation of the personal and professional papers of Rubén Salazar, a prominent Mexican-American journalist.
Posterity · Journalism Professor Felix Gutierrez and journalist Rubén Salazar’s daughter Lisa Salazar Johnson speak at the event. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The documents, which were donated by Salazar’s children, will be permanently housed in Doheny Memorial Library for research purposes.
The collection includes Salazar’s professional work at the Los Angeles Times, where he covered the war in Vietnam, the massacre of student protesters in Mexico before the 1968 Olympics and the late 1960s Chicano Movement.
Félix Gutiérrez, a professor of journalism, who facilitated the donation from Salazar’s children, said research on Salazar will give undergraduate and graduate students hands-on experience with the late journalist’s letters, documents, notes and article drafts.
Gutiérrez said Salazar is the most honored Latino journalist in American history.
“He helped others understand a complex commnunity that was a relatively small part of Los Angeles when he was writing in the 1960s,” Gutiérrez said.
Salazar was an integral figure in the Latino movement in Los Angeles because he delivered the Chicano message through his articles, Gutiérrez said.
“[Salazar] was not an advocate, but he took our message and understanding us and who were to a wider audience at a time when there were very few Latinos working in the media,” Gutiérrez said.
Students will be also able to intern for filmmaker Philip Rodriguez, who is producing a documentary for public television on the life and mysterious death of Salazar.
Salazar was killed at the Silver Dollar Café in 1970 when a sheriff deputy, who believed a gunman was in the building, fired a tear gas canister. Salazar was hit in the head and died afterward.
Students said they appreciate the research and production opportunities provided by the collection of Salazar’s work.
“I have read about Salazar’s work in the past, and I am excited at the opportunity given to USC students to research on one of the best journalists  [the] 20th century witnessed,” said Stephanie Choi, a junior majoring in political science.
Shravya Chavva, a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts and film and television production, said she would be interested in having the opportunity to research and intern for the film on Salazar’s professional and personal life, as the opportunity normally is offered only to doctorate students.
The collection also marks a significant step in the expansion of the university’s research on the Latino community in Los Angeles, said Sonia Rodriguez, an advisor for USC Latino Forum and senior administrator for the department of American studies and ethnicity.
“This event signifies how USC is trusted to hold these important historic documents,” Rodriguez said. “In the past, Latino scholarly archives were mostly given to UCLA libraries. The fact that Salazar’s children chose USC to gift his professional archives for research is a huge step up not only for the USC Latino community, but the overall USC global research initiative.”
Gutiérrez said in addition to Salazar’s professional writings, the collection offers a glimpse into his personal life.
“It’s a priceless archive,” Gutiérrez said. “He’s very well-known in terms of his public work — outside of Hollywood actors he was one of the best known Latinos in Los Angeles in the 1960s. His family had 10 boxes of his stuff. They talk about his private side including school transcripts, awards he won and drafts of articles and interview notes.”
The collection  will be housed in the Special Collections Room on the second floor of Doheny indefinitely.

A number is worth a thousand words.
Not any old, run-of-the-mill digit, mind you: It has to be a telling number, an insightful statistic that gets to the heart of the matter.
As evidenced in the new movie Moneyball, statistics are an integral part of the modern sports landscape and, when properly studied and applied, can improve a team’s chances of winning on the field.
Though not to the same extent as baseball, football is also a numbers game.
The sample size is still very small, but three games into the 2011 season some numbers tell a very interesting story about USC football.
 
69,322
USC’s average attendance in its first three home games of the season is the lowest it has been since 57,744 fans showed up per week to the Coliseum in 2001.
Back then, Pete Carroll was in his first season as the Trojans’ head coach and quarterback Carson Palmer was a year away from winning USC’s fifth Heisman Trophy.
Granted, Minnesota, Utah and Syracuse aren’t exactly marquee opponents.
Traditional rivals Arizona, Stanford, Washington and UCLA are still left on the home schedule and the final average attendance number is expected to climb into the low to mid 70,000s.
Attendance, however, has fallen in each of the last four seasons, from a record high of 91,480 in 2006 to 79,907 last year.
Despite no NFL team in Los Angeles, the Lakers looking like they will be locked out for some time and the Dodgers out of playoff contention since June, USC still hasn’t been able to fill the Coliseum during one of the most barren sporting times in recent memory for the majority of Angelenos.
 
33
Robert Woods has garnered national attention for his early-season exploits, and for good reason: his 33 receptions lead the nation and are the most ever for a USC receiver over three games.
It’s what Woods has been doing away from the ball, however, that has really drawn praise from coach Lane Kiffin.
Following his 17-catch, 177-yard, three-touchdown game in the opener against Minnesota, Woods has faced a constant stream of double teams against Utah and Syracuse.
“Robert’s still playing really well even though his numbers aren’t the same as they were in the opener,” Kiffin said following Saturday’s win over Syracuse. “That’s where you see [tight end] Randall Telfer run wide open down the middle of the field because Robert’s out there and there goes the safety over the top to Robert and that leaves Randall open.”
 
16 points per game
Following a subpar 2010 campaign in which the Trojans gave up 26.7 points per game, their highest mark since 2000, USC coaches knew the defense needed to tighten up considerably.
Defensive mastermind Monte Kiffin tweaked his Tampa-2 scheme in the offseason to allow his players to read and react quicker to opposing offenses, rather than having to take the time to think through complex scenarios while the ball is in play.
The results so far have been substantial, with USC giving up 16 points per game, more than 10 points per game fewer than last season.
The revamped defense will face its toughest test yet Saturday night in the Arizona desert. Arizona State comes into the game averaging 457 yards of offense per contest, ranked 25th in the country.
 
Three forced turnovers
Though the Trojan defense has vastly improved, USC still isn’t forcing turnovers like it used to.
From 2001 to 2005 (Carroll’s first five years as USC’s coach), the Trojan defense averaged 38 turnovers per season, including a phenomenal 43 during the 2003 national championship season.
Over the last five seasons (2006-2010), however, USC has forced only 25.4 turnovers per year.
The 2011 Trojans have caused only three turnovers through three games: Torin Harris’ game-saving interception against Minnesota, T.J. McDonald’s first-quarter fumble recovery against Utah and backup linebacker Will Andrew’s fumble recovery in the fourth quarter against Syracuse.
Only 17 Football Bowl Subdivision teams have forced fewer turnovers this season.
 
One in Colley Matrix
USC fans, like those of any other school, have done their fair share of complaining in the past about BCS computer rankings.
With the Trojans ineligible for the postseason again this year, USC isn’t included in the weekly BCS rankings that combine six computer ranking systems with the Coaches’ Poll and the Harris Interactive Poll.
That doesn’t stop the computers from ranking the Trojans, however, and USC is the No. 1 team in the country this week, according to the Colley Matrix. Jeff Sagarin’s respected computer rankings have USC at No. 2 behind Alabama.
So, despite close-call victories over Minnesota and Utah, and a No. 23 ranking in the Associated Press poll, two systems reliant solely on numbers have pronounced USC the best college football team in the nation.
No one said statistics don’t have their limit.

For most Americans, their exposure to archery is limited to the four-year summer Olympic cycles. But on Sept. 10, a team USA and former USC archer dramatically captured a gold medal during the fourth stage of the Archery World Cup in Shanghai, making Joe Fanchin one of the rising stars in the world of archery.

Fanchin defeated Malaysian archer Khairul Anuar Mohamad to win the recurve men individual gold medal in a sudden-death shoot off.
“He was good, but I could shoot better than him,” Fanchin said. “You can make a couple mistakes, [but] the match isn’t over until it’s all the way over. I still knew that I would shoot well and that I was [going to] win.”
Fanchin’s journey, however, began years before his latest performance.
Fanchin began practicing archery before he turned 10 years old, as his uncle, Ed Fanchin, was a bow hunter who owned acres of land in the Corona, Calif., area. The young Fanchin learned the sport by shooting a toy bow on his uncle’s property.
Fanchin, however, didn’t see archery as anything more than a hobby — at least initially. He primarily shot in recreational competitions in high school. Not until he began looking at colleges did he consider the idea of pursuing archery competitively.
“When I was looking at colleges, I did want to join one that had an archery club,” Fanchin said. “I knew once I got [here] USC had one, and I joined up right way. It was really small back then when we shot out at a field archery range in Pasadena.”
After Fanchin joined USC in 2006, he surprised himself.  In 2007, the West Regional Collegiate Championships were held at Arizona State. Fanchin was, admittedly, surprised at the results. He won.
“No one at our school had ever won something that big,” he said. “I shot pretty good, but I didn’t expect to win at all. It was kind of an eye opener as far as being able to be good at archery and go far with it.”
After the tournament, he attended the national championships in Illinois, where he finished fifth overall and earned All-American honors. Following that solid performance, Fanchin began perfecting his archery more during summers. Because he was unable to practice at a traditional archery range, as there were none near his home in Oceanside, Calif., Fanchin set up a target in his garage to build strength and perfect his technique.
Throughout his final year at USC, Fanchin competed in different competitions to raise his national ranking to be accepted into the year-round U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif., just outside of San Diego.
Last month, Fanchin participated in the third stage of the Archery World Cup in Ogden, Utah. Fanchin collected two gold medals and a bronze as a part of Team USA. But Fanchin’s true individual test came in Shanghai.
Fanchin went up 2-0 early, but Mohamad fought back to tie it at two apiece. Fanchin then shot strong and moved his advantage to 4-2, but once again, Mohamad shot better and tied the match at 5-5.
“I was a little bummed out it didn’t work out quite as well early on, but I was still pretty confident at that point that I would win,” Fanchin said of the late stages in the match.
He shot a 10 on his next shot. For Mohamad to win, he would have needed to hit another 10. Mohamad pulled back and fired. His score was a nine.
Later this month, Fanchin will be part of the team trying to take home the gold hardware at the World Cup final in Istanbul and he feels like his team’s chances are good.
“My teammate Brady [Ellison] won the World Cup Final last year, which was a pretty big step for him and our country,” Fanchin said. “So he will be there as the number one ranked archer; he won the first three World Cups this year. I’m ranked second,  and I’m happy with that seed. I think it will work out well.”
Though Fanchin is looking ahead 11 months to archery’s biggest stage, the Olympics, he doesn’t want to stray away from his current goals: performing well at the World Cup Final and Olympic qualifying, which begins a week after the Istanbul tournament.
As the No. 6 archer in the world according to Federation Internationale de Tir l’Arc, anything less than winning gold in London next summer will be a disappointment for Fanchin.
“The Olympics is really big,” Fanchin said. “I would like to win the Olympics, but right now my focus is on putting together the best archery game I can for every tournament.”

Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott announced Tuesday that the conference will not expand beyond 12 members following speculation it would add Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas and Texas Tech.
The league’s presidents and chancellors held a vote Tuesday night reaffirming their decision remain a 12-team league
“We have determined that it is in the best interests of our member institutions, student-athletes and fans to remain a 12-team conference,” Scott said in a statement. “While we have great respect for all of the institutions that have contacted us, and certain expansion proposals were financially attractive, we have a strong conference structure and culture of equality that we are committed to preserve. With new landmark TV agreements and plans to launch our innovative television networks, we are going to focus solely on these great assets, our strong heritage and the bright future in front of us.”
The league announced a 12-year television contract with Fox and ESPN worth approximately $3 billion in May.
After having ruined the Pac-10 by recruiting the great champions of Utah and Colorado, the Harvard tennis player and girl’s tennis promoter, now that the harm is done, doesn’t want to expand to a include some actually significant foes.  We can no longer play a round-robin conference schedule, with an undisputed champion, we have to play Utah and Colorado, both in the sousthern Pac-12 division and geographicaly north of Palo Alto and Berkely, and give up rivalries that go back nearly 100 years.  Why?
Fight On!

USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Tuesday that senior defensive tackle Armond Armstead will redshirt the 2011 season. Armstead has been absent from practices because of an undisclosed medical condition and was hospitalized in March when he underwent a series of tests.

“After meeting with everybody involved, the best thing is to redshirt him right now being this late in the season,” Kiffin said. “He’s going to probably graduate, finish his degree this semester and we’ll have him back next year.”
Last season Armstead started 11 games for the Trojans, finishing with 43 tackles and three sacks, but he has not practiced since being hospitalized. Though redshirting, Armstead could still leave for the NFL draft should he opt to declare.

After a strong game on both sides of the ball in a win against Syracuse, No. 23 USC heads to the desert in its first Pac-12 road game against Arizona State.
“We want to make sure we do a great job with our composure and not get in a personal foul type of game regardless of what the opponent is doing,” Kiffin said. “When emotions go up, we can’t let our decision-making go down.”
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley noted he enjoys playing road games because of the energy.
“I almost like away games more,” Barkley said.  “Just being in that environment, everyone is yelling at you. You almost have to focus more.”
USC is approaching its first road match-up as if it were just another game.
“We just got to take it week by week and approach it like every other game,” said redshirt freshman tight end Xavier Grimble. “Every game is a serious game. You can be beat on any given night.”
Barkley is no stranger to hostile environments on the road, as he led the Trojans to a victory over Ohio State in Columbus his freshman year. He offered advice to the younger players on how to deal with the pre-game jitters and uneasiness of playing in an unfamiliar environment.
“Be yourself,” Barkley said. “Don’t worry about those — it’s still our game plan and it’s still our offense.”
—
Senior tailback Marc Tyler feels Barkley exudes more confidence this year behind center.
“It feels like he [Barkley] has a better timing and rhythm with the receivers,” Tyler said. “I know him and Robert [Woods] work together a lot. Matt looks confident out there.”
Though Barkley’s 8:1 touchdown-to-inerception ratio through three games indicates he has made progress since last year, he is pleased with the play of the other receivers who have stepped up.
“It’s great because we have other athletes on our team that can make plays as well,” he said. “If they want to overcompensate for covering [Woods], it is just going to open up other guys and that’s what you saw on Saturday.”
—
Though Syracuse was missing its defensive end — and arguably top defensive presence — in Chandler Jones on Saturday, the USC defense will have to prepare for Arizona State linebacker Vontaze Burfict, who has made a name for himself as one of the top linebackers in the country. Burfict has accumulated 17 tackles and four sacks for the Sun Devils this season.
“As young as we are, I think we are a mature group so that [Burfict] shouldn’t take us out of our game at all,” junior center Khaled Holmes said. “Their whole defense plays with a lot of tenacity.”
Barkley echoed similar sentiments, saying although the team has to worry about Burfict, the entire Sun Devils’ defense should be the team’s focus.
“Vontaze is the highlight of that defense,” Barkley said. “They play it really well and they play fast so it will be a good challenge for us.”
—
The Trojans remain relatively healthy after three weeks. Kiffin announced freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson, senior offensive tackle Martin Coleman, redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater and junior wide receiver Brice Butler were out for Tuesday’s practice. Junior guard Abe Markowitz was limited in practice.
“We anticipate all of those guys playing and we hope to have them back later in the week,” Kiffin said.

Every year, a few bands go from the talk of their local hometowns to finding themselves in the national spotlight.
While some bands only stay on listeners’ radars momentarily, others leave a lasting impression and maintain their standings as worthwhile up-and-comers.

Farewell Fighter, I the Mighty and Young the Giant serve as the perfect testament to new bands to keep an eye out for; they have used their fan-fueled momentum to become forces to be reckoned with.
Farewell Fighter
A four-piece pop-punk band from Nashville, Farewell Fighter is earning acclaim left and right as it connects with fans from all over the country. After being crowned Alternative Press’ Hometown Heroes of 2010, the unsigned band is determined to keep improving.
Farewell Fighter initially gained recognition through a forceful online presence. Last year, one of its first releases on iTunes was the song “Forever Alone (Follow Me),” referencing a popular phrase frequently used on Tumblr, the site the band used to connect with many people.
Since then, it has knocked out two EPs — including The Way We Learn, released earlier this year — and has begun a national tour.
Farewell Fighter is considered a DIY band. Booking its own shows, designing its own merchandise and performing fun and relatable songs all illustrate the band’s solid work ethic. Band members even share their endeavors by keeping in touch with loyal fans through Facebook and an email newsletter.
This month, the band prepares for an East Coast tour during October and November.
I the Mighty
The guys in I the Mighty, a band from San Francisco, have found themselves in a new stage of their careers. The band went from playing shows in tiny venues scattered around the Bay Area to touring in Southern California at places like Chain Reaction. It recently signed with Equal Vision Records in June.
As a progressive alternative rock band, I the Mighty can be compared to the likes of Envy on the Coast, Circa Survive and Bayside. Joining the Equal Vision family of bands seems like a perfect fit. The group has a dynamic force behind its music, keeping listeners on their toes, especially with the tracks “Just Drive” and “Modern Medicine.” The band never fails to engage energetic audience participation at its shows, whether through singing or dancing along.
I the Mighty has made a point to get to know its fans by casually hanging out during shows, chatting with them on Facebook and involving them with the filming of a music video for its latest single. In return, veteran fans can hold onto the fact that the band members are normal guys, even with their rising fame.
This fall, I the Mighty will release its EP Karma Never Sleeps.
Young the Giant
 
Starting out as a small Orange County indie band, Young the Giant, formally called The Jakes, is gradually becoming world-renowned.
After a few alterations to the band’s dynamic and recording its EP Shake My Hand, the band began gaining some recognition in 2009 at the South by Southwest music festival in Texas. Around the same time, the group signed to Roadrunner Records and gained some airwaves on the Los Angeles KROQ radio station. It’s been uphill for the five guys ever since.
The catchy songs “Apartment,” “My Body” and “Cough Syrup,” from the band’s self-titled album, received positive feedback when live performance videos traveled around the web via YouTube.
Young the Giant spent its time this summer sharing its distinct sound at festivals such as Lollapalooza and touring overseas. The band even scored some television exposure when it performed at this year’s VMAs.
Young the Giant will be releasing a remix EP on Sept. 12. The band has also just embarked on a tour with Incubus, which will make a stop at the Hollywood Bowl on Oct. 7.

The Godfather of Soul’s spirit continues to live on today. James Brown’s success as a gospel, pop and soul artist is impossible to overlook.
Show business · The James Brown exhibition at Los Angeles’ prestigious GRAMMY Museum offers attendees a tantalizing and aesthetically pleasing look at Brown’s political life and musical career. - Photo courtesy of WireImage.com and Amy Graves
The GRAMMY Museum at L.A. Live opened its new exhibition, “Say It Loud: The Genius of James Brown,” on Sept. 17. Celebrating the life and career of Brown, the displays illustrate how Brown has greatly influenced music and pop culture since his heyday.
Brown’s music has visitors tapping their feet or busting a move or two on a small color-changing dance floor, similar to the one in Saturday Night Fever.
Vibrant hues of orange, teal, purple and red make the room very lively, especially with pixilated images of Brown in entertaining poses on the walls.
The life-sized images of him with his 1950s three-inch pompadour are decorated everywhere, making viewers feel as if Brown is in the room with them.
The museum makes use of Brown’s multiple nicknames — Mr. Dynamite, the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, and of course, Sex Machine — and prints them up high on the room’s colorful walls.
“Say It Loud” describes Brown as a musical renaissance man through his ventures songwriting, leading a band and being a  soulful singer.
For music history buffs, there is excellent historical information for each portion of the exhibition.
Displays discuss how Brown taught himself to play multiple instruments, ultimately leading him to be known for his vocal improvisations and dynamic music. He infused his music with gospel music and the secular sound of the blues.
The exhibition focuses on Brown’s contribution to the evolution of hip-hop. A video interview titled “How James Brown Influenced Hip-Hop” shows rappers Too-Short, Run-DMC and Chuck D discussing Brown’s influence. Run-DMC describes him as “powerful.” Chuck D recounts a childhood of listening to Brown every time his parents turned on his music.
Another video features some of Brown’s good friends, including Mike Hartt, who provided several of the showcased items. Bootsy Collins, Brown’s bass player and a member of Parliament-Funkadelic, is also shown in footage of a previous special event at the GRAMMY Museum. He believes Brown is “still the man.”
The exhibition’s non-chronological set up makes being there a unique experience. It shows Brown as a man with an iconic voice and shares trends he set in the worlds of dance and fashion.
Shown by various photos and videos, the highlight of his performances was the passion he put into his stage antics.
A screen in front of the exhibition’s dance floor shows a video of Brown demonstrating popular old-school dances — such as the Boogaloo, Funky Chicken, Camel Walk, Robot and Soul Train — that he used to perform.
Videos of Brown doing these dances and his signature move incorporating the Mashed Potato with sudden slides and splits are amusing to watch. He is described as a “rubber-limbed dancer.”
Judging by the selection of stage outfits showcased in all their glory, it is clear Brown made sure to stand out in a crowd. A purple and black jumpsuit, purple cape and charismatic black suits on display show his funky side. His fringed western clothes and cowboy boots put a twist on his already eccentric collection of threads.
The exhibition does a fantastic job revealing the type of man Brown was, even briefly touching upon Brown’s involvement with the fight for civil rights.
His song “Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m proud),” which inspired the name of the exhibit, was an anthem encouraging black pride among black Americans.
Though the exhibit could probably be expanded to include more relics, visitors can still spend a good amount of time looking at the entire collection.
The fun, personal items, such as handwritten lyrics on aged Holiday Inn stationery, old albums, photos, ticket stubs and posters come together nicely to give an inside look into Brown’s legendary life.
“Say It Loud: The Genius of James Brown” will be open until Jan. 22.

Microsoft is always trying to stay on top, and it’s doing one heck of a job.
Last week, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer previewed a new television feature for Xbox 360 at an event called BUILD in Anaheim, Calif.
The company is now inching its way into the realm of cable and satellite television through the Xbox 360.
In June, Microsoft confirmed its plans to incorporate a live-television feature into its Xbox LIVE service later this year. According to rumors and vague press releases, the feature will require owners to have subscription services to compatible cable or satellite providers and will also include on-demand access for instant programming needs.
Though the ability to watch live television via Xbox LIVE is innovative and cost-efficient, the console already offers multiple access points for instant entertainment through its streaming services for Netflix, Hulu Plus and ESPN.
With this addition of live programming, the Xbox 360 tests our notions of exactly how to define video game consoles in this decade.
Besides altering the Xbox to become more of a “do-it-all” piece of technology, how will Microsoft truly improve the average viewer’s television experience?
The answer is simple: By capitalizing on futuristic, voice-activated technology.
The live-television accessory has garnered considerable interest with its addition of a voice-control feature, which will theoretically use viewers’ oral commands to search for and select television programs via its Kinect accessory.
The feature utilizes Microsoft’s Bing search engine and is intended to simplify the tedious process of mashing buttons on your remote control. It will search across Netflix, Hulu and live TV, making it an extraordinarily convenient and sophisticated option.
Voice features, such as those on cell phones, aren’t necessarily the most impressive technological advancements we’ve made in the past decade or so. But Microsoft is working hard to make this feature a success and, judging from its future endeavors, there’s a good chance that will happen.
In addition to the live-television streaming, by the end of this year, Microsoft will be releasing a mega update to its Xbox 360 dashboard.
The dashboard, or the user interface for the Xbox 360, is named Twist Control and will include a Bing search engine that employs the Kinect with improved voice functionality. Other upcoming features include the option of “cloud storage,” the ability to save to an online database rather than an individual memory card, as well as better Facebook connectivity.
The overhaul of Microsoft’s dashboard fits nicely with the company’s plans to introduce live-television streaming. Each of these business moves is a way for Microsoft to capitalize on and market the Xbox 360’s universal functionality. This isn’t a surprising step for the company, especially when about 40 percent of the console’s activity is non-gaming-related.
After all, in today’s world, video game consoles are hardly used only for video games. Microsoft’s recent decisions prove the standard notion of a “game console” is slowly but surely shifting into this idea of an “entertainment platform.” People don’t just want video games or television anymore — they want it all. And they want it as cheap and convenient as they can get it.
Interestingly, when it comes to this constant renovating, the Xbox 360 still lacks a fairly basic feature: Blu-ray support.
Despite the fact Sony’s PlayStation 3 has had it for some time now, the move on Microsoft’s part is clearly purposeful and doesn’t mean the company is stingy or falling behind. Microsoft has stated that it doesn’t acknowledge any pressing need to include Blu-ray compatibility as long as the Xbox 360 has fully functional, digital-streaming capability.
Even if Microsoft has a few kinks to work out with its upcoming dashboard and live-television service, there’s no doubt these additions will lure a variety of customers. The Xbox 360 is still primarily a video game console, but even that term is beginning to sound outdated when you really look at what the technology has to offer.

What would’ve helped is to include that the Xbox 360 can already be used for the AT&T Uverse TV.  It requires an adaptor but it is a current function.  The software that the Uverse boxes use is by Microsoft as well.
I can stream blu-ray from my pc through my 360, but know one ever mentions this.

The television world has never been in such a precarious situation. At a time when pilots are picked up and jettisoned in a matter of seconds, it seems that if a new show hopes to survive, it had better be created by Chuck Lorre.
For the past few years, cable TV has trumped major network programming — sometimes in viewership, almost always in quality. This year, however, the “Big Five” (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox and the CW) seem to be striking back. Shows about Playboy clubs in Chicago, being a flight attendant in the ’60s, and copious others about werewolves/vampires/witches are looking to put the “major” back into major networks.
Among these shows, there is one that could go the distance. CBS’ New Girl stars perennial geek goddess Zooey Deschanel as recently dumped Jessica “Jess” Day. Broken-hearted and left without an apartment, she moves in with three guys: Nick (Jake M. Johnson), Schmidt (Max Greenfield) and Coach (Damon Wayans Jr.).
What happens when a geeky girl who sings to herself hangs out with three good-looking, babe-obsessed dudes? This show should have “hackneyed” written all over it.
New Girl, however, is fresh, exciting, quite hilarious and pleasantly surprising. There are a few problems with structure, but that’s normal for a pilot still trying to find its niche. In terms of editing, some scenes are far too choppy, with transitions less than fluid. Nonetheless, such flaws are barely noticeable when placed beside the superior character development.
All of the characters initially seem cliché: the nerd (complete with large frame glasses), the lovesick bartender, the babe magnet and the body-obsessed athlete. The difference is these caricatures are grounded in a sort of heartbreaking humanity.
When Jess cries while watching Dirty Dancing, the audience doesn’t roll their eyes; instead we laugh and start to realize that we’ve all been there, trapped in the pits of complete despair.
Deschanel is clearly the heart of the series. She brings the iridescent charm that made her a star in (500) Days of Summer, embodying the personality of everyone’s best friend — and a drop dead gorgeous one at that.
Deschanel manages to personify the very essence of a metamorphosis, transforming Jess from a pitiable mess to a girl we all can root for.
New Girl has the ability to put a smile on even the most pessimistic person’s face. After all, hating someone as sweet and cute as Deschanel seems like a sin — almost like hating happiness altogether.
Though the other characters border on caricature, the chemistry between the actors keeps the show planted firmly on earth.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One-liners that might otherwise sound cliché get zing through the reactions they elicit from other characters, with dialogue easily flowing from one to another — courtesy of Elizabeth Meriwether, the writer of No Strings Attached (2011).
When Schmidt says something that might have come from the mouth of any frat guy at ‘SC, the boys make him put a dollar in the “Douchebag Jar.” There’s humor, heart and a touch of reality.
All of the actors are dedicated to the humanization of their roles. They attempt to inject depth into a single-cam sitcom. It’s unfortunate that Wayans Jr. will no longer be featured in the show because of prior commitments, but hopefully Lamorne Morris will be able to match his chemistry with the group.
Sometimes though, ace acting cannot help plot details. The characters are basically best friends by the conclusion of the pilot, complete with a sing-along in a nice restaurant, but such close relationships couldn’t possibly happen in the short timeline into which they have been placed. Also, conflict meets resolution too quickly — it leaves the audience wondering what more to look forward to.
New Girl is quite different from our own: a world where nerdy girls with supermodel best friends can be friends with hot boys. The best part is the show manages to convince us all that this world exists. If only life were this much fun.
New Girl premiered last night on Fox, and will air a new episode next Tuesday.

Many students who applied for study abroad programs are currently finding out where they will be going next semester. Some students, however, are limited in destinations because of overly stringent class requirements.
Hey You | Daily Trojan
The idea of studying abroad is terribly enticing to me. Studying at USC and taking advantage of a cultural center such as Los Angeles is obviously fantastic.
But being able to have all that and the ability to venture out and study in another country, absorbing a new culture and adding a whole new dimension to your education, is a concept oozing appeal.
There is one major flaw. The university offers countless study abroad options but these are not all created equal.
Certain majors, such as engineering, have rigid requirements. Among the numerous study abroad options, engineering majors are only able to study in a few of them.
All of these options exist in places where the primary language is English. Frankly, these options are a bit underwhelming. That is not to say that these places are not beautiful, or exotic, or lack a new and exciting place of study, but as all destinations are former members of the British Empire, they do share several similarities.
Though Australia is a wonderful destination, it shares similarities to the one we live in. Students could instead be immersed in an entirely foreign culture by going somewhere like Egypt, India or Kenya.
The world is a diverse place, and studying abroad is a unique opportunity to explore just how different things are around the world.
With that in mind, the idea of going to a place where the most obvious difference from Los Angeles is what side of the road people drive on seems inadequate.
If an engineering major chooses to study abroad in a place not included on the list of suggested engineering destinations, there is a good chance they will not graduate in four years. At a school encouraging us to be modern renaissance men and women and global scholars, we are limited by a list of class requirements that the university believes we cannot satisfy anywhere else.
USC is so focused on itself that it ultimately discourages us to branch out.
The most frustrating aspect of it all is that a school like the American University in Cairo offers engineering courses, so conceivably students would not have to abandon their major studies entirely and could still explore the world.
Because of the narrow selection of courses approved for credit, however, the options for an engineering student, like myself or other students with intensely focused workloads, are decimated.
The university should allow students to study abroad at a destination of their choice. Though not all professors or courses are created equal, there are plenty of universities across the globe where students can fulfill upper-division courses.
Instead, we are left weighing difficult decisions, and unsure of the outcome.
Study abroad is an idea that excites many; however, because of the scarcity of options some majors offer to many students, it will only remain an idea.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts-critical studies. His column “Thoughts From the Quad” runs Wednesdays. 
How about the fact that the USC College only offers ONE study abroad program in Spanish speaking South America (Santiago). One program on an entire continent. Kind of ridiculous, no?
Two of your three examples of “better” countries to go, India and Kenya, were once part of the British Empire and are still members of the Commonwealth, the exact places you said you wanted to avoid in the previous sentence, so I guess you have to rule out those too…
So where *do* you want to go?
Egypt under British rule from 1882 to 1952. All three example countries were part of the Empire for a good number of overlapping years.

Monterrey, Mexico. Aug 25. 3:45 p.m. Six gunmen enter Casino Royale, set the building on fire and leave 52 civilians dead.
Later that day, Mexican president Felipe Calderon and the federal government’s spokesman for security affairs, Alejandro Poire, condemn the attack and label it an act of terror.
Kate Mock | Daily Trojan
This has been the most violent crime committed since Calderon took office and declared war on the drug cartels in 2006. His message was brave, energetic and idealist; it was a call to unity, a call for society and government to come together and destroy the minority of murderers and crooks who are holding the country in checkmate.
Maybe, after all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
The thesis is quite simple: Mexican society and government cannot win the war while consumers in the United States continue to finance the drug cartels.
California’s Proposition 19, which attempted to legalize marijuana in the state, sent a message to Mexicans that American society and politicians couldn’t care less about Mexico’s problematic drug cartels.
Prop 19 was a clear demonstration of American insensitivity considering California’s extensive Mexican population and heritage.
The amount of student support for Prop 19 also made it clear many students do not understand the crippling effect the legalization of marijuana would have had on Mexico.
Likewise, it was a perplexing move, considering California was among the first states in the nation to act against Arizona’s racist immigration policies by imposing economic sanctions by boycotting local Arizona products. One action seems to cancel the other out.
In short, Americans seem to be having a hard time linking drug consumption to death and political instability across the southern border.
Mexico’s organized crime is losing power. Drug cartels are seeing their trade routes shut down by increasingly tight border security.
The burning of a casino and the massacre of civilians are acts of desperation; when business is running smoothly, there is no need for violence. The Mexican government has had success cracking down on the cartels and their drug trade, but it has not been able to protect Mexican citizens from becoming collateral damage in the hands of these criminals.
Furthermore, the government has not implemented a solid strategy to combat what fuels the cartels — consumer dollars. Organized crime originates through the forces of supply and demand. U.S. drug consumption shows no signs of decline, but if there is a will, there is a way.
Both the Bush and Obama administrations have pledged billions of dollars in aid but have failed at reducing consumption.
Though the federal level has taken action in an attempt to end the war, state governments are simultaneously attempting to legalize. The United States needs to unilaterally decide which course of action to take.
Calderon’s recognition of the burning of the casino as a terrorist act could allow both the U.S. and Mexican authorities to find common ground.
Mexico’s war on drug trafficking is similar to America’s war on terror: a war with no end in sight, but must be fought because of the ideals at stake. This is the perfect opportunity for good neighbors, like Mexico and California, to come together and practice what they preach.
If history has taught us anything it is that we can’t rely on state or federal governments to be consistent.
We need to look to universities for this consistency, and it is the youth in these institutions who can make an actual difference.
We are USC students, and many of us wrote something in our application essay about changing the world and helping those in need. This is a time when we can actually use that starry-eyed optimism and turn it into something meaningful.
USC does not have to be a “party school” or the “University of Spoiled Children.” We are California residents, whether for four years or a lifetime.
This means our home has strong and historic economic, cultural, political and social ties to Mexico. Reflect on this the next time a joint is rolled at a party you’re at.
Take a moment to think what might be behind those crushed green leaves: all the death, all the corruption, all because of one little joint.
Do not lazily blame prohibition or government policies. Though they are incongrous, complaining about them will not get the country very far.
Instead think of what you can do. Are you being congruent? We allow the laws of supply and demand to operate. We are a key player in ending the drug war.
On the other hand, why help out your southern neighbor? It is so much cooler these days to help Africa. Keep this in mind: If your neighbor’s house catches fire, your house will eventually burn down too.
 
Rafael Fernandez De Castro Samano is a sophomore majoring in communication. 
“Do not lazily blame prohibition or government policies.”  Sounds like you are the one being lazy here.  All the evidence points to the fact that prohibitionist policies are what is driving the Mexican cartels.  If there is no prohibition, there’s no organized crime (at least in the drug market)–you only need to look at the booze runners and Al Capone to show you that.  After alcohol prohibition was repealed, the demand for black-market alcohol disappeared, thus making the crime unprofitable, thus eliminating the crime.
Rather than blaming Prop 19, why don’t you argue that more states should be pursuing legalization policies?  Why not argue that every drug should be legal?  And for god’s sake, why are you just blaming marijuana?  Yes, it makes up 60% of the cartels’ profits, but it would be the easiest to legalize (for some reason, heroin legalization is still unpopular) and the most effective way to starve cartels of their profits.
Let’s bring agricultural jobs back to California and help our southern neighbor by legalizing marijuana.  Another legalization referendum will be on the 2012 ballot, and I hope that it will have your support, Rafael.  It will be a hell of a lot more helpful for Mexico than arguing for continued prohibition.

Philippe the Original is a landmark Los Angeles restaurants every USC student should try at least once. Claiming to be the birth place of the original “French Dipped Sandwich,” Philippe’s serves a delicious variety of dishes besides its famous French Dipped Sandwich, including a home-made mustard.
Philippe’s is not a typical restaurant, largely due to its unique service. Upon entering, customers are shuffled into 10 different lines in front of a long display counter with 10 servers known as “Carvers.” Each Carver will take your order, make your sandwich, ladle your soup, fill your drinks and collect your money.
The restaurant has an old-fashioned feel, with long wooden tables and booths. There are ceiling fans, neon soft drink and beer signs, and even sawdust on the floor for authenticity. On the walls is a plethora of posters, press clippings and pictures collected since 1908 — when Philippe’s opened. The design of the restaurant has not changed much since then and it continues to uphold the idea that “you can make yourself at home” in this restaurant.
The French dipped sandwich is the top choice for customers; they can choose between roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey or ham. The meat is served on a fresh, lightly textured French roll dipped in “natural gravy of the roasts.”
There are side dishes to accompany your sandwich, including cole slaw, homemade potato and macaroni salads, pickles, black olives and hot yellow chili peppers. For dessert, there is a selection of scrumptious, freshly baked pies to choose from.
I give Philippe’s an eight out of 10 for its authenticity, unique atmosphere and delicious French dipped sandwiches.

Would you use an app that lets you know who else in your building likes the music that you do? The idea sounds a little creepy. Imagine walking up to a complete stranger and saying “I noticed you like Band of Horses too!”
Yet, sonar.me is a new app that lets music fans do just that. The application taps into users Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn accounts to generate an all-encompassing social networking experience. The various accounts create a database of all the users “likes” and then compares them to every other person in the same vicinity who is plugged into sonar.me.
After the app has located people around you who share similar interests, a feature prompts you to introduce yourself to the other party through a type of instant message.
Brett Martin, Sonar’s founder, released a statement about the product, saying “With one click, we give you a rank-ordered list of everyone at that venue and how you’re related to them. With your second click, we give you an overview of the person — who they are, how you’re connected to them, and what bands you both like. And with the third click, you can send a message to that person over public channels like Facebook or Twitter.”
The app seems a little off-kilter, and it’s hard to imagine fans can really get into something that seems so awkward. However, the bands and promotion companies might benefit from sonar.me more than the average person.
Band members, artists or publicity personnel will be able to tap into the Sonar network to see who’s at the show. After the show artists can talk directly to the fans and relate to their audience on a more personal level.
In an interview with Evolver.fm, Martin offered that “we can also tell you who liked the band before the show and who liked them afterwards, so you can say ‘Hey, we saw you at the show — did you have a good time?”
In essence, the app seems like a tool better fit for a promotional team than your everyday music fan. But, who knows. Social media is still developing, and sonar.me may be on to something exciting here.
Thanks for the write up Jamie.  I think that it’s all how you use the information.  Just a few years ago it would have been strange to have your photo albums, a list of your friends, or your resume public on the internet.
I’d love your thoughts on how to make sonar less awkward or more useful for music fans,
Thanks,
Brett from Sonar

With USC playing countless close games in the past three seasons, turnover margin has become an important statistic to monitor. On the one hand, each turnover created presents USC’s offense with a shorter field to work with. On the other hand, turning the ball stalls drives and hands momentum to the opponent. In the previous four seasons, the Trojans managed to either have a neutral or positive turnover margin.
USC Turnover Margin
2007: +2
2008: +7
2009: 0
2010: +4
2011: -2
USC is currently tied with UCLA for the ninth worst turnover margin in the conference, and ranks 89th nationally. In the first two games of 2011, turnovers prevented the Trojans from sealing victories well before the final minutes.
With a 19-3 lead, USC moved the ball to the Minnesota 35-yard line before a botched snap rolled back 35 yards and gave the Golden Gophers life. On the ensuing possession, tailback Duane Bennett ran the ball in for six and cut in to the USC lead.
Against Utah, three turnovers stopped USC from cruising to a comfortable victory. Up 10-0, Matt Barkley drove the Trojans to the Utes’ 21-yard line, but the drive ended in an interception. After the USC defense forced a punt, the offense drove the ball down to the Utah 12-yard line before fumbling and leaving points off the board again. Up 17-7 in the 3rd quarter, tight end Xavier Grimble fumbled while diving forward in Utah territory for extra yards.
USC has survived the negative turnover margin so far, but the schedule gets harder beginning this week. As the competition increases, the margin for error decreases, and the better USC is at winning the turnover battle, the better its record will be.

William Holder, the Ernst & Young Accounting Professor at USC, was installed as the sixth dean of the USC Leventhal School of Accounting on Tuesday evening during a reception at Town & Gown.
As the second person to receive the Alan Casden Dean Chair, Holder replaced Randolph Beatty, who stepped down last June after 10 years of service.
The ceremony was attended by deans of various USC schools, as well as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett and members of the Leventhal family.
“What this installation ceremony means is that all of these people honor Leventhal,” Holder said. “It signals the significance of this school and our ability to live up to the quality and pace of the other USC schools, which is very rapid.”
Holder was recognized by Accounting Today as one of the 100 most influential experts in the field of accounting in 2001 and 2002. Holder began teaching at USC in 1979, after teaching at Texas Tech University. A certified public accountant in both California and Oklahoma, he has published multiple books and journal articles featured in Journal of Accountancy, The Accounting Review and The CPA Journal.
Though the USC Leventhal School of Accounting’s undergraduate program has been ranked fourth in the nation by U.S. News & World Report, Holder is approaching his new position with a predetermined set of goals.
“In the coming years, we are most excited about establishing a state of the art curriculum that will be emulated by schools around the entire country,” Holder said “The aspirations of Leventhal are to provide intellectual leadership.”

The Dept. of Public Safety has had to relax areas of patrol in recent weeks, most notably areas of campus known for heavy bike traffic, in order to cope with an increase in property theft at USC.
Shifting gears · An increase in property theft around campus has forced LAPD and DPS to divert resources away from enforcing bicycle traffic rules on campus. - Daily Trojan file photo
There have been 18 more property incidents from Aug. 14 to Sept. 10 as compared with last year, but the overall property theft level in the area over the last year is down 5 percent, according to Los Angeles Police Department Lieutenant Darrell Belthius.
DPS has also noticed an increase in property theft through its analysis program, Comcast, which finds trends in crimes that occur over the course of a week, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
“The emphasis shift to property theft is the result of countless Comcast statistical analyses carried out by DPS every week,” Carlisle said. “For almost a year, we at DPS have seen a sharp spike in the statistical data concerning property theft, and most recently this trend has come up again — this kind of situation naturally stretches our resources.”
LAPD said it is imperative that police enforce bike laws and prevent property theft around campus.
“The main victims of property theft and biking incidents alike happen to be those uneducated about the proper course of action and subsequently those who are new and unaware to this unique environment [around USC],” Belthius said.
Carlisle said the recent increase in property theft comes from an increase in the number of students in the area at the start of the school year and crime should soon return to normal levels.
Carlisle said the shift in resources will benefit students in the long term.
“Bike accidents in the past week are mostly due to the sudden congestion in those areas and are very hard to prevent,” Carlisle said. “This emphasis shift will primarily impact students in a positive way as we hope to crack down on suspicious activity that may cause acts of theft within the USC community.”
Some students said it is appropriate for DPS and LAPD to focus on property theft given recent statistics.
“DPS should definitely be more active in patrolling for property theft activities,” said Aaron Childs, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance. “Physically being in the right place at the right time is key, and I feel if DPS had placed one officer in the area it would be such an effective deterrent.”
Mitch Kirner, a junior majoring in psychology, said DPS is correct to focus on property theft and limit enforcement of biking restrictions.
“I can understand the patrolling down Trousdale [Avenue] and nearby the quad,” Kirner said. “I can understand being ticketed in this zone but it shouldn’t really be anywhere else. There are more important things [DPS] could be doing.”
Some students, however, said DPS should still work to enforce biking rules.
“I recently got in a biking accident off a crosswalk and the police weren’t anywhere to be seen,” said Brandon Woodward, a sophomore majoring in popular music performance. “They need to make sure they are more active by patrolling all areas with equal importance for the safety of all students.”
Noah Tanski, a sophomore majoring in environmental science, said DPS officers should be more mobilized.
“I feel as if the resources should be used for more relevant purposes,” Tanski said. “A lot of incidents can be avoided if the majority of officers weren’t idle and only in one place.”
DPS and LAPD will continue to focus on property theft and remind students to lock their doors, hide their belongings in vehicles and be mindful not to display personal items in public for their own safety.
Both LAPD and DPS encourage attendance at their weekly seminars and urge students to comply with the recommended rules of safety to prevent property theft and bike accidents.
I’m glad to see that the university finally decided to allocate its security officials to positions where they might do some good.

The University of California system announced Friday a plan to increase tuition 8 to 16 percent annually over the next four years, a change that is expected to affect USC admissions.
If enacted, the proposal will affect the UC system’s ability to attract highly qualified students, USC Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said.
“The [UC] system has long been considered a very good value,” Brunold said in an email. “But now the challenge will be for it to find ways to offer a high-quality and engaging experience within an environment of tight budgets and increasing demand.”
Brunold also said the increase in tuition could challenge UC students, while more financially secure institutions would be able to directly assist  students in financing their educations.
“Considering the steady fee hikes in the [UC] system, I would imagine that there are more and more students attending those schools who will need aid,” Brunold said. “USC is fortunate to have one of the largest university-funded financial aid budgets in the country so our ability to help students financially is not dependent on government funding or other outside sources.”
This move was prompted by the recent reduction in funding by the state of California for the UC system. The UC system’s state funding fell by $650 million to about $2.37 billion this year.
This increase in tuition proposed by the UC system Board of Regents will be used to expand academic programs and hire new faculty, according to a statement made by the board.
This proposed increase could cause tuition at schools in the UC system to rise to more than $22,000 over four years.
Many students said the tuition hike might change the popularity of USC in the coming years.
“The [UC] schools are supposed to be cheaper [than private universities], but if they are more expensive then more people won’t want to go,” said Rosemary Bearden, an undeclared freshman. “In addition, they could get more personal attention at a private university for a similar cost.
The vote on the tuition hike and budget for the UC school system is scheduled for November 2011.
Good information. Important developments for all students.

Howard Gillman, dean of the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, has declined the offer to serve another term as dean, it was announced Monday.
Leaving · Dean Howard Gillman played an integral role in securing the $200-million naming donation from Dana and David Dornsife. - Daily Trojan file photo
Gillman served as the 20th dean of the school since 2007. Gillman will serve out the remainder of his current term, which ends at the end of this academic year.
Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett said Gillman resigned to focus on new challenges.
“He has told me that while he considers himself fortunate to have been able to lead his colleagues during these exciting times, he believes that after having spent eight years in important leadership roles at USC — as department chair, associate vice provost and dean — the time is right for him to explore new challenges and opportunities,” Garrett said in a memorandum sent to all USC Dornsife students.
Gillman joined the USC faculty in 1990 and has served as associate vice provost for research advancement and chair of the department of political science, in addition to being dean of USC Dornsife.
As dean, Gillman’s responsibilities have included overseeing USC Dornsife’s 33 academic departments and 31 research centers and institutes. Gillman has worked on recruiting new faculty, promoting innovation, expanding undergraduate opportunities to conduct research and increasing fundraising.
Under his leadership, USC Dornsife saw the creation of several interdisciplinary majors and minors, an increase in the graduation rate from 85 percent to 90 percent, the appointment of the first vice dean for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives and the creation of a number of new programs. Gillman worked to create a new block grant system for funding graduate programs, the Maymester and New Block Semester programs and the Student Opportunities for Academic Research and Summer Undergraduate Research Fund, respectively known as SOAR and SURF.
During his time as dean, USC Dornsife renewed the Center for Excellence in Genomic Sciences and the Southern California Earthquake Center. In 2010, the National Science Foundation funded the establishment of a $25 million Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations. External funding for research reached $76 million in 2010.
“Perhaps most notably, under his leadership, the College of Letters, Arts & Sciences received a transformative naming gift from Dana and David Dornsife,” Garrett said in a memorandum sent to all USC Dornsife students. “This gift of $200 million for unrestricted endowment is the largest single gift in the history of USC and the largest in the history of American higher education to name a college of arts and sciences.”
Garrett said Gillman will have overseen the recruitment of almost 100 new tenure-track faculty members across the humanities, social sciences and sciences by the end of this year.
Many students said Gillman has made a definite impact on USC.
“I think in those eight years he’s made a dramatic difference in the reputation of the college,” said Olivia Manayan, a junior majoring in neuroscience. “As a neuroscience major, I’ve been here three years and I’ve seen a dramatic change in my department. I would hope for the next dean to continue improving.”
Many hope Gillman will continue to create new programs that serve the undergraduate community during the rest of his term.
