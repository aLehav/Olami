The lights dimmed in the auditorium as the film began to play. Actress Amy Poehler’s face filled the projector screen as she interviewed a California domestic worker on her experiences in the new docuseries America Divided, produced by panelists Norman Lear, Solly Granatstein, Mark Greenberg and Leah Natasha Thomas. The filmmakers met on Wednesday in the Annenberg Auditorium to discuss the EPIX original docuseries.
The panel featured Lear, Granatstein, Greenberg and Thomas, as well as Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest Wilson III and Price School of Public Policy Dean Jack Knott. The panel was moderated by USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy Global Director Bonnie Reiss. 
The directors began the panel by explaining what they hoped the docuseries would accomplish. Greenberg explained that, instead of trying to provide a clear solution to current-day problems, they wanted instead to provide a new and unique perspective about people’s lives and conditions instead. 
“We were really trying to shed a light on what we saw as the critical issues plaguing society,” Granatstein said. “We weren’t trying to prescribe a solution because the issues are complicated. Instead, this project’s purpose was to show that the first part of bridging the gap is trying to understand the other side.”
Lear recalled his astonishment at learning Brooklyn’s low-income living conditions in comparison to the million-dollar apartments across town. 
“I had no idea that I would be so profoundly disturbed and informed from this project,” Lear said. “It isn’t until you’re standing in a $1.2 million apartment, learning that it was bought with money that was parked there by faceless international millionaires; and then later in the afternoon you’re sitting with 50 tenants who are being forced out by landlords who are doing everything they can to get them out there that you realize just the magnitude of the inequity in this country.” 
Having finished the production for the first season of America Divided, panelists reflected on the current political climate. Although most of them agreed that the average welfare of the American citizen has improved over the past decades, they also agreed that the country is now more divided than it was before. 
“The divide is deep, and it’s multifaceted,” Greenberg said. “And part of it is from people who feel left out, feel left behind, are angry and have decided to express that by voting for a conservative candidate. The other part is from people who feel left out, unheard, have lost hope in our political system and have as a result given up on voting. And because of that we have a gap in communication, in understanding.”
Moving forward, Lear and Greenberg offered myriad proposals to unite the country. Two of them included increased communication and increased empathy.
“What we’re doing here, causing conversation, is so important,” Lear said. “To look at this film and see and learn isn’t enough. To look at it and talk to someone and get the conversation going is critical to bridge the divide.”
Wilson explained that empathy sounds simple and cliche, but in reality it is difficult to achieve.
“One of the reasons we’re so divided politically is that we’re so stuck in our own pain, that we’re so stuck in our grievances that we really can’t deal with other people’s pain,” Wilson said. “And we tend to think of empathy as passive. But lately after having conversations with activists, I realized it takes a kind of courage to be empathetic.”

A USC alumnus has released a film that highlights the trends and problems surrounding hookup culture on college campuses.
Christopher Lakkees, who has an MBA from USC, was one of the producers of Liberated: Hookup Culture and the New Sexual Revolution. Lakkees said the film sought to highlight the trends that have led to a culture of sexual exploitation.
“Our film explores the cultural forces that are fueling the demand for prurient sex,” Lakkees said. “In Liberated: Hookup Culture and the New Sexual Revolution, we focus on Western culture. We examine a society where sex sells, where women are expected to conform to an idealized sexual image and where men are socialized to consume women for sex.”
The film explores the behavior of college students and their conformity to a hypersexualized culture. The filmmakers interviewed professionals and experts while following groups of college students on spring break and analyzing their behavior.
“We set out to create a film around interviewing college students on spring break asking what they felt their roles engendered in today’s society, including sexually,” Lakkees said. “During filming, we were quickly made aware of the fast transactional attitude around intimacy that was taking place termed hookup culture. We pivoted our focus from there, and followed the line to see where our discovery would lead. We then encountered what sociologists believe is behavior never caught on film before.” 
The film was directed by Benjamin Nolot, the president and founder of Exodus Cry, a Missouri-based organization that opposes human trafficking by raising awareness and reintegrating victims back into society. Nolot said he feels that the film is about telling an important story and disrupting the toxic misconduct on college campuses.
“It highlights some of the more concerning trends in terms of the sexual landscape of young adults on college campuses today,” Nolot said. “Through this film, we have the opportunity to draw attention to these concerns and start to see the culture change on college campuses.” 
Nolot said that the sources interviewed for the film include sociologists and one social worker, who helped provide perspective on the trends that are happening today.
“Sociologists started to coin the term ‘hookup culture’ because they started to see this phenomenon happen on college campuses where people were experiencing relationships primarily through a sexual encounter and maybe something would happen after that,” Nolot said. “But most relationships were starting through some type of sexual encounter.” 
The film will premiere at the Newport Beach Film Festival in April.

Despite a steady decline in neighborhood segregation in the United States since the 1970s, a new study conducted by a USC professor shows that white families with children typically live in less diverse areas than other racial groups, which could lead to damaging effects on their racial perceptions of race.
Katlyn Lee | Daily TrojanSource: 2010 U.S. Census data and 2009-2010 National Center for Education Statistics data
Ann Owens, an assistant professor in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, analyzed census data from 100 different cities to observe segregation in neighborhoods, finding that white children are exposed to slightly fewer minorities in their communities compared to white adults.
The study also discovered that school district boundaries play a major role in where families decide to locate, and that white families often choose where they live based on the racial makeup of local schools.
“White parents may be avoiding school districts where black and Latino children live because they use racial composition as a proxy for quality of a school and a neighborhood,” Owens said in an interview with USC News.
The implications of this study are far-reaching, Owens claims because children’ exposure to minorities influences their lives on a broad scale.
“A lack of diversity could have a significant effect on the development of their racial attitudes and future education and employment,” Owens said.
This higher rate of neighborhood segregation among white children also has significant effects on minority children, the study found. Prior research shows that low-income minority children tend to fall behind in educational and financial well-being when they live in segregated areas, and thus attend less integrated schools.
Los Angeles in particular suffers from segregation more than other similar cities, according to the study. In Miami, which has a similar demographic composition, schools and neighborhoods are significantly less segregated. The study suggested that this is likely because Miami has only one school district and parents are less concerned about which neighborhoods they live in, whereas Los Angeles’ school system is more fragmented and attendance largely depends on location.
For all you clowns getting mad at Daily Trojan writer Matt Ross for writing this article y’all need to shut up and you guys didn’t really understand or comprehend the article. 
I know where Ross is coming from and where this article is coming from. My brother told me a few years back and it’s something I’ll NEVER forget. And it is, “When white people feel threatened (be it crime, prevalence of minorities, and other threats) they move far away or insulate themselves around their own people.” 
This article goes along with what my brother said. Ross pointed out that many white parents in LA don’t want their kids going to school with Black and Latino kids, and in turn their kids miss out on diversity and learning about cultures other than their own. 
Look at the showbiz industry. Hollywood is chock full of white males and females in the directing, producing, writing, and studio heads professions, who grew up in white-dominated neighborhoods and had parents that weren’t interested in culturing them from childhood up until they left home for college. And in turn those same showbiz white male and females don’t know how to write for, produce for, or understand the Black, Latino, Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern, and other ethnic group’s cultures.
It’s cycle that begins at home. White people need to stop that racial segregation crap with that suburban living insularity. because it aint helping NOBODY, especially their own kids.
Blah blah blah.
Completely irresponsible writing. I edited far better articles from freshmen in high school. To pose this as white people avoiding black people based on racial preference is absurd. This is an issue of school choice for the disadvantaged and de facto segregation because of bad policy for the least fortunate among us. I never would run this piece if I was an editor with a semblance of credibility. Minorities have bad outcomes because they are forced to go to bad schools in bad areas, something I understand as a minority from south Chicago but something a privileged USC writer who can afford an extremely high tuition wouldn’t understand.
You need to wake up bruh. White people for decades behind closed doors and in public having doing what Ross pointed out in this article.   
And trust me. Los Angeles County is very segregated. The haves out here don’t want NOTHING to do with broke folks, bums, and other low-income people if they don’t have to even if it’s in philanthropic endeavors. 
Latinos (even the Americanized ones) in LA are VERY insulated in their own culture and race and want to be around they own people 24/7. Indians and Pakistani’s in LA want to be around they own people. Asians in LA don’t really want to have nothing to do with people outside they race, unless you buying products at they stores. Same with Armenians and other ethnic groups.
Segregation can go both ways. There’s even Blacks out here that don’t even like being around certain Blacks. West Los Angeles Blacks look down they nose at Blacks in the South Central Los Angeles area ALL THE TIME.
What a naive article.
You didn’t get the article much like everybody else on this p[age.
You are ignorant.
It seems “OTHER” makes up a decent chunk of those pie graphs and I assume OTHER isn’t white. So why are people coming to the conclusion that white kids are not interacting with minorities?

The School of Cinematic Arts will launch a partnership with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to financially support foreign filmmaking students through a $2 million endowment starting in Fall 2017.
Recipients of the gift will be dubbed HFPA International Scholars in efforts to promote international diversity and inclusivity. 
SCA Dean Elizabeth Daley and HFPA President Lorenzo Soria announced the establishment of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association Endowed International Student Support Fund on March 17. 
The fund, the largest donation exclusively in service of international students, will ensure that financial circumstances do not deter non-U.S. students from applying to or attending SCA due to a lack of financial aid. 
HFPA is a nonprofit organization, known for producing the annual Golden Globe Awards. The HFPA furthers entertainment-related charities and enterprises, including funding scholarships and educational programs for prospective film and television professionals. Soria lauded SCA as a fitting location for the inauguration of the international student fund due to its distinguished reputation in the entertainment world. 
“Tt has been our pleasure and honor for years to help hopeful storytellers and the industry leaders of tomorrow experience the best education, in hopes that they may pursue their dreams to share their stories and have their distinct voices heard,” Soria toldUSC News. 
Daley expressed gratitude and admiration to the HFPA for spearheading the inclusion initiative. 
“We are incredibly grateful to the Hollywood Foreign Press for this generous and impactful gift for international students,” Daley told USC News. “It will allow us to attract and fund the education of diverse storytellers from around the world, which is an important step toward enacting real change within our industry. Support like this is usually talked about but never instituted, so we are indebted to the HFPA for having the vision to actually do it. We look forward to seeing the global impact the HFPA International Scholars will make”

Most people see lemonade stands as images of a typical American childhood. But Lemonade Day USC, a business and community service organization on campus, is using lemonade sales to teach business skills.
Lemonade Day aims to inspire entrepreneurial spirit in today’s children by exposing them to real-world experiences with the help of mentors in their cities. The kids are taught the required skills to own their lemonade stand along with financial responsibility and teamwork. At USC, this culminates in an annual Lemonade Day event, which will be held on April 8 this year — in which kids sell lemonade to members of the community. 
“It is not only just hard skills but it is the soft skills too, like teaching them confidence and being able to look into a customer’s eye,” said Michelle Wolzinger, founder of Lemonade Day USC. “It is different from other programs because at Lemonade Day, they are putting everything they learn into practice and starting their actual first business.”
Wolzinger, a senior majoring in business administration, started Lemonade Day USC in 2015, the first of its kind in Southern California. During Wolzinger’s freshman year at George Washington University, she had participated in the university’s chapter, and when she transferred to USC her sophomore year, she decided to bring the club to campus.
 Since Wolzinger studies business entrepreneurship, she said that teaching the kids business skills along with financial literacy and investments has been fulfilling. Last spring, she was able to recruit 60 mentors, including an executive board of 10 people. 
Lemonade Day USC interacts mostly with second to sixth graders across schools in the University Park Campus area. They interacted with over 200 students from three schools in 2016 and currently visit Foshay Learning Center and 32nd Street School once a week, according to Wolzinger.
“We start with something simple like a lemonade stand but a lot of the skills that we are teaching them and hopefully they are picking up would be able to translate into other aspects of their lives,” Lemonade Day USC Director Brian Walsh said.
Worldwide, nearly 1 million kids from elementary and middle schools in countries including Canada and South Africa are aided by Lemonade Day volunteers.
Every Thursday, Walsh goes to the Foshay Learning Center, where he interacts with second graders and takes the kids through an interactive workbook that teaches them how to create plans, set goals, make the lemonade stand, advertise and keep an account of the numbers.
“It’s something that we look forward to as mentors,” Walsh said. “Every time we go there, they are jumping out of their seats happy and they are so bummed when we are leaving.”
However, according to Wolzinger, sometimes they come across kids who are not interested or have a short attention span and see it as playtime. That is when the mentors face the challenge to try and keep the kids engaged through the workbooks.
Emily Lowe, a sophomore majoring in business administration and the vice president of university relations at Lemonade Day USC, has been a part of it since her freshman year and loves working with kids.
“I am super interested in entrepreneurships and I think it is so cool that we can introduce this to kids at such a young age, and it is a valuable experience to them,” Lowe said.
Lowe became excited because some kids don’t have a mentor in their lives and she could make a positive impact on them through Lemonade Day. Lowe leads the recruiting process and helps with the formal training of the mentors. She is also helping plan a field trip in the coming year for the students that they are mentoring.
As the vice president of external relations and fundraising at Lemonade Day USC, Walsh — along with the other members of the executive board — organized an Indiegogo campaign last year to raise money for the organization. According to Walsh, they are currently concentrating on reaching out to corporations including local banks, car dealerships and grocery chains. They have a safe stand location, a place where kids can set up their lemonade stands, so that the kids are around trusted individuals who make them feel safe and comfortable.
Though Wolzinger is moving to Japan once she graduates in May and will no longer be involved with Lemonade Day, she hopes that more people will support and sustain the organization. She believes seeing the reaction that the children have to Lemonade Day can inspire college students to help out the community.
“I just saw the kids’ faces light up, and they were very inspired to be working with college students,” Wolzinger said. “Their eyes lit up when they found out that they could actually make money and keep it for themselves.”

With only a couple of weeks until the 2017 NFL Draft in Philadelphia, scouts flocked to Cromwell Field to get a closer look at the Trojans’ 2017 Draft class. As teams begin to narrow their focus, players got another opportunity to show why they’re worthy of a spot in the NFL.
Stars Shine Bright 
Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and cornerback Adoree’ Jackson were the two marquee players on display at USC’s Pro Day. Satisfied with their 40-yard dash times at the NFL Combine, the two former USC stars sat out the 40 at Pro Day. At the combine, Smith-Schuster ran his 40 in 4.54 seconds and Jackson ran his in 4.42 seconds. Both players found other ways to impress the scouts in attendance. Both showed quickness in the shuttle run and cone drill exercises and made dazzling plays in positional drills. 
Smith-Schuster didn’t drop a single pass in the workout and made a couple of highlight reel grabs, followed by the trademark dancing fans had grown accustomed to.
“There was no pressure,” Smith-Schuster said. “The huge difference between the combine and here is that you’re out here with your boys. At the end of the day, ball is ball.” 
The relaxed atmosphere certainly seemed to help both Jackson and Smith-Schuster, who impressed scouts with their athleticism. Jackson, who is using his versatility to his advantage in the draft process, worked with coaches on his return game. At one point Jackson fielded a punt while holding three other balls. 
While it remains to be seen where they will get drafted, both players seemingly improved their draft stock today with impressive performances and poise while handling tough questions. 
Impressive Performances
Outside of the Trojans’ big name stars, there were other impressive performances at Pro Day as scouts tried to look for value pickups via the draft or undrafted free agency. The surprise of the day was wide receiver Isaac Whitney, who posted a blistering 4.41 40-yard dash time. Running back Justin Davis wasn’t too far behind Whitney with a time of 4.49 seconds. 
Davis, who is trying to prove his value as an all-purpose back, spent a lot of time catching passes and demonstrated solid route running and catching skills. In the weight room, defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu posted an impressive 33 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press. 
Wide receiver De’Quan Hampton had an all-around solid day after posting the highest vertical of 41.5 inches, running a 4.66-second 40 and recording 21 reps on the bench. Hampton appeared to pull up on his right hamstring in his second run of the 40, but played through pain the in the position drills. 
Wide receiver Darreus Rogers and tight end Taylor McNamara, two of the Trojans’ most reliable pass catchers in 2016, made some nice grabs in the passing section. Offensive linemen Damien Mama, Chad Wheeler, Zach Banner and Jordan Simmons were put through a tough workout on the side, testing their lateral movement, footwork and hand speed. 
For players that weren’t extended invites to the combine, Pro Day was a great opportunity to show scouts what they have to offer an NFL club. 
Familiar faces return
In a large contingent of NFL scouts and coaches, former USC head coach and current Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll got most of the attention. Since his departure for the NFL, Carroll has seemingly held onto his USC roots. He spent a considerable amount of time talking to Athletic Director Lynn Swann and head coach Clay Helton. Norm Chow, a former USC offensive coordinator under Carroll, was in attendance as well. Also taking in Pro Day were general managers Reggie McKenzie of the Oakland Raiders and Doug Whaley of the Buffalo Bills.

On a brisk afternoon at Merle Norman Stadium, the No. 1 USC beach volleyball team took care of business in their home opener. The Trojans defeated visiting Loyola Marymount 5-0 in the first meeting between the two teams this season. With the win, the Trojans improved to 12-0 on the season with a 42-match winning streak, while LMU fell to 6-7 overall. Furthermore, USC remains perfect in the all-time series against the Lions at 16-0.
To kick off the dual meet, USC got 2 points on the board from their No. 4 and No. 5 pairs, respectively. Sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis earned a 21-16, 25-23 victory over LMU’s Emma Doud and Veronica Nederend, while the second point came from juniors Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer at the five spot. After dropping their first set 18-21 to LMU’s pair of Kristen Castellanos and Erin Williams, the reigning Pac-12 Pair of the Week squeaked out wins in the next two frames, 21-17 in the second and 15-12 in the third.
Belton and Kremer are no stranger to three-setters in this early part of the season, having gone the distance in six of their 11 matches played. However, with an overall record of 10-1 and an eight-match winning streak in their back pockets, the juniors seemed to have fully embraced those challenges.
“It’s almost become kind of a joke between us at this point,” Kremer said. “We’ve gone to three so many times now that if we do end up having to play another third set, we just sit down, regroup and tell each other that we’ll be fine. We’re good at third games and we feed off each other really well.”
While the juniors are one of four new pairs for USC this season, their friendship has quickly transformed into a solid partnership at the five spot.
“We have very similar personalities on the court, which helps us a lot,” Belton said. “We’re known to be very relaxed and chill, but we can definitely bring the fire out of each other when we need to, so it has been working really well.”
That bond also contributes to the players’ comfort levels when taking on competitors.
“I love playing with Jenna,” Kremer added. “We don’t really feel too much pressure out on the court because we know we’ll have the other’s support no matter what. It’s been really fun so far.”
Once the four and five pairs wrapped up their victories, it became a race to see which USC pair would clinch the dual for the Trojans. Over on court three, junior Terese Cannon set up senior Nicolette Martin for a kill that would end the match and the dual in the Trojans’ favor. They posted a 21-15, 21-15 win over Brittnay Estes and Kekai Whitford. Less than a minute later, senior Allie Wheeler and sophomore Katrina Kernochan — playing in place of senior Sophie Bukovec — notched a 21-11, 21-19 straight set victory over Sara Kovac and Jessie Prichard on court two.
To close out the 5-0 sweep, the Trojans got a win at the top court from seniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes. After dropping the first set to LMU’s pair of Savannah Slattery and Sarah Sponcil 18-21, the veterans dominated the second frame by a 21-10 score. Claes and Hughes then ran out to a 10-1 lead in the third and took the set in dominating fashion with a 15-3 finish. All in all, the dual victory improved USC’s record to 35-4 all-time at Merle Norman Stadium.
From the West Coast to the East Coast the Trojans go, as they now head to Columbia, S.C., for the Gamecock Grand Slam-Dan Apol Memorial tournament at Wheeler Beach for the weekend. The field includes No. 4 Florida State, No. 9 Georgia State, host and No. 9 South Carolina and No. 13 Stetson. Matches will begin on Saturday at 8 a.m. PST with a tilt against the Seminoles and will conclude on Sunday.

Last Saturday’s primetime NBA game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers was overshadowed. No, the culprit wasn’t the NCAA Tournament. It was the fact that a game that — on paper — featured the likes of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love duking it out against Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan … well, didn’t.
As a sold-out Staples Center and nationwide audience on ABC tuned into the game, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue rested his Big Three of James, Irving and Love, setting the stage for a 30-point Clippers blowout. By the fourth quarter, fans expecting a clash of Eastern and Western Conference titans were stuck watching the likes of Kay Felder and Raymond Felton run out the clock.
This was the second consecutive Saturday night game (the marquee NBA matchup of the week) that suffered from resting superstars. On March 13, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr sat Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, and the star-less Warriors rolled over versus San Antonio in an 85-107 drubbing. 
The game fell 12 percent in ratings and 5 percent in viewership from the same Warriors-Spurs matchup in 2016. The tilt in Los Angeles seven days later was even worse, tying the record for lowest-rated NBA game ever on broadcast television. 
So, on Tuesday, NBA commissioner Adam Silver sent a memo out to league owners.
“Decisions of this kind do not merely implicate issues of player health and team performance on the court,” the memo said. “They also can affect fans and business partners, impact our reputation and damage the perception of our game. With so much at stake, it is simply not acceptable for Governors to be uninvolved or to defer decision-making authority on these matters to others in their organizations.”
Silver essentially asked owners to step in and make sure coaches and players can’t hurt the NBA’s product by periodically resting superstars en masse. The response to the memo was predictable. Cleveland general manager David Griffin insisted it wasn’t his responsibility to prioritize television partners.
“They’re paying me to win a championship,” Griffin said. “I’m not overly concerned about the perception of it. We literally had one guy rest tonight, and everybody else was reasonably injured, so I don’t feel like we did anything terribly egregious.”
As a sports fan, my knee-jerk reaction was to side with Griffin in this debate. After all, we gripe when our favorite teams don’t trade for a player or don’t spend enough money in free agency because we want that championship. We get angry over hirings and firings because we say it doesn’t give the team the best chance to win. 
So then how can we complain about preserving star players for the playoff run, when they will be needed most? Sure, it stinks to see James or Curry on the bench in March, but does it really matter as long as they’re playing every minute come May and June? It shouldn’t.
And though I stand by that principle, I also can’t bring myself to agree with Griffin’s words. Because history shows that NBA championships aren’t won by taking a handful of games off during the regular season; in fact, many all-time greats have lifted the Larry O’Brien Trophy after being iron men from October through June. Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant combined for 11 rings during their careers, and they started the full 82-game regular season slate in five of those championship-winning seasons, starting 80 games or more in seven. Jordan actually played all 246 regular-season tilts from 1995-1998 while winning three championships in three seasons — and this run began when Jordan was 32.
The 32-year-old James, meanwhile, has only reached the 80-game threshold twice in his career, last in 2009: the penultimate year of his first stint with the Cavaliers. He also hasn’t logged a 3,000-minute season since his debut season in Miami in 2010, while Jordan only failed to do so in three of his 15 NBA seasons— even completing a 2,709-minute campaign in his age-39 campaign.
Why does James require more rest than Jordan did? It’s ludicrous to say James is physically inferior (I mean, just look at the guy), and one player’s injury history doesn’t stand out over the other’s. It simply doesn’t make sense that Jordan was able to endure that much wear and tear in a more primitive era of sports medicine while James — and his fellow NBA superstars — can’t do so today.
At the end of the day, it boils down to this: James and other stars demand the occasional day off. And hey, who am I to judge? Basketball is a job for these people, and you can’t blame them for calling in sick every once in a while to sit around all day watching sports.
It is frustrating, though, to hear selfish decisions framed as selfless ones. Reports after Saturday’s game suggested James had been irked at being benched but accepted his coach’s decision. Considering James pushed former coach David Blatt out of Cleveland last season, it seems unlikely he lets Lue call his shots, especially when it comes to his spot in the lineup.
Griffin was right: Teams’ personnel decisions should be based on winning, not the whims of TV stations. But he is also wrong: The Cavaliers’ decision to rest their stars on Saturday was not based on winning. 
If it had been, James and company would have likely taken a seat on Sunday against the Lakers, who Cleveland would have a better chance of beating without its stars. And with the Cavs nursing just a two-game lead over Boston atop the Eastern Conference, they could have used an extra win in Los Angeles. 
Alas, Cleveland’s stars chose to rest, and to be honest, that doesn’t really matter to fans (it doesn’t take much effort to flip the channel). But don’t pop a squat on the bench and tell us you’re ultimately doing it for a championship — that is simply false. Just relax and enjoy your day off.

Faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous and ambitious: These are the five traits that embody the spirit of a Trojan. For Katherine Berry, a senior majoring in business administration, being a Trojan does not stop at these five traits. To Berry, the identity of a Trojan also means community, empowerment and
contributing to the Trojan family.
Like many other students, Berry found her niche on campus early in her USC career through her extracurricular activities and organizations, such as the Spirit of Troy, Society 53 and working as an admissions center tour guide. Although Berry has an impossibly full plate of activities, she manages her time effectively through prioritization.
On top of her already hectic daily schedule, Berry still finds time to create videos for her college lifestyle YouTube channel, Katherout, which has over 90,000 subscribers.
During the summer between eighth and ninth grade, Berry
began her internet career out of boredom and UGG boots. As any sensible buyer would, Berry looked up photos of the UGG boots she wanted to buy. However, no matter how hard she looked, there just weren’t very many photos of them online — until she came across a YouTube haul video of a 13 year-old girl who was showcasing her UGG boots.
“I was just so entranced that she was showing everything she had bought at the mall and that I was watching it for 12 minutes and was fully entertained,” Berry said.
Before this, Berry had never really watched or used YouTube frequently.
Fascinated by an online interest in haul videos, Berry felt she could do the same.
“I was like, ‘I could totally do this,’” Berry said. “I just started making videos on topics I knew. It could be just advice. It could be my morning routine of how I get ready for school. I did a lot of academically oriented videos.”
Just like that, her YouTube channel, Katherout, was born. Katherout soon grew in fame from Berry’s vlogs of college life, advice from personal experiences and taboo topics unheard of in college.
“College was really where the identity of my channel was shaped and formed, and I grew a lot because people really don’t know what college is like,” Berry said.
Berry values her ability to give an accurate lens of the college experience to help high school students decide what they are looking for in a school. Each video is sparked by a demand for videos that don’t already exist on YouTube.
“The main goal is to create content that I would need, so I’m always looking to make videos that I have searched for before but have never shown up,” Berry said.
Throughout her experience at USC, Berry acknowledged that her YouTube channel has been the differentiating experience that sets her apart from other Trojans. Not only has Berry’s channel been a conversation starter, but it has also been a platform for her to recruit future Trojans who don’t have the opportunity to experience campus for themselves.
“I think YouTube has made me feel more fulfilled in college because I’m able to make the most of my time here,” Berry said.
Though Katherout has made her feel like a celebrity on campus, Berry never forgets that her education always comes before YouTube. She values YouTube as her necessary creative outlet and way to express herself beyond her academics.
“I’m not a YouTuber in college. I’m a college YouTuber because college comes first and YouTube comes second,” Berry said.
Outside of academics, Berry has been involved with the Spirit of Troy all three years of her college career. She knew that she definitely wanted to continue music in college.
She was instantly drawn to the marching band when watching them perform at an ExploreSC event and knew that she would join. After years of performing with the band at gigs and football games all over the country, Berry ended her last game in the best way possible: the Rose Bowl.
“Going from the Rose parade to the Rose Bowl was a lot of emotion,” Berry said. “But ultimately, [it was] the most rewarding experience because it was the culmination of all the hours I put into marching band. [It was] worth it because we obviously ended up winning.” 
Berry, who graduates this semester, offered her advice to freshmen: Never be intimidated. She believes that students can only truly acclimate to classes and the environment by having communities of people within clubs and organizations on campus.
After graduation, in addition to working for Adobe in San Francisco, Berry hopes to continue creating content for her YouTube channel but is also looking forward to challenging herself to create a podcast interviewing successful women in the Bay Area about their failures.
For her bittersweet weeks left before graduation, Berry is looking forward to soaking up all the sunshine she can, especially in a hammock in McCarthy Quad. Even after leaving USC, Katherine Berry knows she will be a Trojan for life.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
As the youngest sibling in a family of musicians, Paul Cornish had big shoes to fill when he began playing piano at age five. It was slow going at first, but Cornish credits his current drive for music to a host of mentors who encouraged him at a young age.
“I really hated piano at first,” Cornish said. “I just wanted to play drums.”
Cornish, now a junior majoring in jazz studies, is one of the most zealous musicians in our department. I couldn’t believe there was a time when Cornish needed encouragement — let alone coercion — to practice. But Cornish maintained that it took until middle school for him to take ownership of his identity as a musician.
“It was when I found out what jazz was that I really became interested in the possibilities of music and the piano,” he said. “I was doing classical piano all the way up until seventh grade.” 
Then, his friend, who was the pianist in the middle school jazz band, left. Cornish found himself filling in the empty spot. 
Cornish had to quickly adjust to jazz’s unique challenges. He signed up for a five-week summer jazz camp in Houston to catch up with the other musicians in his school’s band. There, he had what he called a life-changing musical experience: A friend played him a record by contemporary jazz pianist Robert Glasper. The sound of that record set humming Cornish’s deepest convictions about the meaning of freedom.
“I’ve always been interested in choice and in why things are the way they are,” Cornish said. “I’ve always been interested in artists that live differently — on purpose.”
Before hearing Glasper, Cornish hadn’t felt such a sense of individuality in music. Indeed, that hour unsettled many of the assumptions that had kept him away from jazz before.
“I had heard jazz before, and it was traditional: It was the stock jazz style, which I grew to love later on,” Cornish said. “But Robert Glasper — to me he was breaking down barriers. He was choosing to do stuff differently, in terms of how he soloed and the forms of his songs.”
Cornish told me he still draws his musical philosophy from Glasper eight years later. For Cornish, good music must both embody and engender freedom. 
“I want people to feel like they can do anything,” Cornish said. “I hope, through how I play and how I interact with my band, that it has some factor of that, like, ‘Man, that was different’ … I want people to get angry because it was different and they didn’t like it, just because it went in a different direction.”
And he meant it. Cornish has always impressed me with his daredevil musical decisions and how eagerly he receives criticism. 
“Is this fearlessness a choice or a response to an urge? What is the psychological sensation?” I asked.
“I always want to try to take the music somewhere else, and maybe push the people I’m playing with to get out of cliches or going on autopilot,” he said. “I want to try and encourage everyone to be open, or to take this music somewhere else than where we automatically think it should go.”
Cornish recently launched his own trio, and he said it has given him the opportunity to explore these psychological dimensions of music, whereas before he was focused on perfecting his technique.
He started his trio after receiving encouragement from Glasper, his idol.
“I saw [Glasper] when he was in town, and he asked, ‘Do you have a trio going?’ … In school, we get caught up in the classroom aspect of it, but there’s another side to performing, and that takes shedding [practicing] of its own,” Cornish said.
Taking Glasper’s advice to heart, Cornish’s trio now plays monthly shows at Nature’s Brew, honing their ability to interact with each other and an audience that may be new to jazz.
“Does it feel good?” I asked.
“Definitely, especially when you’ve been writing music — you always dream of the day that you can premiere it and people respond to it,” Cornish said. “To play with other musicians that are on the same wavelength, in terms of your thoughts about music, and who are willing to try things — yeah, it’s a beautiful thing. And I can’t ask for anything more.”

Los Angeles-based trio Tashaki Miyaki uses its gentle guitar and smooth-as-silk voices in their debut album, The Dream, which will be released on April 7. Like many artists, the group is greatly inspired by the city that is its home; its musical style effectively conveys the sad beauty hidden in the crevices of Los Angeles.
Its music has been described as “soothing feelings of sadness and gut-wrenching despair” — an accurate depiction of the entire album. Tashaki Miyaki’s poetic lyrics, combined with hauntingly playful guitar melodies, create a somber yet settling listening experience. Tashaki Miyaki has the ability to cause the listener’s suppressed, emotive feelings to resurface, while still staying relaxed -— the beat encourages one to sway to the music.
In an interview with Vice, the band says that one of its greatest influences is Neil Young, fondly calling him “Uncle Neil.” The acoustic influences of Young are vividly clear in all its songs, especially in the constant guitar presence. The band members also cite Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as a strong mentor. 
Because of the chilling melodies that underlay the words, the lyrics in almost every song seem applicable to those with any sort of broken heart or disappointment. “Girls on TV” is a commentary on the L.A. phenomenon of creating a new identity to be universally liked, yet the lyrics “I don’t believe in anything / Won’t you please adore me?” can be applied to listeners of all ages and experiences.
Tashaki Miyaki’s well-received self-named EP established its presence in the acoustic-indie sector. With a few songs with the same lilting essence, the album seemed to be predictable and a relatively unexciting continuation of its EP. However, stumbling upon “Facts of Life,” which traded in the band’s acoustic sound for a heavier, more energetic electric guitar, makes it clear that this band has the potential to move beyond the melancholy melodies to which it is often attached. This aggressive, rock-pop song is the album’s equivalent of an angry, angsty teenager who wants to take control of their life. The brooding lyrics make a reappearance, the band singing, “You could’ve been first, but now you’re 16th in line. Oh my, we’re all going to die.” 
“Keep Me in Mind” swings back across the pendulum to the soft-pop, conjuring the essence of a
melancholy Echosmith or Passenger. This track, along with “Facts of Life” and “LAPD,”
grazes the tip of the iceberg of the innovation and growth that the band is capable of producing. In the future, Tashaki Miyaki will be most successful if it continues to develop from its EP. The band has shown that it has the ability to be experimental, and successfully so, but if it doesn’t continue on the path of new and creative, the band could lose the interest of its fan base. 
Imagine a flickering marquee sign on Sunset Boulevard — that is the visual aesthetic of Tashaki Miyaki and The Dream. Pulling directly from the blood and soul of Los Angeles, Tashaki Miyaki sings out these heartbroken ballads for the disillusioned. Not an everyday listen for most, The Dream is suitable for nights when all existential crises and dark thoughts come bubbling up.

On March 1, the Georgia House of Representatives passed House Bill 51, which would not only place limits on colleges’ ability to investigate reports of sexual assault, but also require all cases of campus sexual assault to be reported to law enforcement. 
The bill, which is still pending before the Georgia Senate’s Judiciary Committee, is already drawing fierce criticism from advocates for sexual assault survivors for the deeply detrimental effects it will have on survivors’ rights and pursuit of justice. Let’s call out HB 51 for what it is: a mechanism of control, plain and simple.
In many cases, sexual assault is rooted in the domination and subjugation of women, and of course, above all, the trivialization of choice and consent. HB 51 builds upon these themes by denying survivors determinism in how they pursue justice and requiring them to face law enforcement’s often unnecessarily invasive investigative process.
There’s a reason that experts and activists condemn requirements for reporting campus sexual assault cases to law enforcement. Such policies correlate with lower rates of reporting and, subsequently, lower rates of justice for survivors. It’s not uncommon for survivors to suffer from PTSD from their experiences or, at the very least, to feel uncomfortable being intensely questioned about deeply traumatic experiences and forced to relive the assault. 
Law enforcement is notorious for subtly practicing victim-blaming in their treatment of survivors by typically asking irrelevant, undeniably sexist questions regarding female victims’ state of dress or behavior, shifting responsibility from male attackers to the female victims. It’s no surprise that some women who experience sexual assault would rather not be involved with police officers, who could very well either pin them with the trite, classic “asking for it” label or worse, brush them off as liars. In the same vein, male survivors may also be discouraged from reporting due to rigid and unforgiving standards for masculinity and sexist notions that it’s somehow impossible for men, too, to be sexually violated.
All of this relates back to HB 51, of course, because the bill would require anyone who wishes to report their experiences to university administration to also report to and cooperate with the police, regardless of whether or not they’re comfortable doing so. 
But long before HB 51 was introduced and passed through the Georgia House of Representatives, and long before Education Secretary Betsy DeVos refused to promise to uphold current federal guidelines granting survivors more legal rights and autonomy in January, rape culture has systemically undermined and denied survivors determinism in how they choose to come forward, or of course, not come forward.
By requiring survivors, who have already been subjected to unspeakable abuse, to fit into a seamless narrative that is often a rigid caricature of patriarchal demands of women, we have given them no choice but to either model their behavior according to ignorant, unfair expectations of them, or face disbelief and even blame. 
By regarding survivors with relentless skepticism, rape culture and the stereotypical narrative it requires of survivors  ignores how low rates of dishonest reporting, estimated by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center to be just between 2 and 10 percent, are, and fails to acknowledge just how fundamentally different sexual assault is from any other sort of crime.
It’s not as if survivors are in a state of mind permitting them to collect evidence and immediately, without any hesitation, proceed to report their experiences. It may be no burden to call the police immediately after realizing one has been robbed, but for a possibly PTSD-afflicted sexual assault survivor who may be terrified of being blamed and ruthlessly unraveled by law enforcement’s stereotyping and scrutiny, it can take a good amount of time to be able to come forward — if they choose to at all. 
Given these circumstances, in an ideal society, we would accept Obama administration federal guidelines, which lowered the standards of evidence required of survivors of assault, as reasonable; we would accept some lapses in time before reporting as reasonable; we would accept survivors’ choice to come forward only to a confidential panel at their university as reasonable.
But instead, we live in a society in which a dozen women could come forward after audio of President Donald Trump admitting — verbatim — to habitually “grab” women “by the p-ssy” without consent, and accuse the same man of sexually abusing them, only to be disbelieved because they didn’t immediately report their experiences. Perhaps they would have, if they believed there was any chance their claims would be taken seriously without a confession from Trump’s own lips, but even with this confession, their narratives were picked apart for other reasons ranging from petty to plain misogynistic.
And arguably worse, we live in a society in which one young woman could literally have people witness her rape, report to law enforcement immediately and still watch helplessly as her assailant, Stanford rapist Brock Turner, spends just three months in county jail for his actions. 
This is the society we live in — one that gives women virtually zero reason to believe reporting their assault will be a positive experience for them or that their bravery and resilience in doing so will necessarily yield positive results. But as the unsettling early success of HB 51 reveals, we live in a society that will force them to report their experiences to law enforcement nonetheless.

How the fuck could anyone share this? I’ve been raped twice in high school and once in college. As a man, I understand the gravity of this issue. But I also have a cousin who has been falsely accused of sexual assault and kicked out of school for it (his ex was jealous that he slept with another girl a few days after they broke up so she made up a story). Schools shouldn’t handle this shit. Anyone who actually supports survivors of this terrible crime should advocate for them to be locked up, not kicked out of school under an extremely low burden of proof. You wasted money on an education.

A recent spate of campus protests — namely, a particularly contentious  response to conservative author Charles Murray, who spoke at Middlebury College on March 1 —  has broken new ground in think pieces penned by older Americans. These criticisms serve to revitalize the long tradition of deploring colleges’ descents into so-called “safe spaces” and college students’ penchants for bubble-wrapping themselves against ideas they deem unpleasant. The country’s young people, these writers argue, have become too soft, narrow-minded and idealistic in believing that they can use protest to eliminate opinions they don’t agree with.
In his recent piece “The Dangerous Safety of College,” New York Times columnist Frank Bruni writes: “The moral of the recent melee at Middlebury College, where students shouted down and chased away a controversial social scientist, isn’t just about free speech, though that’s the rubric under which the ugly incident has been tucked. It’s about emotional coddling. It’s about intellectual impoverishment.”
Coddling? One is forced to wonder if Bruni understands how condescending and close-minded his phrasing is. No one is being coddled in this day and age, except perhaps a certain demographic of people who have never had to worry about ingrained prejudice against them. College students are as angry and afraid as everyday Americans. How can they be pillowed and safe when they remain rooted in the real and terrifying arena of American politics, fearing deportation for themselves and their families, fearing lack of access to health care, fearing that they will not be able to re-enter the United States and fearing violence against themselves for the color of their skin? Separated from their parents and hometown communities, students are being thrust into a political reality alone for the first time. 
When a speaker like Murray comes to Middlebury College, with his history of asserting that a biological intelligence gap exists between white and black people, students have a right to be angry (though, it should be noted, not a right to cause injury). This is because college is not a vacuum. College is not a bubble; rather, it is a microcosm of reality, a practice for the real battle to come. Universities are not windowless compounds where students remain closed off from the outside world for four years. The fact remains: Students work in cities, involve themselves in political campaigns, read and write the news and travel to experience the cultures of foreign countries. Many students pay their own tuition. Some students have families to take care of.
It is impossible to live in a soft, liberal-only environment when students receive CNN alerts several times a day about the incompetent president’s every move, read reports about mass shootings and police brutality and are constantly bombarded with the violent targeting of brown Americans due to their race. This environment cannot be a bubble when  refugees are told that the American dream is not for them, the city of Flint still lacks access to clean water, transgender Americans are denied the basic dignity of using the bathroom, Planned Parenthood is defunded and steep limitations to abortion persist.
Campus protest is less about crafting a “safe space” than about utilizing vigor and collective passion to organize against a set of ideas that are so clearly backward. And to ask college students to be quiet — moreover, that they politely let Murray talk: That implies inaction. And this is dangerous territory to tread. Because where, then, does this being quiet turn into something far more lethal: passivity? If university life is preparation for the real world, and students are to tolerate these ideas now in their four years, then where does this take them when they graduate? If they are taught to be quiet now, when will it be acceptable for them to speak up? 
If older Americans have the gall to lecture college students on respect and open-mindedness, want to tell them to sit down and shut up and receive the well-rounded higher education they paid for, then they at least should give students the credit of using the education they’ve received. College students are informed and intelligent, rhetorical and incisive. They will not tolerate hatred, will not give hateful people a platform and will continue to protest bigotry with all the force of the intellectual and argumentative tools they have been given. 
University students were taught to use their words to argue. They were educated about global revolutions and the promise of the people. They took decades worth of history and social studies classes, read dozens of books warning against fascism and authoritarianism and Big Brother. And throughout it all, they were tested on and evaluated upon their abilities to apply this material. So now, when it is time to reflect on the most important lessons learned in college — the skill of speaking and arguing one’s own opinion — they are told to hold back, rethink, delve once again into hypothesis and theory?
How dare anyone restrain them. Older Americans gave these students their education, and now they must contend with a reality in which students finally take it upon themselves to apply it. 
It is a highly narrow-minded and pretentious perspective to paint college students as soft, liberal babies who cannot even stand to hear opinions that disagree with them. No. The threat of the real world — with all its bigotry and hate — does not end at the university gate. And after almost two decades of sitting in classrooms and being given detentions for talking out of hand, college students owe it to no one to continue to practice their listening skills, especially when applied to speech that denigrates themselves and those they love. Students owe it to no one to tolerate and listen to hatred, least of all themselves. 
Perhaps those who propose that hate speech be allowed to exist on campus should look inside themselves and determine their own motivation for wanting students to tolerate and listen to reprehensible rhetoric such as that of Murray. Just as the world will not benefit from offering platforms to hateful speakers, so, too, does it go for colleges. Whose mind will be enlightened, pray tell, if he or she just takes the time to respect and listen to Murray or former Breitbart Editor Milo Yiannopoulos or someone in the vein of White House chief adviser Stephen Bannon or white nationalist Richard Spencer?
Of course, protests that utilize violence should never be tolerated. Nor should the starting of fires, the vandalism of buildings or the injuring of people. But intellectual and rhetorical peaceful protest, arguments that stem from deeply held values and that challenge personal beliefs — that is what college is for. That is what life is for. And if older Americans want to sit in the real world and pretend that college students exist outside of it, then they should at least give students the credit of practicing the skills they’ve been taught and conditioned with for 20 years.
Don’t attach your name to such inane articles if you want a career in journalism. Looks like you’ll be unemployable outside of Gawker. 
If the writer is to be believed, a significant portion of students at Middlebury face constant police harassment and deportation on a daily basis, a fantasy she somehow connects to Charles Murray.  Here I was thinking they were in one of the most elite institutions on earth, complete with great food, cushy dorms, gyms, pools and well paid campus cops, luxuries unimaginable to 99% of humans.  I wonder if people really knew how rough things got at Middlebury they would still drop $60,000/year to send their little ones there.
Children, kids, late teenagers who have yet to work and live in the real world, enjoy your time in college. Learn as much as you can! Learn your facts and stand your grounds! Dream big and live your dreams! This is what the 1st Amendment is all about. Fight on! Never quit!
Actually, yes… Students do have to tolerate hateful speakers on campus.  After all, the measure of one’s tolerance is not determined by their acceptance of what they agree with, but what they disagree with.  
The real question here is the definition of “hateful”.  For Democrats, it’s basically anything or anyone who disagrees with them.  They think you are hateful if you believe immigrants should come here legally, or face deportation.  They blame everyone except the illegal immigrant for the separation of families or other consequences of coming here illegally.  They think it’s hateful if you actually believe marriage is something straight people do by definition. They think you’re hateful if you think models should be uniquely attractive and not average…or Downs Syndrome or overweight.  They think you’re hateful if you harbour any fear or reserve with respect to the Islamic faith in the face of global terrorism by rogue Muslims.  They think you’re hateful if you think the Muslim practice of wearing a hajib is antithetical to America’s and Western civilization’s view on women’s liberties.  They think you’e hateful if you refuse to accept the lie that humans can choose their gender, because you believe in the scientific and binary realities of science with regard to gender …and therefore want public bathrooms and locker rooms to be used accordingly.  
I could go on and on.  Liberal politics and ideology has become so extreme, and out of touch with reality, science, and much of America.  In short, liberal politics is antithetical to the judeo-Christian values on which Western civilization is founded… values that even mainstream secular and non-religious people usually accept.  There is nothing hateful about resisting the extreme and perverse indoctrination sweeping our college campuses today.
Very well stated Benjamin.
Don’t disrupt any speaker’s event on campus.  Others have the right to listen.  Don’t like the speaker?  Don’t attend.  Simply…..really.
Hate speech? Calls for violence? Calls for unfair discrimination against people by race, religion, gender choice, physical appearance? Of course those do not belong at USC. The problem comes when students or administrations will not allow those to speak who are conservative. Am I conservative? No! But I am sickened when free speech and discussion is forbidden on that basis alone. THAT kind of narrow-minded, unthinking, orthodox, unfair discrimination does not belong at USC, either.
This opinion piece was written by the mind of a teenager who may have been educated in the UE, under 50 years of liberalism.  You poor chilr.  Your mind has been twisted into thinking that fascism and liberalism is good for the country.   It is not. Your liberal views are t he by product of years of indoctrination into the world of liberal Democratic priciples, which history has proven don’t work.  
And you call your president incompetent?  He has accomplished more in his early days than most presidents, despite the obstructionist attacks of Sen. Chuck Schumer and even the RHINOS in the GOP.  Trump was elected by an overwhelming landslide victory because we have had enough of the destructive, manipulative policies of the L I beryl political leadership over the past 8 years, and even the craziness of Bush and Clinton.  
We have taken back our country and we are moving forward to bring back economic freedom and global respect.  Come along with or not, in the end your life m will prosper and be better for it.
Additiinally, illegally entering this country is a felony no matter how hard the liberal establishment tries to change the meaning and effect, you are an illegal alien, a trespasser and must be death with according to the laws of the land.  Even our fearless leader Obama stated that same thought, though he wasn’t effective at carrying it out.  You see, Democrats want illegals to gain citizenship so that they, like the black and Hispanic community ities, will be beholden to the Dems for handouts, entitlements, thus their vote.  You see, the Dems are not a benevolent group.  They don’t want citizens and legal immigrants to have a job and work for a living, to have their own money, their own power to live their oives. Dems want to own you through the ever tightening noose of power and control over you, the way you live, learn, think and say via handouts, freebies.  They don’t want to teach you to fish. They will give the fish to you, but you will always pay the price.
So be  are fully what you wish for, for the unintended circumstances will not be pleasant.
“Trump was elected by an overwhelming landslide victory” I’m assuming you mean the electoral college. Sir, you do realize that Trump did not win the popular vote, correct?
I will only address one component of your comment here, and that is that women in society can’t have it both ways.  They can’t demand “equality” while also wanting to be treated differently or specially.  Female writers on this or any forum are subject to the same scrutiny and criticism as any other writer.
Mitch, thank you for reading my posts and commenting.  This is what the 1st Amendment is all about.  You don’t agree with my comments, but that’s cool, young man. Everyone has an opinion and I choose to state mine here when I think it is necessary.
As far as your attack against me for commenting of only the female posts, that’s a good observation.  Again, you’re reading and learning.  I am special in your life this afternoon and own some space in your memory.
For the most part, guys write about sports. the female contributors, lately, have been pushing ideologies that are contrary to our values.  The Womens March was not about women. it was about pushing a man hating, leftist ideology that excludes at least 2 groups of women.. Conservative women were not allowed to march with the other females, and the pro-choice movement , which was the most pursed story line of those marches excludes all female babies that were murdered by their mothers. Does that make the mothers actually hosts that killed their somewhat symbiotic life form aka their offspring?  Their baby? Their child?
 And yes, you are children, kids, late teenagers who have yet to work and live in the real world… so yes, I do take my many years of experience to heart. You do not know me, nor where I came from, nor my experiences, so try if you can, to be respectful of your elders, as we know a lot more than you, we have lived through the good times and the bad times, we have fought wars for your freedom.  And many have given the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to protect that freedom.  So yes….   and we have forgotten much more than you’ll learn.  Again, thank you for taking the time to read my post and comment.  I love the dialog and will look forward ot more as the semester continues……..   However, with that said, I can’t wait for football season.  It’s gonna be a great year.  Fight On…..

Meditation: It’s one of those things that you probably should be doing, but definitely aren’t, like eating five fruits a day or not looking at artificial light before bed. But considering the health benefits according to studies, like reducing anxiety, insomnia and making more folds in your brain which helps transmit signals faster, there’s no reason not to. And as a certified person with literally no chill, it’s been my goal to meditate at least a few times a week. My mom even bought me a real-life CD with guided practice on it.
It’s recommended to meditate right before bed, but that doesn’t always work, especially if you’re a stressed student like me, and just fall asleep if you lay down past 10 p.m. So I’ve gathered up some places to meditate on campus! All you need is a quiet place, some headphones, a guided practice (many free one can be found online) or mantra, and at least 15 or 20 minutes. 

Grassy Knolls
I say this in a general sense because there are a few great Grassy Knolls or Hills on campus. The one to the east of the old Annenberg building (behind Taper) is a favorite of mine. 
It can get a little chatty at lunch time, but if you have headphones it’s no big deal. Other campus knolls include in the music school if you don’t mind acoustic guitar, and the big hill on the side of McCarthy Quad (not recommended on Wednesday during the Farmer’s Market). These are great if it’s sunny and not great if it’s rainy or cold, and the soft grass is great if you want to take a post-meditation nap.

Stretch of Grass behind Bridge/Hoffman
It may be close to the road, but that means traffic will drown out any conversations that make take you from your zone. There’s some cool statues to hang near — and as far as grassy spots on campus go, this one is pretty quiet and sunny, with most students only really walking by. The place is good for a quick 15 minute session.

Honestly, The Library
OK, hear me out on this one. It’s quiet (especially when you go up to the third or fourth floor of Leavey) and no one will judge you if you put your head down and close your eyes. The chairs may not be the most comfortable, but doesn’t the just keep you mindful of your body? And chances are, since it’s midterm season, you’re already in the library, so you might as well get some relaxation and focus on your study break instead of refreshing instagram again. Or do both. Good for a study break!
The guided meditation albums can get pretty expensive, but there are so many more resources (like the entire Internet) out there to create the program that is perfect for you. Some mantras work better on other people than they may for you. Just remember, you’re giving back to your body just by trying to meditate. And your body will love you for that. Soon enough you will be zen.

For anyone who knows me, who, let’s be honest, is probably everyone actually reading this, you know that sports are a huge part of my life. In fact, sports have become such a fundamental part of who I am that I’m pursuing a career in sports — go figure. Anyways, New Zealand isn’t always thought of as a sporting mecca of the world, but I was very excited to experience my first international sporting event at a professional rugby game last weekend.
Coming with the excitement and expectation of a typical USC football game, I was a little taken aback by the seemingly relaxed nature of the stadium at first. There wasn’t the typical fanfare from the stadium that we are used to in American arenas. There was no hype tape, no dance cam, no celebrity endorsements of the team.
The fan experience was definitely different than any game I have attended at home. It reminded me of the experiment the New York Knicks undertook just a couple weeks ago where they nixed all the music, video and in-game entertainment that accompanies a sporting event. I would argue that it allows the fans to experience the game in a more pure form and there are no distractions.
Everyone in the stadium is solely focused on the game. There aren’t training wheels for those who don’t normally watch sports. I think without all that distraction it actually breeds fans who are more into and focused on the game though not as boisterous as American fans.
This isn’t to say that the arena had no energy. Whenever something happened, good or bad to the Blues (Auckland’s home team), the crowd would erupt. When the Blues scored, plumes of fire shot into the sky from the sidelines.
I felt more in my element inside the park than I had for a long time when doing something for the first time. I was so happy that my experience cemented something in my mind that I have believed for a long time. It’s never just about what happened on the field in any given game, but it’s about bringing people together. 
There was a large group of American students who attended with our local study abroad adviser and one guy was excited to start the wave. Our adviser assured him that though it isn’t a normal staple at a rugby game, everyone would know what to do. He was right. Our American started the wave and it went around the stadium for a complete two cycles — something I’ve never been a part of at home. It always peters out halfway around.
This experience helped me see another side of studying abroad. This experience isn’t just about me learning about Kiwi culture, but it’s also about me bringing my American culture to another country. The exchange of culture can come anywhere — as demonstrated by this rugby game — but the location doesn’t matter as much as ensuring that it is a positive for both parties.
Combining studying abroad and my love for sports has been a highlight of mine so far, but more so for what I learned about both New Zealand and American culture along the way than for what happened on the field. With all that said, unfortunately the Blues lost. As time expired, they failed to score a try though they had been knocking on the door. So given all the existential stuff that I took away from the game, know that I still did enjoy everything that went on in the game and was on my feet cheering as time expired along with everyone else in the stadium, American or Kiwi.
Kia ora, Hailey.
Interesting to see Auckland through foreign eyes, I think I’ll keep a lookout for your further posts.
Cheers.

Dolores Huerta, an activist for civic engagement and labor, LGBTQ and immigrant rights and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, held a discussion panel concerning activism and organization at Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday.
During the panel, Huerta discussed her career as an activist and what helping others meant to her. Huerta has received several honors, including nine honorary doctorates, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights.
 Huerta spoke of the changing U.S. political climate and pushed for discontent people not to lose hope, but instead to unite and advocate for the causes they care about. 
“Don’t mourn, organize,” Huerta said. “Organizing does work.”
Huerta’s foundation often takes a grassroots approach to organizing. She said that by forming groups of people galvanized by like-minded efforts, more people would come forth to advocate.
“We have people elected to office who don’t believe [in climate change], that it’s a hoax, that it’s not true, so we have to make sure that we are able to get our voices heard,” Huerta said. “We have to let these people know that they are making the laws we care about.”
Currently, Huerta and the rest of the foundation are promoting Proposition SB 54, which would make California a sanctuary state. Huerta encouraged the audience to support the proposition and show compassion to undocumented immigrants. 
Huerta also advocated for Proposition 47, a criminal justice initiative proposed to reduce classification of most nonviolent property and drug crimes from a felony to a misdemeanor. 
“She gave not just a lot of inspiration, but concrete ideas of how students and community members can make a difference,” said Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano. 
Andra Astorga, a freshman majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, ,shared Vela’s sentiment. 
“I definitely feel like it’s not as hard as we make it seem to actually get involved in the community and make a difference,” Astorga said. 
Huerta emphasized the importance of working together to create a difference.
 “I know sometimes it feels a little helpless, but I have to tell you that in my own experience, and I’ve been an organizer since I was 25 years old, that organizing does work,” Huerta said. 
Vela also said that he hopes to invite more activists onto campus in the future. He also said that El Centro Chicano plans to host a film screening of Dolores, a movie set to release next fall about Huerta’s life. 
“It’s a great opportunity to partner with more folks and faculty and students so we can bring even more folks to hear her message, in particular students who have a different perspective on politics,” Vela said. “There’s so much work that needs to be done across the aisle.”

Interesting that you and your generation admire anarchists like Hierta, who advocates breaking federal laws just because you don’t like them. That is one of many issues that is wrong with people like her and her followers.  At least there weren’t any riots or vandalism caused by moderates and conservatives when someone with an opposing view comes on campus and speaks, unlike what happned at Berkeley.  
And yes the political climate has changed. Liberals and anarchists have run this country for 50 years and what do we have? A broken society. A society that believes that it n is acceptable behavior to break laws, harbor illegal aliens trespassing our borders, social and moral values that are denigrating to womn, the man hating NOW.  And  now, according to a news report I heard last night, maps of the world are going to be changed to not show the true sizes of countries in relation tomscale.  North America and Europe are to look smaller in size compared to other countries even though the new scale is incorrect, just becausee some people are insulted that their country is small.  Sounds like penis envy. Geez.
Huerta may have a presidential medal of freedom encased on a wall in her h I use, but think ab I UT why she r e cried it.  There are some 5 hints she’s accomplished for the better well being of poor and disadvantaged people, but her anarchist views are contrary to American values and laws.  Why do folks idolize an anarchist?

Undergraduate Student Government President Edwin Saucedo delivered his State of USG address at the USG Senate meeting on Tuesday, highlighting the projects that USG has undertaken and its accomplishments this year.
He began his address by revisiting the goals his administration set for the 2016-2017 school year. Among these were improving campus sustainability, improving college affordability and mental health support and advocacy. He also had aimed to give a voice to USC’s first generation and low-income students and improve the accessibility of USG. 
“Our efforts to create a better USG and USC really began with transforming our organization internally,” Saucedo said. 
Previously, USG was divided into the Executive Cabinet and Program Board. This past year, Saucedo and his administration decided to differentiate USG’s branches and their respective roles by creating six different branches: Program Board, Communications, Advocacy, Legislative, Funding and Judicial. 
“This switch helped us consolidate resources and positions within the organization and ensured that an executive member was directly supporting each group,” Saucedo said. 
Saucedo went on to highlight USG’s increased allocation of funds for student programs and the mobilization of a 120-member team to represent the various communities and identities on campus, such as transfer students, spring admits, students with disabilities and campus sustainability initiatives. 
“These advisers have not only been able to work on their own advocacy projects, but also serve as a resource and collaborating partners to others in our organization,” Saucedo said. “An example of this collaboration will be displayed at Springfest, where for the first time ever, we will have wheelchair-accessible viewing platforms so that all students will be able to enjoy their experience and have a clear view of the show.” 
According to Saucedo, USG also increased the pool of funding resources for other student organizations this year, setting aside over $350,000 dollars in funds. This was a $50,000 increase from last year. 
He also highlighted the achievements of USG’s Senate, which created resolutions aimed to improve the student experience. Some examples include passing the Smoke-Free Campus Resolution and voting to make USC a sanctuary campus.
On the topic of advocacy, Saucedo said there were both successes and obstacles. USG eliminated the additional fees that were required on top of tuition, such as lab fees. 
Additionally, for the first time, USC’s administration released an infographic this year that explained how tuition dollars were being used. However, he acknowledged that USC tuition still increased by 4 percent this year, a rate that has been continuous since 2015. 
In his closing statements, Saucedo said USG has submitted its proposal for a center for first-generation and low-income students, which would provide advising, community space and strategic programs. According to Saucedo, USG has also been actively exploring how to decrease students’ financial barriers to getting involved without affecting their financial aid. 
“These are only some of the highlights of the work we have been able to accomplish over the last year,” Saucedo said. “I cannot express enough how grateful I am to each and every one of my executives and team members for making this possible. Throughout my term in USG, I have been surrounded by individuals who passionately fight for underrepresented student voices, and work extensively to create the best undergraduate experience for all students.”

When L.A. Metro Chief Planning Officer Therese McMillan flew to Los Angeles to begin her job, she was struck by the responsibility of helping almost 10 million people use public transportation.
Her job held such high importance to her that she presented “Juggling Crystal Balls: Tackling LA County’s Transportation Future” Tuesday night at the Price School of Public Policy’s METRANS Transportation Center. McMillan also spoke about the challenges of planning transportation in a time when she said new technology is frequent and disruptive.
“Uber and Lyft have forced us to ask the question: What does public transportation really mean?” McMillan said. “No one knows what will happen in 40 years.”
McMillan also emphasized the importance of closing the opportunity gap for L.A. citizens.
“The customer has to be the foundation of any good planning process,” McMillan said. “It’s not the infrastructure, not the money, but the people we serve.”
Yurida Ramos, a graduate student in the Master of Planning program, works with METRANS and helped organize the event in conjunction with Victoria Deguzman, the Associate Director of Administration for METRANS. Deguzman stressed the importance of public entities in Los Angeles.
“I really enjoy working for a public agency because I like the idea that we are reaching all of our constituents,” Ramos said. “I want to make sure all of our programs are equitable.”
Ramos said she was impressed with McMillan’s view of a nebulous future for public transportation.
“I liked the long range transportation plan model that she has,” Ramos said. “She spoke a lot of truth when she said a lot of people plan for the future when we don’t have all the numbers.”
Fahad Manzur, a senior majoring in economics, said he came to the event because of the links he sees between public transportation, urban development and economic decisions.
“I plan on living in Los Angeles, and I do have troubles with transportation here,” Manzur said. “I think that [McMillan] understands there is a lot of restructuring that needs to happen, and she’s working hard to organize the system.”
Eric Tunell, a graduate student in the Master of Planning program, considered access to public transportation when choosing where to live.
“I prefer to take the train when I can to avoid traffic,” Tunell said. “I’m really happy that Los Angeles seems to be committed to expanding these types of options.”
Tunell also works with METRANS and said he was excited to hear about the new plans for more equitable and community-based transportation.
 “[McMillan] thinks in a very comprehensive way about the challenges that Los Angeles faces,” Tunell said. “It’s always exciting to hear a practitioner talk about the real-world applications of what we’re learning in class.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that “Juggling Crystal Balls: Tackling LA County’s Transportation Future” was the name of McMillan’s book. It was actually the name of the event. The article also stated Victoria Deguzman was the Assistant Director of Administration for METRANS. She is the associate director. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.
