If anyone knows best about the fashion world, it’s Bill Cunningham. And if you don’t know who that is, you’ve seriously been missing out. 
Bill Cunningham is an 85-year-old fashion photographer who roams the sidewalks of New York City, capturing life through the street style of ordinary people. In his trademark blue coat, Bill has used his lens to mold the perception of fashion into something that is more than just labels and price tags. 
The Harvard dropout is a simple and humble gentleman who is unfazed by wealth or status, and unbelievably passionate about his work. Every Sunday he compiles a collage of his photographs for the New York Times where he highlights trends and popular styles of the week, focusing on how people take a trend and make it their own. 
For those who don’t receive the paper, his finds are recapped in short video clips on the New York Times website, and the excitement in his voice when talking about these styles might be the cutest thing you’ll hear all week. Bill has spent many years informing us with his favorite snaps of influential style, doing so in a way that only suggests his interpretation while allowing others to experience it for themselves. 
Bill Cunningham embodies everything that I love about fashion. He speaks his mind regardless of popular opinions, forges his own path and offers an honest depiction of how the everyday people of New York take fashion into their own hands. While he may wear the same blue jacket everyday, his excitement for the individuality of others and love for fashion and style is contagious. He’s loyal to his love for fashion and determined to share it with others. For this, Bill Cunningham is a model of the purest and most genuine outlook on the modern world of fashion, and an inspiration for us all.
A link to his inspiring and influential documentary, Bill Cunningham New York, can be found here and is also available on iTunes and Netflix.
And of course, the link to his video feed for the New York Times.
So, if you’re looking for a mid-week sartorial inspiration, Bill is the place to turn. 
“The wider world has perceived fashion as frivolity that should be done away with. The point is that fashion is the armor to survive everyday life,” Cunningham said. “I don’t think you can do away with it. It would be like doing away with civilization.”

Roommates can make or break your year
When transitioning into college, be open to getting to know your roommates. They can become your closest friends in the years to come. On the flip side, do not be afraid to change roommates if you are unhappy with your living situation.
Winter blues in semester two
Though first semester is a challenging time for transition, second semester can be just as difficult. As the novelty and excitement of your first semester dies down, second semester can catch you as surprisingly difficult. Seek out support when you are missing home or overwhelmed by new challenges.
Nothing is for certain
It is common to enter college thinking you know what you want, only to realize it has changed. If you realize this, be open to the idea of changing your future plans. Look to your academic advisors and professors for guidance if you’re thinking about changing your major or switching classes.
Transferring is normal
It is normal to change your plan along the way. If you are unhappy with your school, do not be afraid to change universities. For example, USC welcomes hundreds of transfer students each year.
Study time, but the livin’ ain’t easy
Allotting time for studying is crucial, even if it is just a GE. Regardless of the course, you are paying to be at school and, therefore, you might as well apply yourself.
C’s do get degrees
Though studying is important, getting a bad grade is not the end of the world. Maintaining a balance of working hard and enjoying yourself can be beneficial. Balancing the two can be done, but remember to sleep!
Never fear the professor
Professors have office hours to help you, as well as to get to know you. If you’re at a competitive university like USC, hopefully your professors will have worked extensively in their field. Therefore, they can be helpful in helping to plan your future plans, whether it’s advice about what classes to take or helping you secure an internship or job.
The Freshman 15 does exist
This is most likely the first time you are living on a budget and away from your parents, both of which can impact your eating habits. Eating healthy and exercising can benefit you more than you know. 
Find your own “family”
You can find your community in various places on campus, whether it’s greek life, a sports team or a club. These connections can last a lifetime. There are 43,000 students at USC; the odds are in your favor to find at least one good friend.
Time flies when you’re having fun
You only go to college for a limited time so take advantage of being a Trojan. These years are not only some of the greatest, but also prepare you for the many experiences to come.

“Whoa, it’s like two tornados and a hurricane blew through here,” teases our RA as he catches sight of Kayla’s room. The six of us laugh guiltily before continuing to pass shoes and jewelry back and forth to the beat of Taylor Swift’s Blank Space. After almost an hour of perfecting winged eyeliner and trying on at least three outfits each, we are dressed to kill. We rush down the elevator, our excitement causing our voices to come out at least two octaves higher than usual, and jump into the uÜber. The driver grins at us and winks conspiratorially, “Where to, ladies?” 
After dinner and a few hours of exploring Downtown L.A., we find ourselves sitting at an outdoor table with our Sprinkles to-go bags spread out in front of us. Kayla pulls out her cupcake and I laugh. It’s an absolute disaster, and half the frosting has fallen off the side. She just giggles and pops a piece into her mouth mischievously. 
“Don’t eat it yet!” we scold in unison, and Kayla puts the cupcake down dramatically. “Okay but hurry up and sing to me already, I can’t not have this in my stomach any longer!” she complains. After a very off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday,” Kayla blows out her imaginary candle and we toast to 18 by attacking our desserts with such a passion that an elderly couple looks on with raised eyebrows.
When we finally pile back into the car, our cheeks sore from laughing, I kick off my heels and look around. Nicki’s trying to teach Raisa how to french braid, Sampreeti and Kayla are harmonizing in the back seat, and Bei’s chatting animatedly with the driver. As I lean my head against the cool window, I realize that these girls are what make college so incredible. I marvel at the fact that if I hadn’t gotten up the nerve to talk to them, with their intimidating confidence and wide smiles, I wouldn’t be half as happy as I am tonight.
College is about the people we meet, the things they teach us, and the way they make us feel. Although the sheer number of strangers can feel overwhelming at times, take a deep breath and introduce yourself. You’ll be surprised at how much easier things get after that. Pretty soon you’ll find your own family within the larger USC community. Two months ago I was too shy to get to know any of these girls, and now I realize how much I was missing out on.

Come Nov. 1, students will be recovering from the Weekender or Halloweekend festivities, but they will also experience the wonders of having one extra hour in the night due to Daylight Saving Time ending. While initially this opportunity to sleep for an extra hour may seem too good to be true, students should heed the dangers of staying up later to supposedly take advantage of the time change.
Daylight Saving Time was originally created to make use of extra sunlight hours and cut down on energy costs. However, Daylight Saving Time does not make much of an impact on sleep-wake cycles. Staying up an hour later could simply make waking up Sunday morning that much more difficult because of ill-adjusted sleep cycles. If you are happy waking up an hour earlier than ordinary and going to sleep an hour earlier, then this could be the perfect excuse to adjust your sleep schedule.
Otherwise, going to sleep and waking up 10 to 15 minutes later each day this week before the time changes might be an easier way to adjust.
This circadian rhythm shock certainly represents an additional stressor in college students’ lives. Research in the Nature of Science of Sleep has cited that majority of students experience daytime sleepiness, sleep deprivation and irregular sleep schedules. These factors can contribute to overarching problems on college campuses including difficulty focusing on academics and changes in mood.
Sleep experts typically recommend at least seven hours of sleep per night in order to prevent sleep deprivation, while eight hours of sleep per night allows for ideal functioning. The consumption of caffeine after lunch hours, use of technology (directly related to light exposure), stimulating activity (such as exercising) later in the day, and undiagnosed sleep disorders are cited as primary causes for daytime sleepiness. Sleep experts also say that going to sleep later at night, and waking up later in the morning are typically associated with lower GPAs.
While there is no perfect cure to these chronic sleep issues on college campuses, certain steps can certainly be taken to combat the effects of sleep deprivation. Napping during the day, exercising in the morning rather than night, creating a structured sleep and study schedule, and minimizing use of technology, caffeine, drugs or alcohol before bed can all help to reduce sleep deprivation and its negative effects. Being conscious of your sleep schedule and prioritizing sleep as a vital part of your daily schedule can vastly improve daily function and performance.
As Benjamin Franklin said, “Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,” and let’s be real, Trojans, should we not aspire to some of those things? That pre-bed Facebook scroll ritual might seem like a great idea, but some more sleep sounds like one too.
Fight on, sleep early, and don’t forget to set your clocks back!
Daylight saving time benefits no one…it’s a relic from 1907.  Do people really need an extra hour of daylight to watch television or surf the web?
Lower GPAs! Less Happy! More Grumpy, Droopy and Flabby! Less Peaceful and Now Students Much Sicker and Possibly Dead Sometimes! Megha Gupta seems to be following in the footsteps of Don Quixote who lost his wits after too much reading. Gupta maybe wrote down too many words for this clock change assignment.

Due to Los Angeles’s lack of cold weather, the beach is a common year-round destination for many visitors. It’s perfect for tanning, playing volleyball, people watching and walking around the shops to name a few activities. The diversity of L.A.’s beaches makes it easy for people to choose according to their personal preferences. Below is a detailed list that describes the type of beaches around the L.A. area:
Venice Beach
Located in between Santa Monica and Marina Del Rey, Venice Beach is ideal for visitors who want to relax and do activities other than actually going to the beach. Abbot Kinney Boulevard features many local vendors, tasty treats and street artists that come out and perform in front of crowds. There are also a lot of cozy cafés and restaurants behind the beachfront on Pacific Avenue. Venice Beach is home to many young, zany people and hipsters that wander around the walkway.
Manhattan Beach
If you’re looking for a more refined scenery, then Manhattan Beach is the beach for you. It is just five minutes west of LAX, surrounded by upscale beach houses that overlook the Pacific Ocean. This beach makes jogging long distances more enjoyable, as there are paved trails that run along the sand. It’s a favorite destination for athletic people who go to Manhattan Beach for their daily exercise.
Huntington Beach
Host of the U.S. Open of Surfing held every summer, Huntington Beach is home to many surfers and people that enjoy the warm waters and giant waves. There are many surf shops and seafood restaurants nearby. The close proximity to the Long Beach port makes Huntington Beach a perfect place for all kinds of water activities. This beach is a popular spot for families with children and groups of friends, as the beach setting is more traditional than the other beaches.  
Malibu
Once you follow the Pacific Coast Highway up from Santa Monica, you’ll eventually hit Malibu, which offers a picturesque coastline with dramatic cliffs overlooking the ocean. Malibu is more secluded in comparison to other beaches, and this beach is ideal for lounging and tanning. The area also has a lot of hiking trails of all difficulty levels and tide pools on the shores. Many people who go to Malibu are often younger adult couples and older families.
Los Angeles provides a variety of beaches that you can pick from. The right one is out there, waiting for you.

USC athletic director Pat Haden is stepping down from the College Football Playoff selection committee, Executive Director Bill Hancock announced today.
“I am reluctant to step down, but my doctors advised me to reduce my traveling,” Haden said.
The 62-year-old Haden has most recently been dealing with some health concerns. He felt ill on the sidelines prior to USC’s game two weeks ago at Notre Dame and was later taken to a local hospital before checking out and heading back to Los Angeles early on a private plane.
The 2015 season marked the second year of a two-year term that Haden was serving on the committee, which will have 12 members, as opposed to 13, for the rest of the season.
“It was an honor to serve on the College Football Playoff Selection Committee,” Haden said. “I have such high regard for the CFP process and for the committee members, who devote such time and energy to the great sport of college football.”
The committee will release its first rankings this Tuesday, November 3 and will issue its weekly rankings up until Selection Day on Sunday, December 6. As a member of the committee, Haden would have begun making weekly trips to Dallas, Texas, in order to deliberate alongside his fellow committee members.
“With the weekly CFP meetings about to start and the travel commitment involved, I had to make this difficult decision,” Haden said. “I feel it is in the best interest of the CFP and also of USC, with our current football coaching change and our upcoming Coliseum renovation.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan earlier this season, Haden said that his role on the committee was to focus primarily on the Atlantic Coast Conference, along with University of Wisconsin Athletic Director Barry Alvarez.
“We will miss Pat,” Hancock said. “He knows and loves college football and brought excellent insight to the process, but we all understand.”
Haden terminated former USC head coach Steve Sarkisian earlier this month and had been under an increased amount of fire after details of Sarkisian’s history with alcohol surfaced.
After naming Clay Helton the team’s interim head coach, Haden continues his search for the program’s next head coach.

Grocery store shelves become stocked with more and more pumpkin-themed and flavored goodies each year: peanut butter, English muffins, marshmallows, chocolate — the list goes on.

From Black Friday to Christmas Day itself, it is impossible to turn on the radio and not be bombarded by the incalculable renditions of Jingle Bell Rock or Mariah Carey belting about what she wants for Christmas.  I think it’s fair to assume the holiday most Americans associate with music is Christmas. However, there’s one other holiday that definitely deserves its own soundtrack. I’m talking about Halloween.
To quote Halloweentown’s Marnie Piper, “Halloween is cool.” I love Halloween especially now that I’m older.  As much as I loved trick-or-treating, I feel empowered buying my own candy and much prefer going to costume parties than running around cul-de-sacs begging for Butterfingers all evening. However, nothing is more tragic than when you get to a party and the hosts clearly don’t know what they’re doing with the aux cord and sound system.  As much as I love Thriller (and yes, spoiler, it is included in the playlist I have made), playing obvious choices on a constant loop doesn’t give Halloween the respect it deserves. So, to help you get started with your own party playlists, I’ve thrown together a list of songs that I believe covers all the loveable clichés (i.e. “Monster Mash”) while doing the holiday some justice.
