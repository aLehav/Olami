We’ve all heard the story before: A mentally unstable man armed with an assault weapon walks into a public establishment and murders dozens in a catastrophic frenzy. Posts about the horrific incident go viral on social media. Parents, siblings, friends of victims — oftentimes in tears — are interviewed on broadcast news, desperately begging lawmakers to make some kind of change in gun control policy. Politicians issue thoughts and prayers. Sometimes a bill restricting gun access is introduced, but rarely does it ever pass. The story drops out of the news cycle within a couple of weeks.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
It’s a shame that when disaster struck Parkland, Fla., last week, I wasn’t surprised. Horrified and heartbroken, sure, but not surprised. That feeling passed a few years ago after I ran through a crowd of shoppers in a Newport Beach mall because there was a drive-by shooting in the parking lot. And then again during my junior year of high school, after I participated in a lockdown because of an alleged shooter on campus. And then again during my senior year, after a few of my classmates were accused of planning a mass shooting. And then again during my fall 2017 semester at USC, after I participated in yet another lockdown because of another alleged shooter on the loose. Save the mall incident, all cases turned out to be false alarms. But the feelings of pure terror and helplessness? All too real.
My generation has grown up in a time when lockdown drills are as routine as fire drills. Sometimes after a mass shooting would make the news, my friends and I would imagine heroic scenarios in which we thwart a shooter who came into our class — while simultaneously hoping that such an instance would never happen to us. It goes without saying that the fearful concept of gun violence has permeated the mindset of American teens as we attempt to navigate a scary, violent world. The brave, well-spoken students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are products of this society. They stand at the forefront of national discourse surrounding gun violence as they represent a new generation of student-led activism formed by years of fear and frustration that stems largely from the apathy of lawmakers who may never understand how we really feel.
As a member of this new generation of activism, I’m well-acquainted with the controversial influence of the National Rifle Association, the debates over increased school security and the ridiculous notion of arming teachers with guns. And while these are all important discussions to have, there is one question that never escapes my mind, one that addresses another issue: What forms the twisted mindset of a mass shooter?
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Perhaps some of the blame can be placed on the cruelty of a society that rejects outsiders. Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with the Parkland shooting, fits the generic description of the “lone wolf” shooters we’ve become all-too-accustomed to: depressed, paranoid and resentful. Students at Stoneman Douglas — from which Cruz was expelled when he was a junior — used to joke that if anyone were to initiate a shooting at the school, it would be him. Eventually, Cruz became exactly what his peers decided to label him.
Reflecting on Cruz’s troubling past, The New York Times published an article entitled “The Boys Are Not Alright,” which addressed the glaring fact that most — if not all —  school shooters are male. Boys and men are trapped by outdated notions of masculinity; they have difficulty expressing emotional struggles they may have because, unfortunately, such acts are viewed as feminine and shameful. As the article points out, to escape their emotional struggles as boys, men like Cruz have two options at this point: “withdrawal or rage.” Cruz chose rage.
And so the question becomes: How do we fix boys like Cruz?
For one, people can start by showing a bit more compassion to those around them. As mentioned before, Cruz was ostracized by his peers at school. He was the outsider — a “sicko,” as President Donald Trump so eloquently tweeted — and his label as the “future school shooter” only worsened his dark thoughts.
But, of course, a simple smile in the halls or a superficial “how are you” are not nearly enough to make a shooter put down his gun. At home, some of the obligation should be placed on families to nip these problems in the bud. James and Kimberly Snead, the couple who took Cruz in after his mother died, stated that they had no knowledge of Cruz’s dark intentions. Although the Sneads knew of Cruz’s mental health issues, they still let him keep his guns at home. Even after concerning outbursts — such as the time Cruz released a Snapchat video in which he cut himself and said he wanted to buy a gun — he was never hospitalized.
Furthermore, as centers for both academic and personal development, schools can do their part in establishing emotional literacy among their students. After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence developed a program called RULER, which prioritizes the growth of social skills among young, impressionable students. One could argue that if Cruz had received these mental health services early on, he never would have resorted to such violence.
But that’s all just speculation. I’m going to pause here to make an important point: By no means am I advocating the position that “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” In regard to putting an end to the immediate issue, America is in desperate need of some change in gun control policy. While we can debate that he could have been helped if only people were more emotionally perceptive, nobody would have died in Parkland if Cruz didn’t have such easy access to an AR-15 — that much is for sure.
While it’s not enough to end all mass shootings, the prioritization of mental health both at home and in schools is a step in the right direction. We cannot normalize “outsider” culture any longer. No matter how troubled an individual may seem, nobody is truly a lost cause.
And so, after all of this grief, anxiety, fear, anger — the list of emotions goes on — I wonder: Where is the love? Right now, I’m afraid that love is lost, along with the lives of 17 students and teachers in Parkland, Fla.

My father-in-law was “woke” before it was cool to be woke. As a college student in the 1960s, he was heavily involved in the marches, protests and rallies that — at the time — called for equity and empowerment of the Mexican American community. In this neighborhood, one of the end goals of the Chicanx Movement was the creation of a student center meant to serve the needs of the University’s Chicanx population.
Mr. Rodriguez is no longer with us, though upon reading the article in the Feb. 13 issue of the Daily Trojan, I would venture to say that he would be the first to offer his voice in support of a more inclusive name for El Centro Chicano. Mr. Rodriguez would have argued, and some of his contemporaries would agree, that the Chicanx people of his day used their voices to benefit those who did not have voices of their own.
Here at USC, students learn about the inequality, inequity and discrimination that exists not only between, but also within members of different racial and ethnic groups. We learn — particularly in the Latinx community — that lighter skin is “better” than darker skin, and that your narrative is less valuable the farther your origins are from Mexico. 
Mr. Rodriguez would have advocated against this notion that somehow the views and needs of one group of Latinx people are somehow more important than those of another. He would have argued that as Chicanx people, it was their responsibility to pull others up and not to push them down.
In recent months, as this country has seen an increase in hate and discrimination against certain groups, we have also learned that if we are to achieve change and make progress, the battles fought by one group cannot be theirs alone. When women march for equality, men must march with them. When immigrants protest callous immigration policies, citizens must be there to protest alongside them. 
It’s difficult for me to believe that the individuals responsible for bringing the dream of El Centro to the grounds of this University would not recognize the need for inclusivity. I know about the politics of names and labels, but I doubt the Mexican American students who founded El Centro would tell their sisters and brothers from El Salvador or Honduras or Guatemala to get their own center.
The Latino Alumni Association long ago recognized the fault in creating the perception that their doors were open only to Mexican American alumni. In changing its name, the Latino Alumni Association managed to include the entire Latinx community while still honoring the legacy of the Mexican Americans who founded it. In 2018, when society recognizes that unity and inclusivity matter more than ever, it’s time for El Centro to recognize this as well.

Kenan Draughorne | Daily Trojan
It’s fitting that the concept of Afrofuturism had such a moment this Black History Month, allowing us to honor black tradition while also focusing on the road ahead, in more ways than one. Marvel’s transformative Black Panther movie as well as the accompanying album produced by Kendrick Lamar deservedly dominated much of the conversation, but for many who saw the film in theaters, the feature wasn’t the only brilliant Afrofuturist creation on display, thanks to singer and actress Janelle Monáe and the trailer for her upcoming album Dirty Computer.
When the album drops in April, it will have been nearly five years since the talented singer released the critically acclaimed The Electric Lady in 2013, the fourth and fifth installments of her extensive Metropolis concept. She’s been the furthest thing from a recluse in that lengthy time span, however, starring in the groundbreaking film Hidden Figures and impressing as a supporting actress in 2017 Best Picture winner Moonlight. But it’s her music that’s distinguished her as an exceptional creative far ahead of her time, and the reason her next release should spark heavy anticipation in the coming months.
Monáe launched the (as of now) seven-act saga in 2007, with her debut EP “Metropolis: The Chase Suite.” The EP was the genesis story of Monáe’s android alter-ego Cindi Mayweather, sentenced to disassembly after breaking her robot community’s golden rule by falling in love with a human. While fleeing captivity, she discovers that she is the prophesized savior tasked with freeing the androids from human dominion and uniting the two races, and struggles over the decision on her debut album The ArchAndroid before finally returning home to lead the revolution in The Electric Lady.
Like far too many other music fans, my knowledge of Monáe’s catalogue has been mostly limited to scattered songs that were playlist favorites, but lacked context within the larger narrative. The first time I heard her music wasn’t even by conscious choice; rather, it had been a byproduct of my middle school obsession with NBA Live `09, the soundtrack to which included the funky “Violet Stars Happy Hunting!” off her debut EP. As future studio albums trickled into the ecosphere, select singles would somehow nudge their way into my library: The Big Boi-assisted “Tightrope” floored me with outstanding percussion that hit harder than that of an HBCU drumline, and “Primetime” featuring Miguel would soundtrack many late-night smoke sessions freshman year and beyond.
 As irresistible as songs like these became, out of neglect, laziness or simple forgetfulness, I never managed to fully dive into Monáe’s android-filled universe of Metropolis. That oversight was finally corrected this February, first out of a long-stifled interest in her narrative, then out of an urgent compulsion to be on track with her story in time for Dirty Computer’s arrival.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Long before blending musical styles became the norm in recent years, Monáe’s albums were transcending traditional boundaries, seamlessly and effortlessly. Attempting to categorize the nearly three-hour journey into a single genre or even art form is remarkably futile; the trilogy is reminiscent of a libretto to an adventure-packed theater musical, highlighted with cinematic elements that build the project into an immense scope.
 Rather than mold the albums around a specific sound, Monáe prioritizes the story above all else, and taps into whatever style is best suited to make each plot point resonate with her listeners. The direr Cindi’s circumstances, the faster the drum beats to accordingly raise the stakes of the moment; contrasting this, serene odes to love such as “Say You’ll Go” slow the tempo and minimize the intensity to instead allow her passion to hold increased weight.
 Monáe’s poignant political compass plays a role as well, most overtly in songs such as “Sincerely, Jane” where she sheds her robotic alter ego to address the listener directly: “Are we really living or just walking dead now?” she asks over dignified production that marches along with her as she protests injustices throughout the song. 
Even when she masquerades as Cindi, the very framework of her futuristic world questions social themes as well, with the second-class android race symbolizing the people of color she feels a responsibility to liberate and empower.
 In terms of the sheer magnitude of her artistic concept, Childish Gambino and his character of “the boy” are the only fitting parallels that come to mind, with him being another creative who invented an alternate reality that evolves and expands across several albums. It’s a fair comparison for several reasons: Both Monáe and Donald Glover, the man behind Childish Gambino, have committed to simultaneously building careers outside of music, and both are ahead-of-their-time black artists with countless members of the younger generation  looking to them for inspiration. 
Waiting two months to hear the next installment of Monáe’s Metropolis series might not be easy, but as something to look forward to beyond Black History Month, it’s just another reminder that black excellence isn’t constrained to a single month, or even to history — it’s simply an ongoing fact of life.
Why I’m smiling: Towkio – WWW.
The road to the debut album has been painstaking for the SAVEMONEY rapper, who released his first EP ‘Community Service’ in 2012. Never one to shy away from risking life and limb in the name of his art — the video for “Drift” sees him hanging out the passenger window while his turbo-charged car drifts through the roads of Hawaii — Towkio promoted the new WWW.  by launching himself 100,000 feet into space using a massive helium balloon, releasing the album from outside the atmosphere before falling back to Earth in his capsule. While certainly dangerous and probably unnecessary, it was also the perfect way to grasp “The Overview Effect” of looking down at Earth from outer space, which Towkio says inspired his approach to the album. Kudos for the passion, especially when the music itself is already more than compelling. 
Why I’m shaking my head: Rakim’s manager washes hands of tweet condemning current generation of hip-hop
Legendary New York rapper Rakim was back in the news last week after his Twitter account announced “the death of poetry and smoothness” in the modern realm of hip-hop, but anyone searching for the tweet today (or anything at all, aside from two retweets separated by seven years) will come up empty. Less than an hour after DJBooth reached out to Rakim’s camp about the tweets, virtually all of the page’s history was wiped, and Rakim’s manager emailed the blog to say the account was run by a third party rather than the rapper himself. It’s still unclear whether DJBooth’s question actually sparked the mass deletion, but it’s good to know that the “God MC” isn’t wagging a finger at the young rappers looking to carry the torch in his wake.
Why I’m hopeful for the future: Lil Skies says he won’t be using Xanax or lean
Lil Pump’s Twitter declaration in 2017 that “Xanax is the wave” was unfortunately the truth for much of the year, but now that the surge has passed, it seems hip-hop is ready to watch it ebb back out to sea. The aforementioned SoundCloud rapper rang in the new year by announcing that he was through with the destructive opioid, and now newcomer Lil Skies is swearing off the drug before he’s even tried it. The rapper recently sat down with French outlet Rap Fire Officiel to talk about his music, and had a brutally honest answer for why he doesn’t plan on using: “I’m scared, bro.” Sometimes, instead of lengthy think pieces and well-researched studies, three words is all it takes to drive the message home.

Set in a futuristic Berlin, new Netflix movie Mute tells the story of a Leo, a mute bartender who has lost his ability to speak in a boating accident as a child and refused treatment to restore his voice due to his Amish beliefs. When his girlfriend goes missing, Leo explores the underground world of crime in the city and makes shocking discoveries. Overall, director Duncan Jones — who also directed Moon, Source Code and Warcraft — brought life to a film with an interesting premise, but the actual execution of the film was far from perfect, due to disconnected storylines and acting that’s hard to accept at face value. 
The best acting comes from Alexander Skarsgård in his portrayal of Leo, the voiceless bartender. Acting in a role without dialogue is no easy task, and Skarsgård’s interpretation of  Leo offers a valiant attempt to take on this challenge. In many scenes throughout the film, Skarsgård sustains a silent charisma that brings his character alive. At other times however, the lack of dynamic range in his emotional expression at times offers an unconvincing portrayal of his character and leaves something to be desired. 
Skarsgård’s palatable acting stands in stark contrast to Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux’s portrayals of Cactus Bill and Duck, two black market surgeons working together as partners-in-crime. The two are trying to purchase false identification so Cactus, who is AWOL, can escape Berlin with his daughter. It is not easy to pinpoint exactly why the not-so-dynamic duo was so unwatchable; the ridiculous mustache on Rudd’s character and the silly wig on Theroux’s certainly played a role, but most likely it was their inability to be taken seriously even in their scenes with the most dramatic tension. Ultimately, the characters seemed to be little more than fun but awkward experiments for actors with as much prestige and experience as Rudd and Theroux.

Another weakness of the film was the actual plot itself. The main two storylines — one of Leo and the search for his girlfriend, the other of Cactus and Duck’s black market surgery operations — are extremely disconnected throughout the film. It is not until the end that Jones explains and links the two, which ends up leaving many of the earlier elements of the plot forgotten and some smaller storylines unresolved. 
Additionally, Jones’s inclusion of the theme of pedophilia seems exceptionally misguided. Throughout the movie, the director handles Duck’s pedophilic tendencies in a darkly comedic manner, including humorous scenes where Duck seeks out young-looking prostitutes and becomes frustrated when they admit that they are of legal age. Worst of all, when Cactus finally stands up to Duck about his pedophilic intentions with his underage patients, the two finish their discussion with a nonchalant shopping spree the mall as if the issue had never been brought up. It seems that — much like the rampant onscreen gore throughout the movie — Jones included the subject of pedophilia for its shock value and little else.
Despite the lackluster acting and problematic plot, the visual design of the film shines through. The beautiful visuals match any big budget production showing a cyberpunk-inspired, futuristic world. The stunning cityscape and futuristic technology do not fail to impress in Mute. Indeed, Jones creates an intriguing and interesting universe that exists in the not-too-distant future. However, these outstanding visuals cannot compensate for the other issues painfully present within the movie. As proven by other recent movies, like Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049, compelling visual design does not have to come at the expense of proper plot and character development.
 Mute, however, misses the mark in the hopes that its visual design would be enough. This emphasis on visuals, in conjunction with the awkward acting and mishandled plot, make Mute a painful cyberpunk experiment.

Redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton drives to the basket against Oregon State. In Saturday’s game, he provided a spark off the bench scoring 7 points and recording three steals. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
Cutting through the noise that has disrupted Pac-12 basketball over the past 72 hours, the Trojans stayed laser-focused on the court against the Utah Utes on Saturday. The Trojans (21-9, 12-5) led by as many as 17 in the first half. After the Utes (18-10, 10-7) cut that lead to 6 in the second half, USC responded with with a 16-0 run to take a 71-49 lead. Ultimately, the Trojans won 74-58 thereby completing their first-ever road sweep of the mountain schools. 
On Friday morning, the game seemed like a distant horizon amid news that rattled the USC program, the Pac-12 Conference and numerous programs across the nation. Junior forward Chimezie Metu was named in a Yahoo Sports report about payments by agents to college basketball players or their family members. His eligibility was immediately put into question. Yet again, the state of Trojan basketball was up in the air. Junior forward Bennie Boatwright was also named, but he is out for the season with a knee injury.
That morning, hours before tip-off, USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann released a statement saying that Metu would play after an investigation launched by USC’s Office of Athletic Compliance deemed him eligible.
“Based on the available documents and a number of interviews, we determined that Chimezie is eligible to play in today’s game at Utah,” Swann said in the statement. “If additional information becomes available, we will act accordingly.”
Metu was the centerpiece of the Trojans’ win in Utah, amassing 14 points, nine rebounds and four blocks. He did not look fazed by the swirling allegations.
Nevertheless, the tumultuous state of the conference might have fueled the afternoon’s chippy and physical bout. Both teams garnered multiple technical fouls. It was a statement game. Not only were each team vying for position in the conference tournament but both are also on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament. Furthermore, with the state of Arizona basketball in disarray, both USC and Utah knew that the winner of their match-up could win the Pac-12 if the NCAA strips Arizona of wins. 
Last week, Arizona’s star guard Allonzo Trier was ruled ineligible after testing positive for a banned substance. Yesterday, Arizona head coach Sean Miler was named in an ESPN.com report that alleged FBI wiretaps captured Miller discussing a $100,000 payment to an agent to secure forward Deandre Ayton’s commitment to Arizona.
Having defeated Utah, USC can win the conference if Arizona loses its remaining games and the Trojans defeat UCLA at home next Saturday. Last week, such a scenario was unthinkable, but now it’s up in the air. Miller did not coach Arizona on Saturday, Trier is still ineligible and Ayton might be, too. Amid the hullabaloo, it is impossible to predict what will happen in the Pac-12 over the next week.
On Saturday, the Trojans proved that speculation serves no business on the court. There, only execution matters. Against Utah, the team stepped up and every time the Utes posed a run, the Trojans rebutted with a run of their own.
The bench played exceptionally. Freshman forward Jordan Usher, who must fill part of Boatwright’s void, had a statline similar to what the veteran forward might have produced. He scored 14 points and made four-of-five 3-point attempts. Transfers redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron and redshirt sophomore Derryck Thornton each contributed seven points. In total, USC’s bench scored 31 points.
USC’s deep and well-rounded attack overwhelmed Utah’s defense. The Utes could not guard the fleet-footed Trojans man-to-man, nor could they defend the seams in their zone.
The Trojans should feel satisfied with their position in the conference, but if more bad news about Metu comes, then their postseason could be rained out by a foreboding NCAA thunderstorm of sanctions.

After a thrilling 53-52 overtime win against Utah on Thursday night in which senior forward Kristen Simon hit the game-winning 3-pointer with one second left, the Trojans defeated the Colorado Buffaloes on Saturday afternoon.

Prior to tipoff, the Trojans honored their departing seniors Simon and guards Sadie Edwards and Jordan Adams in front of a packed Galen Center. The three seniors were each given a framed picture of their jersey and had photos taken with their teammates and family members. All three have played integral roles in USC’s success this season as they led the Trojans to a 19-10 record this season. 
“[Edwards] came a long way and I think had a great season,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “[Adams], one of my favorite all-time players, I only had her for a year but what a pleasure it was to coach her … [Simon] has come such a long way and not only as a basketball player but she had a great senior year, she almost averages a double-double and the thing I like about her this year is she grew into her leadership position.”
Both teams came out of the game with a determination to win as the game remained close from the start. Junior guard Aliyah Mazyck netted 11 points alone in the first, but the Trojans trailed 11-17 by the end of the first after an 8-0 Colorado run. The Trojans’ sophomore guard Minyon Moore suffered a minor injury but returned to play in the second quarter. The Trojans came out with a 9-3 run to tie it at 20, but the Buffaloes would regain a small 2-point lead by halftime, 27-25. Mazyck had 13 points but the Trojans shot 33.3 percent as a team in the first half. The Buffaloes were led by guard Quinessa Caylao-Do’s 7 points and forward Mya Hollingshed’s 6 points. 
The Trojans began the second half on a 7-0 run to retake the lead at 32-27 before extending their lead to 10 at 43-33. The Trojans maintained their lead to eventually settle with a 9-point lead at 49-40. In the fourth, the Trojans jumped out further to a 12-point lead at 58-46, and despite the Buffaloes cutting the lead to as close as 7 points, the Trojans would hold on for a 65-53 win. 
“It helped to have [Moore] back on the floor but we talked in the locker room,” Adams said.  “This is our season, this is what we want, we want the tournament then we gotta win this game so I think that really lit a fire under us and we just came out and gave it everything we had.”
Mazyck led the Trojans with 24 points, including 5 3-pointers and nine  rebounds on an efficient 9-for-18 shooting night. Simon had a double-double to the tune of 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Moore, despite getting injured in the first quarter, put up 15 points and two assists. The Trojans shot just 40.4 percent from the field but outrebounded the Buffaloes 40 to 24, outscored them in the paint 28 to 16 and capitalized on second chance opportunities and transition. The Buffaloes were led by Kennedy Leonard’s 19 points and five assists but the team was held to 38 percent shooting and were outplayed in the third quarter, where the Trojans scored 22 to the Buffaloes’ 13. 
“The great thing about our team is that we got some quality wins,” Trakh said. “We haven’t lost to anybody we’re supposed to lose to and we pushed everybody … Every game has been a game they never quit, they have never quit, they’ve been resilient, they fought every single game so I am proud of this group as anybody I have ever coached.”
USC ended its season on a high note, finishing with 19 wins and 10 losses, with a respectable 9-9 in the Pac-12. The Pac-12 women’s basketball tournament begins on Thursday in Seattle, Wash.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
I spent my Friday night watching the Olympic gold medal game for men’s curling. I am not a curling fan. Before Friday, I had never watched curling; I didn’t know the rules of curling; and I didn’t understand how it was scored. 
Team USA was an unlikely winner — all odds were against them. 
After failing to make the cut for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, the team’s skip and three-time Olympian John Shuster formed a “Team of Rejects” with three other spurned athletes. Shuster entered PyeongChang with the disappointment of not only his failure to qualify for Sochi but also an abysmal performance in Vancouver in 2010. Shuster and his teammates began PyeongChang with a mediocre performance in the round robin, failing to show their gold medal potential. 
Nonetheless, the team made it to the semifinals to take on Canada (which has won the gold medal in men’s curling in the last three Winter Olympic Games). America took it to Canada resulting in a 5-3 victory to send the team to the finals, a feat that has never been accomplished by an American curling team. 
As an longtime Olympic fanatic and proud U.S. citizen, I was very eager to see the stars and stripes compete for gold in their first Olympic curling gold medal game appearance.
After quickly looking up a brief explanation of the rules, objectives and strategies of curling, I was able to thoroughly enjoy every minute of the gold medal match. Curling is structured in a 10-round format. These rounds are referred to as ends. A team scores points by placing a stone closer to the center of the bullseye (referred to as “the house”) than their opponents after each team has thrown all of their stones. A team is able to score multiple points by landing multiple stones closer to the center of the house than their opponent.
USA and Sweden were tied at 5 points apiece heading into the eighth end. On a last stone effort, Team USA perfectly placed a takeout to eliminate two Swedish stones and secure 5 points. Not only did the eighth end double the U.S.’s score, but it also practically clinched their gold medal.
After watching the U.S. achieve the improbable, I couldn’t help but to feel a sense of deja-vu. This Cinderella story was exactly what I was talking about in last week’s column, “Olympic hockey is unrivaled excitement.” What I really should have titled it is: “The Olympics are unrivaled excitement.”
The underdog story we witnessed with the U.S. curling team is just one of the many unlikely success stories from PyeongChang. This Olympic games reminded me very much of “Miracle on Ice.” In both games, we saw a ragtag team of rejects take down a powerhouse to ultimately win gold. What more of a spectacle could you want? I live for these moments in sports. 
These athletes deserve recognition and praise. Sure, curling might not be as dazzling as Nathan Chen’s figure skating routine or as high intensity as a Shaun White halfpipe performance, but the U.S. curling team delivered a strong message to its spectators: fall down seven times, get up eight. Whether you are a rising athlete, blue or white collar worker or a student like me, everyone can find a way to apply this lesson to their life. 
Sports have a way of reaching audiences more successfully than many conventional ways. I have learned so many valuable lessons from playing and watching sports. Perhaps the most notable is to believe in myself. For a significant portion of my life, I doubted my abilities to perform. I never felt that I would be good enough or that I would live up to my own expectations. My baseball career taught me to live life like I played baseball: walk around with a chip on your shoulder and understand what you’re capable of.
When I was behind the plate, I knew I could throw out the guy stealing on me — I just had to believe I could do it. The same notion applies to my daily life as a student. I know I can write a solid paper for my WRIT 150 course — I just have to put my doubts aside and believe I can write a great paper.
All in all, I think the Olympics is truly a fascinating event that does so much more than entertain. I am truly sad that they are now over, but I am so glad we had the opportunity to learn so much from these spectacular athletes.

The basement of Leavey Library has transformed from a silent study bubble to a bustling hub of pink shirts, sleeping bags and young women furiously typing away on laptops. It’s the second day of AthenaHacks, an all-female hackathon providing an array of workshops, panels, tech talks and free food. 
The AthenaHacks founders created the all-female event to eliminate pressures associated with hackathons that are traditionally dominated by and oriented toward male programmers. Yuwei Xi | Daily Trojan
Ilona Bodnar, a junior majoring in media arts and practice, is one of the co-founders of AthenaHacks and is part of the event’s finance team. She and the other women who founded this hackathon wanted to eliminate the pressure and intensity that come from these typically male-dominated events.
“Coding is sort of like the new literacy, like we need to know how to read and write,” Bodnar said. “And in this day and age, we really feel that if you want to make a big impact, you need to know at least a little bit of how computers work.”
With more than fifteen sponsors this year, including Facebook, Google and Microsoft, AthenaHacks was able to provide transportation for participants from universities across Southern California. Zynga, a social game developer based in San Francisco, sponsored AthenaHacks and hosted a Unity Workshop and a Women in Games Panel this weekend.
“I was so amazed by the organization, by the AthenaHacks team and just by all the excitement and energy that the female hackers have here,” said Emily Kuo, the university relations program manager for Zynga. She said that recruiting more women has been a goal for the company.
“Most of our players [at Zynga] are female,” Kuo said. “So it just makes sense to be in a space where our hackers or our engineers in tech are female as well.” 
A group of three students from UC San Diego — juniors Samantha Stone, Yasmine Nassar and Sarah Ji — came to the hackathon with the initial plan of creating an Android app, but were inspired to change their app idea into a website after attending one of the hackathon’s web development workshops, where they learned HTML and CSS. 
Ji said she was excited about being in an all-female environment.
“I just think the environment is really cool and the idea of having an all-female hackathon because as previously mentioned, it is a male-dominated field,” Ji said.  “So it’s really cool to focus on women in tech and highlight that.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Ilona Bodnar’s name. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Hundreds of scuba divers gathered at Catalina Island for the 37th annual Avalon Harbor Underwater Cleanup on Saturday to collect trash from the ocean. 
The 37th annual Avalon Harbor Underwater Cleanup was put on by the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies Conservancy Divers and the USC Catalina Hyperbaric Chamber on Saturday. Photo courtesy of Jim Key.
The event was put on by the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies Catalina Conservancy Divers and the USC Catalina Hyperbaric Chamber, which treats dive accidents throughout Southern California. Proceeds from the event benefit both programs.
Ten USC students participated in this year’s cleanup, eight of whom were members of the USC Scuba Dive Club. Club president Forrest Lee, a senior studying environmental studies and business administration, said that the fee waiver for USC students helped increase participation in the cleanup. 
According to Katie Chvostal, the director of the Friends of Wrigley Institute, divers found items ranging from fishing rods and wine bottles from 1999 to a large rug. Andre Mershad, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, found a t-shirt and a plastic fork while cleaning up.
“Anything you could think of was down there,” Mershad said. 
Mershad said that he fell in love with diving after receiving his diving certification last summer, which was a main reason he chose to study environmental science. 
“I wanted to make a direct impact on some environmental issue and plastic pollution in the ocean is a huge problem,” Mershad said. “I thought I could make a small but direct impact by coming out today.”
Chvostal said that the event was organized with Avalon Environmental Services to dispose of the trash they found. All of the metal is taken back to the mainland to be processed and recycled while the rest of the trash goes to the landfill on the island. Chvostal said that they usually collect about two and a quarter tons of trash and will know how much trash was collected this year later in the week. 
According to Chvostal, 100 volunteers sorted the trash found on land and served in the kayak patrol, which monitors the conditions of the water in the harbor, while 400 volunteers dove in the water to collect trash. 
Chvostal said that from this event, there was a sense of community among the divers who picked up trash.
“It’s really wonderful to see so many people band together and do something to benefit the health of our oceans,” Chvostal said.

Ashwin Bhumbla already knows that he wants to change the world.
Viterbi students participated in a Skype conference call Friday where they were able to speak to eight refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Lebanon and Syria now living in Europe. Natalie Bettendorf | Daily Trojan
In his engineering diplomacy class last semester, which was taught by USC Viterbi School of Engineering professor Najmedin Meshkati last semester, Bhumbla said that one particular idea stuck with him: the idea of being a global engineer rather than a cubicle engineer.
“Of course, working at Google and Apple … It’s a dream,” said Bhumbla, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “You’re pushing your technology, you’re making it, but then you start thinking, what’s it all for and who is it all for? … What’s the point if not everybody can have access to the old technology, the old improvements?”
Being in Meshkati’s class and getting involved in USC’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders encouraged Bhumbla to attend an event hosted by Viterbi in Ronald Tutor Hall Friday morning. At the event, Meshkati and Daniel Druhora, a senior digital content producer at the Viterbi Communications and Marketing group, hosted a Skype conference with eight refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Lebanon who are all currently living in various countries in Europe.
A dozen people were in attendance, including students, faculty and alumni. The conference call lasted about two hours, with refugees recounting their experiences in camps and answering questions from USC participants about what kinds of innovations would help increase the safety and effectiveness of these camps.
“The purpose of this conference call is to start dialogue between USC students, faculty and potential refugees,” Meshkati said in the email invitation for the event. “This would provide a great opportunity for us to learn more about (educated) young refugee circumstances who are either sitting ‘idle’ in refugee camps or in ‘limbo’ waiting for to be processed and how we can better frame this program for both USC and refugee students.”
Druhora explained that this conference was an important step for designing a class that could be launched as early as Fall 2018. The class will have 12 USC students and 12 refugee students working together to solve a problem involved in the refugee crisis with an engineering focus.
“They can split up into teams, they can identify the problem and then start to work on researching, interviewing, doing the whole process,” Druhora said. “That would be the first semester. The second semester, they would start to work on the problem, they start the prototype, they start to design things … Then it would all culminate in a meeting. So like you saw today, they’re meeting them virtually. [But] at the end of the program, they would meet them in-person.”
Kayla Soren, a sophomore majoring in international relations and environmental studies, also called in for the Skype conference. Even though she is currently in the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences program in Washington, D.C., she has been working with Meshkati and Druhora to launch a refugee virtual exchange project at USC. She has been helping them develop a student-driven, research-based curriculum that would encourage students to not only think about global issues, but also become active in creating necessary change.
“I just felt this intense passion and I will do anything it takes to make this a success,” Soren said. “It really frustrates me, especially seeing today, like doesn’t something like this already exist? Why aren’t universities doing anything?”
After the event, Bhumbla said that he was particularly struck when one refugee said that no one chooses to be a refugee.
“When you start thinking about ‘Why am I at this school? What am I learning engineering for?’ the answer, I think, no matter what you’re learning, is to help people,” Bhumbla said.
