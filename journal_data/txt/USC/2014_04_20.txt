With technology rapidly and continually advancing, it’s interesting to try to figure how regular Americans feel about what awaits us. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in conjunction with Smithsonian Magazine concluded that though the majority of Americans are optimistic about the future of technology, many feel skeptical about specific advancements and how they will affect society.
Though Americans seem overwhelmingly positive about technology — even more so for individuals with a college education — a consistent thread throughout the poll is that Americans aren’t yet comfortable with technology that could either augment a person beyond his or natural means or sacrifice his or her control over technology.
The notable statistics in the poll seem to reveal inherent concerns with health augmentation especially. Among those polled, 66 percent think it would be a change for the worse if people could alter the DNA of their offspring, and 53 percent of Americans think society would be worse off if most people wore implants or devices that could reveal information about the world around them. Just a scant 26 percent of respondents to the poll said they would get a brain implant that could improve their intelligence or memory.
A fear about security and privacy also seems to be a consistent thread throughout the poll, with 63 percent saying that it would be a change for the worse if personal and commercial drones were given permission to fly through American airspace. Drones have been a trending concern for their militaristic implications and the possibility of commercial use (Amazon has already proposed using drones to deliver certain packages).
The other thing to note in the poll is that Americans remain hesitant to leave things up entirely to a machine. Fifty percent of Americans said they would not be willing to ride in a driverless car, in spite of the fact that there has been consistent evidence, in particular with the driverless Google cars, that an automated vehicle is much safer. Sixty-five percent said they would not be comfortable with robot caregivers watching over the elderly or children.
There also seems to be misplaced expectations regarding long-term technological advancements.  Thirty-nine percent of Americans believe that scientists will have figured out teleportation (Star Trek might have made this seem too viable) in the next 50 years and 33 percent think we’ll have space colonies by 2064.
Though this might be disappointing to a technological optimist, given the state of our culture as well as the perception of technology’s potential pitfalls, it’s not very surprising. The notion of creating “custom babies” brings up an uncomfortable notion of genetic superiority, not to mention the implication that the rich would almost assuredly have an advantage since it’s doubtful the service would be cheaply available. Americans’ skepticism of automated technology such as a driverless car is consistent with our societal need to have control over something we own. We still are reluctant to leave things in the hands of a machine.
Now all of this might have to do with Americans’ overall feelings for the future. Americans are unsure about the future five years from now — forget what technology might evolve to 50 years down the road. The National Security Agency has made everyone scared about the notion of privacy in the digital world even as society relies on a digital profile more and more each day.
The fact that the advancements Americans feel most positive about are health-related shows that many of us are more concerned about our mortality than the prospect of hospitable robotics or artificial physical advancements improving our lives, possibly at the cost of losing what makes us human. Many of these advancements are not only inevitable but will also become mainstream sooner than anyone is expecting. It’s going to be hard to win over a skeptical public, but at the moment, Americans are concerned with the present. And when the future finally arrives, there’s no telling what the state of the country will be and how that will change our perceptions.

The last thing the world needs is another chick flick. It’s all been done before: the love triangle, the high school flashbacks, the struggles of a suburban-turned-city girl and the predictable story line that always ends with a happy ending. Though The Other Woman falls right into this category of light-hearted films, it’s exciting to see Hollywood’s favorite actresses work together in what is sure to be the new go-to movie for all those girls’ nights in.

The Other Woman hopes to prove that unfortunate circumstances can bring people of different backgrounds and personalities together. Though Cameron Diaz’s, Leslie Mann’s and Kate Upton’s characters couldn’t be more different, they are forced to team up because the ladies share one commonality: the same man, Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau).
Diaz plays Carly Whitten, a tough New York lawyer with a strict set of rules when it comes to relationships after years of bad luck in the dating game. After discovering her boyfriend is married to Kate (Mann), a preppy suburban housewife, Carly tries to move on, but Kate makes it impossibly difficult when she shows up at her office for advice. Instead of directing their outrage at each other as viewers would expect, the two bond over their joint enemy, and with the help of Amber (Upton), the third woman, they conspire to come up with the perfect revenge.
While Carly is a strong, independent woman, Kate has given up her former life, friends and job to be a suburban housewife. And then there’s Amber, a young bombshell with much to learn from her two older girlfriends. Heartbroken and angry, the trio investigates Mark’s life and finds a dirty secret they know will ruin him.
“I think we’ve all gone through some kind of betrayal, whether it’s [with] a boy, friend or family,” Diaz said at a press conference. The two other actresses nodded their heads in agreement, adding that the familiar feeling of disloyalty is what helped get them into character.
The film also embodies the old saying that “sometimes all you need is an old friend, a good chat and a slightly expensive bottle of wine.” The Other Woman will have you wishing that you were best buds with the cast. From playing dress-up at Carly’s Manhattan apartment to scheming behind their lover’s back, the actresses even make being vengeful mistresses seem like fun. Their chemistry continues off-screen too.
Mann explained at the press conference that she and Diaz went out for a four-hour dinner in New York City in addition to the cast dinner. “We kind of hit it off right away — luckily,” she said. “Cameron is my teacher and Kate is like my daughter.”
As for Upton, who is known for her two Sports Illustrated Swimwear Edition covers, The Other Woman is the first movie the supermodel has starred in.
“It was so amazing. I’m so lucky,” Upton said. “I didn’t know what to expect and they [Diaz and Mann] welcomed me right away and supported me throughout.”
The film has all the ingredients to be a successful chick flick at the box office. Besides having three hilarious actresses, pop star Nicki Minaj adds just the right amount of sass in her role as Carly’s secretary. Despite the cast being predominantly female, the two main actors definitely do not get overshadowed by the girl power on set. Coster-Waldau and Taylor Kinney, Lady Gaga’s model-turned-actor boyfriend, were a pleasure to work with, all three actresses said at the press conference.
“I was so excited to make out with him I broke out with hives,” Mann said of Coster-Waldau, who stars in Game of Thrones.
Moreover, producer Julie Yorn was able to tap Nick Cassavetes, known for directing The Notebook, to direct the movie.
“I have a strong mother, daughters and sisters,” Cassavetes said after reading the script for Yorn’s project.  “I have a strong connection to women, and I really love what this movie says about the power of female relationships.”
Another person who Yorn was excited to work with is Patricia Field, one of the most sought-after designers for motion picture and television projects. Her earlier works include The Devil Wears Prada and Sex and the City, which earned her Academy Award and Emmy Award nominations, respectively.
The Other Woman might sound a lot like all the other romantic comedies out there, but that’s only because it is. The cast, producer and director all know this and choose to embrace it in every way; they do not try to make the story seem more serious than it really is. They also know, however, that they’ve created a movie women will enjoy watching over and over again — and that is what makes them proud.

In a city overflowing with frozen yogurt shops, a simple ice cream cone can be difficult to track down. CVT Soft Serve, a new food truck launched by USC alumnus Joe Nicchi, brings high-quality soft serve ice cream to Los Angeles.

Nicchi, originally from upstate New York, has fond memories of going out for ice cream as a child. He strives to replicate this special experience for people.
“I quickly learned, as an East Coast transplant here, that soft serve was very hard to find,” Nicchi said.
CVT offers two classic flavors, chocolate and vanilla, that are made using a secret family recipe. Additionally, people who wish to try both options can order a chocolate-vanilla twist.
“My father has been making this ice cream out of the back of his restaurant for the past 30 years,” Nicchi said. “And I told him, ‘We gotta do this. We gotta bring it out here.’”
According to Nicchi, most soft-serve purveyors in Los Angeles use a 5 percent milk-fat blend, which yields a thin and grainy consistency. Unsatisfied with this generic option, Nicchi created a custom mix in partnership with a local dairy.
“The majority of soft serve ice cream on the market is low-fat, which is like a 5 percent mix or a 5 percent butter-fat,” Nicchi said. “Our percentage is significantly higher than that. Instantly, you can taste the difference.”
Nicchi keeps the menu simple in order to showcase his high-quality product. While the ice cream is wonderful on its own, creamy and subtly sweet, customers may crown their cone in chocolate and rainbow sprinkles or sea salt.
The sea salt topping is particularly unique. Using a pepper grinder, Nicchi coats the entire cone in a fine layer of salt. This sea salt powder offsets the ice cream’s richness, creating a pleasant contrast on your tongue.
“You go to any of these self-service yogurt places, and I just watch people dump tons of toppings on these things. They’re covering up something that’s not that good to begin with,” Nicchi said. “What’s the point? If you’re gonna treat yourself, get something that actually tastes good to begin with.”
Though people rave about the ice cream, they are also smitten with the truck itself. Nicchi spent one year searching for the 1961 vintage ice cream truck and an additional two years restoring it.
Affectionately dubbed “Charlie,” the brown and white beauty reflects CVT’s charmingly simple aesthetic.
“I was obsessed with the idea of getting a cool truck,” Nicchi said.
This attention to detail has paid off. After spotting Charlie on the freeway, a groom called Nicchi and booked CVT to serve at his wedding.
“This is L.A., and people like the full package,” Nicchi said. “[This] was very much image-involved.”
Nicchi studied theatre at USC, which helped him build his business with a director’s vision.
“I was trying to create an experience that wasn’t just walking up to a typical lunch truck. It feels like a production in a weird way,” Nicchi said.
Even though CVT opened only a month ago, it has already gained a loyal following.
“I was definitely concerned as a new business owner,” Nicchi said. “You know, since this is a health-conscious town, are people not gonna respond well. And it’s been the complete opposite. We’ve had a ton of repeat business.”
Focusing on top-notch ingredients and outstanding execution, CVT elevates soft serve ice cream into a standout dessert. In a town obsessed with excess, Nicchi’s “back to basics” approach is truly refreshing.

The USC Auto Club hosted USC’s first annual auto show on Sunday, featuring approximately 50 cars parked along Trousdale Parkway from a variety of dealerships and sports car clubs around California. The event was hosted in conjunction with the show’s sponsors, such as Audi of Downtown Los Angeles, Fiat of Los Angeles and Motor Village LA.

Aaron Bajor, a sophomore majoring in business administration and president of the USC Auto Club, was responsible for hosting the event alongside a team of nearly 20 others from the club.
Bajor founded the club last year as a freshman, and it has seen it grow to more than 300 students who also network with clubs at other universities including University of California, Los Angeles, University of California-San Diego, University of California-Irvine and Santa Monica College.
“We wanted to do something really cool, really big, and that not only provides for and invites the entire Trojan community, but invites other people to our campus as well,” Bajor said.
The show featured personal cars that belonged to students, such as modified BMW 335i M Sport and an old-school Porsche Carrera, as well as cars from dealerships, including Audi cars with their lineup of the A3, A4 and A5. There were also three Dodge Chargers and a variety of Fiat 500 models.
The show included many supercars, such as a volcano-red Aston Martin V8 Vantage, a white Audi R8 V10, a yellow Lamborghini Aventador and a titanium-gray Ferrari F430.
Bajor stated that the club wanted to put on a similar event last year, but they were held back by insufficient planning, time and money. This year, however, the club began publicizing the event through a variety of social media platforms as well as at car events throughout Southern California.
Andrew Palmer, a professional race car driver and sophomore at Pomona College, was also at the event. Last fall, Palmer won the world championship in the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo Series and also helped bring some of Lamborghini’s cars to USC on Sunday.
“I emailed Lamborghini of Beverly Hills since I have a really good relationship with them — I was actually driving a Beverly Hills car when I won the world championship,” he said. “They were happy to bring out an Aventador and an Aston Martin and put on a good show for all the people here.”
Even though the event fell on Easter Sunday as well as on the second weekend of the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, many students stopped by to learn about the cars and take pictures.
Palmer said that the event was a good starting point for future shows.
“It’s low-key, but it’s a fantastic start, and it definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of people coming out,” Palmer said. “It’s really nice to have these awesome cars on display that don’t get to get seen all the time.”
Anokhy Desai, a junior majoring in business administration, said that she had been looking forward to the event and that the Aston Martin was her favorite car there.
“I didn’t realize that one of my friends was so involved in the Auto Club and that they’ve been planning this for a year,” Desai said. “It was so exciting when they actually made it happen as a Facebook event —— I was like, ‘I want to come to campus on a Sunday!’”
Bajor stated that the club hoped to hold events like this in the future.
“It’s totally the plan to have a second one,” said Bajor. “More than anything, it was a chance to get the word out on campus that our club exists.”
Bajor also hoped that the event would contribute to car culture on campus.
“I love just seeing [passersby] smiling — that’s what makes me happy and what makes the event a success in my opinion.”

On Saturday, approximately 80 students representing 15 schools gathered in Taper Hall of the Humanities to participate in the Global Brigades Exchange hosted at USC. The event allowed student leaders and program participants from various campuses to convene and discuss the different programs, as well as learn about the organization and its history.
“It’s an opportunity for other brigaders to come out and share best practices, their stories and make connections so if they want to collaborate in future, or get feedback, they can do that here,” said Kevin Chuang, a junior majoring in business administration and one of the principal organizers of the event.
Global Brigades is a  student-led, nonprofit organization that sends teams of students to work on development projects in Central America and West Africa, focusing on the specific academic interests of the students involved. In total, there are ten disciplines represented including medical, dental, engineering, environmental, architecture, public health and water brigades.
“We’re the largest  student-led sustainable development organization, helping communities reach a point of sustainability through a number of different disciplines,” Chuang said. “We do that gradually, brigade by brigade, until they reach that point of sustainability.”
USC not only sends students on brigades, but also played a significant role in the formation of the organization itself. Steve Atamian, a USC alumnus, helped found the organization shortly after graduating in 2004. Atamian said USC was instrumental in getting the organization off the ground.
“USC was the second or third school to adopt Global Brigades, and in the first year they carried us, bringing down a group of 100 to 120 students, that gave us the funds to hire locals and keep health projects going year-round,” Atamian said. “Without that momentum it would have been really hard to get started.”
Since then, the organization has grown from 20 volunteers to 10,000 this year from across North America and Europe, according to Atamian. Global Brigades has chapters at over 250 campuses so far.
“We’re able to do complex development work just by mobilizing students,” Atamian said. “All the ideas of our organization come from the students, we just provide an infrastructure to empower them and take things to the next level.”
Students participated in collaborative activities, listened to speakers and had breakout sessions for discussion throughout the exchange, which lasted from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday. Students from various schools said the event was helpful and productive.
“What we’re doing here is getting to know the leadership and brigaders from other schools around [Southern California], and we all have this common goal and vision as being members and leaders in [Global Brigades],” said Sahana Kribakaran, a junior at UCLA who served as the campus chair of UCLA’s Global Brigades chapter. “But we all operate and do things differently on our campus, and we know what works and doesn’t work. Today is about exchanging those ideas, and sharing this common goal.”
Kribakaran has been involved with Global Brigades since her first year when she went on a medical brigade to Honduras. Since then, she has been on two more brigades to Ghana, and has taken on a more active role in the leadership of the organization at UCLA.
“Our whole vision is students empowering communities and communities empowering students,” Kribakaran said. “It’s the central theme of empowerment that really drives the organization to do what we do, promoting quality of life through initiatives and create positive social change by using the energy of students.”
Other students gained advice and inspiration. Lacy Williams, a sophomore majoring in architectural engineering at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, said she learned valuable recruiting techniques that will be helpful in building up the chapter at her campus.
“It was great to hear tips on how to recruit people and keep them engaged,” Williams said. “Teaching people that they’re not volunteering for themselves but for the community, and they’re not fundraising for themselves, but for the community.”
Monserratee Angeles, a senior majoring in human biology at UC San Diego, said she found the stories of other brigaders the most important part of the event.
“The stories that I’ve heard, they seem really passionate about what they’re doing,” Angeles said. “They keep coming back because they want to continue to help people in these communities in other places and they really worry about sustaining people in the organization.”

Akm Alam has been going to work at the same place for over three decades: his Quik-Pix Photo & Digital Lab shop at the University Village. That will all come to an end on May 1, the date Alam will move out due to USC’s impending renovation of the University Village into the USC Village.
Closing doors · Akm Alam (above) has been the owner of Quik-Pix, a photo processing shop in the University Village, for over 30 years. Quick Pix is just one of the many businesses that will have to relocate due to the University Village’s renovation. – Christine Yoo | Daily Trojan
“It is heartbreaking,” Alam said. “I’ve been here 33 years. I’m the very oldest tenant, you could say.”
The move is a long time coming. Alam said that USC has put him on a month-to-month lease since 2010, making it hard for him to keep his shop running.
“It definitely killed our business,” he said. “Business you always have to look ahead.”
Though he used to have two employees, one full-time and one part-time, he could not keep them because of the uncertainty surrounding his lease. Other shops have closed up and moved out altogether, leaving the University Village a virtual ghost town.
That will change soon, however, as USC’s proposal to renovate the University Village, plans that have been in place since 2010, is finally on the brink of action.
USC has invested $1 billion into the reconstruction of the University Park campus. This USC Village project was approved in 2012 by the Los Angeles City Council and stands as the largest development of its kind in South Los Angeles history.
The new USC Village is expected to include more than 2 million square feet of retail, new student housing and academic space, according to the project’s website. The vast majority of this space will be dedicated to housing, while a much smaller portion will be retail space.
“I don’t think it will help the community, that’s my personal opinion,” Alam said. “Right now this is a completely commercial area … USC [Village] is only 160,000 square feet for retail. You can do the math.”
USC officials say the Village aims to serve the community while simultaneously increasing the quality of student life for USC students. According to a university press release, “the existing USC-owned regional shopping center … is dated, has limited retail offerings, and needs to be replaced.”
Current University Village business owners, such as Alam, employees and frequent customers, however, have taken the news of reconstruction with heavy hearts.
“It is what it is,” said Itzhak Mughaean, owner of Touch of Class, a hair salon, a business that is over 40 years old. “Of course I’m upset. But there is nothing I can do about it, USC owns the land.”
The uncertainty surrounding the University Village renovation during the last few years has plagued small businesses more than national retailer chains. Though Alam had to let his employees go, business chains such as Burger King, Denny’s and Superior can offer jobs to their employees at other locations in the area.
“Every one of our employees has been promised a position at another location,” said Jose Vargas, the manager at Superior Grocers. “The move is mostly inconvenient to the customers from the surrounding community who shop here frequently due [to] our low prices. A lot of students have also expressed their disappointment.”
Some employees discussed the negative impact USC’s decision could have on its students.
“We have customers that come in at the same time every morning. They are the ones being affected most,” said Daniel Alvarez, manager of Denny’s. “Most of the employees will be covered, but some will be left behind.”
Ingrid Virgin, an employee at Denny’s, grew sentimental at the thought of leaving University Village.
“This was my first job ever, and I ended up staying for nine years. I’ll be sad to see it go,” Virgin said. “Luckily my job is safe. That’s more than I can say for everyone here.”
One of USC’s project goals is to create 12,000 new jobs through the construction process and, more permanently, through employment in the new establishments, according to the press release. They have also promised to generate substantial tax revenue, which will give back to the community.
USC Civic Engagement senior vice president Craig Keys defended the University Village’s remodel and its potential effect on current business owners and their employees.
“The university has been working with Village tenants throughout this process to identify needs and concerns and to provide support services,” Keys said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Keys also noted the positive effects the reconstruction would have on the university’s surrounding neighborhoods.
“Additionally, the university has committed to implementing a range of community benefit services that will enhance community access to local jobs, recreational opportunities, educational opportunities and professional services for many years to come,” Keys said in the email.
For business owners such as Alam, though, the changes have been hard. Alam is currently looking for a new place to relocate his business because he does not believe he will be able to return to University Village once it has become the USC Village.
“It wouldn’t be so bad if the university had promised that we could eventually return,” Alam said. “We have been here for so many years, you know? Everyone knows how good we all are. So why not give us some kind of preference?”
Thanks so much for writing this DT! It’s so important for students to hear from community members about this new renovation! Because students have a say in this new plan!
Fill out this survey to let USC know what you want to see in the new USC VIllage! And please include “local businesses owned by members of the community” in the section where they allow you to suggest business you would frequent!!

With the baseball gripped proudly in his ungloved hand, USC senior catcher Garrett Stubbs signaled to the umpire that he had indeed made the improbable catch up against the fence of his own dugout. The ball had ricocheted off senior first baseman Jake Hernandez, and danced from Stubbs’s bare hand before it was finally trapped against his chest. It didn’t matter if it seemed like he wasn’t going to catch it; he did, and that was all that mattered.

So the season has gone for the Trojans, who sometimes bobble the ball, and yet still find ways to come up with it in the end. This weekend’s three-game series sweep against the Arizona Wildcats was the triumphant fist, and gives the team, now 9-9 in conference play and 20-17 overall, a boost of confidence with a couple extra days of rest.
“I’m excited for the guys,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs. “They kept their energy up all weekend long and, come on, in the past we don’t win a one-nothing, two-nothing game and a 5-4 game in 12 [innings] against a good team that can hit, so for us it was big.”
Senior starter Bob Wheatley, who had the team’s second-lowest ERA in 2013, returned to form in timely fashion in Saturday’s game, which was televised on the Pac-12 Networks. Wheatley pitched seven shutout innings, his first start tossing more than four innings since the loss to UCLA on March 9. The left-hander allowed only three runners to reach base, two singles and a walk, in Saturday’s 2-0 victory.
Hubbs said that Wheatley had been “all out of whack” since the Cal Poly series at the beginning of March and that in the subsequent weeks, they’d been reviewing tape and trying to work out the kinks during bullpen sessions. Hubbs was pleased with what he saw on Saturday.
“He looked more like Bobby because he’s been real erratic the past few weeks, missing up out over the plate,” Hubbs said. “Today he was down in the zone and fastball command was really good, changeup command was really good. That’s who he is.”
Wheatley said he’d been struggling with his command, throwing balls and issuing too many walks. He admitted that his pitching performance had been putting pressure on his defense, which in turn came up big during Saturday’s game.
It was finally identifying the problem that gave Wheatley confidence, even when his offense couldn’t plate runs until the seventh inning.
“As a pitcher, you have one job and that’s to get hitters out and the way you do that is just attacking the glove,” Wheatley said. “So I just have to remind myself a few times of that, just because it’s human nature, but there was no doubt we were going to come up with a couple of runs.”
On Friday, junior left fielder Omar Cotto helmed his second walk-off of this season, the eighth total for USC. This time Cotto’s hit was a game-winning single in the bottom of the 12th, and he was rewarded with a pie to the face during a post-game interview. Cotto’s previous walk-off was a three-run monster home run (the first of his collegiate career) against North Dakota State in February.
Cotto’s single on Friday was one of 16 for the Trojans, whose pitching staff held the Wildcats to only five. A tag-team of sophomore pitchers, Brent Wheatley and Kyle Twomey, kept the Trojans in  contention for the win. The latter hurled five complete innings of one-hit ball, at one point retiring 14 consecutive batters.
The weekend of consistent pitching began with junior Wyatt Strahan’s dominant performance on Friday. Last week, Strahan recorded a career-high 11 strikeouts, only to one-up himself in Thursday’s game. The 6-foot-3 right-hander threw his first career complete-game shutout against a team that, heading into the series, led the Pac-12 conference in batting average.
“Wyatt really pitched fantastic on Friday and I think he kind of just showed the way for everybody,” Hubbs said. “I think what it did is it gave confidence to everybody else that they could do the same thing.”
Baseball is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. For the Trojans, performing well is contagious, as evidenced by Strahan’s outing, which propelled the team to a sweep, culminating in Wheatley’s stellar Saturday start. With the performances on the mound (and off it, in the field or behind the dish) starting to strengthen, Hubbs sees a depth that can help the team inch toward contention in the Pac-12.
Next on the schedule is Hawai’i  on Tuesday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field, but Hubbs can’t help but look forward to knocking off the defending national champions and crosstown rival, UCLA, in a series that begins on Thursday.
“They’re a good team. We know that they pitch really well, they get timely hits and they play solid defense and that’s what we think we do,” Hubbs said. “So it’ll be a good series.”

It’s no secret that brand names drive TV ratings in sports. The NFL, the NBA and college football are all the same in this regard: Big names sell tickets and draw attention. As legendary as Boise State’s victory over Oklahoma was in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, it was also one of the lowest-rated games of that entire bowl season — Not due to a lack of excitement, but because Boise State doesn’t drum up the same interest from a casual fan as a team such as USC or Notre Dame would.

The same goes for the Rose Bowl. Hardcore football fans aside, TCU facing off against Wisconsin doesn’t really get the blood pumping the same way a USC-Michigan matchup might. This all serves to underscore the point that college football is generally better when storied programs such as Alabama, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Oklahoma and USC are all competitive.
Unfortunately, over the last 15 years there has not been a period where all five of these schools, as well as other national brands such as Texas, Michigan and Nebraska, have all been elite programs. The teams that have been good — Alabama and Ohio State — carried the quality of college football last year. Their dominance on the gridiron happened to coincide with one of the greatest back-to-back game sequences in recent history: Ohio State’s 43-42 victory over Michigan followed up by Auburn’s last-second heroic upset over Alabama.
Most of college football follows this model. The Red River Shootout is best when both Oklahoma and Texas are formidable squads. Recently, the games have been one-sided affairs without true national championship implications. The same can be said about the battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh between Notre Dame and USC. Only once in the last 15 years has the game had national title implications for both teams. That game ended in glorious fashion, with the famous (or infamous) Bush Push sealing a USC victory.
These are the types of games that go down in college football history, and cement these programs’ legacies in the pantheon of powerhouse college football programs. Yet the BCS era suffered from a roller coaster ride for most of these teams. No single program has been able to maintain national relevance the entire time, and college football has suffered.
The transformation to a new playoff system might also mark a return to dominance for most, if not all, of these schools. They are now equipped with hefty TV contracts, talented recruiters and coaches, and are oozing with elite talent. The excitement is building, and it looks as if the next few years will mark the beginning of a possible golden age for college football.
Take USC for example. Even before the departure of Pete Carroll and the draconian sanctions levied by the NCAA, USC was trending toward obscurity. After Mark Sanchez left a possible national championship on the table when he declared for the draft, USC regressed with freshman Matt Barkley at the helm. That season ended on a dreary night pre-New Year’s in a fairly vacant AT&T Park in San Francisco at the Emerald Bowl.
For one of the premier programs in all of sports, playing before New Year’s in a sponsored bowl doesn’t exactly evoke memories of Howard Jones or John McKay. Since that point, the Trojans have been better known nationally for off-the-field issues than on-the-field success. Only once, during a six week period in Matt Barkley’s junior season, did USC’s play generate excitement and buzz around the program and nationally as well. For that short period, USC was “USC” again. Barkley’s announcement was telecasted live on ESPN, and analysts were in frenzy when he announced his intentions to return for his senior season.
Besides that, USC has made the news primarily when footballs mysteriously deflate, jerseys switch mid-game, 5-star recruits decommit, or coaches are fired in airport hangars. All of that looks to become a distant memory under the new reign of Sarkisian and company. If Saturday’s spring game was any indication, there is palpable electricity within the program once again.
The excitement certainly isn’t at the level of national championship teams of the mid 2000’s, but there is a quicker, more frenetic pace to this team. Sure, some might worry about how spring practice and the game showcased an offense struggling with a new system. Given an offseason of work, however, the players will surely gain familiarity and comfort with the up-tempo attack.
The defense is once again in attack mode, with aggressive defenders at every level emerging into legitimate ball hawks. Though it would be foolish to extrapolate too much from the spring session, it does appear that the Trojan team is back on the right track. Coach Steve Sarkisian seem to understand the intangibles that go along with the X’s and O’s of football: meeting with boosters and being friendly with the press.
It might not happen overnight, but soon enough the Trojans will be at the top of the polls again. They will once again be relevant for the right reasons: victories and historic rivalries. It is good for the Pac-12 and good for college football as other top teams also make the climb back up with USC. It might sound like an obnoxious elitist fan’s claim, but when USC and others are good, college football is just that much better.

USC’s No. 8-ranked men’s volleyball team ended its 2014 season in the quarterfinals of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament this weekend, falling in three sets to No. 4 BYU, 25-13, 25-18 and 25-17. USC finishes the season 16-11 overall and 14-10 in conference play.
Cold-blooded killer · MPSF Freshman of the Year Lucas Yoder led the Trojans with 10 kills and six digs in USC’s season-ending loss to BYU. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
The Trojans faltered early in the first set as top-seeded BYU forced errors from USC’s defense. The team fell to an early 5-0 deficit, forcing head coach Bill Ferguson to call a time out. After the timeout, freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder put USC on the board with a kill, and senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin added two consecutive kills to bring the score to 8-3 in BYU’s favor.
Back-to-back errors by the Cougars cut the lead to 9-5, though more USC errors lengthened BYU’s lead to 12-5 and forced another USC timeout. Despite kills by McKibbin and junior setter Micah Christenson, BYU continued its offensive success coming out of the timeout, while USC continued to struggle, and the Cougars took the first set, 25-13.
USC’s 13 points were the fewest the team has seen in a 25-point set since getting 13 against Hawai’i in 2002.
Kills by freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh, senior opposite hitter Tanner Jansen and McKibbin kept the Trojans in the game to start the second set. Junior outside hitter Chris Lischke added a kill of his own to make the score 8-6 in BYU’s favor. BYU had an answer for every offensive surge USC tried to muster, and three consecutive service aces by the Cougars combined with more errors by USC allowed BYU to advance its lead to 12-6.
Kills by Yoder, Benesh and Jansen punctuated a spree of BYU blocks and kills to bring the score to 18-12. Yoder finally found his groove and added more kills, though it was not enough to stop BYU from taking the second set, 25-18.
Junior outside hitter Cristian Rivera and redshirt junior outside hitter Joey Booth each had a kill to give the Trojans their first lead of the night, taking a 2-1 lead in the third set. Booth had another kill, as did Benesh, and a service ace by Rivera kept the score at eight apiece.
Errors by the Trojans allowed BYU to take a 12-10 lead. USC continued to trail by two until the Cougars took a 20-16 lead. A kill by Benesh was offset by two consecutive blocks by the cougars, who took a 23-17 lead and went on to win the third and final set, 25-17.
Yoder, the MPSF freshman of the year, led the team with 10 kills, while Benesh added six. USC had 20 attack errors to BYU’s four. The Trojans also trailed the cougars in hitting percentage, hitting .211 while BYU hit .519. The Cougars also dominated the Trojans in blocks, outnumbering them 12 to two.
Though the Trojans were surely disappointed with their performance in Provo, they shouldn’t be surprised at the result, as no team has beaten BYU on its home court since February 2013.
USC’s 16-11 record marks a sharp improvement from last season, when the Trojans went a dismal 6-18, but the Trojans still haven’t been able to replicate the success of the 2011-2012 season, in which the team fell in the national championship and ended up with a 26-7 overall record.
Yoder finished the season with a team-leading 4.02 kills per set, while Christenson led the team with 11.62 assists per set. These two also led the team in service aces, with 13 and 25, respectively.
Senior libero Henry Cassiday finished his USC career leading the team in sets played this season, with 100 out of 102.

On Saturday, USC concluded its first spring game under head coach Steve Sarkisian, and the overall results were mixed — the Trojans’ offense was kept out of the end zone all day and had trouble moving the ball, gaining just 257 offensive yards and completing fewer than 50 percent of its passes.
Shooting blanks · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler went 5-for-10 for 86 yards during USC’s spring game, with no touchdowns and no interceptions. Kessler was named the Trojans’ starter last week. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The play calling was conservative, and the overall goal of the day appeared to be less about scoring points and more about generating excitement for the fans and keeping everyone healthy. By those standards, the day was a success.
“I thought our kids played hard,” Sarkisian said. “There were some big passing plays that guys made. Overall the defense played really well, especially in the red zone. The end result is no serious injuries, so all in all we come out of spring just about as healthy as we started.”
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, just days after being officially named the Trojans’ starter, began the game by completing his first two pass attempts and leading the offense down to the 2-yard line. But the defense settled in after that, and Kessler finished the day with five completions on 10 pass attempts for 86 yards.
“We just need to get healthy,” Kessler said. “We moved the ball fine … we had plenty of opportunities, we just didn’t finish in the end zone. Overall, through the spring, our guys did great. We’ve made so many improvements.”
In the first series, the offense had the ball inches away from the goal line on third down and attempted a run play to the left side, but senior linebacker Hayes Pullard anticipated the snap count and seemed to know where the play was going, and made a tackle for a four-yard loss.
“Hayes knew the play,” Kessler said. “He’s a veteran, and you expect that from him. He does that in games, too, when we’re playing other teams, because he’s so smart.”
Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne and the second team offense struggled just as much as the first team. Both offensive lines struggled to keep the defensive front out of the backfield, with the defense making several tackles behind the line of scrimmage. The offense finished the game with 34 rushing yards on 41 attempts, with a long of just 11 yards.
“You’ve got guys like Antwaun Woods, Leonard [Williams] is coming back and J.R. Tavai,” Browne said. “That’s the best defensive line in this conference, and hopefully in the country. It was definitely challenging.”
Pullard was complimentary of the defensive line, calling it the strength of the defense.
“You have to give it to [the defensive line] all the time,” Pullard said. “We need them to stop the run, and we need them to help in pass defense. Without the front seven, we don’t have anything.”
Though Sarkisian and the rest of the coaching staff did not place a large emphasis on the final score, Sarkisian admitted that his offense needed to improve its execution by the time fall camp begins in August, especially in the red zone.
“We’ll be a great red zone offense,” Sarkisian said. “Historically, we’ve been, and wherever I’ve gone, we’ve been really good in the red zone. This was a bit of a vanilla game plan [today], and we just wanted to let the guys play. We had a couple chances, and we couldn’t convert. It’s good that we played good red zone defense today, I’ll look at it like that.”
NUMBERS GAME
Sarkisian caused a minor controversy earlier in the spring when he assigned the No. 55 jersey, worn in the past by legendary USC linebackers such as Willie McGinest, Keith Rivers and Junior Seau, to freshman offensive lineman Toa Lobendahn.
McGinest was on the field for the spring game on Saturday and when asked about the decision to give No. 55 to an offensive lineman, he was honest in saying that he was disappointed with the decision and wanted to have a conversation with Sarkisian about it. After the game, Sarkisian said he intended to change Lobendahn’s jersey number and that the decision to give him No. 55 in the first place was an oversight.
NEWCOMER
Freshman quarterback Jalen Greene completed four passes on 11 attempts for 61 yards in his first spring game, and showed flashes of promise that encouraged Sarkisian about the speedy youngster’s bright future.
“I thought it was impressive for a kid that should still be in high school to go out and just play ball,” Sarkisian said. “He made some really quality throws, had good command of the offense and pulled the ball down and ran some. For a kid who should be getting ready for senior prom, I thought he showed a really good sense of confidence and threw the ball with conviction. I was very encouraged by him.”
QUICK HITS 
Sarkisian said he expects to have a fully healthy roster by the time the team begins fall camp in early August.
Junior tight end Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick led the Trojans with three catches for 56 yards. With redshirt senior tight end Randall Telfer out with an injury, Cope-Fitzpatrick has taken advantage of the extra practice reps and seems poised for a breakout season. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton said earlier in the spring that tight ends will be featured more in the passing game this season.
Senior kicker Andre Heidari made four of his five field goal attempts. Heidari was 15-for-22 last season, and made the game-winner in USC’s upset win over Stanford.
USC ran 85 total plays during the team portion of the day, and the attendance was 17,500.

Throughout my youth, I’ve loved to write. When I was just a kid, it made no difference to me that I still struggled with English. From short stories scribbled in tacky notebooks to poems scrawled onto restaurant napkins, writing was a release for my cluttered mind. My words flowed freely without censorship, and I spilled myself onto paper without a second thought.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
But things changed drastically in high school when I wrote for the school newspaper. I was far more conscious of my thoughts given that they went from private to public, for all to see and criticize.
Looking back, my self-consciousness is a reflection of a greater problem many women face: a fear of simply speaking up.
Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, the mastermind behind world-renowned novel The Alchemist, once said, “I write from my soul. This is the reason that critics don’t hurt me, because it is me. If it was not me, if I was pretending to be someone else, then this could unbalance my world, but I know who I am.”
I’ve learned that it’s important to speak up and express your thoughts without worry. Numerous psychologists and researchers have evaluated the precise reasons why women don’t speak up. The biggest reason of them all, and the most unsurprising one, is fear. Fear holds so many women back each day. Fear of rejection stops women from negotiating a salary raise. Fear stops women from going after their dream careers. Fear stops women from taking risks, from making progress and from achieving personal success.
A 2012 study conducted by researchers at Princeton University and Brigham Young University revealed that women find it difficult to speak up in group settings. In fact, the study found that “women speak less than men when a group collaborates to solve a problem … the time that women spoke was significantly less than their proportional representation — amounting to less than 75 percent of the time that men spoke.”
Whether it is verbally or in writing, by shying away from sharing our words, we risk erasing what could have been inspiring female narratives from our history.
For some women, speaking up is so important they’re willing to risk their lives to make a difference.
Sixteen-year-old activist Malala Yousafzai challenged the Taliban, which banned girls from attending school in her homeland, and paid the price for her words. In 2012, on her way home from school, gunmen brutally attacked her, and she slipped into a coma for 10 days.
Despite the high price she paid for voicing her thoughts, Yousafzai maintains the need for others to speak up. She told Voice of America News, “My message to women and girls all around the world is that they should speak up for their rights. Because when you do not speak up our voices are not heard, but if we want to see a bright future then we must speak.”
Though not all of us have stories as moving as Yousafzai’s, we’ve all got something to share with the world.
The Lean In Foundation, a product of Sheryl Sandberg’s vision to empower others, recognizes this very idea — that all women have unique stories that must be told — and curates dozens of female voices on its website. The organization encourages women to share their personal or professional anecdotes of success, failure and everything in between. From the story of Osi Imeokparia, a product management director from the Bay Area with Nigerian roots, to Alice Bentinck, co-founder of a business venture encouraging female programmers, these voices “can inspire, teach and connect us.” In the case of the Lean In Foundation, these voices remind us to continue speaking up.
I came to the United States as an eager 6-year-old child, with patchy English and a quirky accent. The process of finding myself and expressing my thoughts certainly involved painful moments of realization that I had just used the wrong grammar or mispronounced a word. But each day that I push myself to write and to speak my thoughts, I find myself becoming a more confident individual and a better person.
Admittedly, there are still times when I catch myself pausing at the end of my sentences, pushing the delete key to erase letters from my screen, my thoughts vanishing into cyberspace, my voice stifled by my worst enemy — fear. But then, I think of the words of Paulo Coelho or the works of Sheryl Sandberg, Alice Walker and Toni Morrison — I think of women who overcame their fears and told their stories.

Last week, a 14-year-old Dutch teenager taught the cyber world a valuable lesson when it comes to the dos and don’ts of social media: Never, under any circumstances, tweet fake bomb threats at an airline. Though this lesson would appear obvious to most people, it was one that required the young Twitter user (otherwise known as @QueenDemetriax_, or “Sarah”) to turn herself in and face arrest by Dutch authorities in Rotterdam, according to CNN. Though some have written off the young user’s actions as a misguided prank, even the most harmless of jokes that deal with airline security are simply not funny.
It all began with a tweet. On Sunday, April 13, Sarah sent a tweet to American Airlines reading, “hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.”
The tweet prompted a near-immediate response from American Airlines saying, “Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.”
The remainder of the conversation between “Sarah” and American Airlines progressed from fear (with “Sarah” tweeting “I’m so sorry I’m scared now” and “I’m f—-ing 14 years old, do they think I’m gonna blow up a plane or something. I’m just stupid ok.”) to jubilation (with “Sarah” tweeting “I feel famous omg” and “Okay today was the highlight of my twitter days”), yet the conclusion was ultimately clear: The anonymity of the Internet doesn’t excuse the gravity of situations that involve airline security — not even for misguided kids.
In a day and age in which flight security is of the utmost importance, such pranks cannot and should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Though online threats might appear to be harmless on the surface, they are nonetheless treated with the same seriousness as any other type of threat — as they should be. Some tweets are intended as jokes, but others could very well not be. Unfortunately, stunts like the one “Sarah” pulled are not entirely uncommon.
In 2010, 28-year-old Paul Chambers was charged for “menacing electronic communication” after posting an ill-advised tweet ranting about his cancelled flight in which he said, “Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I’m blowing the airport sky high!!,” according to the Guardian. Though his conviction was eventually thrown out in 2012 on an appeal, the tweet cost him time, money and two jobs.
Though one could make the argument that federal investigations into harmless posts on social media might be an overreaction, the fact of the matter is that the rules that apply to speech and expression and social media are the same that apply to any other sort of public forum. In the same way that one cannot simply yell, “Fire!” in a crowded theater, one cannot presume that they can say whatever they’d like in social media without regard for serious consequences — especially when it comes to issues as serious as public safety and security. Such actions only cause unnecessary panic and waste valuable time and resources that could have otherwise been allocated toward confronting serious threats.
Though “Sarah” has since been charged with posting a false or alarming announcement, a crime under Dutch law, it is yet to be determined what her punishment will be, according to CNN. Whatever her punishment might look like, however, it is safe to say this is one lesson she will never forget.
