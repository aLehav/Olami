A long three-year rebuild finally paid its dividends after USC upset No. 7 Arizona at the Galen Center on Saturday night. The win gave Andy Enfield his first signature win as head coach of the Trojans, while matching last season’s Pac-12 win total at three games.
The Trojans have jumped back into the national picture after half a decade of irrelevance. The way they got there is even more fascinating.
Andy Enfield was hired in 2013 following a surprise Sweet 16 run in the NCAA Tournament with Florida Gulf Coast. The picture was clear: Enfield would help rebuild a program tarnished by NCAA sanctions by bringing his up-tempo, flashy coaching style to Los Angeles, similar to the quick rebrand of the “Lob City” Clippers. Unfortunately for USC, the transition did not work out so well.
In his first year as coach, USC went 11-21 and won just two conference games. Star guard Byron Wesley opted to transfer to Gonzaga instead of sticking around for his last year of eligibility. The Trojans improved slightly in the second year of Enfield’s reign, finishing 12-20 with just three conference wins.
While the Trojans were struggling mightily on the court, Enfield was quietly bringing in the pieces to run his system efficiently. Instead of focusing on one-and-done players, Enfield looked to build his program from the bottom up. His first feat came in getting guard Katin Reinhardt to transfer from UNLV in 2013.  Reinhardt, who is only a junior, had to sit out one season due to NCAA rules, but now currently leads the team in scoring with 12.9 points per game.
Enfield continued his prowess off the court by landing one of the best rookie classes in recent USC history in 2014. Enfield brought in two ESPN 100 recruits in standouts Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart. In McLaughlin, Enfield found his point guard of the future while Stewart brought the athleticism and defense that was missing from the squad. McLaughlin and Stewart had an up and down rookie campaign, but have been key to the Trojans this season.
Enfield finally had a competitive team, but was still lacking the depth and rim protection needed to be competitive in the PAC-12. These issues were addressed with USC’s only two recruits for the 2015 season, freshmen Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu. Boatright’s size and ability to spread the floor has opened up the court for the likes of McLaughlin, Stewart and Reinhardt, while Metu has brought the toughness and defense that has been missing from the Trojan squad.
USC is still a very young team, one of the youngest in the country in fact, but Enfield has recruited a strong foundation for the Trojans to build upon. The Trojans only field one senior, Strahinja Gavrilovic, and only have three juniors on their roster ,who contribute heavily. The underclassmen run the show for USC, which is why the future is so bright.
Most powerhouse schools such as UCLA, Kentucky and Duke focus in on the one-and-done studs like Kevin Love, Anthony Davis and Jahlil Okafor. Those schools constantly have huge roster turnover which can lead to up and down seasons. Kentucky, over the past four years, is a prime example.
The Trojans have rebuilt the exact opposite, looking for highly talented players who fit the system and will stay in school rather than jump to the NBA after one season. In fact, the Trojans have rebuilt like an NBA team, garnering young talent in hopes of turning a corner.
While the Trojans are still very young this season, no player except for the seldom used Gavrilovic is expected to leave the program after this season. That means the core of Jovanovic, Reinhardt, Stewart and McLaughlin will have played more than 63 games together entering next season.
Just like in the NBA, having the ability to build a strong foundation will garner lots of attention. The Trojans already have one ESPN 100 recruit committed for next season and the list should continue to grow as USC knocks off more top rated opponents.
The future of USC basketball has never looked brighter.

With their four-overtime win against the top- ten ranked Arizona Wildcats on Saturday night, the men’s basketball team improves to 14-3 on the season, marking its best start since the 2000-2001 season.
After an initial five-game winning streak, the Trojans fell at the hands of the No. 7 Xavier Musketeers and the deceptive underdog Monmouth Hawks in the AdvoCare Invitational, falling to 5-2 on the year.
Since then, however, USC has won nine of its past 10 games, suffering a two-point loss to Washington on the road before winning both of its home games against Arizona State and Arizona. With the win over Arizona, USC improves its undefeated home record to 11-0 and has garnered national attention.
Despite some injuries and tough road contests against top-ranked Wichita State and Xavier, the Trojans have persevered and are sporting a 3-1 record in conference play, their best since USC’s 2006-2007 campaign.
The first challenge to USC’s rotation was in the form of a broken nose to Jordan McLaughlin which, due to a protective mask, limited his shooting percentage and court vision. After taking the mask off, McLaughlin and the Trojans experienced visible success.
“The first mask was tough … It was a little bit too far off my face, so it messed with my peripheral vision a little bit,” McLaughlin said. “The other day I decided to take it off and I’ve been playing pretty well since taking it off, so hopefully I can continue that.”
Despite his injured nose inhibiting his play, McLaughlin has been key for the Trojans in 2015, averaging 12.9 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.5 steals and 5.2 assists, which are among the highest stats on the team.
One facet of McLaughlin’s play which has hurt the Trojans this season is his 45 turnovers, 14 more than the second-highest player on the roster. And while McLaughlin’s turnovers didn’t necessarily cause either of USC’s losses to Xavier and Monmouth, his eight turnovers were a major factor for USC’s 87-85 loss to Washington on the road.
Discounting his eight-turnover performance against UW, McLaughlin is easily the team’s offensive MVP in 2015, scoring in double digits 11 times and averaging 47.9 percent from the field with a 44.6 shooting percentage from beyond the arc.
Additionally, McLaughlin has been efficient distributing the ball, recording six or more assists in half of his games played this year, including a 16-assist game against Lafayette College on Dec. 23,  which broke Brandon Granville’s record of 15 against Memphis that has stood since Nov. 23, 1999.
On the other side of McLaughlin’s assists, freshmen phenoms Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu have combined for 18.6 points, 2.5 blocked shots and 8.3 rebounds per game.
Metu and Boatwright, both at least 6’10”, have two distinct playing styles, with Metu playing a physical, inside game with a myriad of dunks and rebounds, and Boatwright with more of an outside, shoot-first game with three-pointers aplenty.
This season would not be complete, however, without the step-up play of guards Julian Jacobs and Elijah Stewart.
Jacobs, a double-digit scorer in 12 of his 14 games played this season, has bounced back nicely after missing three games due to an ankle injury, scoring 60 points and accounting for 20 assists and a 57.4 percent shooting percentage over the past four games.
Stewart, a recent overachiever with 80 points and 16 three-pointers in the past five games, has overcome an early season slump. During an eight-game stretch from Nov. 26 to Dec. 21, Stewart connected on just 15 of his 49 shots with just 5.4 points per game.
“I had to go back to the drawing board,” Stewart said. “To work on my form and get my release to be a bit quicker.”
This season, Stewart and the offense have been firing on all cylinders and, with six players averaging in double figures, are averaging 84.3 points per game, the 19th highest in the nation.
With help from three-point snipers Stewart, Reinhardt, Boatwright and McLaughlin, the team is averaging 40.9 percent from downtown, and 12th-best among D-I schools.
On the defensive side of the ball, Southern California has been dominating, ranking first in the nation in blocked shots, thanks to Nikola Jovanovic and Chimezie Metu’s combined 51 shots blocked.
When asked about the NCAA tournament and the AP Poll, in his classic smiling style, head coach Andy Enfield responded, “We’re not concerned about that. There are a lot of good teams in this league and we’re just going to focus on our next one …. We just have to keep getting better and improve. We’re very short minded, very short focused here. We’re not looking into the future.”
After their unprecedented win against the Arizona Wildcats, the Trojans will hit the road to take on UCLA, Oregon and Oregon State before coming back to the Galen Center to play host to Washington State, Washington and UCLA.

After a less-than-stellar defensive performance during the 2015 USC football campaign, the Trojans have a new man at the helm.
Clancy Pendergast, who served as defensive coordinator for USC in 2013, will return to the same role next season.
Pendergast was the linebackers coach for the San Francisco 49ers in 2015. He has spent 16 of his 24 years of coaching experience in the NFL. From 2010 to 2012, Pendergast was the defensive coordinator at Cal and constructed a defense that was among the best in the Pac-12, ranking first in total defense during his first two seasons.
He had similar success with the Trojans, as USC finished in the top 25 nationally in a number of defensive categories, including total and scoring defense.
“We are very excited to announce the return of Clancy Pendergast as our defensive coordinator,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I have had the good fortune to watch Clancy lead our defense first hand, and was blown away by his knowledge of the game as well as his teaching abilities. His success at both the NFL and college level makes it easy to see why he is one of the top defensive coaches in the game today.”
It seemed change was in the air for the entire season.
A wave of uncertainty inundated the program upon Steve Sarkisian’s exit, as Helton took the reins when the Trojans were 3-2 and looking for answers.
Helton’s impressive stint as interim head coach earned the respect of players, fans and members of the athletic department alike. With that said, attention now shifts to the 2016 season, which coincidentally begins with a game against national champion Alabama in Arlington, Texas.
There is a lot to digest as the Trojans turn the page and prepare for spring ball.
Helton went with a coaching overhaul on the defensive side of the ball, opting not to retain defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, defensive line coach Chris Wilson and defensive backs coach Keith Heyward.
The defense made strides as the season progressed, but a trip to Eugene halted that progress. Oregon quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. threw six touchdown passes — and just five incompletions — in a 48-28 rout by the Ducks. Following the loss to Stanford in the Pac-12 title game, Wilcox was dismissed. He did not coach during the Holiday Bowl against Wisconsin.
USC was 65th in the FBS in total defense, allowing almost exactly 400 yards per game.
Special teams got a new coordinator, as John Baxter made his way back to Troy. He was Michigan’s special teams coordinator this past season, but was with the Trojans as recently as 2013.
One of the biggest surprises, though, was tight ends coach Marques Tuiasosopo’s decision to join the UCLA coaching staff as quarterbacks coach. Tuiasosopo joined Sarkisian in the move from Seattle to Los Angeles for the 2014 season. Tuiasosopo also served as the quarterbacks coach at USC during the latter part of the season.
Tuiasosopo was an assistant coach on offense for the Trojans but is now taking his talents across town.
Coaches move on. So do players.
Cody Kessler’s college career has come to a conclusion, as USC prepares to bid a fond farewell to one of the most efficient quarterbacks this conference has ever seen. The redshirt senior finished with more than 10,000 career passing yards. Tre Madden, a Trojan tailback, is also a fifth-year senior and will no longer be spotted in the Trojans’ backfield.
The obvious loss on the defensive side is Su’a Cravens. The junior figures to be a high draft pick this spring, especially given his versatility. He is a monster at both outside linebacker and strong safety and has undoubtedly turned some heads of pro scouts. His impact at the strongside outside linebacker hybrid position was immense game in and game out.
Replacing No. 21 will not be easy.
There will be plenty of storylines to keep tabs on this offseason. The development of quarterback Max Browne will be a hot topic during spring ball, as will the play of freshman sensation Ronald Jones II at tailback.
Inside linebacker Lamar Dawson has wrapped up his career as well, but the youngster Cam Smith showed his brilliance this season and ensured fans that he is more than capable of dominating at the collegiate level. Another spring storyline will be his recovery from an ACL injury he suffered against Colorado.0000000
The postseason loss to Wisconsin was agonizing for the Trojan faithful, but there is a tremendous amount of energy as spring practice approaches.
It goes without saying that the preparation for national champion Alabama in the 2016 opener starts now.

After falling to the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion in their prior matchup, the now No. 25 Women of Troy knew that they needed to perform better in order to defeat their crosstown rival. They did just that in a 71-68 win over No. 15 UCLA at the Galen Center Sunday night.
After a slow first half, the Trojans’ offense performed much better in the second half as they began to pound the ball inside more with Temi Fagbenle, who had a team-high 20 points, and Kristen Simon, who finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds. UCLA had no answer for the two as they attacked the rim much more frequently.
Fagbenle was unstoppable one-on-one as she beat her defender with a variety of moves, including a beautiful spin that extended the Trojan lead to double-digits early in the fourth quarter. Simon used her strength and craftiness to either draw fouls or finish strong at the rim.
With five minutes left and USC holding a 14-point lead following a jumper by Fagbenle, it felt like the game was wrapped up. However, the Bruins came storming back with a run of their own and cut the lead to three when the Bruins’ Kari Korver — cousin of Atlanta Hawks sharpshooter Kyle Korver — hit a three-pointer to narrow the gap to three with eight seconds left on the clock. However, Jordan Adams hit two free throws on the following possession after being intentionally fouled to seal the victory for USC.
“It was our job to give a better effort and be more focused in this game at home, and I think we did that,” coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said.
UCLA came into the game as the tenth highest scoring team in the nation. However, it was held well below its season average as USC used a combination of pesky perimeter defense and exceptional interior defense to limit the Bruins to 31.2 percent shooting from the field — a major improvement from the 49.2 percent in their prior contest at UCLA.
Jordin Canada finished with 26 points and seven assists for the Bruins, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Trojans and Fagbenle, who finished with 20 points, including nine points during a crucial 11-2 run in the fourth quarter. Adams, who did not play in the previous matchup against the Bruins due to injury, finished with 13 points, including six crucial free throws in the final 1:17.
“[Fagbenle] is everything we need her to be whenever we need it,” Cooper-Dyke said. “That’s the type of player she is and that’s the type of player we need to beat good teams like UCLA.”
Both teams struggled offensively in the first half. USC shot 30.3 percent while turning the ball over eight times and UCLA shot 23.7 percent while shooting 55.6 percent at the charity stripe.
This was UCLA’s first loss to an unranked opponent this season.
With the victory, USC is now 14-2 overall and has broken into the top 25 rankings for the first time since 2011. This was its first victory over a ranked opponent in three tries, after losing to Oregon State at home and losing to UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.
The Pac-12 is arguably the toughest conference overall, boasting five teams ranked in the top 25, four teams ranked in the top 15, and only one team with an overall record below .500. If the Women of Troy continue to improve, however, they will be a force to be reckoned with in March.
For her role in the two wins this week, Fagbenle has been named the Pac-12 Player of the Week.

The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams are already ranked nationally and are looking to continue their success in Tuesday’s meet against Wisconsin that will begin at 12:30 p.m. in the Uytengsu Aquatic Center.
The Women of Troy (5-1) are heading into their season ranked No. 4 nationally. They are currently 5-1 and will be facing a No. 16 ranked Wisconsin.
The No. 17 ranked men’s team (5-1) will also face stiff competition in a Wisconsin squad that is ranked No. 15. Both Wisconsin teams are 2-1 overall but competed against the Trojans in last month’s Texas Invitational. USC will be facing Wisconsin for the fifth year in a row.
The Women of Troy have been undefeated against Wisconsin in the past five years, and the men are 3-1 after Wisconsin handed them their first loss of the season a year ago.
The men’s team won their first conference title since 1979 last season finishing with a record of 6-2 overall and 4-1 in conference meets. The women’s team finished third in the Pac-12 but had a strong showing at the NCAA championship, finishing eighth. The Women of Troy are one of only four schools to finish in the top eight of the NCAA in each of the last six years.
The men’s team will return four All-Americans and the women will return five All-Americans led by captain Kendyl Stewart.
The Women of Troy are already heating up the national rankings in specific events as well, having met ‘A’ time qualifications for the 200y, 400y and 800y free relays as well as the 400y medley relay.
Junior Chelsea Chenault is leading USC in three events: the 200y and 500y free and the 200y fly. Her times in these events are also on the national board in the ‘B’ range. Her other ‘B’ time comes in the 100y free.
The men are led by junior Reed Malone who owns a ‘B’ time in both the 200y and 500y free.
Both teams are led by head coach Dave Salo who is entering his tenth season as the head of the swimming program. Salo has over 30 years of collegiate, club and national coaching experience and was elected into the American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2010.
The diving team is led by coach Hongping Li who is in his 17th season at the helm of the USC program. Li himself is an NCAA champion and two-time Olympian but has seen significant success coaching as well. Li has twice been named NCAA Coach of the Year and has received Pac-12 Women’s Coach of the Year 11 times.
Both teams will compete in the Bruin Diving Invitational over the weekend before starting off Pac-12 competition with swim and dive meets against Cal on Jan. 29 for the women and Feb. 5 for the men.

No one wants to spend New Year’s Eve acting as a designated driver. Even fewer would choose to drive around a slew of inebriated strangers. Realizing that standardized wages would not incentivize many drivers to forgo an evening of partying in favor of working, Uber designed a price model to heavily reward the drivers who choose to turn out and work during high-demand nights instead of electing to turn up.
Hannah Luk | Daily Trojan
Naturally, densely populated cities saw explosive demand for Uber rides throughout the night and early morning hours following New Year’s Eve, with surge pricing reaching nine times the normal rate in Miami Beach and nearly seven times the normal rate in Philadelphia. Despite multiple warnings from Uber on its blog and fare estimator, as well as plenty of independent web coverage providing tips on how to avoid steep bills, numerous people still took to social media the next morning to complain that the prices were “insanity” and “egregious.” The complaints generally bemoaned the fact that it took, in some cases, up to $200 to get a safe ride home. These complaints indicate that some would prefer that the government step in and ban the “insanity” of high prices. However, this insinuation is the true insanity.
First, consumers were free to get a car from one of Uber’s many competitors, such as Lyft or SideCar, take public transit or even hail a regular yellow cab.
A hypothetical consumer might say, “But there were only Ubers available!” Well, of course. Ubers were the only cars available in many instances. The Uber price model is designed with the specific purpose of bringing out drivers during nights when demand dramatically increases, such as New Year’s Eve and Halloween. No driver would work during such celebratory nights if it was not worth their time.
The government could hypothetically ban surge pricing, but it could not force Uber or cab drivers to come out and work. Presumably, many Americans would pay a higher price to make it home safely, instead of electing to be left out in the cold or, worse, wind up with a DUI.
Finally, massive Uber bills are the exception, not the rule. According to Uber statistics from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. of this past New Year’s Eve, only 16 percent of American Uber rides had surge pricing of more than three times the normal rate, and 60 percent of American Uber rides had no surge pricing at all. Considering that the worldwide demand for Uber rides increased nearly threefold from midnight to 12:30 a.m., one can infer that surge pricing was overwhelmingly successful in its attempt to bring out drivers and keep prices as low as possible.
If, in the future, Uber’s surge pricing is found to be ineffective or fraudulent, we as consumers can exercise our greatest power in the market economy and use Uber’s competitors instead. Additionally, what governments can feasibly and fairly do is work with public transit systems, as Los Angeles and Chicago did this past New Year’s Eve, to offer free rides or extended hours on nights with a high demand for safe rides home. The government should have an obligation to increase competition, but certainly not to hinder it.
Waking up hungover with a hefty Uber bill is not a failing of capitalism; it is the system properly at work, ensuring that market supply can adequately meet consumer demand.

Some Uber users rang in the new year with a surprise in their bank statements — the worst of which totaled more than $1,000 in charges. The pricey Uber rides came as a result of what regular users know as “surge pricing,” during which time Uber increases prices to meet a heightened demand — a decision the company claims incentivizes more drivers.
But these $1,000-plus New Year’s Eve charges were well outside of the norm. Whereas most Uber users are familiar with the occasional surge prices ranging from two to three times the normal rate, New Year’s Eve passengers saw prices go as high as nine times the usual amount. Though Uber excused its surge pricing as a result of supply and demand, this defense fails to address Uber’s sordid history of price-gouging — particularly when customers’ safety should be the first priority.
“Higher prices are required in order to get cars on the road and keep them on the road during the busiest times,” Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in response to complaints. “In short, without surge pricing, there would be no car available at all.”
But hiking up prices on New Year’s Eve doesn’t send a message of supply and demand. Rather, it implies that Uber, as a company committed to increasing accessibility, is merely taking advantage of its users on a night in which getting home safely and affordably is paramount.
This wouldn’t be the first time Uber has crossed the line with its surge pricing. In 2014, the company faced humiliating backlash after it charged users up to four times more in Sydney, Australia, following a hostage crisis. Those seeking to distance themselves from the downtown siege were faced with a minimum $100 charge — a fare hike Uber said it implemented with the crisis in mind in order to “encourage more drivers to come online and pick up passengers in the area,” according to the company’s Twitter page.
But taking advantage of customers in situations that warrant heightened safety isn’t only immoral — it’s bad business. Though heightened prices might compel more drivers to work in the short-term, there’s no guarantee that such practices can maintain customer loyalty in the long-term. In fact, a 2015 study by Northeastern University found that surge pricing doesn’t always work in Uber’s favor, prompting would-be customers to either wait until the surge expires or make alternative travel plans. This also does no favors to Uber drivers, especially those who prefer to rely on a steady rate to make a living instead of simply chasing the occasional surge from city to city.
Though there are government-led initiatives to cap excessive surge pricing — an especially necessary move during emergency situations or natural disasters — Uber can and must take action to benefit its employees and customers alike. The company should implement an automatic fare estimate for all rides — a feature that, although it already exists within the app, could be more easily accessible. The app could also do more to expand Uber Pool, a feature that allows users to split rides with others going in the same direction.
But perhaps the simplest solution to this issue would be for Uber to get rid of its surge pricing tactics altogether. By moderately increasing the normal rate across the board, Uber can give its drivers the peace of mind to rely on a steady rate without chasing occasional surges and can also maintain customer trust — particularly during times when consumers need the service most.
Regardless of other forms of transportation that users can rely on, Uber has a responsibility to provide a fair and trustworthy service to its customers without fear of price-gouging or being taken advantage of in a dangerous situation. Unless Uber is ready to put the needs of its valued customers first, perhaps it’s time we find another Lyft.

A Princeton study (not paid for by Uber) calculated that a mere 12.4% rate increase is sufficient to bring supply in line with demand, NOT 300%-500%-900%!!!

Rachel Atherly | Daily Trojan
A little over a week ago, the son of an internationally-known radical racist with a history of threatening his government led an armed group to take over a government building. As we speak, the group is holed up, threatening violence should lawful authorities attempt to retake the building. One member of the group ominously said, “nobody wants anything bad to happen on any side,” but it seems that that is exactly what will happen if the police become involved. Their leader has a set of demands, and his followers will not give in until their demands are met. “We’re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,” stated the man. “This is not a decision we’ve made at the last minute.”
Is this group ISIS? No. The IRA? Try again. The FARC? Not even close.
Media organizations who do not recognize this is an act of terrorism are lying to themselves, fooling their audience and creating division when America most needs unity. This group had not made headlines until the weekend, but they are certainly a terrorist organization, as much as any of the three listed above.
Led by Ammon Bundy, the son of notorious rancher Cliven Bundy, the militia took control of the Malhuer National Wildlife Refuge headquarters building in rural Burns, Oregon. The group, reported to contain up to 100 armed men, broke into and occupied the building, demanding the federal government reduce grazing fees on federal lands.
Of course, the ranchers are already grazing their herds at a 93 percent discount.
This group of misguided ranchers and their armed supporters have illegally taken up arms against the United States. Although they have not shot anyone — yet — their armed occupation of a federal building is an express threat to any person or entity that stands in their way. They have a political mission — to reduce the already absurdly low grazing fees — and they are using violence to coerce the government and to intimidate the local population.
Their actions meet the definition of domestic terrorism. According to the FBI’s definition of domestic terrorism:
“Domestic terrorism” means activities with the following three characteristics:
• Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
• Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination. or kidnapping; and
• Occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.
Bundy’s group meets all three requirements. Therefore, the takeover in Oregon meets the standards for terrorism.
Because this is terrorism, it is important that we recognize it as such. USC Professor Jeffrey Fields, who teaches classes on terrorism and American foreign policy as the Director of the Dornsife in D.C. program, has long observed a disparity in American media portrayal of different groups who commit violence.
“The U.S. has essentially decided that terrorism now means violent acts perpetrated by foreigners, specifically Muslims, Arabs or Middle Easterners,” Fields said. Even when events fit all the criteria of terrorism, such as those laid out in the U.S. Code, if the perpetrator is white, Field says “the media is reluctant to characterize the event as terrorism.” This became glaringly obvious to Fields after the attack this summer in Charleston, South Carolina, where Dylann Roof, a white man, shot ten black worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Church, killing nine. Roof, who shouted that he wanted to start a race war during the killing spree, was not characterized as a terrorist in many American media outlets.
There is a danger when the media fails to recognize terrorism when it occurs. If terrorism only happens when certain groups are to blame, Fields said, “it creates harm by stigmatizing certain groups. Terrorism is an inflammatory word.” Isolated groups, in turn, are less likely to cooperate with the rest of society.
Groups turn to terrorism when they have no ability to cooperate with others and cannot change policy through legitimate means. Groups that cannot advocate through the free press, at public demonstrations, through elected officials or at the ballot box turn to terrorism as a last resort. They use violence to coerce governments and scare civilians until they get what they want. In the past, the tactic has worked, but the use of this tactic is highly illegal for good reason. Terrorism is an extreme reaction to adverse circumstances.
This is not the time to parse the definition of terrorism and mitigate the seriousness of the extremism in Oregon. Any other group besides the white men in occupying the wildlife refuge would be by now unanimously declared terrorists. It’s time to call this terrorism for what it is and take appropriate steps to detain, try and convict these American extremists.
As far as I’m willing to go is to say if they aren’t terrorising people any definition that calls them terrorists is an unacceptable definition.
I live in the state and I can tell you nobody here is terrorised. They don’t even care.
They doesn’t mean they’re not terrorists, they’re just bad terrorists..  at some point they’ll get tired of being ignored and they’ll step over the line far enough to hurt someone.. will it be terrorist enough for you then?

As a senior unwillingly graduating this May, I inevitably find myself reflecting on the past three and a half years. I am amazed by how much has changed during that time and by how much has not. Since I arrived at USC in 2012, the acceptance rate for freshmen has fallen nearly 10 percent, new buildings have sprouted up on campus and an entire Village was razed and now nearly rebuilt. Still, every fall, the Trojan faithful head to the Coliseum to cheer on the Men of Troy as the Spirit of Troy plays “Conquest!” and “Tribute to Troy” again, and again, and again. The Trojan Knights continue to guard Tommy Trojan in the week preceding the game against that school in Westwood and the Daily Trojan continues to go to press.
This contrast between tradition and progress is characteristic of USC which, as President C. L. Max Nikias likes to say, is “going to run a marathon at a sprinter’s pace.” The University has made huge leaps in the field of higher education — a massive fundraising campaign which has raised $4.7 billion to date, a groundbreaking Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience and a Nobel prize in chemistry for Professor Arieh Warshel — to name a few. But this relentless pace is far from perfect, as evidenced by concerns over diversity and inclusion, which Provost Michael Quick has called one of the “wicked problems” of our time, and efforts by faculty to unionize for higher wages and better benefits.
The Daily Trojan is also a dichotomy of tradition and progress. We have a storied print history dating back to 1912, but we have also made efforts to adjust to the forces disrupting the larger print media industry by expanding our online and digital presence. This semester we will continue to adapt to the changing media environment by creating more digital content for our website and social media platforms to tell stories in the most engaging way possible and create a rich platform for discussion for USC and the community around it.
But we will not ignore tradition. In addition to expanding our digital coverage, we will also be providing you with more longform, in-depth stories that examine our University, the progress it has made and the issues that still need to be addressed. Our goal is to become a 21st-century student media organization that acknowledges USC’s triumphs while still holding it accountable to its students and to continue our tradition of print excellence as we strive to be a pioneer in the field of collegiate journalism.

As the semester begins and hundreds of students return from alternative winter breaks from every corner of the world, it is evident that “service learning” trips by college students have become the latest example of the thriving industry of volunteer tourism, or “voluntourism.” While programs like USC’s Alternative Breaks send students abroad for one to three weeks for charity work, the efficacy and legitimacy of service learning programs is dubious at best. More often than not service trips do little to mitigate poverty; instead, they work to glorify the volunteers themselves while bolstering the Western savior narrative.
But the social impact of such volunteer trips arguably last as long as the two weeks spent instituting them, rendering them futile. The cost of these programs, starting at about $650, covers living and travel expenses of volunteers, not the population they serve. Instead, donating that money to a local grassroots organization that would empower members of the community to institute relief efforts would not only pool more resources but also allows locals to have a stake in their own community. Rather than to commodify already exploited and impoverished people, students should consider the importance of sustainable change because promoting a cycle of dependency can be regressive to these communities, as seen in volunteer-based orphanage work.
UNICEF and Friends International launched a campaign in October 2011 to stop orphanage tourism in Cambodia. Volunteership inadvertently has created a capricious industry where families sell their children to orphanages to mitigate the strains of desperate poverty. The campaign contends that orphanage tourism exploits and endangers children because it lacks necessary safety measures dedicated to the physical and mental well-being of children. The demand from Westerners to volunteer in Cambodian orphanages actually exacerbates the situation, creating a fertile breeding ground for child trafficking.
While voluntourism certainly tarnishes the merit of humanitarian work, it is important to note the impact of effective, long-term and personal aid programs that can be facilitated by both skilled and unskilled volunteers. In case of the Syrian refugee crisis, skilled volunteers who are learned in a craft, language or sport play a critical role in restoring quality of life to children in abeyance. Perhaps the greatest harm of the crisis is the “lost generation” of Syrian children whose development, education and security were interrupted by civil war. Skilled volunteers providing personal aid aim to either return children to their homes in Syria or resettle them elsewhere until they have the skillsets necessary to pursue higher education or to enter the workplace. Personal aid is instrumental to counter the detrimental effects of psychological trauma as well. Unskilled volunteers have a place in the humanitarian world as well; if students truly care about service work, then their selfless and uncompromising dedication to these populations should work in the form of social media campaigning, fundraising and facilitating personal aid programs.
Short and ineffective service learning trips degrade the potential of communities in developing nations and they perpetuate a sense of helplessness and a system of reliance. Students should reconsider the validity of short-term volunteer programs, as they effectively render tragedy into tourism.
