Growing up, Dominic Jocas’ parents instilled in him a great sense of solidarity for others. When he came to USC, his qualities as an avid explorer translated to going into South Central and Skid Row, interacting with communities outside of the USC bubble.
One of the first things Jocas, a freshman majoring in anthropology, noticed was the negative perception other students have about USC’s neighboring communities, namely unhoused individuals. This, combined with having a lot of leftover meal swipes each week, made him start handing out extra food from University dining establishments to those in need.
“As Americans, we’re conditioned to completely block off homeless people from our entire mindset, and every time we see one, we’re taught to pretend they don’t even exist,” Jocas said. “That’s a dehumanizing way to look at someone who has nothing. A lot of times, all they want is just company and someone to talk with them and someone that actually cares.”
However, Jocas soon realized that while he wanted to find a way to help more, he did not have the resources to do it on his own. He also noticed that students tend to have a lot of unused belongings, such as clothes and shoes. 
Launched Jan. 13, Jocas created AyuDirect to accomplish three main goals: make material distribution as quick as possible, create a sustainable way of helping those in need and merge the communities of USC, South Central and University Park. Jocas wanted to create a program resembling Uber, where a person puts in a request for an item and then someone in the area who can fulfill the request is matched with them.
“We need to find a way to get our students to see themselves as South Central residents and not as just USC students and get them [to be] a part of the community,” Jocas said. 
Other apps also locate resources, such as food pantries, around Los Angeles, but unhoused individuals do not have access to phones or reliable internet connection. AyuDirect differs from other programs because their approach focuses on walking around the area and asking people what they need directly, Jocas said.
Since September, Jocas has distributed around 1,000 meals and fulfilled around 15 AyuDirect requests. However, the program, which is currently run on Instagram, depends heavily on having a large follower base who can see requests and fulfill them, Jocas said. He hopes to launch a dedicated app by the beginning of next semester. 
“We’ve only had a few requests because I don’t have the follower base yet to be fulfilling requests daily like I want to, but overall it’s been nothing but support and a lot of people cheering me on,” Jocas said.
Jocas has not been alone in his endeavor. Lisa Derinsicky, a community leader who met Jocas when he made a donation to the community fridge, has helped Jocas connect with South Central. Derinsicky, whose main goals for the community are unity and collaboration, said she loves when students visit and find ways to help. While she recognizes the stigma around the South Central area, she attributes it to the fear of the unknown and encourages students to get to know the community.
“Take the first step and come and see for yourself,” Derinsicky said. “I’m pretty sure that many [students] will have a change of heart, as many of them have.”
While AyuDirect grows enough to have a constant flow of requests and people fulfilling them, Jocas focuses on distributing food in the meantime. To aid with food distribution, AyuDirect hosted a cookout April 2. The cookout also served as a way for the project to gain more publicity.
“I don’t have enough words to describe [the cookout]. It was awesome,” Derinsicky said. “When you see happy people with a satisfied stomach and a big happy face because they are so content and satisfied to mingle and get acquainted with old friends and make new friends, that is awesome. There’s no price on that.”
Dat Nguyen, a freshman majoring in psychology, helps Jocas with the project whenever he can. Similarly to Jocas, his mother taught him to help others anytime he could from a young age. He wishes other students understood the privilege they hold.
“We’re in this bubble at USC, but when you go further or you go downtown, you don’t realize how bad it is,” Nguyen said. “We have issues with gentrification, which will cause more displaced families and more displaced homes. People don’t understand the effects that the school has and I’m concerned we are not doing a lot to help.”
Jocas urges students to follow the AyuDirect Instagram page and turn on the post notifications so that they know when requests are made and help spread the word. He also asks students to be more compassionate towards those less fortunate than them.
“Don’t be so quick to judge people, take the time to hear people’s stories,” Jocas said.

The Undergraduate Student Government held its first official meeting with the 142nd senate Tuesday. 
At the emergency senate meeting last Thursday, USG unanimously passed a senate resolution to urge the University administration to extend the Pass/No Pass deadline. 
However, at Tuesday’s meeting, USG president Hannah Woodworth read a response from Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski.
“We have decided that, after pushback, that we will not be changing the Pass/No Pass deadline and instead to connect with your faculty and academic advisors, to discuss any concerns with your coursework,” Woodworth said, reading the response.
Senator Victor Ye, who originally presented the resolution and acted as a key catalyst for its presentation at last Thursday’s emergency senate meeting, said that, despite the University’s denial of the request for a Pass/No Pass extension, the effort put forward by the senators is a testament to the collective action possible within USG.
“With only a few days’ worth of work, we were able to circulate the news across the campus and continue efforts to organize as a grassroots campaign,” Ye said. I hope that more students find agency in working together and collaborating with [USG] on proposals or resolutions to push forward the interests of the general student body.”
At last week’s meeting, Woodworth and vice president Nivea Krishnan announced their new chief programming officer candidate, Jillian Fallon, a junior majoring in political science and public relations. On Tuesday, they explained the process of selecting Fallon as the CPO candidate, citing experience as the most important factor. 
“Programming is a huge part and the biggest part of USG,” Krishnan said. “When we’re looking at a CPO appointment, we really need to take into account what the people in programming say, and [Fallon] received a recommendation from everyone in programming, including the outgoing CPO.”
The senate unanimously approved the appointment of Fallon as the new CPO.  
“As CPO, I will create a productive workspace for committees and assemblies to work together,” Fallon said. “By building a strong foundation within programming, we will be better equipped to work with other branches of USG.”
Senator Yoav Gillath also announced that Trojans Give Back, a student-run group dedicated to eliminating the waste of meal swipes and turning unused swipes into food to donate to local food banks, will expand to include sandwich donations for leftover meal swipes in front of Seeds Marketplace beginning Friday. The group also hopes to allow students to donate dining dollars in exchange for food at the end of the semester. 
Senator Aidan Feighery also advertised the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly’s Night Market, which will be held Thursday in McCarthy Quad. 
Feighery also introduced a senate resolution calling for a stronger University response to posts made during Lunar New Year in February, where a student’s Instagram takeover to illustrate the diversity and nuance of Asian cultures resulted in backlash from community members who believed the statements made invalidated their own Chinese New Year celebration. The resolution looks to recall attention to this issue and ask for a formal apology from the University. 
“As I was running for senate, I presented to the Chinese Students & Scholars Association, and their first question was about how I would deal with the Lunar New Year incident going forward because they had not received a satisfactory response from the administration,” said Feighery in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
This resolution will be debated and voted on at next week’s meeting.

Coronavirus case numbers are not decreasing as significantly as anticipated, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Tuesday. Last week, there were 259 positive coronavirus cases, compared to 320 positive cases the week before.
“Where we are right now is we are not seeing the cases increase exponentially, but we are seeing a continued level of elevated cases,” Van Orman said. “That’s really what we’re concerned about right now.”
According to most recent data from the USC COVID-19 Dasboard,  students occupied 116 spaces for quarantine purposes, but Van Orman said there is still “plenty of capacity” available.
Currently, there have occurred multiple coronavirus “clusters” across campus in particular programs and residential colleges, Van Orman said. USC Student Health notified particular students who are likely to be exposed and requested they test twice a week for the next two weeks to prevent case numbers from increasing further. 
Additionally, with Coachella, Easter, Passover and Ramadan happening this weekend, many students will travel away from campus to celebrate, Van Orman said. 
Student Health sent out an email Tuesday encouraging those who plan on traveling to get tested before and after their trip. Antigen test kits will be available at testing sites for students to pick them up and take on their trip prior to returning to campus. Students traveling to see relatives who may be at higher risk of infection and serious illness are also encouraged to test.
“If you’re coming back from travel, please test. If you have symptoms, please test. If you’re exposed, please test,” Van Orman said. “The antigen tests are another tool we want to make available.” 
More than 90% of coronavirus cases on campus are of the BA.2 variant, which is consistent with Los Angeles County data. BA.2, a more infectious variant than the BA.1 variant, has seen an increase in cases within certain parts of the country, Van Orman said.
“Even within L.A. County, we’ve seen about a 25% increase in the last two weeks,” she said. 
Currently, hospitalizations and deaths are not increasing in L.A. County. These numbers would need to go up for there to be a reinstatement of masking policies, Van Orman said. 
“What we don’t know right now is: ‘Is this BA.2 going to cause a small increase in cases that can still be managed? Or is it going to be an exponential increase, like we saw over the winter?’” Van Orman said.
There are currently no plans to reinstate masking mandates within L.A. County or at USC, according to Van Orman. It is possible, however, that coronavirus clusters on campus will be asked to test and wear masks in particular areas to prevent student case numbers increasing further. 
Similarly, there are no plans to reinstate Trojan Check for this semester. However, physical infrastructure will remain up in case it does need to be reinstated at any time.
Student Health still recommends all USC community members wear masks. People who are at high risk or want to further protect themselves are encouraged to use an N-95 mask. It is important that any student who wants to wear a mask feels comfortable doing so, Van Orman said. 
“We are trying really hard at USC to keep student case numbers down, because we know they contribute not only to that health and safety concerns on campus, but the overall county, and that’s why we’re asking students particularly if they’re going to be traveling to test,” Van Orman said.

Following their biggest recorded win in the last 30 years at the Texas Open, the Trojan Debate Squad went on to the National Debate Tournament, held April 8 to 10, where they made it to the semifinals — the farthest USC has gone in 40 years. 
Partners Julian Kuffour and Kevin Sun were seeded sixth at the Texas Open, a national debate tournament hosted by the University of Texas at Austin, and beat out the number one seeded team — the University of Michigan. The team’s “white whale” at the National Debate Tournament was Northwestern University, the number two ranked team in the country, who they had yet to win a debate against, but defeated at the tournament. 
“Being that late in the [Texas Open], and then when we won the tournament, it’s just all the emotion that you’ve really put into debate for, like, eight years comes out,” said Kuffour, a senior majoring in law, history and culture. 
The duo invested a great deal of time into collegiate debating and to win a tournament in its final season together was an accomplishment for both of them. 
“When people win tournaments, they’re just extremely regal,” Kuffour said. “Me and Kevin jumped out of our seats, screaming and cursing.”
Sean Kennedy, director of debate and forensics, said he saw the team grow significantly over their years together. 
“By the time they finished their last debate at the National Debate Tournament, it was just amazing to see they thought they could go into any debate against anybody and win,” Kennedy said. “That, to me, was the biggest improvement — that they just started to realize how talented they were, and to believe in themselves.”
Sun, a junior majoring in computational linguistics and computer science, and Kuffour have been debate partners since Sun was a freshman.
“When I first came, we were doing these little meetings, and we did a couple practices together, and I thought it would be really cool to do it with Julian,” Sun said. “The rest is history.”
Each year, the debate’s topic is decided in July. The team spent the next seven months researching this year’s topic, antitrust policy, and debating it against teams across the country.
“At every tournament, people introduce new arguments and angles, and we have to evolve literature to answer those new approaches,” Sun said.
Sun and Kuffour find ways to practice nearly everyday. They spend time conducting independent research before texting and calling about their arguments or findings to strengthen their skills, Kuffour said.
“We try to inject a little bit of fun into them, never taking ourselves too seriously, but also, [Kuffour] keeps me on my feet all the time,” Sun said.
The Texas Open was one of their biggest competitions of the season. Going into the tournament, the team “knew they were good.” Getting to the final round required the team to debate in 11 rounds prior. With each round taking nearly two hours, the team debated for 22 hours that weekend. 
The Trojan Debate Squad has not won a tournament since at least the 1990s, though some records show that the latest win dates back to the 1970s. In either case, the Texas Open victory and success at the National Debate Tournament were “long-awaited,” Sun said.
Sun credits the organization of the team, the finding of his partner and the success of their arguments to Kennedy and his support.
Kennedy, who joined the team in 2020, said he was drawn to USC’s strong debate traditions. Kennedy helps manage everything from practice to travel and works closely with Jazmine Pickens, an assistant coach who worked extensively with Sun and Kuffour and always went “above and beyond,” Kennedy said.
Moving forward, Kennedy said he hopes Sun and Kuffour’s success inspires the team’s underclassmen.
“We have a lot of younger debaters who are super talented on our team, but … they often do not have confidence in themselves, and they do not appreciate their own talent,” Kennedy said. “What I’m hoping that this can do is show our younger debaters: ‘You can do this too.’”

Maya Sabbaghian felt restless after attending online classes from her home in Irvine. 
Sabbaghian, a sophomore majoring in business administration, channeled her boredom into securing an internship, sending LinkedIn direct messages to the Forbes 30 under 30 Class of 2020. 
“It wasn’t just about keeping busy,” Sabbaghian said. “It was … doing something that I see a future with and I’m learning something with.” 
One of the people that Sabbaghian reached out to was then-22-year-old Jacob Pace, the former CEO and founder of Flighthouse, one of the largest entertainment brands on TikTok. 
Flighthouse attracted a lot of media attention at the time for driving the virality of multiple TikTok hits such as “Roxanne” by Arizona Zervas. A subsidiary of Create Music Group, the media company designates records with viral potential, then packages and promotes them with various influencers, such as Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae. 
“Within a day, he got back to me to hop on a call,” Sabbaghian said. “So we started talking, and he offered me an internship on the spot.” 
Sabbaghian’s extreme entrepreneurial streak impressed Pace, particularly how Sabbaghian secured her rent to live in Los Angeles by managing jewelry businesses’ social media. 
“I needed a way to make money because I didn’t want to ask my parents for that when it wasn’t necessary to move out here,” Sabbaghian said. “So I just started hitting up hundreds of jewelry businesses on Instagram asking them to do their social media, and two of them said yes, and that covered my whole rent.” 
At the start of her internship, Pace took Sabbaghian under his wing to mentor her and immediately “threw her in.” 
“He took me around everywhere to meet all these people in the industry … it was something I never had exposure to before, or any experience with,” Sabbaghian said. “I guess that just didn’t matter, because, more than anything, he took a chance on my work ethic and that’s something that’s been a theme throughout my experience over the last year.”
Now Sabbaghian is the head of content licensing at Flighthouse, a division she founded herself.
The division generates over 130 million topsnap views per month at $9-$16 average CPMs —  dollars per thousand views. 
“She came in as an intern and built a whole division that’s driving a big chunk of our revenue in less than a year,” said Ash Stahl, Flighthouse’s current CEO. “She just took it upon herself to… find a way to make herself valuable to the company, and I would trust her with absolutely anything.” 
Sabbaghian’s age may be shocking in a corporate environment, but it’s not an anomaly at Flighthouse. In fact, the average age of employees in Sabbaghian’s division is around 20 years old.
“There’s this company ethos of taking a chance on young, passionate, hard working people, and that’s paid off more than anything,” Sabbaghian said. 
While Flighthouse Main develops unique short-form content on TikTok, where influencers participate in skits, interviews and game shows, Sabbaghian’s division primarily syndicates content from YouTube creators to Snapchat Discover. 
“At some point during the internship, we discovered this business model that allows us to generate passive revenue for creators by repackaging their content from one platform to another,” Sabbaghian said. “So we started with the first one, Psych2Go, and in the first month, they blew up and made a lot of revenue off of four videos.”
Sabbaghian saw the potential in the scalability of the business model and immediately knew she wanted to not only be a part of the project, but lead it. 
“I told them … I wanted to own this project, and I wanted to be here and build this division,” Sabbbaghian said. “That was when I was hired full time … and then, the next month after, Psych2Go generated seven times the original revenue, revenue off of four more videos.” 
Sabbaghian’s ambition to further her career at Flighthouse, however, was riddled with doubt. She knew she wanted to stay in school, but juggling her schoolwork with a full-time job and making time for her social life seemed extremely daunting. 
She reached out to her professor and mentor, professor of entrepreneurship, Michael Napoliello, as she transitioned from her role as a digital content intern to an executive position. 
“I remember him distinctly saying, ‘I hate the word ‘balance’ because there is no balance in life. Just get in, get your hands dirty and do it instead of letting fear stop you,’” Sabbaghian said. “He was the one person that I think more than anyone, really unlocked this belief that I could do it.” 
Napoliello had been struck by Sabbaghian’s extreme potential from the moment she enrolled in his class; Sabbaghian had convinced him to let her in despite the fact that she would be the only freshman in the room. 
“That level of ambition stood out for me, the willingness to take a leap,” Napoliello said. “She said, ‘I know I’m not quite qualified but I’m willing to risk it, if that’s okay with you.’ And my response was, ‘People who are willing to take risks are always inspiring.” 
Sabbaghian ultimately decided to take the offer in the end. Now she leads a team of 15 people dig into the analytics of the channels to develop a content strategy based on what’s performing well. They scour YouTube for creators who have the potential to succeed on Snapchat as a secondary platform. 
Her clients have never doubted the executive despite her youth, but she recognizes and acknowledges the apprehension others might feel. However, Sabbaghian feels that her age actually makes her a more effective voice. 
“We’re all young, we’re all learning, but we’re legitimate and we’re making actual revenue for these creators … making a difference in their lives, and the lives of the people who watch it too,” Sabbaghian said. “Never use your age as an excuse for why you can’t do something awesome.”
Correction: In a previous version of this article, we incorrectly referred to Jacob Pace as the “CEO and founder of Flighthouse.” Pace is the former CEO and founder of Flighthouse. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Kazan Taiko reemerged Sunday for a performance met with enthusiasm that mirrored their passionate drums onstage. Kazan, USC’s only taiko drumming ensemble, finally held its 11th annual Spring Showcase, after two years of the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the tradition.
The student group engaged in an approximately 90-minute long performance in the TCC Ballroom, with pounding drums where the crew literally had to carry the performance. 
Between each of the 10 sets, performers moved the taiko drums in unique formations, making each piece particularly engaging in a different way. 
“Dokokara” featured the performers and drums upright in a line, where audiences could hear and see the main rhythm transferred to different drummers. “Hyperdrive” had the drummers sitting on the floor with their torsos halfway up while drumming, an established form of playing from Japan.
Each drummer also made elegant and swift flourishes with their drumsticks, which paired alongside mood lighting and fog, made for delightfully energetic engagement. The performance of “Rising Dragon Fist,” inspired by martial arts, featured drummers divided into halves of the stage bathed in red or blue, reminiscent of the similar setups of games such as “Street Fighter.” Sometimes, drumming was also accompanied by many smaller percussion instruments, including shakers or light choreography. 
No matter whether they were thundering or cheery, however, each performance ended with a satisfying double note, followed by enthusiastic applause and cheers from an audience of friends and family.
As a post-pandemic concert, the club had to revisit old songs and performances to accommodate for two years of missed showcases. This also included inviting recently graduated alumni of the organization  to return to perform for the showcase, with some leaving work from Las Vegas and Portland, Ore., to participate. Several performances featured combinations of alumni and current members, with the efforts summarized during the finale piece, “Kazan Matsuri,” a unique take on a taiko group staple. 
“[Kazan Matsuri] was composed, and then in our archive, and we had to dig it up and figure out how to play it from piecing together old videos and what old alumni had to say about it,” said Helena Lu, Kazan’s media director and a junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures. “The fact that we were able to play it at all, it was just such a gratifying experience, I think, for everybody.”
Prior to the concert, Kazan encountered many unexpected obstacles that furthered problems already encountered by the club’s return to in-person. While the club usually practiced on USC’s Parking Structure A at night, after receiving a cease-and-desist for noise complaints, they had to scramble to find a new practice location. Fortunately, musicology professor Scott Spencer lended rehearsal space and his office to store the drums, which were previously stored at the Senshin Buddhist Temple. 
“It’s sad that a group as old as ours, who USC brings out as [Asian Pacific Islander Desi American] representation in their official events, gets constantly chased off campus by DPS and turned down every time we try to find storage space on campus for our drums,” Lu said. “Carting heavy drums and stands from off campus twice a week always takes a big toll on our members as well.”
The club also experienced difficulties with maintaining consistent membership during the  coronavirus-induced pause of in-person school. The anxieties felt by the club were furthered by the disbandment of Haneulsori, USC’s traditional Korean drum and instrumental group, during the pandemic. Despite this, Kazan emerged with new and enthusiastic members eager to continue its extensive legacy.
The showcase’s title, “Hibana,” became emblematic of the club’s revival and growth. In Japanese, the kanji characters for Hibana, read as “fire” and “flower,” serve to represent the brightness of taiko and the club’s blossoming into something beautiful and inspiring. 
“The theme ‘Hibana’ — it’s like ‘spark,’ so really about growth from dwindling to a tiny thing, then growing back into  this large event,” said Zoe Beyler, a junior majoring in percussion performance who serves as Kazan’s artistic director. “That’s what we really wanted to try to do with this concert, is really show we’re here, that we’re still playing. We have a big group, we have support, it’s still happening.”
Kazan itself is derived from the Japanese word for volcano. Esther Hsu, a senior majoring in human biology and East Asian languages and cultures who serves as the club’s executive director, sent “lotsa lava” to the show’s many attendees and supporters, including Cal State Northridge’s taiko group who was also in attendance, demonstrating the closeness of the art community. 
In addition to operating under the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the organization also collaborated with the USC Eastern Chamber Orchestra, who previously performed “Journey of the Elephant King,” featuring a variety of traditional Chinese instruments, including a zither and pipa. The partnership highlighted the diversity of cultural music on campus, which will also be featured during APASA’s upcoming night market on Thursday, where Kazan Taiko will be performing as well. 
“I would say, even though we’ve been established for around 20 years, we’re still kind of finding our space in USC, just because we are a smaller group, and we’re on a more traditional kind of Asian side,” Hsu said. “Recently, people have started taking notice of us. It kind of fluctuates every year. Now, we do have a home with the other Asian groups, especially under APASA.”
While Kazan Taiko aims to provide its members with means of expression through rhythm and movement, it looks to continue growing as a group and presence on campus.  
“Historically, we would already be coming in with at least a group of members who have had three years of experience, but everyone’s like, fresh here, so they have no idea what’s going on,” Hsu said. “We’re kind of like, resparking this tradition. Not restarting it, but reintroducing it to our group.”

Too often, USC students complain about not knowing how to make the most out of their sunny weekends in Los Angeles, because after visiting westside staples such as Santa Monica Beach, Melrose and the Grove, what else is there to do? Plenty! L.A. is a sprawling county filled with hundreds of vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own signature spots and personality. 
Your next Saturday calls for a hipster getaway to Northeast L.A. — specifically the adjacent Silverlake and Loz Feliz neighborhoods. These charming suburbs are known for their famous residents, beautiful homes, tree-lined avenues and array of small businesses. It only takes around 20 minutes to drive to the farthest location on your journey with normal traffic, meaning it is most definitely worth your time. 
Stop 1 -2: The morning 
Start the day bright and early with a thoroughly sunscreened face and a full stomach. Perhaps a trip to the USC Village dining hall for tater tots and pancakes — on a good day— would be a pleasant way to get your calories in and debrief with friends about whatever adventures took place the night before. Then, hop in a car and — if you are not the driver — try to figure out today’s Wordle before you reach your destination. 
Silver Lake Flea, 1925 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90026 
Your first stop is Silver Lake Flea, conveniently located in the parking lot of Taix French Restaurant. A relatively smaller market, it makes up in character what it lacks in size,  and the best part yet, entry is free. The space boasts an array of vendors selling primarily vintage clothes with homeware and accessories sprinkled in. The hipster vibe is strong for such a small amount of square footage, so stock up on some vintage cowboy boots from @_pineapple_closet__ on Instagram and a sturdy hat for Coachella. Although it is easy to lose track of time, be sure to save some money and energy for more shopping. 
Los Feliz Flea, 3939 Tracy St, Los Angeles, CA 90027
Next, drive 10 minutes away and across city lines to Los Feliz Flea. If you only have time to visit one of the two flea markets, this one has more to offer. If you opted to park on the street instead of the designated parking lot, keep your eyes peeled for unique garage sales that pop up in the quaint and welcoming front yards of the surrounding houses. Entry is also free here (Melrose Trading Post take notes). 
Set up in John Marshall High School, the flea is quite big so make a rough game plan for what path you will take to tackle it all. There is really no limit to what you will find here. Pick up a pastel slip dress from St. Sensuous for the spring and a quirky mug set for your USC dwelling this year or next. 
Stop 3: Time to eat
After walking around the whole day, you will have most definitely worked up a strong appetite. Visit one of these local restaurants for speedy take-out. 
Spitz, 1725 Hillhurst Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90027
More appealing than the vibrant murals encased outside of the building is the delicious Mediterranean street food served inside. Be sure to share the Berliner Fries among a few people. These crispy fries topped with carrot slaw, cucumber, tomato, cabbage, feta, olives, corn, pepperoncinis, tzatziki and their house berliner sauce puts plain fries to shame. Another staple at this restaurant is the doner kebab wraps. Doner kebab, the Turkish equivalent to shawarma, is made by slicing seasoned beef, chicken or lamb off of a vertical rotisserie spit, resulting in tender meat with slightly crisp bits. At Spitz, you can order this kebab wrapped with flavorful additions, such as lavash chips, garlic aioli and zesty feta, spread for an exceptionally hearty meal. 
Phở VT Vietnamese and Thai Kitchen, 1906 Hillhurst Ave Los Angeles, CA 90027
Magic happens in this tiny joint with blue-checkered floors and bright red walls. Although a steaming bowl of pho never disappoints, sunny spring weather means a refreshing, easily portable option is your best bet. Try their banh mi, which comes with your choice of protein and tangy pickled vegetables sandwiched between a crispy baguette. Spring rolls are also a great option with bright jalapeno, cucumber, creamy mayo and baked tofu or shrimp. If you are a fearless afternoon caffeine consumer, wash down your food with their ca phe suada, a combination of Vietnamese iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk that is a fun alternative to a conventional and sometimes boring vanilla latte. 
Stop 4: Lunch with a view, 2300 Silver Lake Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90039
Try your best to quell the urge to gobble down your food and drive a few minutes away to the Silver Lake meadow. Get settled on a comfy bench or sit on a picnic blanket and enjoy the view of the reservoir, beautiful hills stacked with houses and tons of dogs. Have fun in the fresh air and maybe ask for permission to pet a cute puppy. Take a leisurely walk on the pathways around the park to digest all of the food! 
At this point, everyone will be spent from their long and fulfilling day out. Recharge your social battery and replace the silence with some bops on the car ride back. Play some indie music and look mysteriously out of the window like the main character in an A24 film. A mix of tracks from The Marías, Spendtime Palace and Peach Pit should set the tone and serve as the perfect soundtrack to end your day.

Content warning: The following article mentions physical, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse.
I don’t think I’ve known peace since Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. 
Actually, let me rephrase that: I don’t think I’ve known peace since Chris Rock exploited Jada Pinkett Smith’s medical condition for a joke and then Will Smith retaliated. That’s better. 
Since the notorious incident at the 94th Annual Academy Awards, Will Smith has resigned from the Academy and has been banned from Academy events for 10 years. Newspaper headlines have littered social media with buzz words and worn-down fragments: “Violence is never the answer,” “toxic masculinity” and, as iterated by Judd Apatow, “He could have killed him!” 
Although we could argue all day about whether a slap would have killed Rock or whether Smith overreacted, the more pressing issue at hand revolves around the media and our culture’s disproportionate focus on the actual slap, rather than the words that instigated said slap. From left and right, I see people labeling Smith’s actions as a by-product of toxic masculinity. 
This isn’t to say that Smith’s actions were not a by-product of toxic masculinity. This same hypermasculine, “testosterone-driven” urge to defend one’s honor through violence and aggression is the same concept that we can partially blame for basically any war in existence. 
Our definition of toxic masculinity, however, focuses too closely on physical violence and disregards other forms of violence that can manifest as toxic masculinity. The slap precisely represents this conundrum: We are so overtly concerned about the slap and comedians’ safety, but what about the imbued violence in capitalizing off a joke that degrades a Black woman and exploits her medical condition?  
Moments before the infamous incident, Rock — face untouched — said, “Jada, I love you — I can’t wait for GI Jane 2.” 
The joke references Demi Moore’s shaved head in the 1997 action film, “GI Jane.” Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, a hair loss condition caused by an autoimmune disorder or pulling hair too tightly for too long, rolled her eyes shortly after. And the rest was history. 
Much of the rhetoric defending Rock closely resembles the same rhetoric your high school — or adult — bully would probably say after definitely hurting your feelings: “Take a joke!” or, the more juvenile but just as invalidating mantra, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words may never hurt me.” I heard that one a few times in the second grade. Thanks, Mrs. Davis. 
I have also seen plenty of attention following Pinkett Smith since the incident. Article headlines such as “What is Alopecia?” briefly depart from the focus of the slap but still miss the issue at hand — misogynoir and ableism. 
Writing for Time, Cathy Lang describes Black women’s hair and its “racialized and politicized” history — in workplaces, employers consider natural Black hair “unprofessional” compared to their white peers’ natural hair. 
Not to mention the fact that making someone’s medical condition the butt of a joke is insensitive to not only Pinkett Smith but also the other people who have alopecia and any other disability that affects their appearance. Rock, therefore, imbued his joke with a clash of insensitivities: He managed to follow the racist and ableist status quo and humiliate a Black woman for her hair loss condition.  
We saw this same paradigm last year during Black Lives Matter protests. When peaceful protests became bouts of looting, the focus quickly shifted away from the police officers who murdered Black people to the Black people who performed acts of political resistance. Suddenly, violence was not acceptable if Black people perpetrated it, but when our police and military enact violence, we glorify it. 
The Academy said it “does not condone violence of any form,” according to the statement it tweeted after the incident. However, it only condemned Smith’s slap and has not revoked convicted sex-offender Harvey Weinstein’s Oscars. It sounds like the Academy condones violence of any form except physical. 
If comedians are worried about the next Smith and firmly believe violence is not the answer, maybe they should also acknowledge their violent work — such as Dave Chappelle’s transphobic Netflix special. 
Ultimately, these kinds of attitudes toward Rock’s joke reflect a society that does not treat emotional and verbal abuse as seriously as physical violence. These attitudes come from the same society that often excludes intimate partner violence from “abuse.” They come from the same society that fails to prioritize mental health as much as physical health.
And, to be clear, this article is not my condoning Will Smith or Chris Rock’s actions. Rather it advocates for the victims of violence not always visible to the eye. Let’s add that disclaimer to our understanding of toxic masculinity.

In their book, “New Directions in Political Communication,” David L. Swanson and Dan Nimmo define “political communication” as “the strategic use of communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs, and actions on political matters.” For them, understanding persuasion and political discourse is essential for this discipline. 
USC offers a political science major that combines the study of political institutions and systems with inspection of public attitudes, engagement and thinking. Such a degree permits students to understand citizens’ relationships with the government. 
The University also allows students to obtain a communication major, specializing in theoretical and critical knowledge of how messages should be articulated to the public. This degree offers concentrations in politics, diplomacy, entertainment, technology and government studies. However, while these two separate majors teach students critical skills in various fields, it does not do enough for those looking to work in politics.
When comparing these two separate degrees, political science and communication intersect in how individuals express their ideas and opinions through political, electoral and governmental institutions. However, an interdisciplinary degree of political communication would combine the two and specialties in studying from three viewpoints: a downwards perspective towards citizens, a horizontal point of view of linkages through political actors and an upward view of public opinion favoring those in charge. 
Political communication allows students to specifically learn strategies that allow them to be the interface of political messaging. Whether it is as a policy advocate or a campaign executive, the integrative major does what political science and communication cannot as separate majors.
According to the Princeton Review, an undergraduate degree in political communication is not only  marketable but allows students to pursue jobs in political consulting, public affairs, political journalism, public diplomacy, speechwriting and political advertising. Thus, the degree is very versatile and allows people to work in the public or private sector. It also lets students utilize strategic communication to influence public knowledge, beliefs and action on matters facing the nation. 
However, USC does not offer a bachelor’s degree in political communication to its students. While there is a master of public diplomacy program at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, there is no undergraduate degree equivalent, and this master’s degree prioritizes the intersection between communication and global affairs, instead of the political sphere. 
There are three Annenberg minors that incorporate political science themes, but they are not enough to specialize in political communication. The communication policy and law minor combines courses in communication, law, ethics and the business of communication, with less emphasis on politics. The cultural diplomacy minor focuses on issues and engagement in the cultural sphere, with foreign policy being a focal component. The justice, voice and advocacy minor understands identity and community through theory, impact and change.
However, these minors do not fully consolidate political science characteristics into a general communication degree. Moreover, they do not contain communication-esque specializations, emphasizing politics, law and public policy in relation to communication.
While it is possible for an individual to create a political communication degree through USC’s Interdisciplinary Major Program, a program for students whose academic interests extend beyond a single field, doing so is impractical. While political communication has been chosen in the past as an accepted major topic, the program is highly competitive, with a faculty committee selecting what they view as the “best candidates,” then identifying specific courses for the student to take. 
Two Annenberg courses, “Argumentation and Advocacy” and “Campaign Communication,” could fall under the political communication program if the undergraduate major were to be established at USC. Currently, they only count for communication credits, even though “Argumentation and Advocacy” examines advocacy in law, politics and organizations, and “Campaign Communication” covers the creation of an informed electorate, the use of mass media and factors in voter persuasion.
Politics and communications often overlap, and a political communication degree could highlight the different ways this medium affects institutions and the people they represent. It would prepare students to function at the highest levels of government, public service and media entities. There is no real reason not to add this undergraduate major. USC is a top-tier school — adding an exceptional political communication major will only heighten its relevance in 21st century society and build more world leaders in the coming decade.

The 2022 World Cup is starting to heat up, and not just because the list of 32 qualifying countries has been finalized. What is traditionally a summer tournament will instead take place in November, as the host country Qatar is home to some particularly hot summers.
FIFA deemed it unsafe to expose players and fans to the extreme summer temperatures, which can reach over 110 degrees Fahrenheit. However, even in November, World Cup attendees will still need to find ways to beat the heat. 
Fortunately for fútbol fans, all of Qatar’s eight swanky stadiums have been configured to keep things cool. Each stadium is equipped with solar-powered air circulation technology that will keep the buildings at a constant 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 
It’s no spring day in Los Angeles, but it is certainly better than the blistering heat outside. The average high -temperature in Qatar is around 85 degrees Fahrenheit in November. 
Saud Abdulaziz Abdul-Ghani, a professor of mechanical engineering at Qatar University, who led the team that developed the technology required to cool the stadium with clean energy, wants other countries and corporations to follow suit in powering stadium air conditioning systems using eco-friendly methods. There is no patent on the technology, and Abdul-Ghani hopes the World Cup will highlight both the importance and feasibility of using green energy. 
The system works by cooling outside air with solar-powered air conditioning fans. The air enters the stadiums through grills in the stands and through large nozzles on the field, as players require cooler air. The air is circulated back from the inside of the stadium, re-cooled and filtered and then pushed back into the stadium. 
The solar farm, located west of Doha, Qatar’s capital city, cost roughly $462 million to construct and operate. The farm is home to over two million bifacial solar modules, which are twice as efficient as traditional solar panels because both sides of the panel absorb solar energy. 
Qatar’s large investment in clean energy is not just for the sake of keeping soccer fans comfortable. The 10- square- kilometer solar farm has the capacity to meet 10% of the country’s energy demands. It will also reduce the carbon emissions of Qatar by 26 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime. 
The investment Qatar made in solar energy will not only make the World Cup a more enjoyable experience for fans but also serves as a blueprint for what other countries could be doing to embrace sustainable energy and push toward reducing carbon emissions. 
About 12.6% of the total United States’ energy consumption came from renewable energy sources in 2020. Not bad, but the U.S. can certainly do better. Or maybe I should say, the U.S. must do better. 
Stop me if you’ve heard this seemingly alarmist but actually accurate remark before, but the effects of greenhouse gas emissions are already rearing their ugly heads on a global scale. It has become quite clear that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced on an international level. 
The U.S. has a gross domestic product of $20.94 trillion. Qatar, while it is significantly less populated and has one of the richest economies in the world, has a GDP of $146.4 billion. 
Even when considering the GDP per capita of each country, the U.S. still has a higher average. I apologize for all of the math, but I guess what I am trying to say is that there is so much room for improvement in climate affairs and so much money to invest in climate change solutions. 
Whether it’s building more solar farms or financing hydroelectricity projects, the U.S. must go all in on renewable energy sources, because it is an investment that, if done correctly, will pay off. 
An attempt by the Biden administration to inch closer to net-zero carbon emissions was shot down in a purely political move from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. The U.S. needs a radical restructuring of its climate action plan and unfortunately, the bureaucracy of the federal government has proven time and again to be too slow to act. 
Maybe when Manchin is watching the World Cup this November, he will be inspired to change his mind.

USC fell to No. 17 on the Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association poll after splitting its games against UC Berkeley and Stanford this weekend. 
The Trojans defeated the Golden Bears 20-11 Friday afternoon, moving them to 2-0 on the season against Cal. 
USC had one day of rest before springing back into action against the Cardinal. Unfortunately, the Trojans fell in a high-intensity, high-scoring game to No. 22 Stanford 23-17. 
The team will look to bounce back from this weekend as they finish up their regular season. 
“The biggest thing is battling back,” said Head Coach Lindsay Munday in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “You want to take the loss and be frustrated about it, but you don’t want to wallow in it.”
USC entered the last week at No. 13 after defeating top 15 Michigan. It began its weekend duo of games hot on offense. 
Three different players recorded hat tricks to lead the Trojans to their third straight victory Friday. USC was dominant the entire game, outscoring UC Berkeley in every quarter. They also won the loose-ball game 15-11 and the center circle, 18-17. 
Junior attacker Ella Heaney led the team and matched her career high with 5 goals scored, securing her hat trick in the first quarter. This victory moves the Trojans to 14-1 all time against the Golden Bears and marks their 14th straight against Cal. 
Sunday’s game against the Cardinal was incredibly back and forth. Five different Trojans scored goals in the first quarter, helping USC obtain a 6-3 lead. 
The Trojans opened the second quarter scoring 2 goals, taking a 4-point lead. Then, Stanford scored 7 unanswered goals to take a 3-point lead. 
In the second half, the Cardinal continued this momentum, taking a 16-11 lead in the third quarter. USC had several scoring bursts but ultimately fell short by 6 goals, losing 23-17. 
This loss was the Trojans’ third of the season and second in conference. Both conference losses have come against Stanford. 
Despite the loss, Munday said that the Trojans played at a very high level. 
“Offensively, we had a good weekend. We stepped up and we had some players have some breakout games,” Munday said.
Several players had outstanding games, including sophomore midfielder Madison Waters who scored a career-high 5 goals. 
Waters reflected on the newfound importance of the younger girls on the team. 
“Having some girls out that are leaders that are hurt recently, having younger people and people becoming leaders on and off the field has really helped grow our team,” Munday said.
This weekend, USC will continue its quest for the reins of the league with just three Pac-12 regular-season games, all of them on the road.
USC currently sits in second in the Pac-12 behind Stanford and just ahead of Arizona State. These next three games are vital for USC to gain optimal placement going into the Pac-12 tournament. 
USC last played the Buffaloes in the conference opener and secured an 11-7 victory. 
Its following game was against the Ducks when they won 21-5. USC will take on Colorado in Boulder at 3:00 p.m Friday. Then, on Sunday, the Trojans head even further north to take on Oregon in Eugene at 1:00 p.m.

The NBA play-in tournament began April 12, with the NBA playoffs starting April 16. Multiple Trojans are competing for their respective teams to earn a place in the NBA Finals. 
Here’s a look at each player’s season and playoff chances. 
Guard/forward DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
Veteran DeMar DeRozan has had a career year with the Chicago Bulls. He is fifth in the league in scoring, averaging 27.9 points per game — a career high in a season. He also averages 5.2 rebounds and 4.9 assists on the year. 
The leading scorer for the Bulls most recently scored 40 points April 5 against the defending champions, Milwaukee Bucks. 
The Bulls will be playing the Bucks in the first round of the playoffs. Even after getting back guard Alex Caruso, it will be a tough series for the Bulls without key guard Lonzo Ball. After starting the season hot, the Bulls have cooled off.
DeRozan and the Bulls are looking to carry their regular-season momentum into the playoffs, trying to reach the NBA Finals for the first time since 1998.
Guard De’Anthony Melton, Memphis Grizzlies
Fourth year guard De’Anthony Melton has been a huge piece off the bench for the second seed in the Western Conference, Memphis Grizzlies. The former Trojan is averaging career highs in points and rebounds, with 10.8 and 4.5, respectively. 
Melton has also been hot from deep, making four or more 3-pointers and shooting better than 50% from behind the arc in a six-game stretch in late March. The Grizzlies are 13-1 when Melton makes four or more 3-pointers. 
The Grizzlies will face either the Los Angeles Clippers or Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs. Melton will look to be a spark off the bench for the championship hopeful Grizzlies.
Center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
Rookie Evan Mobley made his NBA Playoffs debut Tuesday night. The eighth-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers traveled to Brooklyn to face the super star powered Nets, led by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving — who had 34 points and 12 assists on 12-of-15 shooting. 
Mobley had 19 points, 7 rebounds and 2 blocks in the 115-108 loss. The Cavs will now play the winner of the matchup between the Atlanta Hawks and Charlotte Hornets for the final spot in the Eastern Conference.
The rookie standout has dealt with some injuries, sustaining an ankle sprain March 28 against the Orlando Magic. However, he has recovered and played the last two games of the regular season, preparing for the play-in game against the Nets. 
Without Mobley, the Cavaliers are 4-9, so he will be a key piece for them to go deep into the playoffs. The projected rookie of the year will look to finish the season strong by securing a spot in the NBA playoff tournament against the Nets Tuesday.
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan’s teammate Nikola Vucevic has been a strong piece for the Chicago Bulls this season. Although he is averaging his lowest points per game since the 2017-18 season (17.6), he is still a huge contribution to the team, leading the Bulls in rebounds at 11.0 per game and blocks at 1.0 per game.
Against the Bulls’ future playoff opponent April 5, Vucevic scored just 7 points, shooting 3- of-19 from the floor. He also only brought down 6 rebounds and registered 0 blocks. 
Vucevic will look to bounce back from this performance and lead the 6-seeded Chicago Bulls over the Bucks in the opening round of the NBA playoffs. He has only been in the playoffs three times prior to this season since being drafted in 2011.
