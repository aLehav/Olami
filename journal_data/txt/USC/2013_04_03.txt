It’s been smooth sailing for the USC women’s water polo team for the last couple of weeks, but the squad will face two big challenges this week as it looks to stay undefeated against No. 11 Loyola Marymount (15-7) today and No. 7 UC Irvine (15-7) on Saturday.
The Women of Troy have faced big challenges this year in the form of grueling doubleheaders and highly ranked opponents, but this two-game set at the end of the week presents a different kind of challenge.
“With two games so close together, we get one less morning workout,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “With less hours in the water, it changes how much you can do for preparation.”
Though the team will have its endurance tested, there is no reason to believe the lack of rest will slow down the USC offensive attack. The Women of Troy have failed to score 10 goals in a game only twice this season, and in each of those games they scored nine.
Though sophomore driver Monica Vavic is the undisputed scoring leader with 54 goals, this is an offense that features all types of weapons and one that can score in many different ways. Whether they cut past defenders to find an open position to shoot or use the entire shot clock while passing the ball around the perimeter, this USC offense can adapt to situations and exploit any defense they encounter. This can be seen in the team’s gaudy goal differential in third quarters this season, as USC has outscored opponents 84-19 immediately after halftime.
“We’re very balanced offensively,” Jovan Vavic said. “All of our players can do more than one thing. To put it in basketball terms, we have players like Magic Johnson or LeBron James: they are very good both at outside shooting and driving the ball.”
Against the Lions of LMU, the Women of Troy will have to be at the top of their offensive game, as LMU has won its last six games, giving up a stingy average of only 4.1 goals per game. Granted, five of those games were against unranked opponents, but their last victory on March 23 came against No. 12 Princeton, gritting out a hard-fought 7-5 victory.
USC must be as good defensively as they are offensively during this week’s contests. Along with strong defensive pressure and the occasional field block — which have been becoming more frequent during the last few games — the Women of Troy will be counting on strong outings from junior goalie Flora Bolonyai.
A member of the fourth-place-finishing Hungarian national team in last year’s London Olympic games, Bolonyai has been stellar in the net for USC this season, saving 130 shots on goal and allowing only 4.9 goals allowed per game. For a team that’s offense scores an average of 16 goals per game, Bolonyai has done more than enough for her team to win games.
“In my opinion, Flora is the best goalie in the NCAA,” Jovan Vavic said. “She is very intelligent, studies the game and has developed each year. With her in the goal, we have been able to do more things defensively.”
Three USC players will continue their quest for 100 career goals, as Monica Vavic (93 goals), junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist (90 goals) and senior driver Dominique Sardo (83 goals) are on the cusp of reaching the milestone. Gilchrist and Sardo, however, bring much more to the table than their offensive abilities. They also lead the undefeated team as co-captains.
“[Gilchrist and Sardo] are a big reason why we are undefeated,” Jovan Vavic said. “Dominique was part of our championship team [in 2010], and she understands what it takes to lead the team in the right way.”
With just four games remaining until the MPSF Championships in Berkeley, Calif., the Women of Troy need only to maintain the top form that they’ve been in since the season began.  Three of the team’s final four games are on the road, which means the players must be that much more focused against potentially hostile crowds.
With a strong leadership core in place and talented players who dominate both sides of the ball, there is more than good reason to believe this team will come out of the weekend still unbeaten and still hungry to make a run at the NCAA championship. USC will take on LMU in Westchester today at 4 p.m. and will face the UCI in Irvine on Saturday at 1 p.m.

In the midst of a disappointing mid-season stretch that has seen the club fall short of title aspirations, the USC men’s volleyball team will alter its approach and simply look to end the season on a positive note.
The Trojans return to the Galen Center for their final two home games of the season, as they host Long Beach State tonight before taking on Cal State Northridge on Saturday night.
The 2013 season has not been kind to the Trojans, who sport a dismal 5-15 record just one year after notching 26 wins and reaching the NCAA championship final against UC Irvine. After a promising 3-1 win against Pepperdine on March 21, USC has hit another road block, dropping a match 3-2 to Cal Baptist before suffering a sweep at the hands of BYU last Saturday (14-25, 15-25, 24-26).
Though the Trojans had to deal with a quick turnaround in travelling to Utah and now face the No. 1 Cougars on Saturday, USC head coach Bill Ferguson was not interested in using the long trip as an excuse for the losses.
“It was tough, but that’s why we’re playing,” Ferguson said. “Our job is to have our guys ready to make that trip and perform that task, and we didn’t do as good of a job as we could have done to get ready for it.”
The Trojans were led by redshirt junior opposite Tanner Jansen, who contributed nine kills off the bench. Freshman outside hitter Alex Slaught notched eight kills while hitting a sound .462, and sophomore setter Micah Christenson added seven digs.
But the Trojan defense proved no match for a powerful Cougar attack. BYU junior outside hitter Taylor Sander recorded 17 kills while hitting a sterling .762, and freshman opposite Ben Patch put together 10 kills and 5 blocks.
USC gave BYU a run for its money with a strong, hard-fought third set. Ferguson pointed out that his team played quite well at stretches yet again failed to channel this into any type of match-long consistency.
“We had issues passing the ball all through the first set and through the first half of the second set,” Ferguson said. “I thought that our level of play in certain areas was, again, fantastic in the first half of the first set, but once we hit the middle we started to make poor attack decisions. But BYU, to their credit, made some unbelievable defensive stops.”
In previewing this week’s matches, Ferguson placed added emphasis on the team’s return to the Galen Center for its final two home games.
“I’m hoping our home facility isn’t actually foreign to us,” Ferguson joked, noting the team’s forced move to the Lyon Center following a stretch of other conflicting events at the Galen Center.
“I think having played the matches this weekend will prepare us for this week’s matches. BYU runs a varied offense which is similar to what Northridge does,” Ferguson added, “and Cal Baptist is oriented to the outside hitter which is very similar to what Northridge runs, so we’re going to try to tweak some things and build on that.”
The Trojans have just one senior on the roster in outside hitter Maddison McKibbin. But McKibbin, a co-captain, will likely redshirt after sitting out the entire season while recovering from a stress fracture in his right shin.
Following this week’s games, the Trojans will once again hit the road for the final time this season, squaring off against UC Santa Barbara and UCLA next week.
Another Club coach in over his head. Lost all five 5th sets this season which is on the coaching staff.
Ferguson couldn’t win it all when the team had the talent last few season. Now with mediocre recruiting the last
four years team has become a doormat in the conference similar to the regime of Turhan Douglas his predecessor.
 Interesting comparison to the woman’s soccer coach Ali K. who won the national title in his first season , now
the program is irrelevant on the national scene for last two years at least.

To get his point across, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden felt the need to say it twice.
“USC basketball should be relevant,” Haden said in his opening remarks Wednesday before he introduced new USC head basketball coach Andy Enfield.
“USC basketball should be relevant.”
Haden won’t find many who disagree with him. As he said during a Jan. 17 game against Oregon — shortly after he relieved Kevin O’Neill of his head coaching duties — USC has all the resources needed to build a perennial contender in the Pac-12. Location, facilities and private school funding are all assets USC has that many other schools covet. The only thing missing was someone to lead the charge.
Is Enfield that someone? That will be decided on the court in the near future. However, what Wednesday’s press conference did confirm was this: Haden is not afraid to take a chance.
In roughly two and a half years since becoming USC’s athletic director, Haden, until this week, had yet to make a major coaching hire. This is amazing considering the huge impact he has had on USC athletics since taking over.
Haden assumed the job under immense NCAA scrutiny while both the football and men’s basketball programs faced NCAA sanctions, and he has made incredible strides in cleaning up USC’s compliance image. He also has been much more visible on and around campus than predecessor Mike Garrett, frequently interacting with media and students and even going so far as to participate in a Feb. 24 “Harlem Shake” video amid the student section at a basketball game.
In his time at the helm of the school’s athletic program, though, he had yet to conduct his own coaching search. He inherited head football coach Lane Kiffin, as well as O’Neill, and after firing former head baseball coach Frank Cruz on Feb. 13, he merely removed current head coach Dan Hubbs’ interim title and made him the permanent head coach.
So what does Haden do in his first chance to really make his mark? He eschews more experienced, proven coaches with extensive resumes and career achievements in favor for Enfield: the wild card, the new kid on the block, one whose national name recognition dates as far back as three weeks and whose Division I head coaching experience spans only two years.
But remember, Haden said that USC basketball needed to be relevant, and by choosing Enfield over, say, former UCLA coach Ben Howland or current UTEP coach and former USC coach Tim Floyd, the Trojans instantly become just that.
For the past two weeks, Enfield’s former team, Florida Gulf Coast University, has been the talk of the college basketball world, even after it was eliminated in the Sweet 16 by Florida. Enfield needed just three days and two wins to turn a school in just its second year of Division I eligibility into a nationally trending topic. He is exactly what Haden was looking for, in more ways than one.
If Enfield can have a similar impact on the stagnant USC basketball program, then this decision will be a huge success. But even more than that is the fact that Haden has finally gotten a chance to take his shot.
This is by far the biggest decision he has had to make during his tenure at USC and, even though the decision took him longer than many had hoped, Haden refused to play it safe and instead went with his gut on a coach who, quite frankly, hasn’t accomplished much of anything yet in his young coaching career.
But these are the types of decisions that combat complacency and, as Haden assuredly hopes, irrelevancy. You can’t make a major leap as a program without taking a few risks, and Haden just pushed all of his chips to the center of the table on this one. This has been met with lots of excitement and some skepticism, both of which are justified.
Still, all USC fans should take comfort in knowing that the man pulling the strings behind their favorite teams isn’t afraid to buck conventional wisdom every once in a while if he thinks it’s the best decision for his program. Enfield sure is glad Haden isn’t, anyway.
“I want to thank you for believing in me, Pat,” Enfield said. “I’m going to show up every day in this office and make this a better place than it was the day before, and I look forward to it.”
What better way is there to reward Haden’s trust?

The first question posed to new USC men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield during his introductory press conference on Wednesday carried a bit of local flavor.
On the map · After vaulting little-known FGCU onto the national stage, Athletic Director Pat Haden (left) hopes Enfield can do the same at USC. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
“What are your initial thoughts on the crosstown rivalry with UCLA?” he was asked.
Enfield stood tall. Without much hesitation, he respectfully acknowledged the Bruins’ history of success on the hardwood. And before long, he changed the subject.
“I’m focused on the future of USC basketball and no one else,” he said.
Enfield’s focus on USC’s future is hardly surprising, if only because the Trojans’ past, particularly their recent past, has been marked by a number of difficulties on the court. Over the last two seasons, USC has gone 20-44, including a school-worst 26 losses during the 2011-12 season. In short, Enfield has his work cut out for him.
“USC basketball should be relevant, but let’s be honest, it has not been relevant,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said Wednesday. “We’re about to change that, we believe.”
Haden believes that in part because of Enfield’s recent success at Florida Gulf Coast University, where he guided the Eagles to a Sweet 16 appearance in just their second season of Division I eligibility. They also became the first-ever 15th seed to advance past the first weekend of the NCAA tournament.
FGCU’s run in the NCAA tournament helped launch the 43-year-old Enfield, a former assistant at Florida State and in the NBA, onto the national stage, as he employed an entertaining, above-the-rim style of play affectionately referred to as “Dunk City.” In its two tournament wins, FGCU averaged 80 points per game.
“Basketball is entertainment,” Enfield said. “So is every sport. You have to entertain the fans and make them want to come. If you play a slow down style and you don’t win, they’re not going to show up.”
USC knows that all too well. Under former coach Kevin O’Neill, who was fired in mid-January, it ranked last in points per game among schools from the “power six” conferences, which includes the ACC, Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC, according to ESPN. And though that figure increased over the final two months of the season under interim head coach Bob Cantu, the Trojans still averaged just 65.7 points per game, good for 217th nationally.
Under Enfield’s fast-paced, up-tempo style, that will hopefully change.
“It’s exciting,” junior guard Byron Wesley said. “It’s going to be able to draw a lot of fans here. L.A. is the perfect place for it. And it can definitely be a huge boost for our team and our community.”
Though Haden maintains realistic expectations for the team moving forward, USC is hoping the transition isn’t a long one.
“One of the big things that impressed me was the turnaround they saw at Florida Gulf Coast in his two years at the school,” Haden said. “That’s what we want at USC. We want to reset the basketball culture, and that starts today.”
Time will tell if that works.
For now, Enfield will need to finalize the rest of his coaching staff, a process he said he hopes to finish within the next seven to 10 days.
Enfield met with Cantu, assistant coaches Dieter Horton and Tony Miller and players Wednesday morning. All three coaches could be retained by Enfield, but there is no certainty that they will be.
Notes
When USC formally announced the hiring of Enfield on Monday night via Twitter and on its website, the school used the hashtag #DunkCityUSC, a play off his old team’s nickname. FGCU officials, though, weren’t pleased. “There is only one Dunk City, USA: It’s here in Southwest Florida,” Athletic Director Ken Kavanagh said in a press conference on Tuesday. Haden said USC would in fact stop using the moniker. … A police investigation into the March incident involving USC players Dewayne Dedmon and James Blasczyk remains ongoing. When asked about Dedmon’s status with the team, Haden declined to comment. Dedmon was in attendance at Wednesday’s team meeting with Enfield, sources said.
USC bball hasn’t been relevant since before I graduated in 1980! That’s when even Ronnie Lott saw court time during the then, PAC 10 conference game. Good luck Andy!  Would love to be relevant!
Enfield’s dream came true when he increased his salary around 1 million dollars from last year. A lot like a
movie actor who hits it big with one top movie at the box office then becomes the darling of the cinema crowd.
His team beats Georgetown and SDSU on the big stage while they lose twice to Lipscomb hidden in obscurity
during the regular season. Again like the fourth or fifth choice for head coach who knows how it will turn out in
the end of his third season at the helm.
That’s the Trojan spirit.  Not.  You sound like a whiny bRuin.  I wish coach Enfield and the basketball team much success.  Fight on!

By all accounts, USC is the perfect school for a young athlete. It’s a Division I school with a tradition of winning. It’s rich in resources, in personnel and in funding. And it’s a breeding ground for successful professional careers.
But for Matthew, a male varsity athlete whose name has been changed for anonymity, the experience at USC has been tempered by one fact.
He’s gay.
“You are fighting for your respect. You are fighting for your manhood. You are fighting for your masculinity,” Matthew told the Daily Trojan. “That’s one of the things that mainly comes into play.”
Though Matthew is out to some friends, he has not shared his sexual orientation with coaches or teammates.
“It will complicate things to the magnitude to where I don’t know if I will be able to handle that at this point,” he said. “I just don’t know if there is enough support for that.”
Though many openly gay athletes at USC are comfortable on their teams and report a respectful environment, Matthew is not alone. Several athletes declined to be interviewed, even anonymously, for this story.
And this is an issue that persists at universities throughout the nation. In a 2012 survey of 8,481 NCAA athletes, lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning athletes reported pressure to keep their sexual orientation from their teammates (394 participants, or about five percent, of the sample identified as LGBQ).
But USC administrators, at least in recent years, have not turned a blind eye to the issue.
It Gets Better
Last February, the head coaches of USC’s varsity teams huddled in a room for a monthly meeting.
It was a first for the department. Two gay athletes had come to speak about what it was like to hide their identities from their coaches. They also discussed how coaches should approach LGBT athletes on their teams and how fostering a comfortable environment can improve performances. And, by all accounts, the talk struck a chord.
“I think they were just trying to expose to the coaches on our staff that you are clearly going to have gay kids on your teams and, if you’re not comfortable with it, get comfortable with it,” said Dave Salo, who coaches men’s and women’s swimming.
Since Athletic Director Pat Haden took the job in 2010, USC’s Athletic Department has set on a different course in its support of LGBT athletes.
“This is the first time student athletes have come into the coach’s meeting and stood up and said, ‘Hey, I’m gay. And this is what it’s like. And this is what I look to my coach to give me,’” said Donna Heinel, a senior associate athletic director. “That’s a monumental step. That’s because the atmosphere has changed in the last two years since Pat [Haden] has taken over.”
For the last four years, the LGBT Resource Center had been meeting at least once a semester with athletic administrators. But after the athletics leadership change in 2010, the center began taking a more active role.
“It wasn’t until a lot of these changes happened that we were getting more leeway  — we were getting more progress — with providing support to LGBT athletes,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
Last semester, the center began ally training with some athletic department staff teams, including Student-Athlete Academic Services and the weights and training team. This semester, the ally training, which includes information about the struggles of coming out and resources on campus, is open to all staff teams.
Vigil also hopes to develop a confidential support group for LGBT athletes, similar to Greek Chat, a weekly group for LGBT students in the Greek community (Vigil underscored that the identity of LGBT athletes who seek resources, either through the center or the Athletic Department, remain confidential).
“We want to make certain they don’t feel alone, they don’t feel isolated [and] that they know there are other students going through the same thing they are,” Vigil said.
This in and of itself is a step toward creating an accepting climate within the program, according to Jim Buzinski, the CEO of Outsports.com, a blog about the convergence of sports and the LGBT community.
“It has to be sort of broadcast,” said Buzinski, a former sports editor at the Long Beach Press-Telegram. “They have to let this be known. They have to have seminars and meetings and bring this up as a general thing.”
Room for Improvement
Despite the Athletic Department’s recent efforts to support its LGBT community, Matthew said he feels pressure from the attitudes of his coaches and the program-at-large.
“The culture of the program is very conservative,” he said. “That’s the way it has always been. That’s the ’SC way.”
The general environment at USC is one of the reasons Mallory Smith, a club softball player last year, was not open about her sexual orientation while on the team. Smith, who came out as a lesbian during her freshman year of high school, even questioned adding some of her teammates to Facebook, where she posts photos of herself with her girlfriend.
“At USC, especially with girls, it’s hard for lesbians to make straight girl friends because I feel there is still that stigma,” Smith said.
The structure of a sport also plays a role in coming out, many athletes explained. Smith, who went on to compete in boxing, said she found it easier to come out on a team where competition is more individualized, a sentiment echoed by experts and athletes alike.
LGBT stereotypes, though they have decreased in past years, can also affect the environment around the team, according to Buzinski.
“It’s lessening but it’s still there in people’s minds. It’s like people say everyone who is a skater has to be gay whereas a football player can’t be,” Buzinski said. “Well, no. You can be a straight skater and a gay football player. But our stereotypes are still strong.”
And because of these stereotypes and other factors, athletes are often concerned that coming out might seriously affect their prospects for a professional career.
“I just know I’m going to regret it if I come out before I sign a contract,” Matthew said.
A difference also exists between the experience of male and female athletes. In the Campus Pride survey, a higher proportion of female athletes (8 percent) identify with the LGBQ community than male athletes (3 percent).
For Sean Mulroy, a gay swimmer who has been out since high school, participating openly at USC has never been a problem, but he added  that it’s a struggle for athletes who must contend with coming out during their college years.
“When I got to college, I knew who I was and I was very confident,” Mulroy said. “But if people are struggling with that here, it definitely would hinder their ability to come out on a team, because it does take a lot of guts to go ahead [and say], ‘Yo, I’m gay.’”
According to the Campus Pride survey, LGBQ athletes are also two times more likely to experience harassment than their straight counterparts. Mulroy and several other athletes said verbal or physical intimidation is rare. More common are gay jokes, according to Matthew, which can unknowingly make closeted athletes uncomfortable.
“It’s like I can’t show that [I’m uncomfortable],” he said. “It’s not like I’m participating in it, but it is uncomfortable because it hits home because you know that people are rejecting who you are.”
Trickle-Down
Coaches are key to fostering a comfortable environment for LGBT athletes, as crafting greater acceptance often starts at the top, according to Robin Scholefield, a USC sports psychologist who works closely with LGBT athletes.
“In general, the teams that are safer are the ones where the coaches have been able to articulate an acceptance for all differences, including sexual orientation,” Scholefield said.
But in the heat of the game, coaches can forget how damaging their demeanor or language can be; in a recent example, video of former Rutgers men’s basketball coach Mike Rice showed him screaming homophobic slurs at players.
Even in less-extreme situations, LGBT athletes have their own perceptions about a coach’s view, and they said that this greatly affects how comfortable they feel on the team.
Portia Mitchell, a center for women’s basketball from 2000-02, was out to her team while playing at USC. Mitchell said she felt knowledge of her sexual orientation might have affected her role on the team.
“I always had some thought in the back of my mind that my sexuality did have an effect on my coach’s willingness to play me and fill the role she said I would fill when I was a recruit,” Mitchell said.
Part of these perceptions might stem from a generational difference,  particularly with older coaches, Matthew noted.
“That whole entire generation is probably not accepting of what’s forthcoming,” he said. “Now, when a new coaching staff comes in, it will be interesting to see how they receive it and how attitudes change.”
Heinel came to USC in 2003 after coaching swimming at the University of Massachusetts. She said she does not believe USC coaches as a whole are homophobic, despite some athletes’ perceptions.
“I don’t see any of our coaches kind of carrying that,” Heinel said. “For a lot of them, I don’t think that’s part of their DNA. I don’t think they would get to this high of a level.”
And Salo, as a USC coach, believes his players are living in a more accepting environment than the one he grew up in.
“Kids nowadays are so much more enlightened because they are exposed either through media or the news or publications about gays and lesbians,” Salo said. “It’s not this taboo word. It’s just something.”
Nevertheless, Mulroy, who maintains a strong relationship with head assistant swimming coach Jeremy Kipp (he sometimes asks about Mulroy’s personal life), said coaches should always be aware that some of their players might be gay.
“[It’s important to] make coaches aware that they probably will have an LGBT athlete on their team and how to approach it because I assume that football coaches don’t necessarily know how to wrap their heads around me listening to Whitney Houston in the weight room,” Mulroy said.
Next Season
When Mitchell played basketball about 10 years ago, she said she knew of very few gay athletes.
“At that time, it was so hush-hush that, unless you were someone like me who just lived your life and didn’t care, you were going to keep it under wraps between your teammates and to yourself to make sure that everything went smoothly,” Mitchell said.
With the national dialogue more focused on LGBT issues, Mitchell, who is still involved in university life through USC’s LGBT Alumni Association and occasionally visits her former team, said the environment has changed slightly.
“The gay culture overall in the last 10 years has become a lot more open, especially in L.A. and with things like Prop 8 going on,” Mitchell said. “It’s more of a vocal topic and not so hush-hush.”
But challenges still exist. For many gay athletes, coming out is still a particular struggle.
“A lot of people say we are in 2013 and gay marriage is being accepted so coming out should be easy,” Vigil said. “But it’s still going to be difficult for those within athletics.”
Additionally, there tend to be fewer out athletes in higher-profile sports, such as football, basketball and baseball, Vigil said.
“There probably are gay athletes in there, but there aren’t any who are proclaiming their identity very proudly,” Vigil said. “But that doesn’t mean that’s not going to happen. It’s a progression.”
With scholarships and professional careers on the line, athletes often stake a lot in their image, which could determine how teammates treat them both off the field and on. This compounds the already complex and tricky process of coming out, Buzinski said.
“You have just the process of coming out when you are young. Then you have the whole athletic thing and the whole team atmosphere,” Buzinski said. “It just makes it dicey. People don’t want to rock the boat. They fear that they will be treated differently and they’ll hear things in the locker room.”
Developing an accepting culture from top to bottom is crucial in creating a respectful environment for LGBT athletes, experts agreed.
“A system is only as good as the individuals in the system and it takes time to do that,” Scholefield said.
At the professional level, straight athletes who have been supportive of LGBT issues have helped improve the climate for athletes, Vigil said, citing Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe as an example. Kluwe  publicly excoriated a Maryland legislator last September for suggesting that a Baltimore Ravens player be silenced for his pro gay-marriage stance.
As more allies speak out, Vigil believes it will be easier for LGBT athletes to do the same.
“Athletes who are straight have a lot more pull in telling other guys it’s OK to be gay,” Smith said.
According to Buzinski, athletic departments have found success in creating greater acceptance for LGBT athletes by stressing diversity and a tolerance for all differences.
“That message gets down and makes everybody feel comfortable,” he said.
Many LGBT athletes at USC still face an uphill — and often covert — battle. But the climate has steadily improved and administrators are hopeful for the future.
“What I can say is we definitely have an increased tolerance,” Scholefield said. “Can we have more? Yes we can.”

Panelists urged bipartisan compromise on immigration reform during Wednesday’s weekly Students Talk Back.
The discussion, moderated by Dornsife’s Jesse M. Unruh Director Dan Schnur and Daily Trojan News Editor Yasmeen Serhan, began with a broad immigration overview by panelists.  The panel, held in The Forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, was presented in partnership with the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the Tomás Rivera Policy Institute and the Bedrosian Center on Governance and Public Enterprise.
Compromise · Panelists Carrie Lopez (left to right), Shikhar Gupta, Michael Madrid and Giuseppe Robalino discuss the importance of bipartisan compromise on immigration reform Wednesday afternoon in The Forum. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Grassroots Lab Principal Michael Madrid provided an economic perspective on reform to the discussion, noting that comprehensive reform was necessary for the nation’s economic health. Much to the appreciation of students in the audience, Madrid said all levels of the economy need an influx of individuals to replace a generation of workers.
“There is a desperate cry from corporate America and employers for comprehensive reform,” Madrid said. “From top to bottom, we need to have a workforce replacing the retiring baby-boomer generation.”
On the topic of a growing demand for professional jobs, USC College Democrats Director of Underclassmen Engagement Shikhar Gupta noted that comprehensive immigration reform could bring in a workforce from the science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields in to help the United States’ economic growth.
“There is actually a proposal to give green cards to students with advanced degrees in STEM fields,” Gupta said. “Green cards would give permanent residency to these individuals and would have the impact of attracting people that we need for a growing economy.”
Though USC College Republicans member Giuseppe Robalino agreed with the economic implications of immigration reform, he cautioned against overlooking the adverse effects of reform.
“There are very broad and deep implications once we start discussing the economic implications,” Robalino said. “I think this is yet to be measured and yet to be seen, but it is something that needs to be considered.”
Though economic considerations remained at the heart of the discussion, the panelists touched on the impact the polarization within Congress will have on immigration reform legislation moving forward.
Though many view immigration to be a largely democratic party cause, Hispanas Organizing for Political Equality Leadership Institute Chair Carrie Lopez said that this was not always the case.
“I want you to understand that no party owns this issue,” Lopez said. “When I was going to school, this was the issue of the day, and it was Ronald Reagan that led the front then. Fast-forwarding to 2007, all the solutions had elements from both sides of the aisle. Overall, the message is: Don’t stop questioning where the solution is going to come from.”
Robalino said the Republican Party needs to re-adjust its strategy in light of the low Latino support in last year’s presidential election.
“I do think the Republican Party is starting to re-examine itself and its policies,” Robalino said. “There are two things that are being said today — one is to take a more moderate stance and second is to say the same thing in ways that are less polarizing.”
Madrid said divided government would require sacrifices by both parties.
“Because of the redistricting, the Democrats can’t gain control of the House of Representatives for the foreseeable future in the same way the Republicans are not going to gain the White House in the foreseeable future,” Madrid said. “Both sides have to compromise.”
Though some members of the audience questioned the feasibility of passing pieces of the legislation one at a time, Gupta cautioned against this.
“If we were to piecemeal the legislation, it would cause attacks on each other’s legislation,” Gupta said. “The purpose of having this in one legislation is that it fosters compromise.”
Josh DeMilta, a senior majoring in political science, said the discussion made him more aware of the bipartisan support for the issue that isn’t always represented.
“It was interesting because I wasn’t quite aware of the bipartisan support for immigration reform,” DeMilta said. “I thought it would be more divided by political affiliation.”
Catherine Shieh, a junior majoring in political science and urban planning, cautioned against thinking narrowly about the groups impacted by immigration reform. Shieh also said the words used in the debate carry a negative connotation.
“Because [immigration reform] is such a broad issue, it’s difficult to discuss all aspects of it,” Shieh said. “It is important to respect the fact that though the Latino population is the largest population of immigrants, Asian-Americans are actually the fastest growing population of immigrants. Going forward, we’re going to define who holds the power in the discussion. The language is so tricky that sometimes we forget about it. When we say certain words, that is alluding to certain communities and carrying certain connotations.”
In general, I don’t believe in the premise itself, when the topic of “immigration reform” is discussed.  The rarely-spoken truth is that the United States already has some of the most generous and welcoming immigration policy of any nation in the world.  There can be no doubt when one looks at the vast numbers of people from around the world and from all economic backgrounds, who are naturalilzed as citizens every year.  The reality is that the debate over immigration reform stems largely from an increasingly militant and politically-motivated force who believe that immigrants who are already here illegally, are somehow entitled to citizenship.   Any honest and genuine debate on immigration reform must include a discussion of this reality.
Also lost in the discussion is the fundamental irony that the group most represented in the illegal-immigrant population… latinos and hispanics… is also the group most represented in the numbers of naturalized citizens each year.  The debate over immigration reform inevitably focusses on latinos and hispanics because they make up the majority of our illegal population.  Their message of a self-proclaimed right to citizenship is often stoked by marches and rallies where illegal immigrants and their supporters chant “Si Se Puede” and carry signs reading “Undocumented and Unafraid”.   Hearing and reading messages like that, you would mistakenly think that latinos and hispanics aren’t allowed to become citizens.  Was any of this discussed at Wednesday’s panel discussion?
There is no doubt that the United States needs to address the circumstance of our existing illegal immigrant population in a single and unified voice, particularly when you have states like Arizona that are trying to make some headway while states like California are content to do nothing at all.  Compromise will be essentialin addressing the chaos, but I think few people at Wednesday’s panel discussion (let alone across the country) understand that allowing existing illegal immigrants to stay in the country at all, is itself, compromise.
Let me be clear.  The only true compromise can be “permanent residency” (the so-called “green card”).  There can be no “path to citizenship” for existing illegals as a part of any fair immigration reform.  Offering permanent residency to illegals currently in the country will grant them legal status, and the right to work.  That’s a very generous offer to someone who is already here illegally.  In fact, permanent residency grants almost all the rights and responsibilites of citizenship, except the right to vote in our elections.  Again, this is a very fair and generous offer to someone who came here illegally.  Just ask me:  I am a legal immigrant who was naturalized, who in fact attended USC legally, with permanent residency, prior to becoming a citizen.
If illegal immigrants want amnesty and legalization, then permanent residency is the answer.  As mentioned earlier, the United States already offers a path to citizenship, and they refused to take advantage of it.  This is no time to reward their bad and illegal behaviour.  Any illegal immigrant currently here who wishes to gain full-fledged citizenship must first leave the country, and then apply like everyone else does… including the thousands of latinos, hispanics and others from around the world, who do so every year.    It’s time to end the lies and disingenuous rhetoric that too-often dominates the debate over immigration reform.  It’s wholly unfair to the millions of Americans… like myself… who have literally paid their dues and followed the fair and open process necessary to become citizens of this great country.

With age, regular physicals become more important to a person’s health. Such is also the case with climate assessments and the environment, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger explained during an interview with the Daily Trojan on Monday.

Schwarzenegger will speak at USC on April 8 during a public comment forum in which regional scientists will present stark findings from a draft chapter of the third National Climate Assessment.
The Southwest Region chapter, which includes California, projects that effects of climate change might include decreasing water supplies for cities and agriculture, increases in wildfires and rising sea levels. Presenters will discuss climate research on subjects ranging from the water supply to tree mortality.
“[A physical] gives an evaluation of your body and what you can do to protect it down the line so you don’t continue that trend,” Schwarzenegger said. “And this is what this assessment report does. It gives you an idea of where we are and where we go with that and what we need to do in order to improve the situation.”
USC’s Schwarzenegger Institute and the Center for Sustainable Cities, which opened in September, will host the forum. Through sponsoring the event, the institute hopes to shine a spotlight on an issue that normally would receive little attention.
“This report was kind of a low-key issue that would just go by and be just another report that I don’t think many people would pay attention to,” Schwarzenegger said. “And we then try to make sure that the media does pay attention to it and report on it.”
Several scientists presenting at the forum commented on the importance of raising awareness for climate trends. University of Arizona Professor Thomas Swetnam, who will present findings on tree mortality, said the media has not accurately captured the magnitude of climate change.
“There really hasn’t been that much media coverage of the impacts that have occurred and are likely to occur,” Swetnam said.
A Media Matters report from last year shows that about 9 percent of television segments and 26 percent of print articles covered the record-breaking heat last July.
David Pierce, a Scripps College climate researcher studying water issues in Southern California, noted that it’s particularly important to be conscious of climate change predictions for infrastructure planning.
“Forewarned is forewarned,” he said. “I should mention any changes to water infrastructure or water allocation can take decades to accomplish. It’s better to start your planning on any adaptation early rather than waiting too long.”
Scientists argued the issues presented in the report could have serious ramifications that the public should be attuned to. Swetnam warned that climate change could threaten iconic tree species, even California’s giant sequoia.
“Is climate going to change enough to cause a loss of some of these national treasures? Right now science is suggesting yes, they are at risk,” Swetnam said. “So we need to take action.”
Schwarzenegger, who actively worked to curb climate change as governor, said he hopes to reach a broader audience by using the institute to spotlight the report.
“It is global warming and not just California warming. There is only so much we can do as a state,” Schwarzenegger said. “I think that the institute has given me the platform to talk to the rest of the world, especially to all the academic institutions around the world.”
Schwarzenegger is planning on writing a letter to the president and congressional leaders after Monday’s forum, according to Bonnie Reiss, the institute’s global director.
The hearing came about when Hilda Blanco, interim director of the USC Center for Sustainable Cities and a lead author of the chapter, approached Reiss with the primary motivation of bringing more attention to the issue.
“She came and she said, ‘Sadly, this is the third scientific report in 23 years, and it has very dramatic findings and it won’t get attention,’” Reiss said.
Using a university as the forum’s setting is important to Schwarzenegger because he believes students should be more involved in the political process.
“The key thing with all of this is to inspire the students to get involved because I believe that the mistake that has been made in the past is that we always look to government for the answers and the solutions,” Schwarzenegger said. “But, in fact, we should challenge the average person — everybody — out there to participate because that’s how movements become successful.”
The forum will be held in Lewis Hall auditorium on April 8 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Public comment on the third National Climate Assessment draft ends on April 12 and can be submitted online.

U.S. Senator Al Franken spoke about the influence of the Jewish tradition on public service on Wednesday at the 12th annual Carmen and Louis Warschaw Distinguished Lecture, hosted by the USC Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life. The event was held in the Davidson Executive Conference Center.
Tradition · Minnesota Senator Al Franker speaks to students about the role his Jewish heritage played throughout his extensive political career. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The junior senator from Minnesota, who was elected to Congress in 2008, used the charisma and storytelling skills that he developed as a Saturday Night Live comedy writer and political satirist.
“Today I’d like to talk about three Jews: a printing salesman, a rabbi and a professor,” Franken said. “This, mind you, is not the set up for a joke.”
To many laughs and much applause, Franken began his narrative by talking about his father, who was a printing salesman. Though he spoke of the humble beginnings of growing up in a Minneapolis suburb, Franken maintained that he considered himself “one of the luckiest kids alive.” He credits his father with inciting both his love of humor, as well as his political views, which were largely shaped by images of the civil rights movement playing out in the south.
“My dad, when he saw demonstrators being clubbed and having dogs sicked on them, he turned to me and my brother and he would say ‘That is wrong. No Jew can be for that,’” Franken said.
His religious relationship with his childhood rabbi reinforced his ideas of righteousness.
“Rabbi Shapiro always used to say that it wasn’t enough simply to be just,” Franken said. “You have to do justice.”
Franken said Paul Wellstone, who was Franken’s predecessor in the Senate seat and served as his member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said he was an helpful example of the intersection between public diplomacy and civil rights.
“It really wasn’t until I met the third Jew in my story, the professor, that I understood how public service represents a special kind of call to action, a special chance to do justice,” Franken said.
Franken said that he developed a strong interest in politics while campaigning for Wellstone during his first senate race because humor was inherent a part of the field.
Though Franken is known for his liberal political views, his speech was not political in nature. Rather, he spoke of politics as a vehicle for positive change.
“Politics is about the improvement of people’s lives,” Franken said.
During the question-and-answer discussion that followed his speech, Franken continued to emphasize the role of his Jewish heritage played in his public service experience.
“I hope that your Jewish faith, your Jewish values and your Jewish role models are as powerful a source of strength and wisdom for you as mine have been for me,” Frank said as he addressed the Jewish people in the audience.
Though those in attendance were primarily alumni and community members, students had positive reactions toward his speech.
“I loved that it was a personal story. He’s a very political guy with very strong views, but I think the lecture stayed true to his purpose,” said Brandon Cheung, a freshman majoring in political science.
Aaron Taxy, the president of USC College Democrats, said he was “star struck” following the event because of the senator’s eloquence.
“I thought the senator did a perfect job at articulating the Jewish mindset of public service, to always seek justice,” Taxy said. “He rightly emphasized why Jews are such an asset to our political process.”
Some students said that it was the senator’s talent for storytelling that was the greatest highlight of his speech.
“The way that he started with the anecdote about how he grew up and then fed it in to all of his other experiences and beliefs, it kept bringing us back to the original topic,” said Amanda Kantor, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “It effectively connected his faith everything that he does day to day as a senator.”

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science will offer the Writing 150 course in the fall semester 2013, which will be part of new general education requirements.
The restructuring of the new general education curriculum will include two additional category requirements, a broader scope of class offerings and smaller seminar-style classes, Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs who has been working on restructuring the GE system, said.
The new general education program, which is slated to be fully implemented by the fall semester of 2015, will increase the six categories of subjects to a total of eight required cateogories.Students will be required to take a course in the arts and in quantitative reasoning.
In addition, the university will offer Writing 150, a stand-alone thematic course. This course, unlike the current requirement Writing 140, will not require students to be dually enrolled in a social issues course. Lamy, who is also a professor of international relations, said these courses will be offered as early as fall 2013.
All first-year students will be required to take a freshman seminar. These smaller classes will fulfill one of the eight category requirements while providing new students with a more intimate class experience.
Lamy said the idea is modeled off of courses for Thematic Option, the university’s core general education honors program, because the university received positive reviews on end-of-the-semester surveys about the program.
“The students, when they come right through the door, would have the opportunity to do their GEs in a small, seminar environment,” Lamy said,
Lamy noted that while the university is adding more seminars to its program, other universities are cutting back on the amount of seminars they offer.
Some students point out that more categories would result in an increase in the number of units one has to take, which would be a potential problem for incoming students who want to pursue multiple major-minor combinations.
“Fitting in general education units with my Spanish and pre-med courses has been manageable, but if there were more categories added on, it would be problematic,” said Julianna Paul, a freshman majoring in Spanish.
However, Lamy and Gene Bickers, the vice provost for undergraduate programs and professor of physics and astronomy who has been working on the restructuring as well, said they are working hard to ensure that more general education courses can fulfill major requirements.
Lamy and Bickers said they are working to improve the extensiveness of the general education courses offered with the hope that students will be purposeful in selecting courses that compliment their chosen academic disciplines while giving them balance.
“We’d like students to be thoughtful in how they chose their GEs. We want to give them the option to take courses that will work well with their disciplines,” Bickers said.
The renovation of the general education system presents many challenges to curriculum planners, such as accommodating the logistics of additional smaller classes. The program will also accommodate transfer students who wish to fulfill their GEs with courses taken at other universities.
Planners said providing a holistic curriculum to all university graduates is one of their most important goals.
“Many of our students study technical fields — they study business, they study professional areas — but we think it’s key that they also be grounded in the liberal arts,” Bickers said.
Lamy insists that the changes are coming from a place of improvement rather than repair.
“We’re not addressing flaws. We’re trying to make it as innovative as possible. We’re trying to increase the depth and breadth of courses and really take advantage of all the assets USC has to offer,” Lamy said.
Some students were not as optimistic about the benefits of the changes to the general education system. Daniel Kim, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said the restructuring would alter the way students approach the way they select their classes.
“I think it creates less flexibility for students because a lot of people want to take classes that aren’t really major classes or GE classes … and I feel like if you add more GEs, that takes away that flexibility,” Kim said.
Despite the varied reactions, Undergraduate Student Government Academic Affairs Director Andres Guarnizo-Ospina said he is positive about the new GE proposal.
“I think it’s a great program and there has been a correlation between general education getting better and USC rising in rankings,” Guarnizo-Ospina said. “I think there’s always room to improve and evolve for a changing student population and changing student interests. Fortunately, USC is very flexible and can keep up. I think it’s going to keep evolving for the better.”
Thank You for trying to waste more of our money, if this passes i bet less future alumni with donate money and future applicants will begin to consider lower ranked schools where they can focus on getting the education they want and not waste time in these already poorly made classes so that random professors could feel important.
The current GE system is already superfluous in that it forces students to take classes that may not be of particular interest to students.  But this is not the problem (all students will encounter classes that they dislike). The actual problem here is that the current GE system takes the equivalent of 1.5 semesters to complete. That will cost each student an extra $30,000 on average to take classes they don’t like!! It is another way for USC to reach into our pockets and take our money. Now imagine when the GE system is restructured to require EIGHT classes! Get your checkbooks out and be prepared to sit through more stale classes that will make you wonder why you’re paying $40,000/year for tuition to take classes unrelated to your major.

With all of the buzz surrounding new fiction releases such as Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life and upcoming titles such as Dan Brown’s Inferno, it’s easy to lose track of another important facet of the literary world: nonfiction.
Though debates about the values of nonfiction and fiction have yielded no concrete results — it’s nearly impossible to tell which genre is more popular — it’s undeniable that nonfiction makes up a significant chunk of modern literature.
The start of this year alone has seen the likes of Maya Angelou’s Mom & Me & Mom, Debbie Reynolds’ Unsinkable: A Memoir and Sheryl Sandberg’s controversial book on women in the workplace, Lean In. If you’re perusing Barnes & Noble’s latest or just walking down the terminal at LAX, you’re sure to find an author’s moody face leering down at you from the shelves.
Admittedly, discussing nonfiction as a single genre is nearly impossible. Just as fiction harbors subcategories such as romance, fantasy and science fiction, the term “nonfiction” can be applied to anything ranging from biography to travel writing to self-help — and sometimes, the lines can get somewhat muddled.
But no matter what nonfiction titles catch our attention, there’s no denying that there’s something inherently intriguing about getting the so-called “truth” of an author’s story. Somehow, when we’re reading heartbreaking tales of failed marriages, criminal proceedings and controversial science experiments, we take particular pleasure in knowing that the writer has experienced these occurrences firsthand.
Just take a look at James Frey’s A Million Little Pieces fiasco. Frey’s memoir supposedly told the true story of his drug addiction and subsequent struggle for rehabilitation — until an extensive investigative article by The Smoking Gun revealed that the memoir contained more fiction than fact. By the time the news broke that Frey had dramatized some components of the story, such as the length of time he was in jail and the nature of a fellow addict’s suicide, the book had already sold more than 3.5 million copies and landed a spot on The New York Times bestseller list. Supposedly, Frey labeled the story as “nonfiction” in order to find a publisher.
“I think one of the coping mechanisms I developed was sort of this image of myself that was … greater than what I actually was,” said Frey in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. “In order to get through the experience of the addiction, I thought of myself as being tougher than I was and badder than I was — and it helped me cope.”
Still, despite Frey’s rationale, the reaction to the deception was explosive. Fans demanded refunds. Oprah grilled Frey on national television. Major booksellers re-shelved the book as fiction. The literary community quickly faced the question: How are we supposed to treat nonfiction?
“I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require,” Frey said in the “note to the reader” that was published in later editions of A Million Little Pieces. “I altered events and details all the way through the book.”
The debacle surrounding A Million Little Pieces has since died down, but Frey’s name, unfortunately, is still synonymous with “liar” in the literary world. Still, why do we assume that a story has to be “true” in order to be authentic?
Perhaps it’s because we enjoy knowing that our own lives still contain an element of drama — even without an author’s fictional embellishments. Elizabeth Gilbert’s quest for inner peace in Eat, Pray, Love solidified her standing as one of the greatest contemporary American writers and earned a 2010 theatrical release starring Julia Roberts. Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs shot to the top of bestseller lists as it offered readers a snapshot into the life of the head of Apple Inc. Angelou has published six autobiographies, all of which met with fantastic critical success.
“Words mean more than what is set down on paper,” writes Angelou in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. “It takes the human voice to infuse them with shades of deeper meaning.”
Apparently, it’s better if that “deeper shade of meaning” is also grounded in reality.
But there’s also another element behind our fascination with nonfiction: Sometimes even our imaginations fail us when it comes to documenting the horrors and triumphs of everyday life.
Rebecca Skloot, for example, shot to instant literary fame with her 2010 The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. The book, which falls into the biography and bioethics categories, explores the mystery behind Henrietta Lacks. Lacks’ cancer cells were taken without her permission in 1951 and used to make medical breakthroughs in leukemia, Parkinson’s disease and hemophilia, among other diseases. Before Skloot’s investigative work, however, very little was known about Henrietta’s life.
Skloot, who will be giving a lecture on The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks today at 4 p.m. at the Health Sciences Campus’ Mayer Auditorium, attributes most of the book’s success to the miracle of Henrietta’s narrative.
“I think people are reacting to the book the way I reacted to the story,” said Skloot in an interview with The Oregonian. “I think a lot of it is the power of the story.”
Knowing that there are so many stories that haven’t been told intrigues us. For whatever reason, we enjoy reading about the daring exploits of our human heroes or the striking untold narrative of a woman who just happened to need a pelvic exam.
Nonfiction, it seems, still captivates us — even without the brilliance of an author’s imagined world.

Tucked away next to legendary ramen shop Daikokuya is Little Tokyo’s newest udon restaurant, Marugame Monzo. During cold Los Angeles nights, a bowl of fresh, hot udon hits the spot.
Artisan noodles · A Monzo chef rolls out dough for Monzo’s signature hand-Zmade udon, made from a mix of Japanese wheat, flour and water. — Kalai Chik | Daily Trojan
Instead of settling for a cup of instant ramen, head over to Monzo for a variety of fusion, traditional hot or cold handmade noodles.
Unlike the new variety of ramen shops, Monzo not only provides an Eastern, calming ambiance but also includes an open kitchen where customers can watch skilled noodle artisans make udon.
Using only the freshest ingredients, Monzo offers hungry customers the finest quality Japanese food and toppings. One big draw? Monzo recreates udon dishes served in Tokyo so perfectly that a customer can taste the authenticity; it’s a quality shown especially in Monzo’s aburaage (fried) tofu.
Even though Monzo is more expensive than some other noodle restaurants in Little Tokyo, it also offers a larger selection of traditional and fusion food. The range of food within the menu caters to vegetarians, fusion foodies and people with big appetites alike.
For customers who want only noodles and toppings, there is a soupless udon menu. For customers who would like a healthy alternative, there is a salad udon menu. And for customers who prefer smaller dishes over noodles, there is also a menu for skewers, salads and rice.
Monzo’s menu is as creative as the hip customers who often come in for a bite. Its “signature udon,” for one, is a combination of creamy pasta sauce with hot, thick udon noodles. Another popular udon comes with the mentai squid butter, standing out as a delicious, buttery fusion udon combined with delectable slivers of squid.
Most customers, however, order from the hot udon menu, which includes the popular duck nanban udon, a hot udon garnished with slices of duck meat. The cold udon options are a great choice during for sticky summertime. As for appetizers, the waitstaff recommends the beef tataki, thin slices of medium-rare beef that’s been seasoned and marinated. There are also two bigger ticket items: the Japanese cheese fondue and udon suki (hot pot), which need to be ordered in advance. At around $30, both items are the most expensive on the appetizer menu (which typically hovers around $7 a side dish). But, rest assured, the other items on the appetizer menu are not nearly as expensive. For the average customer, one bowl of udon with a side order easily makes a full meal.
Though the restaurant is a new contender in Los Angeles’ noodle race, Monzo has been well received by many customers since its opening in late March. Many first-time patrons come in to try Monzo because they are curious about an alternative option to ramen, while others are returning customers who have waited a long time for an authentic udon restaurant to pop up in Little Tokyo.
This is a real, authentic udon restaurant, the first to open up in Little Tokyo in a long time. At Monzo, the broth and noodles are traditional and taste like the dishes obaachan (grandma)would  prepare.
Still,  there is a Western approach to the food on the menu, which makes it appeal to both ethnic Japanese and Westerners alike.
For those interested in trying handmade udon, Monzo is the place to go. A bowl with minimal toppings, costs between $7 to $13, so this isn’t the cheapest udon place for a college student on a budget. But — if it’s a Friday night and your friends are hungry for some hot udon, Monzo is definitely worth checking out.
 
Monzo is open for lunch from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and for dinner from 5 to 10 p.m.. It is currently closed on Mondays.

One of the biggest and most diverse event produced by students is almost here. The Black Student Assembly, Concerts Committee and Program Board have worked alongside each other for months for the combined BSA Gearfest and Springfest event this Saturday, an event that will provide a musically and culturally diverse environment for USC to enjoy.
“Collaborating with Springfest has allowed both of our executive teams to create something bigger than us,” said Brittany Jenkins, one of the producers of this year’s Gearfest and a junior majoring in business administration. “Combining these events definitely has the potential to create a staple event at USC that will be internationally recognized, and I am glad to just be a part of it.”
With new ideas and extensive student involvement, the director and producers of both events are able to maximize the potential for their respective events.
“Lamar [Gary], the BSA director, and I actually wanted to do this from the very beginning, since October,” said Bryan Leong, the director of Concerts Committee and a senior majoring in business administration. “One of the big benefits of Springfest, they get to bring out of a lot of people in the day time. … This year, we are expecting up to 1,000. … The main benefit of Springfest is the increase in daytime attendance, and for Gearfest is that they can get much bigger talent than they have ever had in the past.”
Gearfest is a one-day festival that showcases emerging designers and musicians from the Los Angeles area. This year’s theme “Dreamin’ of Destiny” was envisioned by Gearfest Creative Director Alanah Joseph, a senior majoring in communication.
“This season reinvents our classic childhood fairy tales by shedding light on the heroine, a woman that is powerful, beautiful and adventure-seeking,” Joseph said. “Taking inspiration from women movements in the 16th century and Gothic novels, female bodies are adorned with designs that show that elegance and sex appeal are not mutually exclusive.”
To demonstrate this, designers have created pieces that are dangerously elegant. However, the story of reinvention expressed by more than just the pieces. “Dreamin’ of Destiny” focuses on the broader theme of fulfilling goals.
“What we have created now is a fashion-music culture where, on the professional side, students can place themselves in a professional setting and grow from the experience of planning Gearfest. On the social and spectator side, Gearfest is a culture that brings everyone together, and it showcases what we are capable of doing as a people,” Jenkin said.
Springfest, a one-day event, but it focuses more on musical talent. This year looks to also bring the USC community together while highlighting diversity in the music industry.
Leong highlights the diversity students and guests will have to look forward to this year.
“Typically, in past Springfests, we have only focused on one very big headliner. … This year, we wanted to make it more festival-like. We wanted to show that we have a more diverse range of music to show,” Leong said.
Springfest is centered on four genres: hip hop, electronic dance music, rock music and indie music.
“This year we want to focus on all genres of music. We want the indie lovers to appreciate and see what hip-hop concerts are all about and vise versa. We want the USC community to experience the different types of music and that’s the main focus. … We have special events at USC, BSA, Trojan Pride,  the Academic Cultural Assembly and a lot more other organizations that will make this a bigger event,” said Leong.
For Gearfest, it’s ultimately about fashion, music and culture. But one concept stands out among the others.
“This is more than a fashion show and concert,” Jenkin said. “Gearfest serves as a platform for African-American students to show the community we are more than athletes and scholars. We are bosses, executives, creators, innovators, visionaries, originators and leaders.”
One of the main goals behind both events was to further student involvement. Both showcases will not only feature student performers but also incorporate students from various departments at USC.
Together, Springfest and Gearfest strive to give the USC community a sense of diversity and unity and create a tradition that will continue for years to come.

Collegiate women should not count out the possibility of finding their mates in college for the sake of their careers.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Titled “Advice for the young women of Princeton: the daughters I never had,” the article urged female Princeton students to find husbands during their four years in college.
“When I was an undergraduate in the mid-seventies, the 200 pioneer women in my class would talk about navigating the virile plains of Princeton as a precursor to professional success,” Patton wrote. “Never being one to shy away from expressing an unpopular opinion, I said that I wanted to get married and have children. It was seen as heresy.”
Patton’s words seem to have opened up a Pandora’s box of sorts for the feminist community. Women have spent hundreds of years fighting for equal rights: suffrage, to be paid wages equal to those earned by men and to be hired for intellectually demanding jobs.
And, at some time during that struggle, a divide has been placed between those women who wish to work, those who want to have families and those who are attempting to balance it all.
A couple of weeks ago, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg made the media rounds to support the release of her book, Lean In. The book, a discussion about balancing home and work for women, sparked controversy. Here is a successful woman who manages to get home in time to cook dinner for her children. Revolutionary.
Compared to Sandberg, Patton seems like a woman stuck in the ’50s. One is asking women to kick ass in both home and work while another is saying things such as “Here’s what nobody is telling you: Find a husband on campus before you graduate.”
On the surface, Patton’s words just appear to be those of an older generation or someone who is unaware of the strides women have taken in the past few decades.
No matter how ridiculous the article might sound, however, the themes that she touches on ring true.
It’s a beautiful thing that women outnumber men in colleges by the droves. It’s a beautiful thing that more women are in the workforce than ever. But, once women have worked hard through their 20s, many are left with a very loaded question: Why can’t I find someone to marry?
Success can seem like nothing if you have no one to share it with. “For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you,” Patton wrote.
Patton’s words are a bit dramatic — there is obviously a good chance of one finding a mate long after her college years are behind her. But what Patton is attempting to say through some unfortunate and out-of-date vernacular is that a woman’s chance of successfully finding a match might be higher during her college years than when the field opens up significantly in the real world. Patton is basically asking: Why wade through the trouble of finding your soulmate in a field of millions instead of those on your own college campus?
“Worthy” is perhaps the wrong word, but Patton has the right idea. Women often sacrifice true romantic happiness, which is rooted in compatibility, for the sake of settling down. Some women rush into relationships and marriages because their biological clocks are ticking and it’s the best that they can come up with.
Patton isn’t saying that you must find a partner in college for the sake of happiness, she’s simply advising for girls not to count it out. By ignoring people on campus in order to concentrate on their careers, women are potentially missing out on the loves of their lives.
True feminism isn’t about working all the time or even having both a family and a job. It’s about empowering women to think and feel the way that they want to. Ironically, attacking Patton because of her thoughts and feelings is the true setback.
We should all be able to live our lives the way that we want to. If that means focusing on our careers, so be it. If that means getting married right after graduation, so be it.
Just don’t complain when things don’t go your way.
Sheridan Watson is a junior majoring in critical studies. She is also the Editorial Director of the  Daily Trojan.
 
Women should not be pressured to find a partner in college, as emotional needs are different for each individual.
A letter published in the Daily Princetonian, the student-run newspaper at Princeton University, advised women at Princeton to find a husband while in school — a suggestion that might sound ridiculous in the year 2013. The writer, ’77 Princeton alumna Susan Patton, has gotten national attention for this letter because it represents a view many see as ‘anti-feminist’.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Though Patton’s argument that women ought to look for life partners in college is problematic in itself, it must be noted that she has the right to her own opinion, because that right to her own opinion is what feminism’s all about.
That being said, the idea that women alone must bear the burden of selecting a husband who is going to meet their expectations is absurd.
Women should not feel like they have to find a husband in college, or ever. This is something Patton made clear in a second op-ed published in the Huffington Post on Monday.
What isn’t clear, however, is why she places this burden on women, but not on men.
She has a point: Dating in college can be easier than in the ‘real world’. Undergraduate students at schools such as Princeton or USC are carefully selected and possess ambition and intelligence that set them apart. Instead of having to determine whether or not someone has similar goals or values, the fact that someone is a fellow student generally shows they have these traits.
But women should not feel like they have to find their partner by the age of 22, nor should men, or lesbian or gay or bisexual students. Yes, if two people decide they want to get married right out of, in or before college, that’s up to them. The fact of the matter is that such a decision is reached by two people, not one.
What’s fundamentally off about Patton’s letter is that she assumes men will choose women based on their age and looks while women will choose men based primarily on their intellect. This trend is something researchers have acknowledged and have attempted to pass off as a product of evolution — ignoring the fact that social behaviors vary widely in other cultures and is probably only grounded in our own ideas about the world and reinforced by a network of media and tradition.
Maybe this letter falls under the category of “practical advice for this day and age,” but that sort of advice does little to help the problem Patton identifies: smart women having a hard time finding partners who can keep up with them.
The thing is, no two people are exactly alike, which is what makes relationships challenging and interesting. People have strengths and weaknesses that can’t necessarily be measured by an IQ score or diploma. Yes, attendance at a top university can indicate certain things about a person’s intelligence, personal values and ability to work hard, but that is not the sole value of another human being.
The letter even enforces this misguided viewpoint by metaphorically commodifying women: “As Princeton women, we have almost priced ourselves out of the market. Simply put, there is a very limited population of men who are as smart or smarter than we are.”
It’s not news that someone at Princeton is going to be elitist about being from Princeton. Still, her letter is addressed to women, not men. If people should marry partners with roughly similar intellects — which isn’t necessarily a bad idea — the burden is on both men and women to find someone who can make them happy.
Smart women should not feel as though they must marry someone who is smarter than them. In fact, smart women should not feel as though they must marry anyone with any certain quality, nor should stupid women, or smart men or stupid men.
Though Patton means well with her article, and her advice might apply to some like-minded women at her alma mater, one can hope that Trojans know their time as undergraduates is only the beginning of their adult lives. It’s a time students can push themselves intellectually and socially and, if it’s a priority, find someone to share their life with.
But women don’t have to find a husband and men don’t have to find a wife. No one should look at their college years as the only time to meet interesting, intelligent people.

Rachel that does sounds equally preachy: “In fact, smart women should not feel as though they must marry anyone with any certain quality…”

I’ve spent a large portion of my life searching for a forum through which I can unleash my biased and irrational opinions on the sports world. Thanks to the Daily Trojan, I now have that medium. You might disagree with my views, but I’ll do my best to keep my personal biases out of my writing. Now, without further ado, I present my guide to the 2013 Major League Baseball season.
This season already promises to be one of the best we’ve seen in recent memory. Last year, we saw a major power shift take place in nearly every division. Three years ago, who would have thought that Oakland, Baltimore and Washington would be finding themselves in the playoffs? More importantly, who would have guessed that the Boston Red Sox would be losing 93 games while the San Francisco Giants would be starting a ring collection, winning two championships in three years.
The make-up of the league has changed dramatically, and we are now seeing the perennial superpowers of the ‘00s being replaced by young, disciplined teams who play the game the right way.
There is no question that the Washington Nationals are the best team in the league. They are a lock for a championship. Their pitching rotation appears to be unstoppable, and young gun Bryce Harper has plenty to prove this year. I see the Nationals running up against the Los Angeles Angels in the World Series and taking them down in six games.
As for the rest of the National League, I see both the Giants and Cincinnati Reds successfully defending their division crowns while the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers take the two wild card spots.
The situation is almost completely opposite in the American League. A number of questions have been raised with the construction of All-Star-packed Toronto Blue Jays and Angels squads. While I trust that Angels manager Mike Scioscia can handle the star power that he’s inherited, I cannot say the same for Toronto. Many other teams in the past, like the Dodgers and Miami Marlins, have built teams with this same model and failed.
The Blue Jays make the AL East a total toss-up, but when all is said and done, the Tampa Bay Rays are going to find themselves on top by at least five games. The Central race will be boring, with the Detroit Tigers taking the division with ease, while the West will be all Angels. The A’s and Blue Jays will both just barely take the Wild Card spots to fill out the playoff picture. The Angels will work their way to the World Series with ease, only to be taken down by overpowering pitching from the Nationals
All in all, it promises to be another fun season as we get to watch the new blood like Harper and Mike Trout replace some of MLB’s fading stars.

This weekend kicks off the “season of plays” at USC; from now until the end of the semester, there will be at least two productions every week, with some weeks having as many as four different productions! This weekend brings us to the School of Dramatic Arts official performances. Both are period pieces that deal with drama, families and friendships, but in very different ways.
“Broken Eggs” by Eduardo Machado tells the story of the Marquez family on the daughter’s wedding day. Lisette has landed a nice Jewish boy, but her family is still plagued by their Cuban past.  As they struggle to come to terms with their heritage, the family must evaluate their relationships, often in explosive ways. Addiction, prejudice and painful memories remain an active part of these people’s lives. The play weaves humor and biting drama to narrate the lives of this family and  the struggles of immigration and integration.
The show is directed by an outside professional, Laurie Woolery. She regularly works throughout Los Angeles, but this is her first production at USC. “Broken Eggs” stars 10 talented theater students from all grades. The show runs this weekend only in the Scene Dock Theater.
This weekend also kicks off the two-week run of “The Most Happy Fella,” the annual SDA all-school musical. This is the “big show” of the spring—used as a promotional tool by SDA for donors and admitted students. This show has it all: beautiful set, extremely talented cast, and spectacular music. Written by Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls, How to Succeed in Business) the show was nominated for numerous Tony Awards when it opened in 1956.
“The Most Happy Fella” tells the story of Tony Esposito and the waitress Rosabella. Tony sees Rosabella at a restaurant in San Francisco and writes her a note, insisting she writes back. The two begin a  pen-pal relationship, and eventually Rosabella joins Tony in the Napa Valley to marry him. She doesn’t realize however, that Tony has not been entirely honest about his identity. Rosabella is suddenly faced with a tumultuous drama of disappointment, sudden passion and love.
This musical could almost be called an opera, as most of the show is sung-through. It features notable songs such as “Standing on the Corner,” “Somebody Somewhere,” “Big D,” and the title song. Three of the leads, Cole Cuomo, Kimberly Hessler and Haley Fletcher, are all vocal-performance majors, a fact which greatly contributes to the music of the show. Their vocal talent is extremely apparent, and their acting chops aren’t too shabby either.
“The Most Happy Fella,” runs April 4-14 at the Bing Theater. Tickets for both shows are currently available at the ticket office.

Squash blossoms and ricotta on sourdough, please.
Have you ever tried sourdough? You probably have, right? How about pizza with a sourdough crust? If that sounds intriguing to you, you can get your fix at Wildcraft Sourdough Pizza in Culver City.
The hip new eatery, which recently opened in downtown Culver City, is a laid-back space with great service and awesomely unique food. Urban accents such as brightly colored graffiti art on the wall liven up the industrial decor of the casual chic restaurant. The decor combination is as unique as some of its menu items, as Wildcraft is known for its Neapolitan pizzas. The pizzeria even has 16 beers on tap to wash down those pies.
The Burrata Pie spares no attention to detail, incorporating carefully conceived elements including fried rosemary. — Tanaya Ghosh | Daily Trojan
Speaking of pies, Wildcraft has plenty of unique offerings including the “Burrata Pie,” which is composed of squash blossom, fried rosemary, shaved pistachio, orange oil and burrata, a fresh mozzarella cheese filled with cream. This all makes for a heavenly combination, as the creamy burrata and fragrant rosemary mingle with the citrus and the crunch of the shaved pistachio. All of this sits atop the soft, chewy and slightly crispy sourdough crust, which is filled with air pockets. The tangy sourdough complements the sweetness of the burrata. Combined with the aromatic power of fried herbs, these indulgent and uniquely complementary ingredients make the Burrata Pie one of my favorites on the menu.
If squash blossoms don’t float your boat, you can try other adventurous pies such as the “Clam & Pork,” or the “Carbonara,” which has pork belly and a cracked soft egg. For pizza-lovers who are feeling less avant garde, you can always stick to more classic flavors like “The O.G.,” which consists of tomato, mozzarella, garlic and basil. You really can’t go wrong!
Wildcraft Pizza also offers appetizers such as tuna crudo (an Italian-style sashimi) and arancini (fried balls of risotto served with smoked mozzarella and marinara), as well as desserts, such as salted caramel budino, a rich Italian pudding and “sour dough nuts,” a sourdough-twist on traditional doughnuts dusted with cinnamon and served with a mixed berry sauce. A satisfying meal, from start to finish!
For more information on Wildcraft Sourdough Pizza, you can check them out at wildcraftpizza.com.
What are your thoughts on squash blossoms and sourdough crusts? Stay tuned for another foodie find next Tuesday, right here at Tanaya’s Table. Feel free to tweet me at @TanayaG!
