Content warning: This article contains discussions of sexual assault, violence and suicide.
On Jan. 4, the Times of Israel published a lengthy investigative piece alleging that Ukrainian women were being systematically raped, abused and exploited under the “willful ignorance” of Israeli authorities: Women were raped by the very men who had gotten them out of Ukraine, the exposé alleged. Even with substantiated evidence of the violations, women have reportedly been met with dismissal and disbelief from Israeli authorities. Financial distress gripped them, the Times reported, as the Israeli government prohibited them from finding work. Desperation drove them to suicide or to exploitative jobs which they now couldn’t leave under threat of violence.
In the grand scheme of Twitter — the “digital town square,” according to a certain billionaire who now owns it — there has been a single viral tweet about this article that received a decent amount of attention. “If this was done in an Official Enemy country it would be non-stop headline news in the West,” the tweet read. And to some degree I found this true. 
While it is unfortunately reasonable to infer that women are vulnerable to sexual violence in times of war, their stories are still newsworthy whenever they are brought to light. And yet, as it did for many others, it took me 11 days to become aware of such a large-scale investigation, no less by a publication with a reputation for its sympathy to Zionism.
When Israel announced back in March it would grant temporary status to 25,000 Ukrainians, it proudly proclaimed that “Israel is expected to be one of the world’s leading countries of destination and refuge for Ukrainian citizens fleeing the war.” Just under a year later, the Times piece reported that 32,000 of the 47,000 Ukrainians, most of them women, who have fled to Israel since the start of the invasion have chosen to leave. The irony is palpable.
Furthermore, where is the anger from the major outlets, either here in the U.S. or otherwise? Sky News, ABC News, the New York Times, NPR and countless others have eagerly covered the extensive reports of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers against women in Ukraine — equally horrid and bloodcurdling. But I ask again, where is the anger when Israeli men commit these same atrocities; and where is the anger for the state that allows the violence to continue without sanction? Or do we only cover women’s suffering when it benefits a political narrative?
But I’d like to stop myself, and potentially you, the reader, here for a moment. The slope of asking, “Why aren’t the media talking about this?” is incredibly slippery. We need only look at the discourse surrounding Saturday’s mass shooting at a dance hall in Monterey Park that killed 11 people. Canadian actor Simu Liu tweeted Sunday that the incident “should be getting way more coverage in media” — all while the Associated Press, the New York Times, the Washington Post and even the Wall Street Journal ran live updates feeds on their respective websites and mobile apps, as well as breaking news notifications to subscribers’ mobile devices. The Los Angeles Times ran a constantly updated news article with an 11-writer byline, an op-ed and an editorial on the subject — all in the last 48 hours.
More rare, however, are discussions about how such violence would affect Asian communities — more difficult and nuanced, perhaps, because the suspect himself was Asian. And maybe that’s what Liu meant when he said the shooting “should be getting way more coverage.” When we ask ourselves a similar question, we should re-evaluate exactly what we mean by that. Even in a well-covered event, what isn’t being discussed? What’s being left out, and why? Without that crucial step of critical thinking, the path to conspiracy and bigotry is clear-cut. And we have more than enough of that already.

Recently, after an otherwise humorous Twitter brawl with climate activist Greta Thunberg, the infamous Andrew Tate was arrested in Romania on charges of human trafficking and rape.
Disappointing, but not at all surprising given Tate’s track record.
For those unfamiliar, Tate remains one of the most openly misogynistic individuals permeating the internet space, spewing sexist, outdated rhetoric to a growing audience of (particularly young) individuals. Tate once said, “You can’t be responsible for something that doesn’t listen to you. You can’t be responsible for a dog if it doesn’t obey you, or a child if it doesn’t obey you, or a woman that doesn’t obey you.”
While he began his career as a professional kickboxer, his prominence was derived primarily from his hypermasculine, misogynistic and often homophobic messages geared toward young men. His messages don’t just end with the infantilization and dehumanization of women. Luckily, he’s now stuck in prison. Right?
While his arrest may then be a reason to celebrate, especially given the context of his egregious crimes, we shouldn’t become complacent. Though Tate is currently locked up and unable to produce content brimming with misogynistic takes, his rise in popularity may at least be partly attributed to the fact that his message catered to the incessant, underlying misogyny that stubbornly persists in many individuals and implicitly within society.
When examining Tate’s audience and their undying loyalty to the fandom, it becomes hard to believe that Tate converted his followers to become anti-woman without there already existing a bedrock of hatred. Many individuals can easily identify the fallacious logics used by Tate to justify his bigotry, making most of his arguments uncompelling. As a result, a good portion of his followers likely held some degree of chauvinism before Tate came along, coaxing their male fragility with his aggressive message. 
The space Tate occupied, often called the “manosphere” (loosely defined as an online space that promotes anti-feminist ideology), has long existed prior to Tate. However, his belligerent messages advocating for violence against women may have provoked underlying misogyny to the forefront of the group’s ideals. When empowered to spew their hatred so freely and publicly, individuals like Tate serve as the catalyst that causes an ideology to manifest as physical violence against vulnerable groups.
Tate’s supporters have already protested for his release in Greece, with a viral video depicting a swarm of an all-male group chanting “free Top G.” The video can be seen as a slap in the face to all the women who wish to be treated equally, though that’s probably what the group wanted in the first place. 
To prevent individuals like Tate from becoming prominent influencers affecting the empathy of the next generation, our society should examine the radical right response that came with the progressive societal movements aimed at uplifting marginalized groups. For the radical right, Tate’s outspoken and overconfident persona aimed at dismantling said progression stemmed from a place of insecurity and male fragility. While feminism most definitely does not entail the destruction of traditional masculinity, individuals like Tate appear to interpret it as such. 
Educating our youth on equality starting from a young age may be part of the larger solution to the damaging gendered schism Tate has caused. By encouraging honest displays of empathy and emotion in our young men, we can provide a healthier outlet for boys’ mental health rather than teaching them to associate emotions with weakness — a message Tate often spews to his audience. 
According to Tate, “You feel sad, you move on. You will always be depressed if your life is depressing.” Easier said than done, to say the least. Not only is suicide the twelfth leading cause of death overall in the United States according to the National Institute of Mental Health, MRI scans and genetic screenings have shown physical abnormalities within the brain that impact cognitive functioning.
The phenomenon of Andrew Tate should be terrifying to all, and if his message has yet to phase you, you may want to ask yourself what parts of his bigotry speak to your soul. Women are not the enemy to men, like Tate implies; his flagrant and obsessive hatred for women reveals more about his own insecurities and patriarchal brainwashing than anything else. 
Like a fire, misogyny grows slowly but surely, when gone unchecked, affects every surface of our green earth. In this case, Tate is the gasoline that could be the downfall of our burning land of egalitarianism, if any is even left over.

When Trojans step foot onto the newly renamed Allyson Felix Field, they’ll be entering the legacy of the most decorated U.S. track Olympian. The alum has led a life of advocacy work in women’s rights, maternity rights and issues facing athletes of color. 
Felix graduated from USC in 2008, however, she did not race for the University. 
Previously named after former track coach and self-professed anti-Semitic Dean Cromwell, Allyson Felix Field sits at the center of the Katherine B. Loker Stadium on campus. The track is the central hub for both the men and women’s track and field teams, as well as the Trojan Marching Band.
The Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media sat down for an interview with Allyson Felix Monday as she reflected on her retirement from running and looked ahead to the future.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: How has your time at USC influenced your approach to your athletic career and advocacy work? 
Allyson Felix: It gave me a really great foundation. I constantly come back to some of the things I learned at SC. The atmosphere of other students, and what they were pursuing, and just an environment where people are chasing after greatness — for me, that really pushed me to go beyond the limits, and to really think things through. 
Annenberg Media: You have done so much advocacy for female athletes, athletes of color, mothers, working mothers. How do you hope to inspire USC’s female athletes of color, who you’ve pretty much advocated for your whole career?
AF: I hope they’re inspired to think outside of the box, and not accept things just for the way they are, but instead think through them. I hope that generation experiences things differently. I hope that they don’t have to really think twice about things.
Obviously, student athletes are at school to get a great education and also fulfill their potential in sports. But I think what we’re seeing for athletes right now is that we’re interested in what they have to say, and what they think on other things, as well. And so I hope they feel empowered, that their opinions matter on a vast array of things and that they can weigh in, and also understand the weight of their platform especially as they continue to grow and graduate.
DT: It can be very challenging to fight for advocacy in the face of societal pressure. How do you push on in the face of those challenges?
AF: I spent several very dark years pushing for this, pushing when the tension wasn’t on it. It’s always been what I believe in. If I deeply believe in something, then, personally, I have to commit to it and I think I just keep moving in that way. I do what I feel is right and I want to use my platform on the behalf of others.
AM: How does it feel to be a part of the process of renaming University buildings that previously honored some controversial figures?
AF: Sometimes, it’s really difficult to deal with the past, but it gives me a lot of hope that there are a lot of change-makers on the USC campus. And I think the future is just so bright, and so I’m obviously very happy that all of the renaming is happening, and that we’re being thoughtful with how that process goes, so that history doesn’t repeat itself.
DT: As you adjust to post-competition life, are there any struggles or challenges you’ve encountered?
AF: In a sense, I think I’ve been going through a grieving process, or just a loss of something I have loved for so long, and that I’ve done for the past 20 years. Although I feel super fulfilled and have so much purpose in running my company and advocating for women and all those things, change is hard. I’m excited for the future, but also just working through the realities of what transition is.

A new semester means new classes — something that I am incredibly enthusiastic about. Ever since I started school, there was nothing that excited me more than learning new things. 
What also makes these classes fun, though, is drawing new connections between things learned in class to everyday passions and happenings. One connection I never expected came from my first lecture in “Technology and International Relations” in which we discussed Ötzi, the “Iceman,” and his clothing. While his bear-fur hat, hide-lined trousers and braided grass cape were for his protection against harsh weather conditions, the tied trousers and hat are incredibly similar to the fur style boots and beanies sold today. I was surprised again, when in the following lecture, my professor explained how the precious purple dye for Tyranian purple, also known as Phoenician red, came from the shell of the murex, a sea snail. 
After class, my mind was racing on other forms of inspiration. I immediately thought of Moschino, a brand that is more obvious about its sources of inspiration, as seen in their McDonald’s, Barbie, Picasso and Paper Doll collections, perfect for their whimsical and fun brand identity and mission. 
I couldn’t help but think about other brands that are not as clear. Part of it comes from more subtle sources of inspiration — maybe stemming from architecture, classical music, cultural happenings or even the history of the brand themselves, as seen with Raf Simon’s’ debut haute couture collection as Dior’s creative director in 2012. 
Simon’s work is vastly different from uncredited designs and trends. Though, maybe my sudden increase in passion about the subject comes from my current intellectual property law class, but I think we’ve all experienced that frustration when you don’t get credit for your idea, design, etc. 
In art and fashion, this happens a lot.
A classic case is Supreme taking artist Barbara Kruger’s style for their logo, which they openly admitted. But this lack of credit applies to trends as a whole and even begins to fall into cultural appropriation. I still remember the Twitter backlash in 2018 against the girl who wore a red qipao, a traditional Chinese dress, as her prom dress, when Twitter user Jeremy Lam virally responded, “My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress.” Recently coming back into fashion due to Kim Shui’s modern takes means that there’s more cultural appreciation for qipaos, but, unfortunately, there’s also more appropriation through hypersexualized marketing and insensitive fast fashion replicas. 
Another example? Y2K as a whole. Sometimes, the inspiration for Y2K culture comes from movie clips such as Cher’s matching yellow and plaid set from “Clueless” (1995). But the low rise jeans, monograms, butterflies and even the invention of the lettuce hem all came from the Black community. 
Y2K was actually an expression of cyberpunk and excitement about the turning of the century, which is why Y2K style had so much metallic, silver and play with leather. Still, though, guess where a lot of this came from: Black artists and creatives. Although more aligned with “Afrofuturism” in the ‘70s, trends were popularized and secured into Y2K fashion history under singers like Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson and Destiny’s Child. 
Asia has a grip on beauty influences and hacks, such as the current viral way to apply foundation with a stainless steel spatula for a lightweight application, which came from Korea. What about Japan? Their glittery eyeshadow and white eyeshadow palettes used for the inner corner sparkle have finally started to get their recognition. Of course, we also can’t forget the holy grail that is now a staple in many morning routines that stems from Chinese medicine: the gua sha. 
So many other aspects of fashion don’t get the recognition they deserve. For example, door knocker earrings and hoops, first dating back to Nubia, present day Sudan, were popularized by the Latinx and Black community. Darker lip liner? Same source as the earrings. 
But the common denominator of all of the above and other popular trends is not only that credit has not been given where it is due, but also the whitewashing of them in modern street style and everyday wear. 
Even the gua sha has been whitewashed, with amethyst and rose quartz tools now being sold. Sorry, friends, but it’s not really about the stone. It is traditionally made from jade, a stone popular and imperative to Asian and Chinese culture, but the different stones for the same tool is just a creative marketing scheme for you to buy more of the same thing. 
This appropriation has brought up sensitive moments and frustration among communities of color, as stories pop up on TikTok about Hailey Bieber’s nude lip liner routine deemed “brownie glazed lips.” While Bieber is celebrated because she, a white woman, popularized the routine, Latinx and Black creators recall being bullied and called “ghetto” for the same looks.
The fox eye trend, especially the hack of cutting falsies and extending them past the eyelash line in an upwards fashion to emphasize a Bella Hadid-esque, upward eye slant created similar conversation to the “brownie glazed lips.” The Asian community can only comment on the irony of the trend taking over after their younger years also included ridicule for their natural facial features. 
Now, I’m not trying to blame Bieber or Hadid — they are public figures and influencers, whether they intend to be or not. Their actions, including makeup, lingo and fashion will be followed to a T by their loyal devotees. But it is important to remember who helped create it. 
I do appreciate that people are becoming more sensitive to cultural appropriation — it is important to not take over the trends, whether intentionally or not, and it can be a little daunting to navigate trends with cancel culture and digital footprints. But what is not difficult is simply reflecting and asking, either yourself or a third party, if you are appropriating culture. These questions should be considered: if you’re playing into a stereotype of a group of people, if what you are wearing has cultural significance, and if your wearing of clothes/execution of trend trivializes a culture. 
My advice: Be curious and do your research, but don’t be afraid. Human error is the one error that will never be cut — inevitably we will make mistakes. Just make sure that you never lose compassion and go through life with intention and an open mind. You never know what you’ll learn, and from whom.

After a weekday that’s felt a million hours long, on a day that’s highlighted by 10 p.m. classes, club meetings and a protein bar for breakfast, the only way to feel more in control is to pick up a frozen meal at Trader Joe’s and queue up something from the best movie genre — food movies. Onscreen chefs who chop vegetables at superhuman speeds are the stars that give us hope and make something mundane into a wondrous spectacle. Without further ado, here are seven movies and TV shows about food, each paired with a simple snack to give you that much-needed comfort after a brutal day.
“Julie & Julia” (2009) 
Amy Adams and Meryl Streep stand at the glorious helm of this film, bridging the gaps between the 1950’s and post-9/11 2001, Paris and New York City, and their respective idiosyncratic supportive husbands Chris Messina and Stanley Tucci. The movie immerses the viewer into a world where although things can go disastrously wrong and life can be painfully mundane, the value of a good home-cooked meal is never underappreciated. 
Trader Joe’s Quiche Lorraine is the perfect pairing with this film. Why? It’s pure warmth when straight out of the oven. Simple and French, but most importantly, laden with butter. It’s a perfect food for when you’ve come back from a long day and cooking is the last thing on your mind, yet still want to eat something that feels like it was homemade.
“Ratatouille” (2007) 
This is a generational favorite. The music, a surprisingly charming villain in the form of Anton Ego, and the lights and sounds of Paris all contribute to the legacy of “Ratatouille.” However, above all else is the food. From crackling breads and salty cheeses to glistening sauces you can almost taste, it’s the perfect movie to put on to appreciate the excitement of a good meal. 
The Charcuterie Tasting Board at Target is great with this movie. Why? The scene where Remy pairs together different combinations of ingredients as colors synthesize behind him says enough about this choice. A meal can be simple as long as it’s thoughtful and maximizes potential flavor.
“The Bear” (2022) 
This show is the sharp new kid on the block. Starring Jeremy Allen White as the neurotic fine-dining chef Carmy Berzatto with Ayo Edibiri as the whip-smart but inexperienced chef Sydney Adamu, “The Bear” details the chaotic ins and outs of running a restaurant amid personal tragedy. It’s entertaining, beautifully-shot, fast-paced and tense while hiding a glowing undercurrent of warmth between the eccentric cooks of this Chicago restaurant. If you missed it over the summer, the awards-show hype has certainly brought it back on everyone’s must-watch lists. 
A good breakfast sandwich is an ideal pair for this show. Why? It’s quick and gets the job done. Meaty and messy, bursting at the seams with flavor. Ultimately, it’s a no-nonsense food that is sure to leave you satiated.
“The Hundred-Foot Journey” (2014) 
In this heartwarming underdog movie about a Muslim Indian family who are forced out of their successful restaurant in Mumbai and seek to rebuild their lives in the French countryside, the head chef Hassan Kadam balances delicate French cuisine and hearty Indian cooking. It’s a reminder that home can be packed in a Tupperware box and brought along on whatever hardships lie ahead of you. 
This is a bit of an unconventional choice but a food that reminds you of home is a lovely pairing for this movie. Why? College can be rough sometimes, so call up your parents or look up a recipe for your favorite food as a kid. If you have the time and the means to do so, cooking something nostalgic and filling for dinner is as close as a lot of us can get to home during the semester.
“Jiro Dreams of Sushi” (2011) 
A documentary focused on the life of 97-year-old Japanese master chef, Jiro Ono, “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” follows Ono’s journey to modernize and revolutionize sushi. It lays out his life, limitations and legacy in a way that immediately draws the audience into his former 10-seater restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro, and makes you want to book a table and experience this three Michelin starred meal in person.
The chicken gyoza at Trader Joe’s from the frozen food aisle works great with this documentary. Why? While Jiro wouldn’t necessarily appreciate the frozen food meal, as college students we realize that sometimes we have just gotta make do. All things considered, the gyoza can be steamed, pan fried or deep fried and is a delicious entrée that packs in a lot of taste into relatively small bites.
“The Menu” (2022) 
This is one of the most exciting movies on this list. While sloppy at times, and certainly darker than anything else that has been mentioned so far, “The Menu” is a treat of a film. Ralph Fiennes, as an exhausted celebrity chef, and Anya Taylor-Joy, as someone with no knowledge of this exclusive food world, have a deeply interesting push-and-pull dynamic at the heart of the film, while Nicholas Hoult as an eccentric culinary fan offers an edgy thread of comedy throughout. In this film, food is a stand-in for multiple things, but the movie never takes itself so seriously that it doesn’t turn back and assess itself as well. This is a strong contender for the best dark comedy of the year and is certainly worth a watch.
The Brookie at Trader Joe’s is as bastardized as food can get, and the shock of that simple combination is what “The Menu” offers up on a silver platter to its audience. This is a great dessert that makes you wonder why these haven’t replaced both cookies and brownies.
“Chef’s Table” (2015-2019) 
David Gelb — a USC alum! — has mastered the art of the food documentary. Cinematic classical music over slow-motion shots of the most delectable meals available in the world make “Chef’s Table” an exceptionally watchable television show. Each episode profiles a different chef around the world who is, in their own way, revolutionizing the way we look at food. This is a show that offers an escape into the window of people whose lives are centered around cooking for others, and shows you that the things important to them aren’t much different from what’s important to us.
The food pairing for this show is a Red Thai Curry with the Thai Style Red Curry Sauce at Trader Joe’s. Why? A bowl of this curry laden with vegetables over rice is the definition of comfort. The profile of a chef in the first episode of Volume 3, Jeong Kwan, a Buddhist nun in South Korea, lays out the two most incredible things that food can do: build communities and nourish our bodies. She was flown out to New York City to cook meals for private audiences at the restaurant, Le Bernadin, and returned to South Korea with no ambitions to start her own restaurant, despite no shortage of people wanting her to. 
Food can be a source of great personal joy, and food movies are the perfect place to be reminded of this. Get watching and bon appétit!

USC men’s tennis started the season strong, with the 9th-ranked Trojans sweeping Sacramento State and UC Irvine on a Sunday afternoon home doubleheader. 
In the morning, USC first faced off against Sacramento State and won with a 7-0 victory. Then, in the afternoon, the Trojans beat the Anteaters 7-0. 
The Trojans had an easy time winning the initial doubles rounds against UC Irvine. In the number 1 slot, senior Stefan Dostanic and graduate student Bradley Frye dominated Irvine senior Matthew Sah and sophomore Noah Zamora in a 6-1 match. The number 3 slot also won with a score of 6-2, with USC sophomores Ryan Colby and Karl Lee besting Irvine seniors Ali Amiri and Enrique Luque Rico. 
These two matches concluded quickly, awarding the doubles point to USC before the number 2 doubles slot finished their match. Sophomores Peter Makk and Junior Lodewijk Weststrate led 5-3 against the Anteater before their match was suspended. 
After having a solid showing in doubles, USC held their momentum to win all six of their singles matches. 
On Center Court, Dostanic targeted Zamora’s backhand and defeated the Anteater with a score of 6-1 in the first set and 6-2 in the second set. Most other Trojans also easily prevailed over UC Irvine, but two players faced challenges. 
In the number 6 slot, USC senior Samuel Rubell won the first set 6-2 against junior Thomas Smart. The score was tied 6-6 in the second set, and the match went to an intense seven-point tiebreak, where Rubell pulled through and won 7-6. 
Colby also had some trouble in his singles game. After winning the first set 6-4, he lost the second set 6-1. Then, Colby was able to pull through and win the ten-point tiebreak 10-4 with a brilliant cross-court winner on match-point. 
Despite these minor hurdles, Head Coach Brett Masi was still pleased with the Trojan’s season opener. 
“They’ve been itching to get out there and just get some different competition other than themselves,” said Masi in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I was just really happy with everything … not necessarily winning them all, but how we did it.” 
Aside from Masi, transfer sophomore Karl Lee was also thrilled with his performance, his first since transferring from UCLA. 
“The overall vibe here is just really amazing, I’m so grateful to be here,” Lee said regarding how he felt after winning his first match as a Trojan. 
Lee defeated Amiri 6-0, 6-4 and closed the match with solid net play. Coming from crosstown-rival UCLA, Lee has already contributed to the Trojan’s early season victories. 
“I came out of the gates pretty well, just feeling really solid … didn’t give him anything and then the second set, the wind started picking up,” Lee said. “I faded back a bit, and gave him some short balls … luckily, I was just disciplined enough to realize that and bring it back together.” 
Next weekend, USC will likely face UCLA at the ITA Kickoff Weekend, hosted by USC on its home court.

Sophomore guard/forward Rayah Marshall, who posted a career-high 8 blocks, led the Trojans in a dramatic overtime battle at the Alaska Airlines Arena on Sunday afternoon. The Trojans came out on top with a score of 63-54 and extended their winning streak to four games after sweeping the Washington schools.
This game was anticipated as a defense-oriented showcase for the cardinal and gold as the Trojans are leading the Pac-12 in points given up, three-point percentage defense and field-goal percentage defense before the game.
The Trojan’s offense drowned early as the team committed 3 consecutive turnovers to start the game. On the other end, the Huskies seized the opportunity and went on an early 8-0 run before graduate student guard Destiny Littleton’s mid-range jumper opened USC’s scoring column.
Marshall recorded the first of her 8 blocks on the day four minutes into the game as she denied senior forward Haley Van Dyke’s attempt in the paint. On the defensive end, Marshall ranks second in blocks per game in Pac-12 women’s basketball this season.
Turnovers were an issue for USC in the first quarter. The team turned the ball over a total of 5 times in the span of six minutes, 4 of which resulted in points for Washington.
Washington sophomore forward Dalayah Daniels found success many times when she resorted to pick-and-roll plays. Daniels shot four-for-four from the field and led her team in scoring with 8 points by the end of the first 10 minutes. Isolating the paint was untroublesome for the Huskies as they put up 16 points out of 19 total team points in the paint.
The red-shirt defense began to shine in the second quarter. Washington’s field-goal percentage deflated from 60% in the first quarter to just 22% in the second. Additionally, the Trojans controlled the paint and did not allow a single Husky point from beneath the basket in the second.
“We adjusted our ball screen coverage because they were trying to hit the rollers often, so we allowed [Marshall] to play a little bit more in space and not necessarily switch,” said Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb in a post-game interview. “I thought she was tremendous in doing that, and I think we just tried to limit their back-cuts the best that we could.”
Littleton hit a tough, moving mid-range jumper to end the first half. USC’s offense was led by Littleton with 9 points, shooting four-for-five from the field.
The second half allowed USC to focus its efforts on the offensive playbook. With 5:44 left in the third, USC went on a 7-0 run in 40 seconds, forcing a Washington timeout. Littleton’s 3-pointer, which ended the run, gave USC their first lead of the game.
The Trojans were able to maintain their lead until the beginning of the fourth quarter. Senior guard Trinity Oliver and Daniels executed a successful pick-and-roll play to bring the Huskies back on top. However, that basket ignited the Trojan defense and was followed by an almost four-minute Husky scoring drought.
Marshall ruled the paint in the fourth as she registered 5 blocks, denying the Huskies from close range. Marshall also put up a steal, an assist, 5 points and 5 rebounds in the final quarter.
The wild ending to regulation began with two missed free throws from Williams, who missed the opportunity to seal the game with 12 seconds remaining. The Huskies then drew an inbound play for their junior forward Lauren Schwartz, who hit a game-tying three despite tough defense by graduate guard/forward Okako Adika. The acrobatic 3-pointer turned the momentum towards the Huskies as they survived being down 5 points with 16 seconds left.
“This is the chance to see how tough we are mentally and physically,” Gottlieb said. “I really looked at them and said forget that, let’s do a good check on how tough we are, and I think they responded incredibly.”
The Trojans controlled overtime behind Littleton’s six straight made free throws and ended the period outscoring the Huskies 9-0.
“We had a tough stretch on the road, I think it’s more about getting back, getting recovered and getting our minds right to be road warriors for another weekend,” said Gottlieb on the team’s preparation for the upcoming games.
USC will next see action on Friday at 6 p.m. when they take on No. 9 Utah at Jon M. Huntsman Center.

Milind Gandhi was exposed to product management for the first time during his sophomore year when he took ICP 310: Designing for User Experience. He soon realized that beyond that singular Marshall class, there was no mention of the product management career path on campus.
This changed at the beginning of 2022 with the founding of ProductSC. 
Gandhi joined the club during its inception, and it provided him with a community of students aspiring to become product managers. Now a senior majoring in business administration, he serves as its president.
“In that class, I was lucky enough to stumble across product management, almost accidentally,” Gandhi said. “I got lucky, and I don’t want other people on campus to have to be as lucky to potentially find a career path that they could love and genuinely enjoy doing. I’m really glad that over the last year and a half, I’ve been able to be part of a project that’s been able to push product management to more and more people on campus.”
Product management is a role in most tech companies that lies at the intersection between business, technology and design. Product managers guide a product’s lifecycle, directing operations to convert raw materials into finished goods on the market. They also aid in resolving customer frustrations with a product and creating the most efficient path to improve user experience. 
Gandhi recognizes the importance of education and exposure when it comes to product management on campus. While other business-related career paths, such as consulting and banking, have wide exposure on campus — from classes to student organizations — product management lacks the same popularity.
“I really do think that there are a lot of people on campus who are interested [in product management] and they just need a little more exposure and education into what the role really asks for,” Gandhi said. “That’s exactly what ProductSC tries to do.” 
Through a 10-week-long introduction to product management curriculum, ProductSC educates a cohort of 40 to 50 students every semester.  The club has educated almost 200 students to date. Members interested in applying for product management internships can also opt to receive an interview preparation curriculum. 
After completing the curriculum, students engage in a case competition. Current and former product managers serve as judges, and the winning group receives a prize.
 “It’s really fun…and a good opportunity to continue learning what product management is because by actually taking on the role of one, students can understand what a product manager does better,” said Gabriela Rosenfeld, ProductSC director of curriculum.
One hundred fifty students participated in last semester’s competition. Groups consisted of five students and a mentor that guides them through the pitching process. Rosenfeld, a sophomore majoring in business administration, looks to rent out a larger space to host a much larger event this semester.
ProductSC also hosts guest speaker events featuring top product management leaders and alumni from tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, Capital One and Salesforce. These events provide students with insight into breaking into the product management industry. 
This semester, ProductSC co-director of external affairs and junior majoring in computer science and business administration Alysha Kanjiyani launched an inclusivity effort to make the speaker events open to all USC students instead of only ProductSC members.
“The general notion behind product management is very cutthroat because usually, not a lot of companies hire undergrad students,” Kanjiyani said. “I think our biggest accomplishment would be creating an environment where we help each other in such a competitive industry.” 

Correction: This article was updated at 6:22 a.m. on Jan. 30 to reflect that ProductSC’s president is Milind Gandhi, not Miland Gandhi, as a previous version stated. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

A class-action lawsuit alleges USC caused the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in retirement savings as a result of negligent administration of its Defined Contribution Retirement Plan and its Tax-Deferred Annuity Plan. While USC employees and retirees filed the suit in 2016 as part of a series of similar cases involving institutions such as Yale University, Columbia University, Brown University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Northwestern University, the eight-day bench trial starts today.
The suit alleges the University breached fiduciary duty and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by maintaining overly risky investments and excessive recordkeeping fees in its retirement plan package, going back to at least 2010. Over 30,000 employees and retirees were affected, said plaintiff attorney Jerry Schlichter.
As plan fiduciary, the University has a responsibility to make investment decisions solely in the benefit of participants. This includes maintaining reasonable administrative fees and prudent investments. Moreover, the University plan — with more than 1 billion dollars in assets — is in the largest 0.05% of contribution plans in the United States and falls under the category of a “jumbo plan.” This gives the plan “tremendous bargaining power in the marketplace” to ensure high-quality management services at a low cost, the suit states.
The lawsuit alleges the University acted for the benefit of the plan’s service providers and failed to remove funds — such as the CREF Stock Account and TIAA Real Estate Account — even though they had a history of under-performance. The suit also alleges the University failed to leverage the plan’s bargaining power to reduce administrative expenses.
USC’s investment advisors, CAPTRUST Financial Advisors,  conducted an initial analysis of the plan’s performance in 2014. The firm informed the University that three of the four active recordkeepers — including Fidelity and Vanguard — charged high recordkeeping fees, among the other conclusions and recommendations, such as which funds to keep. 
While the University followed CAPTRUST’s recommendations and removed funds that did not meet plan criteria, losses could have been prevented if a similar analysis had been conducted by at least 2009, the suit claims.
The lawsuit aims to restore all losses resulting from USC’s mismanagement and any profit the University made from the use of the plan’s assets, in addition to any other compensation the court deems appropriate.
“[Plaintiffs] are seeking compensation for those losses and the money that could have been earned if the fees had not been excessive or the investments improved,” Schlichter said. “We’re also seeking to reform the plan for the future to benefit employees going forward.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Friday, the University said it is committed to its employees and retirees.
“We are committed to supporting the retirement savings of our employees and offer a generous retirement program,” the statement read. “We look forward to telling our story at the trial.”
Various similar lawsuits that St. Louis based firm Schlichter Bogard & Denton filed in 2016 — including those against Brown, MIT and Columbia — have been settled for $3.5 million, $18.1 million and $13 million, respectively. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the Northwestern University employees and retirees the firm represented in January 2022.
Schlichter was sanctioned for $1.5 million by the U.S. District Court in Colorado in August 2022 for “recklessly pursuing” a lawsuit regarding a fiduciary breach in Great-West Capital Management’s retirement plan.
