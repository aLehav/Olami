Jinglei Xu, the award-winning Chinese director came to USC for a screening and Q&A session of her new film Go Lala Go!, at The Ray Stark Family Theatre on Friday. The theater was filled by Xu’s fans and there were still more trying to get into the event.
Xu, who has been known as a  “cai nv,” or talented woman in China, started out as an actress before moving behind the camera to make films. She is also the chief editor of the biweekly electric magazine, Kaila, which focuses on fashion and culture in everything from film and television to current events.
 Go Lala Go! won the Golden Angel Award for outstanding film in the sixth Chinese American Festival in Los Angeles on Oct. 28 2010. This is also Xu’s first mainstream film.
The film adapts the popular novel, Du Lala’s Promotion. Xu, who also stars in the movie, said she chose to adapt this novel because she wanted to try something fun and make a different film than her former works, and the novel just matched her will.
The film is about Du Lala (Xu) who gets a job at a foreign company as a white collar secretary and works her way to success. Along the way, she falls in love with the sales director of the company, Wang Wei (Stanley Huang), during the company trip to Thailand.
The only catch is that romance between co-workers is banned at the company. Soon, Lala has to keep her boss Rose (Karen Mok) from finding out about her affair, as well as figure out what is going on between Rose and Wei.
The film is overflowing with eye-catching elements, from the brightly colored designer clothes to the overwhelming advertisements. During the screening, audience members enjoyed the job of picking up every notable advertisement in the film.
The Chinese media was critical of the film, saying that the abundance of advertisements not only distracted audience attention from the film but also hurt the film’s creditability. Xu noticed the problem as well, commenting on it during the Q&A session.
“I think advertisements have both positive and negative influences to the film,” she said. “It represents the reality in Beijing. You see advertisements everywhere around the city, so instead of using [the] computer to erase those advertisements on screen, I think we can use them. So our team made contracts with a great number of advertisement investment, and it seemed out of control at the end.”
 Go Lala Go! is Xu’s fourth film. Although it was clear in Go Lala Go! that she is a capable director, she revealed that it wasn’t always the case. She took a moment to talk about her first directorial outing.
“When I directed my first film, especially for the first three days, I felt the director chair is not for me,” Xu said. “I liked photography, and I thought I knew what was going on of film shooting, but it was totally different from my thought.”
The romantic story in the film caused audiences to ask about Xu’s own romantic plans. She said that she has no plan for a relationship yet.
One aspect the film touched on was that the character of Du Lala, and Xu in real life, represent a new trend of Asian women’s value on marriage. Compared to the traditional Asian value, which encourages women to stay at home, the women, real and and fiction, show a focus on achieving the high education and the managing level job.
More and more Asian women go to business school in both their home countries and abroad, desiring to control their own life by making high achievement in their career.
At the end of the Q&A, Xu revealed that she felt that she did not do well enough on Go Lala Go! She would like to try directing another mainstream film next time, and she plans on making a film centered around an investment bank.

A study by Campusreform.org shows that USC as an institution has a liberal bias, according to its assessment of administrative policies, campus groups and faculty members.
The website determined that the liberal political bias of campus life is in part because of the disproportionate number of liberal clubs on campus. Of the 17 political clubs at USC, 11 are liberally oriented.
Micah Scheindlin, political director of USC College Democrats, said that the number of political clubs is a reflection of the political composition of the student body.
“If students are liberal these are their personal views and the number of clubs shows their excitement and beliefs,” Scheindlin said.
Campusreform.org stated that the USC faculty is also has an overwhelmingly liberal bias.
It cites that of the USC faculty and staff who donated to the 2008 presidential campaigns, 91 percent contributed to Democratic candidates — amounting to $80,548, according to Campusreform.org.
Marissa Lorion | Daily Trojan
USC faculty and staff donated only $7,933 to Republican candidates in 2008.
But Ann Crigler, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute for Politics, says that there is a difference between contributions to a party and a political candidate.
“It is not safe to necessarily draw parallels between candidates and political parties,” Crigler said.
Campusreform.org is a social networking site “to provide conservative activists with the resources,” according to its mission statement.
It has more than 14,000 affiliates on college campuses across the country, according to Abby Alger, new media manager for CampusReform.org.
“We are an online hub for conservative and libertarian organizations and offer support and outreach to student groups on college campuses,” Alger said.
Campusreform.org has eight permanent field reps, who help to start conservative and libertarian clubs on college campuses.
“We hope to restore the balance and fix the playing field, which is tilted too far to the left at the moment,“ Alger said.
Crigler cautions such evaluations of political biases on campus.
“Equating partisanship with bias is not a 100-percent foolproof way of doing it,” Crigler said. “Republicans and Democrats are not entirely different.”
Alger said, however, that such a disproportionate faculty has a negative effect on the classroom atmosphere.
“[Faculty and staff] partially skew what goes on in the classroom and there is an imbalance in political outlets and allies for conservative students on campus,” Alger said.
Crigler, however, said that universities typically tend to appear more liberal than conservative.
“If they define liberals and conservatives as ends of the spectrum and liberals as critical thinkers and developers of new ideas, then any university fits a leftist political bias,” Crigler said.
The university’s administration also expresses political bias, according to Campusreform.org, by offering courses such as Politics of Global Environment (IR 323), which emphasizes “biodiversity and global governance” and Critical Studies in Whiteness (AMST 543), which focuses on how “whiteness operates within specific racial regimes to perpetuate inequality.”
The website also said that the administration expresses a leftist political bias because it received a “red light” for violating students’ freedom of speech when controversial activist David Horowitz visited campus.
According to Crigler, such institutes as the Unruh Institute demonstrate USC’s active stance to create bipartisan discourse on campus.
“Unruh regularly hosts political discussions on campus, where political clubs conduct analyses of campaigns and policies,” Crigler said.
How satisfying to see that our great university has carved out such a transformative reputation, both culturally and intellectually.  It wasn’t very long ago that the school was besmirched with a reputation for producing corrupt Nixon administration hacks, and for being a bastion of conservative mediocrity.  What a tremendous legacy Steve Sample has left behind.  Let it not be lost on my fellow alumni that the university’s meteoric rise in reputation has coincided with it’s more balanced political atmosphere.
Come on Trojans! Let’s be above the fray and focus on what’s important and pragmatic. Let our activist, identity-politics-promoting neighbors in Westwood pump their fists in the air for–nothing–while we prevail in these tumultuous times. Who gives a damn what side we identify with?! 
Let’s not dwell on abstract arguments that lack evidence and facts.
Most of our elected officials and those who identified themselves as conservatives or liberals based on their affinity toward these politician are not critical thinkers.  If they were, our country would not be as divisive as it is today.
Critical thinkers appreciate arguments from different point of views and would not settled for name-calling as a way to suppress the opposing viewpoints.  How can we teach the young generations that name-calling is a form of bullying if the adults do not even conduct themselves in a civil manner?
I would expect (hope) that as a person becomes more educated, s/he tends to be more “open-minded” and becomes more of a critical thinker.  And this person can possess “liberal” or “conservative” beliefs (or both). 
What is lacking in many people is that they do not have the skills to think critically.  Many times they do not analyze the issues from various viewpoints and they have the tendency to be judgmental.  Did our education system failed them?
Ah, a contribution from one of our libertarian-anarchist-nihilist friends. It’s always delightful when you show up!  Thanks for reminding us that if we form an opinion and take a side on an issue, we’re not as “reasonable” as one of you “critical thinkers” whose operating principle is “Every idea is equally right, every idea is equally wrong, every conclusion is equally valid, so let’s just pretend to weigh the two options (which are equal) and pick one at random.”
Being able to make judgments and distinctions is the object of wisdom.
Thinking every idea and party is equally valid is the hallmark of ignorance.
Just because someone who is willing to listen to different viewpoints doesn’t make her/him a “libertarian-anarchist-nihilist”. 
I did not say that if people form an opinion or take side on certain issues, then they are not “reasonable”.  If their opinions are formed based on objective analysis of the hard facts (evidence from studies, historical data, and/or lessons-learned), then the side that they take is as “reasonable” as the inferences from their premises.  If their opinions are formed based on subjective views, then they can’t expect everyone to agree with them.
Joe, critical thinkers do not view “every idea is equally right, every idea is equally wrong, every conclusion is equally valid, so let’s just pretend to weigh the two options (which are equal) and pick one at random.”?  This is your opinion and I have to say that your opinion is incorrect.  Please tell me what is “right”? and what is “wrong”?  Critical thinkers would evaluate different ideas, look at all the evidence and then conclude that idea A is “better”/more “effective” solution than B, C, D, etc. because of facts (1), (2), (3), etc.  Critical thinkers would not form an opinion by saying, A is better than B, C, D, etc. because Joe tells us so and he is always “right”–for all they know, Joe may (1) be an expert and knows what he is talking about because he has  lived through different eras, has experienced different kinds of crisis, or (2) have the crystal ball that allows him to see everything, or (3) just have an illusion of knowledge.  Critical thinkers would be more willing to accept what Joe tells them if Joe is a renown expert in the field and can provide logical reasons to show how he derived at his conclusions.
Logical reasoning based on “wisdom” maybe acceptable.  However, objective evidence is essential and would bring more credibility to one’s judgments or opinions.
Recognition of ignorance fuels advancement.  Illusion of knowledge/wisdom impedes progress.
Snore. This is not news. The writer obviously wrote this piece as a thinly veiled plea for conservatives to become more outspoken at USC. Is this op-ed or hard news? Look at the discussion that ensued…a bunch of name-calling about who falls where on some imaginary political spectrum. Is there not something more interesting to the conservatives at USC than this crappy website and the shoddy poll it ran? 
By the way, I took IR 323, and yes, it has a bias towards internationalism and ecological conservation. I also took US Foreign Economic Policy and Intro to Political Economy, and these classes had a serious bias towards promoting US interests above all others, and a deep underlying assumption that modern capitalism universally improves quality of life. Sounds reasonably conservative to me. The Economics department at SC is also quite conservative, as my friends from that department tell me.
Lets not forget about the Board of Trustees? Who do THEY give money to? Why does the definition of the University as an Institution stop and start with students and faculty? 
A little critical analysis would benefit this piece tremendously.
“Trojanelli” there are plenty of answers to your three questions (and by the way, the answer to #2 is #3, which you have mischaracterized as adding to the deficit. Of course when business is booming there is more revenue for government. This is basic, but it is not usually taught here, now is it, which is the whole point of this article.)
Anyway. Good job Joe in calling out Crigler’s stream of utter nonsense. Let’s see, if liberals are critical thinkers and developers of new ideas, that makes conservatives… hmmm… surely she didn’t mean that!
The irony, as Joe pointed out, is that liberals are developers of old and flawed ideas. Trojanelli, have you walked through South Central? This is a region that has been completely shaped by Leftist ideology. Most inner cities have been across the country. They are beautiful laboratories illustrating the failure of Left-leaning policy. 
Again, these are legit questions that ARE NOT BEING ASKED HERE (or at many universities). Again, that is the point. 
BTW the graphic on faculty political donations is very misleading. Clearly, GOP donations are less than 10 percent of the Democratic, but the graphic shows roughly half.
Sigh. More of the same.
The whole premise is failed the minute it reduced an entire campus into a discrete set of binary criteria.  People who are socialist are not the same as people who are communist, etc.  Saying that the campus leans “liberal” does not really mean much because it is not painting the complete picture.  
Furthermore, this fails to break down by schools.  The majority of the University falls under arts and letters, which historically (and I’m taking centuries-worth) lean left, so it might be normal for there to be a cluster of people with left-leaning beliefs.  On the other hand, Marshall leans heavily right, with the exception of the social entrepreneurs there (also a reflection of changing attitudes).  If they want to be more accurate, they need to track down concentrations and commitment to ideologies. There may be 11 out of 17 groups that “are liberal,” but perhaps the remaining 6 are more fundamentalist or more active, which should factor back into overall campus attitudes.
dP, what you fail to understand is, outside of the alternate universe where left-wing ideologues live, nobody much CARES whether you’re a socialist, a communist, a fascist, a Marxist, a Maoist, or some other flavor of leftist. They all share the same fundamentally wrong premises, and we reject all of them.
Joe,  please be specific about your charges.   Are you saying medicare, welfare, unemployment benefits, are not worthwhile in a civil society.   Are you saying the Civil Rights Act was not the right thing to do.  Are you saying other liberal causes like…… the end of slavery [remember the conservatives were not marching with the Abolitionists], and women’s right to vote [remember the conservatives were not marching with the Suffragettes] …were the wrong way to go in this fine country???
Just tell us,  exactly what liberal, or other causes you disagree with…please.
 You have every right to promote Conservative Values and agenda……but if you dare disagree with Liberal causes….then please have the courtesy to explain your anger.   Just throwing mud and making hallow charges does NOT  help the political debate…..
For example, I am proud of the TEA Party for raising the political consciousness and getting people excited about the political process…..I believe they had some good candidates……[however, in two cases..they did NOT have candidates ready to serve as intelligent & qualified senators:   in Nevada [Angle] or in Delaware [C. O’Donnell].
 also…..they are right to be concerned about TAXES, Deficit Spending, Jobs……HOWEVER, they and the Republicans have NOT articulated
1.  Where they would make significant Cuts in Spending.
2.  How they are going to stimulate Job Growth in the Private Sector,
or 3.  How they are going to PAY FOR TAX CUTS [which ADD to the Deficit!!!!
Joe, Maybe you can give me these answers…..
Trojanelli, you may need a refresher on history. The abolition of slavery was brought about by Christian, conservative, Republicans under the leadership of radical right-wing third-party candidate Abraham Lincoln.  The fight for Civil Rights was waged by conservative Christians like Martin Luther King, Jr., and it was liberal Democrats turning the fire hoses on them.  The Republican Party won the battle in Congress for the 1964 Civil Rights act, while liberal Democrats like Robert Byrd filibustered and fought it.  Women’s suffrage was supported by both parties, and the first women in Congress and the Senate were Republicans. (First female President coming soon… you betcha!)
So that leaves you with what accomplishments to point at?
One big, unconstitutional, bankrupt entitlement program?
Two big, unconstitutional, bankrupt entitlement programs?
Three big, unconstitutional, bankrupt entitlement programs?
“According to Crigler, such institutes as the Unruh Institute demonstrate USC’s active stance to create bipartisan discourse on campus.”
Crigler’s idea of bipartisan discourse: “…define liberals and conservatives as ends of the spectrum and liberals as critical thinkers and developers of new ideas…”
New ideas like the ones you’ve been pounding on since the 1930s? Critical thinking about, like, a century’s worth of history of failure and death stemming from your sick ideology?
When you have a campus institute for politics set up intentionally to spread left-wing lies about political facts and ideas, THAT ITSELF is evidence of the problem Crigler claims doesn’t exist.

Although many students said they voted in the 2010 California General Election, only 20.4 percent of youth aged 18 to 29 cast their vote on Tuesday, according to final exit poll results.
The youth voter turnout in Tuesday’s election was about one million votes fewer than the previous midterm elections in 2006, when 23.5 percent of youth voted, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
Tuesday’s ballot in California included a senatorial race, a gubernatorial race and several propositions, as well as local elections. Of youth who voted, the majority — 56 percent — voted Democratic, whereas 40 percent of youth voted Republican.

Students said that going to the “Moving America Forward” rally at USC on Oct. 22 affected their enthusiasm.
“The president came to make sure that we know how much of a value it is and how we should do it and make a difference because we can. It definitely got me more riled up — definitely more excited to vote,” said Roy Parker, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television.
Stephanie Tong, a senior majoring in business administration, agreed.
“The rally on campus really did encourage a lot of college students to come to vote because it became a lot more personal to them,” Tong said. “Having the president come and visit on campus made us feel that much more important, like your one vote really could make a difference.”
“In the future, if we have more rallies like this, with a lot of big-name politicians, it would really encourage another generation of college voters,” Tong said.
In recent months, students from USC’s chapter of the California Public Interest Research Group collected signatures of students pledging to vote no on Proposition 23. There have also been students campaigning their fellow Trojans to vote yes on Proposition 19.
But Sandra Espinoza, a senior majoring in English and American Studies, said that seeing political activism on campus didn’t really change her opinion.
“It’s nice to see that everyone else is getting involved and really cares about their issue, although it doesn’t really affect how I vote,” she said.
Yes on Proposition 19 campaigners were more visible on campus Tuesday than they had been over the past weeks. Amanda Charney, a freshman majoring in theatre, said their manner of promoting Proposition 19 might have made it seem less dignified.
“They were being obnoxious and getting in people’s faces. It was good that they were trying to get the vote out, but tattooing pot leaves on their bodies didn’t exactly give people a good impression of the proposition overall,” Charney said. “There’s other stuff to it besides the fact that it’s legalizing pot — there’s reasons behind it.”
However, Michelle Soroudi, a junior majoring in business administration, said political activity on campus in any form is good for the student body.
“Students on campus that don’t know what’s happening need to get involved and make their voice heard and make a change,” Soroudi said. “We’re the future so we need to be heard.”
[…]  I did find that Prop 19 came in third in reasons why voters under 40 turned out to vote and that youth turnout decreased by a million voters compared to the last midterm election in 2006.  Only one in five voters aged 18-29 voted in […]

The Lyon Center recently revamped its website, and the results are receiving mixed responses from its visitors.
The old website appeared more cluttered and wasn’t in line with the rest of the university’s websites, said Jennifer Siu, associate director of Recreational Sports.
The new website — sait.usc.edu/recsports — was designed by the Student Affairs Information Technologies department and features a “quick and sleek” look drawn from many other websites, she said.
“The new one basically gives you all the information Rec Sports has to offer: intramural schedules, special hours and different events we hold,” said Kevin Chang, a freshman majoring in business administration who works in Rec Sports.
Long-time site users such as Dan Hilderman, a senior majoring in economics, said  the new changes can make it more difficult to find information quickly.
“Before there was a lot of stuff on the front page. Now you have to go through so many links to get to the links. I think they should just put that stuff on the front page,” said Hilderman. “It’s not too bad — it’s just in a different format.”
The new site can be a little difficult to master, Siu said, but that is common when a new website layout is introduced.
For others, the experience will be much improved, she added.
“What’s interesting is you can bookmark pages, which you couldn’t do before,” Siu said. “The old one didn’t have a search engine and on this one we do.”
The website is just one of the ways Rec Sports officials say the department is working to better communicate with students.
“This is one of many electronic ways that we promote our programs to our students,” Siu said.

At USC, a school known for big-name Division I varsity sports, club sports generally get lost under a deluge of Rose Bowls, national championships and highly touted recruits. However, the USC boxing team, which started not so long ago as a couple of guys working out in the basement of a local gym, is exploding onto the regional boxing scene and is poised to make an impact on a national level.
Twenty-five members attend the team’s two-hour Tuesday/Thursday practices on campus, and anywhere between five and 10 Trojans make the half-hour drive to Gio’s Brooklyn Boxing Club in Burbank, Calif., for a more intensive workout on Monday and Wednesday nights.

Four practices a week, runs to stay in shape and actual fights represent a high level of dedication for a club sport. The dedication makes sense — the boxing club is home to USC’s best boxers because the Trojans have no varsity boxing team.
In fact, no school in the United States has one, since the NCAA outright banned collegiate boxing in the 1960s after a University of Wisconsin fighter collapsed during the NCAA championships and eventually died. The National Collegiate Boxing Association, which USC boxing belongs to, is the ruling organization for collegiate boxing — putting USC on a level playing field with any school in the United States.
Led by coach Ramon Espada and current president Evan Aguilar, a junior majoring in business administration, the team is preparing for its showcase on Friday, the L.A. Collegiate Boxing Invitational at the Los Angeles Athletic club. This event will be the first annual tournament for collegiate boxers in California, comparable to similar established tournaments in New York, Detroit and Seattle.
The USC boxing club has been the driving force behind the invitational, and to say it’s a big deal would be an understatement. The members will face off against fighters from crosstown rival UCLA and national champion West Point in a 10-bout event, headlined by the match between USC graduate student Jeff Sacha, who is studying sociology, and UCLA’s fighter Ian Cruz. Also fighting are USC students Garrick Lee, a senior majoring in fine arts and Elijah Oseguera, a senior majoring in international relations.
The team has come a long way since its inauspicious beginnings in 2006. Current assistant coach Mike Evanisko met Espada upon moving to Southern California after college. The two became good friends as Evanisko started to box as an amateur. After working as a real estate agent, Evanisko decided to enter graduate school at USC. According to Evanisko, “Ramon lit up” and proposed starting a team, and the USC boxing club was born.
To get recognized as a club sport, the duo needed more members to petition the idea to the university. Evanisko rounded up a few friends from the Marshall School of Business and submitted the application.
“At first, there was really only one member,” Evanisko said. “The rest of the guys showed up a couple of times.”
But the club grew and eventually had a group of 10 or so dedicated boxers training in the basement of a community center in South Central Los Angeles.
At first, just Evanisko fought, winning bouts at San Jose State, Santa Clara and Reno.
“At that point, it was just me and Ramon,” Evanisko said. “We’d leave L.A. as late as 10 or 12  most nights ­— I had school, and he had work. We’d drive through the night, find something to eat and somewhere to stay, and get ready for the fight.”
Evanisko qualified for regionals in Las Vegas in 2007 but was paired up against one of the top fighters at the tournament and lost.
NCBA rules state that graduate students only have one year of eligibility, so the next year USC lost its only competitive fighter. Despite the setback, which could have potentially dissolved the team, USC boxing continued to grow thanks to a dedicated core group of members. Every boxer who has served as president of the club is still involved with the team, and has been since the beginning.
Then in 2008, Lee took over as president, and Espada remained as the coach. The club continued to grow, and jumped between gyms to accommodate its growing membership, moving from the L.A. Boxing Club, to the Sands Gym Downtown, to Wild Card, where Manny Pacquiao — one of the best boxers in the world — trains.
Even with all the changes, the fighters have grown better and more consistent; two years ago, Sacha qualified for collegiate nationals in Maryland but couldn’t attend because of budget restrictions.
USC boxing has taken off in the past few years, yet members still have lofty goals.
“I’m hoping to send Jeff, Garrick, Elijah and Chris to the Western Collegiate Championships, and then maybe nationals,” Espada said.
Espada believes at least one of the fighters has a shot at grabbing a national title this year. Now that they’ve starting hosting shows, Espada hopes to eventually host a regional or national championship here in Los Angeles.
One of the problems USC boxing has faced is the lack of a consistent practice facility that is properly outfitted. Sacha solved that problem. USC boxing is working to build a gym at the Graf Pit at Pico Union, in exchange for teaching boxing classes to local kids. This would allow the team to not only have a steady, close practice facility but also to give back to the community and gain recognition.
Espada has loftier goals for the future.
“UNLV and UNR have big boxing gyms on campus, with all the gear they need, and around 100 fighters on the team,” he said. “We can do something like that.”
One thing is for sure — the club is going nowhere but up.
“This whole thing has been driven by Ramon,” Evanisko said. “As long as he’s here, the club will be around. He won’t let it die.”
How about an MMA club, or Muay Thai team? Boxing is a start though.

Summer 2005 should have been a triumphant time in the life of then-23-year-old Andrew McMahon. Taking a break from the mounting success of his high school band Something Corporate, he had just wrapped up the finishing touches of Everything In Transit, the debut album from his side project, Jack’s Mannequin.
But instead of celebrating, he spent the next few months in a New York hospital facing the harsh reality that he might not even live to see the record be released.
McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a form of cancer of the white blood cells. Despite the unfortunate news, he made it a top priority to remain positive.

“In a strange twist of fate, I actually started playing music after watching a family member lose his struggle with melanoma,” McMahon said. “His lesson to all of us as he was fading was that even in light of tragedies that happen to everyone at some point, the only way to get through it is to be calm.”
After radiation treatment, two rounds of chemotherapy and a successful stem cell transplant, McMahon was able to overcome the disease. In an effort to provide a voice for others facing a similar struggle, he released video footage of his treatment and recovery in the form of a documentary film, Dear Jack.
Even for McMahon, who is known for his boldly personal lyrics, sharing such a raw narrative with the public was nerve-wracking.
“With a song, you can veil yourself a little bit and you can find a way to say something very honest but not necessarily give your whole life away with it,” McMahon said. “In the context of the film, that was the first time that people really ever saw who I am in a private space. It was the most I’ve ever felt exposed.”
In July 2006 McMahon created the Dear Jack Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to raising funds for young adult cancer patients. McMahon explained that a big part of his recovery process was realizing he could take control of the disease by helping others fight it.
“If you talk to anybody who has seen the disease, whether it be having it or seeing someone who has it, something just clicks in you immediately that you need to do something to make it better for the next in line,” McMahon said.
The Dear Jack Foundation partnered with groups such as the UCLA stem cell transplant program, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation to research treatment and improve the quality of life for patients. Sponsoring events such as an annual “Light the Night” walk and setting up booths at concerts, the foundation has consistently raised upwards of $50,000 per year since its creation.
The next big event for the Dear Jack Foundation is its first benefit concert on Nov. 1, in which McMahon will perform with both Something Corporate and Jack’s Mannequin.
“I look at this as a great environment to put both bands onstage,” McMahon said. “In a lot of ways, these guys saw me through my experience with cancer and now that I’m celebrating five years in remission and feeling great, having everybody play together makes sense.”
Delighted fans and supporters of the cause jumped at the chance to attend this one-night-only show in the intimate setting of Los Angeles’ El Rey Theatre, as tickets sold out within hours of the announcement of the concert. Because there is so much interest in it, McMahon has high hopes for making the concert an annual function.
The concert will feature many ways for attendees to donate to the cause, including merchandise tables and a raffle. Even those who will not be at the show can get involved by participating in the Dear Jack Foundation online auction, held at eBay.com.
Items up for bid include one-of-a-kind Something Corporate and Jack’s Mannequin merchandise, autographed vinyl records, Nike shoes exclusively designed by McMahon and VIP passes to the sold out Dear Jack Foundation benefit concert.
“Our goal is to make this a night where we can raise a lot of money for the foundation and do a lot of good with it,” McMahon said. “I hope people go out and spend more money on these things than they’re worth.”
Following the benefit concert, McMahon will focus on making new music with Jack’s Mannequin. He said that after the emotionally jarring content of the band’s second album, The Glass Passenger, he is looking forward to being able to make a record without the lingering effects of his illness appearing in his writing.
McMahon will also remain passionate as ever about the Dear Jack Foundation.
“People lose to this disease every day, which is why we continue to fight,” McMahon said. “It’s not something you want to see anybody go through once you’ve been there. That’s a huge motivator for me on a daily basis.”

Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, hosts of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, respectively, held a rally last weekend in the heart of Washington, D.C.
The “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear” drew an estimated 200,000 people from various demographics and featured a multitude of musical guests (including The Roots and Sheryl Crow) and celebrities (including, interestingly enough, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Stewart represented the ideology of sanity and moderation, whereas Colbert represented fear, leading to moments of clever, campy and eventually absurd humor. The finale of the rally involved a giant papier-mâché Colbert being melted by the chants of the audience, led by Peter Pan (Daily Show contributor John Oliver).
Throughout the rally, Stewart and Colbert’s satirical criticism was a double-edged sword, cutting at both the political left and right and hitting mainstream media. And at the end of it all, the rally was perceived to be a success and a sign that, yes, much of the United States is searching for solutions and composed thinking, not babble-headed, vitriol-laced, aggressive rhetoric.
It seemed the right kind of rally at the right time for this nation — a time when pseudo-revolutionary language and pointed fingers have fueled the public politically.
And yet, for all its good intentions, the rally was a lightning rod for criticism. Even before the rally began, both Stewart and Colbert took hits for going outside of their realm and being “too political,” which is where we return to that oh-so-familiar literary tradition: satire.
What Stewart, Colbert and other comedians like them have done recently is nothing short of a miracle, and it speaks to the fact that humor can be more than just, well, humor. Who could have imagined that someone such as Colbert would go on C-SPAN and, in-character, speak critically and informatively about the immigrant farm workers?
Yet some critics still seem to believe that culturally aware comedians must be treated like 1950s housewives: put in their place and kept in a role in which they belong, which is simply to make people laugh.
It didn’t end there, of course. After the rally, the duo was criticized of perpetuating liberal groupthink, of being condescending with the concept of sanity, of elitism. This got me thinking: Did any of these critics actually watch the rally?
“Jon Stewart: Is there method in his ‘sanity?’ His world comprises the sane ‘Us’ vs. the insane ‘Them,’” wrote The Daily Beast’s Tunku Varadarajan. “I look forward to Stewart saying, on his show, that the Democrats lost in large numbers because ‘America is insane.’ And then he, and others like him, can take elegant consolation in their sanity.”
Peter Beinart, a senior political writer at the same publication, also chimed in on the topic.
“When historians look back at what the American left did wrong in the early Obama years, they’ll have an entire event, preserved on CSPAN, which captures it perfectly,” Beinart said. “Maybe it’s not fair to blame Jon Stewart for all this. He’s a comedian, after all. But he’s the left’s closest equivalent to Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck.”
Excuse me?
It’s words like these that get me buying more and more into a substantial point of the rally itself: that today’s media is too busy following sensationalist logic, stretching news over assumptions and raising blood pressures nationwide without elevating any brain activity with it.
After all, it’s the only way to explain such statements as Jon Stewart being “the left’s closest equivalent to Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck.” So is it a surprise that a very valuable concern — that mainstream media, or as Stewart called it, the “24-hour political pundit perpetual panic conflictinator” is fueling greater unrest and division in The United States — went directly over critics’ heads?
Maybe not.
The mainstream media is at a crossroads today. Is the nation made better by the focus on conflict, or is there something of substance to experiencing life through a calmer lens?
Writers such as Beinart seem to believe that “the right has found a way of acknowledging Americans’ terror,” which is a curious way to explain what many times looks and sounds like fearmongering.
And Keith Olbermann still seems to think that his exuberant aggression on MSNBC’s Countdown is “sticking up for the powerless” instead of what usually resembles slightly off-base ranting.
The world we see shapes the world we live. Laughs aside, Stewart and Colbert have a point: The world we’ve been seeing as of late is not exactly a bastion of positivity.
I know that most of the people I know, regardless of ideological differences, aren’t the ones throwing words like “socialism” and “racist” around at every opportunity. But I also can’t help but think that the portrayal of the nation in media today makes us all believe, at least subconsciously, that we are under attack; and as we all know, people under attack don’t respond in the most rational ways.
Maybe that’s why some are so intent on pretending that it’s 1776 all over again.
It took two comedians and a lot of satirical humor, but the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear did what mainstream media couldn’t: provide a viewpoint that helped us catch a breath and think about what a little moderation can do for us.
“This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith, or people of activism, or look down our noses at the heartland, or passionate argument, or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear,” Stewart said at the rally. “They are, and we do. But we live now in hard times, not end times. And we can have animus, and not be enemies. … If we amplify everything, we hear nothing.”
I hope the media caught that last part, but it’s probably unlikely. Until the media calms down, it might just be wise to take our daily dose of news with a slight grain of salt, along with a little dash of humor.
Eddie Kim is a sophomore majoring in print journalism. His column, “Culture Clash,” runs Thursdays.
Interesting piece, but I’m not sure that characterizing Stewart and Colbert as the leftist equivalent of Beck & co is altogether wrong.
I’m also not sure that their appeal to sanity is not just another way of demanding people shutup and pretend the ‘hope’ is still alive. They’re behaving as reactionary tabloid satirists defending the status quo.
Altough I’m not an American, I recall quite clearly the hyperbole and rabidity that Bush was attacked with. The behaviour was certainly more over the top than those who are attacking the current government.
I believe those who attacked Bush were right, just as I believe most of those attacking Obama are right.
Claiming media or public insanity is a very clear political act. It absolutely does not come from a neutral position.

Marc Horowitz walked into Vieta Coffee, a little cafe just a stone’s throw away from the Graduate Fine Arts Building on the corner of 30th and Flower streets. It’s the place where he spends most of his time these days.
Horowitz, 34, greeted the barista by name and they discussed the Back to the Future trilogy, which the first-year MFA student in the Roski School of Fine Arts had recently recommended to his coffee buddy.
But beginning this week, the roles were reversed. The shaggy-haired Horowitz is now on the receiving end of all such advice as he embarks on a month-long quest called “The Advice of Strangers.”
Photo Courtesy of Creative Time
Every day for the month of November, Horowitz will post his decisions — both meaningful and mundane — on the Internet and allow people to vote on what they’d like to see him do.
It certainly isn’t your traditional art project — there’s no paint, no sculpture and no sketchbook. Although he considers his work social practice or media art, he is hesitant to label himself an artist.
“Sometimes I say I’m an artist. Sometimes I say I’m a comedian. Sometimes I say I’m an entertainer. Sometimes I say I’m a businessman or sometimes I say I’m just a dude,” Horowitz said. “I have many answers.”
A cameraman will document the winning decisions and post clips of Horowitz’s experiences at www.theadviceofstrangers.com so that voters can see the outcome of their input.
For each decision, Horowitz creates several potential multiple-choice options but also encourages users to make suggestions. He says he will ignore posts from so-called Internet “trolls” who make lewd and offensive comments on these sites to get a rise out of other users.
But that doesn’t mean he isn’t willing to venture outside of his comfort zone during this experience, which he compares to snowboarding.
“You do a jump or you might do a grab and land it and just keep going,” Horowitz said. “But if there’s a camera on you, you’re going to want to go big. You’re going to want to show everybody that you can do the best thing you can do. I have all these people potentially that are investing themselves in helping me or not helping me so I want to ask them pretty big issues that I’ve been wondering for a long time and just clear my closet — just clear everything out and be like, ‘Here’s what I want to deal with, what do you think?’”
So far, decisions he has left in the hands of his anonymous Internet followers are the possible discussion topics to address during an appointment with his shrink and what he should do with his facial hair.
He recently posted a “big question” in which he asked users if he should: a) find his best friend from grade school; b) visit his father’s grave; c) write, produce, direct and cast a play or d) meet as many of his Facebook friends as possible.
But the project is not Horowitz’s first social experiment of this kind. Many of his past efforts involved what he calls “meaningful interactions with complete strangers around an absurd principle.”
When he worked as an assistant on a Crate & Barrel catalogue photo shoot in 2005, he put his name and cell phone number on a dry erase board in one of the spreads. He received an estimated 30,000 calls in the span of a few months, less than 50 of which he said were prank calls.
He later bought an RV and drove across the country to meet with about 150 of these strangers for dinner dates.
Projects like this have led fellow first-year MFA student Chris Coy to call Horowitz “the fun uncle that you want to hang out with.”
“I get enjoyment out of Marc’s putting himself out there, which is why I think his projects tend to be more popular — because people are wanting to have some kind of experience but are too trepidacious themselves to go out and do it fully,” Coy said. “They need somebody to model that behavior. Here’s a guy who’s willing to go out and do that.”
In 2008, Horowitz traced his signature on a map of the United States and made stops in various towns to make “improvements.” In Nampa, Idaho he established an anonymous semi-nudist colony. In Craig, Colo. he helped residents literally bury their problems by digging a hole in the ground and filling it with all of their baggage.
Unlike some of his family members, Horowitz’s mother, Karen Meyer, has always supported the less-than-traditional life path her son has decided to take. He graduated with a degree in business, marketing and microeconomics from Indiana University but quickly abandoned that to pursue his desires to interact with the community, engage in a variety of social situations and explore less passive modes of social networking.
“Growing up, he always wanted to have friends over,” Meyer said. “He was very loquacious and would get into trouble at school for talking too much in the classroom. He was very outgoing. I think he put himself out there and made friends and all these other things, so I can see why he’s doing this now.”
As Horowitz sipped his iced coffee and smoked an American Spirit cigarette, he discussed plans for someday launching a new social networking site based at least partly on his experiment.
“[Facebook and Twitter] have made it easier to connect with people at great distances, but it is limiting because they make us less capable of connecting with people that are close by,” he said. “That to me is the No. 1 thing of the project. No one’s really present anymore, I want to change the rules of engagement.”
Marc, i cannot wait to meet you. I’m on a similar path. When I’m back in LA we’ll get that beer sometime but I’m going to interview you for the fishbowl and you can take pictures of me and draw all over them. it’ll be fun.

Actor and comedian Nick Cannon came to USC on Tuesday night to perform a comedy show for a packed crowd in Bovard Auditorium.
Cannon, who now hosts NBC’s hit show America’s Got Talent, pleased the crowd with an hour of solid material focusing on topics including college life, growing up poor and being married to pop sensation Mariah Carey. Cannon had students holding their sides in laughter as he poked fun at himself and his career during the set.
All that · Despite a disappointing opening act, comedian Nick Cannon’s main event grabbed the audience’s attention throughout the entire set. - Daniel Wang | Daily Trojan 
Before Cannon went on stage, a pastor came on as the opening act — no man of the cloth, but Pastor Case, a comedian decked out in a full pastor’s robes.
Case did well as an opening act and hype man, but his material itself was hit or miss. He had control of the crowd for a second with a bit about his ex-girlfriend from hell but lost it the next by continuously trying to get the audience to chant and repeat things he said.
At the end of Case’s short set, he purposefully dropped the mic to the floor, an act reserved for top comedians after killing a huge crowd, certainly not for a 10-minute opening act. However, the comedian did his job and warmed up the crowd for the man they all came to see.
“I always wanted to go to USC,” Cannon said. “I just had one problem: learning.”
After greeting the students of the “University of South Central,” as the comedian put it, Cannon explained that he wanted to go backstage and come out with a different introduction.
After walking offstage, he came back on to an introduction that poked fun of his lackluster rap albums and subpar acting career. As the crowd roared with laughter, the theme was set for the performance and the show began to roll.
One of Cannon’s best parts of his comedic arsenal is that he knows how to please the crowd. Right off the bat he knew how to get the crowd excited and incorporated different audience members in his act, poking fun at each one.
The impromptu assistants were all good sports, however and it made for a great show atmosphere.
Though Cannon opened up with some sophomoric material on college sex life, his act quickly picked up and it was clear that he was much more than just a television host — he was a full-fledged comic.
Later in the set, Cannon turned his focus to his relationship with Carey. He joked that when people ask him how he managed to marry Carey, all he says is “I don’t know.”
He continued to say how his life is really just a successful game of Mash, a childhood game where people fantasize about their dream spouses and dream careers. Cannon of course said Carey was always No. 1 on his Mash list, a joke the crowd gladly ate up.
“I love being married, but let me tell you, the one bad thing about being married to Mariah Carey is that now people think they can come up to me and say anything they want about my wife,” Cannon said. “They’re like, ‘You don’t know what to do with all that woman.  If that were me, I’d have her hitting all the high notes.’ And I’m like, ‘Dad come on.”
Cannon did not shy away from the subject of being Carey’s “made man,” but rather openly joked about it, telling the crowd the couple is so wealthy they are “recession-free.”
Cannon continued to say that people still do not believe he is married to Carey, comparing the news to someone trying to tell him Halle Berry just married Soulja Boy.
“I wouldn’t believe me either,” he said.
Since arriving on scene at Nickelodeon’s teen sketch comedy show All That, Cannon’s strong point has always been impressions, and he presented an array of them to a very accepting crowd.
He did a quick Dave Chappelle and a classic Adam Sandler, but what had the audience in stitches was his impression of Denzel Washington, telling a story of meeting Washington at a nightclub where the legendary actor gave unusual marriage advice: hit on other women.
The comedian finished strong by talking about his upbringings and dysfunctional family — a cornerstone of almost any famous comedian’s act — explaining that despite all of his wealth he tries to stay “poor at heart.”
Cannon praised his mother, who raised him by herself, but still managed to find humor in the fact they could not afford a lot growing up, such as name brand cereals. Canon joked that instead of Tony the Tiger and Snap, Crackle, and Pop, he grew up with “Tyrone the Tiger” and “Smack, Crackhead and Pot.”
Cannon reminded the audience Tuesday night at Bovard why he became famous in the first place: He is funny. Cannon got a hold of the crowd and never let go during the set, and the result was hundreds of satisfied students. Though Cannon might be content with hosting a show and living the dream with his pop bride, it must be good to know he has a fallback career in comedy.

There is nothing more exciting to a college student than free swag, and on November 13, LAfreestore will offer a variety of free goods and services with everything from clothes and DVDs to tutoring and hugs. But there is a catch—shoppers are encouraged to donate their own goods from their closets, shelves and pantries.
Located at the Casa Princesa Café in North East LA, the one day event will consist of a plethora of activities besides the trading of goods; also scheduled are workshops involving gardening advice, yoga activities, knitting instruction and guitar lessons.
The event’s website cites its mission as “[building] community and [providing] an alternative to mainstream capitalism,” which would require “volunteerism, friendships, swapping, donations, giving, sharing and lots of smiles.”
Creator of LAfreestore and Cal Poly Pomona student Krisha Hernandez Pruhs told the Los Angeles Times that she “considers the project a way to evoke social sustainability and promote environmental ideas.”

On Oct. 30, when USC took on the Oregon Ducks, DeAnthony Arnett was there watching in the crowd. He came away impressed by the Trojans and Los Angeles in general. While he did not commit to USC, the football recruit has put the Trojans on a list of 3 schools he is strongly considering attending next year.
At 6’0” and 167 pounds, the talented wide receiver finished his junior season with 41 receptions for 876 yards and 10 touchdowns. While Michigan State was long considered Arnett’s most likely college choice, he is strongly considering the Trojans and the Tennessee Volunteers as well.
The high school senior from Saginaw High School, who is the No. 1 recruit from Michigan according to the ESPNU150 rankings, will announce his decision on Nov 11. He has already removed one school from his list of prospective schools, and will now decide amongst 3 others.
“He has eliminated Cal and is down to USC, Tennessee and Michigan State,” DeAnthony’s brother Ralph Arnett said. “Right now, DeAnthony is pretty confident in his decision but hasn’t told any of us yet and I don’t even know what he’s going to do.”
USC must now wait until Arnett’s decision to see if it is destined to receive one of the nation’s most impressive wide receiver recruits.

In defiance of the federal government’s faltering and hesitant stance on stem cell research, USC is paving the way for life-saving techniques and revolutionary research with the opening of a new stem cell research center on the Health Sciences Campus.
An 87,500-square-foot, five-story architectural marvel, the Eli and Edythe Broad California Institute for Regenerative Medicine Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research joins the ranks of other CIRM-funded facilities across California.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
The center received a $27-million grant from CIRM, bringing the total amount of grant funding to $60 million, and lifting USC into third place in the state for the most stem cell research funding, behind Stanford University and UC San Francisco.
Scientists with the center focus on cardiology, ophthalmology, neurology, cancer, liver disease and diabetes within the three primary areas of inquiry of discovery stem cell research: preclinical research, preclinical development and clinical research.
The center conjoins USC’s Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute and the Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower into a “research triangle” in a transdiscliplinary, collaborative effort in solving pressing medical issues. It also partners with the City of Hope Medical Center and Research Center and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.
But the opening of the new facility is not without its controversies.
Stem cell research has been a hot-button issue for many years, and this center does use embryonic stem cells.
To complicate the debate, on Aug. 23, federal district judge Royce Lamberth issued an injunction halting federal funding of embryonic stem cell research — including millions from the National Institute of Health, one of the largest financial supporters for research. Hundreds of projects were placed in indeterminate hiatus.
The new USC center, however, sidesteps the injunction by receiving funds only from state grants and private donors, eliminating the concern for federally imposed restrictions on embryonic stem cell research.
And what better place for independence and innovation in stem cell research than California?
At the groundbreaking ceremony for the center, Eli Broad, who donated $30 million toward the project, said “We have the best scientists and researchers right here at USC. And with California leading the way in stem cell advances, it’s only logical that we create the institutions and facilities around the campus that are going to continue to accelerate stem cell research here in our backyard.”
California proves an ideal state for stem cell funding because of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, which passed with an overwhelming majority in 2004. Proposition 71 created CIRM and allocated $3 billion for stem cell research in California universities and other institutes.
CIRM funding, along with private philanthropies, support crucial research in stem cells, allowing California — and now USC — to spearhead the movement, even if Washington, D.C. is not ready for the future of health research.
The new center proves USC’s willingness and eagerness to embrace innovative technologies and cutting-edge research without catering to the vagaries of national politics.
But USC has steadily been expanding and developing into a research-intensive powerhouse among universities and institutions. The Keck School of Medicine’s epidemiological cancer surveillance research program received $23.5 million in federal grants in August. Further, USC Trustee Ming Hsieh’s  recently announced a gift of $50 million to create the USC Ming Hsieh Institute for Research on Engineering-Medicine for Cancer in exploring nanomedicine for cancer.
The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research is but the latest advancement in USC’s continual transformation as a vanguard of health science innovation, proving that the university is willing to take bold steps forward to benefit science.

Elizabeth Garrett is like any good lawyer.
She gathers the facts that advance her client’s case, she uses that information to articulate a clear vision for the trial ahead and she will fight for her client to no end.
Now, Garrett will utilize those same skills with her new client: the University of Southern California.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Garrett — a legal scholar, former legislative director and professor, and interim provost since President C.L. Max Nikias was announced USC’s 11th president — was appointed to provost and senior vice president for academic affairs just last week.
Trojan students, staff, faculty and alumni have every reason to be cheerful about Garrett’s appointment to the second-ranking position within the university.
Garrett’s visionary thinking and rooted knowledge of the university’s success will prove instrumental in getting USC on the move to greater heights.
Since joining the USC faculty in 2003, Garrett has advanced her credentials here on campus, which is crucial for a position that demands innovation in all arenas.
As vice provost for academic affairs, vice president for academic planning and budget and eventually as interim provost, she has the well-rounded knowledge and necessary firepower to assist Nikias in advancing USC’s mission.
After her appointment, Nikias told USC News that Garrett “proved to be an exceptional leader, showing boundless energy in advancing the university’s initiatives and a remarkable gift for innovative thinking and charismatic leadership.”
With her experience, Garrett knows what already makes this university an elite institution.
“USC is a vibrant research university,” Garrett told USC News, later adding, “The faculty of USC are productive and engaged with their students and with society at large with respect to their teaching, research, learning and creative activities … We have excellent students — both graduate and undergraduate, engaged and productive scholars.”
Though Garrett knows the ins and outs of USC, she knows that she wasn’t appointed to keep the university static in its place, complacent in its recent accolades.
Instead, she must hone her passion and creativity to articulate a clear vision for the university moving forward.
“We are very proud of our academic accomplishments of the past two decades, and rightfully so,” Garrett said. “But there is no sense that we’re going to stop.”
These goals won’t just sit on a pedestal, waiting for someone higher up to address them. Behind the charisma and eloquent arguments that advance USC’s case, Garrett will be doing a lot of the hard work necessary to fuel an intellectually driven environment that matches the drive of today’s students and faculty.
This is not an environment the president can create by himself. This is why it is crucial that he must trust his counsel, a copilot who will never cease to fight for the university.
As the caliber of USC’s students continues to rise, this rise must be met with the same creativity, boldness and courage in a competent provost that puts the university’s interests ahead of her own.
“We have to retain the distinctiveness and excellence that characterizes our undergraduate experience, while also increasing the residential nature of the campus, ensuring that students have opportunities for hands-on research and other opportunities with our best faculty, and providing even more academically focused extracurricular activities that enhance our classroom experiences,” Garrett said.
It is only fitting that these goals come from a leader in her own profession.
Garrett is persistent in her adherence to the USC mission — of making a global impact in the world. But she will also prove audacious in advancing the mission according to an increasingly talented student body, dedicated faculty, and supportive alumni throughout the world.
This is a client that Garrett couldn’t turn away. And this is an attorney that we couldn’t be without.
I rest my case.

Propositions 20, 22, 25 and 26 passed and propositions 19, 21, 23, 24 and 27 failed in the California General Election Tuesday.
Prop 19, which would have legalized the use of marijuana for those over age 21, was one of the most closely-followed propositions. It was defeated by 7.8 percent margin, with 46.1 percent of voters supporting and 53.9 percent opposing.
Many students with the California Public Interest Research Group campaigned against Prop 23, which was defeated by a large margin — 61.2 percent of voters opposed and 38.8 percent supported it.
CalPIRG collected 100,000 pledges on college campuses for people to vote no on the proposition that would have repealed A.B. 32, which has measures to protect the environment.
CalPIRG also publicly opposed Prop 26, which did pass, and will require a 2/3 legislative vote to raise fees. This could empower the Republican minority to prevent fees, which are taxes levied for a specific purpose, from being imposed on the commodities that typically encounter them, usually alcohol, tobacco and gas.
Proposition 22’s passage will also make balancing a budget more difficult, as it prohibits the state from taking local funds.
This will have an effect of privileging regions whose residents have higher incomes. It was passed by a 22 percent margin, with 61 percent voting yes and 39 percent voting no.
However, Prop 25 passed, so the legislature needs a simple majority, rather than a 2/3 majority, to pass a budget. The Democratic majority in the legislature will be able to enact its policies without reliance on compromise with the Republican minority.
Many hope this will also shorten the long period that it takes for Sacramento to pass the budget, which was 100 days overdue this year.
Propositions 20 and 27, which both dealt with the way redistricting occurs, resulted in a committee being formed to redistrict.
Proposition 20 passed by a 22.4 percent margin and Proposition 27 failing by an 18.8 percent margin. This is will prevent elected state officials from gerrymandering, redistricting to ensure reelection for themselves or their party.
Lastly, Proposition 21 failed by a 16.2 percent margin, which will mean difficulties for state park funding in the future. The proposition’s passage would have added a $18 vehicle license surcharge to fund state parks, which have had severe funding problems since the recession began.

You came. You voted.  The Democrats conquered.
And then just like that, the California statewide elections were over.
The next couple of weeks will likely be spent analyzing the ripple effect of the results of the midterm elections across the country, with particular focus on the shift of power in the House of Representatives, the Democrats’ retention of the majority in the Senate and how all of this serves to hinder or support President Barack Obama’s agenda.
Similar conversations will undoubtedly take place on campus, but there’s another issue that will likely trump any issues regarding political ideology.
On Tuesday, many students who had registered to vote in the election, were not on the lists of registered voters at on-campus polling locations.  Although these students were able to cast votes, they were given provisional ballots instead of traditional ones.
A similar problem occurred during the 2008 general election.
All things considered, we want to know:
What impact, if any, did the on-campus polling place issues have on your voting experience?
–
What do you think? Add your two cents to the conversation by submitting a comment in the entry form below.
It counts. I have a friend who lost a big election by three votes. He only knew for sure once they’d counted all the absentee and provisional ballots several times.
It upset me terribly. It is also pretty sad considering 80% of the people who voted in Marks Tower aren’t really going to have any effect on the election-yes, provisional ballots are counted, but not for days afterwards and the “winners” of the election are already decided. Because I participated in Southside’s “Battle of the Ballot,” I trusted those who were in charge of the competition to make sure my voter registration paper was sent in after it was counted. Unfortunately, I (along with many others who trusted the Battle of the Ballot people) was not registered to vote with this address in time to vote regularly.

President Obama took responsibility for voter frustration after Tuesday night’s midterm elections, calling the election night “humbling.”
He cited the results of the elections – which placed Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and gave them stronger control in the Senate – as being based heavily on voter frustration with the nation’s slow economic progress, according to the New York Times. 
“There is no doubt that people’s number one concern is the economy. What they were expressing great frustration about is that we haven’t made enough progress on the economy,” the president said at a news conference.
The president said he promised to work harder at building bipartisan consensus between the two parties, and that he takes “direct responsibility” for the failure of the country to make as much economic progress as was needed, according to the Times.
Obama vowed repeatedly to work closely with Republican newcomers in Washington, although he acknowledged that Republicans and Democrats would inevitably be unwilling to compromise on certain principles.
When asked about his original policy agenda, the president said that it had not been a plan to fundamentally transform government, but rather an emergency response to a time of crisis.
He said, however, that many mistook his temporary emergency approaches for a more extreme desire to change government.
Obama said the “shellacking” he received by voters on Tuesday helped him to realize the importance of stepping outside of the “bubble” of the White House.
“When you’re in this place, it is hard not to seem removed,” he said.

Lindsay Lohan has gone bonkers and Miley Cyrus seems well on her way. Britney went crazy, but she seems like she’s faring ok. And Christina? Despite the divorce, the girl has coped well.
Not all young Hollywood starlets make it out of the glitz and glamour with their sanity in tact, yet luckily, not all of them go out with a bang like Lohan either.
Demi Lovato is the most recent young celebrity that seems to be having trouble coping with the pressure of living under a microscope. Lovato, who became famous for shows on the Disney channel like Camp Rock and That’s So Sonny, has been touring with the Jonas Brothers this year.
This week, she checked herself into a rehab facility for “emotional and physical issues” according to her representatives. People Magazine reports that issues with cutting and an ongoing eating disorder, as well as a fight with someone on tour, finally forced Lovato to seek professional help. Lovato’s check-in was a surprise, however, to many of her fans and loyal followers.
Lovato, 18, is only one example of countless girls struggling with their own notions of body image and acceptance. Although she is attempting to keep her personal problems away from the spotlight, perhaps she will prove to be a positive example for young girls who need help, unlike most of the starlets before her.
I am sure that the only thing half of Lovato’s peeps are worried about is the money they are losing.
The promoters, the agents, her manager are all taking a hit with her stopping touring.
She is NOT Demi Lovato, she is a money making machine and that’s how she is looked at. This is the truth and the way the business is and has always been.
From her bookers, to her hookers, they are all out of work.

The theme of the day was “calm, cool, and confident” for USC coach Kevin O’Neill and junior forward Nikola Vucevic as the two headed to the Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live Thursday for the Pac-10 men’s basketball media day. 
​As O’Neill addressed the media’s concerns that USC is in danger of falling to the bottom of the Pac-10, he explained that the Trojans are in the rebuilding process after losing ten starters in just a year and a half.
​“We lost three guys to the pros, we lost a whole recruiting class that’s starting other places, and then we lost three starters from last year and I dismissed Leonard Washington. So we’re trying to piece this back together.”
​Coming off a rough first year plagued with controversy after losing postseason eligibility in January because of self-imposed sanctions, O’Neill knew he and his team would be on the chopping block.
​When asked about different media sources picking USC to place sixth in the Pac-10 this year, O’Neill responded sarcastically, “Well, we’re going to finish sixth then.  You guys are always right.”
​O’Neill kept his cool and stuck to the positive, explaining to the media that he is extremely impressed with his freshman players so far, including freshman forward Curtis Washington, who O’Neill said is “a way better rebounder and shot blocker than I thought he was going to be as a freshman.”
​Vucevic told the media that he has most improved his conditioning, which he worked on while playing for the Montenegro national team over the summer.
​“I got in a lot better shape,” said Vucevic, “ and with the help of the new strength coach (Shaun Brown), I’ll be able to play more minutes.”
​The Trojans know they will be playing with a monkey on their backs this season, but with the positive attitude of their coach and the leadership of their newly elected captains (Alex Stepheson, Marcus Simmons and Donte Smith), USC hopes to beat the odds and get far into the NCAA tournament.

A male student bicyclist collided with a university shuttle bus on Wednesday morning, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
The collision occurred at about 9 a.m. on the corner of Downey Way and McClintock Avenue. The bicyclist was struck by the right side of the bus as he attempted to cross Downey Way, Carlisle said.
Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics responded to the scene and treated the student, who was then transported to California Hospital. His condition is not known.
The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the collision.
I’ll bet he was going the wrong way. I see it every day.
I really hope the student is all right.
This really shows the importance of caution over speed, for both bicyclists and shuttle drivers – both of whom are often far too reckless.

The Sigma Nu fraternity held a vigil Tuesday night for student Jackson Roddy, the freshman who fell from the sixth floor of Birnkrant Residential College early Monday morning.
The vigil brought more than 100 students together in prayer to show support for Roddy, who is at California Hospital in critical condition with severe injuries.
Police are still investigating the cause of the fall, according to Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle.
Brian Huefner, president of Sigma Nu, the fraternity Roddy is pledging, said Roddy was awake for short periods of time Tuesday.
“We’re taking it one surgery at a time, one day at a time,” Huefner said. “It’s a blessing that he has everyone here for him.”
According to Huefner, it will take one to two weeks before Roddy will be fully awake and possibly accept visitors.
John Lee, a freshman majoring in biological sciences, attended the vigil on Tuesday.
“It was pretty emotional. I’ve hung out with him quite a bit. He’s a good kid,” Lee said.
Others said the vigil has a powerful message.
“I thought it was a beautiful thing where everyone on The Row could lend support and prayer, and unite as one to wish for his healing,” said Amanda Borland, a freshman majoring in business administration.
President C.L. Max Nikias visited Roddy on Tuesday and met with the family, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson.
“His family is very appreciative of all the support they are receiving from the university,” Jackson said in an e-mail.
Roddy’s pledge brothers decided to create a “24/7 prayer.” People are invited to sign up for 15-minute time slots to ensure that someone is always praying for and thinking of Roddy.
“As long as he’s doing OK, I’m doing OK,” said Colby Audette, Roddy’s pledge brother. “Constant prayer can’t hurt; it’ll only help.”
A Facebook page, “Prayers for Jackson Roddy,” was also created in support for Roddy on Tuesday.
“The fact that he survived the fall is a miracle. Adding to the miraculous is he appears to have no head trauma or neck injury,” a post on the page said. “The outpouring of support has been amazing. Don’t take our reluctance to talk as a lack of appreciation. We just have a lot to process … keep those prayers coming.”
Students seeking counseling or support can contact Student Affairs at (213) 740-2421 or the USC Student Counseling Services at (213) 740-7711.

Panelists at the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics discussed the predicted results of Tuesday’s midterm elections and urged both political parties to use the watershed change of power as an opportunity for compromise.   
Dan Schnur, the chairman of California’s Fair Political Practices Commission and the director of the Unruh Institute, led the panel discussion with Roberto Suro, faculty fellow at the USC Center on Communication Leadership & Policy.

They were joined by Hillary Levi. a senior majoring in cinema-television production, and Tessa Madden, a senior majoring in political science.
Break it down · Dan Schnur, chairman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, spoke on a panel at Annenberg on Tuesday night. - Dan Doperalski | Daily Trojan 
They deliberated on the anticipated Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, wins by the Democratic party in California and the nature of this year’s electoral turnout.   
“It appears that Republicans have regained control of the House,” Schnur said. “For those of you on the other side of the aisle, it appears Democrats will maintain control of the Senate.”  
Suro speculated as to the causes of the nation’s recent electoral volatility.
“It could also be a result of the way the media age is developing. It allows for very rapid mobilization around ideas like we’ve never seen before,” Suro said.
Utilization of social and digital media by the Obama administration was a key factor in his win, but the panelists were unsure how it factored in this election.
“Democrats spent more in this election than Republicans,” Suro said. “And if you look at the demographics of Tea Party voters, they aren’t necessarily the kind of voters you’d reach with digital media.”
Levi discussed the idea of a conflict between traditional Republicans and new members.   
“What we’re seeing is the changing face of Republican politics, where you have traditionalists who bring a moderate, solutions-oriented attitude to the Hill and those younger, more excited members, like those in the Tea Party, who are dead-set on seeing their message and idea of change come into play,” Levi said.
Zach Lindberg, a junior majoring in business administration and political science who identified as Republican, said he was happy with the results of the elections.
“I’m ecstatic,” he said. “And I think people will be surprised, because I expect the Republicans will work closely with the president on education and foreign policy issues, but I also think, in terms of the economy, they’ll hold true to their core ideals.”
Jafet Santiago, a senior majoring in political science who also identified as Republican, was disappointed with the party’s results in California.
“Yeah, I was disappointed,” he said. “I think if you followed the polling, it was always pretty clear that California was going to remain a Democratic stronghold.”
Correction: 11/7/10: A previous version of this story identified Hillary Levi as a political science major. Levi is actually a cinema-television production major. This version of the story has been corrected to reflect the change. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Third-term incumbent Barbara Boxer won the California Senate race on Tuesday, helping Democrats maintain their majority in the U.S. Senate.

“From the time I was elected to that first office from way back, I only had one reason for why I went into politics and that was to make life better for the people I represent,” Boxer said her victory speech on  Tuesday night. “That’s who I am, that’s who I’m about.”
Boxer, 69, defeated Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, a position that experts said worked against the conservative senatorial candidate.
“Boxer proved to be an effective candidate. She’s a forceful speaker and has a lot of confidence,” said Tom Hollihan, a political expert and professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
Hollihan also mentioned that there have been complaints about how Fiorina, 56, led Hewlett-Packard during the financial meltdown.
“Questions about [Fiorina’s] leadership at Hewlett-Packard were damaging to her,” Hollihan said. “Being a former corporate CEO was not the ideal position.”
After serving as a member of the House of Representatives for 10 years, Boxer joined the Senate in January 1993. California re-elected Boxer for a third term in 2004 when she won 6.9 million votes, marking a record for the most votes for a senatorial candidate in the country’s history.
“Boxer’s experience has been a big factor in this campaign,” said Ann Crigler, interim director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “That’s how Fiorina has run her campaign — running against Boxer’s career.”
A strong supporter of Boxer’s campaign proved to be President Barack Obama, who recently visited USC in late October to fundraise and rally support for her.
“Obama’s visit helped motivate people because people in California still like the president and feel more favorable toward him,” Crigler said.
At the “Moving America Forward” rally — hosted in Alumni Park and attended by 37,500 people — Obama and Boxer both vocalized the need for Democrats to prevail in order to fight for the middle, advocate for the Latino community and overcome financial hardship.
Though Republicans took control of the House of Representatives after Tuesday’s election, experts said Boxer’s re-election helped Democrats maintain control of the Senate.
“The outcome of the California election is important because it keeps the control of the Senate in the hands of the Democrats, which means that there’s one house of the legislature where Democrats get to control the committee structure,” Hollihan said.

Democrat Jerry Brown was elected to his third term as governor of California Tuesday, beating Republican candidate Meg Whitman.
“I take as my challenge forging a common purpose. A common purpose based not on compromise but on a vision of what California can be,” Brown said in his victory speech.
Brown, the current state attorney general and previous California governor from 1975 to 1983, led his campaign on a platform that promised new jobs in the green energy sector and focused on providing funding for California education.
Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
“He had a very effective get out to vote effort and organized traditional democratic constituents,” said Tom Hollihan, a political expert and professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, also pushed for creating California jobs, but through incentives for companies and small businesses to boost the job market. Pension reform was also at the top of her list of goals for the state.
“It looks like in the data that more people said that we need to bring government experience to this table than business experience … even though the economy is a key factor,” said Ann Crigler, interim director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The months leading up to the election saw targeted campaigns from both sides, with Whitman spending a record $141.5 million of her personal money. In total, she spent $160 million on her campaign.
Brown spent $57 million on the campaign, funded primarily by his union backers.
“Brown did a lot more with more limited resources than Whitman, with her many, many millions of dollars,” Crigler said.
Controversy characterized the gubernatorial race in the closing months of the campaign season.
A former housekeeper of Whitman’s came forward alleging that Whitman employed her for nine years as an illegal immigrant. Whitman said she did not know of the housekeeper’s status and said she had provided a false social security number.
A large share of the California constituency is made up of Latino voters, Hollihan said, which is why the controversy with Whitman’s former housekeeper resonated so negatively in the end.
“She had huge vulnerabilities,” Hollihan said. “She was not a particularly likable personality, and likability really matters in politics.”
Brown also faced heat when a voice message emerged featuring someone in his inner circle calling Whitman a “whore.”
“He made small mistakes during the campaign but was usually able to respond to them by making light of them,” Hollihan said.
Brown, 72, was California’s youngest governor when he was elected in 1972, and he is now the oldest governor ever elected in the state.
He visited USC on Oct. 22 during a Moving America Forward rally with Sen. Barbara Boxer and President Barack Obama.
“California has a place for all of us, not just some, not just the ones at the top,” Brown said at the rally., where he spoke about the political impact the state has. “We’re the positive force of change for everybody.”

Many voters who had registered for the election Tuesday were not on the list of registered voters, a problem that also occurred on campus in 2008.

Those registered in Los Angeles County still were able to vote with a provisional ballot, but the problem was so prevalent that polls near USC had to get extra packets of provisional ballot envelopes.
The USC College Democrats had anticipated this problem after the 2008 election and contacted the L.A. County Registrar, which oversees voter registration and ballot counting, over the summer.

“We think that about 80 percent of the people who come here to vote are not going to be registered here, and that’s going to be hundreds throughout the day,” said Micah Scheindlin, political director for the College Democrats. “The registrar assured us this summer that they fixed most of those issues and that election day would go smoothly — clearly, that hasn’t been the case.”
The L.A. County Registrar said that the error was probably because voters sent in their registration too late for it to be included on the rolls.
“If it was close to that date, there would not be enough time to put their names on the roster. And that’s when the provisional voting comes in,” said Audara Rivera, an L.A. County Registrar election assistant. “If the registration got in too late, there’s no time to put their names.”
Provisional ballots are counted after regular ballots but must be included in official election results.
Scheindlin said that the majority of students registered by the College Democrats were not on the list.
The group plans to take this “to the highest places [it] can” to address the problem and has received calls from the Democratic National Committee and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, Scheindlin said.
“This is the fault of the L.A. County Registrar in most cases, and those people are being asked to cast provisional ballots,” Scheindlin said. “We believe hundreds of students today, who were properly registered, will be forced to vote provisionally.”
David Mack, elections supervisor for the poll at USC Hillel, said that the overall turnout was higher than expected and that the station had significantly more provisional votes than normal.
Mack supervised the poll at Our Savior Catholic Center in 2008, when a similar problem occurred. Then, 290 of more than 900 votes were by provisional ballot.
This year, 399 of 500 ballots cast at the Marks Tower poll were provisional ballots.
Daniel Ghyczy, a freshman majoring in political science, voted in Marks Tower.
“I tried registering through my dorm — my R.A. went around with voter registration forms — but I tried registering before in the primary in my hometown. I wasn’t registered to vote like I thought I would be, so I voted provisionally,” Ghyczy said. “Now I have to check online to see if it counted.”
Jessyka Linton, a freshman majoring in political science, said that those registering her at USC didn’t explain what address she should use to register in California.
“I don’t feel like we got an appropriate education regarding the technicalities of voting. I wasn’t told that I should register my USC address, so I registered my home address, which wasn’t helpful for voting here,” Linton said.
I was forced to vote provisionally as well, and I live off campus on Ellendale. My voter registration was confirmed a month before the election. This is infuriating.
