USC women’s basketball associate head coach Laura Beeman has left the program to become head coach at the University of Hawai’i.
Beeman was at USC for two years under head coach Michael Cooper. She also worked with Cooper when he was the head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks for the 2008-2009 WNBA season.
“It’s not often that you have a dream, and that dream comes true,” Beeman said. “To have my first Division I head coaching job at the University of Hawai’i is very, very special.”

Before joining Cooper in Los Angeles, Beeman was head coach at Mt. San Antonio College for 15 seasons.
“Hawai’i definitely has a great, great coach that is going to turn that program around instantly,” Cooper said. “It is not going to take her years to do it. She is going to do it immediately.”
In her two years at USC, Beeman helped the Women of Troy achieve a combined 42 wins and reach the Women’s National Invitation Tournament Championship game in 2011.
The Women of Troy finished third in the Pac-12 conference this year with an 18-win season and a six-game win streak to finish the regular season. They were upset in the first round of the conference tournament by the Washington State Cougars and did not make the cut for the WNIT this year.
Beeman joins two other former USC assistants as head coaches at the University of Hawai’i, including Norm Chow, football, and Gib Arnold, men’s basketball.

Speed kills. Just ask the rest of the Pac-12.
Over the years, the conference has been known for high flyers, the deep pass and lots and lots of points. Then, Chip Kelly came to Oregon and things changed.
Speed wasn’t the only attribute that mattered; raw athleticism combined with speed was the only way to stop the Ducks from putting up 50 on the scoreboard.
It took the Trojans a few years to catch up. Our defense was a little slow at the beginning, and the offense was not fast enough to score as many points as Oregon. That’s why, in 2010, when Oregon came to the Coliseum and won by three touchdowns, things weren’t looking so good.
But coach Lane Kiffin and his coaching staff had a plan. They were going to recruit not just football players, but athletes.
The Trojans needed some track stars on both sides of the ball. Those track athletes were going to put USC back on the map.
Fast-forward to 2011 when the Trojans went 10-2 and took out the Ducks at Autzen Stadium, and the track stars have abounded.
Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who torched Oregon for more than 200 yards in the game, just won the long jump at the recent Trojan Invitational. In his senior year of high school, Lee had the second-best long jump in the country at 24 feet, 8 inches. He won the California Interscholastic Federation in the event and even came in second place in the 100-meter sprint.
Junior cornerback Nickell Robey, the first-team all-conference selection last season, was a long jump champion in his home state of Florida. In the triple jump, he once notched 46 feet.
Sophomore running back D.J. Morgan might be the fastest of the three in track. He was the California 110-meter high hurdling champion in 2009 and notched the fifth-best time ever in the event at the International Assoication of Atheltics Federation Youth World Championships.
Even senior guard Abe Markowitz is in the track mix. He competes in the shot put and came in seventh place at the Cal-Nevada Championships in 2010.
There are several other track athletes that compete on the USC football team, and they are all among the best in their respective competitions. Football players have always been able to transition into the track and field arena. No one can deny that.
But Kiffin’s athletes are truly special and that track athleticism certainly shows on the gridiron.
Lee’s grab against Oregon that scored the first touchdown of the game was a great display of athleticism: Lee waited for a slightly underthrown ball and leapt at the right moment to get his body into position to make a play. The result was one of the best plays of the season. It might not have been his long-jumping prowess alone that got him that touchdown, but the athleticism that he uses in track and field was certainly evident.
Robey’s interception for a touchdown against Stanford’s Andrew Luck? Yes, there was certainly instinct involved; That play was a joy to watch. But the athleticism he demonstrated in the long jump and the quick burst? You can’t say that his track athleticism did not have a part in making that sort of a play.
USC track and field director Ron Allice is lucky to have such talented track stars on his team, that is for certain. But Lane Kiffin is pretty lucky to have those same track stars too. Lee could be a track star and reach the same success that he has had on the football field, but he wouldn’t get the coverage. But it really isn’t a stretch to say that he is nearly as great on the track as he is on football field. And D.J. Morgan? He might actually be better on the track running the hurdles than he is when he’s rumbling through the line of scrimmage.
Dual-sport athletes are nothing new to these times, especially in the track/football realm. But at USC, those track skills show when they play football. And those same track stars have helped the Trojans back to the top of the football mountain once again. Without those track and field members, Oregon would still be a mountain for the Trojans to climb. Because they have those athletes, however, the Trojans reached the top of that mountain at Autzen.
Some coaches do not like their players running track in the offseason; for Kiffin, however, those track stars have been some of his best weapons.

On a day when its starters rode the bench for most of the game, the USC women’s water polo team still managed to cruise to its fifth straight win, an easy 19-5 home victory over No. 19 Hartwick.
Eleven different players scored for No. 3 USC (16-3, 3-1) in the nonconference win over the Hawks (19-8), who had their own three-match win streak snapped.
The relatively short-handed Hawks dressed 11 players -— half of USC’s roster.
Never a doubt · Sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist was one of two USC players to score three goals during Wednesday’s contest. - Adrian Hoffman | Daily Trojan
“We have a lot of depth,” sophomore two-meter Madeline Rosenthal said. “A lot of times it’s intimidating for other teams. It also keeps us fresh and lets us be stronger toward the ends of games.”
Junior two-meter Patricia Jancso led the Women of Troy with four goals, including a buzzer-beater from half-court.
Junior driver Chelsea Silvers tied a career high with three goals, and sophomore two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist also recorded a hat trick.
“It was pretty cool, but I wasn’t really focused on scoring,” Silvers said. “It’s more about finishing opportunities as a team. … When you have the opportunity, take it, but don’t be a ballhog.”
After the Women of Troy jumped out to a 4-1 lead near the end of the first quarter, USC coach Jovan Vavic subbed in more of his seldom-used players, who played most of the match against Hartwick and held strong.
“It’s always great when everyone gets some playing time,” Rosenthal said. “Not a lot of teams can put six girls in with a new wave [of substitutions].”
After Rosenthal and junior driver Dominique Sardo commenced the scoring, Hartwick cut the deficit to 2-1 on a strike from Jemma Dendy Young.
It was the only score that sophomore goalkeeper Flora Bolonyai would concede for the Women of Troy -— from there, USC went on a 9-0 run that spanned over halftime.
“We were just trying to execute the half-court offense that we’ve been practicing,” Rosenthal said. “Everyone has had a lot of practice with that [set].”
It showed. The Women of Troy scored five goals each in the second, third and fourth periods.
After collecting four saves in the first half, Bolonyai gave way to senior goalkeeper Morgan Vickers, who kept up solid defense in the third quarter.
Heading into the final period, USC held a dominating 14-2 lead.
“This program prides itself a lot on its defense, and knowing the system, and executing what the coaches tell us,” Silvers said. “If we execute what we’re supposed to do, then it leads to good things.”
USC’s defense started to slip a little in the fourth quarter, causing coach Vavic to yell, “We aren’t playing defense!” just as Hartwick scored early in the period to make the score 14-3.
Vickers let up two more goals in the fourth quarter, but the Hawks never made a run, as the Women of Troy responded to every Hartwick goal with a score of their own.
The Women of Troy will now prepare for their crucial home match on Saturday against No. 5 California (16-5, 3-1) at 1 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Though it is not the team’s last home game, the squad’s three seniors — Nadia Dan, Kara-Leigh Huse and Vickers — will be honored in a pregame ceremony for Senior Day.

It was a win very much in need.
After starting the season 11-3, the USC baseball team had dropped four of its last seven games headed into a midweek matchup with UC Irvine.
But the Trojans (15-8) bested the Anteaters (14-9) 5-4 behind the bat of centerfielder Garrett Stubbs.
Big win · Sophomore pitcher Bobby Wheatley and the Trojan pitching staff gave up just one earned run over that last 6 2/3 innings against UC Irvine. The Trojans have won consecutive games for the first time since spring break. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The freshman sensation smacked his first career home run in the third inning, his two-run blast giving the Trojans a 3-2 lead, their first lead of the game.
After a laborious first inning in which he faced seven batters and gave up the Anteaters’ first two runs, USC senior starter Brandon Garcia appeared to settle down in the second, retiring Irvine in order.
But he got into trouble in the third, and USC coach Frank Cruz was quick with the hook.
Sophomore Bobby Wheatley came into the game and sent the Anteaters down quietly in the third and fourth, and would have in the fifth as well if not for an error by sophomore shortstop James Roberts that tied the game.
But the Trojans got the lead right back in the sixth. Garcia, having moved into the designated hitter role, smacked an RBI single with runners at second and third.
That was followed up by an RBI knock by freshman second baseman Dante Flores, putting USC up 5-3.
A combination of five Trojan relievers — including Wheatly — held the Anteaters to just two runs (one earned) over the final 6 2/3 innings. After Irvine got one run back in the seventh, senior Martin Viramontes dealt the final innings scoreless to pick up the save, his fourth of the season.
It’s the Trojans first back-to-back wins since before spring break, which gives them some strong momentum headed into a tough conference test with Washington State in Pullman, Wash., this weekend.

The former general manager of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum pleaded guilty Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court to a singular felony charge of conflict of interest.
Guilty · Patrick Lynch, former general manager of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, plead guilty Wednesday to a felony charge. - Daily Trojan file photo
Patrick Lynch, 55, will repay $385,000 in restitution within 45 days and will be placed on three years’ probation, according to reports from the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times. He is expected to serve 1,500 hours of community service and to possibly pay additional fines, as well.
Lynch, along with former Coliseum Events Manager Todd DeStefano, former Coliseum Technology Manager Leopold Caudillo Jr., two rave promoters and a contractor, was named last week in a 29-page grand jury indictment alleging bribery, conspiracy and embezzlement in addition to conflict of interest.
The indictment accuses Lynch, who managed the Coliseum for 17 years before resigning in February 2011, of knowingly accepting and permitting bribes for raves and other events held at the taxpayer-funded venue.
Lynch pleaded guilty to one of the six felony counts he faced. Under the plea agreement, he will not serve any jail time and will be eligible to apply to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor following his three-year probationary period.
He faced up to 15.5 years in prison, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Lynch, DeStefano and Reza Gerami, owner of the rave promoting company Go Ventures, Inc., were arrested last Thursday. Pasquale Rotella, the founder of Insomniac Events, turned himself in to authorities the following day.
DeStefano is currently charged with receiving more than $1.8 million in payments and bribes from Gerami and Rotella.
All three have pled not guilty.
The Coliseum Commission, the stadium’s nine-member governing body, filed a lawsuit against Lynch and DeStefano in November, alleging that they had mismanaged funds.
USC has been a tenant at the Coliseum since it opened in 1923. The university has also been in negotiations with the commission since September to obtain operational control of the facility.
Does this now mean we will get beer back at the SC home games?  $385k would buy lots of kegs…

The USC Career Center and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs held the first annual career conference for Ph.D. students Wednesday. The event, Beyond the Ph.D., aimed to discuss how Ph.D. students might use their degrees in the job market, regardless of whether they seek professions in teaching, industry or government.
Ph.D. · Amy Braden, a program administrator, and Michael Block, a postdoctoral teaching fellow, speak at Beyond the Ph.D. on Wednesday. - Jessica Badrous | Daily Trojan
Despite their academic expertise, individuals with advanced degrees often have trouble finding a suitable career, said Richard Reis, the executive director of the Alliance for Innovative Manufacturing at Stanford University.
He said working in academia as a professor or assistant professor, for example, is usually considered the optimal choice. Reis said teaching positions are limited, however, and the field is becoming increasingly competitive.
Reis also said employers outside of academia see Ph.D. holders as too academically focused and tend to favor job experience over extensive research on a specific topic.
A panel of Ph.D. recipients and experts in science, technology, engineering and mathematics explained why more education does not always translate into better career opportunities.
“You’re really autonomous as a Ph.D.,” said Peter Baumeister, senior manager of medical information at Amgen. “The problem is that in industry you really have to work with teams.”
During the panel, Eric Schulze, a staff fellow at the Food and Drug Administration, described how employers view Ph.D. students.
“Post-doctoral studies are sometimes seen as a waste of time and expertise,” Schulze said. “Employers take that into account.”
Current USC students at the event had mixed opinions about their professional futures.
“I’m getting ready to graduate, so right now I’m thinking about a career,” said Tsutomu Shimizu, a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering. “But industry’s not for me, because usually they’re expecting industrial experience.”
Chris Berry, a Ph.D. student studying electrical engineering, has observed that job availability is largely based on a student’s field of study.
“I worked for five years before beginning my Ph.D.,” Berry said. “In industry, I feel like there are a lot more positions for scientists than there are for people studying the humanities.”
Reis, who produces the online newsletter Tomorrow’s Professor, lectured on potential solutions to these problems. He said students should focus on “breadth on top of depth” to prepare for careers in academia, government and industry to gain a hiring advantage in a field where teaching positions are becoming increasingly difficult to secure.
“There’s been pressure put on, especially in the arts and humanities, to explore alternatives to tenure-track positions,” Reis said.
This pressure is especially concerning when graduate students’ workloads are taken into account. According to a UC Berkeley study, 95 percent of Ph.D. students have felt overwhelmed at some point in their graduate career, and 67 percent reported feeling hopeless or depressed.
For a student constantly conducting research, meeting with professors and attempting to write a thesis, worrying about a career makes life as a graduate student all the more daunting, said Shu Cai, a doctoral student studying computer science.
“I plan to go into industry, with academia as a second choice,” Cai said. “But the job market is not good right now, and I’m not expecting it to be any better after graduation.”
It’s because Ph.D.s are automatons; they’re stuck in ivory towers of academia i.e. they’re too left-brained in their approaches to people, life, etc. They’re awkward and off in their perceptions to what really goes on in the real world. The worse is when you’re pursuing a humanities, artsy, or other non-STEM discipline, and professors of these say corny clichés like “the world is at your grasp; believe in yourself; you can do anything with this degree; follow your passion…” mumbo jumbo. I got many relatives, friends, acquaintances, etc. who hold advanced degrees in futile things like linguistics, pyschology, and the likes from “high & mighty” places like Cal Berkeley, that school across town, and others who qualify for nothing more than working the front lines at Targét for a little more than minimum wage. The notion that “advanced degree = propitious upward mobility” is a myth. Maybe it was true years ago, but the bad economy essentially hit the “reset button” to the game of life. Higher education is no longer a sure shot. MDs are the only real degree; people are always sick and dying.

Former First Lady of California and journalist Maria Shriver will speak at the Annenberg Communication Commencement on May 11 at 10:45 a.m. in McCarthy Quad, after the USC commencement ceremony.
Larry Gross, vice dean, School of Communication director and professor, said Shriver’s speech will be inspiring and relevant to graduating communication students at USC.
“We’re very pleased that she’s agreed to come and speak,” Gross said. “She’s been devoted to improving possibilities and careers for women, particularly in communications, and that applies to a lot of our graduates.”
In addition to serving as California’s First Lady from 2003 to 2010, Shriver is a Peabody- and Emmy Award-winning journalist and producer, and authored six New York Times bestselling books. She is also an advocate for people with intellectual disabilities and has worked to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s disease.
In 2009, Shriver partnered with the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy and other organizations to launch The Shriver Report: A Women’s Nation Changes Everything, a study that reveals women’s progress in the workforce and its impact on American society.
Elizabeth Krane, a senior majoring in communications looks forward to hearing what Shriver has to say.
“I’ve heard of her, but I don’t really know much about her. I’m sure she will [have something valuable to say],” Krane said.
Kristy Pyke, a senior majoring in public relations, said that Shriver is an inspiration for women in communication.
“It is an honor to have such a strong-willed, inspirational woman like Maria Shriver as our commencement speaker,” Pyke said. “She has truly come to represent the modern day woman, and I am thrilled to hear what advice she has to give my graduating class.”
Journalist Christiane Amanpour is the speaker for the journalism and public relations ceremony.

Samantha Castillo (right), a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, and members of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation simulate a Cambodian sweatshop, where USC merchandise is made, in front of the Pertusati Bookstore on Wednesday. The simulation advocated for the university to become a member of the Worker Rights Consortium.
[Correction: A previous version of this caption stated that these are members of the Student Coalition for Labor Exploitation. The organization is called the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]

Appears simulated demonstration to raise awareness is very positive.  Joining the Worker Rights Consortium sounds like a good idea.  Why not?

The USC acceptance rate decreased by more than four percentage points this year. Of the 46,000 freshman applications received, around 8,400 applicants were accepted, Dean of Admissions Tim Brunold said.
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the USC acceptance rate decreased by 4 percent; the rate decreased by four percentage points. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
A group of 1,000 spring admits will also receive acceptance letters.
Last year, more than 37,000 prospective freshman students applied to USC and 8,450 were offered admission.
Brunold said the pool of accepted students is the most accomplished group yet to be offered admission to the school.
“These are among the best students who are applying to college this year,” Brunold said. “Most of them will be ranked in the top five to 10 percent in their graduating high school class.”
The school’s acceptance rate reached an all-time low of 18 percent, compared with 22.7 percent last year.
Nearly half of the admitted students are from California and 14 percent of admits are international applicants. Brunold said every state in the United States is represented in the admit pool and states such as Texas, New York and Illinois are among the higher-represented states outside of California.
“These are all students who have many choices,” Brunold said. “And it isn’t often that USC is their only choice or best choice.”
Brunold also said the group is more ethnically diverse than last year’s group of admitted students. The number of students deemed as underrepresented college minorities (Latino, black, Native American, Pacific Islander) increased from 19.5 percent in 2011 to 20.5 percent this year.
The school also saw an increase in the number of first-generation college students. Of the 8,400 accepted applicants, 1,000 will be the first in their families to attend college, Brunold said.
“We are well-poised to meet all of our enrollment goals next year,” Brunold said.
USC expects about one-third of admitted applicants to enroll at the university.
Brunold said because of the budget cuts facing the UC and Cal State system, USC might be a more appealing alternative to the public higher education system.
“Many of the families who have been engaged with us in this process understand the benefits of an independent private education,” Brunold said. “People like small classes, people like the ability to graduate in four years, people like the diversity. However, we all benefit from a strong public higher education system in the state.”
Applications were sent out Wednesday and admitted students have until May 1 to accept or decline admission.
When you include the spring admits, it decreased by 2.3 percentage points, so the overall acceptance rate is 20.4%.
The acceptance rate dropped by four PERCENTAGE POINTS, from 22.7 percent to 18 percent.  This distinction is essential.  There were TWENTY percent fewer acceptances given the big increase in the applicant pool (4.7 divided by 22.7).

Pacific Standard Time
Saturday, March 31
Locations and times vary
Pacific Standard Time has been the dominating force in the art world, and pretty much everywhere for that matter, in recent months. Sadly, the expansive exhibition series is slowly but surely coming to a close.
Though it has been ever-present in our lives, many of us have yet to see any of the 69 exhibitions dispersed across the city.
To give you that one last necessary motivator, Pacific Standard Time is providing free admission to 20 of the remaining exhibitions Saturday, March 31.
Some especially worthwhile exhibitions worth checking out include The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art and USC’s Fisher Museum of Art.
Additionally, many of the museums and galleries will hold special programs, such as guided tours and concerts.
That sounds like an incentive if we ever heard one.
 
Seth and Ed’s Puppet Talk Show
Saturday, March 31 at 10 p.m.
Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre
We grew up with Sesame Street and laughed at the inappropriate humor of Avenue Q — our generation is quite fond of puppets.
So celebrate your puppet love with Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre’s Seth and Ed’s Puppet Talk Show.
The fresh take on talk shows is hosted by Seth Morris of Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ed Helms of The Office and The Hangover. With such comedic genius, among a number of sure-to-be-hilarious guest stars, you’re bound to have a side-splittingly good time. Not to mention, Upright Citizens Brigade Theater is one of Los Angeles’ leading improv theaters.
Mark your calendar: Saturday is sure to be a riot. As for admission, tickets cost $10 and can be purchased on the Upright Citizens Brigade website.
Are you ready to laugh? Of course you are.
 
Spring Awakening
Arena Stage at Theater of Arts
Every Thursday-Sunday at 8 p.m. until April 22
If the b-tch of living — or just school — is starting to get to you, unwind with a little bit of musical theater. The Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening, directed by Kate Sullivan, is currently running at Arena Stage at Theater of Arts and features a young, talented cast of local actors, including a dynamic Matt Vairo in the lead role of Melchior.
The show, adapted from the controversial 1893 play of the same name by Frank Wedekind, follows a group of teenagers as they struggle with the pressures of adolescent life — primarily, sexual frustration. With an acclaimed script and clever, well-crafted songs, Spring Awakening shines as a must-see production.
 
Robben Ford
Thursday, March 29-Saturday, March 31; shows at 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.

Catalina Bar & Grill
Grammy-nominated guitarist Robben Ford has quite the history: He first came to prominence with Miles Davis, the legendary perfectionist jazz trumpeter, and has since cultivated a reputation as one of the finest modern blues guitarists performing today. Ford is also noted for his prolific contributions to other big names: He has worked with George Harrison, Joni Mitchell and Gregg Allman, among others.
Now he’s stopping in Los Angeles for a stint at the Catalina Bar & Grill, and is performing twice each night from Thursday through Saturday. That’s a good thing — though Ford might not be hitting the Top 40 charts anytime soon, his live shows are worth experiencing for any fans of great guitar music.

There’s a lot to look forward to in comics this year. DC Comics brought in some of the best writers and artists for the Before Watchmen books, and its relaunched core titles are picking up steam.
Marvel is starting its big company-wide crossover, Avengers vs. X-Men that will take up the summer in a slew of tie-ins. And, on top of that, some of the biggest comic book movies in recent memory come out this summer.
Despite all this, it’s the independent, creator-owned comic books that might be the best part of 2012. Some of the best creators in comics are releasing their own original series in the next few months that look to be among the most enticing books on the market.
But what’s so special about creator-owned books? It’s partly the fact that for decades, they didn’t really exist. When comics took off in the 1930s, writers and artists were usually doing two things: selling creative rights to comic book companies — like what Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster did with Superman — or working on pre-existing characters.
By the 1990s, however, many creators wanted a change. Comics were becoming more experimental and branching out into different areas as unpopular genres like horror re-emerged. The biggest shift came when a group of very popular creators left Marvel in 1991 to found Image Comics the next year.
Image was a company dedicated to protecting creators’ rights and not interfering editorially, helping to kick off a boom in creator-owned titles. Granted, it was the early 1990s and over-the-top, grim and gritty art was fueling a speculator’s market, leading to poorly reviewed books and a market crash.
But Image and other companies moved forth and fostered a shift as creator-owned titles gained prominence. During the 1990s, series such as Mike Mignola’s Hellboy and Kurt Busiek’s Astro City launched, and new creators found outlets in places like Dark Horse Comics or IDW Publishing. These new series touched on every genre and were genre-busting as well. It was a great period for original ideas, which helped revitalize the comic book industry at the turn of the century.
In a way, that’s the beauty of creator-owned works. They can be sprawling epics like Robert Kirkman’s superhero saga Invincible told over dozens of issues, or they can be more intimate miniseries like Brian Wood and Ryan Kelly’s Local. These series are essentially blank slates upon which the creators can build intricate, odd and unique worlds.
Playing in the larger sandbox with shared universes or licensed properties can be fun, but there’s something about seeing a creator uninhibited by restraints that makes these titles so interesting. These are the pet projects they’ve been planning for a long time, and the end result is usually enticing.
So what makes 2012 such a great year for creator-owned comics?
Some of the best writers and artists in comics are teaming up for new, creator-owned titles.
Grant Morrison, the mad genius behind The Invisibles and All-Star Superman is launching Happy! at Image at the end of the year. No details are known, but he is working with artist Darick Robertson, who illustrated Warren Ellis’s gonzo journalism epic Transmetropolitan.
Meanwhile, Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips are in the middle of their new series, Fatale. The duo, which has alternated working on the noir-filled Criminal and pulp superhero series Incognito, are mashing up demonic horror with gritty crime. So far it’s a great series that plays to the creators’ strength while adding a creepy twist.
And Nathan Edmonson announced Where is Jake Ellis?, the sequel to his Mediterranean-trotting spy thriller Who is Jake Ellis. And Brian K. Vaughan, writer of Y: The Last Man and Ex Machina, returned to comics after a year long hiatus with a sci-fi fantasy series Saga, an ongoing epic that manages to mix high concept with great character drama.
On top of that, Dark Horse has its Dark Horse Presents title, a revived anthology that gives creators opportunities to try out stories that don’t yet have their own title.
The pulp-loving Francesco Francavilla is serializing a Black Beetle — the writer-artist’s new pet project — story in the magazine, and Brian Wood and Kristian Donaldson wrapped up their prologue to The Massive, a new series launching this summer.
It’s Wood’s thematic followup to his high concept, urban-focused war series DMZ and will definitely be one of the best books this year.
Creator-owned series not only protect the works of writers and artists, but give them more room to tell their own stories. And 2012 looks to be a year full of new ideas.
It’s not just a good year for comic creators, it’s a good year for readers.

Mr. Mike Richardson? ‘THE’ Mike Richardson giving insight here??? Wow… Talk about being humbled… This is a perfect example of why Dark Horse Comics has been such a succesful and respectable company all these years… and I’ll give you one more…
DHC is like the ONLY publisher out there that accepts story submissions even if you’re an “unknown” living outside the U.S. They’re just asking for QUALITY STUFF. And for that, you have my “eternal gratitude” Mr. Richardson… I’m submitting my first story in a couple of months, for 2012 remains promising for ‘aspiring comic creators’ indeed thanks to Dark Horse…
I live in Mexico City. 20 years ago, I started collecting comic books. My very first comic book was published by DHC (an Alien 3 movie adaptation) and of all 500+ titles I possess, what I consider is the finest ‘single issue story’ in the comic book artform to this day was also published by DHC (Ghost #6, vol.1); of that issue alone I have 2 near mint copies. Nuff said.
Nicholas,
A nice article with good intentions, but you need to learn your comics history. Dark Horse was founded in the mid ’80s with the goal of providing creators a place to bring their work and own it. The Image founders were inspired by the creators who brought their projects to Dark Horse, people such as Frank Miller, Paul Chadwick, Walt Simonson, Geof Darrow, Mike Mignola, Bob Burden, and dozens of others. This was long before Image and nearly 20 years before IDW. Dark Horse was one of the pioneers of creator rights and continues to offer creators a place to bring their projects today. 
All the best,
Mike Richardson

With electronic dance music beginning to dominate today’s popular music charts, it is no surprise that DJs with relative success thus far are now gaining more recognition.
EDM · As electronic dance music has grown in popularity, so has DJ and producer Felix Cartal who mixes vocal and non-vocal tracks on his new release Different Faces in order to create a more diverse, eclectic sound. - Photo courtesy of Scott Loudoun
This is especially the case for DJ and producer Felix Cartal, whose new full-length album, Different Faces, dropped Tuesday.
Though Cartal might be an unfamiliar name to many, he has a prolific body of work. Cartal has two releases off star-DJ Steve Aoki’s Dim Mak label — the Skeleton EP (2009) and full-length album Popular Music (2010) — and has also done remixes for popular EDM artists including Etienne de Crecy, John Dahlback, Wolfgang Gartner and MSTRKRFT. His work has also been remixed by the likes of Harvard Bass, John Dahlback and Laidback Luke.
Different Faces, however, marks Cartal’s transition toward producing tracks geared toward a wider audience while keeping elements of the electro-house genre that are prominent in his older songs, including the hits “World Class Driver” and “The Joker.” Cartal’s versatility is exemplified by the contrasting beats and styles he employs on Different Faces, creating an amalgam of both Top 40-esque beats and tracks that retain his original instrumental electronic sound.
In an appeal to EDM newcomers with an affinity for vocal dance tracks, Cartal offers tracks like “H.U.N.T.,” “Higher,” “Don’t Turn on the Lights” and “Black to White,” which sound as if they were produced to be dance club tracks. “H.U.N.T.,” for example, features a repetitive yet catchy electronic beat and pulsing bass in combination with the growling vocals of former dance punk band Death From Above 1979 singer Sebastien Grainger. “H.U.N.T.” is definitely a contender to be a summer smash hit in the electronic scene, especially with a chorus that flaunts the sing-along line “H-U-N-T / Are you with me?”
The fourth track on the album, “Higher,” also features dance-punk influences, here courtesy of British band New Ivory. “Higher” works as a continuation of the growly, punk male vocal stylistics featured on “H.U.N.T.,” only here layered on top of a fast-paced electronic beat.
The album’s first single “Don’t Turn On The Lights” is also noteworthy. The song shows off Cartal’s interpretation of a poppy, mainstream electro beat and features the powerhouse androgynous vocals of Polina, who has also contributed to tracks by Kaskade and Aoki. It’s an easily danceable track that should be a staple in any party or club playlist.
The album’s recently released third single, “Black To White,” impresses. The track starts off with a piano riff oddly similar to that in MSTRKRFT’s “Heartbreaker” and develops an infectious, bass-heavy beat. “Black and White” is another song that seems to have major potential to be a club hit. It’s topped off by the talents of Miss Palmer, the vocalist on Aoki and Afrojack’s track “No Beef,” who here lays down vocals that syncopate beautifully with the beat.
In addition to Cartal’s obvious talent on the production of club-worthy tracks, he also shines in non-vocal house tracks — including “Triple Deke,” “Domo,” and “The Race” — that diverge from the more mainstream sound featured in the rest of the album and form an aural balance.
“Triple Deke” strays away from safe, power-pop electro and touches on Cartal’s electro roots with a touch of trance. The track hearkens back to Cartal’s classic bass drops heard in older tracks like “The Joker,” but with a new edge that could be compared to a cross between the sound of Calvin Harris and The Bloody Beetroots: a heavy electronic beat with lighter, funky synthesizers layered on top.
“Domo,” the second single released in February, follows up a straightforward electro-house build up with a completely unexpected drop that shows off Cartal’s original style of production. Though there are no vocals on this track, it has the potential to be a big hit wherever Cartal drops it live.
Cartal aims to please old fans and new alike with Different Faces and successfully crosses the lines of classic electro, mainstream EDM and dance punk. He does an effective job and cleverly uses different resources, featuring vocalists from various backgrounds and crafting unique-sounding beats throughout the album.
Producers, DJs and electronic music aficionados alike will find it in their best interest to invest in Cartal’s upcoming release: After all, Different Faces is a collection of some of the hottest new electro tracks.

With two albums that debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, two top-20 crossover hits and a third album on the way, VIBE magazine didn’t exactly shock the world when it declared Plies the “future of hip-hop” at the end of 2008, and the magazine certainly wasn’t alone in the prediction.
But after the Florida native’s third album, Da REAList, was met with lukewarm reviews and 2010’s Goon Affiliated failed to produce a top-40 hit, Plies has faded from the hip-hop and rap limelight.
Let down · Plies was critically and popularly acclaimed, but despite this initial success, he has slowly faded out of the limelight. This year in hip-hop, however, offers a number of artists aching to do what Plies could not. - Photo courtesy of Patrick Hoelck
Pop, rock, country and R&B often spawn hit makers who last for years, but as Plies and countless other MCs with plenty of hype but no bite have shown, hip-hop is simply a difficult genre to prognosticate.
It wasn’t too surprising to see Katy Perry’s “Part of Me” follow the pop diva’s last five songs into the Billboard Hot 100 top-five this winter, yet you would have been hard-pressed to find many who thought Tyga would have not one, but two crossover hits on his hands this year in “Rack City” and “Faded.”
But the genre always seems to be looking for the next big thing, whether it finds it or not. And with no highly anticipated major releases on the horizon until B.o.B.’s Strange Clouds hits shelves May 1, the attention of the rap community has turned squarely to the radio single format to find its next big hit. But who will it come from?
Here are a few of the most recent singles to hit the airwaves that could hold the rap community over if or when Drake’s Take Care stops spitting out hit after hit.
 
“Take It To The Head” — DJ Khaled feat. Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross
DJ Khaled made his name by assembling and producing posse tracks just like “Head,” which will serve as the lead single for his upcoming Kiss the Ring.
This time Khaled has outdone himself, bringing together four of the biggest names in hip-hop while collaborating with production team The Runners to produce what looks to be his most radio-friendly single since 2010’s ubiquitous “All I Do Is Win.”
Sure, last summer’s “I’m On One” dominated rap radio until ‘Ye and Jay stormed onto the scene, but like “Win,” “Head” has crossover appeal and potential.
With Brown screaming out every note as if sex were the only thing on his mind and Wayne and Minaj spitting in a more laid-back, slow-flow fashion alongside molasses king Ross, “Take It to the Head” has all the makings of a hit.
 
“Richard” — Obie Trice feat. Eminem
Obie Trice has spent the last 12 years making himself into one of the more respected names in the  hip-hop game.
But he’s probably still best known for his cameo on Eminem’s 2002 smash “Without Me” — you remember, “Obie Trice / real name no gimmicks” and “And Moby? / You can get stomped by Obie,” right?
On “Richard,” however, the two find their roles reversed. A play on a nickname for someone named Richard that probably gave everybody the giggles in middle school actually comes out as a well-produced, entertaining collaboration between Trice and his mentor.
The most anticipated single off Trice’s upcoming Bottoms Up lives up to the hype this time, as the Statik Selektah-produced track has Trice admitting to his lack of name recognition but warning “Take it back Selektah, let ‘em know it’s Trice / Put your seatbelts on, we gon’ ride tonight.”
 
“The Don” — Nas
After last summer’s “Nasty” got people talking about Nas’ return to the styles and flow that made Illmatic — the Queens-bred rapper’s now-legendary debut album — a hip-hop classic, many wondered if anything else on the upcoming Life is Good could match up.
While “The Don” is certainly not “One Love,” the beat has more of an immediate impact than “Nasty” — the Super Cat reggae sample combined with drum claps will have supporters of the more traditional East Coast hip-hop running for their iTunes when Life is Good appears.
Leave it to the late Heavy D, who co-produced the song, to leave Nas with something so simple but so infectious.
Nas is at his best when his razor-sharp lines also speak to the truth of New York as he sees it, and when “The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens / It’s all about surviving, same old two step” is laid over Super Cat’s “New York girls, dem a mad ova wi,” that’s exactly what we get.

Summer break is quickly approaching. Many students are spending their final five weeks planning vacations. Exotic lands, different cultures and pleasurable sights await those who choose to leave the country. But before students enjoy these lands, cultures and sights, they must undergo the much-loathed process of air travel.
Cooper Haskell | Daily Trojan
Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration released an annual report revealing a bleak future for airline travelers. This year, in the United States alone, 732 million airline passengers will take flight. The numbers are forecasted to grow annually, eventually to 1.2 billion by 2032.
If airline travel is a hassle now, imagine what it will be like when that number doubles in two decades.
There will be twice as many travelers checking in bags, waiting for security clearance and complaining that they have to sit next to a crying infant.
We should all reconsider other forms of travel. Trains, boats and automobiles have many advantages. You will enjoy the journey as well as the destination, which is more than air travelers can claim.
The struggle begins early on. When driving into the departing tier, a flood of traffic instantly hits. Taxis screech by, buses plow through, pedestrians straggle, sirens scream and loud speakers bark.
Then come the dreaded checkpoints, which are a complete waste of time for those unlucky drivers asked to stop, including myself.
At one checkpoint, an officer took the time to insult my car. “Your car is filthy and your headlight is out,” he said. “Is that bird crap?”
Security checkpoints are even worse. The lines grow long and the people grow impatient, enduring the interminable wait as best as they can. They stand in their socks as the air begins to turn as stale as the inside of a McDonald’s playhouse.
Flight delays are another common issue. They can quickly snowball into a traveler’s worst nightmare.
Imagine you’re on a business trip, and your flight is delayed — delayed, delayed and finally canceled.
The airline places you on the standby list while your traveling partner is placed on a flight the next morning.
You are separated. You have to navigate an unfamiliar city, look for the unfamiliar hotel your company reserved and pitch a product alone.
Thankfully the FAA began “undertaking the largest transformation of air traffic control ever attempted” according to its official website, referring to its new system called NextGen. The system will entirely restructure the handling of air traffic. This means quicker landings, quicker flights and, ultimately, fewer miles flown.
Until the FAA’s transformation occurs and upholds the claims declared on its website, staying away from airports is not a bad idea.
Consider other forms of travel that allow you to experience pleasant surroundings and not the snorer, drooler, crier, belcher, farter or hurler sitting next to you.
It’s a horror many of us have survived and would wish upon no one.

Right, because of the few hassles that exist, I should instead drive, boat, or take a train?? If someone needs to travel even a few hundred miles, flying is worth it simply because of the time savings from it.  Sure, the flight can get delayed, but in the 4 years I have been at USC flying back home about 10 times a year, this is very rare.
As long as people need to travel, flying will always be the preferred choice of transportation because the time saved is worth much more than the few hassles that come with flying
I fly a lot. I go to school here, but I go to the East Coast probably six or seven times a semester. I never have any of these problems. I expect to fly a lot for the rest of my life. It’s never been a problem, and it never will be. Suggesting that alternative means of transport be considered is idiotic, especially for long-haul flights. I was in Europe over spring break, for example. 10.5 hours to LHR, then another few to my final destination. How long would that have taken by ship?
Flying is a critical part of life. Denying that will make your world very, very small.
Andrew, you have way overdrawn this flying bit.  In fact, your artwork is so fantastic you might consider becoming one of those comicbook creators as per the article in the DT just above this one.

To stop hazing, lawmakers must amend Matt’s Law.
On Feb. 2, 2005, a young college student by the name of Matt Carrington died as a direct result of a hazing ritual at Chico State University in Chico, Calif. Following his death, Carrington’s family sought to eliminate hazing in California.
Carrington’s family was successful in changing the California Hazing Law in 2006. Signed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Matt’s Law classifies some hazing rituals as felonies: those that result in “death, great bodily injury, or great psychological injury,” according to USC Student Affairs.
While Matt’s Law is a step toward justice, it has not lived up to its intended outcome. Matt’s Law should be corrected and then federalized, as a step toward achieving true justice for Carrington.
First, the law should classify all hazing activities as felonies. As it stands, the current classification of felony hazing as “initiation activities that cause ‘great’ harm” is far too general. This makes it open for interpretation. There is no room for interpretation when dealing with such a dangerous phenomenon. Matt’s Law should also list strict guidelines specifying which fraternity initiation activities are legal and do not count as hazing.
Second, the law should be revised to include mandatory monitoring of initiation processes based on the aforementioned criteria. This monitoring should be conducted by a responsible university faculty member who is hired to oversee initiation processes.
Third, college campuses should mandate that all existing and prospective fraternity brothers take a workshop on the physical and psychological dangers of hazing prior to the beginning of the initiation process. The workshop should inform pledging students of their rights under Matt’s Law.
Through these revisions, it is likely that incentive to adhere to the law will rise. If proven successful on a state level, the revised law should be federalized and applied on a national level.
The Greek system at USC and those across the nation are valuable to our universities’ histories and cultures; at its best, it can foster friendship, community service and leadership. Hazing is antithetical to these values. It is a phenomenon rooted in the uglier side of human nature.
In Carrington’s memory, we should support the revision and federalization of Matt’s Law to once and for all correct the ill in a system that should be upheld for its otherwise socially stimulating, character-shaping and rewarding benefits.

By now you’re probably familiar with the case of Trayvon Martin. Martin is the 17-year-old from Florida who was killed by George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watchman. Martin was unarmed at the time of his death. None of this is up for debate — it’s all been confirmed.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
But does American society truly acknowledge what happened on that night?
I don’t mean to say that we’re not recognizing it, because the media has certainly given the story plenty of coverage.
What I mean is that we’re not accepting the events at face value. We’ve chosen to make the Martin case about a variety of things, including race, law and stereotypes.
What we haven’t focused on is what the case is actually about — the murder of a minor.
The 17-year-old was the latest minor to be killed and to gain national attention in America, where events like this aren’t supposed to occur.
Martin’s honor student status has no bearing on this case. Implying that, because he got good grades, he deserved to live more than someone who didn’t do as well in school is absurd.
The argument that his suspension for possible drug possession somehow makes his death OK is even more absurd. If Martin was really the “thug” that some commentators are making him out to be, implying that he deserved to die more so because of this is ludicrous.
So why do these implications continue to be brought up?
We want to find solace in the case. We want to believe that maybe he brought it upon himself. We want to feel better about our justice system, our country, maybe even ourselves. So we look for flaws as opposed to recognizing the truth.
If we all looked at this case logically, the next rational step would be to ask what to do in the future so Martin’s case doesn’t repeat itself.
For example, it’s almost comical how little the media is discussing gun control. We allow people to purchase guns and we put laws in place that allow them to rely on their best judgment, but we are left with tragedy after tragedy.
If Zimmerman was truly overpowered by a 150-pound 17-year-old, then he obviously counted on his gun to protect himself. If stricter gun control laws were in place, Zimmerman wouldn’t have had a gun to carry. And if he hadn’t had that gun, he most likely wouldn’t have followed a suspicious figure that he viewed as a threat. Nobody would have died.
Gun control can’t just be another aspect of the case that we choose to brush aside. Neither can Florida’s questionable Stand Your Ground law, which gives citizens significant leeway in self-defense.
America needs to really think about the events that occurred. We can’t just look at Martin and Zimmerman. We need to take a look at ourselves.
People are a product of their environment. We have to comprehend why this 17-year-old was killed, and we certainly have to make changes so that similar events won’t take place in the future.
It’s truly a shame that Martin had his life taken away from him. But what about the children who might still have their lives taken away? What about the children we might be able to save?
If we continue to pretend these things don’t happen — not here, not in America — matters will only get worse.
And we’ll have only ourselves to blame.
 
Mat Goldstein is an undeclared freshman. 
YOOOO Everyone follow @HeismanMat on Twitter YO
Let me first give some statistics to put this into perspective. People that carry guns are 43 times more likely to kill a loved one with them than to kill an intruder or assailant. With that fact alone how can anyone in their right mind be pro-gun. 
Mat was not unequivocally asserting that Zimmerman was guilty. Nor was he completely absolving Martin or claiming that this was a matter of racism. This article is looking at the situation from a whole different point of view. It addresses the greater problem this country is facing. Gun availability. 
The right to carry a gun was written into the bill of rights as a precaution that actually made sense at the time. Now, it’s just a hopelessly archaic amendment that bible-thumping, compensating tea-partiers love to cling onto. What are you afraid of? People that tend to conceal and carry tend to be the most sheltered and ignorant people around. They have little perception of life outside of the country, let alone the echelons of their blue-collar suburbs. George Zimmerman, along with the many others that have gunned-down unarmed ‘attackers’ have essentially acted as judge, jury and executioner. Meanwhile, the one in the gutter does not get to tell their side of the story. 
Those dissing the article obviously lack the skill to look at things in a nuanced light. Keep on spouting off your conservative talking points you’ve heard on Fox News and Limbaugh. Ras, speaking of coherence, your comments don’t seem to make any sense themselves. If you had a better grasp of the english language you’d be able to glean more out of this article. And Rich, “bed wetting libs,” really?! You’re the one that feels the need to carry a weapon.  
Hopefully you aren’t USC students because I definitely thought they held their applicants to much higher standards…
“Now, it’s just a hopelessly archaic amendment that bible-thumping, compensating tea-partiers love to cling onto. What are you afraid of?”
I’m afraid of Godless, left-wing zealots who cling to baseless “statistics” and “facts” and view the American Constitution as an archaic document that needs to be shredded.  There are countries that would welcome you and your point of view. Ever consider emigrating?
You’re right, Red State of Mind. Listening to facts and statistics is a tell-tale sign of left-wing extremism. 
Telling me I should leave the country because we disagree? Classic. I suppose I could suggest the same for you. Sick of all the infidels and the separation of church and state here? Iran with its Sharia law is surely the place for you then.
I decided to read this article one more time and see if I could understand the point the author was trying to make. I am sorry to say I still find this OpEd devoid of an opinion. I do not see what point the author made.
Few excerpts…
“We want to find solace in the case. We want to believe that maybe he brought it upon himself. We want to feel better about our justice system, our country, maybe even ourselves. So we look for flaws as opposed to recognizing the truth.”
— what Truth are you referring to? If your point is that we are not discussing the truth it would be nice if you can tell uss what this truth is. Are you referring to gun control or lack thereof as “the truth”? If so what gun control do you propose? Again – you sound like a student immersed in academia and not the real world. You, like many politicians throw around words like “gun control” as a panacea for crime but never describe a plan in detail what such gun control measures would look like.
“If Zimmerman was truly overpowered by a 150-pound 17-year-old, then he obviously counted on his gun to protect himself. If stricter gun control laws were in place, Zimmerman wouldn’t have had a gun to carry. And if he hadn’t had that gun, he most likely wouldn’t have followed a suspicious figure that he viewed as a threat. Nobody would have died.”
— Huh???  Mat, you must live in a very sheltered world protected by mommy and daddy. Are you saying all cops that carry guns do so because they assume all assailants they may face will be larger then them? Dangerous people can come in all sizes. Just look up some most wanted gangbangers – they might weigh less then a buck and a quarter but I bet they would make you soil your Dockers if they approached you late at might.
I wonder how Matt the writer would react if he was being badly beaten in the dark by a hooded thug with no end in sight…and what Matt the writer would do if he had a gun…I guess he would feel so sorry for the plight of the thug he would sacrifice his life to save the thug….if it was me being beaten to death…..both barrels….reload….both barrels.
“What we haven’t focused on is what the case is actually about — the murder of a minor.”
Remember innocent till proven guilty.  This case is still under investigation, and information leaked from law enforcement reviles that this may very well have a case of self-defense.  Reportedly Martin hit Zimmerman in the face, broke his nose, knocked him to the ground, hit his head against the pavement, and tried to take his weapon.  If Zimmerman has the injuries that he claims, that it would be evidence that Zimmerman is telling the truth.  A Grand Jury will hear the case early next month.  Then we hear the true facts of the case.
Furthermore, the photos of Martin that have in the media were evidently taken when he was much younger and therefore much smaller.
Of course, citizen disarmament zealots and groups rushed to judgment in this case.  I believe we need to wait till all the facts are in and the Grand Jury rules and a trail takes place if Zimmerman is indicted.
“We allow people to purchase guns and we put laws in place that allow them to rely on their best judgment, but we are left with tragedy after tragedy.”
The opposite is the case.  Firearms rights have been expanded over last several years, and more citizens are now free to carry firearms in more places.  Yet, homicides, including homicides with firearms, as well as all other violent crime have been decreasing since 2006.  Moreover, after a dramatic increase in firearms sales and ownership after the last Presidential election including an increase in first time firearms purchases and an increase in firearms carry permits, gun ban groups and zealot predicted that there would be a corresponding increase in murders.  However, the U.S. homicide rate decreased from 5.0 per 100,000 in 2009 to 4.8 per 100,000 in 2010.
Preliminary data from 2011 shows Murder is down by 5.7%, Rape down 5.1%, Robbery down 7.7%, and Aggravated Assault down 5.9%

OMG your clueless. Can just any ignorant person write anything they want? This dribble leaves out all the important info on what actualy happened. I thought these Op ED were supposed to be written by real media, not bed wetting libs. Let’s just let criminals walk all over us because we are to afraid to protect ourselves….duh. This kid was floating through a neighborhood that had been hit with mult burglaries…the residents had a right and a duty to be vigilant. And based on what I have read the last two days about Martin himself, and what the witnesses saw, Martin probably knew those committing the burglaries. Did he deserve to die, no….did Martin deserve to be beaten as badly as he was, no…..was the death of Martin a tradgedy, yes….did Martin himself have a hand in his own death, based in the eyewitness and the hard evidence, yes. Does this have anything to do with racisim…not from Zimmermans side it doesn’t.
If you look, dress and act like a gang banger, folks will perceive you to be one, as that’s what you are projecting to the world around you, no matter whether you are one or not.  You must learn to deal with the consequences of your actions.
Mat, your pollyannaish attitude toward the benefits of gun control is both absurd and naive.  Let’s say in we give the government enough authority, God forbid, to go house to house removing every gun they find.  Do you really believe the criminals, whose “livelihood” depend on their weapons, will hand them over to the authorities?  To do so would make them law-abiding citizens which they clearly are not.  So the government would remove all the guns from only the law-abiding citizens leaving us completely defenseless against criminals and a tyrannical government.  Do you follow?
If George Zimmerman is prosecuted and a jury finds him guilty, justice will be served.  But let’s not forget that he is innocent until proven guilty.
Before you give up a constitutional right so easily, please do yourself and those around you a favor and study American history so that you understand WHY we have constitutional rights in the first place.
I am very confused by this article. I am not understanding the point of it.
The SCOTUS is today hearing the case of this Administrations over-reach against personal rights guaranteed in our Contitution.  You advocate another plank that this country was founded and prospered under.
In WW2 the Nazis considered plundering Switzerland but ultimately the Generals convinced Adolf that it was unwinnable because of the fact the Swiss citizenry were all armed and trained.  Switzerland as you know has been a fiercely neutral country for centuries.
Vermont has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country and one of the lowest crime rates.  Vermont is not a very populous State, does not have major cities like  CA or FL but a rural state however you cannot ignore that it is different there with concealed carry.
The Founding Fathers knew what they were doing.  This nation did not arise from the forest and indigenous people without the hard work and strong backing of individual rights as expressed in the US Constitution.

The Oscars are usually the last stop for awards season, but with the announcement of the release date for one of the most anticipated films of the year, we now have a date for when awards season will officially begin this year.
Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master has been scheduled for a release date of October 12, 2012. This marks his sixth feature film and his first in five years.
The film was once “postponed indefinitely” and was soon rescued by financier Megan Ellison. In early March, she dropped hints of a release date of October via Twitter.
The Master stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix and is set in the 1950s, where a maverick starts his own religion after coming home from the horrors of World War II.
The director faced difficulties in financing this film, despite having scored eight Oscar nominations with his previous film, There Will Be Blood. The Master has been faced with controversy over its similarities with L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology.
The October 12 release date positions the film for all fall film festivals, including Toronto, Telluride and New York, where the director’s films have previously premiered.
The Weinstein Company – who knows a thing or two about campaigning for awards season – could decide to skip the film festivals and go straight into theatres.

Performers such as LMFAO, Young the Giant, MGMT, Shiny Toy Guns and Slightly Stoopid were once on the line up for Derby Days, an annual concert geared towards giving back to the community.
This year’s event, which is supported by USC’s Greek life and sponsored by Incipio and Tavik, will be held at the USC McAlister Field on March 31.
An MC and singer from New York, Theophilus London, an Australian DJ duo, Bag Raiders and a blues-rock band, American Royalty will be taking over the Derby Days’ stage.
Tickets are $25 and all proceeds from the night will be donated to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.
According to the Derby Days website, it has donated almost $200,000 to the hospital since 2002. This money has gone towards funding cancer research and preventative education.
Accompanying the night’s performances will be a beer garden, which opens as soon as doors do at 7 p.m.
