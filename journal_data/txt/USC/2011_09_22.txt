The USC men’s water polo team ended last season on a 13-game winning streak.
Similarly, the No. 1 Trojans (5-0) haven’t let up on the gas in 2011, winning their first five games of the season by a margin of 10 goals per contest.
Their crowning achievement, at least thus far, came last week in Stockton, Calif., when the Trojans upended No. 2 UCLA in the championship game of the NorCal tournament.
With a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play set to commence at McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Saturday against No. 8 UC Irvine, the Trojans hope to continue their strong play.
USC’s contest against UC Irvine marks the second time it will face the Anteaters this season, as the Trojans won by a score of 11-3 in the quarterfinals of the NorCal tournament last weekend.
Despite its previous victory, USC has been careful about not underestimating the Anteaters.
“They have a pretty tough team,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “Going into this weekend, we have played them a few times and gotten used to a few of their systems. They’ve got a few things to throw up against us so it’ll be a tough game on Saturday for sure.”
Dennerley, one of the team captains, was named MPSF Player of the Week for his record-breaking performance in the NorCal tournament, where he broke USC’s all-time career saves record. The Australian native is not, however, stopping to reflect.
“It was a great honor to achieve [the record],” Dennerley said. “Obviously that record has been there a long time, and there have been great goalies before me. Going forward for the rest of the season hopefully it sets the tone and leads us into something better — toward the national championship.”
Following their 1 p.m. matchup against UC Irvine, the Trojans will host Golden West Junior College in an exhibition contest, a game that will feature many of its younger, more inexperienced players.
“They’ll give us a good run,” Dennerley said. “It’ll be a good experience; hopefully we’ll get to play some of our guys who don’t get as much water time in some of the other games. We’ll try out a few things and see how it goes.”
One of these younger players is freshman driver Kosta Genidounias. After scoring five goals in the championship game of the NorCal tournament against UCLA and 14 goals in the tournament as a whole, the newcomer has this weekend’s doubleheader to continue to add to the team’s successes.
“I felt really excited [last weekend], especially beating UCLA,” Genidounias said. “It’s an extra motivation. I’m even more excited for this weekend’s game, and next weekend’s Southern California tournament.”

For the USC women’s soccer team, Sunday’s inaugural Pac-12 matchup against Washington State represents a clean slate after a rough beginning to the 2011 season.
Fresh start · USC senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge believes Pac-12 play will be an opportunity for the team to turn its season around. - Jaideep Chadha | Daily Trojan
Despite entering the season ranked No. 25, the Women of Troy have stumbled out of the gate, compiling just a 3-6 overall through its first nine games. Five of those six losses, however, have been by a one-goal margin, giving USC some reason for hope heading into conference play.
“If we can sort ourselves out here and play with a lot more discipline, I think we’ll be all right,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin following his team’s frustrating 2-1 loss to Portland on Sunday. “Hopefully with conference play starting, the ball will bounce our way more than it has been so far.”
USC gets a chance to reverse its fortunes against visiting Washington State at McAllister Field, a team the Women of Troy defeated 3-2 at the same venue last season.
“We expect something different every year,” senior Ashley Freyer said. “We’ll take a look at the scouting report before the game and get an idea of how they’re going to come out. We know they’ll be tough. That’s for sure.”
While USC has found difficulty winning close games, the Cougars have excelled in such situations and arrive in Los Angeles fresh off a 2-1 double overtime victory over Gonzaga, capping a 6-2-1 non-conference run to begin their season.
“We can’t be too worried about what other teams are doing,” Khosroshahin said. “I’ve always thought that if we play our best game, it doesn’t matter who we line up against.”
Coupled with facing an impressive opponent, the onset of Pac-12 play produces possible temptation for teams to change their style of play. The Women of Troy, however, insist that won’t be the case come Sunday.
“We try and keep a balance between realizing that these games are the most important we have and treating them like any other match,” senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge said. “It’s more about a renewed sense of focus than playing the games any differently or anything like that. The rough start has forced us to do that.”
Despite the setbacks to begin the year, players say they view the beginning of conference play as a fresh start rather than an extra layer of pressure to perform.
“I think we recognize that this is a huge opportunity to turn around the season,” Kerridge said. “I think rather than being scared, we look at it from the standpoint that we have nothing to lose. We’re just going to go out there and treat it as what it is: a great opportunity to do something special.”
Freyer, however, believes the team just needs to keep plugging away.
“We’ve got our heads down doing the dirty work right now,” Freyer said. “We’re getting done what we need to get done. Hopefully we’ll perform on Sunday.”
USC’s match against Washington State is the first of three straight Pac-12 games the Women of Troy will play at home before venturing back on the road in the first week of October. Sunday’s match begins at 1 p.m.

As USC prepares for its first road trip of the season, at least one Trojan will feel more comfortable heading to Tempe, Ariz., than the rest.
Junior defensive end Devon Kennard, a graduate of Desert Vista High School in nearby Phoenix has had his sights set on coming home for the past two years.
“I’ve had it on my schedule for a long time,” Kennard said after practice Thursday. “It’s my last opportunity to play in Phoenix. I know a lot of players, a lot of family and friends there, so I’m excited.”
Homecoming · Junior defensive end Devon Kennard, who attended high school in Phoenix, has recorded nine tackles for USC this season. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Kennard, who changed positions this season from linebacker to his original defensive end spot at which he was recruited, has yet to record a sack this year. But that does not mean he has not made an impact thus far.
“I’ve played well so far,” Kennard said. “I’ve got a lot of pressure on the quarterbacks and come really close to some sacks. [ASU] throws the ball a lot, so it’ll give me the opportunity to get some sacks.”
As a player at one of the premier athletic high schools in Arizona, Kennard said he was heavily recruited by Sun Devils coach Dennis Erickson but never seriously considered attending Arizona State.
Kennard has recorded nine tackles on the year, splitting time with juniors Wes Horton and Nick Perry at defensive end.

Freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson, who earned the honor of wearing the legendary number 55 jersey, worn by past linebackers such as Junior Seau, Willie McGinest and Keith Rivers, sat out Thursday’s practice with a sprained left ankle. Dawson was in a walking boot, an ominous sign he most will likely miss Saturday’s game in Tempe.
Dawson’s absence would leave the Trojans without their backup middle linebacker.
USC coach Lane Kiffin said if Dawson were to be ruled out, redshirt sophomore Will Andrew and senior Shane Horton would be in the mix to back up senior linebacker Chris Galippo.
—
Junior left guard Abe Markowitz, who had been the top candidate to start at left guard throughout training camp, will miss the rest of the season after an MRI on Wednesday showed a fractured left foot.
“I’m very disappointed in that,” Kiffin said.  “Obviously, it’s an area of concern for us. He was somebody that we were excited about. He’ll have a long rehab to get back.”
Markowitz suffered an injury to his right foot that caused him to miss last year’s first seven games as well as this year’s spring practice.
Markowitz, who has struggled to stay healthy during his career at USC, has only appeared in one game against San Jose State in the Trojans’ home opener in 2009.
The Trojans will likely start freshman Marcus Martin at left guard this week. Martin made his debut last week against Syracuse.

Fresh off another top-five NCAA finish, the USC women’s golf team looks to build on its strong 2010 campaign as it kicks off its season with the Mason Rudolph Fall Preview in Nashville, Tenn.
Encore performance · Sophomore Sophia Popov looks to lead the Women of Troy to an NCAA title after a stellar freshman campaign. - Photo courtesy of Sports Information
Led by USC coach Andrea Gaston, the 2011 National Golf Coaches Association Coach of the Year, the Women of Troy retain a core of five key starters, including All-American senior Lisa McCloskey and standout sophomore Sophia Popov.
Also returning are sophomore Rachel Morris, junior Cyna Rodriguez and senior Inah Park. The Women of Troy strengthened their lineup with the addition of top freshman recruits Kristen Park and Doris Chen, both of whom are U.S. junior champions.
The loss of Lizette Salas, one of USC’s top performers last season, will hurt the team, but Popov and Gaston maintain that the team’s confidence is not deterred by her departure.
“Our outlook is very bright,” Gaston said. “We have two very good freshmen and five returning starters, so we have a great outlook on what we can do this year.”
The 2010 squad placed in the top five for the sixth straight season and currently ranks second in the Division I College Women’s Preseason Coaches’ Poll, finished with a fifth-place tie in the 2010-2011 NCAA championships. Among their four tournament wins, the Women of Troy earned victories in the 2011 Pac-10 championships and the 2011 NCAA West Regional, yet again cementing their status as top contenders in the nation.
The team’s goals and expectations are running high, especially for Popov, whose freshman season included three first-place finishes as well as both National and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
“We definitely want to win NCAA and just try to lead the pack throughout the season,” Popov said. “Obviously, my expectations coming into the season are pretty high, but I try to keep them low and just want to play solid golf and get into some top 10s.”
Despite her impressive freshman campaign, Popov is keeping an even-keeled approach to the season and not trying to burden herself with the pressure of duplicating last season’s accomplishments.
“I’m under a lot of pressure right now, but I’m just trying to keep expectations low and not think about it too much,” she said.
The Women of Troy begin play today with the 18-team Fall Preview, an event they previously won in 2009, before competing in the Stanford Invitational and Pac-12/SEC challenge throughout October.

Coming off a pair of sweeps of No. 4 Washington and Washington State last weekend, the No. 12 USC women’s volleyball team returns home to face its toughest challenge of the season, No. 1 California and No. 2 Stanford on Friday and Saturday respectively at Galen Center.
Stepping up · Junior outside hitter Kate Fuller finished with 23 kills in two games against the Washington schools as USC swept both matchups. - Daily Trojan file photo
The Women of Troy’s (7-3, 2-1) modest two-game winning streak comes on the heels of a straight-set loss to UCLA at home Sept. 9.
“[Wins] make you feel pretty good as the team continues to gel and it shows we aren’t a one- or two-person team,” coach Mick Haley said. “Beating Washington on the road and sweeping them was exceptionally good and sends a message and now we can see if we do the same thing on our home court.”
While often relying upon senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter, who had nine and 10 kills against Washington and Washington State, respectively, the Women of Troy have seen junior Kate Fuller and sophomore Sara Shaw step in to supplement the USC attack.
Fuller, who has been alternating between the left and right side all season, has come on strong as of late, finishing with 12 kills to one error against the Cougars on Saturday.
Shaw, the 6-foot-2 Texas native, hasn’t been featured much this year, but last weekend she broke out with 23 kills between the two games.
“I think [Shaw’s] starting to play up to her potential and we always felt she could play like this,” Haley said. “We like to get the stability of them [Shaw and Kirby Burnham] bringing it every night and right now Sara’s hot.”
Playing its second first-ranked team this season, USC squares off against Cal hoping to avenge a three-set sweep at the hands of the Golden Bears in last year’s Final Four.
Cal is led by All-American senior outside hitter Tarah Murrey, who leads the Bears with 148 kills this season. Complementing Murrey on the outside is rising sophomore Adrienne Gehan, who is already on pace to shatter her career highs in kills (118, she has 103 so far this season) as the Women of Troy will have their hands full on the outside all day.
While Cal’s strong offense is no secret — it leads the Pac-12 in hitting percentage (.312) — it is it’s strong defense, especially at the net, that sets them apart from other top teams. Top in the Pac-12 in opponent hitting percentage, a staggering .094, the Golden Bears also send out three different girls who average more than a block per game (Kat Brown, Shannan Hawari, and Lillian Schonewise) and both Murrey and libero Robin Rostratter have combined for over 300 digs this season.
“Cal has got the same problems and advantages as we [USC] do and we match up pretty good against them with Jupiter versus Murrey on the outside and Kat Brown versus Lauren Williams in the middle to name a few,” Haley said. “They have a new setter [Elly Barrett] so they have some questions to answer there and I think they’ll have trouble with us and UCLA just like we will against them and Stanford.”
After their bout with Cal, the Women of Troy’s weekend doesn’t get any easier as they face Pac-12 rival No. 2 Stanford. The Cardinal boast what could be the Pac-12’s best defense, leading the conference with 17.88 digs per game and tied for first with 3.02 blocks per game. Though their blocking prowess can be mainly attributed to middle blocker Carly Wopat and her 1.67 blocks per game, the Cardinal’s passing defense boasts four players with 97 plus digs (Rachel Williams, Kyle Gilbert, Hannah Benjamin, and Karissa Cook).
Williams, a sophomore outside hitter, has been Stanford’s go-to player throughout the season as she leads the team in kills (168) and ranks among the team’s best in every relevant statistical category. Part of the Pac-12’s All-Freshman team last season, Williams has brought her game to new heights this year and despite her relatively average height (6-foot), she remains a force on the court.
“The thing about this conference is one-person teams won’t last and but if you have to rely on one girl night in and night out, they’ll end up losing their arms,” Haley said. “If we can control [Rachel] Williams then other Stanford players have to step up, but it’s definitely going to take a team effort to win these two matches.”

Before the USC men’s tennis team can bring an unprecedented fourth consecutive NCAA championship to Heritage Hall, it must begin its journey on the other side of the country.
Chasing history · Senior Daniel Nguyen looks to help lead USC to a fourth straight NCAA championship, which would tie a collegiate record. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Nearly a week after accepting their championship rings last Saturday, the No. 1 Trojans will travel to Cambridge, Mass., to compete against No. 72 Harvard, No. 34 Michigan and No. 10 Texas A&M in the Harvard Crimson Invitational on Friday through Sunday. But 2011 Pac-10 Coach of the Year Peter Smith and company will have their work cut out with them with the absence of senior Steve Johnson, who, after finishing No. 1 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association rankings, opted to forgo his fall semester in preparation for turning professional.
In his place, sophomore Ray Sarmiento, along with seniors Daniel Nguyen and Emilio Gomez, hope to shoulder up the load, with the three entering the season ranked No. 15, No. 16 and No. 66 respectively. As a freshman last season, Sarmiento received ITA All-American honors with Johnson after reaching the NCAA singles round of 16 and winning the 2011 Pac-10 doubles championship with Johnson.
“[Sarmiento] is very athletic,” associate head coach George Husack said. “Last year he matured a lot in playing dual matches and certainly has developed pretty well.”
Nguyen and Gomez each played a large role in topping No. 1 Virginia to clinch USC’s third consecutive championship last spring, and for the second year in a row, Nguyen clinched the championship for the Trojans with a win over No. 34 Sanam Singh. Meanwhile, Gomez went 4-0 in team tournament play, landing him NCAA All-Tournament honors.
The two also received All Pac-10 Honorable Mentions and will help maintain a veteran presence with senior Ben Lankenau for a Trojans team that welcomes four freshmen to the squad.
One of these freshmen is the promising Yannick Hanfmann, who joins the Trojans from Germany. He is ranked No. 2 in ITA Newcomers/Freshmen rankings and No. 932 in Association of Tennis Professionals rankings. Hanfmann’s ATP rank is impressive for his young age, considering no one else from the team is presently ranked.
“[Hanfmann] is one of the best young fellows in Germany,” Husack said. “He’s a big guy with a big game. He still has a lot of maturing and developing to do, but he’s going to help us a lot.”
Sophomores Corey Smith and Michael Grant and freshmen Eric Johnson, John Meadows and Jonny Wang round out the rest of the young, talented roster.
While USC’s aim is unquestionably to notch a fourth straight NCAA title, it insists its focus is on the Harvard Crimson weekend invitational, as it prepares for what might become a historic season.
Woot, go Jeremy!
Hey, Jeremy: At least you could have told your readers dates and more details in case anyone wanted to go.
Thanks for the suggestions, Roger. I mentioned that they would be playing from Friday to Sunday, but I will definitely include more details in the future.

Matt Barkley, Robert Woods, Marc Tyler — a Heisman Trophy candidate, a sophomore stud and a heart-warming story, respectively.
But the stats these three put up wouldn’t be possible without the play of USC’s offensive line.
Clutch · Junior left tackle Matt Kalil has been the unquestioned leader for a young Trojans’ offensive line. Kalil helped preserve USC’s victory against Utah with a blocked field goal in the final seconds of the game. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
Yes, Barkley, Woods and Tyler dazzle with the eye-popping stats. Yes, they make the big, flashy plays.
But without an offensive front that has surrendered two sacks on the year, Barkley doesn’t tie a USC game-high against Syracuse with five touchdown passes; Woods doesn’t have a record-breaking performance against Minnesota; Tyler doesn’t run for 113 rushing yards and a touchdown in his 2011 debut.
To put it in better perspective, No. 23 USC (3-0, 1-0) could easily have been heading into the Arizona State game 2-1. Junior left tackle Matt Kalil’s blocked field against Utah saved overtime, saved a game the Utes would have basically stolen from the Trojans.
Despite the encouragement in seeing USC undefeated at this point in the season, much of that credit should fall on the play of the offensive line (here’s a shout out to the defense, too).
One of the biggest question marks heading into the season were the men protecting Barkley. Losing Tyron Smith, Kris O’Dowd and Butch Lewis to the NFL left a gaping hole on the frontline for the Trojans.
Only Kalil was slated to play a familiar position (left tackle); junior Khaled Holmes transitioned to center from right guard. To fill the other voids, senior Martin Coleman, junior college transfer Jeremy Galten, junior Abe Markowitz, redshirt sophomores John Martinez and Kevin Graf, freshmen Aundrey Walker, Marcus Martin and Cyrus Hobbi would all be competing for playing time and/or a starting position.
A lot of unknowns. A lot of uncertainty.
Fast-forward to week one against Minnesota. The starting offensive line gave Barkley enough time to complete 34 passes, which was enough time to connect with Woods 17 times. Both tied USC single-game records. Even more importantly, it didn’t allow a sack.
Against Utah, the offensive line matched up against a strong front-seven, one the coaching staff knew would be a difficult task for its young, inexperienced unit.
“I would say this is the best front four we’ve seen and had to face,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “The front-seven in general is really, really good and dominant at times.”
Despite this, the Trojans created enough running room for Tyler to gain 113 yards on the ground.
Kiffin even appeared to trust his young unit in week two, electing to run the ball 39 times compared to 32 pass attempts as opposed to just 45 pass attempts and 28 rush attempts against Minnesota.
In week three, it was much of the same. Though Barkley tied a USC game-high record with five touchdown passes, the offensive line controlled the Orange’s defensive front.
The Trojans’ running backs gained 175 yards on the ground, averaging almost six yards per carry.
Even more telling are the penalties the USC offensive line hasn’t committed.
The offensive line had five penalties against Minnesota (two delay-of-games, two false starts and one illegal block). But for a unit playing its first game together, that’s respectable.
It has shown much improvement from week one committing just two penalties combined against Utah and Syracuse — one delay-of-game against the Utes and one false start against the Orange.
Though not a lot of people have talked about this front-five, except for Kalil’s game-saving block, this line has quietly done its job, much like it always has for USC football.
During the days when LenDale White and Reggie Bush ran buck wild against opposing defenses, it was an offensive line that gave them the running room. It was an offensive line that gave Matt Leinart enough time to sit in the pocket and drop perfect passes to the outstretched arms of Mike Williams and Steve Smith.
The offense outside of this offensive line is getting the attention, but this unit will quietly do what it has always done.
It will continue to make plays, it will continue to fight to win the battle in the trenches.
Somebody’s got to do the dirty work; somebody’s got to protect the star quarterback; somebody’s got to make running holes for the tailback.
These players should receive the credit they rightfully deserve.

Not since 1999 has USC lost to Arizona State.
The Trojans, during the past decade, have won 11 consecutive games over the Sun Devils, including five on the road in Tempe, Ariz.
It’s hard, as a result, to fault the No. 23 Trojans (3-0, 1-0) for feeling at least a little confident heading into Saturday’s nationally televised showdown with Arizona State (2-1, 0-0).
Road test · USC junior quarterback Matt Barkley, who has thrown for 892 yards and nine touchdowns through three games in 2011, leads a young, inexperienced offense in its first road game of the season at Arizona State. The Trojans finished with a 5-2 overall mark on the road a season ago. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“The only way we’ll lose is if we beat ourselves,” USC freshman linebacker Hayes Pullard said, who is tied for first on the team with 1.5 sacks. “The defense is coming together really well, so I don’t think that’ll happen.”
Despite its undefeated mark, first-place positioning in the Pac-12 South standings and a return to the Associated Press top-25 poll as of Sunday, USC enters its first road game of 2011 as underdogs for the first time all season.
“We need to make sure we’re mentally ready,” Pullard said.
And for good reason.
Through three games, Arizona State is averaging 33 points and 457 yards per game. Its quarterback, 6-foot-8 junior Brock Osweiler, is completing 66 percent of his passes for 871 yards and six touchdowns.
“You just don’t see that size, period,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “So it’s very unique, very rare and he causes us a lot of issues because he can move around and he’s so accurate and he’s got such a big arm. He can do everything.”
Despite opening the season with back-to-back victories, including a thrilling overtime victory over then-No. 21 Missouri, the Sun Devils’ modest two-game winning streak came to an end last Saturday at Illinois, falling 17-14 to the Fighting Illini.
While Osweiler, who threw two interceptions, and the offense sputtered in defeat, the defense looked all the more stifling — surrendering just 240 total yards, including 2.3 yards per rush attempt.
Heading the defensive unit is junior linebacker Vontaze Burfict, a 2010 first-team All-American, who had nine tackles against Illinois. Last season Burfict had 89 tackles, 54 solo.
“They don’t make too many 245-pound guys that can run like him,” Kiffin said. “That’s why he should definitely leave this year and go to the NFL and be a first round pick. When he wants to turn it on, look out.”
Fortunately for USC, its offense appears to be hitting its stride.
In its 38-17 victory over Syracuse, the Trojans amassed more than 500 total yards, while junior quarterback Matt Barkley tossed five touchdown passes, tying the school single-game mark for the third time in his career.
 
But perhaps most importantly, Barkley has thrown just one interception on 116 pass attempts.
Even while throwing for 892 yards and nine touchdowns through three games, the third-year signal caller has been quick to credit the team’s wide receivers for his play, particularly sophomore Robert Woods.
“He’s a special player,” Barkley said of Woods, whose 33 receptions lead the nation. “We’ve known that for a while. It’s great because we have athletes on our team that can make plays as well. If they want to overcompensate and cover him, then that’s just going to open up other guys.”
Similarly, the defense, based on its most recent performance appears as on track as well.
Through three games, USC is limiting its opponents to just 16 points and 317.3 yards per game, and in its last two games against Syracuse and Utah, it has held the Orange and Utes to under 100 yards on the ground.
It’s a near-100-yard per game drop-off after surrendering 400 yards per contest last season.
“We’ve really bought into this playbook and are really in it altogether,” Pullard said.
But for a young defense, leaving the friendly confines of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum might prove all the more challenging. Several of its defensive starters, including Pullard and freshman linebacker Dion Bailey, will play in their first road game for the Trojans. Game-time temperatures are also expected to approach triple-digits.
“It’s about composure, it’s about not letting that get your emotions up,” Kiffin said. “You can’t get into any of that stuff, whether it’s fans or players, whether it’s noise, no matter what it is. Over the years, this has been the best program in the world at doing it.”
After losing just twice on the road last season, Barkley, among others have downplayed the change of scenery.
“It’s going to be a hostile environment, no doubt, but that hasn’t has fazed us,” Barkley said. “I love it. I almost like away games more in being in that environment.”

What was once known as the USC College was dubbed “Dornsife” after Dana and David Dornsife donated $200 million in March.
Now, the school wants an identity to go with that name. To find one, it is using the Dornsife Commons, a venue for students and faculty to discuss the future goals of the school, as a vehicle for input.
A diverse group of students, faculty and staff convened at the University Club on Thursday to discuss the future of the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“Students who are in the College are studying many different sorts of disciplines, [so] we cannot be related to careers or career opportunities as the identification of the college,” said Charles Lanski, professor of mathematics. “There has to really be some kind of academic or intellectual identification that spans disciplines.”
Johannes Schmitt, a graduate student studying philosophy, raised the question of branding Dornsife College.
By and large, interdisciplinary studies surfaced as a way to develop the Dornsife identity. Jim Haw, professor of chemistry and director of the environmental studies program, talked about letting go of “the disciplinary game,” the traditional path to professional advancement.
“It is a revolutionary way of thinking about your career and your purpose and it does not occur without some people regarding you as turning your back on your career or your profession,” Haw said.
Muse Tan, a freshman majoring in psychology, came to discuss her hopes for modifying the college’s academic culture, which she sees marked by a domestic-international division as well.
“I think Dornsife should do more to let international students have more chances to voice our own values and beliefs,” Tan said. “At the same time it’s good for domestic students to get out of their own ideas, so they can get culture shock [like I experience] once in a while.”
Eve Lee, assistant professor of German, saw her department disbanded in 2008.  She said she came to find out about the future of German language study, which is in the Slavic Literatures and Languages Department.
Though the meeting did not ostensibly convene to address Dean Howard Gillman’s departure in May, the issue loomed in people’s minds.
Though Gillman’s announcement surprised many, its ultimate impact “depends on who they have to replace him,” Lee said. “We hope it’s someone who loves the humanities, who loves foreign languages.”
During the lunch, McCann called attention to the question featured in the Commons brochure’s event description, “What should the name ‘USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ mean?”
“Now I parse that as a philosopher; we know what the Dana and David Dornsife part means,” McCann said. “It’s the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences part we need to discuss.”
The discussion continues with a second Dornsife Commons lunch on Oct. 27.

At 1.6 percent, USC’s student loan default rate stands well below the national average of 8.8 percent, although defaulting on such loans is still a prevalent concern for many students at USC.
In the 2009 fiscal year, the cohort default rate, which measures the number of borrowers whose first loan repayments were due between Oct. 1, 2008, and Sept. 30, 2009, among student borrowers rose to 8.8 percent, from 7 percent in the previous year, according to a report released by U.S. Department of Education last week.
USC does what it can to ensure its students do not default on their loans, said Thomas McWhorter, executive director of USC Financial Aid.
“Students go through federally mandated entrance and exit counseling in addition to USC counseling,” McWhorter said. “And depending on the amount of debt they take on, they can even go through customized counseling.”
Rachel King, a senior majoring in psychology, said she was told the value of her education superseded debt.
“I’ve always been given the advice to take out what you need and pay back the minimum because education is the most important and you can pay back your loans later,” King said.
As defined by the Financial Aid Office, defaulting is the failure to repay a loan, as specified in the loan documents. For federal loans, the specified time period is nine months. If the borrower has not made a payment within this time frame, the lender will declare the loan in default and the remaining balance will be due immediately.
Of the 3.6 million borrowers who entered repayment during this time, more than 320,000 defaulted.
The percentage of students who defaulted on student loans at private institutions rose from 4 to 4.6 percent, while the percentage of students who defaulted on student loans at public institutions rose from 6 to 7.2 percent.
Students who are saddled with debt when they leave college face serious financial hurdles later on in life, said Rich Williams, higher education advocate for the California Public Interest Research Group.
“A large debt burden makes life tough for graduates,” Williams said. “Buying a home, starting a family or starting a small business may not be options for some student loan borrowers, even if they have a job. Those who default on their loans have a damaged credit history and could be discriminated against when applying for a job or even renting an apartment.”
Shrinking state budgets and stagnant grant aid have shifted much of college tuition costs to students and their families, leading to an increased reliance on student loans, Williams said.
Twelve years ago, the average college student graduated with $12,000 of debt. He or she now carries more than $23,000 of debt on average, Williams said.
Williams said defaulting on student loans is particularly bad because unlike unsecured debt, such as credit card bills, student loans are nearly impossible to discharge, the cancelling of a loan, even in bankruptcy. He added, however, there are options available to students that have defaulted on student loans.
“Once you’ve defaulted, effort is made by the school and government to get you back into paying your debt,” Williams said. “Students can investigate other options that are available to them. The government has increased the number of repayment programs.”
Borrowers who have defaulted can either consolidate the loans, allowing students to combine federal student loans to make for easier payments, or rehabilitate the loans, which allows students to reverse their default status.
Once the student has forgone default, many more payment plans are available. An income-based repayment program is one option that caps borrower’s required monthly payment at an amount deemed affordable based on a student’s income and family size. Through the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness program, the federal government forgives the loans of students who go on to work in the public sector for at least 10 years.
Vanessa Woghiren, a junior majoring in biological sciences, said defaulting on college loans is a serious concern for her.
“I receive a lot of financial aid but every year I almost have no choice but to take out the rest in loans,” Woghiren said. “I have to consider that I’ve been doing this every semester and I’m a junior now and a lot will have occurred by the time I graduate.”
Steve Moltzen, a senior majoring in business administration, is more focused on a job so that he can pay off his loans in the near future and avoid defaulting.
“I’m more concerned about finding a job,” Moltzen said. “If I don’t, defaulting becomes a serious possibility.”

With the largest turnout of hiring companies since the economic downturn in 2008, students focused on securing a job at Thursday’s career fair, rather than finding a job that pertains to their major.
Job search · The Career Center said more than 170 companies were represented at the fair Thursday, the most since the recession began. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
More than 170 companies looked for applicants with a variety of academic backgrounds.
Chanel Kaufman, a representative from U.S. Bank, said U.S. Bank was looking for applicants with strong leadership skills rather than specific academic qualifications.
“We are less concerned about a student’s major and more concerned with their leadership potential and previous experience in customer service and retail,” Kaufman said.
Carl Martellino, executive director of USC’s Career Planning and Placement Center agreed that a student’s major is only important in more specialized fields like medicine and engineering, but it is never too late to acquire specified technical skills.
“Technical jobs require a more specified track, including major and internships,” Martellino said. “If you get an undergraduate in philosophy, you can still go for a graduate degree in engineering.”
Martellino also said the size of the career fair is a sign that the job market for USC students and graduates is once again expanding.
“This big career fair is a terrific sign that things are looking up,” Martellino said.
The career fair included corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, Farmer’s Insurance and U.S. Bank, as well as non-profit organizations like Teach for America and the Japanese Exchange and Teaching program.
Some domestic students said their goal at the career fair was to find a job regardless of its pertinence to their major.
“I am looking for a paid job related to my major,” said Jensen Vollum, a senior majoring in economics. “But considering the job crunch, I will take what I can get for now. I am keeping my options open about what could eventually become my career.”
For international students, stakes were higher because finding a job is often a matter of maintaining a visa to remain in the United States.
“An internship or a paid position related to my major would give me a good chance to grow but would also secure my ability to stay in the [United States],” said Jeewon Yang, a Korean student majoring in public policy, management and planning. “Visas for international students expire a year after graduation and the only way to continue working here is to be sponsored by a company that you work for.”
Some international students find it difficult to get company sponsorship because the process requires a lot of time and money for companies.
“If they can get an American student with comparable skills and avoid the hassle of sponsoring us, most companies will do so,” Yang said.
Most of the companies at the career fair invited applications from all majors.
“A student majoring in one field is not more likely to be hired than another,” Martellino said. “Previous work experience, internships, classes with a specific emphasis and GPA all come into play when a company is considering an applicant.”

What makes a film critic different from Joe Shmoe writing a Rotten Tomatoes review? For L.A.-based film critic Emanuel Levy, it’s scholarship, prolific publishing and decades of experience. But those same traits also make him different from most film critics one finds in a regular newspaper.
Critic pick · Though L.A.-based critic Emmanuel Levy has some qualms with mainstream Hollywood production, one of his recent favorites include Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Levy received his Ph.D. in sociology of culture studies from Columbia University in 1978, where he also received mentorship from Andrew Sarris, one of the most influential film critics in American history.
“I’ve always had dual careers,” Levy said. “A full-time film professor and a full-time critic — which means I have no life.”
Levy balances teaching at Columbia and UCLA and writing books, including “Oscar Fever: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards” and “Vincente Minnelli: Hollywood’s Dark Dreamer.” As a critic, Levy wrote for one of America’s premier film magazines, Variety, for more than a decade, and became the head critic for Screen International. He writes for his own website, EmanuelLevy.com and continues to teach college students.
Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room. Like stereotyped lawyers, art critics have a reputation as snobs who value technical and artsy touches over fun and entertainment. Some have even gone as far as to call art critics the guys who hide out in the woods during the battle then run down the hill and shoot all the wounded soldiers.
Levy disagrees.
“Most stereotypes are inaccurate and deceptive — it’s like saying ‘Mexicans are lazy,’” Levy said. “You cannot generalize when there are 200 or 300 film critics in the country. None of my friends are snobs.”
Of course, some exceptions exist — Levy believes some critics are, in fact, snobs. The best way to pinpoint them is if he or she never uses the terms “picture,” “movie” or “flick” and steadfastly sticks to the hallowed moniker “film.” But if one wonders why critics trash so many movies, consider how many poor films a critic must review before chancing upon a great one.
“Most movies are bad by nature — it’s no different from music or literature,” Levy said. “It’s not a matter of snobbery. What comes out of mainstream Hollywood and independent, at least half is not good. As critics, it is our job to sort out what is good, what is distinguished and what is excellent.”
Levy sees his share of bad movies — he averages two films per day, one in theaters and one at home. For anyone curious about the perks, he rarely gets free popcorn, but he doesn’t find it hard to sit back and enjoy a fluffier film.
“I never turn my brain off,” Levy said. “But I can go in and out of the critical mode. To me, Basic Instinct is not a good movie but it has enjoyable parts. It’s a guilty pleasure; it’s like a trashy novel at the airport — you get to the end and you say, ‘That was trash but I enjoyed it.’”
There is a general consensus among critics for what makes a great movie. Levy uses Citizen Kane as an example of one such masterpiece. Almost by nature, masterpieces — like Shakespeare’s celebrated plays — ensure their own enshrinement in history. The exact parameters of less-obviously good movies, however, are more abstract.
“If I had a good definition I’d be the richest person in Hollywood — I would be able to tell people how to make only good movies,” Levy said. “[A good film] must be intelligent. A movie needs to have some overall coherence, unless the movie is fragmented by design.”
Levy believes Hollywood films like Transformers are fragmented messes because of poor direction, whereas French masters like Jean-Luc Godard use fragmentation for great cinema.
“For me, a good movie is where you get more than what you see,” Levy said. “It leaves lingering memories. Most Hollywood movies are junk, like fast food. How would you feel if you only went to McDonald’s for two weeks? Imagine if you see only junky, trashy movies for two weeks; it’s not good for your system.”
As far as Hollywood goes, Levy sees a few problems. One is the money-obsessed greed that often spawns 3D films out of material never intended for 3D. But the chief problem he sees is the discrepancy between the level of technology and good storytelling.
“The stories are formulaic and the characters are stereotypical and predictable,” Levy said. “It’s amazing what technology can do, yet we’re still telling this old-fashioned melodrama.”
Once again, there are exceptions. Levy believes directors like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese are especially cherished because of their ability to put technology to good use as a complement to a well-developed story.
Despite the problems he sees in Hollywood, Levy sees 2011 as a particularly good year. Some of his recent favorites are Drive with Ryan Gosling, Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris and the upcoming George Clooney film The Ides of March.
Though nothing is certain, Levy has high hopes for films that await the Oscar-contending month of December, and hints at a strong future for films, namely David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Steven Spielberg’s Warhorse and the animated The Adventures of Tintin.
“I may be in a minority,” Levy said. “But I think we are entering a golden age.”

Who would you want to play you in a movie? Well, if you’re Billy Beane and you answered “Brad Pitt,” your dream just came true.
In his latest film, Pitt plays Beane, a baseball-prospect-turned-baseball-flop who finds success as a scout and eventually as a young head of a big-name franchise.
Moneyball, adapted from a 2003 nonfiction best-selling book by Michael Lewis, depicts Beane’s career as a Major League Baseball general manager for the Oakland Athletics.
What makes his career special enough to be made into a movie? To put things in perspective, he assembled a winning lineup in 2001 with just $41 million.
The New York Yankees’ payroll was $138 million the same year.
The Beane-centric film is a unique glimpse into the business of running a ball club. Baseball fans — especially Oakland Athletics fans — should be pleased to see this front-office side of America’s pastime portrayed on the big screen.
Frustrated after losing in the playoffs and losing some of his best players to free agency, Beane faces career-defining choices during the offseason. The team owner refuses to increase payroll, preventing Beane from keeping key players. Grumpy sports agents force Beane to give up on coveted free agents, and the baseball scouts working for him refuse to accept any new ideas Beane proposes.
Pitt’s performance as Beane is laced with violent tendencies (he flips desks, throws chairs, breaks radios) and an understandably intense passion for baseball. Sporting a bit of a slimy hairstyle and always clad in Nike or Reebok clothing, Pitt gives off a sleazy, yet loveably smart-minded, vibe. He’s not too stoic here, as he was in “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”. While he takes his work seriously, it’s also clear he is a fun competitor.
And in a refreshingly dramatic role, Jonah Hill plays Peter Brand, the young numbers-obsessed baseball analyst who transforms Beane’s way of bolstering his baseball franchise.
Brand is based on Paul DePodesta, who served as Beane’s assistant general manager from 1999 to 2003. For personal reasons, DePodesta did not allow his name to be used in the film.
Regardless, Hill mixes it up with this role. He’s not trying to get a girl’s attention all the time or acting like a 20-something fool (see: Superbad and Funny People). Here, he portrays someone who knows how to analyze players based on numbers, has an economics degree from Yale and is eloquent enough to have Beane buy into his analytical, number-heavy theory on winning — dubbed “sabermetrics.” Sabermetrics analyzes baseball players based strictly on their statistics and performance — no “ego” or popularity is taken into account.
Though the performances are solid, adapting Beane’s various ventures, challenges and successes is too much for film. The first half of the film tediously builds up the sabermetrics approach and dramatizes the odds working against Beane’s new system. Veteran scouts and coaches hate the changes Beane enacts, and they want to make it known. But arguments bog the film down. It’s understood pretty clearly from an early point that the odds are working against Beane. Too bad the point is driven home a little too far.
Seeing a record-breaking win streak depicted is exciting, but it gets a little stale after 10 minutes. Twenty consecutive wins is nothing to be ashamed of, but it’s an aspect of the film that could have been more condensed. As ironic as it might seem, wins can get redundant, at least in film.
Respected writers Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Gangs of New York, Schindler’s List) and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network, The West Wing) penned the screenplay and Bennett Miller (Capote) directed.
Nicely constructed by Zaillian and Sorkin, the relationship onscreen between Beane and Brand keeps the film mostly fresh, as Beane adopts Brand as a mentee and confidante. Any lull in the film breaks when the two interact, whether Beane is calling Brand a “knucklehead” or ordering him to notify a player that he has been traded away from the team.
Though the film mostly just features Pitt and Hill, it has other noteworthy players. Chris Pratt (Parks and Recreation) also gives a strong performance as Scott Hatteberg, a catcher-turned-first-baseman who is given a second chance at success in the majors. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, meanwhile, is impressively unrecognizable as the portly and bald-headed team manager Art Howe.
As a whole, the movie features an abundance of actors and strong writing, but non-baseball fans might get bored. Statistics tend to bore, as does the film at certain points.

The word “mandate” sounds harsh and carries negative connotations; it denotes force and the disposal of independence. “Mandate,” therefore, is a word Americans detest — we never want anyone, let alone the government, to infringe upon our rights, and rightly so.
With that said, my ears perked up when I read that Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) had made efforts to mandate that all girls in sixth grade and up receive the HPV vaccine.
Edwin Rodriguez | Daily Trojan
 
Ideally, for the vaccine to be effective, the patient should not be sexually active at the time of injection — which is completed in three stages, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Unfortunately, Perry’s actions have received negative media attention, especially after Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said, “I’m a mom and I’m a mom of three children and to have innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order is just flat out wrong.”
When a mandate is approved for the greater good of a society — in this case the greater health of society — such an action is not wrong in any way.
HPV is a virus with about 100 strains. Thirty of these affect the genitals, and 13 are known to lead to cervical cancer. Currently, as many as 20 million Americans have some active form of HPV, according to the CDC.
Clearly then, this is an epidemic affecting the American population — most notably our youth. This is where things get controversial. On one hand, conservatives have argued that approving this mandate encourages youth to have sex.
On the other hand, proponents of Perry’s mandate find the requirement of the vaccine a positive step in integrating responsible health and sex choices.
Perry has brought an interesting opportunity to have more discussion between parents and children concerning safe sex and, god forbid, healthy lifestyle choices.
It’s unfathomable how this issue could be any more unnecessarily dramatic.
The positive effects of the vaccine so far have been overwhelming, with a recent study by the National Cancer Institute concluded that those who received the new HPV vaccine in an appropriate manner had a 90 percent chance of avoiding certain strains of cancer. And the procedure for the HPV vaccine is hardly reminiscent of a forced injection upon innocent little girls.
How is having a 90 percent chance of avoiding cancer a bad thing? As a female who has received the vaccine, I feel all methods of preventing cancer and certain STDs should be encouraged, especially if the vaccine is as reputable as Gardasil has proven to be.
We must not have a narrow-minded, pessimistic view of mandates. In some cases, such as this one, the potential benefits of that which is being required outweigh any negative connotations of the word “mandate.”

Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the HPV vaccine would only be effective for females before they became sexually active, according to the CDC. In fact, the CDC only recommends that females receive the vaccine before becoming sexually active, but does encourage receiving the vaccine after becoming sexually active. Read more here.
Great article  as a mother of a 10.and 12 year old girls  I agree that all girls should have this vaccine to prevent future health issues. mothers stop beeing narow minded  think about the harm and the pain that your girls would go through if they would to be diagnose with HPV. very good Article Mrs. Linton
Great article. As a mom I agree that all girls should be vaccinated to prevent a potential disease. If other vaccines are required why shouldn’t this one?
Hmm, it seems the English majors at USC have a better grasp on vaccine science and political policy than the Political Science majors.  Well written article, Ms. Linton.

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) pulled the pin on a political grenade that made many rethink their support for current GOP presidential frontrunner Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas). On Sept. 13, Bachmann exposed that in 2007 Perry mandated all sixth-grade girls in Texas receive Gardasil, the vaccine for human papillomavirus.
The mandate, however, made by executive order, was never actually implemented after extreme backlash. That someone who supposedly champions individual liberty and limited government attempted to impose such a personal order on young girls is disturbing.
During a time in which there is raging debate over Obamacare and an increasing perception of government-heavy handedness in healthcare, the HPV debacle doesn’t really come as a huge shock. Just because it isn’t shocking, however, doesn’t make its implications any less frightening for American democracy.
HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, is known to be a cause of cervical cancer in certain strains. Gardasil is doubtlessly a great medical advancement that all girls and young women should consider, but by no means should they be required to.
Unlike other pathogens, vaccinations can render ineffective, such as polio and measles, mumps and rubella, HPV is not a public health threat. It is not easily communicable and is mostly spread through sexual contact.
Assuming most 11-to-12-year-old girls aren’t sexually active, requiring all sixth-grade girls be vaccinated for a sexually transmitted virus is unnecessarily proactive, not to mention a major violation of parents’ rights to decide whether and when their children are injected with a manufactured substance.
The prospect of the government at any level forcing a needle into its citizens’ arms sounds wrong, but especially when these arms belong to innocent preteen girls without any choice in the matter. Their parents would have no say either.
The government’s job is not to make personal decisions for its citizens, especially when those decisions involve an individual’s sex life. When it comes to protection from a widespread public health threat that could affect the entire population, it’s a different story. Instead of leveling an executive order regarding the personal health of young girls, the most Perry should have done was encourage his state’s citizens to be inoculated, and not until they were actually of or near an age at which they would likely become sexually active.
The last thing we need is the government encroaching where it doesn’t belong and trampling on parents’ and patients’ rights.
 
Sarah Cueva is a sophomore majoring in political science. Her point runs Fridays. 
How can you as a woman and maybe ONE day be a mother of little girls even writte  this article HPV is a VACCINE to PREVENT  a dicease. CANCER to be exact.  what is wrong with your thinking.  this vaccine should be available and given to every female out there. please get you toughts straight.  ARTICLE no good
1) This is not an STD vaccine, this is a cancer vaccine that happens to suppress the responsible STD. HPV can be transmitted (albeit extremely rarely) via birth–reducing the risk of transmission helps everyone’s health, not just the receivers.
2) If this prevented strains of HPV from non-sexual contact, there would be a lot less controversy, such as strains transmitted via handshakes or close-quarters contact (e.g. public transport, dorms).
3) Many states mandate vaccinations for the safety of the public, especially things like meningitis or Hepatitis.  If you opt to have vaccinations made optional you increase the risk of mutations, which in turn can lead to worse epidemics or render previous versions of vaccines inefficient.  Preventive vaccinations are not a matter of reducing viral exposure, it’s matter of eradicating and neutralizing viruses on a massive scale.  Perry did this on a state level, which should make states-rights people happy.
This is not about constitutional rights, commerce, or sexuality, this is about ensuring that the entire American population remains healthy. The government is trusted to protect its citizens and this is just one of the steps.
So you would prefer that many women later die of cervical cancer?  The idea of vaccinating girls before they are sexually active (and frankly boys should be vaccinated too) is that you catch them before they are exposed to the disease in the first place.  Once exposed vaccinations help no one.  All vaccines work best when applied broadly.  This vaccine has been safely administered to millions of people. The reason that you as a young person grew up in a world free of polio, whooping cough, deaths from tetanus, many other diseases as well as drastically reduced death rates due to the flu is becauce vaccines were applied broadly to a cross spectrum of the population.  They only resevoirs of Polio left are in countries where – you guessed it – vaccination is optional. 
Vaccines save lives.  I think that preserving the lives of women young and old and preventing them from going through the threat of cervical cancer is worth it.  Michelle Bachmann’s science (as usual) is wrong, and though I’m no champion of either candidate Governor Perry’s approach is the right one to protect the population he’s responsible for.  I’m surprised that as a student educated at such an excellent college you would support her position in any way.  She also believes in creationism – is that part of your argument for her wisdom?
You completely missed the point of this article.  While some of the writer’s scientific facts may be questionable, her point is that the government should NOT have the authority to mandate STD vaccinations for everyone.  They are overstepping their boundaries in their never-ending quest to protect us from ourselves.  Someday there may be an HIV vaccine available.  Should the government mandate all children get vaccinated against that virus, too?  You and your liberal friends may think so, but there are plenty of people in this country who think otherwise.
I am not missing her point at all, Mr. “hide behind an anonymous name in your comment”.  The only way that vaccinations work well is if they are broadly applied to the general population.  The best way for that to happen is for governments to mandate participation at the most effective stage.  If you grew up in the US you’ve already had a number of mandatory vaccines – you can’t go to school without them.  One could argue that protecting the population from disease is perhaps one of government’s most important roles.  
Yes, in the case of an HIV vaccine the government should mandate it – just as they mandated polio vaccinations in the late 50’s and early 60’s and STILL MANDATE THEM TODAY.  HIV, HPV – these are all health and safety issues.  This isn’t a liberal issue, or a conservative issue – this is an issue of public health, vaccine science and plain old common sense.

USC’s campus is home to countless runners. Some choose to run on the track; others utilize the Lyon Center’s generous facilities; still others prefer to run outdoors around campus.
For years, USC has had a reputation for being a less-than-desirable surrounding area. Many runners chose not to run around campus or the surrounding neighborhoods.
But in recent years USC has done an admirable job improving off-campus safety, positioning numerous DPS officers and increasing the number of LAPD drive-bys in recent months.
That is not to say that runners should feel comfortable with running in the dark, be it early in the morning or late at night; this is not recommended in any area, regardless of the reputation. However, with proper preparation and knowledge, runners can go on a successful run of any distance around USC.
The most well known route is the 2.2-mile loop around the school, keeping close to USC’s fences. This run is well lit, visible, and flat — perfect for beginners. To add another mile onto the loop, travel down Vermont Avenue to Martin Luther King Boulevard. Make a right, and the loop back to campus will take you past all of Exposition Park, including the Coliseum, the California Science Center and the Rose Gardens. Beware of uneven pavement in the stretch of King Blvd., which is in need of repaving.
Runners might be discouraged from running into downtown due to traffic congestion and fear of crowds, but Figueroa Street is one of the safer areas to run near USC. An out-and-back trip to Olympic, for example, clocks in around four miles round trip; more experienced runners might consider running to Wilshire (five miles) or to the Disney Concert Hall on Grand Avenue and Second Street (eight miles).
As long as runners pay attention to streetlights and pedestrians (and run during daylight hours), a run through downtown can be an interesting way to explore part of LA. If Figueroa is too crowded for you, Flower Street — one block over — is normally less congested, with equally interesting shop fronts and architecture.
It is not recommended to run west of Vermont, or south of King Boulevard. In addition, runners should remember to bring a form of identification at all times, as well as a phone if possible. When running in heavily populated areas, such as downtown, headphones are not recommended, as they make it more difficult to hear traffic.
The area around USC has a stigma of being dangerous at all hours of the day, but in truth, it is safe for most of the daylight hours thanks to USC’s efforts to improve safety. Runners should feel free to take advantage of the paved routes around campus, but should still be aware at all times.
