TEDxTrousdale, a conference allowing students to present ideas on a variety of topics, will return to USC this year as a completely student-run, student-funded event.

The event, which will be held Thursday, April 25 in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom A, is the second TEDxTrousdale. The first was held in conjunction with TEDxUSC in 2010.
Unlike the event in 2010, however, this year’s TEDxTrousdale is completely student-run.
Undergraduates Alison Kaprielian, Kevin Koeller, Erin Limlingan, Jasmine McAllister, Sarah Payne and Catherine Uong came together in February to begin planning TEDxTrousdale despite news that the Stevens Center for Innovation would not be bringing TEDxUSC back.
“TEDxTrousdale is completely student-run [and] completely student-funded,” said McAllister, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience and economics/mathematics.
The organizers of the original TEDxTroudale selected seven speakers from 20 applicants representing various niches and topics throughout the university. Though this year’s pool of potential speakers was relatively small, Kaprielian said the organizers are already thinking about creating a more publicized, longer application process in years to come.
The 2010 TEDxUSC conference, which featured faculty and experts from a variety of fields, attracted 1,200 attendees in its first year. This year, however, the event will be more student-oriented and smaller in scale. The event, which will be held in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, will have 100 free seats available for members of the university community to come and listen to presentations.
“This year’s TEDxTrousdale is by the students, for the students,” said Uong, a junior majoring in business administration and East Asian languages and cultures.
Ian Murphy, director of communications at the Stevens Center, said that though members of the Stevens Center have given advice to this year’s TEDxTrousdale’s organizing committee, much of the effort is totally independent.
“[The students] haven’t needed a lot of help,” Murphy said. “They’re organizing it — they get all of the credit.”
Kaprielian, a senior majoring in international business and social entrepreneurship, said the name of the event represents the spirit of what the students are hoping to accomplish with TEDxTrousdale.
“Everyone walks down Trousdale once a day,” Kaprielian said. “We all pass Tommy Trojan once a day. Everyone comes together at Trousdale, and I think that’s a good representation of what we’re trying to accomplish with TED.”
TED’s motto, “ideas worth spreading,” also sums up what the organizers hope the event will inspire.
“Our goal with TEDxTrousdale is to leave our guests inspired,” McAllister said. “I want them to leave thinking ‘I have ideas too.’”

Electronic music has invaded the mainstream music charts and USC appears to have taken note.

The Thornton School of Music will offer a new course,  “Electronic Dance Music” (MUSC 499) in the fall. The course will present a comprehensive look at the history and development of the electronic music genre.
Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta said the new course reflects Thornton’s ability to respond to rapidly evolving music trends.
“We are constantly reevaluating our classes to keep up with the times,” Cutietta said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “I am very excited to be part of a music school that is so nimble and quick to adapt to the times and reinvent itself in response to changes in our art form.”
Cutietta said he hopes the course, which will be offered to all students including non-music majors, will attract students from other schools of the university to Thornton.
“We take very seriously our mission to provide relevant and meaningful musical experiences to the USC students who are not music majors,” Cutietta said.
In 2009, Thornton introduced the Popular Music degree program. After having success in that program, Thornton decided to introduce additional popular music classes.
“In concert with [the Popular Music program], we are trying to expand our offerings to [non-music majors] who are also interested in studying the cultural and historical aspects of popular music,” said Joanna Demers, the chair of Thornton’s musicology department.
Demers said the course will take a chronological approach in examining EDM.
“Each week we will present a different focus,” Demers said. “We’ll be starting off with the history of German electronic music, and then we’ll make our way into the ‘70s with groups like Kraftwerk, and then look at disco and other dance music genres.”
Along with reading assignments, students will be assigned frequent listening assignments. Reflecting the multifaceted nature of EDM, the course will also focus on the visual aspects of EDM.
“It’s a very easy time to teach this because so much of the material is available on YouTube,” Demers said. “I don’t think this sort of course would have been possible five years ago just because there wasn’t nearly the video documentation available then that we have today at our fingertips. It’s really going to be a very multimedia experience.”
Demers also said the course offering will be unique for a music school of Thornton’s stature.
“I think this type of course is revolutionary and original,” Demers said. “It takes some of the same questions that have been asked about hip-hop and rock ‘n’ roll music and are now being applied to electronic dance music.”
The course in electronic dance music will be taught by Sean Nye, who completed a dissertation on electronic music at the University of Minnesota and will be coming to USC after winning a highly competitive postdoctoral fellowship.
Ehren Elder, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, noted that although he is not a musician, he found the course appealing.
“I don’t think of myself as being particularly talented at music, but I would be willing to try these classes for the sake of a music education,” Elder said.
And Michael Nguyen, a freshman majoring in human biology, noted the class could be useful for better understanding the popular electronic music genre.
“This seems like a great opportunity for someone looking to explore the background of one of the most popular music trends today,” Nguyen said. “It looks very interesting.”
 
Before you go wasting my money (your parents) and your time on a course that will absolutely not benefit you in the future, lie down, think about how hard you want to be the next super star dj, and let that feeling pass. Elder and Nguyen, watch a freakin documentary about this stuff in your free time, or read a book on the topic. This is not a topic that requires classroom discussion and debate. Thornton is a cash cow for this school. What a waste of resources.
What makes the history of EDM less important than the history of any other genre of music? I’m taking the class not only because it fulfills a requirement for my minor, but also because I know I will be interested in the topic and it will be worthwhile for my entrance into the music industry later on. Watching “a freakin documentary” or reading a book will not give the same learning experience as being in a classroom environment with a knowledgable teacher.
you gotta be kidding me
lol @Angeles Rihner wtf
This would be a great opportunity to all music lovers. Thanks for this blog.
Thanks for your information on this blog. One particular thing I wish to say is that purchasing electronic products items on the Internet is nothing new. The truth is, in the past decade alone, the marketplace for online consumer electronics has grown a great deal. Today, you will find practically almost any electronic system and product on the Internet, which include cameras in addition to camcorders to computer parts and gaming consoles.
Thank you Angeles Rihner. That’s some great information. I had no idea that I could buy a camcorder on the Internet, let alone that the marketplace for such incredible technology had grown a great deal since 2003. If you have any more information on what we can do on the Internet, I know I speak for all of the DT’s readers when I say please, please keep us updated.
This class looks sick.

The School of Cinematic Arts announced this week that it will collaborate with the Beijing Film Academy to establish a joint program set to begin this June.
The China-U.S. International Master Classes and Industry Summits in Cinematic Arts aims to foster cultural and industrial exchanges between American and Chinese film industries, according to a statement made by Naga Film, one of the projects’ main backers.
Alan Baker, an associate dean of administration and international projects at the School of Cinematic Arts, said the collaboration promises to bring the two nations’ film industries together professionally and educationally.
“The objective is to really develop a much closer relationship with the Chinese film industry,” Baker said. “Not only with the professional part but with the educational aspect of the cinematic arts in China as well.”
School of Cinematic Arts Dean Elizabeth Daley will join Chinese filmmakers John Woo and Peter Pau at the Beijing Film Market  on Monday for a panel discussion about the collaboration.
According to a statement made by Naga Film, the company hopes this collaborative effort will “open doors for the global industry network to grow within China.”
Baker said the collaboration promises to provide a forum to exchange ideas across nations.
“I think there’s an enthusiasm about a greater exchange of ideas,” Baker said. “We have a lot of Chinese students enrolled in the film school, so it’s kind of a natural synergy or evolution of our relationship.”

Students, staff and alumni in support of El Centro Chicano stood in front of Tommy Trojan at noon on Thursday to protest the university’s decision to relocate the center to the Student Union.
“We belong here” · Edgar Aguilar, a senior majoring in theatre, protests the relocation of El Centro Thursday near Tommy Trojan. – Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
 
About 40 protestors with signs reading “We belong here” and “No taxation without representation” shouted “Si se puede” and “Fight on” at the protest. Student speakers said that they were speaking on behalf of the students who used El Centro and that the university’s impending decision to move El Centro did not take student voices into account.
The El Centro Ambassadors, a united group of students against the proposed relocation of El Centro, started a petition on April 3 that objected to the university’s decision to relocate the center from the United University Church, where it has been for 33 of its 40 years, to the Student Union, where other cultural centers student organizations currently are located.
Protesters voiced complaints detailed in the petition, a chief criticism being that the proposed space to move El Centro is half the space in the United University Church.
El Centro Director William N. Vela, who observed the protest from several yards away, said he estimates that between 200 and 400 students pass through El Centro each week.
“What we’ve started in the last eight years since I’ve been here is special,” Vela said. “We’ve been there for over 30 years. We do a lot of work with the community, and there are a lot of students who respect the history.”
The relocation of the center will also mean the elimination of free printing and computer services that El Centro currently offers to its students.
Edgar Aguilar, a senior majoring in theatre, said the resources that El Centro provides would be lost through the relocation.
“All of it will be gone,” Aguilar said. “There will be no place for students to study, no place for meetings and no place for students to just hang out.”
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Denzil Suite told the Daily Trojan that the university’s plan to move El Centro Chicano is aimed at better fostering the interaction between El Centro and other cultural organizations on campus.
Despite the argument that the move will consolidate all of the cultural organizations under one roof, many supporters of El Centro Chicano argue that the center is already heavily involved with the other cultural organizations on campus.
“We already work in collaboration with all of the other groups on campus,” said Consuelo Siguenza-Ortiz, an assistant professor of Spanish and a USC alumna. “Having this physical proximity will not work any better.”
Some protestors also feel that the relocation will remove what has become a second home to many Latino students.
“It has a special place in my heart,” Aguilar said of the center. “It’s a place that is able to unite us and they shouldn’t be able to take that away from us.”
Susana Pineda, a junior majoring in psychology, said the move will be a loss to many Latino students who have built emotional connections to El Centro.
“Moving El Centro is like moving homes for so many students,” Pineda told the Daily Trojan on April 13. “Although [it’s] just a location, it’s absurd to say that this place has not grown on so many students.”

Lemony Snicket rarely appears in public, but when he does, it is best to avoid him — or so he writes on his website. But his legions of fans, thankfully, have not taken his advice.

Though the story is marketed toward a young audience, The Dark promises to charm any reader, regardless of his or her age. But ask yourself, are you afraid of The Dark?

Last week, 42, the Jackie Robinson biopic, managed an excellent $27.5 million opening, which not only is the largest box-office opening for a baseball film but also the second-largest for any sports film ever. On the other hand, Scary Movie 5 failed to generate much interest with $14.1 million, far less than what the fourth one made its opening day in 2006.
Since there’s only one release this week, the Box Office Beat is going to look at the next two weekends. Coming out April 19 is Oblivion, a new sci-fi epic starring Tom Cruise and directed by Joseph Kosinski. The following week will see the release of Pain & Gain, director Michael Bay’s latest excuse to blow things up and the ensemble marriage comedy The Big Wedding.
Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as a handyman in a postapocalyptic future where the Earth has been ravaged by an alien invasion.  When he’s trapped on the surface, he ends up discovering the truth of what happened to the planet. Also starring Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman, the film is based on an original idea by Joseph Kosinski, who directed Tron: Legacy.
Though Tron may not have been a critical hit, it was notable for its visually striking imagery and this film seems to have that same heightened visual style. From the sleek unique designs of the ship to the serene yet disheveled landscape, this film demands to be seen in the IMAX format.
However, this is an original sci-fi property, which is a really hard sell. The marketing has definitely played up the visuals, but there doesn’t seem to be a significant enough hook regarding the storyline. There’s also the matter of Cruise himself; even though he’s one of the most recognizable stars on the planet, his recent films — other than Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol — have garnered mixed box office results lately.
Universal has played this up as a summer release in the middle of April, which very rarely sees this ambitious of a project.  We could see the film open around the higher $30 million, though a $40 million-plus opening is possible if the film is received well.
In the following week, we see the release of Pain & Gain, directed by action aficionado Michael Bay. The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson as a pair of bodybuilders who get caught up in a wild criminal escapade with tons of explosions, guns fired, bulging muscles and enough bromance to make your head spin. Bay hasn’t directed a straight-up crime-action caper like this since 2003’s Bad Boys II.
The marketing has played up the ridiculousness of the concept (which bizarrely enough is based on an true story) and the association with Bay, whose fame (infamy?) is based entirely on his ability to turn any car chase or shootout into an explosive assault on the senses.
Many people criticize Bay for his overemphasis on action, degradation of women and his racist/juvenile humor; however, all of that seems to be appropriate for this kind of movie rather than the Transformers films, where those traits were more jarring against the self-seriousness of those features.
The film is practically oozing with testosterone; it comes across as a Bad Boys II on steroids or even a parody of Michael Bay movies. To some people out there, that’s a huge selling point.
A number of issues crop up, though, since its R rating will limit its audience, and it may just be too far out of a plot for most people. Another problem is that it finds itself stuck between Oblivion the week before and Iron Man 3 the following week. Still, there’s a chance that it could benefit from its niche status and break out with a $40 million-plus opening. A likelier level is around the higher $20 million range.
Also coming out April 26 is The Big Wedding, which features a very impressive ensemble of actors and actresses including Amanda Seyfried, Robert de Niro, Katherine Heigl, Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Topher Grace, Ben Barnes and Diane Keaton. Directed by Justin Zackham, the writer of The Bucket List, it features a story about a long-divorced couple pretending to be married for the sake of their son’s wedding.
Despite the presence of four Oscar winners, this does come across as one of those generic romantic comedies that just doesn’t work with audiences the way it used to. It likely won’t open with higher box office numbers than The Five-Year Engagement, which opened last year around the same time with just $10.6 million, with a much greater marketing push behind it.
These next two weekends make for a nice pre-summer slate; although there’s nothing at the same level as Iron Man 3. But then again, what would be?

At the 2013 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, books are just the beginning. Hundreds of authors, celebrities, chefs and musicians will be at the festival, making it one of the largest and most esteemed public literary events in the country.
Beyond books · The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books has transcended its original goal of celebrating literature and is now a diverse cultural festival with music, cooking demonstrations, political and culturally relevant discussions. – Courtesy of Los Angeles Times Festival of Books
Not only will there be a variety of literary styles and genres at the festival, but also different forms of art geared toward a diverse audience, making this festival a force to reach out to the Los Angeles community and bring people together.
Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries and chair of the USC Festival of Books Academic Advisory Committee, said that it is easy to see how the festival has grown so much over the years.
“Although it’s called the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, it could or should be called the Los Angeles Times Festival of Creativity,” Quinlan said. “It has expanded beyond books to literature and creativity [and] integrates different narrative forms. The festival appeals to the community [as well as] students.”
Quinlan also noted that the annual event shines a spotlight on the university and its efforts.
“[This festival] transforms the campus and is a great addition to USC,” Quinlan said. “[It also] provides USC a chance to showcase talent, collaborate with Los Angeles Times and gives the community a chance to learn about [what] USC stages.”
More than 150,000 attendees are expected to attend the event and listen to figures as diverse as legendary comedian and actress Carol Burnett, chef Susan Feniger, Iron Chef Alex Guarnaschelli, beloved author Lemony Snicket and comedian Demetri Martin.
And in a way, the move two years ago from UCLA to the USC campus in the heart of the city has also made the festival more accessible to Angelenos.
For one, the Expo Line, which opened last year and runs adjacent to USC, will allow many people to take public transportation to the festival.
“For the first year, the Metro is running through the USC station, allowing even more Los Angeles residents to make it to the festival from further destinations without having to focus on parking and traffic,” said John Conroy, a member of the Los Angeles Times’ communications team. “We really hope that this added transportation allows even more Angelenos to enjoy all the entertaining activities throughout the two days of the festival.”
Aside from the small white tents that run along Trousdale, there are several larger stages to take note of. The Target Children’s Stage features kid-friendly readings and musicals acts, such as The SqueeGees, a playful kid-pop group. In front of Doheny Memorial Library, the Los Angeles Times Stage will welcome The Breakfast Club star Molly Ringwald and actress Debbie Reynolds. And if you’re getting hungry, the Cooking Stage, acting as a temporary kitchen throughout the weekend for chefs such as Ludo Lefebvre and the aforementioned Guarnaschelli, can be found on Cromwell Field, adjacent to a line of gourmet food trucks.
With increasing attendance since the festival’s first year at USC, there are more opportunities for the festival to incorporate multiple outside sponsors and exhibitors as well as represent artists and authors from the university.
Andrew Allport, a USC alumnus and winner of the 2011 New Issue Poetry Prize, said the commitment to diversity allows the festival to draw in an equally diverse slate of Angelenos.
“The festival offers a real spectrum — you have Margaret Atwood being interviewed by Michael Silverblatt and Brian Boitano selling cookbook sand everything in between,” Allport said. “I think it’s designed to appeal to all kinds of different readers, or perhaps all of the different reading tendencies in each of us.”
Allport will be at this year’s festival to talk about the connections between poetry and place and to read from his book the body | of space | in the shape of the human. He remarked that one of the most important elements of the festival is its ability to familiarize readers with the creative process behind their favorite texts.
“The festival is, I think, an opportunity for students to see and hear authors talking about their work and issues they care about,” Allport said. “Though students have to read lots of books and the whole educational process of the university is, in some sense, made possible by books, it’s easy to forget that authors actually exist.”
Since the festival’s transition to the USC campus, the festival continues to grow as a cultural celebration of multiple art forms. USC School of Cinematic Arts will host a special showing of new comedy Peeples, written and directed by Tina Gordon Chism and starring Kerry Washington and Craig Robinson.
And the festival will incorporate  multimedia in the form of the festival’s “What Are You Reading?” graffiti wall, which will give the festival a unique digital showcase.
Since March 25, fans have been uploading photos of their favorite books via Twitter or Instagram using the hashtag #WhatAreYouReading. The photos will be automatically pulled into galleries on the festival website and Facebook page and displayed on screens around the festival grounds.
But while the festival has expanded over the years, Conroy said the organizers have made it a point to try to stay true to the concept behind the first festival.
“The Los Angeles Times Festival of Books began back in 1996 with a simple goal: to bring together the people who create books with the people who love to read them,” Conroy said.
Still, it’s impressive that what started out as a simple event to celebrate literature and its authors has evolved into a nationally recognized melding of culture and community.
“The festival’s original aim was to celebrate the written word,” Conroy said. “Now, books really are just the beginning as the festival has become a true cultural festival with music, cooking demonstrations, engaging and entrepreneurial conversations about political and culturally relevant topics and so much more.”

“Seize the moment.”
That is USC men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith’s motto going into the team’s last regular-season match on Friday, in which the No. 4 Trojans (22-2, 5-0 Pac-12) will head to Westwood to take on the No. 3 UCLA Bruins (21-1, 6-0) with the Pac-12 regular-season title on the line.
The teams have faced each other twice this season, splitting the series with 4-3 wins. They first met in the semifinals of the ITA national team indoor championships in Seattle, Wash.
Though the Trojans dropped the doubles point, they fought back in singles play. They tied up the score, allowing sophomore Roberto Quiroz to clinch the match for USC in a dramatic third-set tiebreaker over UCLA’s junior Adrien Puget, handing the Bruins their first and only loss of the season.
Less than a week later, USC hosted UCLA in another tight match, but this time, the Trojans could not overcome their early deficit in doubles. With the score tied at 3-3, junior co-captain Emilio Gomez was left battling UCLA sophomore Marcos Giron, eventually falling in another third-set tiebreaker.
“I think when we beat them up in Seattle, we seized the moment,” Smith said. “And when they beat us here, they seized the moment. Who does it come down to? Does that person have the experience and confidence to come through? Maybe that’s a little bit of luck, but it’s how you start matches and how you finish matches. That comes down to just nerve and backbone and confidence.”
The Trojans will need to start strong in doubles to get an early leg up on the Bruins. Since losing the doubles point to UCLA in their second matchup, Smith has adjusted the doubles lineup to great success.
Junior co-captain Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann, who comprise USC’s top doubles team, have been particularly impressive. They are slotted as the No. 32 doubles pair in the country and are currently riding a four-match win streak.
“Yannick and I have been playing really well,” Sarmiento said. “I think our chemistry on the court is a lot better and we’re communicating a lot better, so we’re playing better.”
Sarmiento recently became the fifth Trojan this season to be named Pac-12 player of the week, while Hanfmann just captured his 17th consecutive win in singles play to stay undefeated on the season.
Hanfmann is also one of only two Trojans to emerge victorious in both of his battles against the Bruins this season. The other, sophomore Eric Johnson, said that the streak provides them a confidence boost going into the match.
“It’s definitely good knowing that we’ve won the last two times,” Johnson said. “But we both may end up playing somebody different than we played last time, so we don’t really know.”
If anything is certain, it’s that the match will be unpredictable. UCLA is coming off a close match against former No. 7 Pepperdine, which went down to the wire.
After conceding the doubles point, the Bruins escaped with a 4-3 victory over the Waves, a team that USC defeated 4-2 at Marks Stadium earlier this season. Though that may give fans reason to believe the Trojans can easily handle the Bruins, Smith is hesitant to jump to conclusions.
“You can make assumptions off that match, but half the time, those assumptions aren’t true,” Smith said. “You could say, ‘Wow, they’re not playing great,’ but they showed they could win a close match probably not playing their best.”
The match, which is set to begin at 3 p.m. at UCLA’s Los Angeles Tennis Center, will conclude the regular season and send the Trojans into the Pac-12 tournament in Ojai, Calif.
That being said, the team hopes to end the regular season on a high note and continue increasing their momentum heading into the postseason.
“If we lose the match to get there or we win the match to get there, the only thing that matters to me is that we take a step forward,” Smith said.

To call a loss “momentum-building” seems a bit counterintuitive. Losses generally quell momentum, rather than creating it.
Batting practice · Freshman infielder Blake Lacey (above) finished 2-for-5 in USC’s recent 5-2 win over the Loyola Marymount Lions. The Trojans had 15 combined hits en route to the road victory. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
 
But as the USC baseball team heads on the road for a three-game set against Utah, building momentum from a loss is exactly what it appears to be doing.
On Sunday, the Trojans (14-22, 6-9 Pac-12) fell 6-5 to No. 9 Arizona State. After trailing 5-0 at one point, the Trojans mounted a furious comeback over the last three innings but couldn’t quite push the tying run across.
Regardless, USC head coach Dan Hubbs was thrilled with the effort, which carried over into Tuesday’s 5-2 win over Loyola Marymount.
“We created a lot of chances for ourselves,” Hubbs said. “We just kept getting guys on base. But we left a ton out there. I felt like we should have scored 11 runs.”
Like USC, the Utes (15-17, 4-11) find themselves struggling in the rugged Pac-12 conference. Utah is talented, but youthful — three of its top five hitters are freshmen. Their Friday night ace, Mitch Watrous, is a sophomore.
The Trojans are youthful as well, but the more significant similarities are in the styles of play.
“They swing early, and they swing often,” Hubbs said of the Utes, who, similar to the Trojans, have more than twice as many strikeouts as walks. “They’re not swinging the back very well in terms of average, but they do find ways to score.”
Finding ways to score is something USC needs to do better. Despite having nearly 100 more hits on the year than Utah, the Trojans have scored just six more runs. USC banged out 15 hits on Tuesday but only scored five runs and stranded 13 runners on base. They struck out seven times and hit into a pair of double plays.
“It just comes down to being patient and not forcing it,” junior catcher Jake Hernandez said. “You gotta trust yourself to hit your pitch when it comes and not swing at the pitcher’s pitch, [when] the ball’s off the plate or [so] high that you can’t really hit well.”
Patience at the plate has been a problem for USC all year, and perhaps for no individual more so than Hernandez. The junior was expected to be a middle-of-the-order hitter for USC this year but has struggled at the plate, batting just .225 and striking out in nearly a quarter of his at-bats.
But on Tuesday, he went 2-for-5 with an RBI single and a solo home run, the first of his career. Like the rest of the team, he’s hoping to use Tuesday’s win to kick-start his bat.
“I’m just trying to keep a more consistent approach at the plate,” Hernandez said. “We’ve preached it all year that it’s your at-bat as the hitter.”
As a team, USC needs Hernandez and other upperclassman to get hot at the plate. Senior second baseman Adam Landecker has seen his average drop 22 points in the last five games to .328. Junior third baseman James Roberts’ average has dropped 34 points in the last six games to .324.
“We need these guys,” Hubbs said of his upperclassmen. “Especially the last week, when they’ve really been scuffling. We need to get them going. And they hit pretty well on Tuesday, so hopefully that will lead to them swinging the bat like they’ve been doing all year.”
Roberts, Landecker and Hernandez combined to go 5-for-13 on Tuesday, no doubt a step in the right direction. Friday’s game is at 5 p.m., with Saturday’s matinee at 11 a.m. and Sunday’s series finale also at 11 a.m.

I was browsing USCTrojans.com looking for column topics yesterday morning and saw the usual suspects: football, basketball, football and football.
But then I saw a headline that said “Trojan Tennis Takes on the World.” I was intrigued, mainly because I had forgotten all about USC tennis, specifically the men’s team. The Trojans have won four straight national championships. You’d think it’d be hard to forget about them, right?
Wrong.
Last season, USC featured Steve Johnson, who was the best player in school history and won two collegiate singles titles in addition to 72-straight match victories.
Johnson is no longer the big man on campus; he has graduated and is off to greener pastures. In his place stands Emilio Gomez. A lesser name for now, perhaps, but he is ranked No. 4 in the country in singles right now and has a great chance to win a national championship.
Despite the major turnover from last year (remember, the Trojans also lost Daniel Nguyen), USC is still ranked No. 4 in the country. They have a chance to win their fifth straight title. That’s amazing. And yet, no one is really listening.
It’s not the fault of anyone at USC — it’s just a fact that tennis isn’t a revenue sport and won’t ever be at the center of attention.
I hear someone arguing, “But everyone knows about USC water polo!” This is true. Water polo isn’t a revenue sport either. But it has a distinct advantage over tennis: It’s fun to watch.
With all due respect, collegiate tennis isn’t particularly riveting. Water polo, though, when done right, is incredibly entertaining. Last season’s national title match between USC and UCLA came down to the final minute. In comparison, I honestly can’t remember who the Trojans beat in the national title game to win the tennis title.
What men’s tennis head coach Peter Smith has done with the Trojans is incredible. The national champs from last year lost their two best players; can you imagine if the football team lost its two best players? Without Marqise Lee and Dion Bailey, for instance, a team that went 7-6 probably would have won four or five games. Keep in mind that the Trojans had 18 starters returning in 2012 and supposedly had its best players back. They still struggled.
Smith has managed to get the most out of his talent and, once again, has his team in contention.
USC will always be dominated by big-name sports. But it doesn’t mean we as sports fans should be oblivious to one of the greatest streaks in recent college sports history. USC’s men’s water polo team has won five straight national titles. Alabama football has won three out of the last four national titles. A long, long time ago, UCLA basketball won seven in a row. Other than those, there aren’t any runs in college sports that really come close to what the tennis squad has done.
So, the logical question is this: Where do we as fans go from here?
I’m not advocating we all watch every tennis match.
Other than being at the event itself, the only way to watch it is on the Pac-12 Network —and let’s be honest, no one gets that channel.
What we can do, however, is be supportive of the team and acknowledge what it has done over the last half-decade. And we can, in general, realize that USC has many other sports to offer other than those that make the most money.
In fact, its best sports hardly make any money. But that hasn’t stopped Smith and his squad from making the most of their opportunities. And from the looks of it, nothing will stop them from making more history, whether anyone is watching closely or not.
It’s time for us to do our duty and pay attention.

he was not (and it’s not even close) the best player in usc history.  do a little research, dude.  he may have had the most individual titles, but we are in a seriously watered-down era.  For example, Stan Smith was a former #1 player in the world.  Steve Johnson will struggle to attain top 25 status – especially with his backhand and lack of elite level movement.  USC is littered with former world champions – Steve Johnson will never be one of that class.  Nothing against him, it just is what it is.

The USC women’s water polo team may have suffered its first loss of the season on April 13, but the team will have an excellent opportunity to get back on the right track today at No. 4 UCLA.
Scoring needed · Freshman Anni Espar and USC’s water polo team are prepared for a shootout against UCLA after an 11-10 win on Feb. 24. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
An undefeated season is now out of the question, but a spotless record was never the goal for this squad; their ultimate goal, the NCAA championship, is still well within reach.
The Women of Troy face stiff competition in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, but a win tonight would earn them the No. 2 seed in the MPSF postseason tournament and help their case for reaching the NCAA tournament.
“If we win against UCLA, we are considered a lock for the NCAA tournament,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said.
Earning a bid to the NCAA tournament for women’s water polo is considerably tougher than being invited, for example, to the NCAA basketball tournament because only eight teams are selected from the nation’s six conferences. All six winners automatically earn bids, and only two at-large schools are invited.
The Women of Troy are not ruled out of winning the MPSF tournament, but a win against UCLA would help their case for selection should they fail to win the conference. USC, UCLA and Stanford are all top national programs, but only one can win the MPSF tournament, so the remaining two will be locked in a struggle to stay in contention for the at-large bids.
It’s easy to see that USC’s road to the national championship will not be easy, but a win in tonight’s contest would be a big step in the right direction. If the Women of Troy are to win, however, they will have to overcome some tough challenges presented by the Bruins.
“UCLA is a fast team,” Vavic said. “They do a good job of counterattacking, they are a deep and balanced team and they play a lot of players.”
Less than two months ago, the Women of Troy were exposed by this speed as the Bruins hung with them until the final seconds, when USC junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist put away a game-winning goal with just two seconds to play.
For a team that is used to winning games in blowout fashion, USC will have to be on its guard for all four periods. UCLA is not necessarily an offensive juggernaut, but they feature a couple of offensive threats in sophomore attacker Emily Donohoe (2.18 goals per game) and freshman attacker Rachel Fattal (1.93 goals per game) who can do damage to opposing defenses.
“We need to be aware and not fall asleep,” Vavic said. “They like to play a grab-and-go offense where they grab your suit and sprint past you. We also need to be aware on offense because any turnover will lead to a fast break.”
Turnovers were a major contributor to the loss to Stanford on Saturday, so look for the squad to make smarter passes in the pool against UCLA, especially when USC has a man advantage.
“We are working on our 6-on-5 this week,” Vavic said. “[Against Stanford], we had open people, but we weren’t aware they were open. And we made bad passes when they weren’t open, and those became turnovers.”
The game will begin at 5 p.m. at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center in Westwood.

The USC women’s tennis team took down rival UCLA on Thursday afternoon at Marks Stadium by a 6-1 margin, clinching the Pac-12 regular season title in the process.
Business as usual · Sophomore Sabrina Santamaria (above) helped USC defeat UCLA with a dominant 6-1, 6-0 victory over No. 3 ranked Robin Anderson. Santamaria also won her doubles match alongside Kaitlyn Christian. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (21-2, 10-0 MPSF) defeated the Bruins  (16-5, 7-3) in both of their matches this season and have beaten their Westwood counterparts in back-to-back matches for the first time since 2006.
USC also took sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 with the win and rounded out an undefeated regular-season conference record.
“It was a great win for us and beating [UCLA] twice in the same season is hard,” USC head coach Richard Gallien said. “It is a great accomplishment for the kids.”
The doubles point opened up the scoring for the Women of Troy with sophomore Sabrina Santamaria and junior Kaitlyn Christian leading the way against  senior Pamela Montez and sophomore Skylar Morton.
Meanwhile, sophomores Zoë Scandalis and Giuliana Olmos clinched the doubles point with an 8-2 victory over sophomore Robin Anderson and junior Courtney Dolehide, and the tandem of senior Danielle Lao and sophomore Gabriella DeSimone completed the USC sweep with a hard-fought 7-6 victory on court three.
The singles portion of the match featured two of the nation’s top players in USC sophomore Sabrina Santamaria, who ranks No. 2 in the nation, and Anderson, who ranks no. 3.
Mixing in a strong forehand with a variety of drop shots and lobs, and after dropping the first game of the match, Santamaria proceeded to take the next 12 games to handily defeat Anderson 6-1, 6-0. Santamaria looked to take the Bruins’ leading lady off her game early and kept Anderson on her heels throughout the afternoon.
“It felt great to get the win,” Santamaria said. “It’s always a fun match against [Anderson] and we know each other very well. It feels amazing [to win the Pac-12]. We have really good momentum going and we are excited for the NCAA tournament and the team championships there.”
Scandalis faced off against the Bruins’ Pamela Montez on court three and was able to make quick work of the UCLA senior with a 6-2, 6-1 win. Scandalis’ win helped put USC in the driver’s seat in the match as it went ahead 3-1 on the day with her victory.
DeSimone clinched the match for the Women of Troy on court five against fellow junior Courtney Dolehide with a 6-3, 6-4 win. Despite a strong effort from Dolehide in the second set, DeSimone proved to be too much and took home the win and the match for USC.
Olmos fell behind early on court four in her battle against Bruins’ freshman Catherine Harrison but was able to turn it around after a tough 7-5 tiebreaker gave her a 7-6 victory in the first set.
“I was getting a little nervous down 2-5 in the tiebreaker, but I knew that I needed to step it up and play my game,” Olmos said. “I had played [Harrison] before, and I knew I just needed to be tougher than her. I knew we had the title on the line and I didn’t want to lose because of the rivalry, but it didn’t make me nervous. Instead, it pushed me on.”
In the second set, Olmos was able to pull away from the freshman Harrison en route to a 7-6, 6-2 straight sets win.
“I really thought her [Olmos’] match is what turned it for us,” Gallien said.
Lao struggled mightily in singles against UCLA’s Kyle McPhillips, and she had difficulty finding a rhythm all afternoon. After forcing McPhillips into some early errors, Lao lead the first set 2-0, but she failed to capitalize on her early lead and dropped the set 6-2. After a back-and-forth second set, Lao couldn’t muster up enough to take control of the match as McPhillips took the second set and the match 6-2, 6-4.
Battling the stomach flu, Christian squared off against UCLA’s Kaitlin Ray on court six in a hotly contested match. Christian had trouble with Ray early on, dropping the first set 6-2 and falling behind 2-0 in the second set.
Resilient as they come, though, the junior fought back to win the set 6-3 and continued her strong play to take the third set 6-4.
“We’ll enjoy this [Pac-12 championship], but our goal is to be as healthy and fit as possible for the NCAA tournament and keep it going,” Gallien said.
With the regular season now over and a second straight Pac-12 championship to show for it, the Women of Troy are setting their sights on the postseason. Riding the momentum of an undefeated Pac-12 season and the play of a strong core of talented players, USC will look to make some noise in the NCAA tournament.

In response to Sragow video
Throughout the last few days, some people have mistakenly assumed that I want to censor professors’ freedom of speech. Not once have I ever advocated such a thing. In many cases it serves students well for professors to express their own opinions and political experience.
Nevertheless, the role of the professor should be to empower students with the knowledge to choose positions for themselves and to facilitate honest critical reasoning. I believe that an education should be earned from the bottom up, not from the top down.
The following points are at the core of this debate:
1. Professors have the right to express their own opinions in the classroom, but they should be held accountable for what they say.
2. Freedom of speech gives you the right to say unpopular things but hiding behind the banner of free speech does not entitle you to avoid being judged accordingly.
3. I did not prevent Professor Darry Sragow from exercising his freedom of speech by videotaping his lectures. All I did was put a new audience in front of what he said.
4. USC is an expensive school, and parents have a right to know what they are paying for and what their children are learning.
5. Donors have a right to know what they are funding.
6. Students should not have to choose between changing their ideology to earn a higher grade or speaking out during class and risk receiving a lower grade. (Many students are on loans, grants or scholarships that require them to maintain a certain GPA, so this choice is even more unfair to them.)
7. Sragow would have been reprimanded if he instead used derogatory remarks to vilify African-Americans, Latinos, women, gays or other minority groups. Same goes if he inferred that Muslims were sexist.
8. Since USC is a private school, it should have the final say in setting all its teaching standards.
It’s been said that Sragow is part of a program in the political science department where part-time professors of all views are brought in to teach about their own experience. However, I am not aware of any Republican professors that are as far to the right as Sragow is to the left.
Campus Reform, the group working on my behalf, contacted USC’s media relations about my video before we released it to the media. We gave them the video on April 4 and asked for a response within 24 hours. We did not get one. We contacted them several more times and never got a response. We released the video a week later.
I am not afraid of voicing my opinion. I am gifted and well-versed in politics, and I am more than capable of defending what I believe. I could have refuted Sragow’s statements during class. Unfortunately, I have been in classes before where I received weaker grades as a result of expressing opinions that contradict the professor’s.
I do not trust my grade in the hands of a professor who would instruct someone to tamper with my election information in the mail. Likewise, I would not trust a professor who says, “I encourage an open debate and active participation in my classes,” after using class time to berate those he disagrees with as stupid, racists and losers.
What happened in Sragow’s class last semester is not a rare outlier of what happens in many other classrooms across the country. The problem is that if I were to speak out against him it would not have solved anything in the long run.
At best, Sragow would likely have toned it down temporarily, only to return to his prior behavior next semester for other students to come.
I did not want to let that happen. There was a way to hold Sragow in check while at the same time sending a warning call to others of his ilk here at USC and at other universities. I felt that it was my responsibility to take this latter option, and I was prompted to videotape his lectures.
What I did required much more bravery than raising a debate in a small class. I instead took the debate to the national level, shining a light on a broader problem occurring in the United States’ educational system. Instead of changing one classroom, I changed many. But this venture has nothing to do with me. I didn’t do anything besides deliver a message. In doing so, I hope to have inspired future students who find themselves in the same situation.
I did not take Sragow’s statements out of context nor did I present anything but the truth. To attack my character is reprehensible and is a dishonest way of avoiding the content of this debate. If you are opposed to my message then tell me which of the above eight bullet points are wrong. Otherwise, the video speaks for itself.
Don’t shoot the messenger.
 
Tyler Talgo
Sophomore, political science 
It is actually quite funny that you would say “don’t shoot the messenger” because that is exactly what you are doing. Sagrow is simply point out the glaring issues that the GOP has with minorities and women. He did not make them that way. Irony is great.
Tyler, I look forward to voting for you someday.  I’m sure the Frankfurt School, in their wildest fantasies, couldn’t have imagined today’s world, where their program for the destruction of Western civilization is the accepted and ruthlessly enforced orthodoxy.  Interesting times, indeed.
People:  this is hate speech directed at white people and at white men in particular.   
So . . . let me hear you stand up for someone’s right to direct hate speech at white people but not at anyone else.
Step up, dingbats!
Thank you!
Objection to #7: “Sragow would have been reprimanded if he instead used derogatory remarks to vilify African-Americans, Latinos, women, gays or other minority groups. Same goes if he inferred that Muslims were sexist.”
The point in itself is valid (although the second sentence seems a little unnecessary and odd), but it doesn’t apply to this issue. Sragow was indeed attacking Republicans, but Republicans are members of a political party and NOT considered a minority group. Blacks, Latinos, women, and gays all have at least two things in common: that they are born with these identities which place them in a “minority group” (i.e. they cannot change this identity and had no choice in becoming a part of their respective group); and they are all currently, or at least were at one point, considered a “minority group” in the first place. Lumping members of the Republican party into this category does not make sense.
A more correct way to go about making the general gist that point #7 is trying to convey might be to say “Sragow likely would have been reprimanded if he instead used derogatory remarks to vilify Democrats or members of another political party, and Republicans should not be unfairly targeted.”
P.S. This comment is made with the assumption that all parties involved are intelligent enough to realize that gays do not willingly place themselves in a chosen minority group, as this issue has tediously been brought up historically.
Agreement to #5 – Donors have the right to know what their are funding.
We, the donors, are funding hate. Its that simple. This should not be tolerated.
To “hate on ” another group is so wrong! Disagreement with national policy, absolutely.
To teach hate, NEVER.
Wow this letter is depressingly arrogant and fails to even take seriously the various other points made about how he might have better addressed his complaint. Now every Professor has to live in fear that anything they say might be taken out of context and used to smear him or her on national TV. A Trojan horse trying to undermine our school does not make you a Trojan. USC had the privilege of being an intellectually and ideologically diverse campus: but you’ve thrown a hand grenade into that. Cost the school donors and opportunities because you wanted to play culture warrior for the week. A self-made man who worships his own creator…
The other side of the coin:

Do you honestly think you’re a prophet? You were not brave and you are not “gifted” in political science. You wanted to be on television and you got to go on Fox News to spe
to spew bullshit because they don’t have enough of that already. Get over yourself.
Going into a classroom with the hope that you might preserve your own “ideology” despite what you may learn from the course and its professor does not demonstrate a hope to be educated “from the bottom up.” 
Also, it’s important to note that your teacher *didn’t* say disparaging things about African Americans, women, or gay people. Actually, your professor highlighted an objective problem with the GOP, which is its history of racism and persistent neglect of minority rights in this country.  Your party openly supports voter suppression techniques that blatantly discriminate against Blacks and Latinos; Republicans also just blocked probably the most moderate gun legislation imaginable. You would be better off examining the ideology to which you subscribe and understanding that the GOP has major problems that will hinder its own future. Sragrow doesn’t make the rules, he’s just the messenger.
Actually “#6,”
The left has a far richer and far deeper history of racism in the United States. Please check your own history…take for example, the Dixiecrats/KKK…they were not Republicans but Democrats…and that is just one of many examples.
But do tell me, how does the present day GOP “neglect minority rights?” I’d love to hear that one.
And voter suppression? Is that like the black panthers at the voting booths? Oh no…that’s about supporting legislation that requires ID’s right? You know, like every other civilized country in the world? Furthermore, if ANYTHING, it’s not racist, it’s classist. You’re racist for assuming that only Blacks and Latinos will be “disproportionately harmed” by voter ID laws. 
And what does gun legislation (that by the way does NOTHING to prevent tragedies like Newtown) have to do with your baseless and moronic accusations of racism and discrimination?
Talk about someone who should examine their own ideology.
Firstly, your point about the left being more racist than the right it absolutely ludicrous. I believe that is was just earlier this year that Mississippi ratified the 13th amendment. (thats the one banning slavery fyi) Only 148 years late. Now who runs Mississippi? Oh yeah the conservative right. 
Now if you were trying to say that “democrats” have a longer history of racism than “republicans” you are only slightly more correct. Democrats now are not the same thing as democrats in the 1950s or democrats in 1900. The parties have shifted, changed, and realigned so many times you cannot trace one party all the way back to the forefathers. So, yes, you could say that members of the “democratic” party in the 1860s that were members of the KKK are more racist then the “republicans” of the time, but that means absolutely nothing about the current party system. 
How do the GOP neglect minority rights you ask? Well lets look at voter ID laws. Now there is nothing wrong with requiring IDs, but doing so in a manner in which there is not enough time for everyone to get an ID before poll day, is a problem. It takes at least a month or even longer to get a correct ID in certain places and a lot of the voter ID laws passed by the GOP were passed within one month of the election. The next part is it is fairly costly to get an ID. I believe I paid 50 or 60 bucks the last time i renewed my license. For someone who is unemployed or barely making ends meet with a minimum wage job, 50 bucks is the difference between food for a week and no food for a week. So with the monetary obstacles we essentially return the the land ownership requirement from 100 years ago. We already had this debate a long time ago. Every U.S. citizen has the right to vote with out an monetary or other obstacles. That would be one way that minorities are disadvantaged. 
It is actually quite hilarious that you would call #6 racist for “assuming” only “black and latinos” are disadvantaged by voter ID laws and the GOP. I just pointed out that anyone with money issues would be disadvantaged. But if you’re not happy with just evidence towards “black and latinos” being disadvantaged, I’m sure I could tell you about women’s rights to equal pay (Lilly Ledbetter act which the GOP tried to downvote) or a whole host of anti-women’s health laws passed by GOP states. Lets check the list of people disadvantaged by the GOP: “blacks and latinos,” (check) women, (check) poor people. (check) Who does that leave? Rich white men. 
I think that about does it. Please do let me know if you ever need a fact-checker for a paper you’re doing. You could really use it.
I heard you got an ‘A’ in the course… so much for #6…  
The university does protect students against arbitrary academic evaluation, but not from encountering opinions and viewpoints that are counter to or even offensive to their own.  The appropriate action would have been to complain to the adjunct’s boss — that is the Chair of the Political Sciences department and then the Dean of the department’s college.  If you hadn’t addressed it there first, then there was no justification for going straight to the president of the university.  This way just smacks of ego… demanding attention without going through any due diligence and thinking you can just circumvent all established processes to jump to the front of the line is no way to operate and leaves you with nothing of substance to support your actions.
haven’t heard any points like this before. glad to know you guys are starting to get creative. but the question of whether he ‘jumped in front of line’ seems rather irrelevant.
try reading the article first next time?
The saddest revelation to come out about USC in the past week is not that a USC Adjunct said hateful things about Republicans. Its that someone like you attends this University.
25.
 That’s the number of times you used the word “I” in your Letter; a fact that demonstrates what most of us were already thinking; that this entire charade has been about you and your need for attention. Your 15 minutes are almost up Tyler. I sincerely hope that the next time we hear from you it is on a much more substantive issue with a lot less self-aggrandizement.
Although I do wish that Tyler had challenged the professor, several of his points are valid – and I defy anyone to counter point #7 in particular.
ALEX YEBRI
As a young conservative myself, i can confidently say that you are a poor excuse for a republican. Whoever is encouraging you is destroying what it means to be a young republican. You couldn’t take on sragow even if you had the best conservative debate strategist in the country, you would simply screw it up somehow, you looked like a clown on fox news big guy, if you are the future of the republican party, then i fear for the future of our great nation.
The other side will call you names for the way you approached the situation, but wont condemn what Prof. Sragow said. That is the issue at hand. They love the bias at the university and will use you as the scapegoat to support Sragow’s bigotry. Don’t let it get to you Tyler.
“I am gifted and well-versed in politics, and I am more than capable of defending what I believe. I could have refuted Sragow’s statements during class. Unfortunately, I have been in classes before where I received weaker grades as a result of expressing opinions that contradict the professor’s.”
Wow arrogant much? If you’re so well-versed in politics, you ought to know that secretly recording a professor and “demanding a response” within 24 hours is incredibly childish and immature.This is not the way to foster a discussion. And don’t for a second pretend that this is about “free speech.” 
Furthermore, you have done all Conservatives a disservice by being a whiney coward, claiming that professors like Sragow would grade you unfairly. This is not a community college, it’s USC. You’ve only been here in this program at the time this was recorded less than one semester! You have no idea what the grading system is like! Don’t make all of USC and all Conservatives look whiney and cowardly like you. Your video would have been much more effective had you recorded yourself arguing with him…since you’re so “well-versed” and all.
 Grow up.
Emily.
This comment is so off message. If Alexis is a Conservative at USC, she does not identify nor speak for any of us. What Tyler did was right on. 
And his video would be more effective that way? Seems to be pretty effective as is. Go home you delusional RINO.
Great points!
Right on point. Great job Tyler!
Bravo!
You are one brave young adult. Your parents should be proud:)

The Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday its decision to ban generic versions of the original OxyContin formula, a narcotic medication often widely used to treat and alleviate chronic pain.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
 
According to CNN, the agency has decided upon this change “in an effort to curb prescription painkiller abuse.” Since it was first approved in 1995, OxyContin has been extremely attractive to drug abusers, who either swallow the pills normally, crush them to snort, or crush and melt them to inject.
Yet, on closer examination, it appears the ban will do more to inflate OxyContin prices and lead to more profits than to stop abuse. The ban will also make it more difficult for people who need OxyContin for legitimate medical reasons.
It is true that prescription painkillers kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined, with approximately 12 million Americans over the age of 12 reportedly using prescription painkillers recreationally in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But it is unclear how much reducing the availability of cheaper generic forms of OxyContin will do to curb the abuse of the drug. And it appears that in its effort to curtail abuse, the FDA is actually also harming those who need the drug for medical illnesses but cannot afford the brand-name version.
The average cost for a pill of brand-name OxyContin is now $7.50 — $450 per bottle of 100, according to NPR. So the ban is obviously good news for Purdue Pharma, the producer of OxyContin, as the drug accounts for one-third of its company’s revenues for prescription painkillers. That amounts to $2.8 billion in sales, according to online health resource IMS Health, and the company could be looking at even higher profits once the competition from generic producers of OxyContin dies down.
And while profits will skyrocket, so will the troubles of everyday people who cannot afford the increase in cost. Even worse, the high cost could drive doctors to switch prescriptions to methadone and other, less convenient options when a patient’s insurance won’t cover OxyContin, according to NPR.
Essentially, this means that in its attempt to curb abuse of the drug — an issue with the nature of the medication itself — the FDA has put patients’ health and treatment on the line. With OxyContin only available at higher prices, more patients will have to settle for less effective and less convenient treatment options to provide pain relief.
Meanwhile, it’s also unclear how effective other measures to stop OxyContin abuse have been.
In August 2010, Purdue stopped selling the original formula to pharmacies and reformulated the pills to become more crush-resistant, and thus more difficult to abuse for a quick, heroin-like high, according to CNN.
Yet in an NPR article, Andrew Kolodny, head of psychiatry at Maimonides Medical Center in New York, noted that “a pill that’s harder to snort or inject isn’t necessarily less addictive.”
And similarly, it could just be that a pill that’s more expensive won’t deter addicts from continuing to buy it.
The real problem lies with the very nature of how addictive the drug is — an issue that has no real solution besides completely banning the drug itself.
The new policy merely will benefit Purdue, despite the company’s past missteps: Purdue pled guilty in 1997 to federal charges that it had misled consumers by branding the drug as safer and less addictive than short-acting narcotic drugs, according to NPR. This is clearly not a company that’s hellbent on putting patients first.
It appears rather than improving others’ quality of life or helping save souls, this new ban boils down to money.
 
Valerie Yu is a freshman majoring in biological sciences and English. Her column “Heart of the Matter” runs Fridays.
Very disappointed concerning FDAs’ decision.  Went to pick up my meds today, shocked at the cost.  After being on Oxycontin for 10 years, I find myself in the donut hole, and tier exception or not, my cost is about 400 dollars.  I exist on a limited income, qualify for no assistance, this is incredibly wrong.  Love to see the list of high investors, just saying………..
Why doesn’t  the FDA watch all the YouTube videos out showing how people have figured out to bypass Purdue Parmas abuse proof pills. I have been prescribed oxycontin for over 10 years and my insurance is changing next month and wish their was a generic available because I will not be able to afford the price of the name brand. Purdue Pharma doesn’t give a shit about helping people it is all about them making billions of dollars!!
Canada has recently approved the generic version of the original Oxycontin OC. EVERYDAY, legitimate pain patients cross the border & have their prescription filled to save hundreds of dollars for a more effective Oxycontin. (Oxycodone Extended Release)

Alex Arevalo could have decided to pull the brakes. He could have decided his absence during the fall was the end. 
“The benefit of being a fall admit is that everyone is new and anyone can meet anyone,” said Arevalo. “Spring admits have to find a way to meet people because the time for meeting everyone has passed.”
As a spring admit Alex Arevalo was concerned about finding his niche in USC’s social scene, but he made himself a way by getting involved. — Courtesy of Alex Arevalo
Arevalo, a freshman majoring in business administration, arrived at USC in January feeling the disadvantages of spring admission; besides class availability, spring admits like him needed to make the social transition.
Instead of sulking, Arevalo decided to participate in rush week. Over the course of mixers and meetings, Arevalo found his brothers — people who he felt ready to share his college experience with.
As he enthusiastically notes, the decision to pledge a fraternity arose from a desire “to integrate into the phenomenal social network that USC has to offer.”
“But it wasn’t just for the social scene. I have developed some of my closest friendships with guys in my fraternity,” said Arevalo.
Apart from the abundance of philanthropic and social events Phi Psi brothers attend, Arevalo admits to the other perks of Greek life.
“My fraternity has been a guiding example for me in the classroom. A lot of the guys were in the same situation I am today so they really are helpful with tips and ideas on how to manage your schedule and workload,” he comments. “They are also really supportive of checking over essays, homework, and studying as groups.”
But Arevalo is more than just a charming smile and an excellent spokesman for the Greek community. He’s a testament to how any situation can be turned around with the right attitude.
Instead of spending the fall semester disappointed that he would miss out on the hurrah of campus life, Arevalo decided to get behind the wheel of his car and challenge himself to a road trip from Los Angeles to Chicago.
But his pit stops weren’t just any dingy gas stations serving questionable hot dogs and expired candy. He saw everything from the Grand Canyon to the Colorado National Park along his route.
“I was trying to expand my tangible experiences because that’s where true knowledge is learned,” he said.
Arevalo’s road trip is certainly over. But his journey isn’t done just yet. No matter the stop signs, speed bumps and frustrating roundabouts, this Trojan’s positivity is paving a new path for spring admits to get adjusted.
Hmm… if this is an article about Alex being a greek god, why is there no tribute to his abs? It’s basically a slap in the face to the hard work he puts in everyday :/
Yeah, being Alex’s roommate it was clear that he was having a tough time transitioning every time he brought a girl back to his dorm.
I have seen this fellow in the greek community, besides being the biggest pot head/drinker, hes a good guy.
Sam, I am deeply disappointed to hear what you think about Mr. Arevalo. From my experience Alex is one of the most level-headed, kind, and outgoing individuals I have ever met. Perhaps you should base your future judgments on a little more than just “see[ing] this fellow in the greek community.”

April is when baseball players and teams stumble to find their footing, but it is also an opportunity to get away with early mistakes. So there’s time to remedy all the wrongs that have been committed—of which there are many. The theme of this young season: Down goes Goliath.
In recent years, glory in the MLB has transitioned away from slugging greats and toward pitching phenoms. Especially in the last three years, a commanding rotation and bullpen have been crucial tools necessary to punch a postseason ballot.
This offseason, teams held tightly to their aces or made significant attempts to procure more a la the Los Angeles Dodgers. But when are these Cy Young contenders going to step up to the mound? So far, we haven’t seen very many noteworthy performances, barring Yu Darvish pitching 8.2 innings of perfect baseball for the Texas Rangers.
Here are some pitchers that are giving us pause:
Matt Cain (7.15 ERA), San Francisco Giants: The veteran righty led an impressive round of pitchers through the postseason and suppressed opposing hitters to let the Giants’ anemic offense triumph. Cain blasted through the Cardinals in the 2012 NLCS, but was blasted by the Cards in their first meeting this year. Cain gave up nine runs in a monstrous fourth inning in that game, and surrendered seven runs to the Brewers on Thursday.
Cole Hamels (7.56 ERA), Philadelphia Phillies: The pretty face of the Phillies had some ugly initial outings, giving up five and eight runs in his first two starts. He seems to be settling on his pitches, and when their touted starters can’t get the job done, then the Phillies and the N.L. East’s reputation suffers.
David Price (5.82 ERA), Tampa Bay Rays: The reigning AL Cy Young has been showing some inconsistency, which is natural this early, but eight runs allowed against the Cleveland Indians doesn’t bode well for a pitcher with bona fide accolades.
R.A. Dickey (5.82 ERA), Toronto Blue Jays: Some thought Dickey got slighted when he wasn’t selected to start last year’s All-Star game, but his NL Cy Young award more than compensated for that. After departing the Mets, the new blue hasn’t fit well. Dickey gave up three runs on four walks and five hits to the Indians in his debut, and was rattled for seven earned runs by the Red Sox in his second time out.
As for the Dodgers, this one is on the horizon after they lost Zack Greinke to a broken collarbone after an infamous brawl. Los Angeles entered the season a surplus of pitching, but for now San Diego is having the last laugh. The Padres swept the Dodgers in enemy territory, scoring 22 runs in three games while launching three home runs off Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw.
Baseball is a 162-game marathon and these pitchers should rebound. But for now, it seems that MLB bats are getting as hot as the weather.

In a unique collaboration with Neon Tommy and USC Annenberg School of Journalism and Communication, the Daily Trojan presents Getting Sensual, a special online supplement focused on intriguing artists in Los Angeles whose approaches to the five senses leads to compelling results.
The package was developed in Arts Reporting (Jour 447), an Annenberg led by acclaimed journalist and arts expert Sasha Anawalt, as part of an interview assignment in which students profiled artists in the city. Taste, smell, touch, sight and sound are all represented, with a sixth piece acting as a thematic overview of the five-senses experience.
In Into the Fire: A Taste of Chef Michael Cimarusti, Daily Trojan editor Eddie Kim looks at how Michael Cimarusti, chef and co-owner of acclaimed restaurant Providence, is pursuing the highest standards of dining and how he hopes to continue the success with a new venture, Connie & Ted‘s.
In The Nose Knows, Cal Tabuena-Frolli examines Julia Kouneski, a local performance artist who is pushing the boundaries of public intimacy by tapping into the the sense of smell in challenging new ways.
Dance Dance Revolution: USC’s Sokamba Dance Company, a print and video collaboration between videographer Jenny Sun and writer Laurel Galanter, follows USC student Rissi Zimmerman as she leads Sokamba with cutting-edge choreography and a sense of artistic freedom.
Eyeing the Connection, by Andrea Alonso, tells the story of local artist Mary Sherwood, who finds inspiration in biology — in particular, the eyes. Sherwood’s personal story particularly informs her artistic process, and the end results are both fascinating and intricate.
In The Sound and the Fury, Funmi Akinyode sits down with musician Lara Meghan Anderson, whose struggles in the music industry has inspired new developments as well as an explosive EP that melds pop, rock and grunge.
And in Los Angeles: A Jungle of Senses, Bryce Rankin gives a first-person account of traveling through Los Angeles by foot and public transportation, exploring — and celebrating — the city’s kaleidoscope of senses.
The package was designed by Cal Tabuena-Frolli and was translated for web by Annenberg web graphic designer Patricia Lapadula. We hope you enjoy this special look into Los Angeles’ artistic offerings, and please feel free to leave feedback in the comments below.
