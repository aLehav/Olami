The USC Middle East Studies Program held a panel to discuss the political situation in Turkey, which experienced an attempted coup in July, Monday in the Von KleinSmid Center. Assistant Professor Mehmet Sinan Birdal of Isik University’s department of international relations and Assistant Professor Veli Yashin of USC Dornsife’s department of comparative literature led the discussion, which included an audience consisting of students, faculty and alumni. 
While both professors connected their thoughts to the topic of the coup, which was carried out by a faction within the Turkish military, both provided different angles on Turkish politics. Yashin read his latest paper on political trends in Turkey as an introduction, while Birdal used photographs to illustrate the methods that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is using to consolidate his power. 
“The biggest question, I think, right now, is who represents the people — the parliament or the president,” Birdal said. “More specific is the question of whether the office of the presidency is an executive office or a symbolic office. Even though Erdogan has a hold of the masses, that does not mean that he is the masses.
Birdal gave a bit of background on Erdogan’s role in power and how it affected Turkey’s current state. According to Birdal, Erdogan’s rise to power was a compromise between two evils — the alternative of which was complete warfare between the two conflicting groups of elites.
“If the rivalry between two groups of elites is so fierce that without a strong hand things would get out of hand … then you need a single person to rule over the factions,” Birdal said. “And Erdogan was this person who took this position.” 
Yashin spoke about the complexities involved when different factions within Turkey compete for their individual interests. The most well-known of these is the ongoing conflict in Southeastern Turkey between the government and Kurdish rebels, who aim to establish an independent nation. 
 “One thing you have to understand is that the western media frames everything happening in Turkey as a conflict between secularists and Islamists,” Yashin said. “But when one contemplates the Turkish coup, much of the coup roots itself in what’s happening in the Kurdish region, and there are also other external factors, but the western media doesn’t really cover that.”
Yashin said that although the coup attempt in July was meant to topple Erdogan, it actually served as a tool for him to gain more power because it provided him with an excuse to strengthen his hold on the country. Since the event, Erdogan has carried out “purges” of government officials, university professors and others that he sees as potentially dangerous to his regime, claiming that these people were involved in the attempted coup.
“The idea that the specific actors of the coup attempt are being punished is a fiction,” Yashin said. “This coup attempt was a ‘gift of God,’ as Erdogan put it. It was only used to intensify what was an ongoing process of Erdogan trying to unite Turkey against the Kurds.”
Both Birdal and Yashin agreed that Turkey’s current situation is in a crisis. The military had previously toppled Turkey’s government in 1960, 1971, 1980 and 1997, but Birdal said that Erdogan’s determination to jail and detain those he claims are responsible for the most recent attempt are undemocratic.
“Half of the Turkish government graduated from the Ankara University, where I studied political science,” Birdal said. “So they know everything that I know. That’s why I’m not sure why the state of the government is like this because they all know it will fail in the end.” 
Yashin pointed out that there is no clear solution, but that the steps the Turkish government has taken in response to the coup attempt have been counterproductive. 
“In many ways, Turkey is facing a constitutional, foundational crisis,” Yashin said. “We don’t know yet if it is going to survive this process, or if a new Turkey is going to emerge. The government needs to somehow redefine itself, but what has happened so far does not look promising.” 
Prior to the infamous Arab Spring the Muslim world was run by strong-armed dictators, Islamic theocrats, and corrupt royal families with armies of secret police.
Now, after the infamous Arab Spring and the coup in Turkey the Muslim world is now run by strong-armed dictators, Islamic theocrats, and royal families with armies of secret police.
Maybe it is time these supposed “experts” on Islamic governance should focus on Islam’s core tenets and how they naturally lead to leaders who are strong-armed dictators, Islamic theocrats or corrupt royal families.
There was no, “Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…” in Islam there was only ruel by the sword.  Shocking, isn’t it, that rule by the sword is what the Islamic world’s got?

A poll conducted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in partnership with the Los Angeles Times is applying a new approach to tracking political opinions. The USC/Los Angeles Times “Daybreak” Poll implements a rating scale to ask a panel of approximately 3,000 participants questions about their outlooks on the presidential race.
The poll, which launched in July 2016 and will run through the November election, is part of the Understanding America Survey managed by the Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research. The UAS is a panel at USC comprised of 5,500 individuals representing the United States. The study is an ‘Internet’ panel, meaning that participants use computers, smartphones and tablets to engage in the survey. Respondents answer questions about a variety of topics, including their household demographics, health, retirement plans and thoughts on the election. 
The UAS election panel consists of around 3,000 randomly recruited participants from the wider panel who have agreed to answer questions about the election. Each day, around 400 individuals out of those 3,000 are asked to state the likelihood that they will vote in the election, the candidate that they will likely vote for and the chance they think each candidate has of winning. The results of the poll are weighted to take into account demographic characteristics, such as race, gender and income, from the U.S. Census Current Population, and adjusted to the 2012 presidential election outcome based on how participants voted back then. The results are regularly updated online, along with averages of all the prior week’s responses. 
The Daybreak Poll exhibits a distinguishing characteristic from most polls, which will ask people which candidate they prefer and exclude people who are undecided from any analysis of candidate support. The Daybreak Poll, however, asks participants to rate, using a 0-100 scale, their chances of voting for Clinton, Trump or another candidate. Because of this, every participant will influence the results, which provides insight into how uncertain voters are currently feeling. 
Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur said that this method allows for better monitoring of how voters’ opinions are changing. 
“Our poll isn’t simply measuring the preference for candidates, but rather the intensity of voter support,” Schnur said. “It’s become increasingly clear over the past few months that while Clinton enjoys support from a larger number of voters in this election, Trump supporters are much more fervent in their support of his candidacy.” 
Some have expressed concerns that the Daybreak Poll shows a Republican bias in terms of candidate support, because of how it factors in the way people voted in the 2012 election. The poll weighs the sample of participants so that 25 percent of the sample are people who claimed to have voted for 2012 Republican party nominee Mitt Romney and 27 percent for President Barack Obama. But problems can occur with self-reported past voting when people aren’t honest about how they voted. Some polls have revealed that the percentage of people who — after an election — say that they voted for the winner exceeds the winner’s actual vote. This weighting could potentially cause too many Republican voters to be included the sample, giving Donald Trump a boost in support. 
Jill Darling, the survey director of the UAS, said that all pollsters vary in terms of how they choose to collect and model their data. She doesn’t think that there is a definitively accurate technique to poll voters. 
“One study found that people who had not voted for an incumbent were less likely to participate in a subsequent study about election results,” Darling said. “We can’t know if people are under-reporting votes for a non-incumbent, or whether the sample itself may just not have enough of those people [who didn’t vote for an incumbent] in it.”
Some USC students believe that while the poll is useful, it does have certain drawbacks. Ali Main, a junior studying broadcast journalism, said that although she consults the poll frequently, she doesn’t think it’s necessarily indicative of the outcome of the actual election. 
“The Daybreak Poll is definitely interesting because it constantly surveys the same panel of voters,” Main said. “However, I think some of the polling choices, including weighing the sample based on people’s self-reported voting in 2012 and using the 0 to 100 rating scale and the effects that these choices have on the data prove that the results of any one poll are not enough to accurately predict what will happen on election day. I look at the results of this poll on a regular basis, but I can’t base my thoughts on the state of the election on polling data alone.”

During this election season, some people are disappointed with the choices for president, to the point where they may choose not to vote at all. But there is another option — sharing your vote with someone who can’t.
Vote Allies, founded by USC alumnus Brett Shears, partners those eligible to vote with those who are ineligible to vote, such as non-citizens and those on parole. The pairs discuss politics together, and the eligible voter then casts his or her vote for whoever the ineligible voter would like to vote for.
“If you’re disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, or you’re on parole, or you’re a non-citizen or you’re under 18 and you really want to be involved in this election, we can partner you with someone and try to replicate this voter experience, so you can be involved in your own way,” said Shears, who graduated in 2015 with a master’s degree in public policy from the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
Shears has long been interested in voting rights issues, having served as the at-large representative for the city of Los Angeles’ North Area Neighborhood Development Council and as vice chair of the South Los Angeles Alliance of Neighborhood Councils, both of which advocate for local issues to the L.A. City Council.
“I shared my vote with Francisco Medina, who was appointed as a city commissioner in Huntington Park as an undocumented resident,” Shears said. “To me, he embodied that spirit of a non-citizen who’s all in for his community, who would love to vote, who influences people in his own way. We really need to recognize and validate the contribution of people like him.”
California’s June 7 primary was the first election Vote Allies was active in. Shears said that while about 60 people signed up through voteallies.org, he was only able to pair 24 people together because the number of eligible voters outweighed ineligible voters by a ratio of about 5:2. 
He said others may have participated in the same idea outside of his project.
There are 78 people signed up to participate with Vote Allies in the Nov. 8 election, but Shears said the numbers still skew about 5:2.
“We have more people who are willing to share their vote than there are disenfranchised people signing up who want to opt-in to the process,” Shears said. “It’s hard to say what the source of that is, but there’s probably a legitimate fear about not wanting to get in trouble, not wanting to do anything to rock the boat. It’s just a responsibility that people aren’t willing to take on.” 
Susan Goelz, business analyst and program assistant for the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership & Policy, is a registered Republican who plans to share her vote in the upcoming election, preferably with a student who cannot yet vote due to their age.
“I have voted in every presidential election since I could vote,” Goelz wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Now, I cannot in good conscience vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So instead of not voting, I feel the best thing for me to do rather than not vote is to give my vote to someone who feels strongly and really wants to vote, so I will ‘share’ my ballot with a person who currently does not have the ability to vote in this election.”
Voter disenfranchisement laws vary widely from state to state. In Florida, the formerly incarcerated almost never get their right to vote back, and in Vermont, officials deliver ballots to inmates behind bars. California is somewhere in the middle in terms of strictness, in which those who are currently incarcerated or on parole cannot vote.
“The lesson is no two states are identical, so there’s always going to be confusion about who can and can’t vote,” Shears said. “There are about 800,000 people who are on parole in California who cannot vote because of a felony conviction.”
The number of undocumented immigrants and minors drives the total number of people who can’t vote much higher than that. While largely symbolic because the project operates at such a small scale in its current pilot phase, Shears said the whole point of Vote Allies is to start a dialogue about voting rights and to give a voice to the voiceless in American society.
The deadline to sign up to participate in the Nov. 8 election with Vote Allies is Oct. 25.

Photo courtesy Bobak Ha’EriJust like old times · USC fans have many fond memories of the Pete Carroll era, when the Trojans won two national championships. Here, Carroll participates in the “Trojan Walk” before a game in during the 2008 season.
Despite a lackluster, defensively oriented game, Sunday afternoon was an electric return for the Los Angeles Rams in their first game in L.A. since 1994. With a rowdy crowd, an energetic Red Hot Chili Peppers pre-game concert and a much-needed home victory for the Rams, lost in the shuffle was a major storyline: Former USC head coach Pete Carroll’s first appearance at the Coliseum since leaving the school in 2009.
The coach wasn’t sure how he would be received when asked before the game.
“No idea,” Carroll said. “I don’t think there’s going to be an actual reception, I think we’re just going to start the game.”
It turns out he was largely correct. Most of the crowd’s attention seemed to be directed at the pure excitement of seeing their Rams back in Los Angeles or urging for rookie quarterback Jared Goff to replace starter Case Keenum. Goff did not play.
Carroll’s return to the Coliseum was an appealing narrative largely because of his controversial exit from USC. After amassing 83 wins, four Rose Bowl victories and two national championships during his nine seasons with the Trojans, he left abruptly following the 2009 Emerald Bowl to fill the Seattle Seahawks’ head coaching vacancy.
Six months later, the USC athletic department was hit with crippling sanctions stemming from improper benefits received by running back Reggie Bush and basketball player O.J. Mayo. The football program faced a two-season bowl ban and the reduction of 30 scholarships. Some felt that Carroll knew about the severe penalties and that his departure was a calculated measure to avoid any punishment from the NCAA.
“I regret that anybody had to go through all of that, and I’m as remorseful as I can be about that,” Carroll said of the circumstances surrounding his exit. “I think it was really off-base and out of line the way they handled it, and I felt like it was a miserable thing to do to a great university. I’ve always felt really kind of upset about that. I wish I could have done something once we realized that it was a problem, but I was already gone by the time all of that stuff came out, and I felt bad about that.”
The Trojans have not been able to replicate Carroll’s successes following his departure. Since 2010, the football program has had three head coaches, three athletic directors and a series of mediocre seasons. USC has failed to maintain national prominence since the NCAA investigations.
Carroll, on the other hand, continued his success, leading Seattle to five postseason appearances in six years and a Super Bowl championship in 2013.
However, Carroll experienced much less success in his Coliseum return than he was accustomed to when leading the Trojans. The Seahawks were stifled by the Ram’s defensive front, mustering just 67 rushing yards in a miserable 9-3 loss. After the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter, Seattle began to drive into Rams territory, but a potential game winning drive was spoiled when Alec Ogletree forced a Christine Michael fumble at the 32-yard line. The Seahawks have now lost four out of five of their last games to the Rams. Both the Rams and Seahawks have experienced little offensive success so far in their respective 2016 campaigns.
Former USC All-American and current Rams safety T.J. McDonald also made his return to the Coliseum. He recorded one tackle during his defense’s dominant performance.
Next up for Carroll and the Seahawks is a divisional matchup against the 49ers, who defeated the Rams in a 28-0 opening weekend clobbering. This Sunday, the Rams will aim to score their first touchdown since relocating in an away game at Tampa Bay.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanFreshman phenom · Khalia Lanier is already making a strong impact for the Women of Troy, leading the team with 151 kills through 11 matches.
It’s pretty strange to hear anyone mention Santa Claus in September, especially in Southern California. With a consistent sun striking campus daily, the holiday season feels much more like three years than three months away.
However, freshman Khalia Lanier, an outside hitter for the women’s volleyball team, was eager to chat about her special encounter with Old St. Nick just one year ago on her high school campus.
“There was one really sketchy day at school,” she said. “It was lunch time, and I saw Santa Claus come out of nowhere. [A woman] was in a Santa Claus shirt with a pencil skirt, heels, a beard and a Santa hat.” 
Lanier’s confusion quickly transformed to joy. 
“As she kept walking out, I realized, ‘Oh my god, that’s [Olympic volleyball medalist] April Ross,’” Lanier said. “[Ross] told me, ‘Khalia, I have a special gift for you,’ and then she pulled the Gatorade National Player of the Year trophy out of her Santa bag.”
In addition to being recognized as the top high school volleyball player in the nation last year by Gatorade, Lanier was also an Under Armour and Volleyball Magazine All-American during her career at Xavier College Preparatory in Phoenix, Arizona. And while her accolades on the court may seem innumerable to some, she is not the most-decorated athlete within her own family. 
Lanier’s father, Bob, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. After being selected first overall in the 1970 NBA Draft, Bob was an eight-time All-Star for the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks over the course of his 14-year playing career (1970-1984). Lanier’s No. 16 jersey has been retired by both the Pistons and Bucks’ organizations; it is also the number Khalia now wears as she plays for USC. 
“I was just always around sports and competition,” Lanier said on her childhood. “My dad and I are both Virgos, so we have pretty similar personalities. Whether it was playing basketball during Christmas or volleyball, I was just always competing.”
Lanier left a home with a Hall of Fame father in Arizona for a university in USC that just had one of its most iconic figures depart: former outside hitter Samantha Bricio. 
Bricio, a three-time All-American at USC, holds four major records for the women’s volleyball program: kills, attacks, service aces and points. Bricio, the 2015 Pac-12 Player of the Year, also holds the conference record for service aces. 
“Living up to her legacy is definitely going to be hard,” Lanier said about Bricio. “But, I kind of just want to make a name for myself — not fill her spot, but create a different [legacy] for myself that could possibly rival hers.”
Upon arriving to USC, Lanier has almost instantly been inserted into the starting rotation and is now one of the leading performers for the Women of Troy. 
Offensively, Lanier has been the cornerstone of the team’s attack, as she has led No. 21 USC in kills in seven of her first nine matches. In USC’s most recent victory over Maryland on Sept. 16, she tallied a team-high 13 kills. Lanier has recorded five double-doubles on the young season. Overall, she leads the team in kills and service aces.
“As a freshman, people really don’t expect you to have much of an impact,” Lanier said. “[People] want to make excuses when they don’t play well, but I’m one of those people who says, ‘I want to be good right away, and I want to fill Samantha Bricio’s role right away as a freshman.’”
Lanier’s freshman campaign got off to a slow start this season when USC (8-3) dropped its first three matches of the season — a losing streak that included the first loss to UC Irvine in program history. The Women of Troy have since rebounded from their opening struggles, winning their last eight matches since Aug. 27.
“It definitely started off bumpy,” Lanier said about this season. “We were trying a lot of different things with the offense. I definitely think our chemistry has been improving a lot over the past three weeks.”
As a true freshman, Lanier has set high expectations for herself and her team. 
“I want to be the best player I can be, “ she said. “I want to be an All-American as a freshman, I want to win freshman of the year. I have big goals for myself, but they all go towards the ultimate team goal.” 
As the team navigates through the remainder of its regular season and into the postseason, one can bet that Lanier is striving for another visit from Santa this holiday season, this time, with an NCAA trophy in the bag.

USC is not a bad team, but its 1-2 record is not an ideal situation. In their two losses to No. 1 Alabama and No. 7 Stanford, the Trojans were outscored 79-16. They scored one touchdown between the two games. You can’t really expect to win games — especially in the Pac-12 — by only scoring one touchdown.
To say the Trojans’ offense has been lackluster would be a bit of an understatement. Monday after practice, head coach Clay Helton announced that redshirt freshman Sam Darnold would replace redshirt junior Max Browne as USC’s starting quarterback.
Helton said that the “realism of football” was behind his decision for the change. 
“I wanted to see a spark in our offense,” Helton said. “I hope that Sam can bring that.”
While Darnold behind center will mix up the Trojans’ offense, a change isn’t going to do much if the playcalling and discipline doesn’t also improve. The losses also weren’t a product of Browne’s doing, but when you’ve only scored one touchdown against ranked opponents, changes on offense are necessary. 
Stanford has been victorious in seven of the last nine games against USC. That’s the best stretch of games for the Cardinal in the 111 years and 96 games the two have faced off in. With three consecutive losses to their foes up north, USC’s place as a conference power is becoming questionable. 
Senior running back Justin Davis said it best following the loss to the Cardinal. 
“If we don’t play disciplined with this talent, this talent’s going to go to waste,” he said. “That’s what makes me so mad.”
The discipline Davis is talking about can be interpreted a couple of different ways; the team’s numerous penalties that stalled momentum against Stanford, the suspensions in the first two games of the season or the coaching staff’s struggles.
The state of the Trojans can be best described as having a Ferrari and only driving it at 20 mph. USC is made up of predominantly four and five-star recruits, yet the team as a whole is playing barely at a three-star level. The Trojans showed spurts of their potential, but it’s never enough to pull out a win. 
One prime example is junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. He was talked about before the season as being one of the best receivers in college football, if not the best. That talk was justified; last season he had 89 catches for 1,454 yards with 10 touchdowns while averaging 16.3 yards per catch. This season against Stanford and Alabama, he’s had four catches for 43 yards with no touchdowns, averaging 10.8 yards. 
There are numerous factors that have affected Smith-Schuster’s play — a combination of his struggle to get open at times, Browne’s decision making and the unimaginative, conservative play calling. Though credit is due to Alabama and Stanford’s defenses for limiting his potency, the power lies in USC’s hands, it’s just a matter of whether they can do it or if they’re in over their heads. Perhaps Darnold will fare better at getting the ball into the hands of USC’s best offensive weapon. 
Part of the drive to change how they’re playing will need to come from the players’ mindsets. That’s something that they’re missing as a whole during their games. During halftime against Stanford, players could be heard shouting from the visitors’ locker room. The effects were seen at the start of the third as USC came out on fire and drove down the field. That drive resulted in a touchdown by sophomore running back Ronald Jones II — the only Trojan touchdown against a ranked opponent this season. While their fire was good for that bit of play, it wasn’t even enough to sustain through the rest of the quarter. 
On Sunday, Helton talked about the possibility of using cornerback and kick returner Adoree’ Jackson on offense “to create a spark.” The offense is struggling right now with what to do with its numerous talents, and Jackson might go unused as a result. However, just having him out on the field — whether he touches the ball or not — causes the opposing team to worry about the possibility of a dynamic talent making a big play. 
Jackson has been a standout on a team that’s been generally lackluster. Against the Cardinal, he had an interception, knocked away a pass in the endzone and made six tackles, the second most on the team. He also held Michael Rector, Stanford’s top receiver other than McCaffrey, to one catch for three yards. Against Alabama, Jackson shut down Calvin Ridley to two catches for nine yards and stopped Damien Harris just short of the end zone to save a touchdown.
USC’s problems are centered on the discrepancy between the level of talent and the coaches’ game plan. While the coaching is a portion of the issue, the blame doesn’t fall entirely on the staff. There’s already some talk about firing Helton, but while the team hasn’t been doing well, that talk is unwarranted. USC doesn’t need another head coach fired midseason. If anything, USC deserves to have one head coach for the entirety of a season. The program has been in enough turmoil after the last six years with coaching changes that it doesn’t need another. Also, the coaching staff deserves the chance to coach through a whole season and see if it can solve the problems the team is facing during the season.
The 1-2 record the Trojans are carrying into Friday’s matchup against No. 24 Utah State is the first time USC has started out 1-2 since 2001. That was Pete Carroll’s first season, and he started as 1-4. He then went on to only lose 15 more games over nine seasons. Of course, the conference is much deeper and more competitive than when Carroll started coaching, but the similarity is interesting. While the current situation looks bleak, Helton and his team have the potential to find success similar to Carroll. The team has talent, but it’s going to come down to whether or not USC can utilize it. 
For USC to turn its season around, it’s going to be on both the coaches and the players. The coaches will need to put together a game plan that utilizes the team’s vast talents. The players will need to come together under their new game plan and play with heart and discipline as a unit. 
USC’s season isn’t over yet, but if the Trojans don’t fix their problems and get a win over Utah, they will have  dug themselves a bigger hole than they can get out of.

One day, on a Sunday morning, my dad played a song called “Sunday Morning” and I really liked it. I thought the singer was really smooth, and all of the instruments that came together sounded like what a band that has great synergy should sound like. Even though I was young at the time, probably no older than seven or eight, I knew that this band and this song was something special, a cut above the rest of the pop songs playing on the radio.
 While I don’t remember “Sunday Morning” ever making it to the airwaves, I do remember “This Love” being played constantly, and while all of the adults I knew absolutely loved the song, no one my age really listened to it. To be fair, I really only knew “Sunday Morning,” “This Love” and “She Will Be Loved,” the latter of which I wasn’t really a fan of. So on the weekdays, while I was in school, I’d listen to what my friends were listening to, but on the weekends, especially Sundays, I’d say to my dad, “Hey dad, can you play that ‘Sunday Morning’ song?” And play it he did. Eventually, Maroon 5’s initial time in the spotlight came to pass, and while I didn’t forget about them, I certainly didn’t hear them as often as I used to.
 A couple years later, however, when Maroon 5 was a name that was very familiar in my high school, I was looking for something in my garage but stumbled upon a much better find: an album titled Songs About Jane. I instantly knew what this was. This was the album that had the song that made me smile on a Sunday morning. This was the album that all the adults owned and raved about when I was kid. This was the album that I didn’t know I needed in my life, but now that I did, I was going to wear it out in my car’s CD changer.
 Coming back to this album with an older mind was a blessing; the songs I was familiar with somehow sounded better with age, and there was a gaggle of incredible songs on the album that I had no idea about before I listened to it in its entirety. Furthermore, I could appreciate Maroon 5 for what they were at the time,  a band that was successfully dipping their toes in a variety of genres to make a unique sound. 
The first song, “Harder to Breathe,” immediately cranks up the intensity. The guitar has a bite to it that’s undeniable, the drums sound like they’re taken from a page of your favorite punk band and Adam Levine’s sharp vocals add to the edge that this song has. Right after this is “This Love”,” which is hard to attach to a genre as it contains elements of R&B, pop, and funk. The guitar switches from hard licks to a funky background riff that compliments the moving bass and Adam Levine’s smooth vocals on a dime.The drums are loud and hard enough to make a statement, but they maintain a controlled sound to keep the tone assertive instead of aggressive.
 The album is full of these songs that have elements from multiple genres that grab your attention and keep it occupied with catchy phrases from the instruments, such as “Shiver,” “Through With You,” “Not Coming Home” and “Tangled.” There are also songs that aren’t as aggressive but showcase the impressive range that this band had on the album. By now, “She Will Be Loved” is a karaoke classic, and the girl with the broken smile is familiar to just about everyone. This is one of Adam Levine’s most impressive songs as a vocalist. His voice sets the tone and energy of the piece and the instruments behind it seem to follow its lead. The way he plays inside the beat, how he can push and ease off the throttle and how he can jump to falsetto with ease are really what make this track special.
 But my favorite song on this album, “Sunday Morning,” is timeless  for me. A little bluesy, a little funky, a little jazzy and a little indie, this song has something for everyone. Simply put, it’s a feel good song to put on to cheer you up when you’re feeling sad, but it’s also a good song to put on when you’re happy and want to keep the good times rolling. Levine’s voice sounds smooth as silk and mixes well with the rest of the band who is. It’s a spontaneous jam session that sounds rehearsed, and the audience is listening to the band members have fun, play some great music and enjoy each other’s company.
 This album is one of the most organic I’ve ever heard, and it’s a long shot away from what Adam Levine and Maroon 5 sound like nowadays. I can’t help but feel a tinge of sadness to know that this band would become one of the biggest sellouts in music history because it seems they will never get back to this sound. Still, I’m happy they were able to make this album before the insincere garbage they’re pushing out now, so I’ll always enjoy the sounds on this album and the memories it gave me.

Diversity was the key word at this year’s Primetime Emmys, as the award show changed the conversation about race in the world of television. The ceremony proved to be a big night not only for television, but also for the actors and writers who received nominations. 
Jimmy Kimmel was arguably the highlight of the night as the host of the ceremony. Fortunately, for viewers, Kimmel’s video and monologue were exceptionally exciting as he transitioned from hit show to hit show, from The People v. O.J. Simpson to Modern Family and Veep to James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke. 
Fans of Kimmel’s show Jimmy Kimmel Live! understand his “feud” with Matt Damon. However, people who don’t watch his show would fail to grasp the nuance behind this part of the ceremony. Nevertheless, watching Damon ridicule Kimmel for his loss in the category of Outstanding Variety Talk Series to John Oliver was funny and represented a breath of fresh air from the few, but prevalent Donald Trump jokes. 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus won Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Selina Meyer in Veep for the fourth consecutive year. Jeffrey Tambor’s portrayal as a transgender woman in Transparent won him Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.
One of the biggest surprises of the night was Tatiana Maslany’s win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for BBC’s Orphan Black. Maslany won for her performance as Sarah Manning and five other clone characters in the show. After three seasons, she finally gained the attention she deserved at the ceremony this year. 
In addition, Rami Malek’s win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in Mr. Robot became a big moment in the ceremony as he became the first minority and Egyptian-American actor to win in the category since 1998. Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang also came out victorious as they were recognized for their outstanding writing in the Netflix comedy Master of None. The ceremony became a celebration for minority actors throughout the industry, from Taraji Henson’s nomination for her role as Cookie Lyon in Empire to Courtney B. Vance’s win for his leading role as Johnnie Cochran in The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.
For music lovers and anyone needing a break from constant jokes, Tori Kelly’s version of “Hallelujah” honoring late actors and actresses was angelic and truly moving. This rendition conjured fond memories of seeing David Bowie and Prince as well as Garry Marshall and Doris Roberts on the screen. This is always the saddest part of the night; however, Kelly’s voice and funny clips made this year’s memoriam tribute enjoyable to watch. 
Kate McKinnon’s Emmy speech was one of a kind because she thanked two women — Ellen Degeneres and Hillary Clinton. McKinnon’s impersonations of these two women on Saturday Night Live fueled her career. She became well known for her accurate imitations of celebrities — she also impersonates Justin Bieber. This was also the first time she won the award after being nominated four times. 
Overall, the Emmys succeeded in making a three-hour ceremony feel like an one-hour comedy show without several commercial breaks and over-the-top jokes. Kimmel was a spectacular host, Game of Thrones won for best drama series and Veep won for best comedy series. While the ceremony was a great night for celebrating television and diversity, it also served as proof that television is finally starting to mirror reality.

Photo courtesy of BrainfeederSoul good · Brainfeeder is an independent record label based on Los Angeles. They have represented many well-known artists of the electronic and hip-hop genre. They host a show every year with its artists.
On Saturday, thousands migrated to the Hollywood Bowl for Los Angeles label Brainfeeder offering performances from Thundercat, Flying Lotus, George Clinton and the Parliaments, Funkadelic, Shabazz Palaces and The Gaslamp Killer.
Brainfeeder’s annual show, which they have hosted since 2008, includes artist compiled from their label, which specializes in electronic, jazz, R&B and hip-hop music.
As the crowd gathered into the theater, psychedelic DJ Gaslamp Killer spun music that ranged from hits to more obscure tracks. 
Shabazz Palaces took the stage next for an official opening of the show. The members rapped and created music from both electronic music devices and live instruments to create an afro-futuristic hip-hop mayhem. 
As the bowl came to full capacity, Thundercat took the stage with a double-necked bass guitar. Michael McDonald of Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers fame also appeared as a special guest and performed the Doobie Brothers’ “What a Fool Believes.” McDonald also hung around with Thundercat to perform “Them Changes” to close the act.
Funkadelic featuring George Clinton and Parliament then took over the stage with dozens of back-up dancers and musicians performing a jam-session as they warmed up. The crowd went into a nostalgic world as record-topping hits played one after the other. One of his top hits from the 70s, “Flashlight,” went into a 15 minute jam-session where every musician on stage performed a solo and harmonized together. The entire audience was grooving to hits like “Atomic Dog” and “Knee Deep”. 
Songs from Kendrick Lamar, Future and Funkadelic were also mixed into the sets. The crowd danced to “King Kunta” and “The Power of that P.” Kendrick Lamar was nominated for president in the audience and the performers on stage.
The psychedelic hip-hop DJ told the crowd that he was “making a movie” about them and brought the concert to an end with a unforgettable performance.

Photo courtesy of Kathryn Nockels & Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra Super symphony · Fifteen students and alumni joined Kaleidoscope, a conductorless chamber orchestra based in Los Angeles. The group does not set ticket prices for its performances and is committed to music education by providing free concerts at schools, shelters and other public spaces.
The conductorless orchestra filled the station’s historic ticketing hall for a pay-what-you-can presentation of classical music.
Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra, the first and only conductorless orchestra in Los Angeles, packed the historic ticketing area of Union Station Friday for a performance of Charles Peck’s “Mosaic” followed by Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony (No. 6). The concert, which featured a pay-what-you-can donation table rather than the traditional ticket booth, was filled to standing-room-only by 9:40 p.m., twenty minutes ahead of its 10 p.m. start.
The ensemble features three USC alumni and twelve current students — Roberta Yee, Catherine Baker, Robert Walker, Rachel Van Amburgh, Sérgio Coelho, Elizabeth Kosko, Brendan White, Mann-Wen Lo, Alex Granger, Chiai Tajima, Tommy Dougherty, Javier Iglesias, Juliette Herlin, Levi Jones and William Wasson.
The crowd was mixed with both orchestra devotees and curious passers-by bumping elbows before the performance began — a success, per the orchestra’s self-proclaimed goal: “We want everyone in Los Angeles to have the opportunity to experience great classical music in person by a professional orchestra.” Every aspect of the show was coordinated to make that happen.
When the concert began, the musicians arranged themselves near the center of the room, with seats on all four sides. They stood up, so that attendees could watch their every interaction.
To the crowd’s uncustomary applause between the movements of Beethoven, the concert program offered a warm-hearted response: “When someone claps at a ‘less traditional’ time, it lets us know there’s someone new to classical music or who is hearing the piece for the first time, which is a wonderful thing!”
By accepting donations rather than selling tickets, Kaleidoscope drew listeners who may have shied away from other professional orchestras due to steep ticket prices and a stuffy concert atmosphere. 
What stood out on Friday was that the musicians in Kaleidoscope were clearly having fun. Without a conductor, entrances are coordinated through furtive glances and nudges, well-matched by the rambunctious musical selections. 
American composer Peck’s new work “Mosaic” comfortably shared the stage with Beethoven. The piece, a single six-minute movement, attempts to use music to replicate the aesthetic experience of viewing a handcrafted mosaic, first peering closely at the constituent materials and their individual forms, and then zooming out to take a holistic view of the composite image. 
Peck has translated the medium into music with grace and creativity. The composer builds and programs his own electronic instruments; though none are used in “Mosaic,” he mixes diverse shades on the orchestral palette with technological precision and clarity. 
At the piece’s opening, muted, scraping strings suggest the mosaic artist as she combs the beach or forest in search of raw materials. Whimsical percussion interjections evoke their diverse forms: a rusted bolt, a shard of plastic.
The melodies elongate and coalesce as the mosaic is put together, building toward a false ending which really marks the beginning of the zoom-out. Here, a xylophone bubbles around intertwined woodwinds in a captivating evocation of some subsurface scene, perhaps the forge of Prometheus or a hydrothermal vent in the Marianas.
A rich brass section cements the final section of “Mosaic,” a chorale of cosmic intensity that radiates through the orchestra before giving way to a subdued, twinkling starscape of woodwinds and high strings. The composition is stellar, and the performance left little to criticize.
The orchestra’s rendition of Beethoven’s “Sixth” was spirited and joyful. The piece, meant to represent a village scene in the early-19th century German countryside, is full of playful references to country song and dance. Kaleidoscope dashed alongside each. And in the fourth movement, which represents a thunderstorm, the performers did not relinquish the boisterous optimism that defines the symphony as a whole. Instead, they bopped their way through to the piece’s cheerful finish. 
Even when the performance paused, the orchestra brandished no clear leader. Between the two pieces, a violinist emerged from among the spruce to address the audience, then disappeared back into the fray to play his part the next piece. Kaleidoscope’s members avow that “a democratic process within the orchestra will improve the quality of the performance.” Indeed, neither piece sounded strained nor conflicted; it was evident on Friday that Kaleidoscope’s musicians are dedicated to the orchestra’s shared vision. 
Its October series will feature new music by Jee Seo, West Coast premieres of pieces by Saad Haddad and Julia Adolphe and Leoš Janácek’s “Mládí.”
The original version of this article said that three alumni and 12 current students performed. Benjamin Mitchell, Michael Basak, Eric Lea and Michale Matsuno also performed, making the total five alumni and 14 current students. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

A study conducted by a USC professor recently found that low-income communities and communities of color are far more likely to be negatively impacted by climate pollution than their counterparts. 
The report, co-authored by sociology and American studies and ethnicity professor Manuel Pastor, was released last Wednesday and showed that even though greenhouse gas emissions have decreased overall in California, many industries have actually increased their localized carbon footprints.
Common pollutants include particulate matter such as PM10, which has been linked to asthma, cancer, lung disease and heart disease. 
Such illnesses can be costly, both in terms of medical care and income lost due to missed days of work. 
Since the report states that communities who live within 2.5 miles of a greenhouse gas-emitting facility have a far higher proportion of low-income people of color, these already at-risk populations are faced with an additional threat to their health.
“Often, marginalized or impoverished communities are experiencing other socioeconomic challenges simultaneously,” said Monalisa Chatterjee, a professor of environmental sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “In this case, these communities are located in close proximity to industrial activities with high pollution levels because of limited affordability and any increase in these pollutants immediately increases their exposure.”
California chose to implement the cap-and-trade program in 2013 as a means of reducing emissions. This means that every year the state sets a cap on the amount of emissions that all greenhouse gas emitting facilities must conform to. However, if the facility emits less than its allotted amount, it is allowed to trade the remainder to another company for a profit.
One possible reason for the localized increase is a loophole that makes use of offsets — a system whereby a polluting industry can offset its pollution in California by participating and investing in greenhouse gas emission-reduction projects. These reductions are added to the industry’s total in order to meet its target emission rates. 
However, according to the report, 76 percent of offset credits were generated outside of California. 
This means that even though these greenhouse gas-emitting facilities are meeting their reduction targets, they continue to pollute their immediate vicinities, increasing the risk of health complications for nearby residents.
In California, the cap on greenhouse gas emissions has been dropping annually. In 2006, the target was to reach 1990 levels of emissions by 2020, a target that was recently updated to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. 
While these goals may be attainable at the statewide scale, Environmental Student Assembly Co-Director Joshua Blockstein said that government leaders must not ignore those who are being directly affected by pollutants in their homes, with nowhere else to go.
“It’s a shame that these already challenged communities continue to be impacted by pollution,” Blockstein said. “For residents in lower-income neighborhoods, the harmful health effects of pollution can make it even more challenging to improve their quality of life and living situation.”
Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed a statewide deal that freed up hundreds of millions of dollars from the cap-and-trade program to be used in the fight against greenhouse emissions. 
Out of some $900 million, $140 million will be channeled into helping disadvantaged communities combat local climate change. 
However, the exact strategies were not specified and it is currently unknown how the money might be used to reduce the effect of pollutants on residents.
“Systematic evaluation of climate change policy and its impact beyond the process of global warming is very important in getting it right,” Chatterjee said. “We do not want to solve a problem by creating another problem that reduces the quality of our lives and ecosystems in the long run.”

Today, Roe v. Wade remains celebrated by women’s rights activists as a definitive victory for reproductive rights. The national legalization of abortion followed heightened awareness of the pervasive, often fatal trend of self-induced abortions, typically attempted by women of impoverished immigrant families who lacked the means to raise additional children. Restricted access did not prevent abortions from happening, but only further endangered the public. A 2009 study found that today, women are much more likely to die from the procedure in countries where it is illegal compared to those where it is not. Yet the issue remains controversial to this day, primarily due to religious arguments around the morality of abortion. These arguments bred the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from going toward abortion services for women on Medicaid, to respect people of faith who oppose abortion and do not want their tax dollars contributing to it. 
This September, as the Hyde Amendment turns 40 years old, it is worth considering the many American women the landmark case of Roe v. Wade now excludes due to the 1976 passage of the amendment, and how relevant Roe v. Wade is to low-income women who cannot afford the rights it supposedly guarantees. After all, while it is within everyone’s rights to not agree with abortion, it is simultaneously within everyone’s rights to bodily autonomy, which should not be an economic privilege but a fundamental human right. 
The pro-choice movement recognizes time and again that everyone has the right to lead a life rooted in faith, but the religious values of individuals should not dictate the law in any society that claims not to be theocratic. All laws, including laws regarding taxation and public funding, should be based on the promotion of public health, the availability of constitutional and human rights for people of all socioeconomic classes and objective science regarding fetal development and viability.
The existence of the Hyde Amendment highlights an unnecessary sensitivity and double standard in the treatment the government affords people of faith. For example, anti-war progressives who opposed the Iraq War still had no choice but to watch their tax dollars pay for the deaths of thousands of born, living human beings. Opponents of war have always been denied the privilege of having their consciences respected, where, in contrast, the personal religious views of some citizens today dictate whether or not thousands of women have basic human right to terminate a pregnancy, forcing them to give birth and remain trapped in poverty.
Another issue raised by the Hyde Amendment is its reinforcement of the stigma around abortion through casting the medical procedure as something that could shock the conscience rather than regarding it as any other medical procedure covered by Medicaid insurance. Objectively speaking, abortion is a highly safe procedure which women are 14 times less likely to die from than giving birth, according to 2012 research by Columbia University. Implying that it in any way is tantamount to murder has frequently put women and abortion providers in harm’s way by inspiring retaliatory attacks from extremists such as the shooter Robert Dear, who attacked Colorado Planned Parenthood in 2015.
Ultimately, the reach of the Hyde Amendment does not stop at abortion services. Regulations on federal funding toward research on abortion infringe on the intellectual freedoms of medical professionals, and restricting their ability to research and improve the modern abortion procedure affects the living standards of all women. Still, from its earliest days, abortion has to an extent been a class issue as a procedure predominantly sought by women, often married, without access to contraception and lacking the financial means to raise children. Today, regardless of a woman’s class, the law recognizes the rights of any woman, no matter how many children she can afford to raise, to have an abortion, but this is not the case for women on Medicaid due to the Hyde Amendment.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Whole Women’s Health in the landmark case of Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt, which ruled unconstitutional a series of medically unnecessary regulations placed on abortion clinics, forcing many to shut down. The regulations struck down as undue burdens to women’s access to abortion reflect modern efforts to undercut abortion rights by placing legal obstacles around the procedure through closing clinics, mandating waiting periods and biased, misleading counseling sessions, and through the Hyde Amendment, creating economic barriers in the guise of protecting religious liberty. 
By prioritizing the personal beliefs of people of faith, legitimizing those beliefs through the law, and according these beliefs authority over the rights of low-income women, the Hyde Amendment creates a hierarchy elevating anti-choice religious peoples, and rendering low-income women second-class citizens. And as second-class citizens, the privileges of Roe v. Wade are meaningless to them.
The argument that women need a right to an abortion is based on the assumption that women are getting pregnant when they do not want to have a child. If women completely abstained from sexual relations when they did not want to have a child, they would not even need a right to abort a pregnancy that is not the result of rape. In fact, 99.5% of the abortions performed in the United States are of pregnancies that are the result of consensual sexual relations and could have been avoided if these women completely abstained from sexual relations if they did not want to have a child. Furthermore, women can learn to live without the right to an abortion if abortion becomes illegal or if abortion clinic closures make it impossible for women to obtain legal abortions.
Some of the poor women who are seeking abortions would not be choosing to have abortions if they had easier access to prenatal medical care, adoption placement agencies, and material assistance. In addition, many of the women who are seeking abortions are only willing to do so if it is legal and easily accessible. The legalization of abortion-on-demand nationwide during all 9 months of pregnancy through the Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions has actually increased overall demand for abortion in the United States, and the overall demand for abortion in the United States is much greater than it would have been if abortion were never legalized nationwide through a U.S. Supreme Court decision.

Alejandro Rivera | Daily Trojan
A simple scroll through any Trojan’s Facebook feed last week revealed the big news, shared and reshared countless times: USC topped UCLA in the 2017 U.S. News & World Report’s Best Colleges Rankings. USC ranked 23rd this year, breaking its previous tie with UCLA, which came in at 24th.
This ranking definitely gives us exciting new bragging rights over the Bruins, but it is still important for us to pause and take note that there is room for improvement, especially in the realm of affordability and overall value.  This is blatantly obvious in rankings systems that place a strong weight on financial factors, such as MONEY’s Best Colleges list. 
It is important for students to balance celebrating our U.S. News & World Report ranking with recognizing that our school still has flaws, and that it is up to students to hold the school accountable. If the student body places too much emphasis on these rankings, it runs the risk of becoming complacent in demanding change from the University. 
While the U.S. News & World Report measures overall prestige, obviously important for institutions’ abilities to attract new students, MONEY’s Best Colleges rankings measures things that may be more important to individual students themselves. 
The magazine’s methodology is broken down into three components, each with a third of overall weighting: quality of education, affordability, and outcomes. Quality of education is measured by categories such as six-year graduation rate, peer and instructor quality, and value-added graduation rate, which measures the difference between a school’s actual graduation rate and its expected rate based on the profile of its student body.
Affordability, often a hot topic on USC’s campus, is measured by the price of a degree once average aid, average student debt, student loan repayment and affordability for low-income students are applied. Measuring outcomes includes graduates’ earnings (adjusted by majors), 10-year earnings and career services. 
On the other hand, U.S. News & World Report’s methodology is much broader, and includes things that may have less importance to the individual student. It is largely reputation-based, with 22 percent of the weight placed on undergraduate academic reputation — as determined by presidents, provosts and deans of institutions, not by students themselves. Other indicators include graduation rates, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, and alumni giving rate, but nothing about financial aid or general affordability.
  In stark contrast to its comfortable top 25 ranking on U.S. News & World Report’s rankings, USC comes in at an embarrassing number 155 on MONEY’s list, which ranks schools based on whether they provide “a great education, at an affordable price, that prepares students for rewarding careers.” UCLA ranks number 20 on the list. In fact, eight out of the nine University of California undergraduate campuses are listed ahead of USC. 
 Of course, some may say that it is a given for University of California schools to beat USC in a value ranking, since they’re public schools and therefore can offer lower tuition. However, “best value” is not synonymous with “lowest tuition,” as shown by the fact that Princeton and Harvard ranked first and third respectively, despite the fact that both schools’ tuitions also top $60,000. 
However, one big separation between high-ranking schools and USC is the difference between sticker price and estimated price with average financial aid. Princeton’s tuition is $61,300, but when average aid is applied, the price is approximately one-third of that, at $20,600. Harvard’s steep $64,800 sticker price drops to $16,500 with average aid. As a public school, UCLA’s sticker price of $34,300 is close to USC’s post-aid amount, and this sticker price drops to around $13,000 once average aid is applied.
Of course, we’re all aware that our school is expensive. Any Trojan will tell you that mentioning USC is often accompanied by a comment about the school’s sky-high tuition, or mentioning of the moniker “University of Spoiled Children.” It would be one thing if we could respond to those comments with, “Yes, but it’s worth the money.” MONEY’s college rankings prove that there’s room for USC to add value to its high tuition, which has been accompanied by lacking transparency. These rankings suggest that there are 154 schools out there who provide their students with more value, and the majority charge less in tuition. 
 So in the spirit of cross-town rivalry, celebrate the rankings victory over UCLA. But remember, they’re beating us in other rankings, and MONEY’s list suggests that their students are getting more bang for their buck. With near-annual tuition raises and a sticker price of over $67,000, we should demand the same. U.S. News & World Report provides a reason to rejoice, but MONEY gives us a clear list of things we can improve upon.

Redshirt freshman Sam Darnold will replace redshirt junior Max Browne as USC’s starting quarterback, head coach Clay Helton announced after Monday’s practice.
Helton attributed the decision to wanting to change up the offense after its struggles earlier in the season. 
“When you’ve scored one touchdown against Stanford and Alabama, I wanted to see a spark in our offense,” Helton said. 
But the coach stopped short of criticizing Browne, who has completed 55 of 87 passes this season for two touchdowns.
“I truly appreciate how honorably Max has played and competed,” Helton said. “He’s done it with extreme honor and class. He is not the reason we are 1-2. He is not the scapegoat here.”
Darnold, who was locked in a fierce battle with Browne for the starting job throughout camp but ultimately lost out to the redshirt junior, will take over the reins from Browne just three games into the season.
“I was stoked to finally get that opportunity,” Darnold said. “Max competed his butt off. It was a coach’s decision. I’m ready whenever coach puts me in just like any other game.”
The redshirt freshman has seen playing time in all three games this season. He is 14-of-22 passing, accruing 136 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.
Helton said he met with both quarterbacks last night and wanted to give Darnold a chance at taking over the offense. 
“It’s not that Max played bad,” he said. “The ball was not getting in the end zone. I looked at the opportunity that Sam has had. I look at the opportunities Sam has had and what he did. Knowing he was very talented but not knowing how he performed in ball games. He was given that opportunity in the first three games and did a very good job at it.” 
Darnold performed well beyond his years during camp. The accomplished recruit out of San Clemente High School forced the issue during practices with an impressive display of his dual-threat abilities.
Standing 6-foot-4 at 225 pounds, Darnold has been praised for his strong instincts and ability to run the ball.
Browne admitted to being disappointed about the decision, and said he had an inkling that a change was in the works the way Darnold received playing time in each of the first three games. Darnold played two series against Alabama, the entire fourth quarter against Utah State and the last drive of the game against Stanford. 
“Just by the way Sam was sprinkled in there, you kind of know [a change was coming],” Browne said. “When you’re losing ball games, it’s not easy on anyone. After I watched the film, I was better than I thought. [The switch] surprised me for sure. I’d be lying if I said otherwise.”
Browne said he regrets not connecting on more deep balls, which could have changed the tone of the offense. For now, he will stay ready as the backup — Browne was the backup to Cody Kessler for two seasons before taking over this season. 
“I know how these things work,” Browne said. “Once the young guy goes, you know how it is. But I’ll be ready. I owe it to my teammates and the guys I’ve been with four years now. I’ll be ready at a moment’s notice.”
Helton, though, described Darnold as an “every down” quarterback and mentioned that redshirt sophomore quarterback Jalen Greene could be used in certain packages. 
“It’s only Week 4,” Browne said, while admitting he was considering options for his football future. “There’s a lot of ball to play. I’ll stay ready. It’s been like that for all my career.”
USC’s next game is on Friday against No. 24 Utah on the road.

If you ever want to add spice to your life, Indian food is the way to go. Here are three of my favorite Indian recipes that you must try at least once.
Courtesy of Guru’s Cooking
Marinate chicken in about ½ teaspoon of – turmeric powder, salt, chili powder, coriander powder, chopped cilantro, chilies, and mint for two hours. Soak two cups of basmati rice for 30 minutes and then cook until half-done. Take a pan and add 4 teaspoons of oil along with four of cloves, cardamom, one spoon cumin seeds. Once you see this crackling, add green chilies and garlic. Put in the marinated chicken, put a lid on it 15-20 min and then sauté.
Lastly, add the cooked basmati rice to this pan and leave it for 10 min, garnish with cilantro and caramelize. Serve hot with yogurt as a dip!

Peel and cut potatoes in the shape of wedges and soak them in salt water for 30 minutes. Sprinkle salt, chili powder, and flour along with a little cornstarch on the potatoes. You can deep fry these or, alternatively, bake them until they are cooked. Use another pan and add 1.5 tablespoon oil, chilies, garlic to sauté! Add onions, bell peppers, chili powder, red chili sauce, water and sugar, and ½ tablespoon of oya sauce.
Let this thicken and add ¾ tablespoon corn starch to ¾ cup of water, stir well and pour in pan. Add potatoes and garnish with spring onions.
