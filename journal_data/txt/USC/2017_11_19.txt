USC researchers recently demonstrated how brain implants can be used to improve the long-term memory of humans, which has the potential to treat damaging diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. 
At the Society for Neuroscience conference in Washington, D.C. earlier this month, USC professors Dong Song and Theodore W. Berger and Wake Forest University professors Robert Hampson and Sam Deadwyler presented findings about the brain implant device from the past three years.
The overall goal of the project, which has been going on for over 20 years, is to construct a “memory prosthesis” device that restores the memory function of the brain through the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is critical for the formation of long-term memory. According to Song, patients with brain-impairing diseases or injuries were each found to have a malfunctioning hippocampus. 
“Even though these patients can remember some old memories, they can no longer generate new long-term memory, [and] can remember things for only a short period of time,” Song said. “We are trying to fix that using an engineering approach, so we built a mathematical model to describe how the hippocampus processes information.”
Song said the device starts by recording the brain’s activity patterns. After processing this information with a computational model, the implant predicts what the correct signal should be, and through small electric shocks that stimulate the hippocampus, it mimics normal brain activity and writes in that signal back to the hippocampus. 
“The hippocampus is much like a bridge back to the neocortex [which regulates conscious thought], and what we achieved now is basically proof of that principle,” Song said. “We recorded from the stimulation of a very small number of neurons, [and] we showed that the memory functions at a certain level.”
With this device, the researchers conducted hundreds of trials with 20 epileptic patients who had implanted brain electrodes. In each trial, the team had patients perform a simple memory task. First they were introduced to an image, which ranged in complexity from standard clip art to something more abstract and difficult to name. This image then vanishes, and after a variable delay, which increased with every subsequent trial, patients were then shown several images, from which they had to select the correct one.
“Based on the performance, [we got] the forgetting curve of the patients’ memory — from a certain length of delay, patients have good memory, [but with] a longer delay, [their memory] is not as good,” Song said. “From this device, we are trying to prove that we can get this curve to go upwards, and the percentage of the correct response was higher.”
According to the team’s study, the device can boost memory performance by up to 30 percent, but Song believes that this is only the starting point in the team’s research. He hopes the team will be able to develop a clinical, wired device that patients can wear or have implanted into their brains to improve and restore long-term memory for the rest of their lives. 
“I personally want to solve a problem, like fix a certain disease,” Song said. “We need to make the device more general, more powerful, [and be able to] last longer, do multiple memory tasks and be truly implantable, so it’s still a long way to go.” 
Interesting research being conducted.

On Nov. 5, members of SC Auto Society were invited to a car showing at Pagani Newport Beach by a USC alumnus. Photo courtesy of Steven Chang.
Starting this semester, a new club on campus is helping students explore their interest in all things automobile. 
SC Auto Society, which was officially chartered in Fall 2017, creates an environment on campus for all car enthusiasts, welcoming undergraduate students, graduate students, alumni and even faculty  members to become involved in and knowledgeable about cars. Its members organize drives, go to car meets, attend car shows and visit auto museums, said William Squires, the club’s vice president.
“The SC Auto Society is a essentially a club of people who love cars,” Squires said. “The car enthusiast community is one of the most welcoming communities. You don’t even have to have a car to be in the club. There are some expensive cars in the club and some inexpensive cars, but no one is treated any differently by what car you have.” 
President Steven Chang started SC Auto Society because he believed that there were a lot of car enthusiasts who had no place to go, especially after a previous club, Auto Club of SC, ended three years ago. In addition, Chang thought the club would be a good way to keep in contact with his friends and expand his network. 
“It has allowed me to meet a lot of alumni or conduct events with alumni,” Chang said. “The whole philosophy or mission statement of this club is to bring together people who wouldn’t normally hang out. We’re able to bring together international students, kids from the East Coast, both boys and girls and those all over California.” 
Becaues SC Auto Society is a new club this semester, the organization’s executive board is primarily focusing on building a solid foundation. To expand the club’s reach to the Trojan community, the board developed a logo, created special car stickers and ordered apparel. 
So far, most of the club’s events consist of going to car shows and meets that car dealerships or other schools host, Chang said. The point is to park your cars, have them on display and talk to others about what kind of cars they’re interested in and what features they added to their cars, and to get to know them on a personal level, according to Squires.
Car shows, which typically occur on Saturday or Sunday mornings, allow people to bring their own cars and to meet new people, Chang added. 
“At these car shows, people from all over the area will come and bring whatever they have,” Chang said. “Some of them have themes, so a theme might be exotic super cars with Lamborghinis or Ferraris. Typically, they’ll have a sponsor, so it’s a way for a company to get their name out there or for a club like us to interface with the community.”
So far, the largest event the SC Auto Club’s board has organized was a car show held on Nov. 5 at Pagani Newport Beach. Originally, the show was meant to be a small gathering for only USC students so the club could get some exposure through pictures and social media, according to Chang. 
However, after getting more involved and reaching out, several other schools — including Chapman University, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, Loyola Marymount University and Palos Verdes High School — showed up. 
“I was sort of in the process of putting together a league of all of these car clubs in California,” Chang said. “We’re friends with about 15 schools now and so it was nice to meet all of these people for the first time after talking to them for months, so it was my favorite car show.” 
Squires hopes SC Auto Society will continue to be an inclusive and prominent club in future years. He also aspires to help the club host its own show along Trousdale Parkway, with dealerships and possibly famous car collectors like Jay Leno and David Lee.
“I would really like to have a car show in the spring semester on the USC campus,” Chang said. “Not only would we be able to get our name out there, but it would give students a chance to show their cars, meet more people and hopefully get more alumni involved. The end goal is to also provide a way for students to meet alumni not just through panels or for networking and school-related events, but through hobbies.” 
Can anyone tell me how to reach Steven Chang about the SC Auto Society.  The article does not mention how to get involved. Thank you.

“The Magic of Christmas at Hogwarts Castle” is a digital light projection show choreographed to the Harry Potter film series’ soundtrack. Photo courtesy of Universal Studios Hollywood.
True to form, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood will ring in the spirit of the holiday season with a touch of magic. Starting Nov. 24 and running daily through Jan. 7, 2018, the all-new “Christmas in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter” celebration will feature festive entertainment, dazzling decorations, holiday cuisine and a formidable main attraction — an animated light show projected onto the towering Hogwarts castle.
“The holidays are such a wonderful time of year and this year is particularly special for us here at Universal Studios Hollywood as we set the stage for a brand new holiday tradition with the arrival of ‘Christmas in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,’” said Karen Irwin, president and COO of Universal Studios Hollywood, at a press conference. 
The quaint shops lining the cobblestoned streets ofHogsmeade Village will be adorned with festive decorations themed to each individual storefront, including snow-capped rooftops. The Three Broomsticks will introduce a seasonal menu rife with holiday fare, comprising roast turkey and gravy, pigs in blankets, a medley of hearty vegetables and Christmas pudding. Most notably, beverage selections will include the long-awaited return of hot Butterbeer. 
Clad in Hogwarts robes representing all four houses and carrying giant frog puppets, the a cappella Frog Choir will perform original holiday songs and skits nightly, their voices accompanied by the rhythmic, throaty croaking of their frogs. 
Hogwarts Castle will be transformed multiple times every evening with “The Magic of Christmas at Hogwarts Castle,” a digital light projection show choreographed in cadence with a musical arrangement from the soundtrack of the film series. The surface of the castle will screen a downpour of snow flurries, dozens of floating lanterns, dancing castle ghosts, vibrant ribbons of light, images of Hogwarts students dancing at the Yule Ball and a Christmas tree emanating from its tallest tower. The show is replete with a finale featuring a fully lit castle and bursts of fireworks in the night sky. 
The event will also introduce a brand new line of specialty keepsakes, Harry Potter memorabilia and holiday gift-giving items. Collectibles include stockings, decorative snow globes, a collection of house-themed tree toppers and pennant garlands and custom-made, customizable Hogwarts crest and mascot ornaments. 
“Millions of guests visiting from around the world have already experienced the incredible offerings of this immersive land,” Irwin said. “This exciting new holiday program further expands the Harry Potter universe by bringing some of the holiday spirit from the films to life for guests to experience for themselves. Just like in the Harry Potter films, Christmas will come to life all around us.”

Groundwork Coffee Company is just one of the many quirky coffee shops located in the Arts District. Photo from Yelp.
Los Angeles, a highly sought-after mecca for visionaries and artists, provides visitors with diverse neighborhoods to experience. Downtown Arts District deserves its fair share of praise for its culinary, drink and entertainment offerings. At first glance, the warehouse-filled region of the city appears unassuming, but the innovation within the restaurants and museums certainly is not. 
Time to Eat
With Instagram-worthy food being a requirement for diners, the Arts District cuts no corners. The first of its delicious “must-try” eateries is Manuela, an American restaurant that serves a rustic menu with delicious proteins, seasonal vegetables and exceptional wine pairings. Both the atmosphere and eclectic decor add a welcoming touch.
Another location is Pizzanista, a pizzeria offering funky deals during the week. If you’re able to make it in on a Tuesday, the restaurant offers a variety of toppings for just $2. Each Sunday, it prepares macaroni and cheese pizzas that taste as good as they look. In addition to the pizza selections, both regular and gluten free, Pizzanista serves brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Bäco Mercat rounds off the trifecta of “must-try” eateries in the Arts District. The restaurant serves delicious Spanish fusion foods paired with spicy cocktails. The spot’s interior design is architecturally reminiscent of major cities Barcelona and Madrid, and is sure to make patrons feel fully immersed in the beauty of Spain.
Caffeine Craze
College students are always on the hunt for a comforting cup of caffeine to power through a paper, test or looming finals. From quiet cafes to joints brimming with vibrant music, the district is a go-to destination for blends of the best beans. Three quintessential spots for coffee include Groundwork Coffee Co., an organic small-batch roasting company; Eat Drink Americano, accompanying American cuisine with the perfect brew; and The Springs, part coffee shop, part yoga studio and juice bar. Each of these establishments offers a full range of espressos, drip coffees, lattes and teas. 
Fun Activities
After filling their stomachs with a hot cup of coffee or dining at a delicious new spot, visitors are encouraged to appreciate various art installations throughout the district, whether they are housed in galleries or displayed on the streets and sidewalks themselves. First on the list of must-visits is Art Share LA. The vibrant building is covered in large murals and eclectic designs. While the exterior piques interest, the true magic happens within the studio, which offers art and dance classes as well as a museum of installations.
For an authentic weekend experience in the Arts District, one must visit the local farmers market. Located on East 3rd Street, the outdoor market hosts a variety of vendors selling organic produce, flavorful foods and even Salt and Straw ice cream. In addition to food offerings, clothing and household accessories are also up for sale.
The Arts District is also home to the Animal Museum, a first-of-its-kind museum devoted to the protection and advocacy of all animals. At the museum, visitors can view education and interactive exhibitions centered on animal rights that chronicle the history of animal protection in the United States through artwork, photography and various artifacts. Upcoming events include Animal Protection: An American Movement, Bunny Mania and My Dog is Home.
From Alameda to 1st Streets, the Arts District exudes a particular character inherent to the city of artists. While the inhabitants battle the issue of gentrification, many are eager to keep the authentic aura of creativity. By way of inventive restaurants, comfortable coffee shops, entertainment and commerce, the Arts District bolsters the diversity within the bustling city.

Charlotte Gainsbourg is a quiet rock star. Born and raised in Paris to singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg and actress Jane Birkin, she made her musical debut at just 12 years old on her father’s song “Lemon Incest,” and released an album with him three years later. 
Since then, Gainsbourg has only released three albums, and on each one she has struggled to find the right way to describe her experiences and feelings through her music. But on her fifth studio album Rest, Gainsbourg finally told the world exactly how she felt.
Seven years in the making, the album is relatively short, with only 11 tracks totaling 50 minutes in length. The album is mostly sung in French, but even those who do not understand the language can still feel the heartache and poignancy the album embodies.  Rest brings together an all-star group of producers and songwriters, including legendary singer-songwriters Paul McCartney and Dev Hynes, best known as Blood Orange. But the album was mostly produced by French electronica producer SebastiAn. Rest is also the first album that features Gainsbourg’s own lyrics — and it shows. 
The album is emotional. Each lyric is a raw insight into the mind of a woman who is known to be notoriously shy and prone to bottling up painful heartaches. Gainsbourg’s words deal with alcoholism and are sung with the sadness, anger and grief that often accompany stories of addiction. It is Gainsbourg trying to grapple with her father’s death years ago, the recent death of her sister and learning how to move on from darkness. In short, it sounds as if the electronic taste of St. Vincent’s last album Masseduction and the melancholic sound of Lana Del Rey came together to break listeners’ hearts. 
Rest is Charlotte Gainsbourg’s fifth studio album and took seven years in the making. Photo courtesy of Because Music.
The stand out track on this album is “Kate.” It was inspired by Gainsbourg’s late half-sister, the photographer Kate Barry, who died in Paris in 2013. Her death was ruled a suicide. Devastated, Gainsbourg fled Paris. The pain the city brought her after her sister’s death was one she could no longer bear, so she packed her things and moved to New York City. “Kate” is sung entirely in French and shows Gainsbourg at her best. The lyrics are clever, witty and a despairing reflection on the heartbreak of losing her sister. 
“Rest,” sung in both French and English, is the most poetic song on the album. In French, she says, “Prend-moi la main, s’il te plaît,” which translates to, “Take my hand, please.” Then in English she whispers, “We’re walking in the air / We’re floating in the moonlit sky.” The song is a soft, gentle lullaby that romantically embraces listeners.
On “I’m a Lie,” her voice sounds exactly like her mother, Jane Birkin, when she sang in the song, “Je t‘aime moi non plus,” with her father. As the album continues, the tone becomes darker. Her whispers become faint, yet harsher at the same time. The cheerful beats stop dropping as frequently as they used to and listeners are left alone with only Gainsbourg and her vocals. 
“Les Oxtails” ends with a clip of presumably a baby Gainsbourg singing a song to the tune of the children’s alphabet song. For a long moment, there is silence before an electronic beat drops over baby Gainsbourg’s voice, a tribute to the innocence of childhood — a time where, for once, things used to be OK.
The melodies produced in the album are familiar to the listener. For instance, “Deadly Valentine,” which was initially released as a single, sounds exactly as if Selena Gomez took over a throwaway track from The Weeknd’s last album. 
When asked about the song, Gainsbourg told Spin, “The song mixes wedding vows with an offbeat tone. I wanted to express the idea of a lifetime engagement: a couple running to church, from childhood to old age, a lifetime path.”
Still, there is something very genuine and personal about each beat and melody Gainsbourg sings over. Rest is not perfect, nor is it supposed to be. In this personal album, Gainsbourg has finally found a niche for herself. She has found an artistic style that balances the worlds both inside and outside of her, and was able to use the music to effectively release the darkness that has been inside of her for so long. This is Gainsbourg’s best album to date — it’s the one where she finally found her voice and proclaimed it, though quietly, to the rest of the world.

Appropriation of Asian food — or any ethnic food — is a touchy subject. Oftentimes, self-proclaimed ethnic “food connoisseurs” assert that they simply are enjoying the fine delicacies of the continent — that they have a right to duplicate or take inspiration from a culture. After all, it’s just food, right? 
That’s what two white South African men thought when they opened up an Asian-inspired restaurant, that serves ramen, Korean barbecue and poké in Johannesburg. Even more problematic is the restaurant’s original name, Misohawni (which sounds innocuous at first listen), a crude reference to Vietnamese sex workers during the Vietnam War. 
“Me love you long time” is a sexual innuendo targeted at Asian women, but during the Vietnam War era, the phrase was tied to Vietnamese women — namely, sex workers — who spoke fragmented English to American GIs. Today, Asian women still remain targets of hypersexualization, fetishization and acts of sexual violence. 
Beyond the restaurant’s ignorant and tasteless namesake is the true problem: mindless replication of Asian cuisine for capitalistic gain, without a shred of cultural respect or understanding of those ethnic foods’ roots. This argument applies to the food of all global cultures.
While there are strong arguments that food should not belong to anyone, that a worldly, mixed palate is the result of cultural globalization, especially in Western countries, cultural respect is necessary, even when profiting off foods central to an ethnic group’s identity. The Washington Post published an article titled, “Should white chefs sell burritos?,” which asked a controversial, yet important question.
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Food represents an ethnic group’s rich culture — it is a central part of its soul that ties generations of people together. From pho to bun bo Hue to thit kho, I feel like I know my native country despite having never set foot in it. Growing up, my parents took me to Vietnamese restaurants, and my mother cooked authentic dishes for dinner every night.
It’s a part of my identity, and when individuals outside my ethnic culture try to replicate Vietnamese cuisine in an “Americanized” manner, I feel robbed. 
For example, a white chef went viral on Bon Appétit Magazine’s Facebook page for hosting a video showing the internet how to properly eat pho from his own Asian fusion restaurant in Philadelphia. Although the video can be construed as well-intentioned, the chef has previously shamed Asian-owned restaurants for their techniques in cooking pho in a now-deleted Instagram post. This imperialistic righteousness needs to end.
Admittedly, although fusion eateries and variations of ethnic foods have become widely popular, it’s necessary for chefs and restaurant owners to pay respectful homage to the culture that inspires their creations.
Think of it as artistic plagiarism when a chef or a restaurant owner blatantly disregards the ethnic source of culinary creation. I have no problem with people who immerse themselves into different cultures to learn about their foods, the culinary techniques and social significance of what’s made in the kitchen, but there must be respect from those bred outside the culture. They must recognize they are outsiders here to observe and potentially contribute, but only because that culture opened its doors to them.
In addition to respect, there is another controversial factor when a non-ethnic person begins to profit off ethnic cuisine at the expense of its original community. These communities are often marginalized and disrespected for their immigrant lifestyles and strange foods, while Americanized versions of their cuisine are usually embraced as hip and fresh. 
In a city like Los Angeles, there’s a never-ending list of the new eateries, some fusion, some solely inspired by ethnic foods, some original (although, what’s original in L.A.?). Yet, the city is still dominated by pockets of marginalized ethnic communities, and The Post article’s question, “Should white chefs sell burritos?” is a loaded one, considering the effects of gentrification and rising land prices in the city. A non-ethnic person should consider the consequences of opening up a restaurant in a location near authentic competitors, which are usually family-run. 
Eat the food, but respect the culture and the people.

After two regular season losses to UCLA, the men’s water polo team entered the MPSF championship game with an automatic NCAA championship berth on the line — and claimed it with a 7-5 win over the Bruins on Sunday in Palo Alto. 
The Trojans entered the tournament seeded fourth, securing two wins against Penn State Behrend and Stanford to make it to the championship matchup, where they defeated the Bruins.
The Trojans kicked off the tournament with a dominant 17-2 win over fifth-seeded Penn State Behrend Friday morning. USC took an early 3-0 lead before allowing the Bears a goal in the first quarter. The Trojans then took control with a 14-goal streak, allowing the Bears their only other goal in the fourth quarter. 
Sophomore 2-meter Sam Slobodien led the Trojans with 4 goals, while sophomore driver Marin Dasic, senior utility Bryce Hoerman and senior 2-meter Lachlan Edwards each tallied 2. Goalies McQuin Baron, a senior, and Will Rubschlager, a sophomore, gave up a goal each and racked up a total of nine saves. 
On Friday afternoon, the Trojans faced top-seeded host team Stanford in a game that would determine who would make it to Sunday’s championship matchup. USC took an early 3-0 lead before Stanford fired back to end the first quarter down 3-1. The Cardinal cut down the Trojans’ lead early in the second, but the Trojans held on to the lead to end the half 6-3. 
Freshman driver Marko Vavic and senior driver Matteo Morelli added on to the Trojans’ lead in the third, while Baron kept the Cardinal at bay. Edwards and Vavic both scored in the fourth to up the lead to 10-3, with Stanford scoring 2 goals late in the fourth to end the game 10-5. 
Against UCLA, the game was kept scoreless until Morelli broke through about five minutes into the first quarter, putting USC up 1-0. Senior utility James Walters and Edwards scored again in the start of the second, giving USC yet another 3-0 lead before UCLA’s Max Irving put the Bruins on the board. The teams traded goals to end the half with a 4-2 USC lead.
UCLA scored early in the third quarter to cut USC’s lead down to one, but USC’s Morelli responded to give the Trojans a 5-3 edge. With less than two minutes left in the period, the Bruins broke through to score again. 
Both teams were held scoreless until the last three minutes of the fourth quarter. In a span of 11 seconds, USC’s Edwards and UCLA’s Nicholas Saveljic both scored, leaving the Trojans with a slim 6-5 lead with 2:42 left in the game. Baron prevented the Bruins from breaking through in the final minutes, and the Trojans scored with 1:29 left in the game to seal their 7-5 win and the 2017 MPSF Championship. 
With the win, the Trojans secure an automatic berth and top seed in the NCAA Championships, to be held Dec. 2 and 3 at USC’s own Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The Trojans look to avenge last year’s overtime championship loss to Cal by securing the program’s 15th national championship under head coach Jovan Vavic.

Junior forward Leah Pruitt scored the Trojans’ only goal against Baylor on Friday, but it wasn’t enough as USC lost on penalties. Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The ninth-ranked women’s soccer team saw its season end on Friday in a shootout loss to Baylor in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in College Station, Tex. 
In the first round, USC had topped Eastern Washington 2-1 in a double-overtime thriller, and the Bears had bested Rice 3-2. The defending national champions’ repeat bid came to an end against Baylor, as the Trojans fell in a penalty shootout after battling to a 1-1 overtime tie.
The first half was a back-and-forth affair, as the Women of Troy outshot the Bears 7-2 but were unable to find the back of the net. Both teams landed a few scoring opportunities, but thanks to stellar play from redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kaylie Collins, the score remained 0-0 through the opening 45 minutes.
The Trojans broke through in the second half, scoring the opening goal in the 72nd minute. Junior forward Erika Okuma launched a cross from just inside midfield into Baylor’s penalty box. The ball found the head of junior forward Leah Pruitt, who guided the pass inside the frame to give the Trojans a 1-0 lead.
The Women of Troy controlled the momentum of the game for the remainder of the second half, with Collins denying a handful of late scoring chances for Baylor. The clock wound down to the final seconds of the game, and it appeared as if USC was going to advance to the third round of the tournament. 
But with 27 seconds on the clock, the Bears rocketed a shot on target for the USC frame. Collins made a flying save to deflect the ball onto the crossbar. However, junior defender Sarah King recovered the rebound and buried a point-blank shot into the back of the Trojans’ net, knotting the score with just 16 seconds remaining. 
The score held until the end of regulation, and USC headed to its third consecutive overtime matchup (it also went to overtime in its regular-season finale against UCLA). The Trojans saw notable scoring opportunities from freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo and senior midfielder Nicole Molen, but neither team could best the other in 20 minutes of overtime play. The game would be decided by penalty kicks. 
USC won the coin toss and elected to shoot second. Senior midfielder Caitlin Schwartz blew the ball past Collins on the Bears’ first attempt. USC did not answer, as freshman forward Tara McKeown’s shot was stopped by the keeper. Baylor notched another goal on its second attempt; once again, USC followed up with a miss. The third round was scoreless for both sides, and on Baylor’s fourth attempt, King clinched the shootout victory with a shot that rolled underneath a diving Collins.
After a disappointing end to the team’s championship defense, head coach Keidane McAlpine praised a strong Baylor team.
“First and foremost, I have to say congratulations to a Baylor team that showed great fortitude in coming back that late in the game and then finding a way to end it in the penalties,” McAlpine said.
McAlpine also made sure to thank his seniors at the end of a long campaign.
“They just helped us change the program — from the title last year to establishing ourselves this year as one of the top teams in a year where most people did not think we could get it done,” McAlpine said. “I am extremely disappointed for them but at the same time extremely proud of them and the legacy they have left.”
The Women of Troy concluded their season with an overall record of 15-3-2. Although the season may not have ended the way the team, coaches or fans had hoped, the Trojans have now qualified for the NCAA Tournament four years in a row, setting up a bright future for USC’s young, talented roster.

Eric He | Daily Trojan
When UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen found a wide open Jordan Lasley in the end zone for his third touchdown of the night on Saturday, I groaned.
Not because it cut USC’s lead to just 5 points with plenty of time remaining in the fourth quarter, but because I realized that, in the likely scenario of USC hanging on to win, I would be writing the same column that I had written essentially all season long — how the football team has been good enough to win most of its games, but performs poorly enough to warrant criticism. This is why the Trojans are on the outside looking in on the playoff.
On Saturday, the theme continued. USC, ranked No. 11, was victorious but never really pulled away from an unranked UCLA team fighting to just be bowl eligible. The Trojans didn’t really take advantage of the worst run defense in the Pac-12, racking up just 153 yards when UCLA’s opponents had been averaging 302 rushing yards per game. And USC’s secondary was porous, allowing Rosen to go off for 421 yards in the air, completing 32 of 52 passes. Lasley, who finished with 204 yards, had nearly more receiving yards than the entire USC receiving corps, which recorded just 264 as a unit.
“I don’t think any game is perfect, but our kids did what was needed to be done to win a hard-fought ball game,” head coach Clay Helton said.
Rinse, wash, repeat. The only thing missing in the postgame presser was a “control our own destiny” quote. 
So, in the spirit of not regurgitating another downtrodden Monday reaction column and reminding myself why I even have this column, it’s important to touch on the simple fact that we should appreciate what we are watching, that we sports pundits who critique and rip apart players and pretend to be smarter than the coaches need to not forget why we signed up for this life in the first place.
We would be nothing without the atmosphere that sports creates — the storylines, the thrill of covering a big game or the drama leading up to a big moment late in a game. And USC’s season, for better or for worse, has had it all.
Case in point: Saturday night. National television. Primetime. USC vs. UCLA. Sam Darnold vs. Josh Rosen. 82,407 people packing the Coliseum. Any sports fan would love to be in the stadium. And we were treated to a good game, with both Darnold and Rosen showing off why they are the two best quarterback talents in college football — Darnold with his scrambling ability and improvisational skills and Rosen with his laser, NFL-ready arm. Perhaps in 20 years, after both have had successful professional careers, we’ll look back at Saturday and think, “Remember the time we were fortunate enough to watch Darnold and Rosen play each other in college?”
But we don’t think that way, at least not right now. After the game, Rosen was asked about UCLA’s red zone problems, about whether he agreed with his coach’s decision (RIP, Jim Mora) to kick a field goal instead of going for it on fourth down when a drive stalled in the USC red zone in the fourth quarter. Darnold was questioned about why he didn’t throw the ball away before halftime instead of running and being tackled inbounds as time expired, costing the Trojans at least 3 points.
To be clear, these are legitimate questions to ask. But sometimes, when we get deep into the analysis, when we alleged sports experts decide to point out Darnold’s percentage completion in the red zone at home in the third quarter of a night game when his team is trailing, we lose track of the big picture, of why we watch sports in the first place.
We don’t watch sports to break down stats — at least I don’t. I watch for the memorable moments. Moments like redshirt sophomore long-snapper Jake Olson getting to play. Moments like Darnold leading a frantic late-game comeback to beat Texas in front of a sellout crowd at the Coliseum. Moments like redshirt junior cornerback Ajene Harris tackling Utah quarterback Troy Williams short of the goal line to save the game. I’ll even enjoy watching players like Rosen or Arizona quarterback Khalil Tate work their magic against USC, because I appreciate greatness and don’t take it for granted.
Unfortunately, I’ve strayed away from that this season, which is partially my own doing, but also because the Trojans have been objectively underwhelming almost every single Saturday. 
Still, that’s not an excuse to ignore why we show up to work every single week. We don’t show up to the press box to rip Sam Darnold. We show up because every game, we might witness something special, something exciting, something we have never seen before. USC will have two more games in its 2017 campaign. That’s two more games to — instead of sulk and complain about where USC’s season ended up — soak in, experience and realize just how lucky we are to be sports fans.

Last Thursday, New York University announced that it would waive tuition fees for students affected by Hurricane Maria, which caused mass destruction to the island of Puerto Rico in September. As a part of the university’s “Hurricane Maria Assistance Program,” students will also be relieved of their responsibilities to pay for housing, health insurance and meal plans. 
NYU was the latest to join a group of major universities currently offering support to the island, whose colleges are closed due to structural damages and a lack of access to essential utilities. Also offering tuition-free semesters are Brown, Cornell and Tulane universities.   
Among this outpouring of support from universities across the country, one must question why USC has remained silent on the issue, rather than match the efforts of its community of Puerto Rican students. According to a Daily Trojan report last month, students have been leading efforts on campus and in the greater Los Angeles area to raise awareness about the needs of Puerto Ricans, contact politicians and donate money and supplies to the island. In an October email memorandum to students, Provost Michael Quick provided a list of resources available for students affected by recent tragedies, including Hurricane Maria, the Las Vegas shooting, the earthquake in Mexico and wildfires in California. However, the memo did not mention policy changes or particular efforts by the University to support those affected by these disasters. 
Despite the University’s promise to take care of the Trojan Family, it seems to be neglecting a key demographic of its diverse student body. Although they do not necessarily constitute the majority of the USC community, Puerto Ricans and others affected by the hurricane deserve more than a few paragraphs in an email, but concrete policies and resources that will improve their living standards.
Students generally struggle with USC’s tuition rate — which appears to be rising with each coming year — along with the costs of other necessities, from housing to meal plans. Those affected by Hurricane Maria are already dealing with significant economic and emotional trauma, and they do not need more on their plates. Knowing that it has fundraised nearly $6 billion over the past few years, USC has the resources to reconsider how it financially supports these students. 
Of course, it is important to note the usage of the word “reconsider.” USC does not have the absolute obligation to remove all fees for every student affected by the crisis. Sure, the University should do everything it can, but within reason. That means tackling the situation case by case: If a student’s family income has been severely compromised, then they should be entitled to financial compensation for the semester. If a student demonstrates a definite ability to pay for tuition regardless of the hurricane, then perhaps the University’s money would be better spent elsewhere. 
Furthermore, USC should consider reaching out to students who are no longer able to return to their universities in Puerto Rico. As part of its offer, NYU is accepting 50 English-proficient students in good academic standing for tuition-free semesters. According to a report by The New York Times, that group is a part of the 233,070 students at 58 colleges and universities on the island. 
If it were to join NYU in this effort, not only would USC uphold its image as welcoming a multicultural presence, but it would also benefit from the diverse perspectives that these populations bring to the campus. No matter where they come from, Puerto Rican students help expand the viewpoints of both their peers and their professors by exposing them to different cultures and beliefs. 
Given that the island is still suffering from extreme losses, USC has the moral obligation to reexamine its policies toward Puerto Ricans who have been directly affected by the hurricane — their educational futures may depend on the University’s help. Students are in desperate need of support, and the Trojan Family must welcome them with open arms.

So, here’s a sort of embarrassing confession: It wasn’t until the eighth grade that I realized Thanksgiving was only celebrated in the United States. I realize that should have been obvious — why would any other country or culture celebrate a holiday meant to commemorate the settlement of pilgrims and emergence of the first U.S. colonies? I’m not about to dole out excuses for my own ignorance, but I will say this: In America, we’re taught that the world revolves around us, around our culture, our values, our traditions. 
In my case, this prevalent, national egocentrism led me to believe families around the world congregated for a hearty meal of turkey and mashed potatoes just because I did. But among many of our right-leaning politicians, this egocentrism has had a different sort of effect: It’s produced inflated, often racially charged notions of moral superiority, and ignorance about the basics of cultural relativism that we should all be educated about.
Last week, an attorney representing Roy Moore, an Alabama Senate candidate who is accused of sexual misconduct with minors, told MSNBC host Ali Velshi that Velshi’s “background” should help him understand the concept of child marriage and parental consent for relationships. Velshi is of Indian descent and was born in Kenya, but raised in the United States. Moore’s attorney Trenton Garmon seemed to be suggesting that Moore’s relationships with underage teenage girls were totally acceptable, considering the arranged child marriages common in eastern cultures. As Velshi was visibly not white, Garmon took it upon himself to sweepingly cast him as a representative of Eastern culture.
It’s important to recognize that Garmon’s words come from a pervasive, systemic problem in right-wing politics. When conservative politicians are confronted about the abject harm of their policies and stances on American women — or, really, whenever they’re criticized for a moral failure that they can’t reasonably defend — suddenly, and only then, do human rights violations (real or imagined) in the Middle East, Africa, Asia or Latin America become relevant. 
Recall the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of a fallen American soldier, took the stage to criticize then-Republican nominee Donald Trump for his verbal attacks on Muslims. Trump then suggested that the reason only Khizr spoke, and not his wife, was that Ghazala had not been “allowed to have anything to say.” 
His response to the grieving parents of a Muslim American who had died for his country was to otherize them and suggest that Islam is inherently misogynistic — all while, himself, supporting policies that would allow the state to force American women to give birth, and just months before he would go on to threaten women accusing him of sexual assault. 
Ultimately, here is the inescapable truth: There are women’s rights abuses in every society. It seems the common thread that connects international civilizations is varying levels of disrespect for women’s rights.
A survey conducted by the European Commission in 2016 found 27 percent of European men think rape is excusable. And here in America, in conjunction with restrictions on abortion and rates of violence toward abortion providers and those seeking them, rates of maternal death have steadily been on the rise, particularly in states where abortion is more difficult to access. Human trafficking continues to exist across Europe and in the United States as well. 
In other countries, gruesome realities such as female genital mutilation, child marriage, sex slavery and severe limits on women’s access to education exist and should not be trivialized. But nor should they be used as a shield by Western politicians who have their own gruesome, inhumane beliefs about women’s human rights. 
Notably, this summer, two Muslim women wrote an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing female Democratic senators like Sen. Kamala Harris for not asking them questions in a Senate hearing about the “dangers” of “political Islam.” They made an important point that Western feminists and progressives can sometimes have blind spots for the different experiences of women of color, and yet, Harris and her peers didn’t refuse to question activists Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Asra Q. Nomani because they don’t support their rights — but because they do. Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee invited Ali, a survivor of female genital mutilation, child marriage and a host of other abuses, and Nomani, who had been shunned by her society for having a child out of marriage, solely to stigmatize Islam and draw more support for Trump’s travel ban. 
The takeaway here is not that women like Nomani and Ali should be silenced, nor that the tragic human rights abuses and misogyny of non-Western societies should be dismissed. Rather, it’s that every society in the world has work to do when it comes to women’s rights. Demonizing non-western societies or using the human rights abuses of other countries to somehow make those happening in America seem less awful is not only counterproductive, but also deeply deceitful.
