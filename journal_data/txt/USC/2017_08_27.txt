After beginning last week with six Trojans in New York City for the US Open, the field is now whittled down to one. All four former USC men’s tennis players who entered the qualifying rounds failed to advance to the tournament’s main draw, and Robert Farah withdrew due to injury, leaving Steve Johnson as the only Trojan representative in Flushing Meadows.
Farah, the No. 26 doubles player in the world, will not compete at the US Open this year, as he continues his rehab in hopes of competing for Team Colombia at the Davis Cup in September.
Daniel Nguyen and Roberto Quiroz — who were both with Johnson during the Trojans’ 2012 national title run — fell in the first round of US Open qualifying, but former teammates Ray Sarmiento and Yannick Hanfmann advanced to the second. They needed two more wins to secure a spot in the bracket alongside the world’s best.
Unfortunately for Sarmiento, he was matched up against Grand Slam veteran Tim Smyczek. Smyczek has advanced to the US Open main draw for the last five years, and he knocked out Sarmiento in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3, behind six aces and five break-point wins. Sarmiento battled, even breaking Smyczek in one game, but he had four double faults and won only 36 percent of points when his opponent was serving.
After besting Sarmiento, Smyczek played his way into his sixth consecutive main-draw berth with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Peter Polansky.
Hanfmann also fell in his second-round qualifier, though his match against Vaclav Safranek stretched to three sets. Hanfmann actually took the first set 6-2 before his opponent rallied to take the next two 6-4, 7-5, and he was sent packing despite winning 104 total points — Safranek won 99 — and serving up 12 aces to Safranek’s one. Perhaps most tellingly, Safranek took two-thirds of his break points. Though Hanfmann matched his opponent’s tally of six, he failed to capitalize on another nine break-point opportunities.
Safranek also advanced to the main draw, beating Sergiy Stakhovsky in three sets in the third qualifying round.
Johnson, the only Trojan left standing, now looks forward to Monday, when the US Open officially begins. Johnson — ranked No. 46 worldwide in singles — is in both the singles and doubles brackets: He will face world No. 92 Nicolas Almagro on his own before teaming up with Tommy Paul in doubles to take on Fabio Fognini and Simone Bolelli.
 Johnson is scheduled to play his first singles match at 11 a.m. on Monday. The schedule for doubles play was not released as of Sunday afternoon.

Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
The USC women’s volleyball team finished strong in the USC/LMU Tournament this past weekend with a 3-0 record to open the season, defeating LMU, Michigan and Albany.
On Friday, the Trojans began their season at Loyola Marymount and prevailed 3-1 (23-25, 25-21, 25-14, 25-11). Many of the new Trojans saw playing time in this match, most notably sophomore setter Cindy Marina, who transferred to USC this season from Duke. Marina had 22 assists that match, and she split the duties with senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley, who had 19 assists.  
The Trojan offense was strong and balanced with sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier putting down 13 kills, junior outside hitter Alyse Ford adding 11 kills and senior middle blocker Danielle Geiger adding 8 kills on a .727 hitting percentage with no errors. As a team, the Trojans hit .400 with contributions from senior opposite hitters Nikki Withers and Brittany Abercrombie and senior middle blocker Brittany Welsh. They collectively had 18 kills in the match.
The Trojan defense did their job against LMU, holding them to an .098 hitting percentage. Geiger and Abercrombie both helped establish this feat with five blocks each; Welsh added four blocks, Withers three and Ford two. Behind the block, junior libero Victoria Garrick had five digs and sophomore defensive specialist Jenna Adams added five more. 
Following their season opener, the Trojans returned to the Galen Center to take on No. 16 Michigan for the first time in program history. With several Trojans earning double-doubles in the match, the Trojans were able to defeat the ranked opponent (25-22, 25-19, 28-30, 25-16), which should earn them a ranking in the next AVCA rankings poll.
Marina had 19 assists and 10 digs, which was her first career double-double. Lanier also played for her 17th double-double, logging 19 kills and 12 digs. Ford was one dig shy of a double-double performance, but she finished the match with 15 kills and 9 digs. Garrick added 17 digs and 3 service aces.
The Trojans’ Saturday match against the University of Albany also went to four sets (25-16, 23-25, 25-21, 25-18). The second set against the Great Danes was played without usual starters Lanier, Welsh and Garrick.
Withers was the offensive leader for the Trojans hitting on a .474 hitting percentage with 11 kills; she also had three digs and two blocks in the match. Also adding to the Trojans’ offense was Abercrombie, who had 12 kills on a .435 hitting percentage. Lanier also swung for 16 kills on a .364 percentage and Ford had 12 kills on a .320 hitting percentage. Meyer-Whalley and Marina guided this offense with 25 and 22 assists, respectively.
This win against Albany gave the Trojans their first three-match win streak since October 2016. The Trojans will strive to build on this momentum as they have tournaments the next few weeks on the road. Next weekend, they will face ranked opponents at the Blue Jay Invitational in Omaha, Neb.: No. 9 Creighton and No. 14 Kentucky.
 
Developing a bad habit of losing the 2nd set in all three matches. Didn’t realize missing Lanier in 2nd set vs. Albany,
but still no excuse for the loss. Not a good freshman class this year where one top player needed on the outside to
make this a top team.

On Saturday night, the sports world watched as Floyd Mayweather beat Conor McGregor in one of the most highly anticipated boxing matches in history, one that is expected to shatter pay-per-view records. We marveled at how McGregor, an MMA fighter making his pro boxing debut, hung tough against one of the all-time greats, and we oohed and aahed in the middle rounds as Mayweather landed punch after punch on a finally fatigued McGregor, forcing the referee to call the fight in the 10th round.
I’ll bet you this: Not once during the fight did it cross your mind that Mayweather has a criminal history. He was cited at least seven times for assault against five women — according to Deadspin — pleading guilty twice to domestic violence and serving 60 days in prison in 2012.
It didn’t cross my mind. As my friends and I gathered around my phone watching the fight, I was just glad that Periscope streamers were saving me the $100 in pay-per-view costs and that I was witnessing a momentous sporting occasion. To me, the competition and significance of the match was enough to overlook — no, straight-up ignore — Mayweather’s checkered past. By no means was this an endorsement of Mayweather. I despise the man, but not enough to turn away from the spectacle.
All of this leads to an essential question when it comes to sports: Where is the line that professional athletes must cross before they are shunned entirely from their sport, before society deems their actions intolerable and their peers cast them aside as pariahs?
Domestic violence seems to be forgivable; we’ve overlooked athlete after athlete across various sports. The NFL let Michael Vick back in the league after he participated in dogfighting, and it gave Leonard Little a second chance after he killed a woman in a drunk-driving incident. Mike Tyson — a convicted rapist — was allowed back in the ring and his first fight back in 1995 broke pay-per-view records at the time and then we loved him when he made a cameo in The Hangover.
Clearly, we are willing to overlook at a lot of things if the entertainment payoff is worth it. Outside of the ring, Tyson is a convicted criminal; inside it, he was a dominant boxer. On the football field, Vick didn’t have the “dogfighting” stigma attached to his jersey; he was simply just another quarterback.
To some, money and success trump morality and ethics. Tyson filled plenty of pockets with every fight he took on — period. Vick was a skilled quarterback and helped teams win football games — period. If they both also happened to be bad human beings, so be it. And there’s always the argument of giving people a second chance.
But if we are to forgive the Mayweathers and Tysons and Vicks of the world, then we need to take a long, hard look at one current football player and ask why we aren’t treating him the same. It is weeks before the NFL season kicks off, and Colin Kaepernick is still unemployed.
Kaepernick, as is widely known by now, caused an uproar last season when he knelt during the national anthem before games in a sign of protest for civil rights and against police brutality. He created a divisive firestorm: Some of his peers knelt with him in solidarity, while others called him out for being unpatriotic for disrespecting his country’s flag.
It’s fine to disagree on his actions. It’s not fine, however, to use his actions as a reason to blackball him from the league, which is what the 32 NFL owners have been doing all offseason, whether they admit it or not.
Let’s set aside the argument that Kaepernick doesn’t have a job because he’s not good enough. He isn’t Tom Brady, but Kaepernick is far and away a better quarterback than Austin Davis, Blaine Gabbert, Thad Lewis and David Fales — just four of the many free agent passers who have landed jobs this offseason. Remember: Kaepernick is still 29, just a season removed from starting for the San Francisco 49ers, four years removed from leading his team to the NFC Championship Game and five years removed from being one play shy of winning a Super Bowl for the 49ers. And you’re telling me you’d rather have NFL journeymen like Thad Lewis on your team?
Point is: Kaepernick doesn’t have a job because owners don’t feel comfortable with the backlash and distraction that would come with signing him. They fear that fans would stop showing up, afraid that by signing Kaepernick, they would alienate the very people they need to fill their stadium and keep the cash flowing.
The issue here is that Kaepernick has injected politics into sports in a very forceful and public manner, and I don’t think society is quite ready for that yet. Michael Jordan, who famously avoided controversial statements during his playing days, reportedly once said, “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” Giving an athlete with a criminal record a second chance is, in most cases, a black-and-white issue. Prison time isn’t political. But Kaepernick’s quandary is more nuanced. Sure, some sports fans think that athletes should use their platform to advocate for what they believe in, but there are many others who don’t, especially if they don’t agree with Kaepernick’s position.
It’s an unfortunate situation — embarrassing, even. Vick encouraged animal cruelty and the NFL welcomed him back. In more recent examples, Adrian Peterson pled guilty to charges of child abuse after beating his 4-year-old son with a tree branch and is still in the league. Joe Mixon was drafted in the second round this year despite assaulting a woman in a bar in college, an incident that was caught on camera.
Yet, Kaepernick, who simply exercised his First Amendment rights — breaking zero laws or NFL rules in the process — has been shunned from his sport, blackballed and cast aside. It’s clear that we haven’t reached the point where we can truly accept athletes for who they are as people, not just pawns who run around throwing and catching footballs.
Until then, by cheering for women beaters such as Floyd Mayweather but castigating Colin Kaepernick, we are nothing but hypocrites. And that’s a shame.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Earlier this month, the organizers of a white supremacist rally at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville aimed to spark a national dialogue about the perceived oppression of the contemporary heterosexual, white male. But their march seems to have spurred another debate — one about free speech and whether the First Amendment protects hate speech. 
The question is certainly being asked and hotly debated at universities across the country. In the wake of the Charlottesville rallies that killed one anti-racism protester and resulted in numerous injuries and violent confrontations, Texas A&M University and, more recently, the University of Florida denied requests for Richard Spencer, a self-identified leader of the “alt-right” movement who has called for ethnic cleansing, to speak on their campuses. But UC Berkeley is preparing for a week in which both conservative pundits Milo Yiannopoulos, who has likened black people to apes and feminists to Nazis, and Ann Coulter, who has argued against women’s voting rights, will both be speaking per the invitation of the school’s conservative newspaper, The Berkeley Patriot.
The issue of free speech has been widely discussed on college campuses since the Vietnam War era. Since then, young people have been at the forefront of peaceful protests and political expression. But today’s dialogue on college campuses tends to be laced with misinformation and ignorance about Supreme Court cases and constitutional laws that define free speech. Notably, one thing many self-identified free speech advocates who are quick to take up arms at the first challenge to a provocative speaker seem to forget is that the First Amendment guarantees freedom from censorship — it does not guarantee a platform to spew hate.
The First Amendment guarantees that Yiannopoulos or Coulter could speak their minds in a public place; it does not guarantee them a stage and an audience at a university. In the same way, the federal government and public schools cannot censor nonviolent statements, but simultaneously owe no obligation to stream individuals on Facebook Live or bring them to speak before the White House lawn. Refusal to offer this platform is not a violation of someone’s First Amendment rights. Newspapers have no obligation to publish op-eds or letters to the editor that they are disinclined to for whatever reason, and the federal government cannot censor newspapers.
And in the same vein, Twitter and many other websites, social media platforms and hosting servers are private domains and it is fully up to their discretion how hate speech and harassment are dealt with. The First Amendment delineates the obligations of government institutions; these same obligations are not shared by private companies. 
Google had the right to terminate an employee whose speech directly targeted a demographic of employees and established a hostile workplace environment earlier this month. The argument that a private company violated the First Amendment is a moot one, and the argument that individuals can say and do anything in their places of work without consequences is the same argument that justifies — and even encourages — sexual harassment and bullying.
Circling back to college campuses, UC Berkeley has been the epicenter of the campus free speech debate since a violent riot predominantly led by anarchists unaffiliated with the school unfolded when Yiannopoulos last tried to speak earlier this year. But it’s important to note that students who protest speaking appearances by the far-right are not violating anyone’s free speech rights either. If anything, young people who protest provocative speakers are simply putting their own free speech rights to use, and learning important lessons about speaking their minds and fighting for their convictions. 
In either case, it’s often not universities but campus organizations that are inviting controversial speakers. And if universities deny the appearances of these speakers, more often than not this is out of safety concerns rather than malicious attempts at censorship. Doing so is certainly not a violation of anyone’s rights. 
The free speech debate can seem polarizing on college campuses, where people who have never been the subject of racial hatred and stereotyping, nor of sexual harassment and bullying, argue that individuals should be allowed to say anything without consequences, and people who suffer from this ambivalence toward racism argue the opposite. 
Still, there is one bipartisan line of thought, which suggests that speech that is simply advocating contrarian ideals — that women are biologically inferior to men as intellectuals, that African Americans are biologically inferior to white people — but isn’t overtly violent, ought to be respected and even given a platform. This suggests that any comments, as long as they’re short of directly calling for violence, are protected. 
However, this should raise the question of how taking away women’s right to vote or be in the workplace, or removing minorities from the country and implementing ethnic cleansing — the concepts demanded by much of the speech of the “alt-right” — could be done without violence or the threat of it. And welcoming these ideas on campus may not celebrate or glorify hatred, but doing so certainly contributes to normalizing it. In the same vein, equating this hate speech to “left-wing extremism” — the alt-right’s term for calls to respect the pronouns of trans people and establish a national health care system — is a ploy to equate a vocal movement for equality to a vocal movement for inequality.
Too often in the  campus dialogue around free speech are the most direct stakeholders marginalized. In society today, individuals of marginalized demographics are intimidated and pressured into silence when high-profile speakers come to preach about white supremacy and patriarchy. Their voices are excluded from a media narrative told by majority white reporters, and their experiences are undeniably being overlooked by a U.S. Congress that is 80 percent white, 80 percent male and 92 percent Christian. 
The exclusion of minorities and marginalized Americans from our collective national dialogue remains a troubling issue in itself. But all of this is sidelined in a current free speech dialogue dominated by white men who feel victimized by being discouraged from saying the “N-word.”
I can tell that the writer has not read the classic texts on this matter, such as Thomas Paine’s introduction to the Age of Reason, John Milton’s Areopagitica and John Mills essay “On Liberty” where it is variously said, but I’ll attempt to summarize for the writer of this article. What they say is, it’s not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear. And every time you silence somebody, you make yourself a prisoner of your own action, because you deny yourself the right to hear something.
In other words, your own right to hear and be exposed is as much involved in all these cases as is the right of the other to voice his or her view. Indeed as John Stuart Mill said, if all in society were agreed on the truth and beauty and value of one proposition, all except one person, it would be most important — in fact, it would become even more important — that that one heretic be heard, because we would still benefit from his perhaps outrageous or appalling view.
The idea speech causes violence is indeed a testy one. . The whole premise of the article that “hate speech has no right to a platform, though people have the right to say it” is in part true and in part false. But the writer hides behind its ambiguity. If a university such as UC Berkely, which is a public institution, thus is “public” in the sense that all rights apply to those who attend. UC Berkely is not a private institution such as google or twitter, thus a person’s right to free speech is in the most absolute sense protected regardless of its content or some arbitrary measure of “this speech is bad or this speech is good.” Never mind the impossibility of finding an individual or body to assume the omnipotent role of knowing when my speech has gone too far, where is the limit, what will be the reaction, who can dictate what I can read or hear or read? Just for the sake of this comment, I would not give that job to the writer of this article. And anyone who thinks himself not up to the challenge to decide for themselves what they can read or hear shall not push that agenda on me.
As to denying a platform, Abraham Lincoln once said “So I would not be the no slave, So I would not be the master.” Such as all individuals should claim the right to not be censored or denied platform, we should also not be the censor or the one to deny them. In other words when I am offended by ideas like that if I don’t believe in the virgin birth I am going to Hell, I claim the right to be offended, but I don’t go around using a hecklers veto on speakers or burn down/destroy statues of the virgin Mary or churches, I’m too decent for that. And those who advocate violence or physical reprisal in response to the speech they find offense in is contemptible.  
Perhaps one of the most profound statements on freedom of speech comes from Justice Holmes who said that speech may be limited when edified as an action like shouting fire in a crowded theater. Some context to one of the stupidest statements ever made from the bench is an order. What Holmes was doing in that case was sending to life imprisonment a group of Yiddish speaking Socialists who published a pamphlet in New York opposing Mr. Wilson’s involvement in the First World War, in other words no matter how high minded or the “moral intent” of what the writer suggests what you end with is exactly that. A group of Yiddish socialists being imprisoned on a major question of the day. Bear in mind that every time you violate or propose to violate the free speech of someone else, in potencia, you’re making a rod for own back. And finally, the question utterly dodged by the writer in her shady article when calling speech hateful and accusing speech of being violent: who’s going to decide?
To whom do you award the right to decide which speech is harmful or who is the harmful speaker? Or determine in advance what are the harmful consequences going to be, that we know enough about in advance to prevent? To whom would you give this job? To whom are you going to award the job of being the censor? Isn’t it a famous old story that the man who has to read all the pornography, in order to decide what’s fit to be passed and what’s fit not to be, is the man most likely to be debauched? Does anyone know anyone to whom you’d give this job? Does anyone have a nominee? I can tell you right now that there is no one good enough to decide what I can read or hear. But the writer is inferring there must be such a person. Or is counting on authority like the government or the school to do so. Well, the hell with that assertion then. It’s inviting us to be liars and hypocrites and to deny what we evidently know already.  And that is it may not be determined in advance what words are apt or inapt. No one has the knowledge that would be required to make that call. And, more to the point, one has to suspect the motives of those who do so. In particular, the motives of those who are determined to be offended, like those now calling for the change of name of the USC mascot because he bears the same sounding name as Robert E. Lee’s horse. (our Traveler has one L, Lee’s Traveller had two)
Tyler, an outstanding essay. Well reasoned and beautifully written. I hope that time finds you in the USC School of Law one day.
let’s put people in jail who say words that others “claim’ are offensive.  but only the words that liberals claim are offensive.  still ok to say honkie or cracker but no sp–, nig—, or r– hea-.
this will totally empower the losers, like the fat stupid she-blobs on our campuses.  we don’t need no stinkin supreme court, we can let the fat shebeasts decide what is proper.
Well put! That is an interesting argument I have not heard among the clamor between left and right. It suggests that a government, Federal, state or local, is not obliged to provide a speaking place. OK. That said, public speaking places, like parks, town squares, public schools and especially streets and so on, already exist. So should any group be permitted to use them without a permit? Or be barred because of presumed content of hatred and the need for violence? Or parade without a permit? 
The Nazi, Klan, white supremacy racist marchers, yes, pour out vile hate. Yet how does a government deny them the right to disgorge their disgusting vitriol? I wish I knew. The German government has passed laws prohibiting Nazi outpourings, symbolism, displays, Heil Hitler salutes, and so on – praise them – but they are not bound by the First Amendment.
Law students? Do you have any legal points to make that clarify this matter beyond quoting the First Amendment?

Fifth Harmony released its eponymous third album on Friday — the girls’ first LP as a quartet since the departure of Camila Cabello in December 2016. 
And though Fifth Harmony now has four members, the self-titled album has proven to be its best yet. The songs feature all members equally, a quality that past albums often lacked. For example, in its hit “Worth It,” Lauren Jauregui lacked a solo and was overpowered by Cabello and Dinah Jane Hansen. Fifth Harmony’s debut  Reflection was criticized by fans for excluding Ally Brooke Hernandez and giving the most solos to Cabello.
The album opens with lead single “Down,” featuring rapper Gucci Mane, which starts the album with an already more laid back, chill energy compared to Reflection and 7/27. Though “Down” is not lyrically refined, its production and edgy music video prove that Hernandez, Normani Kordei, Hansen and Jauregui have blossomed into strong, confident women. The song’s beat seems like an upgrade from “Work From Home,” its lead single from 7/27. 
The same day the album released, the group dropped its second single “He Like That” along with its music video. “He Like That” is the sexiest and fiercest yet, featuring upbeat acoustics and an even vocal distribution by all four members. 
“Angel,” the album’s eighth track, was produced and written by electronic artists Poo Bear and Skrillex. The song showcased Fifth Harmony’s newfound musical versatility, something that wasn’t as evident in the group’s early discography.  In “Angel,” Hernandez raps, “Track star, think you’re running these streets / You ain’t the only one running the streets” — the first time the group has rapped, aside from Kordei’s verse in “That’s My Girl” from 7/27.
In its third release, the members began to experiment with songwriting, something they had asked their record label for, since Fifth Harmony’s inception. The songs they wrote uncover layers of both vulnerability and sass. Specifically, on “Make You Mad,” they emphasize their worth with sentiments of empowerment: “I’m gonna make you miss me / I’m gonna make you go mad / I’m gonna make sure I’m the best you ever had.”  
Fifth Harmony has cited Beyoncé as one of its biggest influences, an admiration that is revealed in “Deliver,” a track with powerful beats and a fiery opening reminiscent of Queen B herself. 
The album ends with a beautiful, powerful message on “Bridges,” a song that counters President Donald Trump’s plans to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. The lyrics, “We build bridges. No, we won’t separate. We know love can conquer hate, so we build bridges. Bridges, not walls,” demonstrate the girls’ desire to create unity and love amid the current political climate prevalent in the United States. “Bridges” blends elements of beautiful, choir-like harmonies with enticing solos that reiterate the song’s unifying message. 
Fifth Harmony has evolved from the cute girl group of five that made its debut by coming in third on the second season of The X-Factor. Now, the four women of color are making their mark on the music industry, and their bond as a quartet is seemingly unbreakable. Fifth Harmony’s new musical style and onstage presence provide insight on their connectedness and strength, something that was not clear before Cabello’s absence.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
From the moment I stepped foot onto this red-bricked campus, I carried on my shoulders the weight of various burdens and promises to my parents, sealed shut since I signed my statement of intent to attend USC. 
I knew that in committing to four years at USC, I had resigned myself to a debilitating mountain of student debt and the task of maintaining a high enough GPA to fund my scholarships. I also held the expectations of either attending law school or pursuing a graduate degree in the future. 
Parental expectations marginally exist in college — the weeks fly by, and for me, daily calls turned into weekly calls and a few  text messages sent in-between. I don’t mind, but the semblance of guilt and childish desire for praise strikes me every time I consider sharing with my parents my overpacked schedule that screams, “I’m tanking my GPA, but at least my resume is recruiter-worthy!” 
I am a hopeless overachiever, and this column is somewhat of a privileged preface to my academic and emotional decline, which I can never explicitly share to my parents. I never believed in the sophomore slump until I found myself apartment-hopping, desperately trying to escape my roach-infested kitchen, scrambling to find writers to pick up news stories and enduring a non-stop eight-hour class schedule three days a week so I can intern at a publication beyond my wildest dreams. 
It’s hard to explain this to my parents who believe academic success reflects professional success. In fact, I am anything but an overachiever to them; in their eyes, extracurriculars and internships are important but not necessary.
The undeniable pressure that many students feel here to succeed, not only academically but also professionally, is mentally debilitating, and I, the once-confident overachieving freshman, have fallen prey to that. There are individuals out there who are arguably in worse situations than me, but looking back at my freshman year, I only wish to relive it.
There’s always the calm before a storm — the uneasy feeling of peaceful tranquility you deserve before the whirlwind of stress, emotions and academics unexpectedly hit you. I guess I’m currently living in the calm; I’m constantly on-edge, not only about academics but also on my extracurriculars and the terrible housing situation I’m trying to resolve. I constantly feel isolated from my close group of friends, and I rely too much on sleeping on my boyfriend’s twin XL mattress to escape sleeping alone. After this summer, I also realized I am incapable of doing my own laundry without the assistance of said boyfriend, so I guess the summer before sophomore year did not result in enough personal growth on my behalf.
I know, I know. It’s only been the first week of school and I’ve painted a terrible premonition of the upcoming semester in a non-poetic manner, but I actually am quite excited for another year’s journey of metaphorical ups and downs. 
The funny thing about living a sporadic college lifestyle is you never know where it’s going to take you, and currently, the sophomore slump has taken me to the, “I want to lay here and never get up” destination of my life. 
 
So melodramatic.  Suck it up. It won’t get any easier.  Worse case scenario, you’ll become a writer.
Terry, that may be not “Sophomore Slump,” but just plain depression. Go to the Campus Clinic or to your own health provider and describe how you feel. Depression typically is the result of several factors, but quite often, it is mainly a chemical imbalance. The Campus Doctor may prescribe a course of antidepressents that will quickly restore your happy morale. Antidepressants do not “dope you up,” and cannot make you feel high. They merely correct the chemical imbalance in your body.

As the fall semester kicks off, Tommy Bot, the University’s first campus chatbot, is updated and ready for use by the USC community.
Developed by sophomores Mimi Tran Zambetti and Justin He, alongside juniors Samuel Breck and Will Durkee, Tommy Bot’s beta version was launched in Spring 2017 as a project in LavaLab, a startup incubator at USC.
The team behind Tommy Bot was inspired to look at common issues facing students, and wanted to create solutions for those not familiar with the campus or college life. 
“Pretty early on in our years we were trying to figure out what’s a problem, what’s a pain point that a lot of students felt coming into college,” Tran Zambetti said. “[They’re] really easy questions you can answer, but for some reason the information’s kind of harder to find through your browser. If you can aggregate it, you can make it really easy to access just by texting someone.”
From there, Tommy Bot was created. The user-friendly interface is accessible on Facebook Messenger, and the bot engages the user in a simulated conversation to help them find a location, an event or the hours that a building is open. 
“Since we initially started Tommy Bot, we gained a significant amount of users,” said Breck, one of the bot’s programmers. “Now that we’re getting larger, we have to consider the volume of users that we’re getting, we certainly need to scale our project [so it can handle more users] and just hold it up to a higher standard for a larger audience.”
According to He, Tommy Bot currently receives 500 to 600 uses a day, but the number of total users is higher, at around 1,000. Additionally, Tommy Bot’s Facebook page has 377 likes and counting.
Since the summer, the team has expanded Tommy Bot’s areas of expertise to include the Village and its vendors, alongside their hours and services. This week, the team hopes to roll out club searches and additional events. 
The artificial intelligence, He said, will also be more refined and easy to use in comparison to their beta mode last semester. 
The bot now also features on-campus events, and the team is working to integrate Facebook events that occur at and around USC onto the platform. 
The team also hopes to integrate a club directory to help users find organizations according to their interests.
Tommy Bot received a $10,000 grant through the Iovine and Young Academy Prize in April.
To win the prize, contestants pitched their ideas to a panel of industry experts who weighed in and ranked the most innovative ideas.
“At the end of the competition, a lot of the teams had been awarded some form of money, but we ended up getting the $10,000 prize,” Tran Zambetti said. “Dean [Erica] Muhl  was telling us about how $10,000 would push Tommy Bot a lot farther than it could for any of the other projects that had been pitched. They’d been impressed by the users and the retention rates we’d gotten.” 
With money and support from the university, the team behind Tommy Bot has been able to work closer with USC to get more detailed information to provide the most accurate answers possible. This collaboration has helped them to find ways to increase user retention rates.
The Tommy Bot creators have also invested in virtual marketing this past summer, specifically targeting freshmen, to expand their user base. 
“Most chatbots in the nation have struggled with keeping their users because a lot visit chatbots, message it once or twice and never use it again,” He said. “We’re working towards finding use cases — functions and features students will use on a day-to-day basis — so users keep coming back.”

Over the summer, two USC students launched a start-up meal kit service called Nom Noms, with the purpose of reducing food waste.
Madison Eckert, a senior majoring in political science, and Andrew Ullmann, a recent graduate, founded the meal kit company on the tenets of affordability and sustainability. 
“It’s a combination of a company called Imperfect Produce, which takes ugly fruits and vegetables and sells it at a discounted rate, and Blue Apron,” Eckert said. “Essentially we’re providing really delicious and healthy meal kits that are professional-level recipes that can be made in about 20 to 30 minutes, but at a price point that’s actually reasonable for students and for young professionals or for low-income families.”
The meal kits sell for $4.99 a serving, which, according to Eckert, is about half the price of most other meal kits in the industry. 
In addition to being reasonably priced, the meal kits are net positive for the environment due to their use of imperfect produce, Ullmann said.
“We take as much as we can … from imperfect and overstocked produce,” Ullmann said. “Instead of throwing [imperfect produce] away, they give them to us. They’re brand new, fresh, usually organic and we’re able to use those in our meal kits.” 
In addition to its affordability, the packaging of the meal kits is completely compostable, and Eckert and Ullmann encourage customers to directly return their packaging. 
Eckert said the two started off their venture with the idea of providing meals to students after restaurants had closed, using their surplus ingredients from that day. Originally, they planned to pick up leftover food at the end of a business day from local vendors and sell them to students for half the price. However, their business model changed after they spoke with a professor.
“I had a conversation with one of my professors who asked me, ‘If you’re all about reducing food waste, is it really beneficial to the world to just be saving five sandwiches or is it to be saving 15,000 tons of food from just one supplier alone?’” Eckert said. 
After receiving that advice, Ullmann made a call to Amy’s Kitchen, and the two were shocked when the kitchen called back right away with an interest in working together. 
Currently, Eckert and Ullmann are working on expanding the company, which is serving the USC community currently.
“Right now we’re figuring out how to work with distributors, farmers and nonprofits to take out as much food waste as we possibly can and get it in the hands of students, young professionals and low-income families,” Eckert said. 
Their current plan is to expand to UCLA and Loyola Marymount University by the end of the calendar year and then move on to San Francisco, followed by the entire West Coast, and begin business on the East Coast next year. 
“It’s a lot to do, but we’re pretty confident about it, and most of that is because the distributors are really happy to work with us,” Ullmann said.
Nom Noms is trying to expand into food deserts in an effort to increase the kit’s accessibility. 
Although Eckert and Ullmann agree that they’ve experienced many easy successes, their biggest challenge has been managing the company by themselves. The two actually work hands-on to pack the meal kits themselves and are in the process of finding investors.
“It’s just the normal issues of a growing start up that doesn’t necessarily have the capital to do what we need to do,” Eckert said.
Eckert and Ullmann said they have received an overwhelmingly positive response from everyone they have talked to about the company and are confident it will succeed. 
“We’re only at USC right now, mostly because we don’t have the capacity personally to expand quite yet,” Eckert said. 
Ullmann and Eckert are optimistic about the future of the company, especially since they are crafting meal kits for their own demographic and are able to understand the needs and wants of their target customers. 
“I don’t think I’ve met a person yet who’s doubtful that this is going to succeed — it’s just a matter of doing it,” Eckert said.
