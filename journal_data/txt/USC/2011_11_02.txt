USC provides a variety of group exercise classes, which are imperative to staying fit in college, according to a new study.

The top motivator for college students to work out is having educated professionals at their universities’ fitness centers to teach group classes such as yoga, aerobics and Zumba, according to an American College of Sports Medicine survey of the top fitness trends for 2012 published in the November issue of Health & Fitness Journal.
Leora Mitzner, a student teacher and yoga instructor at the Lyon Center, said it is easier for students to commit to a weekly group exercise class than to work out alone.
“When students attend a group class, it becomes part of their schedule like their academic classes, and so they’re much less likely to skip out when school gets stressful,” Mitzner said. “Although the attendance for my classes still dwindles around midterms, I’ve found that the few who stay committed have the best experience at these times. One student told me that my morning yoga class was the one thing that got him through the day.”
Melissa Rocque, a senior majoring in international relations (global business), said she has been attending spin, yoga and Pilates classes regularly since she was a freshman.
“It’s more motivating when you’re in a group of people because it increases the competitive drive,” Rocque said. “If I’m spinning by myself it’s easy to slack off, but it’s much more motivating when you see a group of people working hard around you.”
She said this keeps her motivated to go to the gym during midterms.
“As a student, you get busy as classes and activities happen,” Rocque said. “It’s really nice to have your workout be a kind of social thing when you have all those other things going on.”
Sarah Francis, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies and public health, said blocking out specific times to work out and having motivating instructors makes group workouts useful.
“You’re guaranteed to work out for a certain amount of time, whether it’s 45 minutes or an hour, so it makes you work out longer than if you just came on your own,” Francis said. “It’s a better workout because you have instructors pushing you; it’s a longer workout and it’s more fun because you can bring friends and make it more social.”
Some students, however, said they prefer to work out by themselves. Chris Zao, a graduate student studying computer science engineering, said he only has time to work out late in the day.
“I work out at 11 p.m., when there are no group classes being held at the Lyon Center,” Zao said. “Because of my busy schedule as a graduate student, working out at night four times a week is the only time I get.”
Daniel Heller, a yoga teacher at Lyon Center and USC web services staff member, said students do not have to neglect their bodies if they do not have time to work out.
“Study and meditation over a prolonged period of time are what yoga was invented for,” Heller said. “I’d tell busy students to try holding simple or restorative yoga poses while studying, if you aren’t too self-conscious or confined to a library.”
Certain poses might also help students stay awake, Heller said.
“If you’re exhausted and have to finish a reading assignment, lie down on your back with legs vertical and feet flexed, holding your book above your eyes,” Heller said. “You can’t fall asleep without dropping a book on your head, and after a few minutes you and all your abdominals will be awake.”

The newly elected interim prime minister of Libya, Abdurrahim El-Keib, received his master’s degree in electrical engineering from USC Viterbi School of Engineering in 1976.
Keib was elected as prime minister Monday by the National Transitional Council, the de facto governing body of Libya, with a vote of 26 to 25.
After earning his master’s degree, Kieb went on to earn his doctorate from North Carolina State University in 1984.
After briefly teaching at the University of Tripoli, Keib was exiled by former Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi and fled to the United States, where he still holds citizenship.
Keib taught electrical engineering at the University of Alabama and then moved to United Arab Emirates, where he chaired the electrical engineering department at the Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi.
When the uprising against Gaddafi began in February, Keib returned to Tripoli where he helped fund and organize the rebel forces. Keib was selected to represent the capital city of Tripoli for the NTC.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, said he is proud of Keib and hopes his experience at USC helps guide him in his new position.
“As Libya enters a new promising chapter in its history, we wish him the best in restoring democracy and bringing a bright future for the Libyan people,” Yortsos said in a statement. “We are hopeful that the Trojan spirit and values will guide him in the difficult but exciting path of national rebuilding.”
Keib has received criticism from political opponents for living a luxurious life during his time in exile in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, while Libyans suffered under the rule of Gaddafi.
Keib will remain in power until democratic elections are held in Libya within the next eight months, according to the NTC.
Along with unifying Libya, Keib is facing increased pressure from human rights group to take action against the NTC rebel forces accused of committing inhumane crimes.
Hopefully he enjoys more success than the Japanese PM who had a USC degree.  (But he was just one of many recent Japanese PMs who’ve been forced to resign.)
lol expect Libya to be in total poverty now that it is ruled by a US puppet.. ahahahah

Students looking for nutritional information around USC are often unable to find sodium content, which is especially problematic as many Americans already have too much in their diets.
Overdose · Many restaurants on campus, including those at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, do not display the amount of sodium in their food on their menus. - Rachel Bracker | Daily Trojan
Nearly 60 percent of Americans do not know how much sodium they consume each day and 88.2 percent of those who are not at risk for sodium-related health issues exceed the Food and Drug Administration’s recommended daily sodium intake of 2,300 mg, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
USC Hospitality does not have nutritional information available for a majority of its University Park Campus dining locations. According to its website, the information was scheduled to be available in spring 2011, but it is still unavailable.
It can be difficult for students eating on campus to stay under the recommended limit.
Some food items available at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, like the “Classic Burrito” with chicken from Wahoo’s Fish Tacos, are under the FDA approved mark with 1695 mg of sodium. Other options like the “Western Bacon Six Dollar Burger” from Carl’s Jr. contains 2440 mg of sodium. If one adds a medium-sized order of “Natural-Cut French Fries” and an “Oreo Cookie Hand-Scooped Ice Cream Shake,” the overall sodium intake of the meal increases to 3680 mg.
Vito Campese, professor of medicine and chief of the Keck School of Medicine Division of Nephrology, said students should be wary of fast food.
“Fast food is rich in salt and other spices to give it a better taste,” Campese said. “Since cheap food is less tasty, companies add salt to make it more acceptable to consumers.”
People with sodium-heavy diets are prone to heart problems, according to the FDA.
“The most obvious effect of high sodium is high blood pressure,” Campese said. “Studies have also found a link between high sodium and cardiomegaly, or the enlargement of the heart. In the long run, this may coincide with kidney problems.”
Though many places, such as The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, display the calories of their items, few have the full nutritional information available on site. Other eateries, like Trojan Grounds, display the calorie amounts for their beverages, but leave muffins, bagels, scones and croissants unmarked.
Hannah Getts, a sophomore majoring in critical studies, said visible nutritional labels would change her eating habits.
“Seeing something or reading something relating to sodium on a label would make me think about my sodium intake before eating,” Getts said. “Otherwise I won’t think about it.”
Marco Guillen, assistant kitchen manager at Everybody’s Kitchen, said EVK does what it can to keep options open for students who are looking to limit their sodium intake. He said some items, like the tri-tip, tend to have higher sodium levels and should be eaten in moderation.
“Steamed vegetables are good for students who don’t want too much salt,” Guillen said.
Some students said they don’t stop to consider sodium intake before grabbing a bite to eat on campus.
Alexa Pace, a junior majoring in psychology, said she never thinks about sodium levels.
“I haven’t really noticed [nutritional information] but I’m sure it’s somewhere,” Pace said.
Marissa Honda, a graduate student studying music performance, said campus options are sparse for those trying to eat healthily.
“I assume [on-campus food options] are not as healthy as the food I make at home, but there are ways you could make it healthy,” Honda said. “Students can get healthy items like salad from the Seeds Marketplace.”
Honda said restaurants like Submarina, which was located in The Lot before the opening of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, provided students with healthier options.
Alicia McDonough, professor of physiology and biophysics at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said it can be hard to make healthy choices on campus when there are few low-sodium options.
“Even here at the Health Sciences Campus, I’m faced with a cafeteria that has a Panda Express, which has an extremely high sodium content, a little Mexican place and counters and counters of processed food,” McDonough said. “I always think, ‘What are we trying to do here? Are we trying to give people hypertension and cardiovascular disease?’”
McDonough had a few words of wisdom for students who are trying to limit their sodium intakes.
“Eat a banana or a salad,” she said. “Just try to eat things that look like real food.”
I have always used coupons, but if I thought the generic was cheaper I would just buy that instead of the smaller name brand size or even samples from “Get Official Samples” can help

Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry, a Medal of Honor recipient, shared the story of his life-changing service in the military and emphasized the importance of a support system at “A Wounded Warrior’s Experience and Physical Rehabilitation,” an event sponsored by the USC Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans & Military Families along with the Division of Occupational Science & Occupational Therapy, in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Wednesday.
Four years ago, Petry was deployed to Afghanistan, where he lost his right hand when he tossed away a grenade that was near him and two fellow soldiers. President Barack Obama presented him with the Medal of Honor in July 2011, but Petry said he feels others deserve the award.
“I look at those guys as my brothers and children,” Petry said. “To see one action regarded so highly seems unfair. It belongs to every service member, especially those that have given the ultimate sacrifice.”
Petry has an advanced prosthetic hand capable of detecting outside resistance and that responds to his muscle contractions and skin receptors. Petry can pinch, grab and rotate his wrist.
He said he was happy his experience could inspire others.
“Injuries like mine used to be a free ticket out [of the army], but I take it as a golden opportunity,” Petry said.
Petry decided to re-enlist as a liaison officer for the United States Special Operations Command Care Coalition to help the wounded and be part of unit’s support system.
“To see their resilience as they get past the milestones of losing limbs lifts my heart,” Petry said. “I always advise soldiers to use their peers because they play a tremendous role in the rehabilitation process because they push them to continue to improve.”
USC intends to honor veteran students with several events throughout November, which includes a panel for those transitioning from the military to college, said Karen McNulty, an occupational therapist and assistant professor of clinical occupational therapy.
McNulty said it is important to make sure veterans feel welcome and comfortable at USC.
“Veterans feel like they’re part of a different culture because they have had different life experiences that might cause them to feel separated and unwelcome,” McNulty said. “We have to establish trust with them so they can reach out and feel like they are supported.”
This year, USC Student Affairs also added Transfer and Veteran Student Programs, which helps veteran students transition into campus life.
Florence Clark, professor, associate dean and division chair of occupational science and occupational therapy, said Petry demonstrated selflessness that students should know about and experience.
“Students need to get a sense of what soldiers go through and treat them with the utmost respect at all times,” Clark said. “If they get to know them they will know what truly matters most in life.”

It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.
Despite placing just seventh and eighth in its previous two tournaments, USC placed first in the Gifford Collegiate Championship at the CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin, Calif., to wrap up its fall slate of play, while senior Steve Lim also captured his first individual title as a Trojan.
In the final round, Lim shot a 69 which earned USC its first title of the season. For the tournament, Lim finished 11-under 202 (66-67-69).
“It was a great victory for our program,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “We all felt capable of having a week like this. It is great to go into the break with a win.”
Following the second round of play, USC had a 12-stroke lead which helped them fight off Pac-12 rival UCLA in the final round.
The Trojans finished 8-under 1057 (345-352-360) and four shots better than UCLA’s 4-under 1061 (348-361-352).
UCLA  All-American Patrick Cantlay finished 10-under 203 (63-70-70). Fellow Pac-12 school Oregon placed third and finished at 20-over 1085.
Sophomore Jeffrey Kang had a final round of 69 and finished sixth at even-par 213 (68-76-69). Kang had four birdies which helped him garner his first top-six finish this season.
Freshman Anthony Paolucci tied for 13th at 3-over 216 (68-76-72). Paolucci had two birdies and was 1-under in his round before a double bogey on his third to final hole.
Sophomore Ramsey Sahyoun tied for 17th at 4-over 217 (74-66-77). Sahyoun had his best round in the second round of the competition at USC in which he shot a 66.
Juniors Martin Trainer and Sam Smith tied for 20th at 5-over 218. Trainer (73-70-75) had four birdies in the final round. A quadruple bogey for Smith (70-73-75) ultimately tarnished a decent round.
USC will next compete in The Big Island Invitational in Waikoloa, Hawaii. The tournament commences Wednesday, Feb. 1 and wraps up  Friday, Feb. 3.

During her career, recent USC graduate Maria Sanchez received national recognition for her play, including winning the 2010 singles championship of the USTA/ITA National Indoors Intercollegiate Championships.
Thursday, four Women of Troy will have an opportunity to make a little history of their own at the same tournament. The tournament, which runs through Sunday, features 32 of the nation’s best collegiate singles players and 20 doubles teams from universities across the country.
Junior Danielle Lao, along with freshmen Zoe Scandalis and Sabrina Santamaria, will play in the singles bracket, while sophomore Kaitlyn Christian will team up with Santamaria for doubles action. The Women of Troy will try to fill the void left by Sanchez, who defeated California’s Jana Juricova for the 2010 singles title. Juricova enters this year’s tournament as the top-seeded player.
Lao is competing in the NIIC for the second consecutive season after qualifying for an at-large bid. She is eager to improve on her 2010 first-round exit.
“I feel like I’m a much more complete player in general,” Lao said. “And above all, I’m mentally stronger.”
Lao said she enjoys traveling to New York for the competition and the opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation for the professionals who take to these same courts every year.
“Going over there [the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center] and looking at the lockers of the professional players really gives me chills,” Lao said. “It’s a trip I really look forward to. I work toward this tournament.”
USC coach Richard Gallien echoed Lao’s sentiments and reiterated the importance of the NIIC.
“This and Riviera are the two biggest [tournaments],” Gallien said, referring to the Riviera All-Americans in early October. “This one is special for a different reason. It’s neat that it’s in New York at the site of the U.S. Open. And the fact that we have three players in the [singles] draw and the draw is only 32 players is very good for our team.”
Meanwhile, Santamaria is coming off a victory at the ITA Southwest Regional Championships, a win that guaranteed her a spot in the NIIC.
“I still can’t believe it. It feels so surreal,” Santamaria said. “I’m super happy that I could win it for [USC] and my teammates.”
Santamaria admits she is less familiar with indoor courts and the challenges that come with playing on a different surface, but is eager to give it her best shot.
“I feel pretty good right now, coming off those wins,” Santamaria said. “I feel pretty confident. I’ve never played in Indoors actually, so this will be my first time competing [there]. We’ll see how it goes, I’m hoping for the best.”
In the first round of the singles bracket, Scandalis will face off against Notre Dame senior Kristy Frilling, Santamaria will take on SMU senior Marta Lesniak and Lao will play Columbia sophomore Bianca Sanon. In the doubles bracket, USC’s duo of Christian and Santamaria drew the Tyler JUCO tandem of Kerrie Cartwright and Audrey Leitz.
“Everyone’s tough,” Lao said. “This is usually the top 32 girls in the nation. Maybe not in the preseason rankings, but the top 32 girls that are playing their best tennis right now. Anyone can win this tournament.”

With the top men’s tennis players converging today in the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., two players from the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team hope to notch singles titles in the esteemed four-day tournament.
Last stand · Senior Daniel Nguyen, in his first appearance at the ITA National Indoors, hopes to capture the singles individual championship. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 15 sophomore Ray Sarmiento will participate in a loaded 32-player singles draw that includes all of the top 10 players in the nation. The tournament will take place in the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, home of the U.S. Open.
Nguyen will begin his run against No. 1 seed freshman Mitchell Frank from Virginia, who, despite his age, captured the ITA Men’s All-Americans singles title in early October and has yet to lose a singles match in his collegiate career.
En route to his championship in the All-Americans, Frank defeated five seniors, including Nguyen, No. 5 Chase Buchanan of Ohio State and No. 7 Dennis Nevolo of Illinois. In the semifinals of the tournament, Frank upset Nguyen 4-6, 2-6.
“This is my last season, so I definitely want to try and do well, maybe even win it,” Nguyen said. “It’s definitely a special tournament for me.”
Nguyen hopes to exact his revenge on Frank on Thursday at 1 p.m., and Sarmiento will challenge No. 6 seed Buchanan on the same day at 3:30 p.m.
Sarmiento will play for the first time since his championship performance in the ITA Southwest Regionals in Malibu two weeks ago.
“It’s always great to win tournaments, so it’s definitely a confidence booster,” Sarmiento said. “Daniel and I have both been to New York, so we have a good feel of the courts in Flushing.”
For the past two years, USC senior Steve Johnson has represented the Trojans in the finals of the Indoor Championships, taking home the 2009 title and losing in 2010. With Johnson taking the fall semester off, Nguyen and Sarmiento hope to maintain USC’s presence at the tournament.
“I just talked to [Johnson] about the courts, and he told me that it’s really quick, and I need to try to transition a lot and come into the net,” Nguyen said. “I definitely feel like I prepared myself for New York.”
Nguyen gained entry to the Indoor Championships after advancing past the quarterfinals of the All-Americans, and Sarmiento earned his berth for winning the ITA Regionals.
“These guys both legitimately earned it,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “Daniel getting to the semis of the All-Americans and Ray winning the regionals without losing a set says a lot about how much our guys are improving.”
The National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships began in 1978 for men and 1984 for women, and past champions and finalists of the tournament include professionals Bob and Mike Bryan, James Blake, John Isner, Laura Granville and Lisa Raymond.
Despite the tournament’s prestige, Sarmiento is not fazed.
“It’s one of the biggest tournaments in the fall, but I’m also going to treat it like it’s any other tournament,” Sarmiento said. “We’re prepared to play and make a good run.”

USC held its last practice of the week Wednesday morning to prepare for its Friday game against Colorado in Boulder, Colo. The team, however, has come across a small issue: It might have two new defensive starters in the secondary.
Question mark · Junior safety Jawanza Starling did not practice Wednesday and is uncertain if he will play at Colorado on Friday. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
With junior safety T.J. McDonald suspended for the first half of the game and junior Jawanza Starling not practicing because of injury, the Trojans could be without both of their starting safeties.
“[Having two new safeties] could be the case,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said, “with Jawanza not practicing today and obviously the [Pac-12] deciding T.J. can’t play.”
Kiffin expects two older players will get the starting safety nods Friday: senior Marshall Jones and junior Drew McAllister.
“They’re good stories when guys that have played a bunch before get another shot,” Kiffin said. “A year ago when [senior linebacker] Chris Galippo came in at a backup role and played better, so hopefully, that will be one of those cases.”
Not only is Starling in jeopardy of not playing Friday, redshirt freshman Dion Bailey, a starting linebacker, was limited in practice after sustaining a concussion against Stanford last Saturday.
—
Though he has not missed any games this season, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods has not been fully healthy this year.
“For whatever reason, that ankle just won’t get right,” Kiffin said, regarding Woods’ status. “Some days it’s really bad, some days it just hampers him a little bit. Unfortunately, he can’t get back.”
Statistically, Woods had a decent outing against the Cardinal last Saturday, catching nine balls for 89 yards and one touchdown. But Woods uncharacteristically dropped a couple passes, particularly one that would have led to a USC touchdown.
“We take it for granted how rare [a Woods’ dropped pass] is,” Kiffin said. “As good as he is, if you miss that much practice, you’re just going to be a little bit out of rhythm.”
—
Kiffin named junior Curtis McNeal the starting tailback for this Friday.
“Curtis will start regardless [of Marc Tyler’s health],” Kiffin stated. “But I do hope that Marc plays and as of right now, he’s scheduled to go on the trip, and we’ll continue to test him starting with tomorrow morning again.”
Kiffin also praised his current starter.
“You want to see guys improve all the time, and he’s really improved in the run game and pass protection,” Kiffin said. “Early on in the year, our fear was pass protection, picking everything up and all the different rules, and he’s really done a great job with that, being a smaller guy.”
—
Kiffin revealed that redshirt freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins received more reps and would be able to play in particular situations.
“There are some scenarios where Jesse would go in,” Kiffin said. “So that’s why we gave him some more practice this week, now that he’s fully healthy.”
Besides Starling and Tyler, freshman tailback George Farmer did not practice and senior tight end Rhett Ellison was very limited. Kiffin did not give any timetable for Farmer’s return.

It’s getting harder and harder to believe USC isn’t getting the raw end of the deal.
I’ll admit that through all of the proceedings and transgressions in the last year-and-a-half I’ve been quick to justify the NCAA and other groups’ treatment of the Trojans’ football program, trying to maintain a stance that the treatment is fair.
But in last Saturday’s game against Stanford, the officiating made it a lot more difficult to keep playing along.
To be clear, all we know is what USC coach Lane Kiffin told us: He said the sideline official assured him he’d be awarded a timeout if it was ruled that sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods’ knee was down inbounds with time left on the clock, but after the play was reviewed by head referee Michael Batlan, he wasn’t.
And if that is, in fact, what they told Kiffin, he’s justified in his complaint.
The NCAA rulebook reads that if the clock expires during a play in the second or fourth quarter, “If Team A has a timeout available, it may elect to use one and the clock will be adjusted to its reading at the time the runner should have been ruled down. If Team A elects not to use a timeout, the half or game is completed.”
According to Kiffin’s story, the officials should have honored the timeout after the review showed that Woods was down with one second remaining on the game clock.
It’s possible Kiffin isn’t giving us the whole story, but the problem is we’ll never know.
There’s a shocking lack of transparency with officiating crews, and one wonders why no one from that side of things came out to comment on the situation. Instead, the Pac-12 slapped Kiffin with a $10,000 fine to avoid broaching the subject.
Ordinarily, I’d be OK with the fine, because Kiffin did question the credibility of the officials.
But in this situation, in which a rule might have been misinterpreted, someone needs to defend the credibility of these officials because it’s legitimately in question.
In fact, there was another situation a few minutes earlier that raises further questions.
On the previous Stanford drive in which the Cardinal tied up the game, there was a run by tailback Stepfan Taylor that was reviewed by the officiating crew to determine the spot. Before the review took place, the clock trickled down to 3:18. The review showed his knee was down earlier on the play, at which point the clock read 3:33.
No time, however, was added back to the clock before the next play after the review. It stayed at 3:18.
Now, in that situation, the clock would have run from 3:33, so not all that time would have been preserved. But Stanford was running a hurry-up offense to get in to the end zone, so it’s no stretch to think it would have gotten a play off within 15 seconds after the spotting of the ball. And it ended up being a matter of one second. If the referees added time back to the clock here and things progressed as they did, USC probably would have been able to attempt that field goal.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott has done a great job running the conference so far, and he’s definitely the right man for the job, as evidenced by the conference’s latest TV deal. But what he must address now is making sure these officials aren’t harming the reputation of the conference.
These could have been honest mistakes. Maybe there’s nothing to complain about. But combined with the decision to suspend junior safety T.J. McDonald for one half of Friday’s game against Colorado for his supposedly late hit out of bounds in the fourth quarter against Stanford, it really seems as if somebody isn’t on USC’s side.
If Scott or a head of officials simply spoke to the media and explained the error or admitted a mistake, this could all go away. When you couple the power that these officials have to affect games with the protection of not having to account for their decisions, it’s going to raise questions about the fundamental fairness of the conference.
Let’s hear what they have to say.
 
“Suicide Blitz” runs Thursdays. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Danny at savitzky@usc.edu.
Unfortunately with USC on probation, we won’t get the calls.
the SEC has been doing this for years. wake up and smell the coffee, gotta protect the title contenders
Probably the bigget officiating error was the misplacement of the ball on the final game tying Stsnford drive when holding was called against Stanford creating a 3rd and 2 instead of a 3rd and 20.  Offensove holding is spotted from the spot of the foul and the foul was onthe line of scrimmage.  Guess which school the Ref played for when he wad a college football player?  Notre Dame.
I agree. Many calls seemed to go against USC. No Pass Int. call in end zone when Woods was most definitely
bumped and interfered with in 1st qtr.
Its is almost like Pac-12 wants Stanford to run table and be in BSCS champ game so conference gets status and $$$$?????? no, really???

In a perfect world, junior tailback Curtis McNeal would not have fumbled on the goal line to end last Saturday’s triple-overtime thriller against Stanford.
Perseverance · Despite having a rough childhood and struggling during his first couple of years at USC, junior tailback Curtis McNeal has worked his way to become a key part of the Trojans’ backfield. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
In a perfect world, McNeal would have taken the first-and-goal carry and plowed his way through the defensive line en route to his third touchdown of the night.
But if there’s anything you should know about the player who now stands as the face of the Trojan backfield, it’s that his life has never been filled with pathways to paradise.
After his father was affected by a life-altering stroke when he was six years old, McNeal spent his early years in South Los Angeles’ Pueblo del Rio housing projects.
“To me, living in the projects was fun, but that’s all I knew,” McNeal said. “As I grew up, I started realizing what was around me. In high school, I saw firsthand the different side of life that existed. There were different avenues I could have taken. I tried to open up my mind and really ask myself what did I truly want in life?”
That answer came through football.
Despite his 5-foot-7, 180-pound stature, McNeal burst onto the map with a statistical marvel junior season at Venice High School in 2006, when he ran for 2,008 yards and 42 touchdowns.
In 2007, McNeal would follow up his All-L.A. City first-team campaign with a sensational senior season, in which he rushed for 1,400 yards and 19 touchdowns and was named the city’s offensive MVP.
“Mentally and physically I believed I could do better for myself,” McNeal said. “My sister Sonja always pushed me to become a better version of myself and showed me that there is a better side to life. College for me represented a new door, almost like a new life.”
Though he was offered a scholarship to USC by then-USC coach Pete Carroll to play for the Trojans after graduation, McNeal’s college experience got off to a rocky start.
After redshirting in 2008, McNeal was forced to the back of a tailback rotation led by proven veterans Joe McKnight, C.J. Gable and Allen Bradford. He registered just six carries for 33 yards in 2009.
“If you have told me after 2009 that I would be where I am now, I’m not sure I would have believed you,” McNeal said. “On one hand I would have believed I could, just because I know who I am and what I’ve been through. At the same time, that experience was really hard for me.”
Unable to cope with the hardships he faced on the field, McNeal’s attitude toward school and football began to take a nose-dive. With post-season probation and a regime change taking the spotlight in his sophomore year, his love and passion for the game were quickly erased by apathy.
McNeal was eventually ruled academically ineligible for the entire 2010 season, a point he refers to as “one of the biggest wake up calls of [his] life.”
This year began much the same way 2009 had for the hard-nose back from South Los Angeles. Having missed an entire year because of academic problems, McNeal had to prove himself to USC coach Lane Kiffin and his coaching staff on the field and off of it.
But the moment the whistle blew this August, there was a renewed sense of spirit in No. 22. A year away from the game had clearly changed him, and for the first time in his collegiate career, he ran as if each snap were a privilege.
Each stride was filled with newfound meaning, almost as if he were proving something not only to himself but to those who never believed he would one day reach the lofty expectations he set out for himself.
“I probably do run with a bit of a chip on my shoulder these days,” McNeal said. “Especially with my height and where I came from, people have always wanted to doubt me. They used to tell me, ‘You can’t do this or you can’t do that.’ So, when I run the ball, I let the opponent know that taking me down will never be easy. It’s always going to be a fight, because I never want to give up even an inch.”
If McNeal’s nay-sayers thought his fall camp fortitude was a mere facade, his first eight games have quickly erased any doubts. Due in part to D.J. Morgan’s fumbling issues and Marc Tyler’s lingering shoulder injury, McNeal has been the Trojans’ go-to tailback in the last month.
After scoring his first two career touchdowns against Arizona and California, McNeal has shown a propensity for the bright lights, posting back-to-back career-high performances against Notre Dame and Stanford — a combined 263 yards rushing and two touchdowns of 25 and 56 yards a piece.
While McNeal’s numbers have quickly made him a household name in Southern California, it’s his resolve and heart of which he’s most proud.
“Most people would likely have doubted that after being academically ineligible or after falling down the depth chart amongst so many talented running backs, I would push myself all the way up to the top,” McNeal said. “I grew up over these last few years, and now I’m finally able to see it all pay off.”
Despite his game-ending fumble against the Cardinal — which kept him up most into the early hours of Sunday morning — McNeal will be asked to fulfill a new role on Friday against Colorado, the starting tailback position.
It’s a role that culminates an unbelievable journey 15 years in the making.
“I think this opportunity says a lot about my journey and that I kept fighting through all of the hardships I have faced, whether it be with growing up, school or football,” McNeal said. “This is only the beginning for me. My journey is just taking off. I’m trying to graduate from college and maybe one day reach the NFL. My dream is that the next chapter is even better than the one I’m currently living.”
Why do you Daily Trojan columnists constantly insist on altering quotes with bracketed language.  In the sentence “McNeal was eventually ruled academically ineligible for the entire 2010 season, a point he refers to as ‘one of the biggest wake up calls of [his] life,'” the meaning was not improved by replacing “my” with “[his]”.  In fact, this construction is internally inconsistent as there are numerous other quotes throughout the piece from McNeal referring to himself in the first person.  Unless it is going to dramatically improve readability, leave quotes alone.
Great story about a great Trojan.  Fight on!
Good article… There you go McNeil my man.. What a beast. He kinda starting to remind me of that elusive hard to bring down RB Quiz Rodgers. Hope he can see how proud The Trojans are of him this season and doesn’t let the Stanford game get him down.
So funny how that guy caught it in the groin in the Stanford game trying to tackle McNeil and you could see McNeil get up and quickly with glance gesture something equal to “thats right fool!” lol. Of course McNeil did not know at the time what happened to that player, probably just that he got the wind knocked out of him which is common in football.
He slammed into 250 lb+ Stanford defenders for 4 hours and just kept coming back at them. No question he has the toughness to go the whole game and then some. Tear it up in Colorado McNeil , Fight On !!!!
good article, like reading something by plashke

Does anyone remember Michael Jackson’s posthumous album “Michael” very well? That might be for good reason.
The album was a product of varying artistry, lacking Jackson’s input (obviously) in any production after the initial recording process. Add this tremendous flaw to the awkward duets with Lenny Kravitz, 50 Cent and Akon and the album was subpar to say the least.
But aren’t these issues most posthumous albums run into? Generally, but here’s hoping that the newest addition to the posthumous album collection will be just as good as the artist’s other two chart-topping records, Frank and Back to Black.
Amy Winehouse died in her home on July 23 due to alcohol poisoning, but her music is still thriving.
Island Records plans to release the singer’s third studio album Lioness: Hidden Treasures in December. This 12-track album will feature the song “Body & Soul,” currently present on Tony Bennet’s Duets II, and an as-of-unreleased track “Halftime.”
A portion of the album’s soon-to-be monstrous sales will be donated to charity in order to assist disadvantaged children and young adults. Winehouse’s father set up the charity in his daughter’s name following her death.
Interestingly enough, Mitch Winehouse has also been extremely involved in the making of this final record. He told Billboard.biz that “If the family had felt that this album wasn’t up to the standard of Frank and Back To Black we would never have agreed to release it and we believe it will stand as a fitting tribute to Amy’s musical legacy.”
Hopefully Winehouse’s album will be sonically familiar and respectable. This collection of works crafted before her death will be released Dec. 5 on iTunes and in retail stores.

Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt finally announced Tuesday he would sell the baseball team, months after Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig took control of the team in May.
McCourt had been struggling to afford to pay the team’s costs and was locked in a legal battle with ex-wife Jamie McCourt over who had owners rights to the Dodgers when the MLB first took over. McCourt had spent much time attempting to secure TV deals to make up for lack of funds, but the potential contracts had fallen through.
“As a Dodger fan and an Angeleno, it has been a very, very tough season,” said Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to the Los Angeles Times. “I’m looking forward to local ownership.”
McCourt originally gained ownership of the Dodgers in 2004 for $421 million. The team is now expected to sell for two or three times that.
A potential bidder for the team could be current NBA Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who has been attempting to buy a baseball team for some time (he bid on the Texas Rangers last year but did not win).
The Times reported that fans and the baseball community were overjoyed at McCourt’s decision after a tumultuous few years.
“I’m on the happy side,” Luis Olazabal, dressed in a blue Dodger hoodie, told the Times. “I don’t think [McCourt] really cares for the Dodgers. I love the Dodgers. He looks at it as a business and I’m looking at it as Dodgers are my son. For me, it’s personal.”

As of Nov. 1, Oakland police are going under investigation by the Citizens’ Police Review Board regarding the police projectile that fractured the skull of Iraq veteran Scott Olsen during a peaceful protest in Oakland on Oct. 25, according to The Guardian.
Initially after the event it was announced that there would not be an investigation of the questionable tactics of the Oakland police, causing a substantial disappointment and disapproval among the protestors.
Coupled with Occupy movement stories are presumed police brutality claims. From protesting women being pepper-sprayed in New York to a woman being pinned between two mounted police horses in Portland, there is a speculated trend of over-aggressive force plaguing protestors. Veteran Scott Olsen’s experience in Oakland has led veterans across America to voice their support of the occupation movements by offering empirical knowledge and practical advice to civilian protestors.
Paige Jenkins, a veteran of the U.S. Navy and California National Guard currently studying military social work at USC, said veterans should act as “peacekeepers” and offer advice to protestors on survival and self-defense techniques. Another group, Occupy Marine, supplied protestors with materials to aid them through the winter season.
Groups like Occupy Marine, Veterans for Peace and Veterans for Common Sense support the movements taking place around the country and condemn the police brutality. In addition, they believe cuts in government assistance programs could severely impact the lives of veterans returning in 2012 who will need jobs and benefits upon arrival.
“We shouldn’t have to fight for our benefits, and if vets are fighting for their benefits then it can’t be any better for non-vets,” said Jenkins.

Some time during the ’70s or ’80s, a man named Robert Leitch came across some curious-looking items on a curb. The objects, contained in boxes and bags, turned out to be intriguing, complex art pieces from things like coins, mirror fragments and cigarette packs. The artist, who has yet to be identified, has been dubbed the Philadelphia Wireman, and he is just one example of the many daring, innovative and creative pioneers reshaping artistic media.
At first, Leitch gave away the items as unique presents, until a curator by the name of John Ollman talked Leitch into sharing the pieces. Now, decades later, 29 of the works are displayed in a new Philadelphia exhibition in the Fleischer/Ollman Gallery.
A variety of famous and underground artists, like the Philadelphia Wireman, are creating art from anything they can get their hands on and are adding excitement to the art world with kooky innovation.
What results is fascinating work even more interesting because of its unconventional media. While every artist learns to use the same basic media, there are some people pushing the boundaries of art and transforming commonplace objects into riveting works of art.
Los Angeles native Mike Stilkey, for example, creates paintings on unusual surfaces like record covers and pages. But his most impressive works are his book sculptures, book stacks whose spines are painted on and arranged to form an image.
Some pieces contain less than 10 books while others contain so many books that they reach impressive heights. Most of the paint is placed on the spines of the books, but Stilkey also uses the front and back covers as well. The subjects of his pieces include anything from whimsical human characters to fantastical, animal ones. One of his largest pieces depicts a man with a top hat playing a long, winding piano. Stilkey still displays his art today; he was a part of the PULSE contemporary art fair at L.A. Live and is currently exhibiting with other artists at Lebasse Projects in Culver City.
Some pieces, such as Simon Rodia’s “Watts Towers,” are even more groundbreaking because they incorporate a vast array of materials. Rodia’s massive work includes 17 sculptures and is the result of 34 years of work on a lot of land Rodia purchased in 1921.
“Watts Towers” is a collection of steel spires Rodia created without the help of basic tools like scaffolding. Rodia worked as a construction hand, which probably helped him technically, but the more compelling fact is that the towers are peppered with details, such as seashells and various abstract, hand-drawn designs. The works are also impressive in their stature, with one spire reaching up to a shocking 99.5 feet in height. Rodia’s work makes use of sundry materials, going beyond the usual idea of a consolidated medium and composition. You can view the site easily without paying for admission, but if you visit, you benefit from the expertise of tour guides and a closer look.
If these concepts and artists don’t seem to pique your curiosity, surely neon art can. A kooky form of art, it has enjoyed some attention in the past — with some pieces even making it into people’s homes as decorations. Lili Lakich, one of the most prolific artists behind the neon movement, has created everything from a neon sculpture of Elvis to more general works, such as sculptures made of things like film reel and neon lights in the shape of a human profile with words like “art” and “cinema” on them. Lakich is also the founder of the Museum of Neon Art in Glendale.
Art will naturally continue to change over the decades, but it won’t truly grow if artists don’t push themselves into exploring new media. When an artist uses something completely new to create a work of art, he or she forces viewers to look at art in a different way. And there is something about using familiar or creative materials that makes art as a whole more inclusive and enticing. Even if you’re not a huge fan of Renaissance paintings or abstract works, there is something immediately captivating about a neon Elvis or a painting done on the spines of books. The world is replete with materials that can be integrated into the next buzz-worthy piece so for new artists, the possibilities are virtually endless.

The day after putting away their Halloween costumes, USC students had the privilege of meeting the creator of some of the Halloween world’s most popular fictional characters: Jack Skellington and Edward Scissorhands.
Charismatic gal · Caroline Thompson’s screenplays, noted for their gothic elements, strange characters and unique storylines, serve as inspiration for writers trying to set themselves apart. - Carrie Ruth Moore | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday, screenwriter Caroline Thompson paid a visit to the Ray Stark Family Theater, a feature of School of Cinematic Art’s “Writing Presents…” series. The theater was jam-packed with adoring fans and aspiring film writers as Thompson was interviewed by Professor Mary Sweeney of SCA’s Screenwriting Department.
During the event, Thompson, who helped write The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands and Black Beauty, shed light on her career.
“I always wanted to be a writer even before I was a reader or a movie watcher,” Thompson said. “I’m not quite sure why, but I always knew that it was what I wanted to do.”
Thompson’s screenplays are distinguished for their gothic elements, such as characters who don’t belong and storylines that don’t typically conform to the Hollywood ideal. In Corpse Bride, Victor is transported to the Land of the Dead where he nearly marries a dead bride-to-be. In Edward Scissorhands, a character with scissors for hands tries to adjust to life in sunny suburbia. In Homeward Bound, a remake of The Incredible Journey, a group of abandoned household animals tries to find its way back home.
Though Thompson’s movies have unique plots, they all feature similar underdog characters — an idea Thompson is drawn to.
“My mission on this planet is to tell people what it feels like to be a dog,” Thompson said, “That means what it feels like to live in a world that’s not made for you, and that’s sort of what I love to write about. It’s that feeling of being left out.”
After graduating from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and Amherst University, Thompson moved to Los Angeles to begin a literary career. She wrote her first novel, First Born, in 1983, and later worked with director Penelope Spheeris to adapt the story for the big screen.
Moved by the director’s work on the documentary The Decline of Western Civilization, Thompson built a close relationship with Spheeris, and ultimately discovered her passion for screenwriting. Though First Born was never turned into a movie, Thompson found a new avenue for her creativity.
Shortly after working with Spheeris, Thompson wrote Edward Scissorhands. Working with composer Danny Elfman and director Tim Burton, who was also just beginning to work in the film industry, Thompson drafted a plot for a protagonist with scissors for hands based on some high school drawings Burton had shown her.
“I thought that was the stupidest f–king thing I ever heard,” Thompson said, reflecting on Tim Burton’s drawings. “And I knew it was genius. It lends itself to so many layers of understanding and misunderstanding in the world.”
After working on Edward Scissorhands, Thompson crafted screenplays for The Addams Family, Homeward Bound, The Secret Garden and, later, one of the most popular animated films of all time, The Nightmare Before Christmas, where she again joined forces with Burton and Elfman.
Following The Nightmare Before Christmas, Thompson had her directorial debut with Black Beauty. Thompson wanted more freedom with her writing and used the success of Homeward Bound as leverage to direct her next film. As a writer who preferred solitary work, she ultimately found that taking a role as a people-friendly director was difficult.
“I found that parts of my personality that I had no idea existed came out while I was directing,” Thompson said. “I love prep, and the cutting room and mixing stage, but I just didn’t like the floor. You hear a lot of stories about writers wanting to direct, but there are a couple of ironies.”
Though she found her temperament was unsuitable for directing, Thompson’s screenwriting career still soared. She wrote scripts for Buddy, the Hallmark version of Snow White, Corpse Bride (where she again worked with Burton and Elfman) and City of Embers.
Finally, in 2006, she founded an online blog “Small and Creepy Things” with partners Steve Nicolaides and Micah Van Hove, where filmmakers and photographers post dark yet poignant art in a Tumblr-esque fashion.
“My husband and I were overwhelmed by the proliferation of material for the web and we thought, ‘If we can make a venue for our sensibility and that of others and showcase the work of young filmmakers, that would be a really cool thing to do,’” Thompson said.
Before ending her visit at USC, Thompson gave advice for the aspiring screenwriters in the audience.
“Truly it is not worth writing anything if it doesn’t come from inside you,” Thompson said. “There’s a sort of cynical attitude out there that, ‘Let’s give the studio what they want because I want to get my movie made.’ Well, what they want today is not what they’re going to want next week. It’s kind of soul-draining on a writer’s part to think you can give them what they want when they don’t know what they want.”
Thompson’s next projects are adaptations of Melissa Marr’s bestselling Wicked Lovely series and Mikhail Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita for the silver screen.
Thompson must have graduated from Radcliffe College; the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study was only founded in 1999 and does not grant degrees.

There are those who are science people and those who are not.
In flight · The California Science Center’s latest film, Flying Monsters 3D, which targets younger audiences with its visually pleasing scenes, ultimately succeeds as a family movie. The film’s well-written and executed script and modern integration of archaic beasts make the film a rewarding and enlightening experience for viewers of all ages. - Photo courtesy of California Science Center
Viewers will be pleasantly surprised to find that the California Science Center’s new IMAX 3-D exhibition, Flying Monsters 3-D, is entertaining for both crowds.
Narrated by Sir David Attenborough, Flying Monsters 3-D tells the story of the largest flying creature: the pterosaur.
Ever wonder how a creature that could stand head-to-head with a giraffe could also fly? Or perhaps how the dimorphodon evolved into a quetzalcoatlus? Well, your questions will be answered in detail in the film.
Though the bulky 3-D glasses are a bit of a turn off, the short film redeems itself through sweeping visuals, which feature the same 3-D, CGI technology audience members flocked to see in Avatar.
Without a reasonable narrative, 3-D visuals can often cheapen a film; Flying Monsters 3-D, however, benefits from the use of this evolving technology.
Scenes of pterosaurs, such as the darwinopterus, gliding through the air are a visual delight — 3-D turns the frame into a visual feast. Here, 3-D is used not to cover any flaws in the film’s storyline. Instead, the film’s visuals enhance the viewing experience, adding necessary depth to encapsulate the audience.
It feels as if you’re on the creatures’ backs, flying over the clouds.
This adventure-driven feature obviously caters toward the younger crowd. It’s easy to imagine your 8-year-old self fascinated by all the pretty colors. What’s surprising is how well the film keeps your interest, even if you’re a jaded college student.
Kudos must go to the script, which is concise. The film flies by in what seems like seconds, thankfully not boring the audience.
Part of the script’s success is how clearly the facts are presented and its lack of a completely omniscient voice. Rather than only hearing our narrator, we see him interact onscreen as well.
Director Matthew Dyas attempts to educate without appearing to teach a lesson, and he succeeds in doing so by mixing old elements with new ones.
In one scene, Attenborough is seen inspecting a fossil. Instead of merely preaching to the audience, the fossil magically rises and forms into a pterosaur. In another scene, Attenborough flies in a small-winged plane. Before long, a mammoth quetzalcoatlus — with a wingspan measuring between 33 and 40 feet — eclipses the plane’s size, illustrating the immensity of these creatures.
The effects freshen the material while allowing those who might not understand difficult scientific concepts to digest the information in an easier, more visual format.
Despite the film’s many strengths, some flaws are evident. Though Attenborough is an expert in his field and delivers each line with extreme enthusiasm, one cannot help but notice how much older he is than the target audience.
It’s possible some facts could be lost because of lack of interest in someone decades older; after all, it’s difficult for one to connect with a narrator he or she has nothing in common with.
A younger narrator would have been a much better fit for this modern, technology-driven film.
But aside from narration problems, Flying Monsters 3-D proves an impressive feat in filmmaking. Though the feature could have simply relied on 3-D to attract patrons, it instead demonstrates that a strong narrative, not just technology, makes a good film.
Hopefully, Hollywood will take notice and realize that spewing out lackluster films in 3-D doesn’t help a film — it runs the risk of ruining it.
Flying Monsters 3-D is perfect for families. Though it is didactic, it is also incredibly entertaining, leaving everyone in a good — and perhaps even an enlightened — mood.
Flying Monsters 3-D runs through Dec. 31 at the California Science Center.

The university recently launched a new graphic identity to promote a stronger, more unified image across the campus community. This change comes about with the expansion of USC entities as well as a push for a more explicit, streamlined logo and iconography.
The new look, which involves a redesigned logo and monogram as well as new typefaces, will now incorporate a shield logo as a main part of the schematic. The shield, which is a part of USC’s university seal, is meant to parallel the graphics of many top-caliber universities.
“This is an important time for USC to signal its continued evolution and ascent,” said vice president of public relations and marketing Brenda Maceo. “With a new administration, the launch of a historic fundraising campaign and a new strategic vision, we need to strengthen and align our graphic identity to reflect the high caliber of our students, faculty, academic units and programs.”
In order to maintain consistency, the university has adopted a policy prohibiting any additional iconography outside the new university shield, seal or Trojan head. This attempt at redesigning the USC identity will replace the previous USC logos, which were in place for more than 16 years.
USC teamed up with renowned design firm Pentagram to come up with the new “identity guidelines,” including selecting primary logotype fonts such as Adobe Caslon Pro, National and Frutiger. Each of USC’s academic units will receive a new logotype, which will soon be visible on all media.
The new graphic identity guidelines will soon be visible all over campus and in various publications and websites. Community members should note that there are strictly enforced guidelines surrounding the new graphic identity, including color combination requirements, alignment requirements and logo combinations.

Lyon Center needs renovation
Who else is looking forward to a new state-of-the-art digital media production facility, complete with new locker room, academic center, weight and meeting rooms to replace the less-than-desired Lyon Center? Hold that excitement — that is, if you are merely a student on campus, rather than a participant in one of USC’s 21 athletic programs. Costing upward of $70 million, the new Heritage Hall Student Athletic Center is a monument that has not gone unnoticed by USC students: those not a part of the athletic program, many of whom pay full tuition.
This is not to discredit our wonderful athletes by any means, but complaints about the less-than-great experience of the Lyon center are common, as are conversations about its failure to measure up against other Pac-12 schools’ gyms.
The Lyon Center is USC’s main gym for more than 17,000 undergraduate students, who are often frustrated by broken, malfunctioning machines donning “Out of Order” signs, with broken televisions.
Recently, overhearing a student athlete boasting about the new center — rightfully so — comparisons of the new athletic center versus the outdated Lyon Center sprang through my mind. I began to compare the popular Mansion student housing on 30th Street “New Mansion” to the “Old Mansion,” reliving many student frustrations of dealing with old, worn down amenities while those in the modern space pay the same amount of rent if not less than the residents of the run-down apartments next door.
Compare this to the students paying full tuition at USC, without any special advantages, with the benefits that student athletes receive: amenities, scholarships, housing, a special cafeteria, registration priorities and athletic facilities. That is not to say the student athletes do not deserve these special benefits, especially a new facility, as they ultimately spend more time there than anyone else.
It is hard to see the situation as equitable, however. USC Athletic Director Pat Haden has made the project one of his first priorities, saying last year: “Once this facility is completed, our physical infrastructure will be among the finest of any athletic department in the nation, and worthy of our student-athletes.”
This sounds like an amazing opportunity for the university to continue its recruitment of prospective athletes, but what about the uncoordinated “Average Joes” who might not be D1 material, but enjoy working out while catching up on some television (provided the TV works?)
With a $3.7 billion endowment, the administration could afford to vamp up the conditions of the Lyon Center. For those who work as hard in Leavey Library as sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods does on the field, should we be punished with an outdated, unsatisfying gym while trying to blow off some steam?

Great article! I completely agree that as USC is known for being such a wealthy and big institution, the students should benefit from having nice facilities, especially our sports one as we are known for our athletic programs. Where is all this money coming from with DPS getting new cars? Is that REALLY necessary? Couldn’t the school spend a mere $100,000- way less than these new cars- and just update some of the equipment? A new treadmill is a couple thousand dollars. Come on.
What many fail to realize is that a primary source of income for the University is athletics. TV deals, ticket sales, and MOST importantly alumni donations rely heavily on the success of our athletic programs, which in turn relies on the ability of USC to recruit the best athletes. Investing in new athletic facilities is investing in the University population as a whole because it increases income to the University.
Don’t assume that just because the money isn’t flowing directly towards you that you’re not benefiting.
Not only are the student facilities not the best, but during finals week the hours are limited. I used to encourage my students to attempt to keep their exercise program going, or recharge with exercise during exams, but at USC, the hours are decreased not increased, making it difficult to do that. I think you will find at many universities the hours are longer to accommodate weird student schedules. I hope this is improved at USC.
Hear Hear!!!
This needs to be addressed immediately, and yet, who is in charge of athletic facilities for the non-NCAA athletes? Nobody knows because nobody cares to let us know because it obviously is not a priority.
Whoever it is, they are doing a lousy job. This situation has been ignored for far too long, especially for a “Top Flight” university that charges more for room/board/fees that all but 12 schools in the entire country. We are definately not getting our monies worth.
Is this not important enough for you, Max?

Vegetarians, vegans, those with food allergies, or abide by Kosher standards, picky eaters — they all have one thing in common: Residential dining at USC is a little rough for them.
It is true that ducking into Everybody’s Kitchen or Parkside to take advantage of an unlimited meal plan between classes is super convenient.
It is also true that disappointing food is bound to be part of almost any college experience.
And this is a reality USC campus residents are not allowed to say no to.
It might ease the conscience of the Office for Residential Education knowing they have ensured a means for students to eat every day. Requring extensive meal plans for some students, however, simply doesn’t make sense.
They must have a meal plan, and for any of them specifically living in a dorm, this meal plan must be one that is costly.
It sends the message that freshmen — the vast majority of whom are legal adults — do not have the right to make their own decisions about what to eat, when to eat and where to get their food.
Neither EVK nor Parkside is required to provide a certain quantity of food friendly to vegans, allergy sufferers or others with different preferences.
Other dining venues, like the campus center, are not necessarily a better alternative to EVK or Parkside because many students cannot afford to dine at such venues every day.
Nor should they have to when they are already shelling out $2,500 or more per semester for a meal plan.
The same goes for students who would rather take a more active role in the management of their nutritional health.
The university, however, makes it impossible for students to live like this, perhaps because it might not believe students have the means to stay consistently and healthily fed.
In reality, it is possible to eat healthily without ever using an oven, or any of the appliances banned from USC dorm rooms; in fact, there’s a trend of nutrition known as raw foodism that uses this exact practice.
A mini fridge and some space under the bed will do the job just fine.
Such eating habits might come off as extreme to some, but there are several reasons behind not wanting a meal plan. One, of course, is dietary restriction.
Another might be that someone wants to learn more about cooking. A third is money.
The Cardinal Plan, the cheapest and most basic available meal plan for most residential freshmen, costs nearly $150 a week — far more than the average student independently spends on groceries.
A smart shopper can feed a family of four on $150 a week, according to The New York Times.
Requiring a meal plan for certain on-campus dorms tells students who would prefer an alternative dining arrangement that USC does not want them to be responsible for their own nutritional well-being.
The university could encourage student responsibility and cater better to unusual or restricted diets by making meal plans optional for all undergraduates.
As for the conscience of Residential Education? That problem can easily be fixed. A liability waiver could be made available to any on-campus residents who elect not to purchase a meal plan.
Students who make this choice could also be required to attend one or two counseling sessions at the Health Center to ensure they have their nutrition on track.
Food preferences tend to be as diverse as the students who have them; USC needs to bear this in mind and scratch its meal plan requirement.

Think of an iconic television series. Shows like Seinfeld, Star Trek and I Love Lucy probably come to mind.
Now, think of an iconic YouTube video — like that one where a panda sneezes.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
For some, it’s hard to see YouTube as a source of quality entertainment. Nevertheless, YouTube has a very different vision for itself; the company has plans to move beyond user-generated content. Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported YouTube will soon create original programming for more than 100 channels.
YouTube’s shrewd plan reflects a shift in our television habits. In the 20th century, cable television took radio’s place as America’s primary source of entertainment. This century, cable will be making way for a different supplier: the Internet.
The trend is already visible on college campuses. Most students are familiar with sites like Megavideo, where users can stream a seemingly infinite number of shows for free. Megavideo isn’t aesthetically pleasing, but it’s convenient enough to make most people overlook the grainy pictures.
As a result of streaming, many of us have stopped catching episodes when they air on cable. Instead, we watch them whenever it’s convenient. The Internet also provides access to older series, series that have been canceled and even ones that have never even aired in the United States.
These changes have already affected traditional cable channels. Take MTV’s decision to remake Skins, a popular British show. MTV was likely counting on a built-in market as Megavideo had introduced the original to thousands of web-savvy Americans.
The new version got canceled after one season. For people who already had access to the British version, a lackluster rehash just wasn’t enough.
These viewings will not always be confined exclusively to college students. Technological trends that start in college tend to spread fairly quickly.
It’s easy to forget that Facebook started out as a site for college kids. Nowadays, we struggle to hide our weekend pictures from our uncles, aunts and grandparents. Older generations have a strong online presence. If YouTube puts out more than 100 new channels, it isn’t a stretch to assume at least one of those channels will target an older generation.
The fall of cable has several implications for the future of media consumption.
First, viewers will have more choice than ever in what they consume. Big name brands will continue do everything they can to attract the largest share of viewers, but the Internet will accommodate everyone else. Building a website is much cheaper than building a traditional television channel. Media companies that can’t afford to spend big bucks will use viral marketing to spread content.
All that space will lead to niche interest channels. Think the Food Network is specific? Wait until there’s a channel devoted entirely to vegan baking.
Second, every television set will come with an internet connection. College students might be happy to curl up in their beds with a laptop, but families will want to gather around a screen. Smart televisions will allow families to continue to watch shows together — but the kids will be fighting over a mouse, instead of a remote control.
To prepare for the shift, traditional channels should start rethinking revenue models right now. Since its inception, YouTube has provided content for free, but traditional channels can’t say the same. Channels that want to stay ahead need to tackle an uncomfortable question: How can they make money when so many companies will be willing to give their shows away for free?
Six years ago, YouTube was born. Over the last two years, everyone from Katy Perry to President Barack Obama has signed up for accounts. The company’s ability to stay ahead of the times is remarkable.
We only have to wonder when everyone else will catch up.
