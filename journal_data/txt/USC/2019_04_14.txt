“Game of Thrones” returned after an almost two-year hiatus on Sunday. I binged the entire show in February, and it has become one of my all-time favorites. From the music to the production to the acting to Jaime Lannister, there are few television programs that leave me as excited or awestruck.
One of the things I enjoy the most about the show is the gender politics. “Game of Thrones” began as a show about men killing each other over power and revenge. Most of the characters’ awful decisions result from men being overconfident in their masculinity — like Robb Stark marrying Talisa against his mother’s advice or Joffrey Baratheon executing Nedd Stark out of sheer ignorance. When one man messes something up, more men rise up to take advantage or try to stop the damage from spreading. Something invariably breaks again, because these men’s solutions aren’t much better than the ones made by men before them.
Then something happened in the sixth season. For the first time, every major female character still alive found their agency. Danaerys Targaryen reclaimed her title of Khaleesi by killing all the men who threatened to enslave her. Sansa Stark single-handedly won a battle her brother would have lost by correctly assessing her enemy, taking back her home and feeding her abusive husband to a pack of dogs as a bonus. Cersei Lannister gathered all her enemies in one place and blew them up, then asserted herself as the first queen in Westerosi history.
This was by far my favorite season of the show for those reasons. Men ruined the world countless times and, finally, women rose up and tried doing things on their own terms. Westeros isn’t perfect  by any stretch of the imagination going into Season 8 but, for the first time in ages, their world has a chance to be better (so long as Cersei doesn’t stay on the throne by the end).
This weekend also marked another event — a little festival you might have heard of called Coachella. In recent years, the festival and others like it have been called out for promoting male headliners and featuring male-dominated lineups. This trend goes hand-in-hand with how pop music and the Grammys in recent years have been dominated by men, with female artists being told to “step up” if they want the same success and recognition. Men created an industry to pedal other men so we could get a half-dozen oversaturated Drake rip-offs and Ed Sheeran-type love songs without much in-between.
Yet, 2019 has the makings of a different narrative, and Coachella reflects that. Ariana Grande has dominated the pop scene, setting records with her album “Thank U, Next.” This year, she will also become the youngest, and one of the most anticipated, headliners in Coachella history. Then, there’s the recently released Beychella documentary commemorating Beyonce’s own historic headlining set, which made her the first black woman to headline in 2018. Her set has been talked about as one of the best in festival history — from its tight choreography to its extensive production design.
Kacey Musgraves won Album of the Year at the Grammys for “Golden Hour,” all in spite of country music tastemakers’ insistence on promoting male acts over hers on radio. Her set trended worldwide on Twitter, cementing her rise as one of the genre’s elite. K-pop girl group Blackpink became the first Korean group to perform at the festival, coming off of an electrifying EP released earlier this month.
Women are experimenting and pushing boundaries in exciting new ways this year. Like the leading ladies in “Game of Thrones,” real-life female artists have played the game with their male contemporaries and decided they want to play by their own rules instead. Hopefully, what’s being represented at Coachella is a turning point for greater change in the music world. The industry is far from perfect, but if this weekend is any indication, it’s looks better than it has in a while.

USC’s No. 5 men’s volleyball team kept its home undefeated streak alive with a three-set sweep over No. 15 Grand Canyon University in its first match of the postseason Saturday. Galen Center was booked for the evening, so the contest took place in the Physical Education Building’s historic North Gym, which once served as USC’s indoor volleyball venue.
The first two sets were strong victories for USC. The Trojans put together a pair of lengthy runs late in the first set and captured it by a healthy margin, winning 25-17.
Eager to answer back, Grand Canyon jumped out to a 5-3 lead over USC early in the second set, but the Trojans quickly tied things up and surged ahead. They soon found themselves up 10-6 and continued to hold a sizable lead for the remainder of the set, ultimately winning 25-19.
With just one set standing between them and the end of their season, the Antelopes put up a valiant effort in the third and final set of the match. The teams seemed to trade point for point for the majority of the set, but the Trojans pushed ahead at the tail end and won 25-22.
The story of the night was USC’s dominant offense: The Trojans had 40 kills, compared to the Antelopes’ 27. Senior outside hitter Ryan Moss led USC with 14 kills and 4 aces, while sophomore setter Chris Hall collected 33 of the team’s 37 assists. USC only tallied four blocks as a collective unit, but it hit at a .397 clip while holding GCU to .278 hitting.
USC’s impressive performance may have been fueled in part by the atmosphere generated by the raucous crowd of supporters who had gathered for the match. 
“It’s a really different environment,” senior outside hitter Jack Wyett said. “Galen Center is definitely more state of the art … but this is fun. You pack the gym and it feels like a full house … [It] brings [me] back to the high school days.”
The Trojans entered Saturday having won 10 of their last 12 matches, and their performance on Saturday exhibited the type of dominance that supporters have come to expect recently. Despite their impressive win, however, the Trojans remained humble in their victory.
“You definitely can’t underestimate a team like [GCU], especially going into the playoffs,” Wyett said. “Everyone … [gains] an extra step in confidence because [they’ve] got a lot to lose.”
With the season on the line, USC supporters certainly had plenty to cheer for throughout  the match. However, they were treated to a bit of a scare in the later stages of the third set when Wyett and senior libero Matt Douglas awkwardly collided while they were going after a dig. 
The action came to a halt as a team medic came out onto the floor to ensure that neither had been concussed or otherwise injured. Luckily, both were cleared and were able to help close out the match for the Trojans.
USC will need both starters to be at full health as it prepares to face UCLA at Pepperdine  Thursday. The Trojans recently defeated the Bruins in five sets on Senior Night at Galen Center, but have won only one of their nine matches in road environments this season. This win-or-go-home rivalry match on neutral territory will certainly be the Trojans’ greatest challenge yet.

Now that spring football practice has come to an end, the Trojans won’t take the field again to prepare for the 2019 season for two months. There’s no shortage of questions surrounding the team; the way it bounces back from last year’s disappointing season may define the program for years to come. 
Though little more than a month of spring football doesn’t make the answers to those questions much clearer, it does give a better idea of what to expect from some of the younger team members. 
Throughout spring ball, a number of early-enrollee incoming freshmen on both sides of the ball made strong cases for playing time in the fall. With the loss of so many veterans to the draft, the freshmen’s ability to step up and contribute will be perhaps the most critical factor in the coming season. 
Defensive back Briton Allen, a late flip from Georgia Tech, found his way into plenty of reps this spring as a result of the numerous injuries hampering the secondary. Allen performed impressively when thrust into the fire at cornerback in the early practices — a departure from his usual safety position. Though his technique and footwork in coverage have a ways to go, Allen’s raw football instincts and aggressiveness showed up regularly. 
Allen continued to play well once he was moved back to safety, a position where the Trojans sorely lack depth. With the loss of so many veteran players in the secondary and the injury woes of many that remain, Allen’s versatility could make him a crucial player in the fall.
Outside linebacker and defensive end Drake Jackson was perhaps the biggest shining star of spring ball. Jackson already looks the part of a Division I edge rusher, standing at 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds and having been compared to USC legend Leonard Williams by head coach Clay Helton. Jackson carries that frame with tremendous athleticism, showing a rare burst off the line of scrimmage along with a special quickness in moving off of blocks. 
Jackson showcased his raw physical ability during the spring showcase, where he made a ridiculous one-handed interception at the line of scrimmage and proceeded to run it back for a touchdown. Jackson has been one of the most disruptive players on the Trojan front seven throughout the spring, and seems likely to have a big role to play come fall.
On the other side of the ball, quarterback Kedon Slovis has been a pleasant surprise for the Trojans. The Arizona native came into the spring with few expectations other than to be the fourth-string quarterback, yet his strong play has caught the attention of everyone in attendance. 
Slovis showcases a natural understanding of the timing necessary for throws in offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s system, as well as refined touch on his passes. He doesn’t have the strongest arm, and his mobility is limited. However, his ability to quickly make reads and put the ball where and when it needs to be makes him worthy of notice at the position. Although it’s highly unlikely he wins the starting job, his ability to run the offense smoothly provides the Trojans with more security at signal caller — something a team always needs.
Fellow offensive newcomer wide receiver John Jackson III has been one of the most fun players to watch throughout the spring. From the first week of practice, Jackson has looked like he’s played in this offense for years. His route running is smooth and sudden, with exceptionally clean breaks that allow him to create separation with ease. His natural athleticism, sound hands and route-running ability made him a favorite target throughout spring ball, regularly making plays against the first team defense. 
Though the receiver room is crowded with an incredible amount of talent, Jackson’s performance so far should earn him the opportunity to fight for a bigger role in fall camp. It wouldn’t be a surprise to see him on the field regularly once the season begins.

I was 9 years old the first time I stepped foot into Oracle Arena, the home of the Golden State Warriors. Back then, it was simply called The Arena in Oakland. The date was April 17, 2006, and they were playing the Portland Trail Blazers. I still have the ticket stubs stashed in my room back home. I remember my parents driving me on a school night through rush hour traffic to Oakland so I could experience my first Warriors game. I couldn’t wait to tell my second-grade teacher the next day that I had watched my favorite team play live for the first time.
The Warriors won that game, a meaningless late-season contest in the midst of another meaningless season for what, at the time, was a sad franchise. I, alongside 16,277 other fans, sat through a game in which somebody named Ike Diogu started at power forward for the Warriors and we were applauding Derek Fisher’s high-arching free throws because what else was there to cheer for?
Not that that mattered to me. I have a vivid recollection of being led up to our cheap $10 seats by an usher and seeing an NBA court in person for the first time. And not just any NBA court, but the court where the Warriors play. Imagine believing in Santa Claus as a kid and then seeing him actually come down the chimney. That was how second-grade me felt when the curtains opened to Section 221 that night. 
Fast forward to the present day, as the Warriors — now the gold standard of NBA franchises — have already played their final regular season game in Oracle Arena ahead of their move across the bay to the Chase Center in San Francisco next season. They will finish off the postseason and probably win their third straight championship while calling Oracle home. 
We knew this was coming for years, but reality didn’t hit me until last Sunday, when I tuned into the final regular season home game and watched the Warriors come out to the court in their throwback “We Believe” jerseys. This was a tribute to the 2006-07 team that snuck into the playoffs for the first time in more than a decade as the final team in the Western Conference and then pulled off what is still the greatest upset in NBA history, shocking the 67-win Dallas Mavericks in the first round. 
That playoff series is still my favorite memory as a Warriors fan, even greater than this recent string of ridiculous success. Yes, they were eliminated in the second round, but beating the Mavericks introduced the world to Oracle Arena because that place was so loud that ESPN displayed a decibel tracker on the screen during the game. This was a fanbase thirsting for any semblance of success, and man, they more or less willed Dallas into submission with the noise they made. “We Believe” was the playoff slogan, and yes, we did believe. I watched from my couch in awe as my group of scrappy underdogs upset the favorite to win the championship.
So when Steph Curry ripped off his warm-up shirt last Sunday to reveal a “We Believe” retro jersey underneath, to which the crowd reacted with a thunderous ovation, I was hit with goosebumps … followed by sadness. I’m not one to care too much about jersey designs, but those were more than jerseys with “WARRIORS” in all caps across the front, the dark blue lettering outlined in gold and the blue and orange coloring on the side of the jersey down to the shorts. These jerseys represented the bridge between the never-ending dark days of the franchise and the championship-level dominance of today.
And then there is sadness, because Oracle Arena will soon be desolate, without a tenant, void of the deafening noise and the vibrant atmosphere that is every Warriors home game. Sure, the San Francisco arena will be nice, but it will be … different. It will feel gentrified, forced and corporatized. It will be way too pricey. And it will never recreate “Roaracle.” 
There was something authentic about the gameday experience at Oracle, even as more and more O.G. fans became priced out as a result of the team’s recent success, even as we were constantly reminded that it was the league’s oldest arena and that an upgrade was needed. Maybe it was because it was in Oakland, a hard-nosed, blue-collar town that is reflected in its genuine love for its sports teams. Maybe it was the countless times driving up the I-880 North corridor and seeing the arena light up the night adjacent to the Coliseum, home to the Oakland A’s and Raiders. Maybe it was our routine of eating at the In-N-Out or Panda Express a few blocks away before heading in for a game.
I am no longer awestruck at basketball arenas like I was 13 years ago. I have been fortunate to cover a handful of Warriors games, including the NBA Finals in 2017. But I have never covered a game at Oracle Arena, so whenever I attend a game there, it still feels like I was the same fan as my 9-year-old self. Soon, that experience that was such a defining memory of my childhood will be taken away. So rest assured, I will make it out to a playoff game in the coming months, ticket prices be damned. It will be worth it to take in Roaracle one final time.

Last August, entertainment news outlets reported that musical giants Donald Glover and Rihanna were filming a secret project in Havana, Cuba. On Nov. 24, Glover premiered the secret project’s trailer at the PHAROS Festival in Auckland, New Zealand. With Spotify ads and an early screening at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, “Guava Island” was finally released on Amazon Prime Saturday.
In the project, Glover portrays Deni Maroon, a musician who wants to plan a festival for the residents of Guava Island.
From the beginning, Glover’s creativity is on full display. The opening credits are beautifully animated to the new Childish Gambino track “Die With You.” Vibrant colors explode on the screen as the sequence effortlessly transitions between credits. 
From there, director Hiro Murai introduces viewers to the island. For an adventurous feel, Murai provides the film with a grainy look and old school television aesthetic. Furthermore, Murai strongly captures the cultural aura of the tropical setting with the costume design, the locals and Michael Uzowuru’s dreamy music.
Despite the star appeal of the Glover-Rihanna collaboration, the film doesn’t rely on cheap selling points, and “Guava Island” feels authentic to Glover’s vision. Both actors naturally play off each other in an infectious chemistry.
Glover especially seems more at ease working with his frequent crewmates, and he even has a few shining moments with his musical talents. “Guava Island” is interwoven with new songs penned by Glover, from “Die For You” to “Saturday,” which he performed on “Saturday Night Live.” The inclusion of these songs feels natural and fits within Glover’s cinematic world.
In fact, only Glover’s previously released songs feel out of place in the film. The scene featuring Glover’s smash hit “This is America,” although paired with original choreography by Sherrie Silver, feels unnecessary and brings the film to a grinding halt.
Another moment with “Summertime Magic” similarly removes viewers from the experience. In these moments, Glover seems to celebrate his own legacy rather than building upon it.
Many have speculated that “Guava Island” is linked to “Spirits,” Glover’s final album under the stage name Childish Gambino. 
Glover deserves all the buzz, and his influence on the entertainment industry only strengthens with each project. 
Regardless of the potential release of “Spirits,” “Guava Island” is the perfect way to get a sense of Glover’s creative mindset, even if it is only a teaser for greater things to come.

“Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power,” which debuted March 23 at The Broad, highlights the works of black artists between 1963 and 1983. Since its debut at London’s Tate Modern organized the show, the exhibit has been on display at multiple American museums before coming to Los Angeles. The multimedia exhibit incorporates painting, drawing, sculpture and even performance. The show isn’t organized chronologically, rather focusing on artistic movements and collectives like the Africobra Movement and Just Above Midtown Gallery.
“Soul of a Nation” starts by introducing viewers to the Spiral Group, a New York-based artist collective that worked from 1963 to 1965. It then moves on to highlight works from the Black Panther Movement, displaying political pamphlets and posters. These pamphlets provide social and political context for the works of art on the wall, helping viewers engage with their history as they view the gallery. 
While not every work in the show is overtly political, many of the artistic movements grew out of systemic exclusion. Many of the artists in “Soul of a Nation,” like Roy deCarava, whose black-and-white photos captured everyday life in Harlem, were traditionally excluded from museums and gallery spaces. Thus, they came together to form their own groups. 
“Couple Walking” is one of the many deCarava photographs in the exhibit that attempts to capture the most intimate everyday moments. The photo shows a couple embracing as they walk down the street, seemingly unaware of the photographer behind them. By representing the lives of black people in America, artists like deCarava seem to fill a void in the traditional Western cut history canon. 
The Broad’s presentation of “Soul of a Nation” also devotes an entire section to the works of Los Angeles-based artists, from Noah Purifoy and Betye Saar. The exhibition also provides examples of how black artists responded to mainstream artistic movements. One is a selection of paintings by Sam Gilliam and Jack Whitten, which shows how different their works are from other abstract expressionist artists like Jackson Pollock.  
The exhibit’s core strength lies in how much ground it manages to cover without cutting any corners. The show highlights artists from across the U.S., and includes over 200 works of art from more than 60 different artists. Still, the show is sectioned into nicely sized rooms, which helps viewers feel less overwhelmed by the sheer number of pieces in the exhibit. 
“Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power” runs at The Broad Museum until Sept. 1. The show costs $18 for adults and $12 for students. However, admission is free on Thursday from 5 to 8 p.m.

Sexual assault on college campuses is an epidemic and remains a pervasive problem that affects a massive cross-section of our student body. In 2015, the Association of American Universities published the results of the USC Campus Climate Survey, which shed light on the breadth and depth of this problem. A similar anonymous, private survey link was emailed to all students at the start of this month, and it is imperative that every student take a few minutes to fill this out, share their experiences and work as a member of the Trojan Family to combat sexual assault.
The statistics collected by the 2015 survey illustrated awful truths about the prevalence of sexual assault at USC. For instance, the survey results reported that a disconcerting 29.7% of female undergraduates experienced non-consensual penetration or sexual touching since entering college. Undergraduates who do not identify as male or female experienced an even higher rate, 34.2%. This data is shocking and difficult to reconcile with our image of a united and supportive student body. 
It is uncomfortable to confront these numbers, but such data are key to building momentum for solutions. In the wake of these statistics, a number of student- and administration-led initiatives have sprung up to fight sexual assault. Additional resources have been allocated for Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services as well as the Engemann Student Health Center, and campus leaders such as Interim President Wanda Austin and President-elect Carol Folt have made it a part of their mission to boldly confront sexual assault on campus.
Efforts have been made, and resources have been allocated. However, sexual assault remains a major issue in the community. Since the last campus climate survey was administered, we’ve seen controversy after controversy linked to improper sexual behavior. In 2017, a former dean of the Keck School of Medicine resigned amid allegations that he had sexually harassed a medical school fellow. In 2018, allegations against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall left deep scars in the USC community and fissured the trust of the student body. To this day, among both undergraduate and graduate students, sexual assault remains a persistent problem echoing across university life.
At a time when USC is battered by such scandals, it can be easy to feel powerless as a student. Many of us are struggling to handle midterms and papers, quickly scanning through Los Angeles Times investigative articles while keeping up with our studies. But the campus climate survey is an opportunity — a chance to share our experiences and make a concerted effort to change the University’s culture. 
Last year, I was privileged to serve as a senator in Undergraduate Student Government. While running for election, I spoke with hundreds of fellow students about what sexual assault looks like on campus in different student populations, and how pervasive the issue is. Speaking with offices like Title IX and RSVP to communicate these experiences, I found that there is a gap in our and our administration’s education and awareness of appropriate sexual behaviors. Solving this issue became a guiding mission for our team at USG.
Through a student coalition to improve visibility and education on the issue, USG founded the school’s Bystander Intervention Training Program: Trojans Act Now, an ongoing partnership with RSVP. The program received endorsements from 53 different student organizations on campus, and USG heard how sexual assault affects disparate student communities from dance teams to volunteer organizations. 
Across the board, there was a consensus that student leaders need to have a voice in reforming our community. Where the administration has struggled to educate and improve campus climate, we as students are determined to succeed. And while such efforts by campus leaders are vital to creating change, students need to make an effort as individuals as well.
In effect, this is the value of the 2019 Campus Climate Survey. The survey is an opportunity for students to drive USC’s conversation on sexual assault and share the realities of being a college student in a way that isn’t glamorized in pamphlets or at high school recruiting sessions. 
To be certain, the survey can be difficult to fill out. It may mean recounting painful memories, and the courage of survivors willing to share must be appreciated. Solving any problem first requires understanding the issue. And to contribute to this understanding is admirable. To form a comprehensive remedy, it is critical that these experiences be relayed.
The aggregated results from this survey will be made publicly available, and will drive policy at the school, state and national levels. They will guide administrative decisions on budgeting, hiring and resource distribution. More than a data point, each survey represents an experience that is shared, heard and can be equipped for advocacy and improvement at every level in our community. For the sake of your fellow students and future Trojans, please take the time to look back through your inbox and submit your responses to this survey. Help pave the way to a campus community free of sexual assault.
The confidential, individualized links were originally sent from 2019campusclimatesurvey@westat.com on April 2 to all students’ USC emails.

A few weeks before the end of every semester, I find myself standing in the 70th-floor lobby of the Wilshire Grand, looking out across the seemingly unchanging expanse of north Los Angeles. This is one of my favorite views — the Wilshire Grand is architecturally unimpressive, but the view from its 1,099-foot vantage point makes me feel small and insignificant. It reminds me that even though another semester is coming to a close, at least from this view, the skyline will remain familiar.
Part of the reason for the apparent stagnancy is the number of flat, clustered rooftops in view, each marked with a large, encircled “H.” Though I draw comfort from the dependably omnipresent helipads, L.A.’s rooftops can be repurposed for better use. With the number of development projects happening downtown, L.A. should invest in developing existing rooftops in tandem to become more sustainable, efficient and welcoming to residents.
The primary goal of the 1974 law requiring rooftop helipads was to assist in fighting skyscraper fires — particularly rescuing those trapped by fire on top floors. However, technology like automatic sprinkler systems and designated fire elevators have made these helipads nearly obsolete. 
L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti lifted the law in 2014, hoping for “a sea change for Los Angeles design,” as reported by the Los Angeles Times, but since then, not many existing rooftops have changed. In 2016 the Wilshire Grand building was topped with an 18-foot spire, in a failed attempt to add a skyline landmark, like the Seattle Space Needle or the Chicago Willis Tower. But in terms of developing the existing skyline, L.A. remains flat-topped and homogenous.
One of the ways L.A. can repurpose rooftops is by creating publicly owned private open spaces, like San Francisco and New York have done. Urban renewal policies from the ’50s pushed urban centers to be more than just workplaces. As a result, more community spaces for people to share and to live in were created. San Francisco passed the 1985 Downtown plan requiring public art spaces in new privately owned buildings or developments exceeding 25,000 square feet. Many of these spaces manifested as rooftop gardens like the Market Street Sky and Crocker Galleria terraces. 
L.A. was not as dense and populated as New York or San Francisco at the time, and didn’t need to develop these open spaces. The city was having trouble attracting people as well as retaining them. However, now that L.A.’s population has more than doubled and sidewalks downtown bustle with pedestrians commuting from their apartments to their workplaces to retail locations, the need for public spaces grows greater.
In addition to creating more public spaces, L.A. has the opportunity to use rooftops as a way to make buildings more efficient and sustainable. From solar panel installation to rainwater collection, there are lots of additions that could provide clean energy for Angelenos. 
The Shanghai Tower, a spiraling building with 128 floors, collects rainwater to be used for its air conditioning and heating systems at the top of its spiraled roof. While it doesn’t rain heavily in L.A., we have plenty of sunshine, which can be converted into energy by rooftop solar panels. Wind turbines, like those installed on the Pearl River Tower in Guangzhou, China, could also be installed.
While we have plenty of rooftop bars and restaurants, they are far outnumbered by boring, flat-topped roofs. L.A. could be more creative with its buildings, not only for the sake of the skyline aesthetic, but to also make buildings more efficient, sustainable and community-oriented.

From his inauguration in 2009 to the end of his presidency in 2017, the United States closely watched and followed former president Barack Obama and his administration. However, what most of the country didn’t see was the behind-the-scenes work done by the president’s advisory council. 
“I think the singular failure of the White House press corps covering the Obama White House was that nobody ever captured Valerie Jarrett,” said Jackie Calmes, the White House editor for the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau who moderated a discussion with former White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett at the L.A. Times Festival of Books Saturday. 
About 300 people came to Bovard Auditorium to hear Jarrett talk about her book “Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward,” which explores her journey as a daughter, mother, lawyer, senior advisor and confidante of the Obama administration, and she advises women to find their voices. 
At the event, Jarrett talked about her life before working in the White House. 
Calmes described Jarrett as “African American royalty” because of her relation to other black trailblazers. Jarrett’s father, the late James Bowman, was the first tenured black professor at the University of Chicago’s biological sciences division and was director of the university hospital’s blood bank. Her great grandfather, Robert Robinson Taylor, was the first black MIT student and first black architect in the U.S.
Another influential member of Jarrett’s family was her grandmother who they called “Puddin’” because she was “so sweet,” Jarrett said.
“She thought it was important that we appreciate our history in a sense of the sacrifices that were made by family members before us so that it would motivate us and inspire us and give us a sense of where we could go in the infinite possibilities,” Jarrett said. 
Jarrett pursued those possibilities starting with law school and eventually working as a senior White House advisor. In the introduction of her book, Jarrett describes her office at a law firm in the Sears Tower in Chicago, and how she realized she no longer wanted to work in corporate law.
“I had a spectacular view of Lake Michigan, and I loved the water, and I would sit there with my back to the door and just cry, and I thought, ‘This must be somebody else’s life. I was not meant to be this miserable,’” Jarrett said. 
Jarrett said she called a friend at this time, who told her to consider being a lawyer for the city because her clients would be the people of Chicago, and she could become a part of something bigger and more important than herself. Jarrett said this job was a stepping stone for her appointment in the Obama administration.
Jarrett said she met Michelle Obama when she interviewed Obama for a position at her law firm. She recalled this as the start of their professional relationship and friendship.
“She turned the interview around and the next thing you know, she’s asking me questions, and I don’t have answers to those questions,” Jarett said. “She appreciated at a very early age that it should be a two-way street, not just her selling, but I had to sell too.” 
Jarrett said Michelle Obama  offered her a job on the spot, even though she didn’t have the authority to do so. 
Soon after, Jarrett met Barack Obama at dinner. When she told him she was born in Iran, she received a refreshing response from him. Obama discussed his travels to Indonesia and found that they shared similar views on foreign and domestic policy. 
“The other thing we agreed upon was that we could walk into a room and find something in common with just about everybody because we were used to playing with kids who had nothing in common and yet found something in common,” Jarrett said. 
Calmes asked Jarrett about her blatant honesty in her book and why she decided to include details about her menstrual cycle and menopause. Jarrett said she wanted to be honest because a lot of people deal with the same experiences.
“I thought, in order for you to trust me, I have to be open with you,” Jarrett said. “I have to tell you the good, the bad and the ugly in order to lure you in so that when I have a very optimistic ending, which is about what you can do to empower our country to be better than it is today, that you might take that leap of faith with me.” 
Jarrett’s story touched many audience members, including some USC students who were in attendance. Sophomore Kaili Ganigan and freshman Alene Gipson went to purchase Jarrett’s book after her talk.
“My biggest takeaway would be that, to really just find what you’re passionate about and to not be afraid about the zig-zags in life and that’s where … the magic happens,” said Ganigan, who is majoring in philosophy, politics and law. 
Gipson, who is majoring in public policy, said Jarrett’s talk was intimate and conversational, but also inspiring.
“The moment the talk ended, I thought, ‘Oh, so this is what I want to be when I grow up,’” Gipson said. “Just the idea that she’s extremely influential and intelligent and she’s using that to be a good influence on the political environment without having to be this figurehead in the spotlight is so unbelievably appealing.”

After the 48 hours he was given to accept or decline the offer to buy the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong ultimately decided to go through with the purchase in June. He hoped to better local news, he said iin his talk at the paper’s annual Festival of Books. 
Soon-Shiong spoke to a crowd of 100 attendees about the future of the paper at the festival’s LA Times Main Stage on Saturday afternoon. LA Times’ executive editor Norman Pearlstine moderated the conversation. 
“It’s unfathomable for me, as a Los Angeleno, for us not to have an important paper and a voice, not just for California, but a voice for this nation,” Soon-Shiong said.  
Soon-Shiong, who now owns the Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune, is a surgeon and biotechnology billionaire known for his invention of Abraxane, a cancer-fighting drug. 
He said his work in medicine has helped him focus the Times’ mission on its audience. 
“As a physician, I say the only interest that I have to consider is the interest of the patient,” Soon-Shiong said. “I think the only interest we have to consider is the interest of the reader, not the advertiser. 
Soon-Shiong said the Times has shifted from an advertiser-dependent revenue stream to a reader-dependent revenue stream, noting that the sustainability of the paper is now dependent on paying readers. 
Pearlstine said the Times will provide value to its subscribers by doing in-depth coverage of local issues. According to Pearlsine, the paper will further emphasize coverage on topics like climate change, immigration and income inequality.
“I think a large part of what we have to do is really rededicate ourselves to coverage that other people either can’t or won’t do and to continue to do so aggressively,” Pearlstine said. “The kinds of subjects where we can identify with a local and regional audience by providing coverage that goes both deeper and broader than anyone else can do, and I think that’s where we’ll find our audience.” 
Pearlstine’s thoughts on newsworthiness were later tested by an audience member who asked if he had received the letters she had wrote him regarding unreported government torture. 
“It’s a judgement I have to make as an everyday editor, how we devote our resources,” Pearlstine said. “The letters that you sent me didn’t reach that level.” 
Soon-Shiong said he thinks the Times could have a positive effect on local government and democracy. Johnson shares that optimism with Soon-Shiong himself. 
“As an immigrant to this country living the American dream, the ability to not just give back, but in my mind, save a local paper, but also save democracy, was an opportunity,” Soon-Shiong said. ““So that’s why I did what I did.” 
Brianna Johnson, who graduated from USC last spring, said she enjoyed the talk but wants to see more coverage of local government issues in the Times. 
“[Soon-Shiong] was very inspiring,” she said. “I still think I’m kind of concerned about coverage of city halls … because that wasn’t mentioned as much, but in general I’m really happy that there’s a really optimistic feel about the LA Times right now in a way there hasn’t been in the past.”

Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton discussed her second children’s book, “Don’t Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe,” at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books Sunday. 
The book was released earlier this month and follows Clinton’s No. 1 New York Times bestselling picture book “She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World.” In conversation with LA Times columnist and culture critic Mary McNamara, Clinton discussed her journey becoming an author. 
“Being a parent … one of the things I realized was how many children’s books are told from a male perspective,” Clinton said. “Like how many of even the animal-based children’s books are told from like a male cow’s perspective, or a male frog’s perspective, or like a male duck’s perspective. [That] started to really bother me.” 
While writing her most recent book, Clinton said she asked multiple children for their input. As an animal lover herself, Clinton found that children felt similarly and wanted for that sentiment to be reflected in her book. 
“In writing books for slightly older audiences, for teenagers and preeteens and really young activists, I’ve interviewed lots and lots of kids and young people,” Clinton said. “… Two of the things I kept really hearing was how much kids are concerned about climate change and also how much kids are concerned about animals.” 
Even though the book is aimed at school-age children readers, the book is also intended to be accessible to older audiences, Clinton said. 
McNamara asked Clinton how she was able to solidify a mature yet engaging tone in the book. 
“I’m a big believer in not talking down to kids,” Clinton said. “I rely on kid readers throughout the process to give me their candid feedback.”  
Sarah Aikman, a writer and a long-time attendee of the LA Times Book Festival praised Clinton for using her platform in a positive way and inspiring people of all ages to use their voice. 
“There’s a child in all of us and … [Clinton’s books] are so accessible not just to children but to adults too,” Aikman said. “So I think there’s just something that every individual can find in them.” 
When asked about her opinion of zoos, Clinton emphasized their positive influence on society, but she also cited the specific elements that ensure zoos provide humane and safe care to create a healthy space for animals to thrive, like whether or not zoos are involved in conservation efforts in the wild and if these efforts are applied in the zoos themselves. 
“I do believe that zoos and aquariums are hugely important as educational tools and also as conservation [environments],” Clinton said. “I also think … not all zoos and aquariums are created equally.” 
McNamara then turned the conversation to children’s efforts in tackling issues often relegated to adults, asking Clinton about the role of social media in promoting youth activism. Clinton cited the use of social media in the spread of the Global Climate Strike, which was started by a young girl in Sweden and primarily led by youth protesters around the world.
“I do think we’re seeing really powerful examples of how social media is part of mobilizing young people and young people really mobilizing one another,” Clinton said. “Yet the systemic sustainable change comes from when that translates into real sustained action in the real world.” 
When asked about the world she envisions for her children, Clinton said she hopes to see a future of engaged citizens.  
“I want us to take decisive action about how we produce and consume energy,” Clinton said. “I want to live in a world where there is more dignity and respect and awareness about how we treat each other.”

USC Forward — a coalition of students, South Los Angeles residents and community leaders — began demonstrating along Jefferson Boulevard Saturday to demand accountability and transparency from the University.
Organizers set up “Tent City,” a group of 10 tents representing homelessness and the impact of gentrification in the surrounding community, outside of the University Park Campus gates. Amid the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, which brought thousands of people to campus throughout the weekend, demonstrators began camping out 24/7 on Saturday. They plan to continue the demonstration throughout the week. 
The coalition — a project of Service Employees International Union 721 — partnered with the Alliance of Californians for Community Evictions, Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice, the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, the LA Tenants Union and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
“USC, they’re a bad actor, they’re a bad neighbor,” said SEIU 721 chief-of-staff Gilda Valdez. “They don’t want to negotiate with us. In an institution that is one of the top institutions in the world, they create leaders, for them to teach them that they have no voice in their own employment, what kind of teaching is that?”
According to Department of Public Safety Assistant Chief David Carlisle, the SEIU secured a permit from the city of Los Angeles to create “Tent City” along Jefferson Boulevard. 
“We are aware that it may continue for the week,” Carlisle said. “The city of Los Angeles regulates that type of demonstration on public property, and thus far they have not created a problem for USC … We do drive by and monitor the situation, but should there become a problem, we would have LAPD’s labor relations bureau respond to arbitrate and mitigate any issues.”
Valdez said that SEIU has tried working and meeting with USC for over three years to create labor unions for University faculty; however, the school refused to budge. In a recent case involving full- and part-time non-tenure track faculty at the Roski School of Art and Design, the U.S. Court of Appeals disagreed with some of the language used in past court rulings on labor unions at universities and made it easier for employees to be considered managers who would be ineligible to unionize.
“USC defends the principle that tenured and untenured faculty are partners in shared governance,” outgoing Provost Michael Quick wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan following the court’s decision in March. “The recent court decision affirms that principle.”
Valdez said that USC could find a way to create shared governance within a union, but it does not want to relinquish its control over faculty decisions and issues. 
“This is about power and control and greed for USC, and they’re not willing to share that with their students who supposedly they’re building to be leaders in this world,” Valdez said. 
The coalition delivered a letter of the organization’s demands to President-elect Carol Folt’s office. In the letter, which was obtained by the Daily Trojan, the organization called for accessibility for low-income students, affordable housing, community benefits, campus safety and labor rights for faculty, staff and students.
“It has been a very difficult few years to be a Trojan,” the letter read. “As the incoming president, you have the opportunity to change the toxic culture and narrative surrounding our school — not through superficial house cleaning of bad actors, but through genuine, foundational and transformational changes to the way this university functions as both an educational institution and essential piece of the fabric of Southern California.”
During Sunday’s demonstration, organizers held a listening session for attendees to voice their grievances with the University. Former California Senate Pro Tempore Kevin de León sat down with attendees to discuss the importance of community engagement and commitment. 
“I’d be more than happy to [help],” de León said. “I’ve always been a fighter for working families, all the time.”
ACCE co-director Joe Delgado is currently staying in one of the tents along Jefferson Boulevard to protest gentrification and evictions in the surrounding area caused by developments made by the University. Residents on Flower Drive and Exposition Boulevard have faced evictions as a result of expansions in student housing. 
He said that local residents are being pushed out of their homes by companies that want to create more opportunities for off-campus student housing options, so they can charge higher rates. 
“The tents are a symbol of the poverty that surrounds this campus,” Delgado said. “If you go three blocks in any direction, it’s the reality that our folks live with everyday, and the truth is that every time student housing goes up in and around the area landlords around the area see that they can charge $2,000 per unit and then look to evict the working folks that live in the area.”
A member of ACCE who goes by “Karin” discussed the problem of rising rents and gentrification, which she attributes to the creation of USC Village and the rising cost of student housing in the neighborhood.
Karin, who lives in the city’s 9th Council District, said her landlord has tried to evict her four times in order to charge future tenants higher rent.  
“With housing, it’s very sad the way everything is becoming,” Karin said. “As part of the 9th district, the owner of the house has tried to evict me four times … There is the risk that any minute he can do something like that and of course I would not like to end up on the street, especially like the people in Harbor Heights [and] Mid-City.”
Karin also discussed the importance of USC reaching out to students in neighboring schools and promoting equal access to affordable higher education.
“It’s very hard for [our children] to dream to come to the University when the tuition is all the way to the moon and our salaries very low,” Karin said. “And I feel like we should do something to avoid that. We have great children, and they are as smart as anyone. We just don’t have the accessibility.”
De León said USC must work with community leaders and local high school students to ensure equal access to resources. 
“When it comes to access to higher education, whether it’s a public institution like the University of California, the Cal State University system, or a private nonprofit independent academic and research university, like USC, access to those who are socioeconomically marginalized is critical,” de León said. “Our kids, and kids in poor neighborhoods, are just as smart as any other kids but they don’t have the same opportunity. So it’s an opportunity gap that exists and manifests.”
Shany Ebadi, a junior majoring in political science who attended USC Forward’s press conference Saturday, said she has been working with the organization since last fall with a focus on the intersectionality of issues related to sexual assault and student safety.
“We came to emphasize the importance of intersectionality of all the issues that are affecting both students and the community,” Ebadi said. “The racism, the sexism, the classicism is all tied into one another, and as you saw with the list of demands today, they are really all connected and you can’t target them one at a time.”
Ebadi said she hopes the University will listen to the demands of the coalition and work to increase accountability among students and the community.
“They are sleeping on the streets for five nights to ensure that their message is being heard and demanding the administration to be held accountable and listen to these stories,” Ebadi said.
