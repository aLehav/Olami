If you know anything about me, you probably know about my natural infatuation with Lee Know, my favorite K-pop idol, and my utter dislike for superhero movies. Admittedly, the latter is a hot take, but it’s one I’ve stood by since high school. The movies can be unbearably long and confusing, but I think what annoys me the most is the cult followings that these franchises always seem to garner. 
I know I’m definitely in the minority for feeling this way. My family knows not to ask if I’ve seen the latest Marvel movie because they already know the answer, and my friends laugh at me when I don’t understand their common pop culture references. But in the past, I remained unbothered.
In fact, it’s not until recently that I’ve started to wish I understood these movies — naturally, this desire stemmed from K-pop. 
Last April, my favorite K-pop group, Stray Kids, participated on the Mnet competition show “Kingdom: Legendary War” alongside five other boy groups, all tasked with creating original performances of both their own songs and covers of other artists. The performances were ranked based on four criteria: a self-ranking by the groups themselves, evaluations by industry professionals, global fan votes and the YouTube view counts of the performances. 
Because of the significant impact viewers had on the show’s performance evaluation process, fans of participating groups were understandably invested in not only streaming their favorite artist’s performance videos themselves but also promoting the videos to as many people as possible — whether they were fans of the group or not. 
So, when Stray Kids performed their rendition of BLACKPINK’s “DDU-DU DDU-DU,” filled with references to Marvel’s “Deadpool,” including member Felix opening the stage in a Deadpool costume and breaking the fourth wall by conversing with the audience, STAY — the group’s fandom — had no issue accumulating views on the performance video from within the Stray Kids fanbase, the BLACKPINK fanbase and, most significantly, the wider Marvel fanbase. The performance video remains the most viewed of every performance from the entire competition, with over 30 million views during time of publication.
The video even caught the attention of Deadpool himself, with Ryan Reynolds interacting with Stray Kids leader Bang Chan on Twitter, referring to him as his “#NewFavouriteAustralian,” a lighthearted jab at “Wolverine” actor Hugh Jackman. Both would even go on to mail each other autographed merchandise — a Stray Kids album from Bang Chan and a bottle of American Aviation gin from Reynolds.
The exchange didn’t go unnoticed by STAY, and for good reason. Marvel is the most successful Hollywood film franchise in history, grossing over $22 billion at the global box office as of September 2021. The impact of major players in the Marvel franchise such as Reynolds and Jackman essentially promoting Stray Kids is exponentially larger than what any fanbase could do on its own. 
Since the performance and subsequent exposure from Reynolds and Jackman, Stray Kids’ album sales have steadily climbed over their following two releases — their latest mini-album, “ODDINARY,’’ sold over 1.3 million pre-order copies. Reynolds himself promoted the mini-album on his Instagram story Friday, the day of its release, to the excitement of STAY around the world. 
“ODDINARY” also included cues to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — something that correlated with Reynolds’ promotion, which he didn’t give to the group’s prior release which had no references to the MCU. The music video for title track “MANIAC” includes a visual reference to the Mirror Dimension, and the music video for B-side track “VENOM” includes imagery of spiders and parasites.
These subtle allusions to a film franchise with such a following are not only fascinating but also extremely strategic. By reimagining content from the MCU, people who follow Marvel but not necessarily Stray Kids are given a reason to check out the group’s music, which in theory, would result in the group gaining even more fans outside of their typical demographic. 
The use of “concepts” in K-pop — general visual references and running themes in a group’s music video, costuming and set design throughout an album promotion — is nothing new, with groups commonly using concepts like school (see BTS’s “Boy in Luv” or STAYC’s “ASAP”) and racing (TREASURE’s “JIKJIN” or CRAVITY’s “My Turn”). However, it’s Stray Kids’ monopolization of such a distinctive concept, with an even more significant following, that truly sets them apart and establishes their strategy as one other groups should aim to follow. 
In an industry dominated by the competition to consistently stand out in order to attract new fans, it is clear that Stray Kids is already a step ahead. As out of character as it may seem, I know I’d join their cult following in a heartbeat — perhaps I already have.

Ah, spring. Flowers are blooming, insects are swarming, the sun is shining — and, of course, your allergies are acting up again.
Is there anything good about the seasonal snuffles? At least they provide a good excuse when you bawl over the following movies. Don’t be embarrassed, these classic works of anime are fine-tuned with stunning landscapes and fantastic narratives to tug at your every tear duct … or maybe it’s just the pollen.
“When Marnie Was There” (2015) 
This particular Studio Ghibli film warrants some extra appreciation for its intricate depiction of identity and growing up. Anna (Hailee Steinfeld) has a hard time getting along with classmates. Concerned about Anna’s asthma attacks, her aunt and uncle invite her to stay with them for the summer in a small country town where she encounters Marnie (Kieran Shipka), a girl that lives in an old mansion across the marsh. Befriending Marnie, Anna gradually realizes that the mysterious girl is closer to her than she expected. The truths unveiled in Anna’s journey of self-discovery pose tender and relatable questions about family and home, especially in the midst of growing up.
Resulting symptoms: 
•  Randomly strong desires to take a vacation in a rural town that happens to have old mansions.
• (Unfortunately) remembering what you may or may not have been like during your twelve year old  emo phase.
“Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms” (2018) 
The immortal versus mortal trope. Maquia (Manaka Iwami), a girl of the mystical lorph race, is caught in a war on her people when she finds a human infant amid the destruction. Despite being a child herself, she’s touched by his helplessness and raises him as her son. But the tensions between the lorph and human race complicate the boy, Ariel (Miyu Irino) and Maquia’s relationship, eventually splitting them apart. “Maquia” comments on the notion of immortality and the complications that arise therein and the importance of family, blood related or not. 
Resulting symptoms:
• Frequent,  deep  and  long sighs of resignation.
• Prickling, teary eyes for the next 10 business days.
“Violet Evergarden: the Movie” (2020) 
Now, this is technically the finale of a TV series, but what’s the unpredictable Los Angeles spring for if not cuddling up inside and binging a whole series in a few days? Violet Evergarden (Yui Ishikawa) is an orphan and former child soldier who assimilates into postwar society by working at a postal company as a letter writer, hoping to ultimately discover the meaning of love. Encountering different types of clients, she improves in her writing skills as time passes. Yet, Violet still holds onto the hope that her beloved commanding officer, who was declared missing-in-action, is still alive. The science fiction elements contrast with the characters’ haunting regrets to evoke a heart wrenching reflection of the difficulty in striving toward a better future. 
Resulting symptoms:
•   Emotional contagion   
•   Compulsions to write to a(n) (imaginary) long lost lover
“In This Corner of the World” (2016)
In Hiroshima, Japan, newly married Suzu (Rena Nōnen) navigates life before and during World War II. Facing the daily loss of subsistence and supplies, she must help her family survive wartime. Amid the destruction and fast-paced changes, Suzu struggles to stay alive and define her ability to protect her family. When the war threatens to destroy everything that she treasures, the hope for the future is all she can rely on. “In This Corner of the World” puts into perspective the value of small, trivial moments of life amid chaos. 
Resulting symptoms:
•  Furiously red eyes
•  Irreversably runny nose
“A Silent Voice” (2016) 
We all know a bully story or two. But this one explores the cruel reality from the bully’s perspective, and the labels that constrained and tore them apart. In grade school, Shoya Ishida (Miyu Irino) bullied Shoko Nishimiya (Saori Hayami), who is hard of hearing, to the point that she had to transfer. What made him hate her so much that he’d do and say terrible things? Years later in high school, Shoya decides to befriend Shoko to take accountability for his deeds. However, it won’t be simple to soothe the wounds inflicted that also affected their classmates and families. Combating the concept of a social survival of the fittest by encouraging the ups and downs of communication, “A Silent Voice” reinforces what listening and seeing those surrounding us, and how our worlds are shaped by what we choose to hear and see. 
Resulting symptoms:
•  Searching for signs of luck
•  More emotional contagion
If you’re the type of person who becomes easily invested in fictional characters, or if you experience any of the aforementioned symptoms, blame it on the pollen content. Or, since we’re in L. A., the air quality. You totally didn’t ugly cry — we won’t tell.

“The Lost City,” directed by Adam Nee and Aaron Nee, is incredibly campy. That over-the-top nature is what makes the film so entertaining, as it offers lighthearted fun while maintaining a clear and cohesive narrative arc.
The film stars Sandra Bullock as Loretta Sage, a romance novelist who’s withdrawn from society after the death of her husband. Loretta’s publicist Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) organizes a book tour to promote Loretta’s romance adventure novels. At one of the events, Loretta effectively kills her career by declaring that she intends to have Dash, the male hero of her beloved novels, die.
Shortly after the event, Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a villainous billionaire who seeks her help to find a lost island city that she previously researched with her late husband. Loretta’s taken to the jungle, and Alan, the cover model of Loretta’s romance novels who secretly has a crush on her, ventures to the jungle to help save her. He wants to prove that he’s more than the superficial, unintelligent cover model she sees him as. The two end up on a chaotic journey to find the lost city — Loretta’s longtime dream — and find a way to go home. 
While certainly comedic, the movie’s main concern is blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. The protagonist being a romance author lends “The Lost City” a wonderful meta quality, where Loretta finds herself embroiled in an adventure worthy of her own novels. It’s an exciting adventure in the jungle, one of great heights and great sights.
The real stunners of the film, though, are Bullock and Tatum, who elevate their characters compellingly and make them more complex than comedic. What could have been a simple parody of romance novels turns into a serious critique of why they’re so shunned despite their value.
Of course, one can’t ignore the more delightful moments of humor too. One memorable part is when Alan has to convince Loretta that he’s more than just her romance novel cover model and that she shouldn’t “judge a book by its cover.” The dialogue is witty and fast, managing to convey the deep internal feelings and personality of each character while making the audience laugh. It could be exhausting trying to send a grandiose message about looking deeper below the surface, but somehow Bullock and Tatum manage to pull it all off with stunning comedic charm and timing.
It also helps that, as a romantic comedy, the film leans into popular tropes of the genre — having to share a hammock together and the awkward tension that ensues being one of them — but also realizes that there’s a reason why audiences are so drawn to such tropes. Sure, the filmmakers poke fun at those tropes a bit. “The Lost City” is full of cringe-worthy smolders and, at one point, an exaggerated enactment of a romance novel’s writing style. 
Yet within the film lies some authentically sweet moments, such as a dance between Loretta and Alan or when Alan tells Loretta not to dismiss her novels as frivolous junk when there are people who appreciate them. The latter is a surprising moment in a film centered around the seeming silliness of romance stories. Somehow, that gives “The Lost City” more nuance, as if the filmmakers are reminding the audience that there’s a reason for seeing this movie.
It has to be said that “The Lost City” is a self-referential work, which means that it’s both aware of its romantic appeal and reliving what makes romance so appealing in the first place. The heroes — Loretta and Alan — have to fight off physical obstacles in the jungle that prevent them from getting together and emotional obstacles. 
There’s also some well-developed character development that occurs for the two. Loretta learns to emotionally process her grief for her husband and to enjoy the rest of what life might have in store. Alan conveys to Loretta that, although he’s not the fictional hero of her novels, he can be heroic in his own unexpected way.
Like what could be said of all films, it’s not flawless: Parts of the external conflict with Fairfax feels contrived just to add more action, and a few of the scenes between Loretta and Alan seem redundant. However, those aspects are easily overlooked in considering the story’s depth.  
Maybe what makes “The Lost City” work so well is its ability to engage what audiences want while questioning those constructs. It’s about uncovering the stories that might be lost, but also, cheesily enough, finding the strength to tell your own.
Rating: 4/5

It’s almost that time again: Spring. You can already feel the temperatures rising, along with your daily amount of serotonin. No longer trapped by the dreary, windy and cold days of winter, it’s time to begin dreaming of summer and a break from school. To prepare for studying under the sun on the warm grass of Alumni Park instead of the soul-sucking fluorescents of Leavey’s basement, you’re gonna need a great playlist. 
Not just great — you need something unique. It’s time to impress your stuffy Thornton crush this semester. Here are some eccentric album recommendations to prepare for a wonderful spring full of growth and rejuvenation.
For the flower (or pothos!) in you, ready to bloom: “Mother Earth’s Plantasia” by Mort Garson
Possibly the album most representative of spring, this 1970s synth-fest was crafted by legendary composer Mort Garson specifically for plants. Yes, you read that right. This project was born from the very ’70s idea that Garson’s synth grooves would cause plants to spontaneously grow. Thank god it happened because this album is some of the most scrumptious music you’ll ever treat yourself to.
There’s a song for every mood on the album, from the swirling tones of “Swingin’ Spathiphyllums” to the moody closer “Music to Soothe the Savage Snake Plant,” so curl up next to your favorite houseplant and let the music help the both of you grow.
For when you inevitably decide to skip class in favor of soaking up the rays: “Skylarking” by XTC
We’ve all been there — sometimes. The call of the sun is just too strong to resist. XTC, apparently, also felt that call on its ninth album. Vibe out with your friends to the catchy “That’s Really Super, Supergirl,” then contemplate your existence on the beautiful, pleading closer “Dear God.” The lead single, “Grass,” will make you blush when you take a closer look at the lyrics, but overall this classic psychedelic pop record will make any delightful spring day just a little bit better.
For heading to the beach on the weekend, but having a dance party on the sand because the water is still too cold: “Mercurial World” by Magdalena Bay
Ah, good ol’ Southern California, with its beautiful beaches and startlingly cold water. Still, in order to “casually” fill your Instagram with your best angles when you and a couple of friends hop on the Metro to Santa Monica, you need a soundtrack that’s as cool as you are. 
That’s where the new Magdalena Bay album comes in; released in 2021, it’ll have you feeling as vibrant and fun as the tracks themselves. From the party-ready closer “The Beginning” to the slick and funky “Secrets (Your Fire),” Magdalena Bay blends synthpop, EDM, hyperpop and more to create an album that lifts you up and makes you feel light and free.
For a gorgeous botanical garden date: “Timely!!” by Anri
Japanese city pop is nothing if not infectious, as Anri’s masterpiece of an album proves. The tunes flow freely, with hits like “DRIVING MY LOVE” and “CAT’S EYE – (NEW TAKE)” both full of energetic music and lyrics. You don’t need to know Japanese to understand these songs — the groovy beats and Anri’s beautiful voice speak for themselves. This is sure to be a stunner on any date. Just let the timeless ’80s sound whisk you away to somewhere sunny and beautiful as you spend time with someone you love.
For anticipating finals season with dread: “Either/Or” by Elliott Smith
The 25th anniversary of this landmark album passed recently, but now’s as good a time as ever to get into Elliott Smith. Named by Phoebe Bridgers as a key influence and inspiration of hers, Smith’s music is both depressing and filled with a lightness that can’t be put into words. Songs like the passionate “Ballad of Big Nothing” contrast well with Smith’s softer, more listless tracks like “Punch and Judy.” 
Smith’s music feels like sinking into the sun-warmed sand of an empty beach or walking through the redwoods of Yosemite, dwarfed by towering trees and a heavy silence. However, the singer-songwriter style and acoustic guitar playing match the mellow tranquility of a day spent doing nothing but studying, as much as you’d like to be doing anything else. Smith was a master of his craft, and as the final notes of the closing track, “Say Yes,” fade out, you’ll find the only thing you want to do is queue up the album again and sink back into its warm, melancholy embrace.

In 1986, the USC School of Architecture inherited a historic mansion in Hollywood Hills after the passing of Harriet Press Freeman. The property, initially erected as a structural experiment by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1924, would later transform into an urban laboratory and a home for the avant-garde under the ownership of the Freemans.
Now, almost 100 years old, the home faces deteriorating structural integrity that demands attention. In light of the ongoing challenges in maintaining the home, USC finalized the sale of the Frank Lloyd Wright Freeman House Feb. 24. 
The University ensured that the home’s rich history will be preserved under the ownership of Richard E. Weintraub, president and CEO of the Weintraub Real Estate Group, according to a USC statement sent to the Daily Trojan. 
Harriet Freeman, the house’s first proprietor, was a dancer and leading figure in the avant-garde movement of the early 1920s. When she and her husband Sam Freeman commissioned Wright to build with textile blocks, experimental construction methods and innovative design elements, she intended to use the space as more than just a home — she would create a modern Bohemian center, a hotspot for the artistic and radical.
Colleagues in the avant-garde community, including choreographer Martha Graham, photographer Edward Weston and band leader Xavier Cuga, stayed with the Freemans, often putting on performances and showcasing their art. Eventually, the home became a political safe haven for those persecuted during the McCarthy era.
“During the McCarthy era [blacklists] when actors … suspected of being communists were losing their job or forced to go to Washington to testify, Harriet and Sam not only let their wives or families stay in the house, but she would do exercise and dance classes to keep them busy,” said Jeffery Chusid, associate professor of Architecture at Cornell University and author of “Saving Wright: The Freeman House and the Preservation of Meaning, Materials, and Modernity,” published in 2011.
In addition to actors and artists, the Freemans also housed and supported important political leaders and civil rights activists, including Congressman Augustus F. Hawkins, one of the first Black representatives in L.A.’s history.
The house’s rich history of art, politics and the avant-garde continued through the 20th century until the house was gifted to the University after Harriet Freeman’s passing in 1986. Since then, the University has used the home as an educational asset for the School of Architecture, permitting students and faculty to tour the house — or in Chusid’s case, live in it for over 13 years. Starting as a tenant in 1985 and later overseeing the home after Harriet’s death, Chusid studied the experimental architecture of the home while delving into its rich historical background in “Saving Wright”.
“Frank Lloyd Wright made a very rich environment full of experiences, like walking into rooms that have suddenly burst into light, walking down hallways that are very dark and dramatic,” Chusid said. “You could stand in the living room and tell what time of day it was and what day of the year it was because of the way the sunlight came through the clear stories and cast light on the walls.”
From its stunning exterior and the intricate glasswork to the gorgeous view of the City of Stars, this historic piece of architectural art was a transformational experience for those able to visit. However, with the passage of time came issues concerning the structural efficacy of the home that the University didn’t expect.
“The house was deteriorating, sometimes slowly and sometimes more quickly,” said Chusid, who used his experience in the home to embark on a path of preservation of architecture. “First the Whittier earthquake and then the Northridge earthquake.”
The unique construction of the property challenged USC’s ability to keep up with repairs. 
“The school has never had the means to really maintain it the way it needed to be maintained,” said Kenneth Breisch, associate professor of architecture at USC. “It’s a difficult house … because of the earthquakes, but also, there’s a lot of water damage because the concrete blocks are very porous and rods are rusting — it needs a lot of tender loving care.”
Weintraub plans to fully renovate the home under the conditions of the preservation easement, said the Director of USC Museums Bethany Montagano, who has consulted on the Freeman House over the last year.
“The conservation easement, which will be held by the L.A. Conversancy, protects and preserves character defining features of the property in perpetuity,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “With the addition of the Freeman House, the Conservancy now will have three textile block houses by either Frank Lloyd Wright or Lloyd Wright in its collection.” 
The conditions of the sale also guarantee the public has access to the Freeman House four times a year. Proceeds from the sale will go toward educational programming for the USC School of Architecture.
“Maintaining academic access in partnership with the new owner who will restore the home is a benefit to everyone,” Montagano said. “The USC School of Architecture has worked arm in arm with national and regional experts to identify an owner who will fully restore, preserve and conserve the home and bring it into full use again.”

Jeff Bezos is, quite literally, the second richest person on Earth. Worth $189.2 billion as the CEO of Amazon, Bezos visited campus Feb. 22 and was met by President Carol Folt around the  University Park Campus.
While USC has notoriously accepted money for controversial reasons — for example, the Varsity Blues scandal — Jeff Bezos’s visit sends mixed messages to USC students about the power of wealth. Folt does not go out of her way to escort prospective families and students, yet Bezos was treated to a special visit from her while on campus.
USC, a school that prides itself on its sustainability efforts, committed to carbon neutrality by the year 2025. However, Bezos was treated with incredible respect by the administration, despite criticisms about his lack of effort to combat the climate crisis. 
While he has committed to donate $10 billion to fight climate change, Amazon is far from a stellar example of a sustainable business model. Not only did Greenpeace find Amazon guilty of breaking its commitment to 100% renewable energy, but Gizmodo, in 2019, noticed that “Amazon has begun a targeted campaign to win oil, gas, and coal business.” Amazon Prime, a service that is incredibly efficient at providing customers with their purchased goods, is an unsustainable practice that “creates more vehicles, more traffic, and potentially more emissions.” 
Prime Day, an event in which consumers are encouraged to purchase more from Amazon for less, exemplifies unsustainable business practices. Customers are promised two-day delivery and often fail to consolidate their products in one order, causing more stops for delivery trucks and greater carbon emissions.
It should also be noted that the Board of Amazon rejected the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice’s climate proposals, a suspicious move that gives more insight into the company’s priorities. The proposals urged Amazon to treat its employees fairly when climate change creates “extreme weather events” that foster unsafe working conditions, to create goals that coincide with science — specifically the IPCC report — and to move away entirely from the employment of fossil fuels, among other demands. 
However, it is clear that Amazon is not a corporation that values its workers, much less their insights. In 2021, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama attempted to unionize unsuccessfully, claiming that Amazon used intimidation tactics and illegally forced the vote to unionize in its favor. Amazon is a company with less than stellar working conditions for its employees, even amid the coronavirus pandemic, so much so that public health experts urged the company to improve its working environment. Not only did Amazon report nearly 20,000 coronavirus cases in the fall 2020 but additionally “reported 24,505 serious injuries … in 2020,”  according to federal data as of 2021.
Workers are rightfully unhappy with Amazon. As reported by Forbes, “Workers alleged that they are given back-breaking tasks in the warehouses.” Additionally, workers are unhappy with heavy surveillance by cameras and similar tracking technology while they work, creating an environment of insecurity and discomfort. As a campus that has student workers and has received its own complaints about unfair labor practices like low wages and little benefits, it is not the best look to show reverence to the CEO of a company that has exploited workers.
Bezos has name recognition and power, but that does not make him any better or more valuable than other people touring USC. In fact, many other families who tour USC have incredible accomplishments, but whether it is because of their lack of power or non-billionaire status — or both — they are not greeted or shown around campus by the University President.
Bezos has undeniably created change with Amazon but has also had negative impacts on its workers, the environment and the wealth disparity of the United States. So, what message is USC sending students by giving Jeff Bezos such preferential treatment on campus? The message seems to be a clear one: Wealth is power, and power warrants respect. It does not seem to matter that the actions of Bezos do not align with USC’s advertised values. What matters is enormous capital and status. USC students deserve better than this message.

Back home in Florida, I enrolled in arts magnet programs for both middle and high school where most of my friends were queer. I lived in a rainbow bubble full of performers and creators who understood all of my Nicki Minaj and Jennifer Coolidge references. Everyone watched “Glee,” and all of my friends could easily list the Jonas Brothers in order of hotness.
College has been a vastly different experience. I have somehow found myself with more straight, cisgender friends than LGBTQIA ones — despite living in Los Angeles, one of the most progressive and creative cities in the world. There is only one thing that can turn my new cardinal and gold bubble rainbow: yassification.
NBC News defines yassifying as “beautifying something, typically something that is unappealing or heteronormative.” Urban Dictionary user “certified twink” more eloquently states that yassification is the “act of making someone or something gayer or more girlboss.” Regardless of which definition you find more appropriate, one thing is for sure — to yassify something is to improve it. 
According to a recent Gallup poll, a “record 7.1% of U.S. adults self-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or something other than heterosexual.” This statistic may seem small, but it is a stark increase from the 5.6% found in the same survey the prior year. Plus, the 7.1% only accounts for those who admitted to being LGBTQIA in the survey — and, speaking from experience, discovering and labeling your identity can be a long and confusing process.
Simply put, the world is changing, and I fear that those who remain un-yassified may be left behind. It’ll be like the Rapture but set to the soundtrack of Charli XCX’s “Vroom Vroom” EP. Luckily, I have compiled some tips for how to yassify your friends — and save them from doom — based on my own experiences at USC thus far. 
1. Take your straight friends to a midnight screening of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975). 
One of my favorite theaters in Los Angeles, The Nuart, hosts a screening of the iconic movie-musical with a shadow cast every other week. “Rocky Horror” is an interactive, raunchy film and live theater experience. It’s nearly impossible to leave a screening without having been fully yassified.
2. Bring your hetero homies out for a night on the town in WeHo. 
West Hollywood, known by the gays lovingly as “WeHo,” is home to countless LGBTQIA establishments, including shops, restaurants and nightclubs. I do not condone underage drinking, but for those of age, I have heard through the grapevine that The Bayou serves jello shots in syringes that are sure to yassify your friends’ bloodstreams. 
3. Offer unsolicited fashion advice. 
It’s okay to critique your friend’s khaki shorts and Vineyard Vines T-shirt! They are in their early 20s — they should know better. In all seriousness, L.A. can be a difficult place to keep up with the ever-changing fashion trends. Take your friends shopping for some cheap rings and bling at the Melrose Trading Post or teach them how to french tuck. With style comes yassification. 
4. Over time, recommend your friends new songs that become increasingly chaotic and queer. 
Start out with something gentle that can appeal to everyone, like Phoebe Bridgers or Lorde. After easing them in, go full throttle by recommending the likes of late hyperkinetic pop legend SOPHIE or Artpop era Lady Gaga. Next thing you know, they’ll be clubbing with you at TigerHeat!
Yassification, albeit appearing light-hearted and mindless at its surface, is a powerful tool the LGBTQIA community can use to normalize queerness. The trend brings queer trends to the table in a digestible way — straight, cisgender people will likely react more openmindedly to jokingly being told they are being “yassified” than they would to adopting queer cultural attributes. 
USC, like most historic institutions, has a predominantly straight, cisgender and white population. It can be difficult to drift away from heteronormative ideals without a tool like yassification. Hopefully, the above simple tips will help you effectively yassify your friends and loved ones. So far, they have helped me curate a much gayer and more girlboss social circle — and I have felt all the more fulfilled.

Oct. 10, 2017: The final whistle sounds, and the United States Men’s National Team players drop to the ground in defeat after failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. A younger Adam Jasper, along with his two brothers, do just the same in their living room. We all cried that night. 
Today: The USMNT is on the verge of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, with three final fixtures against Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica for all the marbles. Ahead of the games, I thought it would be worthwhile to reflect on the USMNT’s journey in the form of an open letter from my present-day self to Adam Jasper from that fateful fall night in 2017:
Dear Adam,
First and foremost, I know it hurts. I’m sad to report that you’re gonna have to live with it for a while, longer than you would like to think. In fact, you won’t ever forget this night.
Yes, you just witnessed the worst 90 minutes of soccer that you will ever watch. Thankfully, the players that you’re infuriated with right now? Many of them won’t be around too much longer. A lot is going to change — let me fill you in. 
You’re gonna have to sit through some turmoil. Bruce Arena is going to step down as manager, and a guy named Gregg Berhalter is going to take the reins. He’s a Jordan-wearing, behind-the-back passing menace on the sideline, and he’s got the flair you’ve wanted in a USMNT manager for a while. That being said, I’m not sold on him just yet, as his tactics and team selection have been suspect to say the least. These upcoming games could very well decide his fate. 
One of the few surviving players from the team you just watched is, unsurprisingly, Christian Pulisic. He’s on your favorite club team now, and he’s become your favorite player. Pulisic’s got a bright future, and he’s already had some unforgettable moments that I’m certain you’ll be excited to witness.
But, unlike your current time period, Pulisic isn’t the only player to be excited about. You won’t believe me, but the majority of the USMNT starting eleven now plays in top European leagues. They’re calling it the “golden generation” of United States soccer. 
Tim Weah, Weston McKennie, Giovanni Reyna, Brenden Aaronson, Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Yunus Musah, Tyler Adams, Ricardo Pepi — I can say with confidence that every single one of those players has a very bright future with the team. You’ll learn who they are and to love them. They’re the future of this nation’s soccer aspirations. 
The team has accomplished a lot so far, but getting back to the World Cup for the first time since 2014 is the ultimate goal — it always has been, ever since the failure in Trinidad and Tobago that you just witnessed. 
The job is not done. The U.S. needs 5 points to essentially guarantee qualification, and 4 points gives them a very good chance at qualifying. It’s looking increasingly likely that today’s team will end up in a similar position to the team you just watched, needing at least a point going into the final match. 
Ahead of the most important games the USMNT has played since 2017, players are dropping like flies. McKennie, Dest and Aaronson will all miss the final window with various injuries. I’m scared that the stars are aligned, that history is doomed to repeat itself, that I’ll end up on the floor like you are right now. 
And, now, you’re all caught up. Now, our beloved national team is on the brink of success or failure once again. I’m very nervous. I can’t stop thinking about where you are, heartbroken and crying in the face of immeasurable frustration. That’s why I’m writing to you. 
In the midst of a lot of anxiety, let me present you with a note of optimism, a shining glimmer of hope. There’s one big thing that makes this time different from last: They’ve already failed before. These players, this team, this nation knows the pain that you’re feeling all too well, and everyone’s desperate to replace it with joy. The memory is burned in the back of the players’ minds, and I have a feeling they have what it takes to avoid another failure. 
No matter how the results shape up, I recognize how much of a privilege it has been to be a part of the USMNT’s journey. I know you’ll enjoy every up and down, all of the pageantry that makes the sport beautiful. For now, pick yourself up and wipe those tears, kid. You should be so excited for what’s in store. 
Believe, 
Adam Jasper

Maggie Bowen, founder of Aunt Skatie, began her skateboarding journey after her mother mistakenly gave her a skateboard for Christmas — instead of the longboard she asked for — when she was just eight years old. 
Arriving at USC in 2018, Bowen began to explore all that skateboarding had to offer. During her freshman year, Bowen met with a group of friends from her floor and a male skater who proceeded to invite her to go with him to a skate park. 
During the meetup, Bowen said she primarily helped the skater record his tricks.
“He was super cool for taking me there to the park, and we had a great day, but he was also kind of like ‘I want you to film me,’” said Bowen, now a senior majoring in narrative studies. “Because I was a beginner, he was like, ‘I don’t want to waste my time teaching you. I just want to get clips and leave.’ And so I was kind of bummed out about that.” 
According to a Los Angeles Times article highlighting USC’s research on the activity, skateboarding has proven to be life changing for many,  allowing for community, stress relief and collaboration. Despite generally being considered a welcoming space, the sport’s benefits can often be clouded for underrepresented groups and LGBTQIA skaters who find difficulty in navigating the cis-male dominated space.  
Zoë Corwin, a research professor and primary contributor to the USC Skate Studies research team — a project dedicated to exploring the experiences, hardships and day-to-day lives of skaters — notes this disconnect. 
“[White cis-gendered men] have a belief that skateboarding is open to everyone — ‘You skate, I skate, we’re all the same. I have no issue with you being part of my skate world,’” Corwin said. “But that’s not necessarily experienced the same way by someone who has a marginalized identity.” 
Despite Bowen feeling underestimated during her experience with the male skater, she defines that point as when she took skating more seriously, spending the following summer perfecting her craft.
The next semester, Bowen founded Aunt Skatie, an organization dedicated to providing a safe space for women, LGBTQ+ and non-binary skaters to feel motivated in an environment that they could call their own. Inspired by her involvement in Girls Who Code — where she served as a teacher’s assistant for the group’s summer immersion program — Bowen looked to translate the organization’s mission to the skateboarding realm.
“I loved Girls Who Code’s mission of ‘Be brave, not perfect.’ … There’s less of that fear of failure and more resilience,” Bowen said. “I wanted that in skateboarding because I would go to the park and would see like no girls.” 
Aunt Skatie’s name stems from when Bowen found relief in seeing another girl, Katie Korneta, at the Wilson Skate Park in Chicago. Korneta, a professional baker and community organizer who coordinates skating sessions and competitions, would later invite her to compete in an all-girls competition that Bowen described as having “magnetic energy.” Bowen also uses Aunt Skatie’s name to pay homage to her Aunt Katie. 
Unaffiliated with USC, the group had to find creative ways to spread the word about Aunt Skatie. During this time, Bowen could often be found frantically chasing down potential members on Trousdale Parkway, handing out flyers about the organization’s first meetup. 
Despite the difficulties that arise from Aunt Skatie’s non-affiliation, Bowen enjoys the freedom that comes with it. 
“We don’t have to fill out a ton of paperwork. We’re not limited by the University in what we can do and say,” Bowen said. “And it’s not just limited to that population … There are people that are outside USC that have joined.”
Since then, the organization has grown to roughly 30 members, with some of the early members of Aunt Skatie continuing to stay actively involved.  
Danielle Haase, a first-year graduate student studying neuroscience, joined Aunt Skatie in its first year as a junior after she and her friend discovered the organization on Instagram. Haase credits Aunt Skatie for building up her confidence, particularly with her skating abilities. 
“I would not have gone to a skate park before Aunt Skatie,”  Haase said. “When I had [gone] in the past, it was just all these men, and I felt scared to even throw down my board because I felt like I didn’t deserve to take up that space … But it’s a lot easier to take up that space when you’re in a group of  people who are similar to you and are encouraging you.” 
One of Haase’s most solidified memories with Aunt Skatie involved inviting a young girl to join their group after noticing she was skating alone.  
“A bunch of the Aunt Skatie girls were trying to include her a lot, and we started a train with all of us skating around the park with her. It was really cute.” Haase said. 
In contrast, skaters such as Pilar Luiz, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, recently joined Aunt Skatie, attending her first meetup in mid-February. Luiz said she already recognizes Aunt Skatie’s role in allowing marginalized groups to truly feel seen in the sport they participate in. 
“A lot of times, we fall into the narratives perpetuated by societal standards, which is white males skateboarding,” Luiz said. “Aunt Skatie is offering a new narrative for minorities,  females and LGBTQ+ communities and presenting a possibility that you can be a part of this narrative and not excluded from it.” 
Although Luiz acknowledges that people who look to start skating may feel intimidated, she urges new skaters to look past their fears. 
“Everyone feels intimidated. I feel intimidated. But I’ve never had a time where someone has not been willing to help,” Luiz said. “I’d say don’t be afraid to be a beginner. It’s kind of a beautiful thing to be a beginner.”
Bowen said she hopes the legacy of Aunt Skatie continues long after she graduates. To promote its longevity, she is working to establish an executive board that would alleviate the stress of running the organization alone. Bowen intends to create more opportunities for Aunt Skatie and the inclusive community they are trying to build. 
Additionally, Bowen is considering other ways Aunt Skatie can actively give back to the community, debating ways to become a more structured organization. 
“Ideally, I just want to have fun so we can run more events,” Bowen said. “I’m considering making it a LLC and then donating to charity if we ever make additional funds.”
Corwin commends Aunt Skatie for creating a welcoming and stress-free space for underrepresented gender and LGBTQIA skaters to improve their skills. 
“Groups like Aunt Skatie allow people space to improve their skills in a safe space so when they go to a place of more skilled skaters they have a little bit more experience under their belt,” Corwin said. “It’s hard to go cold into any space. And, so, if you know you’re going to go to a place where you’re going to be with people that are similarly minded and you’re meeting up at the same time, it’s fun.”
Aunt Skatie coordinates most of its meetups and events primarily through its Instagram account — @auntskatie. New members of any level, whether they attend USC or not, are always welcome to join.

The Trojans come off a 5-2 loss against Pepperdine in Malibu Saturday. Before the loss, USC was riding a four-match win streak where they allowed a total of 2 points and shut out both Arizona and Hawaii Pacific at home. 
The win streak comes after the Trojans ended February going 1-6. USC currently stands at 10-8, and the recent ITA team rankings released on Wednesday saw the Trojans jumped from No. 18 to No. 17. 
Sophomore Naomi Cheong, who scored one of USC’s two points in the loss to Pepperdine, has gone 2-0 in her last two singles appearances. She said it was important for the team to keep trusting the process while they went through the stretch of losses last month.
“It’s obviously starting to show because the last couple of weeks we’ve been doing better result-wise,” Cheong said. “It was definitely a learning curve for us.”
Two Trojans who have particularly performed well in singles this year are redshirt freshman Snow Han and junior Eryn Cayetano. Han holds a 26-8 record and recently rode a 13-match unbeaten streak until she lost to sophomore Janice Tjen in the match against Pepperdine. Meanwhile, Cayetano sits at 26-9 and currently ranks No. 6 overall in ITA’s singles rankings. 
During the win streak, the duo of Han and Cayetano went a combined 7-0 in singles. 
Cheong, Han’s doubles partner in the team’s last three matches, said Han and Cayetano anchor the team. 
“You know you can always count on them because they’re going to do their very best in each of their individual matches,” Cheong said. “That mindset definitely helps the team in general.”
The Trojans will look to establish rhythm in road fixtures. The team has gone 4-5 in road matches this year while 6-1 at home.
“When we go to other places, there’s other factors that we have to deal with that we don’t have to deal with at home,” Cheong said. “But, by all means, it can’t be an excuse.” 
The trip will start with a match at Stanford Friday. The Cardinal currently stand at 9-3 while undefeated in both Pac-12 play, and also came off a 7-0 victory over the Utes Sunday. 
Stanford freshmen Connie Ma and Alexandra Yepifanova have proven successful in singles. Both were highly ranked recruits who elevated the Cardinal to the No. 1 women’s tennis team last summer, according to Tennis Recruiting Network. The two hit the ground running and have not let Stanford down, as they both rank inside the top 20 in the nation for singles. Ma stands at a 19-4 record in singles while Yepifanova is 20-5. 
USC will then travel to Berkeley for a match against the Golden Bears, who are also undefeated against Pac-12 competition. Berkeley currently rides a three-match win streak, with back-to-back 7-0 victories against Utah and Colorado last weekend. 
Cheong said the team has talked about staying confident and blocking out external noise such as other team’s results.  
“We just want to focus on our job and what we want to do as a team,” Cheong said. “Coming into this weekend, we have a lot of hope and aspirations [for the team].”
USC is set to play against Stanford at 1:30 p.m. Friday and against Berkeley at 12 p.m. Saturday.
