The full responses to video of Prof. Sragow
I was surprised to see a Political Science professor making national headlines for ‘indoctrinating’ students in class by ‘bashing Republicans.’ The evidence played out in an edited 15-minute video taken by a camera hidden in student Tyler Talgo’s lapel. The original video was sent by this student to a notorious right-wing website that bracketed the video with an extremely partial commentary on what the video ‘showed’. I don’t know this professor. I have never met him, nor do I know his personal views, but there is something which seems to be getting missed in the usual ‘Marxist professor’ nonsense: it is really super creepy to secretly video anyone.

I’ve noticed students making audio recordings of professors without asking, which I also think it is at best impolite and at worst a violation of trust. Videoing an educator, and sending an edited video to a smear website is not the rational response of a student who is worried about an uncomfortable learning environment: going to the Head of Department or a Dean is. Indeed secretly taping professors and students is as much a violation of a comfortable learning environment where learning can be pursued without fear or favor as anything the professor did or did not do. In my life I have had right-wing and left-wing teachers. I’ve learned from all of them. USC has both left-wing and right-wing guest teachers (their bios rather give the game away to sensitive students). And our tenure-track faculty are non-political researchers and academics. My alma mater of Cambridge is currently dealing with a professor who expresses support for eugenics and expresses racial discrimination on his website. Students complained to the student union and the administration. That’s what you do when you’re genuinely offended. Don’t drag USC’s name through the mud to make cheap political points. Especially when that’s what you are accusing a professor of doing. And videoing people without their knowledge is super sketchy. That’s a point that is always true.

Dear Professor Sragow (and the Political Science department at USC)
I am writing to you today because I love my alma mater, am a proud member of the Trojan family, a veteran, a husband and father of four potential future USC students, I care about the reputation of my University, and I vote.
I just finished watching the video recordings of your lectures to students in your political science class that recently came out in the news. As a USC alumnus it is extremely disappointing to see a professor at my alma matter spewing such vile biased vitriol in the classroom, and calling it education.
You should be teaching students about our political system, how it is supposed to work, presenting facts, not opinions, and educating students in a neutral way.  Instead you have allowed your political leanings to cloud your ability to present material objectively and are abusing your position of authority granted you by the University and parents to forward an agenda in the classroom to indoctrinate students, our children mind you, to your political persuasion.  You get an failing grade as a professor for conducting yourself in this manner, and I find your remarks in the classroom highly disturbing.
Your conduct, and the unvarnished bias you exhibit to students is prohibitive in working towards creating a healthy educational environment. One could surmise that students taking your class, who may hold opposite political views and values, wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to explore or voice their beliefs in the learning environment you have created in your classroom without the fear being labeled by you in class with a slur or punished in how they are graded.
My hope is this is isolated, and you watch yourself from the students perspective, take stock in how you conduct yourself in the classroom, apologize to USC for the losing your way in the classroom, and to students and their parents who entrust you to educate their children, not indoctrinate them. Is that really how you see your role as a professor is in the lives of students? Adjust your rhetoric to enable students to get the education they are paying USC to get. There is no shame in admitting what you said was outside the scope of what you are there to do in the classroom, changing, and moving on.
Students shouldn’t be forced to sit in the classroom and have to listen to the angry rants of an ideologue (liberal or conservative) railing against a particular political position. Instead, they should be challenged to use their minds and critically think about how they will vote in elections, the importance of voting, the real impact political power has in our daily lives and how it shapes the society we live in without the vile rhetoric. To the point…they should leave the classroom having learned something and not knowing exactly what the professor’s personal or political views are.
There are forums on and off campus, like Tommy Trojan at lunch time, for all of us to voice our views in, where people can stop, tune in or tune out, and not feel intimidated that their grades or future is reliant on them agreeing with their professor’s bias or not.

Over the past 24 hours, I have watched with a mixture of horror and awe as my professor’s comments from my election law class last semester have been broadcast on The O’Reilly Factor and other conservative media outlets. My objection is not to the reaction to the comments my professor made. While I believe that Professor Sragow encouraged disagreement with his own views in class, I objected to many of the generalizations he used in the video clips. I believe that the Republican Party will not go extinct, but will instead play an important role in creating a better future for Americans of all racial makeups. My objection is to the serendipitous fashion in which his views were revealed. By using a camera to secretly videotape a professor, Tyler Talgo will deprive his fellow students of the real world political examples and academic security, which enhance the academic experience of Republican and Democratic students alike.
The University of Southern California has attracted a world-class political science faculty in large part by recruiting professors with considerable experience in the political world. These professors bring deeply routed knowledge in both campaign politics and government administrations to the classroom. They enrich their classrooms not by pontificating lofty statements on political theory, but by sharing their own, often partisan, experiences. In order to succeed as teachers, they need to be able to use examples and operate under the assumption that their comments will not be broadcast to potential enemies. At USC, stories from Republican and Democratic professors alike have taught me the value of understanding the rules of the game, hanging a lantern on your potential weaknesses, and finding a passion that resonates across party lines. I fear that in the future my professors will worry about sharing sensitive information, and I will be deprived of much of the richness of my academic experience thus far.
Perhaps even more importantly, my growth as a student depends on being able to take risks and push myself academically. Part of the beauty of learning is that sometimes it comes through failure. In this new technological age, the idea that all of my in class comments could be secretly recorded and broadcast to future employers through facebook or the blogosphere is offensive. USC has an obligation to protect their students. No student is going to feel comfortable arguing a new philosophical viewpoint, trying to say anything remotely intelligent about Ulysses, or discussing sensitive issues like race and gender if their views are not treated with discretion. Tyler Talgo’s actions are an affront to his classmates trust and the academic security, which ultimately facilitates the kind of bipartisan discussion he claims to seek.
If we truly hope to create an academic community where everyone feels comfortable expressing their views, we must fight to create trust and honest discussion. My hope is that the university will take steps to protect the integrity and security of their students and professors alike. American innovation and success is not built on a stifling big brother climate but instead on the free flow of discourse and ideas.

As a Conservative, USC alumna and former board member of the USC College Republicans, I was less than thrilled to see a video of my former professor Darry Sragow, in the same class that I took, bashing Republicans and making false and disparaging accusations about Republicans.
However, I’m also less than thrilled with the students in the class.
Conservatives know that many of our professors hold radically different views. We come into political science course expecting that the professors will go on liberal rants – that’s not unusual. It becomes a problem when our views are silenced or when it affects our grades, which can be dealt with after the course. Speaking from experience with Professor Sragow, this is not the case.
While I do not condone Mr. Sragow’s statements, and obviously his comments were over the top (and much more severe than when I was in his class), I think that Conservative students need to stand up and engage in debate when their beliefs are challenged. Secretly recording videos to expose a professor, even though his statements were inappropriate, is doing nothing to help the Conservative cause.
As Conservatives, we have an advantage in a college classroom because the bias we so often see is an opportunity to strengthen our arguments and learn how to communicate better. We don’t need to silence the opinions of Liberal professors, we need to debate and engage – Because at the end of the day, our ideas; ideas of limited government, personal responsibility, and individual liberty, are better. We can never communicate this if we refuse to speak up and let our classmates a different point of view. This is part of what we as College Republicans do.
While I think Professor Sragow might want to tone down his rhetoric, I think the responsibility lies with USC students to challenge Sragow’s accusations. When I was in his class, he made similar remarks and I regularly challenged him to the point where people laughed at me because they expected me to respond and argue.
Professor Sragow always welcomed debate and discussion and approached my comments with a dry sense of humor (that was indeed often partisan). Some students may not be comfortable in such a situation, but I think that students (especially conservative students) need to understand how important voicing their own views are in the classroom.
I don’t know what the university plans to do in response to this incident, but I will be very disappointed if Professor Sragow’s free speech is inhibited in any capacity, and I absolutely do not think he should be reprimanded for someone else’s decision to not speak up.
Conservatives, we are all about personal responsibility; it’s time for us to engage, not silence.

if that dude had substituted “women” or “black” for the word “white” in his bullshit he would be fired immediately and you know it.
Tyler is a coward, he couldn’t defend his worldview to the class or the professor.
As a grandchild and child of professors at four prestigious institutions, all of whom happen to be liberal, what Tyler did is rude at best and dishonest at worst. The video was edited so it isn’t fair to draw conclusions about the entire content of the course. But let’s actually examine the statements that are supposedly so offending. Which party obsessively blocks comprehensive immigration reform, constantly puts voter ID laws that would predominately affect non white people, and passes hateful amendments banning the loving union of gay men and women?
It should be clear to rational people that the republican party is a racist, homophobic organization. I have no problem with people being fiscally conservative though I think it is cruel and a terrible way to run a country, but socially conservative people are hateful and hypocritical.
So I don’t think the professor was wrong about anything. Tyler should grow a pair and stand up for his shitty ideology.
It was hatred and you know it!
Dear current students,
please remember, when the Affordable Care Act starts 2014, you, the current students of USC, will be paying for this professor’s chronic care bills and his social security forever….but, he can not teach you that or you would not vote for his ideas.
Your generation has been sold-out by the boomer generation who have not saved a dime nor taken care of their health.
And everyone is worried about videotaping? just wait for these bills to start rolling in, the country is broke!
I find it confusing that so many are opposed to videotaping lectures.  What do these professors have to hide?  If they would be ashamed or embarrassed if the content of their lectures were to be shared outside the classroom, I’d argue that they are not teaching, but most likely pontificating partisan sludge.
Aside from obvious practical reasons for recording lectures (re-listening later, while reading notes, can be a great way to internalize the material), it lends credibility to the institution and the program.  Many reputable institutions (i.e. Stanford) make many lecture videos available online, for free, to both students and the community.  That’s what an institution aimed at education should be doing.  I’m not sure where it comes from, but these comical claims about a “need for privacy” for these professors is completely ridiculous ous and borderline insane.
trojan student,
The issue is not “privacy”, but trust, respect for the professor an  the academic culture of USC and in this case with the obvious hidden, political agenda of the student. 
USC, like Stanford, offers degree programs online. My understanding is the USC student in question sent his surreptitious video to a highly partisan “faux news” stations likely with the intended highly inflammatory result.   
Inviting a Faux news level of discourse into the USC academic environment degrades intellectual inquiry as shown by many, though not all, comments in the original Daily Trojan article. Many claim “HATE” and malign Dr. Sragrow, but even when questioned providing no specific objectionable content.  
For instance, Ann Romney is claimed to “attacked”, though Dr. Sragow states she is probably a nice person, but one that most American’s cannot relate to as she looks like she belongs in a country club. This is a generous appraisal since many USC graduates in L.A. and other areas, along with Bain Capital executives, likely belong to country clubs, but how many have horses in the Olympics? How many Americans can afford a trip to the Olympics, an Olympian horse, or even a horse (much less a house)? An Olympian horse is not a WallMart of even Target item.
I encourage USC to take mesures to address the offending student’s behavior. Trust and respect for opinions that differ from your own, whether from a professor or fellow student, are essential in a classroom.  The intent of highly polarized news/”entertainment” venues are not educational. Perhaps the student might explain to the USC community what his intent in bringing the video to a biased “news” source was and why he did not talk to the professor in class or during office hours, his advisor, academic dean or other students. All have a right to know.
Clearly we have very different views over who is “wrong” here.
What prompted the student to react as he did?  Feelings of discomfort and frustration due to a lack of real “teaching” by this “professor.”
Don’t shoot the messenger.  This student exposed a real and significant problem with the way some of these classes are run, and I hope improvements can come of it.
I’m thankful to be in a major that focuses on transferring knowledge and furthering ability rather than subjecting students to biased rants.  Hopefully I don’t run into any of these nutjobs in my GE courses.
USC has shown a remarkable drive towards and has achieved academic excellence over the past decades. The academic profile of students (SAT’s, accomplishments) has risen markedly and the acceptance rate has dropped substantially. USC is no longer labeled the University of Spoiled Children–a moniker for a party school for the rich, white and privileged.
Many of the comments posted recently, to me, reflect the worst of the USC of the past. Comments reflecting the beliefs of those who seemingly expect to being able to bully and buy possessions, people and yes, elections, ranting and outraged because they no longer can. Ask Sheldon Adelson, casino owner, what his 60 million bought in the last election–not a presidency or one regional election. Not even Wayne LaPierre and the NRA leadership, the epitome of very angry, old white guys are doing so well buying and bullying elected officials and the American public.
To those behaving like the school yard bully who has just been whooped, stop trying to kill the messenger. Sragow’s message is neither original nor new. Surely you have read or heard it before directly from esteemed leaders of the Republican Party after the last elections. I applaud the centrist leadership of the Republican Party taking a careful self-examination and acknowledging America has changed and they have not. Perhaps more rank and file Republicans need to do the same as well.
Yes, USC has grown and changed as it continues its march toward greatness, along the way attracting many of the best and brightest students and faculty. I congratulate USC and applaud the change, though recognize it is difficult for some.
Oh please, shame on you. Stop trying to move the debate. Very old technique.
This is TOTAL HATE. Shame on you trying to blame the student.
No critical thinking, nothing but hate.
Shame!
USC parent,
University’s are designed to educate – that means fostering an atmosphere where critical thinking can be cultivated. Nothing the professor ranted about provided any level of education, and those that did attempt to debate him, received snide responses in return. If the professor wants an atmosphere of debate, he should perhaps work on developing the ability to appear neutral (or play devils advocate for either side), while encouraging students to explore their thoughts. What this pitiful excuse for a professor has focused on is indoctrinating his class with his left-ist, emotion-filled demagoguery. Those who lack the ability to debate, turn to personal attacks. 
If USC has grown and changed “in it’s march toward greatness”, as you say, then what is your definition of greatness? Telling students what to think rather than helping them develop critical thinking skills is hardly a characteristic of greatness. I applaud this student for taping this vile example of “Higher Education.”

The Gould School of Law is now home to the Music Copyright Infringement Resource, an online case archive consisting of hundreds of music infringement cases.
Old tunes · An archive of music infringement cases, which dates back to 1845, is now housed at the university in the Gould School of Law. – Alexander Horsono | Daily Trojan
The digital archive, which contains material dating back to 1845, provides complete summaries of every U.S. music copyright decision, including those involving Michael Jackson, George Harrison and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Jonathan Barnett, a professor of law and the academic director of the Entertainment and Media Law Program at the Gould School of Law, said the opportunity to sponsor a project of this magnitude was an honor.
“We were approached with the opportunity to host it, and we feel it’s a great complement to our knowledge and resource of the [Entertainment and Media Law Program],” Barnett said. “We are very happy to have this opportunity.”
Barnett said Music Copyright Infringement Resource is a convenient tool for the university’s law students.
“It’s useful for our students because it covers a lot of leading cases historically in music copyright,” Barnett said. “If a student is taking a class in copyright and wants to learn more about a case, or if students want to do a research project on a particular case, the [Music Copyright Infringement Resource] gives them that opportunity.”
Founded in 1997 by Charles Cronin, a professor at the Gould School of Law, this project was established after the 1984 copyright case Selle v. Gibb. In Selle, a garage band musician claimed that the Bee Gees song “How Deep Is Your Love” was strikingly similar to his song called “Let It End.”  The final ruling concluded an appellant needed concrete evidence to win a case.
Cronin said that it is necessary to have a resource like the Music Copyright Infringement Resource in order to be able to access, analyze and compare and contrast cases with one another.
“A lot of digital information projects are shedding light on an area of law that is otherwise not accessible,” Cronin said. “By having access to this project, one can look critically at jury decisions and courts’ decisions, and evaluate them with far more information than otherwise known.”
Barnett said the Music Copyright Infringement Resource is free to the public and can be accessed for one’s own interests and benefits.
“It uses a certain index, a chronological index, to organize the cases. Historical material and commentary are available with every decision,” Barnett said.
Law students, music students, librarians and information technology staff members at USC, UCLA and Columbia University have further developed Cronin’s idea. As Cronin enhances this project, he seeks to develop a more global and universal resource.
“I hope in the future it will expand to make more and more of this information universally available so that students, journalists, lawyers and professors everywhere will have access to it,” Cronin said.
Both Cronin and Barnett hope the university community, particularly its music, business and cinema schools and their libraries, will use and benefit from the project.
“This project is very much associated with the film and recording industry, and USC seems perfect as it has a strong entertainment law program as well as a very well-known cinema school,” Cronin said. “Seemed like an appropriate home for it.”

El Centro Ambassadors, a coalition of students, alumni, parents, community members and organizations, is petitioning university officials to stop the slated June 1 relocation of El Centro Chicano, an organization that provides support and services to USC’s Latino students.
Movement · The petition, which protests El Centro Chicano’s relocation from the United University Church, has received 519 signatures. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The petition, which was released April 3, is addressed to President C. L. Max Nikias, Provost Elizabeth Garrett and Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Denzil Suite, and argues against moving El Centro from the United University Church on 34th Street, its home of 33 years, to a space within the Student Union or Ronald Tutor Campus Center. The petition argues that the move will cause space limitations that will inhibit the center’s functioning capacities.
As of Sunday, the petition had 519 supporters. The El Centro Ambassadors said the goal is 800 signatures.
Though an exact place for the relocation has not been announced, the organization will be relocated to either the Student Union or the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, said El Centro Chicano Director William N. Vela in a statement.
Vela said the university administration believes the move will better foster the interactions between campus organizations.
Suite said plans for relocation were made because the university wants to bring El Centro Chicano physically closer to other student organizations in student affairs.
“El Centro is the only programmatic office in the Division of Student Affairs that is not currently in the Campus Center or the Student Union,” Suite said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “This move will bring them together with other areas, which offer educational, cultural and support services to students.”
Other university cultural organizations, including Asian Pacific American Student Services, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the LGBT Resource Center, are currently housed within the Student Union.
The El Centro Ambassadors, who “advocate for equal consideration of the student voice,”have started a petition in hopes of preventing the relocation. El Centro has called the United University Church home for 33 years.
“We are asking for a meeting with Garrett, Nikias and Denzil to talk about the decision that has been made without those being directly affected by it the most,” the Ambassadors said in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
The Ambassadors argue that the center’s move will force El Centro into a space that is one-fourth the size of its current location.
“It is highly unlikely that the Student Union will allow for the quantity and quality of programming,” the petition states. “For instance, the Student Union closes at 5 p.m. Student organizations that host meetings and events at El Centro, and a handful of students who use the space to study after 5 p.m., will have to find other locations, which are few.”
Suite said the petition reinforces the positive work of El Centro, which he hopes the relocation will continue to foster.
“The petition serves as a helpful reminder to us that the work of El Centro is very important and has positively touched many lives at the university,” Suite said. “We are committed to ensuring that their great work continues for years to come.”
Those who are petitioning, however, said relocation is not the only process to better the communication between campus organizations.
“A change in space does not mean that there will be an increase in the interaction and communication between the different groups,” the petition reads. “This is an internal problem that USC has failed to address.”
Rosalind Conerly, the assistant director of the Center of Black Cultural and Student Affairs, said the CBCSA and El Centro already play integral roles in working with one another without being housed in the same building.
“We go through similar issues, so we do a lot of programming together,” Conerly said. “We often talk with one another about how to grow together and offer the best services to our students.”
Though plans for El Centro’s relocation are not concrete, the CBCSA will continue to serve a supportive role, Conerly said. She said she sees the benefits in relocation, but also said El Centro’s current location is valuable for multiple student groups’ programming.
“It will be nice that we are closer because we do work collaboratively,” Conerly said. “But we all utilize their sanctuary. They have that wonderful lecture space, so we do use it for programming and for outreach. When new students come, it’s a great way to introduce them to USC and the cultural centers.”
Some students affiliated with El Centro Chicano said the move will not only result in the loss of the building, but a loss in a sense of community. Susana Pineda, a junior majoring in psychology, said the move will be a loss to many Latino students who have spent time at El Centro and built emotional connections to it.
“Moving El Centro is like moving homes for so many students,” Pineda said. “Although just a location, it’s absurd to say that this place has not grown on so many students, who spend long hours studying, working or just enjoying each other’s company in the homely and resourceful environment that El Centro provides. It will be a hard adjustment to those students who have a history at the University Church.”
The Ambassadors did not specify an end date for the petition.

Lee Epstein, the provost professor of law and political science at the Gould School of Law and at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, was awarded the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship Thursday based on her scholarship on diversity among federal judges.
Each year, the fellows are appointed based on distinguished achievement and potential for future accomplishment. Fellowships typically support a scholar’s work for a 6-12 month period of time. Epstein is one of 175 recipients of this year’s fellowship.
“I’m honored to serve as a Guggenheim fellow and look forward to continuing my work on the role of diversity in the federal courts,” Epstein said in a statement.
Epstein, who will continue to teach at USC, currently holds the Rader Family Trustee Chair in Law. She specializes in the study of judicial decision-making, judicial appointments and legal research.
“I have long been an admirer of Professor Epstein’s outstanding scholarship in the areas of constitutional law, judicial behavior and the empirical analysis of legal institutions; she is the prototypical provost professor who combines insights from several disciplines to produce research of consequence,” said Elizabeth Garrett, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at USC, in a statement.
USC Gould Dean Robert K. Rasmussen said Epstein’s ability to educate is equally as strong as her scholastic pursuits.
“She is not only a brilliant scholar, she is an exceptional teacher who truly cares about her students and colleagues,” Rasmussen said.
Epstein was also the recipient of the Law and Courts Service Award from the American Political Science Association section and was selected as the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for the 2013-14 academic year.

As the old saying goes, time flies when you’re having fun. And if USC’s No. 4 men’s tennis team equates success with fun, it might not be surprising that they just hosted their last two regular season matches, dispatching the No. 43 Oregon Ducks 7-0 on Friday and the No. 31 Washington Huskies 6-1 on Saturday.
The Trojan lineup, which has been subject to much change recently, was nearly back to full force this weekend, as the team saw the return of sophomore Roberto Quiroz and his cousin, junior co-captain Emilio Gomez. Both missed last weekend’s matches to help guide their home country of Ecuador to a win over Chile in the Davis Cup. The cousins arrived back at USC on Tuesday and were forced to get right back into the swing of things in order to take on two more Pac-12 opponents at Marks Stadium.
“We’re pretty tired,” Quiroz said. “But I think overall it was a really great experience that we can take advantage of … because we gained more experience.”
Against Oregon, Gomez and Quiroz’s doubles match was suspended at 7-4, as their teammates on courts one and three clinched the doubles point for the Trojans with identical scores of 8-3 each before the Ecuadorians could finish.
In singles, the Trojans put on a clinic to capture a 7-0 win over the Ducks. USC head coach Peter Smith sat freshman Max de Vroome, who is still recovering from a wrist injury, opting to start sophomore Jonny Wang at the No. 6 spot instead. Wang demonstrated his capabilities by only dropping one game en route to a decisive 6-0, 6-1 victory that would set the tone for the rest of his teammates.
Sophomore Eric Johnson followed suit by putting up an impressive 6-2, 6-1 win, allowing junior co-captain Ray Sarmiento to clinch the match for the Trojans in a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Oregon’s 6-foot-8 slugger Jeff Mullen. Though he stands at only 5-foot-10, Sarmiento wasn’t intimidated by his opponent’s size and employed an array of drop shots and sharply angled forehands to take him down.
“I just returned his serve and got him moving from the start and I was in good shape,” Sarmiento said.
Sarmiento and his teammates carried their success into Saturday’s battle against No. 31 Washington, taking down the Huskies 6-1 to improve to 22-2 overall and a perfect 5-0 in Pac-12 play.
Because it was the last regular-season home match, the Trojans honored their lone senior, Michael Tang. The positive energy that resulted from the senior’s send-off seemed to show in doubles play, as USC came bursting out of the gates.
Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann led the way, dominating the top Husky team 8-2. Next, Johnson and de Vroome swiftly served their way to an 8-4 comeback victory after falling behind 3-1. Just seconds later, Quiroz and Gomez wrapped up their match 8-6 to put the Trojans up 1-0 heading into singles play.
Once again, USC flexed its muscle in singles play. Johnson wrapped up a successful weekend by being the first to finish, taking down his opponent 6-2, 6-2 on court five. Hanfmann defeated his opponent 6-3, 6-1, extending his incredible undefeated streak in singles to 17 matches, leaving Wang to clinch the match for the Trojans with a 6-3, 6-2 win over his opponent before Sarmiento and Quiroz took down their opponents 6-1, 6-2 and 6-4, 6-2, respectively.
“When you can watch guys play like that you’ve got to at some point just sit back and relax,” Smith said. “It’s really enjoyable to watch.”
Washington’s only point came off an upset of USC’s Gomez, who is ranked No. 5 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association, by Washington’s No. 17 Kyle McMorrow. Intense Davis Cup play and jetlag appeared to finally catch up with Gomez, as he struggled to make a first serve in the last half of his 7-6 (4), 5-7, 1-0 (10-7) loss to the Huskies’ only ranked player.
Though disappointed with Gomez’s play, Smith was happy about the weekend overall, particularly with the team’s performance in doubles.
“It’s all about chemistry and communication,” Smith said. “It’s hard to say you’re going to win an eight-game pro-set every time, but we’re putting our best foot forward.”
Good wins for men tennis which means absolutely little vs. these teams. It is all about beating ucla this week
at their home court. Actually all comes down to the sweet sixteen play to determine the national title that anyone
remembers year to year.
Noticed no mention of the baseball results for the weekend or terrible finish by the men volleyball team in the
sport’s section today. Two more head / interim coaches that must be replaced for next season.

When handicapping Arizona State’s three-way quarterback competition last fall, most onlookers narrowed their gaze to strong-armed sophomore Mike Bercovici and fleet-footed freshman Michael Eubank. Redshirt junior Taylor Kelly only entered the discussion as the safe, yet altogether vanilla, fallback — a game manager who could split the difference between the other two quarterbacks’ strengths.
Coming off of an epic late-season collapse in which they lost their final five games of 2011 after beginning 6-2, the Sun Devils might have opted to make a splash by starting the “toolsiest” specimen at quarterback, and few would have blamed them. But new head coach Todd Graham recognized that swift cone-drill times and countless 225-pound bench press repetitions don’t necessarily translate into regular season victories.
Throughout 2012 fall camp, Kelly proved to be a study in passer efficiency, giving Graham no other choice but to give him the starting nod, much to the dismay of the underwhelmed Arizona State fan base.
Twenty-nine touchdowns and a 67.1 completion percentage later, Kelly now rightly belongs in the thick of the discussion about the No. 2 quarterback in the Pac-12 behind University of Oregon sensation Marcus Mariota.
In a weird way, this Arizona State retrospective draws a striking parallel to USC’s current three-way quarterback competition, in which the best option — sophomore Cody Kessler — is also, frankly, the least sexy.
It’s unusual that a player can complete 15 of 22 passes for 242 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions while not wowing you with any particular sequence. But that’s exactly what Kessler did in Saturday’s spring game, even despite his 70-yard touchdown strike to junior wide receiver Marqise Lee on his very first throw, which hit the reigning Biletnikoff winner perfectly in stride 40 yards downfield.
For some unexplainable reason, until looking at Kessler’s statistics after the scrimmage, his performance still seemed almost humdrum.
It doesn’t require a wealth of scouting experience to discern Kessler’s physical limitations. At 6-foot-1, his height is below average for the position. He’s mobile, but by no means a dual threat. His release is a touch long and jerky. And his arm strength pales in comparison to his two competitors, fellow sophomore Max Wittek and freshman Max Browne.
Though Wittek’s star lost some luster after his putrid performance in the Sun Bowl, his deep-ball prowess conjures up dreams of Lee and sophomore wide receiver Nelson Agholor racing down sidelines several times per game for long gains. Wittek also owns a better pedigree than his fellow 2011 class signee, as he succeeded Matt Barkley at Mater Dei and was ranked as the No. 3 quarterback recruit in the nation according to ESPN, whereas Kessler was rated, by spoiled USC standards, a pedestrian 29th.
And according to most scouting services, Browne entered USC as the No. 1 quarterback in the class of 2013. To accompany his picture-perfect delivery, his arm strength compares favorably with Wittek’s. If any one of these players projects as a future mainstay in the NFL, it’s this precocious talent from Sammamish, Wash.
But Saturday’s spring game also magnified both quarterbacks’ unmistakable — and unacceptable — warts. Wittek still struggles with his decision-making and accuracy, as he was intercepted twice by senior safety Demetrius Wright. The first interception came on an underthrown heave into double coverage that was intended for Agholor, and the second occurred after he threw another pass into tight coverage that deflected off of Lee’s shoulder pad. Neither throw should have been made in the first place.
Browne’s shortcomings mostly stem from inexperience. Understandably lacking complete fluency in the playbook at this point, he stares down receivers all too often and struggles to create space for himself in the pocket when his initial foothold breaks down; this caused him to suffer several sacks on the day.
For what it’s worth, however, he appears light-years ahead of where Wittek and Kessler were in their first spring practices.
In many ways, Kessler is USC’s Taylor Kelly. The Bakersfield native features pinpoint accuracy, savvy escapability in the pocket and old-fashioned moxie. Unfazed by the free-roaming, predatory senior defensive end Morgan Breslin constantly bearing down on him, two dropped passes by receivers and unfavorable passing downs after failed runs, Kessler simply made every necessary play. Named the offense’s team captain before the game, Kessler conducted himself as the man in charge even though he began the first series of the scrimmage on the bench.
We can’t forget that quarterbacks, in particular, often either surpass or fall short of the sum of their parts — not everything can be neatly measured with a stopwatch or yardstick. Naming Kessler as the starting quarterback might ultimately come as a letdown for a disgruntled USC fan base that wants thrilling, high-octane entertainment (see: Andy Enfield’s Dunk City).
But take it from a one-time Kessler skeptic: He can lead a Trojan turnaround. He proved it at the Coliseum this weekend, and he’ll do it again come fall.

Kessler should absolutely be the starter.  All the arm strength in the world won’t help if you are making poor decisions.  Wittek (like Barkley) was an INT machine at MD and still shows that tendency.  I hope we give Kessler the shot he deserves.

There was no doubt that Saturday’s game against No. 2 Stanford would be the toughest test of the season for the top-ranked, undefeated USC women’s water polo team. And after four quarters of gritty play, the Cardinal (24-1) pulled off the 6-4 upset, handing the Women of Troy (20-1) their first loss of 2013.
Tripped up · Junior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell scored USC’s first goal of its 6-4 loss to No. 2 Stanford on Saturday at Uygtengsu Acquatics Center. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The story of the day was defense, as each team scored well below their usual tallies. Both defenses were able to disrupt the usual offensive flow for the opposing squad, but the Stanford defensive scheme proved to be just enough to give them the edge: The four-goal total for USC was its lowest scoring output on the season.
Stanford was held down for the most part by the USC defense, but capitalized on the few opportunities they received. Senior two-meter Melissa Seidemann led the charge for the Cardinal offensive attack, bursting out of the gate with the first two goals of the game to put Stanford up 2-0.
After two consecutive missed shots by USC junior two-meter Hannah Buckling and another missed opportunity by freshman driver Anni Espar, Stanford freshman driver Maggie Steffens found the back of the net to give the Cardinal some extra padding to the lead.
USC junior two-meter Colleen O’Donnell scored before the end of the quarter to cut the deficit to 3-1, but an errant pass on the next possession would ensure that they would not score again in the quarter.
The Women of Troy had their first two shot opportunities blocked in the early part of the second quarter, and Stanford capitalized on the momentum to score the quarter’s only goal. The Cardinal were able to make a big defensive stop near their cage and take the ball back the length of the pool, where a guarded Steffens found Stanford junior driver Kaitlyn Lo to increase the lead to 4-1.
Both offenses would continue to sputter after the half, as each team would only score one goal in the third frame. Stanford’s came first, as sophomore two-meter Ashley Grossman put her name on the scorecard to bolster the Cardinal lead, 5-1. After a USC timeout, Espar shot a laser past Stanford senior goalie Kate Baldoni from top shelf to make it a 5-2 game.
Espar would find herself in the spotlight again early in the fourth quarter, as her converted five-meter penalty shot gave the Women of Troy life as the Cardinal lead was cut to just two goals. The USC offense, however, would not be able to make good on its next few shot attempts, and Stanford junior driver Kaley Dodson finally put the nail in the coffin with her goal from the perimeter, putting the Cardinal up 6-3.
USC junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist had two more looks at the net but missed high on both. And though sophomore driver Monica Vavic was able to cut the Stanford lead to 6-4 with just over 30 seconds remaining in the game, the Cardinal held onto the ball for the final seconds to seal the upset victory.
A major reason why the USC offensive attack came up short was its inability to score on six-on-five chances. The Women of Troy were ejected fewer times than the Cardinal players were, but also converted fewer chances.
“Our six-on-five offense was just not very good today,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “We rushed it. We tried what we did in the last game, but Stanford is a smart team, and they covered it.”
USC junior goalie Flora Bolonyai was a star in her own right during the game, coming up with five big blocks. Though the loss stung, she knows it is not the end of the road for this squad.
“If it was a slap in our face, it came at the right time,” Bolonyai said. “We still have four more weeks until the NCAA [championships], and that’s the goal. We are just going to have to work extra hard from now on.”
The Women of Troy honored their five graduating seniors before the game, as Constance Hiller, Nicolina McCall, Blair Moody, Dominique Sardo, Georgette Hernandez and Chelsea Silvers all suited up for the final home game of their careers. For Sardo, who was a part of the USC squad that took home the 2010 NCAA championship, the day was bittersweet.
“It was really special,” Sardo said. “We’ve been together for the past four years, and we won a national championship together freshman year, and we really want to go back and do it again this year.”
Though the USC loss evens the playing field in the overall standings, the Cardinal — which is expected to regain the top spot in the national polls — clinched themselves the No. 1 seed in the upcoming Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament. The Women of Troy will take on No. 3 UCLA this Friday in Westwood for the right to the    No. 2 seed in the tournament.

Saturday marked the return of some familiar sights, sounds and the unmistakable scent of bacon-wrapped hot dogs to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the USC football team took the field for its spring exhibition game.
In command · Redshirt sophomore quarter back Cody Kessler (6) had the best day of USC’s three quarterbacks in Saturday’s spring game, completing 15 of 22 passes for 242 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The game was played between the offense and defense, with traditional scoring for the cardinal-clad offensive team and special scoring in place for the white-wearing defense, in which the defense tallied three points for stops, five points for turnovers and seven points for defensive touchdowns. Despite getting dominated at the line of scrimmage and recording a dismal -36 rushing yards, the offense pulled out the victory, 42-36, thanks to a lethal aerial attack.
In addition to changes in scoring, another change in the game came from the virtual absence of tackling — a precautionary measure for a team that has lost 20 players, 16 of whom are on scholarship, to injuries this spring. Despite the alarming number of absences, USC head coach Lane Kiffin was confident about his team’s near-full recovery come fall.
“Even though there’s 20 injuries, there’s really only one, hopefully, that will affect next fall … which is [junior wide receiver] George [Farmer], so all these guys should be back,” Kiffin said.
With Farmer out for the entire 2013-14 season with a torn ACL and MCL, there were questions surrounding the No. 3 wide receiver spot — a question which was soundly answered on the field Saturday by sophomore wideout Victor Blackwell, whose athleticism and reliable hands netted him 155 yards on seven receptions and one touchdown.
Blackwell’s fellow wide receivers junior Marqise Lee and sophomore Nelson Agholor, the presumptive No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, got off to a hot start early, slicing the depleted defensive back corps to ribbons and getting open at various spots on the field at will throughout the first quarter. Lee showed no signs of rust coming off his Biletnikoff Award-winning 2012 campaign, netting 148 yards on eight receptions and three touchdowns.
When asked about his goals for this coming season, Lee said he wanted to go the whole year without dropping a ball.
“For me, it’s possible. That is one of my goals,” Lee said.
Lee demonstrated exactly how he would go about accomplishing that goal on a connection with sophomore quarterback Max Wittek. Running a streak up the right sideline, Lee was blanketed by two defensive backs while being ushered out of bounds as he approached the endzone. Wittek slightly overthrew Lee and the spiraling ball started to err outside the sideline when Lee leapt, contorted his body into position and snatched it from dropping out of bounds before landing with both feet in the endzone for a 30-yard touchdown. Lee’s breathtaking display of athleticism drew audible gasps from the crowd of more than 15,000.
Though Lee’s abilities were never called into question Saturday, the starting quarterback question became only murkier with the exemplary performance of sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler. Kessler started strong, with his first throw of 2013 landing in the hands of a wide-open Lee over the middle for a 70-yard touchdown. Kessler finished 15 for 22 for 242 yards and three touchdowns, but not without his share of miscues, including being sacked four times and telegraphing his throws for batted balls on a couple occasions.
Incumbent starter Wittek threw for 145 yards on 12 for 17 passing for two touchdowns and two interceptions. Despite the interceptions (one of which came on a tipped ball), Wittek looked nimble and polished, exercising great awareness while deftly evading defenders by stepping up into the pocket to buy extra time.
Wittek further impressed in situational play by spearheading a drive to end the first half in a modified two-minute drill. Wittek looked to his flats for short completions and managed the game clock like a veteran, punctuating the 51-yard drive with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Blackwell with 18 seconds left in the half. The statistics didn’t deter Wittek’s self-evaluation. When asked if he felt if he had done enough to be named the starter, Wittek answered confidently.
“Yeah, I think I played well, I think I put a good resume on film,” Wittek said. “I look forward to seeing what happens.”
Like his peers, freshman quarterback Max Browne found his rhythm early, connecting with Agholor for a 44-yard touchdown on a play-action post. Later in the game, however, Browne fell victim to five sacks and an interception.
“Towards the end [I] probably took too many sacks; that’ll come with time as I get used to protections and the check downs, but I felt like it was a solid job,” Browne said.
Of the three quarterbacks, Browne has made the most progress. The freshman started spring practice by skipping through progressions and looking overwhelmed by the speed of the game and ended spring Saturday looking to make plays.
“[I’m] definitely glad I got these extra 15 practices in,” Browne said. “From day one to day fifteen, I’ve learned a lot. I’m a lot more comfortable both in the huddle with the offense, with the guys. It’s been a big improvement for me.”
Regardless of how the quarterback battle pans out, this spring has been one of great progress for all three Trojan signal callers. Perhaps Kiffin summarized his quarterback quandary best.
“There’s a lot of people around the country [who] are trying to find one really good quarterback,” Kiffin said. “I think we have three.”

There are dramatically fewer female writers than male writers working in the television industry, according to a new study released by the Writers Guild of America, West, which examined employment patterns for writers from the 2011-12 television season.
In a world that seems to have progressed in the matter of gender equality, not only is this data surprising, but it begs the question: Is it possible that the entertainment industry is trailing behind the rest of America in gender inequality?
According to the study, only an estimated 30.5 percent of writers were women in the last TV season. Even more shockingly, that number has only increased 5.5 percent since 1999.
If we are to follow the survey’s predictions, it will be another 42 years before women — roughly half of the population — reach proportionate representation in television writing employment.
Forty-two years. That’s a long time. Teleportation could occur sooner.
Looking at the data, it is easy to summarize that because there is a lack of women writers, fewer women voices are being projected through television, which would suggest why there are fewer women overall on screen.
USC Annenberg Professor Stacy Smith found data that confirmed that theory when she looked at roles and occupations in media. Smith found that in children’s shows, females represent only 30.8 percent of the characters.
When it comes to speaking roles, only about 44 percent of females are employed  in comparison to the 55 percent of males who are employed.
Perhaps more alarming, Smith’s 2012 research pointed out that more often than not, women are portrayed in a stereotypical manner.
This means that not only are females underrepresented, but they are also more prone to being depicted in harmful, stereotypical fashions.
Young females need more aspirational role models in greater leadership positions in various fields and occupational sectors. How can that change if the writers are mostly male? After all, it is not a large leap to assume that male writers will more often than not write more convincingly about men because that is what they know.
One only needs to look as far as the hit show Big Bang Theory, whose head writers are three males — Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady and Steven Molaro — to see the problem. In a recent episode, Leonard, Sheldon and Howard give an unsuccessful presentation to young girls about pursuing careers in science. Though one could say that the point of the episode was to show the need for more females in scientific fields, the message was jumbled. For the audience watching, the men in the show wear suits and speak academically, while the ladies head to Disneyland and get made into pretty princesses. There’s something about that, which feels very contradictory.
Some might argue that there is plenty of strong female writing on television now. The Mindy Project is just one current TV example centered on not just a woman, but also a successful woman. Mindy is a successful doctor, one that addresses problems head-on and does not fall into the damsel-in-distress female character persona. Moreover, Melissa & Joey, which returns to air May 29, focuses on Mel, a successful female politician and Juey, her male nanny. Talk about getting away from stereotypes.
Still, we should not let a few good examples, such as The Mindy Project and Melissa & Joey, detract from the fact that there is still a problem.
As Huffington Post writer Nina Bahadur said, “For every Carrie Mathison, the brilliant, complicated spy Claire Danes plays on Homeland, there are six Real Housewives.”
At the end of the day, Mindy and Mel unfortunately represent just a small wave on TV. There are countless examples to serve as their foils: Elena Gilbert in The Vampire Diaries, for example, spends a majority of her time thinking about which boy she likes more. Her focus seems primarily on the boys in her life. And Elena is not alone.
This is even more apparent in reality television shows, such as Toddlers & Tiaras, where it seems a female’s importance lies solely on how she appears and how society perceives her. Shows similar to that just push back progress in gender equality.
And even when there are shows intended to showcase successful women, there is still something stereotypical about they way they are portrayed. For example, Zoe Hart in Hart of Dixie is a successful and powerful doctor. However, she is always depicted as perfect, which is unrealistic for anyone, male or female. All characters have faults — that’s what makes them compelling and to be considered successful. Women should not be held to a different standard.
Still, progress is continuing. Despite problems with her character, Zoe is a doctor and Mel and Mindy are not ideal stay-at-home moms who care for their partners’ every needs. This shows that progress is happening in the industry, albeit at a slower rate than one might hope.
The glass ceiling has been splintered. Let us hope that it doesn’t take 42 years until the sky shines all the way through the television screen, though.

Making a great movie about a great man is difficult. 42, Brian Helgeland’s biopic of baseball legend Jackie Robinson, is Exhibit A.

Rationally, Robinson’s story demands proud display. Here is a good man, talented and humble, who is put under unbelievable pressure and unjust adversity. The man faces them with uncommon courage and not only overcomes them, but also does so in an exceptional way. Robinson’s accomplishments transcended sports, and his courage partly inspired the civil rights movement that came about eight years later.
A movie about his struggle almost had to be made, and in theory, the movie is (forgive the word choice) a home run. But in practice, it is not nearly as impressive, bending under the weight of its own message.
The movie centers on the events during the summers of 1946 and 1947. Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, played extremely well by Harrison Ford, decides he wants to hire a black player. He realizes that both the player and the team will face an intense amount of resistance: Black players were allowed to play in the minor leagues through the 1880s, but when the major league was created, black people were prevented from joining.
Rickey knows this, and he knows what it would mean for the player. During the search at the beginning of the movie, he not only looks for a great baseball player, but someone who is strong enough to take the abuse he knows is coming and turn the other cheek instead of fighting back, which could be been turned around by racists as simply an indictment of black aggressiveness.
He finds his man in Robinson, a multisport athlete at UCLA and ex-Army officer. Played by relative unknown Chadwick Boseman, Robinson signs a contract, and his fight begins. For the rest of the film, he has to deal with vitriol from fans, opposing players, umpires and even teammates.
Racism comes at Robinson nonstop; the movie pulls few punches in showing just how constant it was. A group of teammates petition to get him off the team, a sheriff threatens to shut down a game if he continues playing and threat letters continue to be directed at him.
Robinson had to walk through fire to integrate baseball, and 42 makes sure you don’t miss the heat. There is a scene where an opposing manager yells abuse at Robinson for what seems like half an hour, and the scene keeps on and on, making you watch helplessly. It is disquieting, to say the least.
The movie rightly focuses on this struggle against racism and the toll it takes on Robinson, who is constantly on edge, wondering from where the next attack will come. You are shown just how difficult it was, and through impassioned speeches by Rickey and a handful of other supporters, you are reminded just what a huge significance this all has. It is impossible to watch the movie and not see the fight this man had to endure — all the things thrown at him and what it ultimately meant to so many people.
Unfortunately, it is possible to achieve all this and still come out objectively flat as a movie.
You are shown and told everything you need to hear. Perhaps the problem is that despite everything you are shown, the movie fails to make you feel much of anything. The message is powerful, but the movie unfortunately is not.
You are spoon-fed the message because Helgeland clearly and rightfully did not want you to miss it. It is an important message, but a director sometimes must trust his audience and his own directorial powers. In an effort to make sure you see the symbolism of Robinson, the movie sacrifices its cinematic quality.
In a way, Biopics about people with troubled lives are much easier to write than those which focus on role models. It’s definitely possible, as Lincoln showed us just a few months ago, but is very difficult. A powerhouse performance from Daniel Day-Lewis’ definitely helped in that case, but Boseman and Ford are definitely not at fault for 42’s failings. Lincoln is a superior movie because it did not simplify its message to the lowest common denominator and hit you over the head with it. It showed you the drama and, save for a corny scene to open the movie, let it speak for itself.
The Jackie Robinson story is one worth knowing, and it is difficult to find a better medium to make an impact than the big screen. The movie should be seen and the message should be taken in because what Robinson did deserves recognition and understanding.
However, if the director had trusted his audience a little more, the movie would not have to survive on message alone.

Disconnect is a movie that takes on the ambitious goal of capturing the impact of all of digital communication’s worst side effects in one whirlwind of a film. Though cyberbullying, online child pornography and identity theft would be topics enough for separate feature films, Disconnect, directed by Henry-Alex Rubin, unabashedly stuffs them together into compartmentalized subplots that hurriedly rush toward a conclusion.

Unfortunately, the sprinter runs out of breath, as each subplot comes to a dramatic yet unfulfilling conclusion in a fashion that is somewhat cliche. Nevertheless, Disconnect is ultimately successful in its presentation of the perils that digital communication technology brings to society.
Disconnect presents its weighty themes in a distinctly cavalier manner. Kyle (Max Thieriot) is a teenage pornstar who makes money with a group of teenagers by contacting clients over the Internet and soliciting private video conferences.
In an early scene, a travelling hand-held camera shot follows Kyle walking through a residence. Despite how it sounds, the scene is anything but casual. If one looks in the periphery of the shots, one glimpses inside different rooms where webcam sex shows are going on.
The scene manages not to thrust the adult issues out in public, but rather to show how these can happen on the periphery, where one might not look.
Thieriot’s convincing performance also serves to further shine a light on how the advent of technology has intergrated these troublesome issues into society.
Meanwhile, as Kyle’s story plays out, a husband and wife (Alexander Skarsgård and Paula Patton), who are struggling with the death of their first child, have their identities stolen. They hire a private investigator, Mike Dixon (Frank Grillo), to comb their hard drives for clues to the attackers’ identities, which reveals information more harmful than helpful to their marriage. As they deal with tension, the financial ruin befalling them due to the identity theft, and the residual grief from the loss of their first child, the middle school son of the detective (Colin Ford) and a friend cyber bully a fellow student (Jonah Bobo), whose dysfunctional family is caught up in their working lives and the technology that defines them.
Dixon’s middle school son (Colin Ford) is a cyberbully who torments a fellow student Ben Boyd (Jonah Bobo), whose dysfunctional family is caught up in their working lives and the technology that defines them. Boyd’s parents (Jason Bateman and Hope Davis) have never understood their son, whose passion for music, gothic fashion and long hair runs against societal norms.
As is the case with movies that develop multiple plots, the casual observer expects a conclusion in the style of Pulp Fiction, where stories collide in a flash of drama and revelation. True to form, said scene duly arrives, sans the epic clash. Though some stories intersect, others remain isolated. In a flash of stereotypical slow motion, each story hurtles through a climactic scene, but one that ultimately leaves some questions unresolved.
The themes the movie presents are undoubtedly timely. As victims of cyberbullying who committed suicide have gained national attention in recent weeks, the impact of misuse of technology must be confronted in popular culture. Disconnect’s unfiltered and raw depiction of such problems is a strategy necessary to raise awareness of the pitfalls of technology. Where documentaries or other films water down weighty themes, Disconnect is unafraid to expose lives ripped apart by technology and is better as a result.
In the face of such brilliant exposure, Disconnect falls short of aptly resolving subtle tensions that emerge over the course of its ambitious number of storylines. Even the emotional impact of the climactic scene is lessened by the unresolved nature of various loose ends. Glossing over such themes gives the film the appearance of biting off more than it can chew, but also reminds the audience that unlike most cheap big screen thrillers, plot tidiness is not the most important goal.
In some cases, the themes of a film demand more attention than the story. Disconnect is one of those cases and deserves additional recognition because it chooses to do so at the expense of the interests of the majority of moviegoers (who tend to favor suspense and drama over depressing and real confrontations with societal problems).
Though Disconnect might not attract wide popular support because of its concern with large, weighty themes and comparatively smaller concern with the finer points of plot construction, it is a film that is powerful and eye-opening.

Responses to video of Prof. Sragow
I’ve noticed students making audio recordings of professors without asking, which I also think it is at best impolite and, at worst, a violation of trust. Videotaping an educator and sending an edited video to a smear website is not the rational response of a student who is worried about an uncomfortable learning environment: going to the head of a department or a dean is.
Indeed, secretly taping professors and students is as much a violation of a comfortable learning environment where learning can be pursued without fear or favor as anything the professor did or did not do.
In my life, I have had right-wing and left-wing teachers. I’ve learned from all of them. USC has both left-wing and right-wing guest teachers (their bios rather give the game away to sensitive students). And our tenure-track faculty comprises non-political researchers and academics.
My alma mater of Cambridge is currently dealing with a professor who expresses support for eugenics and expresses racial discrimination on his website. Students complained to the student union and the administration. That’s what you do when you’re genuinely offended. Don’t drag USC’s name through the mud to make cheap political points. Especially when that’s what you are accusing a professor of doing.
And videotaping people without their knowledge is super-sketchy. That’s a point that is always true.
Simon Radford
Graduate Student, Political Science and International Relations
 
As a USC alumnus, it is extremely disappointing to see a professor at my alma mater spewing such vile, biased vitriol in the classroom and calling it education.
Your conduct, and the unvarnished bias you exhibit to students, is prohibitive in working toward creating a healthy educational environment. One could surmise that students taking your class, who may hold opposite political views and values, wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to explore or voice their beliefs in the learning environment you have created in your classroom without the fear being labeled by you in class with a slur or punished in how they are graded.
There are forums off- and on-campus, such as Tommy Trojan at lunch time, for all of us to voice our views in, where people can stop, tune in or tune out and not feel intimidated that their grades or future is reliant on them agreeing with their professor’s bias or not.

As a conservative, USC alumna and former board member of the USC College Republicans, I was less than thrilled to see a video of my former professor Darry Sragow, in the same class that I took, bashing Republicans and making false and disparaging accusations about Republicans.
However, I’m also less than thrilled with the students in the class.
While I do not condone Sragow’s statements, and obviously his comments were over the top (and much more severe than when I was in his class), I think that conservative students need to stand up and engage in debate when their beliefs are challenged. Secretly recording videos to expose a professor, even though his statements were inappropriate, is doing nothing to help the conservative cause.
Sragow always welcomed debate and discussion and approached my comments with a dry sense of humor (that was indeed often partisan). Some students may not be comfortable in such a situation, but I think that students (especially conservative students) need to understand how important voicing their own views is in the classroom.
Emily Schrader
Class of 2012, Former USC College Republicans Chief of Staff
 
Over the past 24 hours, I have watched with a mixture of horror and awe as my professor’s comments from my election law class last semester were broadcast on The O’Reilly Factor and other conservative media outlets.
My objection is not to the reaction to the comments my professor made. While I believe that Professor Sragow encouraged disagreement with his own views in class, I objected to many of the generalizations he used in the video clips. I believe that the Republican Party will not go extinct but will instead play an important role in creating a better future for Americans of all racial makeups.
My objection is to the serendipitous fashion in which his views were revealed. By using a camera to secretly videotape a professor, Tyler Talgo will deprive his fellow students of the real-world political examples and academic security, which enhance the academic experience of Republican and Democratic students alike.
Part of the beauty of learning is that sometimes it comes through failure. In this new technological age, the idea that all of my in-class comments could be secretly recorded and broadcast to future employers through Facebook or the blogosphere is offensive. USC has an obligation to protect their students. No student is going to feel comfortable arguing a new philosophical viewpoint or discussing sensitive issues such as race and gender if their views are not treated with discretion. Talgo’s actions are an affront to his classmates’ trust and academic security, which ultimately facilitates the kind of bipartisan discussion he claims to seek.

This guy is an adjunct brought in with Republicans to tell students about partisan politics. He is not a ‘political scientist’. If the kid didn’t like it he could have chosen to take a class with Guggenheim Award-winning political scientist Lee Epstein who is probably the best scholar in the world on the US Supreme Court. He could have taken a class with Dennis Chong who is one of the best-known political scientists in the country. Matt McCubbins is the best-paid academic in California because he is such a big deal. USC has a pretty damn good political science department. Instead this kid decided to smear the school. And idiots have jumped on their soapboxes, claiming to be Alums, and are happy to throw them under the bus too. I hope this kid enjoys his 15 minutes but he’s hurting my school and that makes me mad. Of course the school has to back Prof Sragow: it starts a terrible precedent with spies in every classroom and rewards a kid who broke the law in taping people without their consent. If this kid had acted like an adult and gone to the department and said that he didn’t feel comfortable, something would have been done. Instead he wanted to play to prejudice. Sad.
So Prof Sragow gets a pass for preaching hate because the kid didn’t get “permission” from his teacher to videotape? He didn’t get “permission” from USC to film hatred, so its his fault.
The University will soon be issuing uniforms and whistles…I am sure you will want one. No, the school does not have to back hatred, they do not have to back Prof Sragow. they could have a backbone and state at this type of hatred is awful and will not be tolerated.
You are missing the point. You don’t video ANYONE. Go make a complaint to the head of department. It is what civilized people do. People who act like adults. This kid clearly wanted his 15 minutes of fame at USC’s expense. Sickening.
If he was not teaching such awful stuff, no one would have videotaped him.
It’s not about videotaping,
It’s about hatred and it should not be tolerated, ever!
This kid secretly taping people and promoting himself on TV should be ashamed of himself. I hope USC kicks him out.
The classroom should be free of indoctrination from the professor, political, religious, right, left or otherwise. The professor should teach the facts, present respective differing views of each issue objectively, and not preach or advocate any position. So how should opinions in the classroom be rendered? Easy.
The  professor should ask the students to present their own views and to defend or critique the perspectives that were objectively presented part of his or her lecture. At this point, students should predominate in presenting their opinions. But if the classroom is a place of free speech, why should the professor not express his or her opinion like the students? Simple.
Students can politely differ with one another without repercussions. But when the professor expresses a political, religious, etc. view, it has the effect of being “approved,” “correct” and “proper,” this makes the students reluctant to state differing views, for fear of bad effects on their grades. Sadly, some professors do not care. They deem it so important to promote their own views that objective teaching and free discussion do not matter. Sad, but true.  I hated to see a professor on TV from my USC shamelessly pushing political views. This was not OK for Herbert Marcuse or Angela Davis of the UC system many years ago, (google them) and it is certainly not OK for USC.
Thank you! Finally common sense has prevailed. Provost, listen to the people! This professor must go!
I wrote to the President and I described my bitter disappointment over the Scragow situation, and of course the Campus Provost wrote almost verbatim what was stated to the Daily Trojan, and I found the whole thing to be odd at least! The issue is not how the Instructor said what he said, it is this, had the exact same Instructor been an Old Angry White Guy who made statements that African-Americans & Hispanics were dumb and lazy, and that Michelle Obama was this, and Michelle Obama was that, how fast would the Student Body would have reacted and how fast would that Instructor have been dismissed? The whole thing is most disappointing and hypocritical!
This person was caught teaching really hateful stuff. The issue is not about videotaping, the issue is about this unqualified teacher. By the way, videotaping and recording is done all the time in the workplace.
Indeed. Also, the videotaping is really the only way this student could fight back, when the professor and Provost are clearly turning a blind eye to hate speech. It’s mindboggling that this is going on in a classroom of all places.
USC has lost all crediblity, and is not teaching its students.
As an alum I am very disapointed and will no longer donate any money to this school.

Meet Yolanda Spivey: a vibrant and educated young woman in her 20s with more than a decade of experience in the insurance industry. During those that span, she worked as an assessor, broker and manager of other employees. She did well in her field too, with a client base including not just individuals but also small businesses and commercial enterprises.
This was all until she lost her job in late 2009.
Hailey Nowak | Daily Trojan
 
Despite this, one would think that a woman with her resume and experience would be quick to pick up a new job, even in a market as tipsy as the insurance industry in 2009.
Yet she didn’t. According to a personal essay on Techyville.com, she continued being unemployed for more than two years after her layoff. In total, Spivey applied for more than 300 jobs in her industry. Each of the more than 300 jobs she applied for considered her an unsuitable fit for the job posted.
So Spivey elected to do something different one week. Instead of using her name when she went through her weekly application spring, she created an alter ego of sorts under the pseudonym “Bianca White.” The resume and work experience for White and Spivey were identical, as was the contact information, education and history. White and Spivey were identical on paper insofar as one difference: Their races.
Monster.com, the resource Spivey had been using to apply for jobs, has a diversity questionnaire that users are required to fill out. When she originally created her Monster.com profile, Spivey answered that she is black. After hearing no response for so long, she decided to change her response on the questionnaire from “Black” to “Decline to state.” This change made no difference in the (lack) of responses to her application. However, she listed her alter-ego as being “White” on the questionnaire.
Monster.com says that the questionnaire has no connection to job selection, and is purely for informational purposes only.
Nevertheless, in the week that “Bianca” applied for jobs in the insurance industry, she received exactly nine phone calls and seven emails with job offers. On the other hand, Spivey — who has exactly the same credentials, experience and education as the white Bianca — received zero phone calls and only two emails, each of which was for a commission-only job that demanded she move out of state.
The results speak for themselves: It is apparently easier to get a job if you are white than if you are black. Statistics support with this sentiment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the March 2013 white unemployment rate was 6.7 percent. In contrast, black unemployment rate is slightly less than double that, reading at 13.3 percent. The same trend is reflected among youth (defined as ages 16-19), who traditionally are employed at lower rates than their older counterparts. The March numbers for white youth unemployment read 22.5 percent. The unemployment rate for black youth is 33.8 percent.
Even though this issue isn’t as black and white as these statistics, the numbers are still troubling to see.
Academic studies confirm that this gap is indeed more than just a mistake of statistics. For example, a study published in 2009 by Devah Pager, a professor of sociology at Princeton University, found that “a young black man with a clean record does no better in his search for low wage work than a white man with a felony conviction.”
Discrimination in the workforce is nothing new for those who have to live with it. Many of the commenters on Spivey’s original article, posted on Techyville.com and Clutch Online Magazine, recall having similar experiences. Others even have conducted the same “experiment” themselves, with similar outcomes.
Spivey’s experiment provides something important that we can all take away: Workforce discrimination still exists in post-civil rights movement America. High unemployment of any group is not good for the country as a whole, as that represents a body of disengaged citizens that share common challenges in finding work. One can only wonder what the economic outlook for the United States would be like if all Americans were given equal employment opportunity.
