We all have preferences when it comes to dating, whether it be a preference for a more athletic partner than someone more academically focused, or preferring someone with facial hair over someone without it. But there are some who have incredibly specific racial preferences for a partner, explicitly stating what races they would and would not date, based on little to no personal reasoning. This brings up the question of whether you can actually have racial preferences for dating, or if “preferences” simply mask our racial prejudice. 
Not all racial preferences are inherently biased. For example, many of my first-generation immigrant friends tell me that they would prefer to date someone within their own culture and religion, as they are integral components of their lives. In addition, some groups would prefer to date someone within their own race to avoid the fetishization that often occurs within interracial relationships. However, preference quickly turns into prejudice when people make blanket statements, such as “I could never see myself dating an Asian man,” or “I’m just not attracted to Black women; I prefer white women.” These blanket statements are usually founded on subconscious racial stereotypes, such as associating South Asian men with a nerdier background, or Black women with higher levels of aggression and hypersexuality. 
When you say that you just will not date someone from a certain race, you assume that there is something that unites every person of this race that makes them inherently unattractive. To say that you will not date a Black man, for example, assumes that all other things aside, you refuse to date anyone with that skin color, or assume that all Black men have some sort of common feature that you find inherently unattractive.
Additionally, saying that you would only want to date Black men or Asian women, for example, is not necessarily a compliment for the racial groups being “desired.” Historically, marginalized groups were notoriously undesired, due to commonly held beliefs of their ethnic inferiority. Therefore, to want to exclusively date someone in these historically unpalatable groups might be seen as a successful social milestone. However, it is usually a symptom of the overfetishization of a certain group. 
Those who “prefer” Black men tend to associate them with overly masculine characteristics, such as a large, muscular body and the stereotype of larger genitals. A preference for Asian women is usually a result of the stereotype that Asian women are smaller, exotic and submissive. With these specific “preferences,” people of certain races are often seen as nothing more than a body, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes and violent relationships. Black women’s bodies were historically oversexualized by European colonizers, which in their minds justified their prolonged abuse and enslavement. 
Stereotypes and fetishization extends beyond basic racial categories as well. Skin color, hair types and other individual features can also be tools to justify harmful stereotypes and unfair biases while dating, including the masculinization of darker skin, or the objectification of blondes. The distinction between darker-skinned Southeast Asians and lighter-skinned East Asians demonstrates how these subcategories can play a role in dating stereotypes. Southeast Asian men — from regions such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines — tend to be seen as more delinquent and toxic compared to the model minority myth projected on East Asian men. When we label these groups as toxic or inherently bad partners, it essentially becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where groups might internalize the stereotypes, and justify and glorify toxic behaviors. 
Stereotypes that are commonly associated with different races largely stem from media representation, including comments and characterizations on TV shows and movies, news sources, advertisements, the porn industry and other major media forms. 
Hollywood has a large history of problematic portrayals of minority groups in films and television. For example, we often see representations of Black people as overly sexual and animalistic, which can be incredibly impactful when it comes to how they are ultimately viewed as a group in real life, leading to the objectification they can experience in relationships. 
One of the largest contributors to these stereotypes, however, is the porn industry. With categories based on racial qualities, the idea that certain groups of people are meant to be objectified in different “sexual fantasies” prevails, no matter how much people try to justify the idea that its unrealisticness and fantasticality is a well-known reality among those who engage with pornographical representations of minorities. 
We need to start examining our own biases when it comes to attraction to better acknowledge how our preferences can be shaped by harmful stereotypes and categorization of minorities into monolithic groups and to reduce the barriers to dating that these stereotypes uphold. Having preferences is part of being human but having those preferences at the expense of others is not.

One of my core memories is of a sunny day in my second grade classroom. Light streamed through the open windows, and I sat with my legs crossed next to my classmates on the floor in front of my teacher as he read us a book. I can’t remember what the book was about, but I remember my teacher closing the book after he finished and telling us that we should never strive for perfection because we would never be satisfied. 
That lesson was not a unique one by any means, but it’s one that has always stuck out to me — mainly because I’ve never fully learned it to this day. 
I realized pretty quickly after that day that I would never become perfect, but I also found that it wasn’t too difficult for me to pretend I was. As I grew older, my ambition towards becoming perfect shifted into an ambition towards seeming perfect. 
And so began my lifestyle of making decisions and participating in experiences to craft an outward perception of a life that appeared perfect. Taking and excelling in AP courses in high school was important to me, but not as important as appearing “smart” and “put together.” Getting asked on dates is nice, but not as nice as appearing “desirable” and “romantically interesting.” Being involved in strenuous extracurricular activities is something I love, but I don’t love that as much as appearing “busy” and “capable.” 
And if someone, at least from the outside, looks like they’re smart, desirable or capable, how could they not be satisfied with that? 
I suppose this even manifests itself in my decision to be a journalist, as the commitment to objectivity in reporting erases any hint of myself in my work. When I shift attention away from myself and to the subjects I’m highlighting in the articles I write, it feels like no one is paying attention to me and the flaws I’ve tried so hard to conceal. 
In this way, it’d be accurate to say I spend a lot of my life feeding off others. The images people construct of me in their minds have begun to shape the person I am, which is an incredibly backwards way of forming an identity and sense of self. 
It’s almost like extrinsic validation — compliments and accolades act as my life currency. When I make a decision based on something I hope others will like about me, my outer image becomes grander and more extravagant, while my inner self loses more and more value. 
But if my identity is solely built around the boxes that people place me into, where is the box that I, as an individual, created for myself? If my actions are dictated just based on the ways I think people perceive me, what room does that leave for me to decide my actions based on how I think and feel? 
I’ve been thinking about this and doing a lot of self-reflection lately, so the timing of this installment of “Editor’s Epilogue” honestly couldn’t have come at a better time. As I think about who I am in combination with my goals of perfection — both what is real and what is perceived — I can’t help but feel as if my efforts to be everything that I think everyone else wants me to be has made me feel the farthest from this goal I’ve been stretching myself so far to reach. 
I don’t want to live for others. I refuse to believe that my sole purpose in life is to create a flawless image of myself, thereby eradicating all of the imperfections that shape me into my truest form. 
I know I’m not perfect, and I suppose I now know that I don’t need to try to be. I’ve even realized that perhaps the closest I’ll ever get to this notion of perfection is being honest and genuine with myself, and by living a life I’ve constructed with myself as my top priority. 
Writing this was really hard for me because it feels like I’ve chosen to dismantle the carefully curated perfect image of myself that I’ve spent a large chunk of my life creating. I feel scared and vulnerable — which are emotions my outwardly perfect self would never want to reveal. But maybe this column was my first step towards the beginning of a new lifestyle — one where the only validation I crave is the satisfaction I find within myself. 
“Editors’ Epilogue” is a rotating column featuring a new Daily Trojan editor in each installment and their personal experiences of living in what seems to be an irrepressible dumpster fire of a world.

Three of the seven state propositions on this year’s ballot will pass, the Associated Press projects: Prop 1, which will enshrine the right to abortion in the state’s constitution; Prop 28, which will fund arts and music education in public schools; and Prop 31, which will uphold a 2020 law banning the sale of certain flavored tobacco products. The rest — Prop 26 and 27, on allowing sports betting; Prop 29, on regulating kidney dialysis clinics; and Prop 30, on an electric vehicle incentive tax — are projected to fail.
The Daily Trojan spoke with students and panelists at the Election Day Watch Party at Wallis Annenberg Hall, hosted by the USC Center for the Political Future Tuesday night, when most propositions were too early to call. General consensus among those interviewed, however, was that the results were widely expected.
Prop 1: Yes, AP Projects
Noelia Rodriguez, a panelist at the event and Fall 2022 CPF fellow, told the Daily Trojan that the passing of the proposition was a “personal thing,” having been a student herself at the time of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.
“It memorializes what the people in our state really believe, and that is the right to choice,” said Rodriguez, who formerly served as Los Angeles deputy mayor and director of communications for First Lady Laura Bush. “I know [what] having access to safe child healthcare and preventative measures meant to young women — and quite frankly, their partners … This is a way to enshrine that in our state constitution.”
Prop 1 was also about sending a message to other states: Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the measure a mere three days after Dobbs v. Jackson overturned the Roe precedent — in addition to legislation signed the day of, preventing “radical attempts by other states to extend their anti-abortion laws into California,” according to a Jun. 24 press release from Newsom’s office.
“More than anything, it’s to send a message that California is pro-abortion rights,” said Muna Shikaki, a panelist and adjunct instructor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. “And on the other hand, it’s also a great way to get people to vote during a midterm election where usually there’s not very high turnout.”
Alex Flores, a freshman majoring in public relations and a registered Democrat, said he voted in support of Prop 1.
“Not only for women, but for anyone that has a uterus, seeing discrepancies against their choice was upsetting,” said Flores, who lobbied with Planned Parenthood for the measure. “When you come [to the U.S.], you have an expectation that everyone’s going to be respected. And when people are not being respected, that to me is not upholding an American value.”
Prop 26: No, AP Projects
Both gambling-related propositions, together the most expensive ballot initiative effort to date, overwhelmingly failed. Disapproval of the measures was bipartisan: state Republicans and Democrats declined to openly support either Prop 26 or 27. Opinions among students interviewed, however, were mixed, despite some of them not being of gambling age.
“I voted [for Prop 26] because I am native to my land and I know that it’s a little bit of a struggle to get funding from states here,” Flores said. “Of course, we know that for a lot of Native American peoples and tribes, casinos are a big way for them to make money, and they already do not get much help from the state. They only get tax-exempt land, which is a help, but not the best help.”
Prop 27: No, AP Projects
James Peters, a freshman majoring in political science and a registered Democrat, said he believes Trojan Football’s recent comeback could garner support for gambling at USC.
“Especially in my dormitory, a lot of people are in favor of Prop 27 because sports betting is very popular out of state, and right now they’re doing it [in California] through illegal means,” Peters said. “So specifically, with USC gaining more traction with a better football team, I feel like it could, in a sense, increase favor for Proposition 27.”
David Cerna, a freshman majoring in piano performance and a registered Republican, voted against the measure.
“[Prop] 27 in particular was a big one for me,” Cerna said. “It would virtually allow for any mobile device to become a gambling device. The way I view it, whenever you put something like that into an app on a phone, it automatically puts the mind that, ‘Oh, this is a game’ … and you don’t realize that what you’re using up is your actual money. You can lose your whole life’s savings.”
Prop 28: Yes, AP Projects
Prop 28 is expected to overwhelmingly pass, being what Shikaki called a “safe proposition” for voters. The measure will direct $1 billion dollars in state funds to arts and music education programs in public schools slashed during the 2008 financial crisis, disproportionately affecting low-income communities.
“I grew up during a time where a lot of art docent and garden docent programs were getting cut by the state,” said Eleanor Love, a freshman majoring in public policy and a registered Democrat who voted for the measure. “So I think it’s important that younger students especially are able to be exposed to the arts and music and that sort of thing.”
Flores, a dance instructor, similarly said he took his personal experience into consideration in voting for the measure.
“There is a reason why no one is against the arts,” Flores said. “It is vital to teach our children in school. The arts [are] just as vital as any STEM [or] English class. You’re letting children express themselves creatively and letting children explore issues with their own creative will, and find creative answers to complex issues.”
Prop 29: No, AP Projects
“They’ve tried to do this before and it’s failed, and they’re trying again and it’s likely to fail — again,” Shikaki said of Prop 29, which would impose regulations on kidney dialysis clinics. 
Her prediction was true: AP on Wednesday projected the measure will fail, with 69.9% of ballots counted at the time of publication having voted “no.” A similar proposition in 2020, Prop 23, overwhelmingly failed, with 63.42% voting no. A 2018 proposition, Prop 8, to impose patient refund requirements on clinics also failed, with 59.93% voting no.
Prop 30: No, AP Projects
Responding to an audience question during the watch party panel, Ira Reiner, a Fall 2022 USC CPF fellow and former L.A. district attorney, said of Prop 30, “I was — I am — against it.” Reiner went on to criticize the ballot initiative system as a once democratic system that has since been corrupted by corporate money.
“What’s really wrong with the initiative process is that it is no longer citizen-driven,” Reiner said. “It is driven by very, very, very large money, [pushing] matters that should go through the legislature, go through the committee process — where there can be amendments, there can be witnesses that are brought in, and the final product is never exactly the same as was initially reported.”
Prop 30 is the second ballot measure in the last few years to have had significant financial backing from rideshare company Lyft. The first was in 2020, when Prop 22 became the most expensive ballot measure in California history as gig companies poured money to fight against the measure. (This year’s Props 26 and 27 combined have since taken the lead as the most expensive measure.)
Prop 31: Yes, AP Projects
Love said Prop 31 was of major concern for her and her friends, considering the popularity of flavored tobacco products among younger voters.
“Some of my friends were texting me and saying, ‘Vote no on 31 so I can still buy vapes,’” Love said. “I just noticed that a lot of people my age are addicted to it. I was in eighth grade or seventh grade when kids my age started using flavored tobacco and vape products … and I just feel like kids should not have access to that.”

When I was younger, I used to make weird faces at all times of day; at the barre in ballet, in family photos — sorry, Mom — and would even aggressively furrow my brows when taking tests in class. I liked that it made people laugh, but my teachers would always warn me that I would develop wrinkles early on and look 60 by the time I was 20. 
While I’m happy to report that I look my age, I still hear these fears of aging everywhere. My friends are frantically trying new sunscreens, comparing the collagen levels of the products instead of their costs, and the amount of times I’ve heard about baby botox and small fillers is too many to count. I understand the fear completely, and I believe it’s valid, but that was — and still isn’t — my fear. 
Instead, I am afraid of my closet aging. 
I’m not talking about aging in the sense of garments being worn past the point of repair or aging as in dressing “too old” or “too young” — style is ageless and constantly progressive; frankly, it makes me upset when people stop exploring because they feel they are too old for the garments they are drawn to. Instead, I’m talking about aging in the sense that my clothes don’t suit my future anymore. 
Since college started, the emphasis on my career and its possibilities has only been amplified. So, in an attempt to compete for internships and LinkedIn connections, the way I shopped changed. It was no longer “How can I style this?” and “Where would I wear this?,” but rather, “Can I wear this in an office?” and “Would I feel comfortable wearing this to a networking event?”
Ever since I was young, I knew I needed my career to be exciting. And while my ambitions aren’t necessarily to be Hannah Montana anymore, I understood that a desk job that was all too similar to “The Office” would be a nightmare for me. Thus, I chose my majors and jobs accordingly; cybersecurity provides a new challenge every day, public relations feels like a puzzle I get to work and rework, and athletics is nothing short of exciting, from meeting Olympians to working game days. 
But during a midnight TikTok scroll, I stumbled across one of my favorite style gurus, Mira Al-Momani: influencer, stylist and founder of nimastore. I thought, “She’s so lucky she can dress like that because of her job.” I decided in that split second that because her job was creative and non-corporate, it meant she could continue to express herself that way, but I knew immediately that my thinking was outdated. 
Of course, that doesn’t mean I am going to show up to my corporate internship in the Diesel belt mini-skirt and a NoDress poodle top, but I shouldn’t have to give up total individual style because I am heading in the direction of more (in comparison to Al-Momani’s industry) corporate America. After all, weekends and nights still exist. Even then, the workplace is changing. Especially post-pandemic, many offices still offer completely remote positions or have relaxed dress codes to more business casual attire. 
I think that instead of seeking compromise, I need to seek balance. I can have my cake and eat it too, especially if I spend four years making it. And, I can follow Al-Momani and keep exploring fashion in the professional chapter of my life because fashion is for the individual. My style is, and will forever be, for me, about me and focused on my own creative expression. Yours should be too. 
So yes, get that pencil skirt or pair of slacks, but don’t forget to pick up a fun pair of shoes or a flirty dress every once in a while. Our clothes will outlive us and, one day, tell our story — what do you want yours to say about you? 
It’s up to you… and your shopping cart.

USC students now have access to UWill, a virtual program that will provide quick access to mental health professionals, officials announced Nov. 3. 
“This is a good option for you if you would like to connect with a mental health professional within a very quick turnaround time,” the USC Student Health Counseling and Mental Health Services Team wrote in an email statement about the service. “Typically, after eligibility is confirmed, you can sign in and choose an appointment that takes place within 24-48 hours.” 
The UWill service launched Oct. 17 to ensure that students get the help they need during “high tide season” — a time of year when therapy appointments are more difficult to get, said Broderick Leaks, director of counseling and mental health at USC Student Health. 
“It really helps us when we get into the middle of the semester — where we start reaching our saturation point — to be able to partner with a company like UWill that can increase access and provide immediate care to our students who are seeking out services,” Leaks said.
Danielle Gautt, the assistant director for outreach and prevention services at Student Health, said that UWill could be useful for students who are curious about therapy, feel more comfortable receiving help from professionals outside of USC or who may not otherwise have access to immediate care.
“The beauty about those services is they’re accessible on your phone 100% remote, and you can use them when you’re not on campus,” Gautt said. “For those students who are considering entering mental health support or therapeutic services, and let’s say they’re about to go abroad, I would recommend accessing UWill as a source of support.”
To use the service, students first need to access their MySHR Portal, where they can schedule an appointment and select the category “Counseling and Mental Health.” Then, they can choose the “UWill” tab and send in their request. 
More than half of UWill’s providers identify as Black and Indigenous people and people of color, and about a quarter identify as LGBTQIA, Leaks said. 
UWill is the first of many products that USC Health officials plan to provide to students through their Therapy+ suite — a collection of applications and services curated to meet the vast array of students’ mental health needs. They also plan to add services like the Oasis app, a service that will provide psychoeducation through self-paced modules and allow students to directly message trained mental health specialists. 
“USC has undergone a pretty massive expansion of mental health care and services, … we are [now] one of the largest, if not the largest, university counseling center in the country,” Leaks said.
Gautt added that Therapy+ aims to provide “those services that students may need to really engage in wellness and wellbeing but don’t quite rise to the level of ‘I need to come in for individual intake’ or ‘I need to see a psychiatrist.’”
Rachel Lichtman, the associate director of public communications at USC Student Health, said these new programs will be rolled out in stages over the remainder of the academic school year. As for next steps, Leaks said that the goal is to try and inform the student body about these new services to provide as much access to the care they need. 
“COVID really opened up the world to more telehealth care,” Leaks said. “Just being able to access a therapist — whether it’s a USC therapist at Counseling and Mental Health Services or UWill therapist — being able to access them from home or in a place that’s convenient for you versus having to travel to the counseling center or travel to a location, I think, has just really opened up the doors and lot of access for our students.”

We’ve all been shunned for our music taste at some point. Maybe you admitted to liking K-pop or mentioned how much you adore Taylor Swift’s new album. Unfortunately, pretentious music snobs are perpetually itching to strike up a conversation about their favorite artists, just so they can hit you with the classic, “Oh, you wouldn’t have heard of them. They’re pretty underground.” Fortunately for you, I’ve compiled six phenomenal artists with under 100,000 Spotify monthly listeners so next time, you can have the last elitist laugh.
chemical club
Taking polaroid photos, driving with the windows down on the beach at night, stargazing with an old friend — this is the vibe encapsulated by the music of chemical club, an indie-pop duo from Truth Or Consequences, New Mexico (yes, it’s a real place). Eric Graham and Michael Watson unite their talents to summon their signature nostalgic sound, exploring the human condition through their raw, heartfelt lyricism.
Naked vocals, soft synths and mellow guitar characterize a majority of chemical club’s music, producing a cool, nebulous aura. “jade” and “the last one” stick to this mold, achieving that indicative wistful feeling the duo is known for. If you’re searching for an artist to throw you back to the good ol’ days, chemical club is perfect for you.
GALASO
Hailing from Austin, Texas, Jacob Galaso harnesses the power of psychedelic rock, R&B and pop to conjure an unbeatable sonic experience. GALASO’s beats wash the listener with a refreshing sense of ease, while lazy synth-pop vibes weave throughout the chords. 
His 2020 single “Sinking” personifies his honey sweet style, with his dreamy vocals and electronic instrumentals coming together in a viscous harmony to suspend his audience in molten melody. “Little Sunshine,” a song off GALASO’s debut Extended Play, “Around the Sun,” furthers his musical identity with computerized strings, twinkling guitar and a smooth voice. Looking for an unforgettable audio trip? Check out GALASO.
Long Beard
Leslie Bear, artistically known as Long Beard, makes music for sentimental folks, bottling the warm, fuzzy feeling of home and burying it in her clean guitar chords, bright snares and heavenly vocals. Bear’s lyricism sets her apart as she paints vivid imagery of her past relationships and old suburbia home, reminiscing on times past, with each song highlighting a different facet of her childhood and teenage years.
“Means To Me” offers soft, creamy vocals mixed with sweet, smooth guitar, while “Snow Globe” introduces synths to Bear’s gloomy discography. Those who enjoy the work of Phoebe Bridgers and Novo Amor will adore Long Beard.
Tinta China
Despite the overwhelming number of bands that dissolved throughout quarantine, Tinta China did quite the opposite, forming their group midway through 2020. The Chile-based indie-pop group is composed of members olavinhe, Antonia Brante, Felipe Espinoza and Nicooco, each playing a different instrument and role in the group’s creative process and performance. Chill vibes abound when blasting this band’s music, instantaneously generating a carefree atmosphere, despite their songs’ dark lyrics. 
“Invencible” and “El sol,” both tracks off the band’s 2022 album “Todo menos el presente,” flaunt the group’s precise drum and guitar skills while swaddling the songs in lovely choral backing vocals. Tinta China’s tunes will certainly get your foot tapping, so don’t forget to add their music to your playlist.
La Bouquet
Though La Bouquet is now disbanded, their music still accomplishes the goal the duo set for themselves upon formation: to make music that’ll make you feel. Bryan Sammis and Drew Bruchs wanted to produce wistful tunes you can dance to while remembering what used to be. Embracing the imperfections of both themselves and their music, the two composed numerous heart wrenching tracks steeped in nostalgia.
Consistent with their mission, their track “Sad People Dancing” featuring Olivver the Kid is exactly what it sounds like: an upbeat, melancholy song employing pulsating drums and breathy singing that tells your head to dance but your heart to weep. “Loser Baby,” however, is a funky song with a quirky guitar melody and chorus that punches straight to the gut. Though we won’t be receiving any new music from La Bouquet, their existing discography should never be overlooked and certainly deserves a listen. 
The Volunteers
Based in South Korea, The Volunteers draw inspiration from notable acts like The Beatles, Avril Lavigne and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while incorporating their individualistic values into their alternative sound. The members, Yerin Baek, Hyungseok Koh, Chiheon Kim and Jonny, came together under a shared notion of rebellion, looking to infuse the modern grunge-rock scene with their exceptional synergy. 
“Violet” clearly mirrors The Volunteers’ concentrated ‘90s rock inspiration as brutal guitar riffs splatter crimson red and electric purple tones across the track. In contrast, the group displays the versatility of their talents with their song “Summer,” introducing far more mellow energy to their ruthless debut album. If you love The Cranberries or The Cardigans, be sure to check out The Volunteers.
With these recommendations, I hope you too can feel just as superior as the next music snob. In all seriousness though, continue supporting underrated musical talent — quality does not necessarily equate to instant popularity, and maybe one day your streams will help propel a deserving artist into the public eye.

A topsy-turvy  Week 9 in the NFL upended the Most Valuable Player race with a couple of upsets and close victories. Kansas City Chiefs signal-caller, Patrick Mahomes, put the team on his back with over 500 yards of total offense and a team-record 43 completions to edge out the Tennessee Titans in overtime. The New York Jets delivered a hard hit to Buffalo Bills’ quarterback Josh Allen’s elbow and his pursuit of a first league MVP with their 20-17 win at MetLife Stadium last Sunday. In Philadelphia, Thursday Night Football saw the Eagles dispatch the basement-dwelling Houston Texans, thanks to another interception-free game from third-year quarterback Jalen Hurts.
BetMGM updated the odds for the league’s top individual honor after the last slate of games, slotting Mahomes in as the favorite at +225. Allen fell from his perch at the top to +250, matching Hurts’ current odds. With the Chiefs and Bills locked in a battle for the bye week in the American Football Conference and Hurts’ Eagles running away with the National Football Conference, the race looks unlikely to cool down anytime soon. 
Let’s break it down.
Jalen Hurts
We’ll start with the most obvious candidate: the best player on the league’s most successful team. Hurts has made a leap this year, coming into his own as the leader of the undefeated Eagles. He’s second in the league in average yards per throw, second in passer rating and sixth in completion percentage. Hurts passes the eye test too, showing a command of the offense that hasn’t been there in years past.
Despite a breakthrough year, the numbers just aren’t quite there yet for the Alabama product. His 12 total touchdowns lag far behind the league’s top quarterbacks, and his 2,042 yards put him at tenth overall, a yard ahead of Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff. Despite being a former number 1 pick, Goff isn’t exactly the company you want your starting quarterback sharing. Still, if the Eagles finish the season undefeated or with a single loss, it’ll be hard to vote against their captain.
Josh Allen
Josh Allen is the man with a cannon for an arm and pistons for legs. He ranks near the top of a whole host of passing stats. He’s probably a better ball carrier than any running back the Chiefs have on their roster, and he’s got a head-to-head win against them to prove it. Allen’s hurdling defenders, slinging deep balls to wide receiver Stefon Diggs and the Bills are humming along at 6-2, a record that’s good for top of the AFC. What gives?
Allen’s elbow may be what gives (out). That joint may be the single most important factor in this year’s MVP race. After Sunday’s game against the Jets, Allen said “there’s some slight pain, but we’ll get through it.” If Allen can’t power through and has to miss next week’s clash against the 7-1 Minnesota Vikings (or potentially even longer), his MVP case probably won’t get through it either. While backup quarterback Case Keenum has had his moments in the league, the Bills aren’t the Bills without Allen. They’ll be hoping for a quick return from their star to fend off the Chiefs in the race for the top seed in their conference.
Patrick Mahomes
‘How will Patrick Mahomes fare without Tyreek Hill?’ asked pundits across the country. It turns out he’ll fare just fine. Mahomes leads the league in passing yards and touchdowns. He’s winning games on the ground and in the air. With an almost nonexistent run game, Mahomes has had to become a workhorse passer, with 68 attempts in their last game alone. Somehow, it looks like Mahomes might be even better without his marquee receiver. He’s still doing ridiculous things, but now he’s mixing in a steady diet of short check-downs to a receiving core that is wearing down defenses by commission.
If the Chiefs outpace the Bills over the second half of the season, it’ll be hard to overlook the league’s statistical king. The Eagles might have a better record, but MVP cases are often built on narratives, and Hurts just doesn’t have a very compelling one. Without Hurts, the Eagles are still a solid team on the strength of a competitive defense. Without Mahomes, the Chiefs are toast.

If you don’t consider Ra Oblivion a household (dormhold?) name, it’s easy to assume that you haven’t completed your yassification journey yet. Saturated in a punk Vivienne Westwood aesthetic, Ra Oblivion has descended on the USC community to begin her reign as high priestess to everything beautiful. 
If you’re not familiar with drag, the art expression has a rich history that can be traced back to Shakespearean theater, and unsurprisingly, the oppressive rule of the church at the time. However, it’s not a stretch to say that the church actually played a part in creating drag! Due to their rule that only men were allowed to perform on stage, the church implicitly encouraged men at the time to find their inner slay by donning a different gender expression. 
In the modern day, drag has taken the world by storm, expanding outside just the theater space to an artistic performance of gender expression. One of these performance artists is Saneel Sharma, a sophomore majoring in design who happens to make a very convincing “sexy alien… who happens to be Indian.”
As one of Hayward, Calif.’s biggest exports (along with other less notable figures such as Dwayne Johnson and USC alumna Saweetie), Sharma discovered Ra while in the Hayward Unified School District. 
“I was taking art classes in high school and my art teacher, Carrie King, had a bunch of drag queen posters on her wall. I was so amazed by and questioning the [queer imagery] I saw in her classroom,” Ra said. “And that’s where she introduced me to drag and immediately I was hooked. I started drag when I started learning about it, because that’s how invested I was into being part of that culture.”
Since then, Ra Oblivion has seen a fierce come-up at USC, where her artistry has found a home. At last year’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly-hosted Annual Drag Show, Ra Oblivion met then director Sasha Urban, who helped her find opportunities to perform. 
“I’ve been just taking the opportunities, but recently I’ve been actually going out and being involved in [the] community by dressing in drag even if I’m not performing… to show that I am interested in being part of their show,” Ra said. “How I’m still getting gigs is by going out and interacting with people in the community and actually further solidifying a name in the [Los Angeles] drag scene.”
Though Ra Oblivion has bided her time as an up-and-coming artist, she can recount her struggle with validation from the wider drag community. When queens Bombae and Kiara from Canada’s Drag Race began following Ra on Instagram, she found herself gaining recognition from her local community. However, she also felt that “they only took me seriously by seeing that I was followed by verified people.”
For an artist who sees drag as a career, Ra Oblivion has spent a lot of time grappling with these ideas of recognition and validation. Visually, Ra is the oeuvre of her influences, ranging from the alluring Bollywood characters of her childhood to the rich furies of Alexander McQueen. There is a complexity to the expression itself, and yet the validation of queer art — which has recently been a widely-discussed topic — has deeper connections to Saneel. 
“There’s been a shift where the more I dressed up as Ra, the more I wondered how comfortable I would feel slowly implicating feminine characteristics of myself out of drag. And right now, I’m in this current stage of my gender where I feel between being genderfluid and trans-fem,” Ra said. “I don’t think I would have realized that if I didn’t dress up as Ra. I don’t think Saneel would have realized how femininity feels the most natural to them.”
As the creative director of QuASA’s 2023 Annual Drag Show, Ra Oblivion has transitioned from student to mentor.
“Ra actually does a lot of gigs outside of just USC. They’ve had a lot of professional experience to drag, which makes it less of a hobby and much more of an actual career,” said Anh Nguyen, Ra’s colleague. “They bring more seriousness to drag. Ra’s very helpful to other drag queens, especially aspiring drag queens.”
Ra Oblivion shows no signs of stopping at just this upcoming event. The queen has plans to compete in “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and dive into fashion and beauty endeavors.
“I have nothing but admiration for Ra Oblivion. She is an incredibly talented performer, makeup artist, wig artist and she is elevating college drag with everything that she does,” QuASA executive director Hannah Gardiner, known as Daisy Darling, said. “I’m really lucky to have her on our show and to have her support as a director.” 
 Whether you’re just getting to know drag or are an Oblivionator, Ra is an incomparable force of nature to look out for. To experience the magic of Ra Oblivion in person, mark your calendars for the 2023 Annual Drag Show on Jan. 28.
“I want to show the power of being queer and Indian and hyper feminine all at once and truly making a career out of that,” Ra said. “Other Indian kids in my position or my age that are male, they’re taught to be doctors and they’re told to not take an artistic path and I want to make the legacy of truly being comfortable with how you want to live your life.”

The No. 3 Trojans head to Westwood, Calif. to face crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA Friday in their final conference matchup of the season. USC currently holds a 15-5 record as they finish off the regular season and approach the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation finals. 
After a crucial win against No. 4 Stanford at home last month, the Trojans are eager to take on competition and end MPSF Conference play on a high note. USC took down the Cardinal 19-14, with a team high 5 goals from redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt tied his goals per game career-high, as well as climbed to the number eight slot in USC Men’s Water Polo all-time scoring with 164 goals. 
Alongside Ehrhardt in lead scoring was senior driver Marcus Longton and redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen, who have scored in 19 and 16 games this season respectively. Graduate student driver Massimo Di Martire came out with 4 goals against the Cardinal, propelling him into his fourth MPSF Newcomer of the Week award this season. Utility Andrej Grgurevic’s six-on-five score helped secure the win against the Cardinal, and also marked the true freshman’s 19th goal of the season. 
The 19 goals scored by USC against Stanford were the most the Cardinal has given up against a team this season, and the most the Trojans have scored against Stanford in history. This was USC’s first time facing the Cardinal this season, but it will likely not be the last. 
As USC prepares to face the Bruins for the third time this season, they are anxious for a win as the previous two matchups have resulted in close losses. According to Ehrhardt, these losses have been due to USC faltering in the final moments of the game, not their skill in the water. 
“I think for this weekend, especially going into their pool, we’ve got to commit to sticking with the game plan the entire game,” Ehrhardt said. “Last time, we kind of got away from that, and we allowed ourselves to play into their game in the fourth quarter.” 
Longton also expressed the importance of finishing games strongly.
“It was a lot of us playing really well until the last couple of seconds and then losing our composure, losing our focus,” said Longton. “We’ve worked really hard to really focus on that crunchtime, those last five seconds of defense to really focus when it matters the most.” 
Their first contest back in September ended 6-8, despite two last minute goals by the Trojans attempting to come back from behind. Their second matchup, ending 12-13, had the Trojans and the Bruins in an intense back-and-forth toss-up for all four quarters. The Bruins snuck ahead in the final quarter to take the win, pushing them just one slot ahead of USC in the MPSF AP polls. 
“This game is huge. It’s going to allow us to have confidence going into the conference tournament here at home. It’s going to give us a lot of momentum,” Ehrhardt said. “Whatever happens this weekend, we’re going to be able to learn a lot… High pressure and big games like this always make a difference.” 
The Trojans are hungry for a win against their rival, and an upset this weekend has the potential to make waves across the top slots in the MPSF conference. UC Berkeley still holds the top spot in the conference as defending champions from last season, but second and third place titles going into the final MPSF tournament could shift with a USC upset over UCLA. 
“We’re extremely confident,” Longton said. “I think that we’ve been practicing incredibly well, and our team has only been improving throughout the year.” 
The Trojans will face off against the Bruins Friday at 1:00 p.m. at Spieker Aquatics Center, then return home on Nov. 18, 19 and 20, where USC will be hosting the 2022 MPSF Men’s Water Polo Championship.
