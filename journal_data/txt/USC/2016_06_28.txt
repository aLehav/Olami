Former USC volleyball star Samantha Bricio has been nominated for a 2016 ESPY Award for Best College Female Athlete.
The 6’2” outside hitter from Guadalajara, Mexico graduated last May with a degree in psychology. After being chosen as an AVCA All-American for the third time in her career, being named 2015 Player of the Year and receiving the Honda Sports Award, Bricio has a chance now to add another award to her resume.
She holds four records for the USC women’s volleyball program: kills (2,095), attacks (5,499), service aces (301) and points (2,546.5). In her senior season, she led the country in points (803), points per set (6.18) and service aces (86). Bricio will start her professional career with the Italian champions of Imoco Conegliano Volley, where she will play in the European Champions League as well.
The award ceremony show is set for Wednesday, July 13, at 5 p.m. at the Microsoft Theater in L.A. Live. It will be hosted by wrestler John Cena and will be broadcast on ABC.
Former high school football player Zaevion Dobson will be honored with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award after he lost his life last December to save three girls in a gunfire. Additionally, reporter Craig Sager will receive the Jimmy V. Perseverance Award.
Top nominees in the list among others are LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Serena Williams, Flavia Pennetta, Novak Djokovic and Katie Ledecky. Bricio has been nominated in her category with UConn women’s basketball star Breanna Stewart, Penn State soccer player Raquel Rodriguez, University of Maryland lacrosse midfielder Taylor Cummings, and Michigan shortstop and second baseman Sierra Romero.
Stewart helped her team to win its fourth consecutive NCAA women’s basketball championships and is the second player to be named MVP in the finals for the fourth time. First pick in the 2016 WNBA Draft, she will play her first professional season for the Seattle Storm. Rodriguez was the second pick in the 2016 NWSL Draft. Internationally, she scored her native Costa Rica’s first-ever goal in the 2015 FIFA World Cup.
Cummings helped her team win two back-to-back national championships in 2014 and 2015. Romero was named a first team All-American every year during her college career and holds NCAA career records in runs and grand slams. The winner will be chosen with an online vote on the ESPN website.

USC men’s basketball received yet another transfer last week — Minnesota’s Charles Buggs. Buggs, a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota, started 21 games for the Golden Gophers last season and averaged 5.9 points and 2.9 rebounds per game. He was second on the team in field goal percentage (.462), third in free throw shooting (.769) and 3-point shooting (.319).
Buggs, who has one more year of eligibility, will be eligible to play for the Trojans immediately because he graduated from Minnesota last month and has chosen to pursue a graduate degree at USC.
He will be an important asset off the bench for Coach Andy Enfield, who has lost three big men this offseason. The first to go was forward Malik Martin, who averaged 1.8 points in 6.6 minutes per game. Next, forward Darion Clark who managed 4.6 rebounds per game despite only averaging 11 minutes per contest through an injury-laden season. And, most notably, starting center Nikola Jovanovic who averaged 12.1 points per game as well as 7.0 rebounds.
Buggs cannot fill this entire void, but his 6’9”, 230 lb. frame is sorely needed in USC’s front court which has all of a sudden become very undersized. Buggs will be the biggest man off the bench, and while he cannot rebound like Clark or shoot like Jovanovic, he will be a solid rotational player when either Bennie Boatwright or Chimezie Metu have to leave the floor.
Buggs will likely be the third forward on Enfield’s depth chart, behind the aforementioned sophomores and ahead of two incoming three-star recruits.
First is Nick Rakocevic, listed at 6’10” 210 lb. from St. Joseph High in Illinois and then Harrison Henderson, a 6’9”, 200 lb. from South Grand Prairie High in Texas.
Aside from Buggs, the Trojans front court is young and wild. Last year, Boatwright and Metu combined to average 2.3 turnovers per 40 minutes — an unsatisfactory mark for guys who mostly play off the ball. Additionally, Boatwright struggled shooting from inside the arc, making only 44 percent of two-point attempts.
Buggs — a graduate student with four years of college basketball experience and 28 career starts — might just make his biggest impact next year as a mentor to USC’s young forwards. He knows what he would do differently as an underclassman and can help the younger student-athletes mature both on and off the court.
Buggs was the second player last week to transfer to USC, making his decision four days after Duke transfer Derryck Thornton. Thornton, a point guard, will have to sit out next season, but even he will have valuable wisdom to share with USC’s young squad after learning under Coach Krzyzewski and starting through a Sweet Sixteen run.
Because of Thornton’s splash, Buggs’ move went under the radar. But his importance on the Trojans will not. In his final year of eligibility, Buggs will want to leave his mark at USC.
He will play quality minutes as the first or second power forward off the bench. Moreover, his maturity will help USC’s young stars stay composed both on and off the court. He certainly fills a sizeable portion of the void left by USC’s spring exodus of big men.

For college athletes, making it to the pros is the dream, and for a vast majority of them, it’s a dream that can’t wait one or two years.
Playing out all four years of eligibility is considered a stigma for NBA teams, who back away from an older prospect who needed more time to develop. Conversely, players feel the push from family, friends and agents to enter the draft and start earning a paycheck as soon as possible.
Granted, out of the 60 players selected in the 2016 NBA Draft in Brooklyn last Thursday, a quarter of them were seniors. But a record 30 underclassmen, including USC’s Nikola Jovanovic and Julian Jacobs, went undrafted.
That number is way too high, considering the NCAA altered its rules this year to give underclassmen more flexibility and time to choose to stay in school. In prior years, student-athletes had to declare for the draft in April before the draft combine in May. But now, players have until a week after the combine and can work out with one NBA team before making a decision, as long as they don’t hire an agent. This allows them to gauge interest and likelihood that they will be selected and for them to remain in school if the feedback is unsatisfactory.
For a prospect, an invite to the combine means they are on teams’ radar. Only two of the college players drafted this year did not receive an invite. Still, the rule change did not deter many eager NBA hopefuls. Neither Jacobs nor Jovanovic received an invite, but Jacobs had already hired an agent and Jovanovic went ahead and hired an agent anyway, even after being snubbed for the combine.
Jovanovic didn’t appear on many mock drafts, and being from Serbia, may receive some interest overseas. Jacobs was projected by some as a late second round selection, but went uncalled and could be bound for the D-League. Both juniors last season with a year of college eligibility left, we can only imagine what next year’s team would have looked like with the full squad returning and how much both of them would have improved with one more year to develop.
There certainly would have been no shame in that. USC, a team on the up-and-up after a breakthrough season in which it made its first NCAA tournament appearance in five years, seemed primed to return all its starters and key bench players and make a deeper run in 2017. But a slew of underclassmen either transferred or graduated early, and Jacobs and Jovanovic, who could have bolstered their draft status with another year of development and being leaders on a team that experts had in the top-20 nationally in preseason rankings, decided to take a gamble.
It’s a gamble that did not pay off for anyone. The Trojans will likely slip out of the Top 25 in future rankings and have to adjust to life without two of their top players, while Jacobs and Jovanovic face an uphill climb to stepping foot in the NBA.
To be fair, every prospect’s situation is different. Some need the money immediately to support their families. Others may feel like they’re ready and don’t want to risk a major injury in college, or they’re happy with playing in the D-League or overseas if they’re not selected.
But it’s also fair to say the majority of undrafted underclassmen would benefit from another year to develop, improve and potentially have a breakthrough, not to mention graduating and earning a valuable college degree.
Contrary to popular opinion, staying all four years — especially for players who aren’t hotshot prospects — should not be a scarlet letter. I have no issue with guys like Ben Simmons or Anthony Davis who go “one-and-done” in college in order to maximize their career value. But those talents are few and far between, and it’s not like there is zero track record of four-year players having success in the pros.
Draymond Green, who spent four years at Michigan State, immediately comes to mind. The 35th overall pick in 2012, Green exceeded expectations when he made the All-Star team last season. His versatility and high basketball IQ is apparent, and can be partially attributed to staying in school and gaining valuable experience and development before turning pro. He’s not alone – Tim Duncan, Damian Lillard, Chandler Parsons and David West are just some other four-year players who have seen tremendous success in the NBA.
It’s entirely possible that Jacobs and Jovanovic would not have been drafted next year, either. Nonetheless, I would sleep better at night knowing that I took full advantage of the scholarship I was given, maxed out all the development and experience I could get at the college level, received my diploma and entered the draft as the best player and person I could possibly be. But, as someone whose NBA dreams died a long time ago in my local YMCA league, that’s easy for me to say. Others with more realistic dreams have no time to waste, even just one more year.

Tom Kelly, USC’s broadcast voice for football and men’s basketball for 43 years, passed away from cancer in Encino Monday at the age of 88.
Kelly, who started his broadcasting career during his college days after sustaining an injury playing football at Northland College, started broadcasting Trojan football games in 1961 after working for various radio stations throughout the Midwest at the onset of his career. He would broadcast games over the radio from 1961 to 1965 and 1973 to 1988.
“His voice was something you could hear from a subway tunnel six blocks away,” said current USC Football Broadcaster Pete Arbogast to the Los Angeles Daily News. “He was the voice — he was the guy.”
Kelly eventually moved toward television, where he broadcasted games from 1989 until his retirement in 2003. In addition, he hosted the USC Sports Magazine Show and executive produced, hosted and narrated the Trojan Video Gold series. According to the Los Angeles Times, even after his retirement he was a staple at press boxes for USC until his death.
In addition to USC, Kelly called games for the San Diego Chargers, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and the now-defunct United States Football League’s Los Angeles Express, in addition to boxing matches.
“Having grown up in Southern California as a sports fan hearing all the great announcers, then as a big USC fan, I really studied his mannerisms and inflections and the excitement level he brought,” Arbogast said. “I remember getting up for USC-Notre Dames in South Bend that started at 10 a.m., getting all the snacks lined up and just listening to him call it, from pregame to postgame, because it wasn’t on TV.
Kelly was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001, the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Golden State Boxers Hall of Fame in 2003.
“For so many generations of Trojans, Tom Kelly was the voice of USC Athletics over the airwave, and what a voice he had,” USC Sports Information Director Tim Tessalone said to USC News. “His deep, rich voice was so identifiable with USC.”
Kelly is survived by wife and his four children — Kathleen Kelly Borisoff, Colleen Kelly, Kevin Kelly and Christopher Kelly — as well as a stepson and six grandchildren.
“It has been an unbelievable career … there’s no rhyme or reason how I managed to remain the Voice of the Trojans except luck and good fortune. … I don’t know how I qualified but I’m thankful,” Kelly said in his 2007 biography. “I enjoyed every moment and realize I was one of the fortunate ones.”

A year after the entire 2016 MFA class of Roski School of Art and Design withdrew in protest, HaeAhn Kwon, the only remaining student in the program, has announced that she will be leaving the University.
In an open letter to Provost Michael Quick, Kwon faulted the administration for mismanaging the studio arts program and alienating both students and faculty. Along with the social isolation from being the only MFA student, she also cited many of the same concerns as the departed 2016 class, including changes implemented by Roski Dean Erica Muhl and resignations by prominent faculty members.
“Although I knew I would be taking a risk entering a program fraught with controversy, I could not have anticipated the degree to which my entering this school would reaffirm the opinions of those who deem Roski to be on a downward spiral of predatory, wrongheaded and woefully oblivious decision making,” Kwon said in the statement. “I was both socially isolated as well as pedagogically misdirected due to a lack of structure and foresight in the nonexistent studio component of this ersatz program.”
Kwon claimed that her Group Critique class only met once, despite being scheduled to meet twice a week. She said she initially received an “Incomplete” in the course, which was then changed to a “B” without explanation. The University maintains that it does not offer courses that meet only once a semester, and says that she initially received only a “Missing Grade” notation, which was changed when her grade was entered, according to Associate Vice Provost Robin Romans.
Kwon also alleged that her fall semester lacked any review of her studio practice, and was told it would be postponed until the spring because Vice Dean of Critical Studies Amelia Jones had forgotten about that component of the program.
“I was the only student there, yet somehow it was acceptable that a lapse of memory could determine my entire experience and the school’s responsibility to its graduate program,” Kwon said. “It should not be accepted that the jettisoning of the studio program goes unaddressed, nor should Roski be allowed to carry on without accountability for the unacceptable and irresponsible representation of a program whose only option seems to be to burn itself to the ground in hopes that some phoenix may eventually rise.”
Kwon’s departure is only the latest in a series of setbacks for the MFA program following the 2013 appointment of Muhl as Roski dean. In 2014, MFA Program Director A.L. Steiner stepped down without a replacement. Soon after, longtime professor Frances Stark resigned, citing the administration’s lack of transparency and unethical behavior in a statement to USA Today. Her departure was followed by those of graduate coordinator Dwayne Moser and professor Sharon Lockhart.
All seven members of the 2016 MFA class withdrew last May in reaction to reduced funding packages, the loss of promised teaching assistant positions, faculty resignations and curriculum changes. After the negative publicity brought on by these departures, only Kwon, an international student from South Korea, accepted admission to the 2017 studio art MFA class. As an International Artist Fellow, her tuition and expenses were fully covered.
Romans responded to Kwon’s concerns in a statement issued by the University.
“HaeAhn requested numerous accommodations to offset the lack of MFA colleagues, including a request for double studio space, all of which were granted. Her Spring group critique included two graduate artists, award-winning senior artists and a trio of exceptional faculty,” Romans wrote. “HaeAhn received personal invitations from artists who offered impressive networking opportunities. To our dismay, she took advantage of very few of these.”
Nason McKnight, a senior majoring in fine arts, said Kwon’s grievances with the MFA program are emblematic of pervasive problems within Roski as a whole.
“I think Michael Quick and President Nikias have a vision for Roski that does not include bright and innovative contemporary artists like HaeAhn,” McKnight wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “President Nikias is most interested in building a flashy facade for USC that is focused on monetizing the experience of being at USC, rather than focusing on serious academic inquiry. Bright young artists like HaeAhn don’t belong at a school like that.”
Romans expressed regret for HaeAhn’s withdrawal, but stated that Roski will be moving forward with new faculty hires and a full class of MFA students joining USC in the fall.
“My view was that she would be the first student as we the program began building itself back up,” Romans said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I told her, ‘HaeAhn, my hope is that you’ll be able to look back on this moment and see that you are the student that helped re-energize the program toward a successful future.’ So I was sorry that things didn’t work out.”

Renée Elise Goldsberry, actress, singer, and USC alumna, has become a beacon of success for the next generation of actors from USC to strive for.
Goldsberry was awarded the 2016 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performances as Angelica Schuyler Church in the Broadway musical Hamilton. On June 12th, 2016, she performed at the Tony Awards ceremony along with her fellow Hamilton ensemble at the Beacon Theatre in New York.
She has performed in the production since its inception, as she was cast in Hamilton’s off-Broadway debut in 2015. The show transferred to the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway in August of 2015, and has seen unprecedented commercial and artistic success. Along with her praiseworthy, award-winning castmates, Goldsberry was recognized with a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album for the cast recording of Hamilton. For Goldsberry’s performance, she also won a Drama Desk Award and a Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical.
For students like Sasha Bartol, a music composition major who serves as an artistic director for USC’s Musical Theatre Repertory, the opportunity to see Goldsberry perform was inspiring.
“I have been lucky enough to see Hamilton, and it was genuinely one of the most exciting theatrical experiences of my life,” Bartol said. “From the moment I walked through the doors, the energy was palpable, because everyone I was with was just as ecstatic to be there as I was.”
Goldsberry was born in San Jose, Calif., and raised in Houston and Detroit. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in acting from Carnegie Mellon University, she graduated from the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music, where she obtained a master’s degree in vocal jazz performance.
In 2002, Goldsberry made her Broadway debut as Nala in Disney’s The Lion King. From 2005-2006, she originated the role of Nettie in the Broadway adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Color Purple. In 2007, she played the role of Mimi Marquez in the final Broadway production of Rent.
She has also found great success in television and film, with recurring television roles on Ally McBeal, One Life to Live and The Good Wife. She also made an appearance in the comedic film Sisters, starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
At the Tony awards ceremony, Goldsberry thanked her family and castmates, noting the collaborative effort. “When one of us win, we all win, because we are one.”
In her acceptance speech, she also expressed her gratitude for her family and theatrical opportunities.
“I have been praying my entire time to take the opportunity to say thank you to my parents who are here tonight, Ron and Betty … a lifetime of miracles one after another…the Lord gave me Benjamin and Brielle and he still gave me this,” Goldsberry said in her acceptance with her Tony held high.
Chris Sampson, USC Thornton School of Music vice dean of contemporary music, reminisced on his experiences watching Goldsberry perform at USC.
“Being a very highly accomplished musician — through her studies here — was just one of the skill sets that she was going to be able to leverage,” Sampson said.
Goldsberry performance in Hamilton includes songs such as, “Satisfied” and “The Schuyler Sisters,” exploring the relationship between two historical figures, Angelica Schuyler Church and Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton — the United States first Secretary of the Treasury — was married to Angelica Schuyler’s sister, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton.
“The thing about Renée’s career is that she is multitalented — that is what enables her to have the career she has,” Sampson said. “When I was observing her before, you can definitely tell she was an exceedingly charismatic performer. She really knew how to own a stage and be able to present very compelling performances.”
Sampson emphasized how musicians and young artists, especially in the Master’s program, progress and develop over time.
“At the time what we’re seeing with students is a work of progress,” Sampson said. “You’re actually seeing somebody start to assemble the skills that will end up resulting in a career, and you never know what the combination of those skills is going to turn out to be.”

The “Finger Fountain” is no more. Renovations at Gavin Herbert Plaza, located at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Trousdale Parkway, have led to the plaza’s central fountain, colloquially known by students as “Finger Fountain,” to be demolished. The statue was thought by many to be a challenging gesture toward rival school UCLA.

USC graduate Justin Jay spent four years studying music industry at the Thornton School of Music. During his time at the University, he cultivated his passion by being a DJ and collaborating with other aspiring artists in the USC music scene. Now, he is about to perform at the HARD Summer Music Festival for the third time.
The two-day festival boasts a talented lineup of artists. Headliners include rap legend Ice Cube, electronic dance group Major Lazer, producer DJ Khaled and DJs Madeon, Porter Robinson and Dillon Francis. With more than 80 performers across multiple music genres, HARD Summer will be a spectacle for many music fans.
In years past, HARD has acted as a springboard for up-and-coming electronic music producers and artists. Among those include USC alumnus Jay, who quickly rose to fame in the EDM community during his undergraduate years. The musician has performed at major events since then, including his first HARD Summer in 2014.
After graduating in May 2015, Justin Jay has continued his passion for music. This year, he produced multiple EP’s, released his latest work Fantastic Voyage (The Album!) and headlined at various music events such as Splash House. In addition, he has collaborated with artists Josh Taylor and Benny Bridges. Amidst his busy schedule, the L.A.-based musician will be returning to the HARD stage on Saturday, July 30.
“I’m very lucky to say that this is my third time, that’s pretty surreal. HARD is such a staple of L.A.’s music festival culture,” Jay said. “Playing in L.A. in general is always really fun because I don’t get to do it too often, and whenever I do it’s an amazing experience, so I’m looking forward to it.”
Justin Jay also spoke about his performance and what to expect from this year’s music festival. However, he wanted to keep most of the details a surprise.
“A large part of DJing is knowing how to improvise. The people who are familiar with my music might have expectations, but I don’t know,” he said. “People tend to come to my shows with an open mind and to have fun, and that’s all you really need.”
HARD returns for its 10th annual music festival July 30 and July 31. This year, the event will be moving to its new home at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, Calif. The venue will be host to more than 65,000 attendees and campers each day, as a response to the growing popularity of HARD Summer over the past several years.
Following the deaths of two women at last year’s festival, L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis urged the public to consider a temporary ban on raves hosted on government-owned properties, including HARD’s previous venue, the Pomona Fairplex. Despite this call, the county did not impose any strict laws on raves and music events. As a precautionary measure, HARD decided to move its event to the city of Fontana in San Bernardino County.

Thousands of fans gathered at the Shrine Auditorium last Tuesday to watch alternative rock band Cage the Elephant perform.
Lead vocalist Matt Shultz, along with openers Sunflower Bean and Portugal. The Man, impressed the crowd with their stunning performances. With Elvis Presley-like hip movements, boisterous body rolling and never-ending energy, Shultz, along with the rest of the bandmates, took the entire crowd by storm.
After the opening acts, the big moment of the night arrived when Cage the Elephant took the stage, relaxed and ready. Fellow bandmate, Brad Shultz, shook up the audience and told those sitting down to “get the f*ck up right now.”
The show began with “Cry Baby,” which led into an 18-track setlist that featured tracks across the band’s discography, from its eponymous debut album to its most recent Tell Me I’m Pretty. There was no stopping with Matt Schultz as he played each song with vigor and passion.
Cage the Elephant was loud, wild and most importantly, amazing rock and roll performers. The Kentucky natives cohesively worked to produce amazing sounds and tracks. Tunes like “Aberdeen,” “Mess Around,” and “Shake Me Down,” had the audience pumped as they jumped to the beat and even moshed along the aisles of seats.
Talent is an understatement for Cage the Elephant, and their ability to remain professional as musicians while letting loose and having fun prove this fact. “In One Ear” the band gave a performance full of heart-palpitating beats and rhythmic undertones.
During the show, concertgoers hopped on stage and interacted with the band. Lead vocalist Shultz did his part as a musician not only by performing, but also by being the host of an extravagant and wild show. He made those in attendance feel like an important aspect of the show. Shultz and the rest of Cage the Elephant proved to be strong and passionate stage performers.
Songs like “Telescope” and “Cigarette Daydreams” had the crowd in a dreamy daze. The songs had depth and meaning, showing the band’s versatility as rock performers and ordinary people. Shultz began “Telescope” with the strong, ominous words, “In a far and distant galaxy” and sang “I don’t think you understand, there’s nowhere left to turn, walls keep breaking” in the chorus.
Cage the Elephant demonstrated their mastery of contemporary rock through their performance at the Shrine. As high quality and in-depth performers, the band successfully showcased their artistry by connecting with audiences through music. Deep, intuitive and raw, Cage the Elephant blew the audience away with its incredible performance, groundbreaking energy and emotional vigor.

Here at USC, we know what it means to have an academic demeanor. Arguments in academic work are evaluated on their merits. Maintaining academic honesty, originality of thought and respect for arguments on both sides of an issue are expected in the work that Trojans do on a daily basis. How we interact with each other on- and off-campus, however, is in stark contrast to this established scholarly custom. Oftentimes, when conflicting opinions clash in public discourse, the merits of those views are not debated — they are labeled and categorized. Unfortunately, as seen here this past spring in the David Horowitz controversy, a fellow student who holds a particular opposing opinion can likewise be labeled. Refusing to give proper and respectful consideration to someone of a divergent viewpoint blind to the potential merits of that perspective. Doing so also forges an atmosphere not of dialogue, but of conflict. As a result, the merits of positions are not always debated; rhetorical appeals about them dominate instead. This trend is deeply concerning for those who hold scholarly atmosphere and academic custom in high regard.
In a community as large as USC’s, individuals often span the entirety of the political and social spectra. Inevitably, students will encounter others who do not share their views, background or core beliefs. This is normal and to be expected. Indeed, the purpose of a university is to foster discussions among such disparate groups in order to advance student understanding of each other and knowledge of the world. Taking the position that someone who does not conform to one’s expectations is necessarily wrong, though, threatens that objective. Such a hostile position does not inspire rational thought or well-balanced discussion; it engenders fear and anger. It goes without saying that these emotions do not lend themselves well to objective analysis of opinion.
For example, this past year, USC hosted a few controversial speakers, perhaps most prominently Conservative Writer David Horowitz. Students engaged in public and private discourse about the various speakers’ qualities and reliability, and although few perspectives were likely changed given how polarizing his presence was in particular, adequate respect was largely given to Horowitz’s views and supporters. So it should be at a university. However, there were some students who made comments that could be best described as anything but respectful towards their classmates, both privately and publicly. Ad hominem attacks, deliberately misstating the opposition’s views and logical fallacies have as much place in an academic setting and civil discourse as they do in scholarly work — none. At times, it appears as if there is a perennial race to the bottom — labels like sexist, racist and accusations of phobia are rampant in contemporary criticisms of opposing views. Sound logic, even-handedness and proof, however, are comparatively lacking.
This is not to say that all perspectives are equally valid, or that one should give as much credence to a well-supported position as to, say, the theory that the world is flat. Just as one would in an academic paper, however, a student ought to evaluate that position as fairly as they can and rely on their logical reasoning to guide their response to it. Doing so will invariably lead to a stronger refutation and a better presentation, especially to observers, who rightly expect civility and respect in academic discourse. If a position is in fact faulty or unsound, that will be laid bare as a result of thorough critical analysis. Making unwarranted claims or demanding that the opposition cease engaging in discourse is counter-productive and anything but appropriate as an academic.
Even if students disagree on a fundamental level, that does not mean that they ought to resort to irreverent conduct. Students should instead seek to inquire about why their colleague maintains their beliefs, and they should likewise be introspective and ask themselves the same kind of questions. Certainly, a student presenting their own views in a favorable light is to be expected, but understanding why they believe what they believe is critical to formulating the best defense of those convictions. Many times, fundamental beliefs rest upon imperfect assumptions. Refining these assumptions with knowledge gained during study and peer interactions ought to be the goal that students pursue when engaging in discussions of all kinds in all settings.
Academic discourse is a constant back-and-forth mental sparring session. Like a sparring match, the goal is not to cause harm to one’s opponent, but to highlight their weaknesses so that they may identify them and address them. Students should walk away from academic discourse much like they would a martial-arts tournament: with a deeper understanding of their faults, a greater appreciation for their strengths and an intense desire to improve. This is the core of what it means to be an academic.

It seems now more than ever in the digital age that cell phones are a controversial issue on the topic of being social and present in the moment. It’s important to realize that while cell phones can help people keep each other updated and simplify the process of getting together for social events, they shouldn’t be used in lieu of talking face-to-face or as a means to have a heartfelt conversation.
Cell phones have done wonders to help people connect with each other across distances. Seeing a friend update their status about the impressive internship they recently landed or the awesome views that they saw on their most recent vacation takes almost no time to share. With a few taps, someone’s latest life event can be condensed and made available for their friends to see on a Facebook status, an Instagram picture or some other post on one of the vast choices of social media outlets. It’s a simple process that isn’t lost on today’s society, especially with college students who simply can’t talk with their hometown friends like they used to. On the other hand, cell phones, in a way, have made people less social than ever before. Instead of talking with the people they are currently with in the moment, they use their phones to create superficial connections with people farther away from them. Seeing what’s going on in a friend’s life on Facebook while at a restaurant with friends is not only rude, but also detracts from the environment that everyone at the table is in. Some might think that being on their phone while their other friends are engaged in conversation isn’t hurting anyone but themselves, but it’s quite the opposite. They are missing out on the opportunity to connect with their peers, add to the conversation and, most importantly, be present in the moment. In The Atlantic, Sherry Turkle, an MIT psychologist who has devoted much of her time to studying the relationship between humans and technology, suggests that phones should be put away in “sacred spaces” such as the dinner table and other places to allow for intimate interactions.
It’s a sad sight to see when a group of college students spend the majority of their time in a group texting other people or being preoccupied with their screens as opposed to each other’s company. It’s especially annoying to see someone record a concert the whole time and post everything to their Snapchat story. It’s a pain for the person standing behind them to have their view of what’s happening on the stage obscured because the jackass in front of them is trying to capture the whole performance on their phones. It’s especially rude to the artist, who expects the crowd’s undivided attention, because why else would they be there? It’s OK to take a picture or a video or two, but after that, just enjoy the music. It’s a better experience to actually watch the artist do their thing as opposed to looking at them through a screen the entire time.
Cell phones have made conversation more convenient, but they have also diluted it to the point where it’s almost non-existent at times. The previous generation is always claiming that conversation in their day was leaps and bounds more exciting, and that they were much better conversationalists than the current generation as a result of not having the technology we do today. It’s possible that their claim is true, but it could also be a case of nostalgia affecting their memory. Regardless, some constructive advice could be taken from their ramblings. It is acceptable to use a cell phone for a short amount of time or, obviously, in an emergency, but it’s better to put it away in the company of others and live life in moment as it’s meant to be enjoyed.
