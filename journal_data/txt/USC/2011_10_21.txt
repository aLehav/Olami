One of the first images in Shawn Levy’s Real Steel is the reflection of a dazzling carnival, superimposed over a rough-edged, worn out Hugh Jackman.
In the scene that follows, Jackman’s character, Charlie Kenton, tries to pocket a little cash at the carnival by controlling a robot in a fight against a bull — the year is 2020, and bullfighting has turned into machines tackling and dealing out blows to the bulls.
The beginning scenes force audiences to think about technology’s presence in an ever-changing world. Particularly, how can human performers stay in high demand amid the massive proliferation of technological entertainment, like video games and artificial intelligence?
The two hours that follow the tantalizing first sequence, however, fail to fully explore the implications and depth of this idea.
The filmmakers instead opted for simple, crowd-pleasing motifs like redemption and compassion, making the film less impactful while remaining mainstream.
In that spirit, even if Levy’s film is not terribly compelling, it is admittedly exemplary and often grin-inducing popcorn entertainment.
The story, which is closely focused on the relationship between Charlie and his eleven-year-old-son, Max (Dakota Goyo), with whom Charlie has spent virtually no time, unfolds at a breakneck pace.
After learning about his wife’s death and inheriting custody of Max, Charlie finds himself down-and-out in the robot boxing trade, indebted to numerous promoters and without a solid robot to enter into competitions. He is much more concerned about money than he is about his son, who likes little about his father other than his affiliation with robots.
A robot Max discovers at a junkyard, potentially the key to Charlie’s comeback, prompts a story arc in which father and son come to realize each other’s true value. This arc will likely achieve one of the film’s central goals: pleasing audiences, especially kids and their families.
Apart from the absence of any real thematic edge, the film has other flaws. One that particularly stands out is the casting of Goyo as Max; a character who is supposed to be endearingly feisty comes off instead as shrill and overzealous.
This is largely because of a discrepancy between the character of Max on the page and the realization on screen: Goyo has too little charisma and too much sensitivity for the daring, ragged and foul-mouthed son of rough-and-tumble Charlie.
Levy’s directing, however, is utterly sincere, making it much easier for audiences to get on board with a story that some might otherwise consider silly. And the visual effects are pristine; the computer-generated robots have been integrated beautifully into dazzling live-action environments.
One particularly memorable and clever sequence involves Max revealing a talent for dance, which his robot, Atom, adopts when he mirrors Max’s movements. Charlie suggests that Max make this boy-and-robot dance a ritual before each fight. When Max finally does so, the result is incredibly enjoyable to watch and goes a long way to closing the emotional gap between the audience and Max’s character.
Ultimately, the aspects of the movie’s intriguing themes, though not fully explored, give the film higher credibility and make for a more thought-provoking cinematic experience.

Who will be the best receiver on the field?
Similar to USC’s contest against Cal last week, Saturday’s game features a wealth of talent at the wide receiver position. USC sophomore Robert Woods and Notre Dame junior Michael Floyd are among some of the best wide receivers in the country.
Woods looks to rebound after catching only 5 passes for 36 yards last week. He drew double teams the entire game against Cal and was unable to break free often. Nevertheless, he averages 13.1 yards per catch for the season. Notre Dame junior Michael Floyd has hauled in four touchdowns and 12.1 yards per catch. Both figure to pose a serious threat to the opposing secondaries that have had their fair share of struggles throughout the year.
USC also hopes Marqise Lee can contribute to the aerial attack. The freshman, who has drawn heavy praise from USC head coach Lane Kiffin, sustained an injury while scoring a touchdown against Cal. He told reporters during the week that he expects to be at 80 percent of full strength.
 
Can USC handle Notre Dames balance?
Notre Dame has done an excellent job of achieving balance in its offensive scheme. The Irish rank 29th nationally in both rushing and passing yards. Quarterback Tommy Rees, who beat USC a year ago, has run the offense rather efficiently since replacing Dayne Crist. The balance will keep USC on its heels. Against Cal, The Trojans stacked the box and forced the Golden Bears to throw. USC will not be able to overly commit to the run or pass because the Irish can deftly utilize both. USC’s defense is coming off of a stellar performance against Cal. In addition to forcing numerous turnovers, the defense held stout against the run, pressured the quarterback, and blanketed receivers.
 
Who will win the turnover battle?
Early in the year, both Notre Dame and USC ranked in the bottom quartile for turnover margin, but both teams have seen some improvement in recent weeks. Notre Dame still ranks 110th nationally. However, the Irish are even in turnover margin over the course of their current four-game winning streak. USC ranks 78th nationally in turnover margin after recording five takeaways against California. The five forced turnovers equaled the amount of turnovers USC created in its first five games.
 
How will USC fare in the running game?
Through the first six games, USC has struggled to consistently run the ball. Notre Dame allows 136 yards per game on the ground, so there is a chance the Trojans can find a steady rhythm. Redshirt senior Marc Tyler hopes to return after dislocating the back of his shoulder last week at Cal. It appears that Curtis McNeal will get the start for the Trojans. The shifty back has shown bursts of speed in limited action.
